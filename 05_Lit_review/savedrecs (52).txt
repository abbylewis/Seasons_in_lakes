J	Kinzelman, JL; McLellan, SL				Kinzelman, Julie L.; McLellan, Sandra L.			Success of science-based best management practices in reducing swimming bansa case study from Racine, Wisconsin, USA	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					International Tropical Ecology Congress	DEC 02-05, 2007	Dehradun, INDIA					The Great Lakes region possesses over 10,000 miles of shoreline (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) which are home to over 1,000 beaches. These beaches represent a recreational outlet for over 30 million people (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) and yet many of them remain inaccessible for periods of time each bathing season due to water quality advisories. The reason for these advisories is often elusive to beach managers, hence impeding their ability to craft appropriate mitigation measures. Even when the sources of contamination are known, remediation measures may not be put into practice due to the perception that they are too costly. However, a recent study has demonstrated that investing in environmental improvements which increase the number of days available for swimming in the Great Lakes region by 20% would generate $2-$3 billion dollars in direct economic effects. Therefore, while beach closings and advisories continue to rise overall, some Great Lakes communities have recognized the potential for municipal beaches to generate revenue and increase the quality of life for their citizens and have undertaken comprehensive studies to improve recreational water quality. In Racine, Wisconsin, USA, research conducted to identify pollution sources guided the development of better beach management practices such as ecologically appropriate beach modifications, improved mechanical beach grooming strategies, and the redesign of a major storm water outlet (including installation of a constructed wetland area). Resulting improvements have reduced bathing water quality advisories from 66% of days during the swimming season in 2000 to 5% or less in four consecutive years (2005-2008). These improvements to Racine beaches facilitated Blue Wave certification from the Clean Beaches Council (Washington, DC); thereby restoring public confidence, increasing beach use by the residents and tourists, and expanding the role of the beachfront in the local economy.

Clay mineral assemblages and analcime formation in a Palaeogene fluvial-lacustrine sequence (Maiz Gordo Formation Palaeogen) from northwestern Argentina	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Palaeogene Maiz Gordo Formation is one of the main lacustrine events recorded in northwestern Argentina. It consists of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone beds 200 m thick, deposited in a brackish-alkaline lake and braided alluvial systems. The Maiz Gordo Lake evolved mainly as a closed system, with brief periods as an open one. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to study samples from seven sites, corresponding respectively to proximal, intermediate, and transitional positions of the fluvial environment and marginal and inner-lake environment, focusing on the clay mineralogy and analcime formation. The basinward zonation of diagenetic minerals identified in the Maiz Gordo Lake was: mordenite -> analcime K-feldspar. Although not a typical zonation of saline-alkaline lakes, it does indicate an increase in salinity and alkalinity towards the centre. In proximal fluvial settings, smectite predominates at the base of the sequence, with scarce kaolinite. Towards the top, a striking increase in kaolinite content suggests a change from a relatively and climate with alternating humid and dry seasons, towards a warm and humid climate. Kaolinite content clearly decreases in a basinward direction. Such a variation is attributable to changes in hydro-geochemistry denoting the progressive influence of the brackish and alkaline lake water on interstitial pores. SEM images of intermediate fluvial samples reveal authigenesis of illite at the expense of kaolinite booklets. In littoral and inner-lake settings the clay fraction is composed of muscovite, sometimes with subordinate smectite. Analcime occurs in variable amounts in all sedimentary facies, in rock pores or filling veins. It forms subhedral square to hexagonal, or anhedral rounded crystals, denoting that they coarsened at low to moderate degrees of supersaturation. Although the mordenite identified in a fluvial level would have been the precursor of analcime in the Maiz Gordo Basin, no textural evidence of analcime formation through replacement of mordenite or other precursor zeolite was found. Hence it is more probable that analcime formation took place by direct authigenic precipitation or through the reaction between interstitial brines and clay minerals or plagioclase.

Nearly all compounds were predominantly found in the gas phase and only the less volatile such as some PCBs (e.g., 149, 118, 153, 138, and 180) were found in higher abundance in the particulate phase. HCB, 49-85 pg m(-3), is the dominant SOC. This compound is only found in the gas phase exhibiting uniform concentrations irrespective of season and air mass origin. SOC of present use, like HCHs and endosulfans, were found in higher concentrations in the warm periods, 3246 and 4-10 pg m(-3) in the gas + particulate phases, respectively, reflecting their seasonal pattern of use in many European countries. PCB and 4,4'-DDE, 39-42 and 4-6 pg m(-3) in the gas + particulate phases, respectively, also showed a seasonal trend despite neither the former nor the precursor of the latter (4,4'-DDT) being manufactured with their use drastically restricted since the 1980s. The seasonal differences are mainly due to a higher occurrence of air masses with strong continental inputs in the warm than in the cold periods. In this respect, samples whose air masses traveled at the high troposphere (backward air mass trajectories >6000 m) have been observed to carry considerably smaller PCB and 4,4'-DDE loads (9.3 +/- 2.8 and 0.4 +/- 0.05 pg m(-3), respectively) than overall average.

A decision support system for improving "fish friendly" flow compliance in the regulated Okanagan Lake and River System of British Columbia	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The Okanagan Valley of British Columbia (BC) has one of the lowest per-capita water supplies in Canada. Large fluctuations in water supplies routinely induce seasonal extremes of flood and drought conditions that challenge the ability of decision makers to operate complex water management infrastructure (dams, dikes, irrigation networks, flood control channels) to satisfy competing objectives to meet human-system versus natural-system needs (e.g. protect property, irrigate land, protect aquatic biota). An audit of water management performance from 1982 to 1997 indicated frequent non-compliance of water regulation decisions with "fish friendly," lake level and river discharge ranges specified by the 1982 Canada-BC Okanagan Basin Implementation Agreement (OBIA). Development and deployment of an environmental decision support system (EDSS) to provide real-time fish and water management tools (FWMT) to decision makers offered a potential means to improve the balance of water management decisions affecting both human and natural systems. The resultant FWMT-EDSS described here includes: a coupled set of four biophysical models of critical relationships among climate, fish and water that interact with a fifth water management rules model used to predict potential consequences of decisions for fish and other water users; a network of stations providing nearly instantaneous observations of lake elevation, river-discharge, precipitation and snowpack; a Structured Query Language (SQL) server database; an internet-accessible, graphical user interface; and a set of end users representing decision makers from government agencies, industry and local communities. FWMT provides a risk assessment framework to integrate biophysical processes, deal with multiple species and geographic locations, anticipate socioeconomic outcomes of water management decisions and increase cooperation among water users to improve fish and water management. Comparisons of observations from pre-FWMT "control" versus FWMT deployment years (n = 20 and 11, respectively) indicate significant improvements at both daily (p < 0.001) and annual (p < 0.05) time scales in compliance of water management decisions with OBIA guidelines to protect salmon during critical egg-to-fry emergence stages. These FWMT-enabled improvements were achieved without any increased damage to water system infrastructure, riparian property or agricultural production from flood or drought conditions.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				JAN 2	2015	40	1					87	110		10.1080/07011784.2014.985510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2014.985510													WOS:000350050400008

To evaluate the effect of stocked seeds (hatchery reared, originating from Lake Biwa and amphidromous stock) on the growth of native ayu in the river, monthly changes in origin composition and standard lengths of territorial ayu caught by Tomozuri angling were examined. Stock origin of 94 individuals caught in the middle reaches of the river from June to October 2010 were discriminated using the otolith Sr/Ca ratio and morphological characteristics. Percentage frequency of native ayu increased with time from 4.2 % in June to 73.3 % in September and 71.4 % in October. Hatchery-reared stocks were consistently caught throughout the sampling period (26.7-41.7 %), while the catch of both Lake Biwa and amphidromous stocks were limited to before August. Native ayu were significantly smaller than the others in July; however, no significant differences were found from August. Apparent growth of stocked seed stopped after August, while native ayu stopped in September. Thus, we suggest that large stocked ayu disturb the native ayu from making territories and stunt their growth in the early part of the season.

Testing and application of a two-dimensional hydrothermal/transport model for a long, deep, and narrow lake with moderate Burger number	INLAND WATERS												Setup, testing, and application of a 2-dimensional longitudinal-vertical hydrothermal/transport model (the transport submodel of CE-QUAL-W2) was documented for Cayuga Lake, New York, where the Rossby radius is on the order of the lake's width. The model was supported by long-term monitoring of meteorological and hydrologic drivers and calibrated and validated using in-lake temperature measurements made at multiple temporal and spatial scales over 16 years. Measurements included (1) temperature profiles at multiple lake sites for 10 years, (2) near-surface temperatures at one end of the lake for 16 years, (3) high frequency temperature at multiple depths for 2 years, and (4) seasonal measurements of a conservative passive tracer. Seiche activity imparted prominent signatures within these measurements. The model demonstrated excellent temporal stability, maintaining good performance in uninterrupted simulations over a period of 15 years. Performance was improved when modeling was supported by on-lake versus land-based meteorological measurements. The validated model was applied through numeric tracer experiments to evaluate various features of transport of interest to water quality issues for the lake, including (1) residence times of stream inputs within the entire lake and a smaller region defined bathymetrically as a shallow shelf, (2) transport and fate of negatively buoyant streams, and (3) the extent of transport from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion. This hydrothermal/transport model is appropriate to serve as the transport submodel for a forthcoming water quality model for this lake and for other high aspect (length to width) ratio lacustrine systems for which the internal Burger number is order one or greater.

Chemometric and trend analysis of water quality of the South Chennai lakes: an integrated environmental study	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS												In order to bring out the nature of the factors influencing lake water composition, multivariate statistical analysis and trend analysis were performed based on the hydrochemical data of the study area, namely, South Chennai. Change in land use pattern and settlements along the banks of the lakes alters the quality and quantity of the surface water. In the present study, the R-mode factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied to the geochemical parameters of the water to identify the factors affecting the chemical composition of the lake water. Dendograms of both the seasons give three major clusters, reflecting the groups of unpolluted to moderately polluted, polluted, and heavily polluted stations. The movement of stations from one cluster to another clearly brings out the seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the lake water. The complex hydrochemical data of the surface water were interpreted by condensing them into three major factors. Factor score analysis was used successfully to delineate the stations under study and the role of the contributing factors, and the nature of factors responsible for the variation in chemical composition of the water has been clearly brought out. Results of trend analysis using ArcGIS clearly indicate that the trend in water quality is deteriorating at a faster rate in the eastern part of the study area. It is understood that although natural shifts probably can account for some of the variation, it is most likely that human activities play a major role in affecting the water quality on a regional scale.

Lake sediments, and particularly sediment archives of volcanic lakes, help to decipher natural climate variability at seasonal to millennial scales, and help identifying causal mechanisms. Their importance includes their potential to provide precise and accurate inter-archive correlations (e.g., based on tephrochronology) and to record cyclicity and high frequency climate signals. We present a few examples of commonly used techniques and proxy-records to investigate past climatic variability and its influence to the history of the lakes and of their biota. This paper is rather a presentation of potentials and limits of palaeolimnological and limnogeological research on crater lakes, than a pervasive review of palaeolimnological studies on crater lakes. We show the importance of seismic stratigraphy for the selection of coring sites, and discuss problems in core chronology. Then we give examples of physical and chemical proxies, including magnetism, microfacies and oxygen and carbon stable isotopes from crater lake deposits mainly located in central and southern Europe. Finally, we present the use of air-transported (pollens) and lacustrine biological remains. The continuing need to develop new approaches and methods stimulated us to mention, as an example, the potential of the studies of subsurface biosphere, and the effects of microbiological metabolism on mineral diagenesis in sediments.

J	Nixdorf, E; Boehrer, B				Nixdorf, E.; Boehrer, B.			Quantitative analysis of biogeochemically controlled density stratification in an iron-meromictic lake	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lake stratification controls the cycling of dissolved matter within the water body. This is of particular interest in the case of meromictic lakes, where permanent density stratification of the deep water limits vertical transport, and a chemically different (reducing) milieu can be established. As a consequence, the geochemical setting and the mixing regime of a lake can stabilize each other mutually. We attempt a quantitative approach to the contribution of chemical reactions sustaining the density stratification. As an example, we chose the prominent case of iron meromixis in Waldsee near Doebern, a small lake that originated from near-surface underground mining of lignite. From a data set covering 4 years of monthly measured electrical conductivity profiles, we calculated summed conductivity as a quantitative variable reflecting the amount of electro-active substances in the entire lake. Seasonal variations followed the changing of the chemocline height. Coinciding changes of electrical conductivities in the monimolimnion indicated that a considerable share of substances, precipitated by the advancing oxygenated epilimnion, re-dissolved in the remaining anoxic deep waters and contributed considerably to the density stratification. In addition, we designed a lab experiment, in which we removed iron compounds and organic material from monimolimnetic waters by introducing air bubbles. Precipitates could be identified by visual inspection. Eventually, the remaining solutes in the aerated water layer looked similar to mixolimnetic Waldsee water. Due to its reduced concentration of solutes, this water became less dense and remained floating on nearly unchanged monimolimnetic water. In conclusion, iron meromixis as seen in Waldsee did not require two different sources of incoming waters, but the inflow of iron-rich deep groundwater and the aeration through the lake surface were fully sufficient for the formation of iron meromixis.

J	Simoni, J; Floress, K				Simoni, Jennifer; Floress, Kristin			An exploration of place meanings among residents in central Wisconsin	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A mail survey of all residents in the surface and ground watersheds of an 11 lake area in central Wisconsin was conducted in 2012 to assess the behaviors, attitudes, awareness of issues, and attachment to lakes to incorporate social information into lake management. Place attachment is a complex concept composed of many dimensions to describe an individual's relationship to a place. This study tested the dimensional structure, validity, and transferability of a previously developed place meanings scale. The factors were then further tested to see if any differences existed among type of ownership (lakefront property owners versus non-lakefront property owners), involvement in lake groups, and seasonal residency in the level of meanings assigned to the lakes. Significant differences were found among type of ownership, involvement in lake groups, and seasonal residency on several place meaning domains. The dimensional scale structure revealed through this study differed somewhat from the original place meanings scale being tested, although the overall consistency on a new population has provided evidence for the transferability of place meanings scales in similar settings. Implications for management include the need to develop targeted outreach plans based on what is valued by residents instead of relying only on lake-by-lake segmentation.

We explored the dynamics of bacterial community composition (BCC) monthly over a 7 yr period from 2004 to 2010, within a large, shallow, eutrophic lake. Seasonal and year-to-year changes in BCC were assessed using a PCR-based 16S rDNA fingerprinting technique based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The bacterial operational taxonomic units differed between ice-free and ice-covered periods, and many recurred in specific seasons in consecutive years. The most significant variables related to within-year variation were temperature and the concentration of nutrients. Year-to-year variability was larger than within-year variability. Therefore, interannual variability tended to mask seasonal changes in BCC. The interannual differences in BCC were strongly related to abiotic conditions such as water level fluctuations that generally lead to water column mixing and sediment resuspension, and the qualitative composition of dissolved humic material. All highly related biotic variables that describe the total plankton community (in addition to bacteria, including phyto-, protozoo- and metazooplankton) were found to be modulated primarily by changes in the abiotic environment.

Growth and feeding efficiency of wild and aquaculture genotypes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) common to Lake Huron, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Selective breeding of salmonid fishes for the purpose of commercial aquaculture has resulted in domesticated strains possessing a divergent physiological and behavioral phenotype from that of wild conspecifics. Freshwater production of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been occurring in regions of Lake Huron, Canada, for decades yet the growth and performance of domestic (aquaculture) versus wild (naturalized) strains are poorly understood. We conducted two trials to examine growth differences between size-matched wild and domestic strains of juvenile rainbow trout: (1) reared separately and fed to satiation; and (2) reared together and fed a reduced ration to induce competition. Additionally, we used bioenergetics models to assess strain-specific growth rates across a range of water temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 18 degrees C) as well as Lake Huron temperatures during the open-water season. Domestic rainbow trout showed a growth advantage throughout the 102 d trials, and by the end of the study had achieved a mass >two-fold that of the wild strain and had greater fork length, condition, and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) under both treatments. Rapid growth of domestic strain fish was achieved through the combination of enhanced feed consumption (by similar to 40%) and feeding efficiency (up to 60% lower feed conversion ratio) relative to wild fish. Divergence in growth rates between strains was most pronounced (>3 x) when modeled with Lake Huron open-water temperatures.

"Nobody Knows the way of the Caribou": Rangifer hunting at 45° North Latitude	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												While caribou hunting structures are well known in the circumpolar region, equivalent features are difficult to investigate further south due to significant changes in sea level and subsequent human activity. The discovery of hunting structures on submerged landforms beneath modern Lake Huron provides a new window into caribou hunting in the mid-latitudes. This paper summarizes current findings and considers both the strategies for hunting caribou and the necessary organizational implications for such activities on the Alpena-Amberley Ridge. It is shown that many of the features known in the circumpolar region are also present in the mid-latitudes, but that significant differences are also observed. Many of these differences seem attributable to the seasonal migration of vast caribou herds across the causeway-like setting of the Alpena-Amberley Ridge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere of Phragmites australis in lake velencei (Hungary) revealed by a combined cultivation-based and molecular approach	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The community structure of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) associated with reed (Phragmites australis) rhizosphere in Lake Velencei (Hungary) was investigated by using cultivation-based and molecular methods. The cultivation methods were restricted to recover lactate-utilizing species with the exclusion of Desulfobacter and some Desulfobacterium species presumably not being dominant members of the examined community. The most-probable-number (MPN) estimations of lactate-utilizing SRB showed that the cell counts in reed rhizosphere were at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the bulk sediment. The number of endospores was low compared to the total SRB counts. From the highest positive dilution of MPN series, 47 strains were isolated and grouped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and dsrAB (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) genes. Contrary to the physiological diversity of the isolates, the combined results of RFLP analysis revealed higher diversity at species as well as at subspecies level. Based on the partial 16S rRNA sequences, the representative strains were closely affiliated with the genera Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum. The partial dsrAB sequences of the clones, recovered after isolation and PCR amplification of the community DNA, were related to hitherto uncultured species of the genera Desulfovibrio and Desulfobulbus. Nevertheless, the representative of the second largest clone group was shown to be closely affiliated with the sequenced dsrAB gene of a strain isolated from the same environment and identified as Desulfovibrio alcoholivorans. Another clone sequence was closely related to a possible novel species also isolated within the scope of this work.

In factorial field experiments, we manipulated grazer access and nutrient supply to periphyton communities and measured the effects on algal, ciliate, meiofaunal, and bacterial biomass. We tested whether grazing macrozoobenthos affects all periphytic components (generalist consumption), whether nutrient effects propagate through the community, and whether interactions between the different periphyton groups allow for indirect feedback mechanisms. The experiments were conducted during three different seasons in a mesoeutrophic lake in Sweden (Lake Erken) and at an adjacent coastal marine site (Vaddo) of similar productivity, but with contrasting grazer fauna. We found strong direct effects of nutrients and grazing on algae at both sites. Algal biomass increased in fertilized treatments and was significantly reduced when grazers were present. The algae clearly dominated the system quantitatively and were positively correlated to the biomass of ciliates and meiofauna. The effects of grazing and nutrients were more complex for heterotrophs than for algae. Generally, the presence of grazers tended to increase the biomass of bacteria, ciliates, and meiofauna. Thus, macrograzers were not generalist consumers of the entire community, but mainly reduced algae. Furthermore, the results suggested strong indirect effects of grazing, presumably through changes in nutrient supply and algal size structure. Nutrient enrichment had weak and inconsistent effects on bacterial, ciliate, and meiofaunal biomass. There was thus no complete propagation of bottom-up effects through the community, and strong internal feedback mechanisms within the periphyton mediated the effects of macroconsumers and nutrient enrichment.

Recent sedimentation in an Amazon tidal tributary: Integrated analysis of morphology and sedimentology	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Xingu River is an important tributary of the Amazon River, contributing 5% of its total water discharge. Nevertheless, it does not contribute substantially to the sediment load. The lower reach of the Xingu River forms a ria, a result of the Holocene sea-level rise. The Xingu is also classified as a tidal river, with tides >1 m at its confluence with the Amazon River. This study evaluated the morphology and sedimentology of the area, correlating both with hydrodynamics to understand the infilling process of the Xingu ria. The study area encompasses a stretch of similar to 160 km, between the Xingu-Amazon confluence and the narrowing of the fluvial channel. During the season of maximum sediment-discharge of the Amazon River (i.e., Feb 2016), 109 bottom sediment samples were collected. Eleven of the sampling sites were re-sampled during the minimum water-discharge period of both rivers (i.e., Nov 2016). During the maximum water-discharge period of the Amazon River (i.e., Jun 2018), additional water-level measurements were undertaken simultaneously at several locations along the Xingu River. The ria morphology was evaluated on the basis of the bathymetric surveys of the Brazilian Navy (DHN). The results show that the infilling process of the ria has taken place from both the upstream and downstream directions. From upstream, the Xingu River is forming a prominent bayhead delta. From the Xingu-Amazon River confluence, tides have transported Amazon River sediments into the Xingu Ria. There is a central portion of the ria lake with a large cross-sectional area, where relatively small amounts of muddy sediments are accumulating in a quiescent environment. Sands prevail along the lateral margins, where wave action causes bluff erosion and limits fine-sediment deposition. Sands are also common in the bayhead delta and the confluence areas. Results suggest that the sediment input from the Amazon River into the Xingu ria has been reduced over time, likely as result of a reduction in tidally driven flux from the Amazon River into the Xingu River, which has occurred with a gradual increase in the constriction of the confluence as Amazon floodplains prograde.					; Silva, Ariane/KLY-7819-2024; Asp, Nils E./J-6226-2012; Asp, Nils/J-6226-2012; Souza-Filho, Pedro Walfir/J-4958-2012	Silva, Ariane M.

The take surface is about 280km(2) and maximal depth is 65 m. Total inflow just after the rainy season was estimated to be about 860000m(3) day(-1), and the take water was drained from a newly excavated channel at a rate of 960000m(3) day(-1). We may have to expect undesirable lowering of the water level by this new drainage, especially in the dry season. Thermocline developed from 20 to 30m depth, and the euphotic zone reached the 50m depth. Dissolved oxygen in surface water was supersaturated as in productive lakes, although there were no large point and nonpoint sources of nutrient in the catchment. Vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and primary production suggested the presence of photoinhibition. What should be noted about the flora and fauna is that a Chara zone and a shell zone were distributed at about 30 or 40 m of depth.					; Matsunaka, Tetsuya/P-4754-2015	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													1439-8621					DEC	2007	8	3					331	335		10.1007/s10201-007-0208-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-007-0208-2													WOS:000251677800015

We compared six methods to measure the concentration of Chl a (CChl-a) in two optically different lakes: stratified clear-water Lake Saadjarv and non-stratified turbid Lake Vortsjarv. CChl-a was estimated from: in vitro (spectrophotometric, high-performance liquid chromatography); fluorescence (in situ automated high-frequency measurement (AHFM) buoys) and spectral (in situ high-frequency hyperspectral above-water radiometer (WISPStation), satellites Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI) measurements. The agreement between methods ranged from weak (R-2 = 0.26) to strong (R-2 = 0.93). The consistency was better in turbid lake compared to the clear-water lake where the vertical and short-term temporal variability of the CChl-a was larger. The agreement between the methods depends on multiple factors, e.g., the environmental and in-water conditions, placement of sensors, sensitivity of algorithms. Also in case of some methods, seasonal bias can be detected in both lakes due to signal strength and background turbidity. The inherent differences of the methods should be studied before the synergistic use of data which will clearly increase the spatial (via satellites), temporal (AHFM buoy, WISPStation and satellites) and vertical (profiling AHFM buoy) coverage of data necessary to advance the research on phytoplankton dynamics in lakes.

A total of 635 specimens (44.84% female and 55.16% male) were collected from the local fisherman during the hunting season between April 2018 to April 2019. Mean fork length (FL) (mm, min-max), mean W (g, min-max) and mean CF (value, min-max) were estimated as 67.31 mm (40.10 - 97.77 mm), 2.57g (0.53 - 7.50 g), and 0.790 (0.170-1.520) for all individuals. The length-weight relationships were determined W=0.00001437L(2.8602) for female, W=0.00001570L(2.8266) for male and W=0.00001328L(2.8717) for all individuals. The von Bertalanffy equations were determined L-t=136.218 [1-e((-0.240(t+0.51)))] for female, Lt=155.042 [1-e((-0.185(t+0.73)))] for male, and Lt=146.916 [1-e((-0.205(t+0.64)))] for all individuals.

In particular, artificial impoundments, which may occur during the dry season in wetlands, increase the periods of waterlogging. However, little is known about their potential effects on biogeochemical cycling. To evaluate how impoundments affect nitrogen (N) cycling in the floodplain ecosystem, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate N dynamics and the potential N-gene changes in the root-zone soil of the dominant plant in one large floodplain lake (Poyang Lake, China). The results indicated that, compared with the control, the 12 cm submergence treatment (SP12) caused NH4+-N accumulation in the root-zone soil on day 14 and day 41. On the contrary, NO3--N levels in SP12 were statistically lower than those in the control from day 7 to day 28. The curve of organic N had a tendency of declining as a whole. Changes in N-gene abundances revealed that SP12 significantly inhibited nitrification and enhanced denitrification in root-zone soil. Moreover, SP12 enhanced the links and complexity of the N-gene network, reflecting the increased correlations among the N transformations under flooding stress. Considering the increasing demand for WLR worldwide, the study about the effects of anti-seasonal submergence on biogeochemical cycling in floodplains provides insight into the ecological impacts of anthropogenic activities.

We examined the predominantly terrestrial strata of North China to reveal that, on the contrary, there was little substantial sedimentological change during the Permo-Triassic mass extinction. The crisis level occurs in the upper Sunjiagou Formation, where a range of environments, including low-sinuosity rivers, distally terminating alluvial fans, and mud-dominated coastal plains are recorded. A major sedimentological change occurred slightly higher, within the lowest Triassic, and involved a switch to braided fluvial and shallow lacustrine/fluviodeltaic conditions of the Liujiagou Formation. Later in the Early Triassic, fine-grained, playa lake, and alluvial plain facies became sols are present throughout the basin fill and record a transition from Aridisols and Vertisols in the Late Permian to Inceptisols in the Early Triassic followed by gleyed Aridisols, Vertisols, and Inceptisols later in the Early Triassic. Previously reported aeolian facies from Lower Triassic strata were not encountered in this study and were unlikely to have occurred given the prevalence of lacustrine and fluvial conditions at this time. Overall, the North China Basin experienced an increase in seasonal rainfall in the latest Permian and a base-level rise that introduced marine conditions into the southwest of the basin. During the Early Triassic, seasonal or interannual rainfall was frequent, with strong evaporation in a hot climate. Over-all, substantial sedimentological changes occurred in the terrestrial Permo-Triassic environments of North China, but despite earlier claims from studies in North China and elsewhere, there was no abrupt transi-tion in fluvial styles around the Permo-Trias-sic mass extinction.

Contamination of the food chain with heavy metals in water sources may impact the health of consumers adversely. This study aimed to determine the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu , Zn in the invasive fish species Carassius gibelio inhabiting two important lakes in Turkiye: Lake Beysehir and Lake Egirdir, from the Lake District Region and assess any health risks posed by the consumption of these species. For this purpose, C. gibelio species were obtained from two lakes in dry and rainy seasons and heavy metal concentrations were determined via ICP-OES analyses. The Cd concentrations in the muscle samples obtained from both lakes were below the analysis limits. The mean heavy metal concentrations (mg/kg) in the Beysehir and Egirdir lake samples were found as Pb: 0.32, Cr: 0.09, Cu: 0.52, and Zn: 6.88 and Pb: 0.88, Cr: 0.08, Cu: 0.46, and Zn: 12.6, respectively. The average heavy metal concentrations in the muscle tissues were below the national/international legislation limits, and the estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotients (THQs), total THQs (TTHQs), and carcinogenic rates (CRs) did not exceed these limits. The results suggested that the consumption of these invasive fish species from these two lakes might not pose any potential health risk for consumers. Transference values (TF) for the digestive tract were also calculated, and biomagnification was determined for Pb, Cd, and Cr. Risk assessment studies are very important in terms of evaluating the effects of fish consumption on human health via applying different indices. This is the first study in which heavy metal concentrations were determined simultaneously in Lake Beysehir and Lake Egirdir, and the public health risk of consuming their invasive fish species was estimated.

Secchi depth (SD), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were measured to aid the quantification of trophic state condition of the lake using Carlson trophic state index (CTSI). The trophic state index (TSI) values based on SD, TP and Chl-a values were 60.82 +/- 5.35, 68.99 +/- 11.04 and 61.74 +/- 7.51, respectively. March 2020 recorded the highest mean CSTI value (70.14 +/- 4.04), while in September 2020, the lowest mean value (58.03 +/- 6.22) was obtained. Based on CTSI values, the lake was eutrophic in both dry and wet seasons albeit with differences in the values. The eutrophic state of the lake is possibly attributed to nutrients inflow into the lake via runoff and drainage from farmlands. The negative value of TSI-Chl-a-TSI-TP deviation pointed out that the lake is not phosphorus limited, while the positive TSI-Chl-a-TSI-SD mean deviation value revealed the effect of Chl-a and TP on the lake's transparency. The study recommends the necessity to develop guidelines for the trophic status monitoring of Lake Bunyonyi since results suggest the deteriorating lake condition.					; Pamba, Siajali/ABE-5824-2020; Lyimo, Thomas/ABC-1507-2020	Saturday, Alex/0000-0002-7230-6645; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				JAN	2023	13	1							7	10.1007/s13201-022-01816-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01816-y													WOS:000884308300002

Eutrophication has become of primary importance in altering aquatic ecosystem functioning. Quantifying the CO2 emissions by inland aquatic ecosystems of different trophic statuses may provide helpful information about the role of eutrophication on greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigated diel and seasonal carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and emissions in three tropical karst lakes with different trophic statuses. We measured CO2 emissions using static floating chambers twice daily during the rainy/warm and dry/cold seasons while the lakes were thermally stratified and mixed, respectively. The CO2 concentration was estimated by gas chromatography and photoacoustic spectroscopy. The results showed a significant seasonal variation in the dissolved CO2 concentration (C-CO2) and the CO2 flux (F-CO2), with the largest values in the rainy/warm season but not along the diel cycle. The C-CO2 values ranged from 13.3 to 168.6 mu mol L-1 averaging 41.9 +/- 35.3 mu mol L-1 over the rainy/warm season and from 12.9 to 38.0 mu mol L-1 with an average of 21.0 +/- 7.2 mu mol L-1 over the dry/cold season. The F-CO2 values ranged from 0.2 to 12.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) averaging 4.9 +/- 4.0 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) over the rainy/warm season and from 0.1 to 1.7 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) with an average of 0.8 +/- 0.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) over the dry/cold season. During the rainy/warm season the emission was higher in the eutrophic lake San Lorenzo (9.1 +/- 1.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)), and during the dry/cold the highest emission was recorded in the mesotrophic lake San Jose (1.42 +/- 0.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). Our results indicated that eutrophication in tropical karst lakes increased CO2 evasion rates to the atmosphere mainly due to the persistence of anoxia in most of the lake's water column, which maintained high rates of anaerobic respiration coupled with the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Contrarily, groundwater inflows that provide rich-dissolved inorganic carbon waters sustain emissions in meso and oligotrophic karstic tropical lakes.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Soria-Reinoso, Ismael/AAE-7407-2022; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/KPY-5742-2024; Merino-Ibarra, Martín/KPY-5742-2024; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; Rivera-Herrera, Erika Montserrat/0000-0002-2570-7542; Garcia Oliva, Felipe/0000-0003-4138-1850; Soria-Reinoso, Ismael/0000-0003-1342-2379; Vargas-Sanchez, Mariana/0000-0002-4681-2755; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101; 														2073-4441				JAN	2023	15	1							13	10.3390/w15010013	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15010013													WOS:000910246900001

In this paper, Liangxi River, Taihu Basin, was selected as the research area. Combined with field investigation, a 2D water environment mathematical model was developed to simulate the chl-a distribution in Liangxi River. An indicator (Transverse Distribution Center, TDC) and its normalized form (NTDC) to quantitatively represent material transverse distribution in rivers is proposed and coupled in the model. The calculation showed that TDC and NTDC had the property of random fluctuation, seasonal consistency, and water transfer dependence. The multiple regression equation with normalized data indicated that the maximum offset, average variation rate, and average reverting rate of Liangxi River chl-a NTDC were most affected by the chl-a dry matter flux ratio between tributaries and the mainstream, followed by flow and chl-a concentration ratio. From the perspective of river morphology, for different river width change modes and river bending directions, when water flows into and out of these river sections, the chl-a transverse distribution is subject to different specific effects. In addition, the position of nutrients and dissolved oxygen significantly affected the position of chl-a growth when the N/P ratio was not very high. Conversely, a high N/P ratio may contribute to decrease of the chl-a concentration. Proliferation with abundant nutrients may cause the settlement of chl-a resulting in a decrease of chl-a in the water column.					; He, Xinchen/NRB-1033-2025; , 袁伟皓/AAF-9458-2020	He, Xinchen/0000-0002-4391-6911; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2021	14	3							e2274	10.1002/eco.2274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2274		JAN 2021											WOS:000605752200001

Primary and secondary consumers contribute to the abundance and standing stock biomass, which both vary seasonally. By means of taxa- and size-specific carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis, the path of pollutants through zooplankton is traced and seasonal changes are addressed, in an effort to understand pollutant dynamics in the pelagic food web. We analyzed zooplankton plurennial changes in concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its relatives (DDTs) and in taxa-specific delta N-15 signatures in two size fractions, >= 450 mu m and >= 850 mu m, representative of the major part of zooplankton standing stock biomass and of the fraction to which fish predation is mainly directed, respectively. Our work is aimed at verifying: (1) A link between nitrogen isotopic signatures and pollutant concentrations; (2) the predominance of size versus seasonality for concentration of pollutants; and (3) the contribution of secondary versus primary consumers to carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures. We found a prevalence of seasonality versus size in pollutant concentrations and isotopic signatures. The taxa-specific delta N-15 results correlated to pollutant concentrations, by means of taxa contribution to standing stock biomass and delta N-15 isotopic signatures. This is a step forward to understanding the taxa-specific role in pollutant transfer to planktivores and of zooplankton enrichment in PCBs and DDTs.					; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019	CICALA, DAVIDE/0000-0001-9942-9859; Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; Piscia, Roberta/0000-0003-3123-7759; 													2073-4441					JUL	2019	11	7							1490	10.3390/w11071490	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071490													WOS:000480632300175

Sequential applications of diquat to control flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) in mesocosms	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) is an aggressive, invasive, aquatic plant spreading throughout water bodies in the northern United States and southern Canada, displacing many native aquatic/wetland plants. This can disrupt ecosystem processes and affect human uses of water bodies. Operational management in Detroit Lakes, MN, reduced flowering rush biomass and propagules by > 80% using two sequential, submersed applications of diquat (0.37 mg L-1 ) per growing season (4 wk apart). However, in dense colonies, long-term control has taken years to achieve, suggesting a more aggressive treatment regime may be necessary. A mesocosm study was initiated in 2015 and repeated in 2016 to further investigate diquat (0.37 mg L-1 ; 12 h exposure time) efficacy using one to four biweekly (every other week) sequential herbicide applications to improve flowering rush control. All treatments reduced flowering rush aboveground and belowground biomass and propagule (rhizome buds) density compared with non-treated reference plants (P < 0.001) at 8 and 52 wk after initial treatment (WAIT). There were no differences among diquat treatments, regardless of the number of applications. Diquat treatments reduced aboveground biomass 57 to 99% and 62 to 100% at 8 and 52 WAIT, respectively. Diquat treatments reduced belowground biomass 73 to 92% and 71 to 100% at 8 and 52 WAIT, respectively. Propagules were reduced 65 to 97% and 67 to 100% by treatments at 8 and 52 WAIT, respectively. This research suggests a more aggressive treatment protocol will not benefit resource managers; however, these results need to be field verified before existing treatment protocols are altered.																			0146-6623					JUL	2019	57						56	61																WOS:000478712600002

Therefore, determining the factors shaping spatial and temporal patterns is particularly essential in the most susceptible, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lakes. We analyzed spatiotemporal variations in dissolved organic carbon concentration and dissolved organic matter optical properties (absorption and fluorescence) in 11 transparent lakes located above tree line in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain), and we assessed potential external (evaporation and atmospheric deposition) and internal (bacterial abundance, bacterial production, chlorophyll a, and catchment vegetation) drivers of DOM patterns. At spatial and temporal scales, bacteria were related to chromophoric DOM (CDOM). At the temporal scale, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in dust deposition and evaporation were found to have a significant influence on DOC and CDOM in two Sierra Nevada lakes studied during the ice-free periods of 2000-2002. DOC concentrations and absorption coefficients at 320 nm were strongly correlated over the spatial scale (n = 11, R-2 = 0.86; p < 0.01), but inconsistently correlated over time, indicating seasonal and interannual variability in external factors and a differential response of DOC concentration and CDOM to these factors. At the continental scale, higher mean DOC concentrations and more CDOM in lakes of the Sierra Nevada than in lakes of the Pyrenees and Alps may be due to a combination of more extreme evaporation, and greater atmospheric dust deposition.

Sea level decreases led to the separation of the Aral Sea into two basins-the Small Aral in the north and the Big Aral in the south. For several decades there were no continuous observations of Aral Sea level, and the few data that exist are fragmentary or unavailable. We present observations of the Big Aral Sea level estimated from the TOPEX/Poseidon (TIP) altimetry with high temporal resolution over the last decade (1993-2004). Since sea volume is one of the key parameters for the studies of water balance, we use the TIP-derived time series of sea level and a dedicated digital bathymetry model (DBM) to reconstruct temporal changes in the Aral Sea surface and volume. We introduce variations of the sea volume as the new constraint for the water budget of the Big Aral Sea. This is an important step toward estimating detailed seasonal and interannual changes of the water budget. We assess various existing components of the water budget of the Aral Sea and discuss the quality of the existing data and their applicability for establishing detailed water balance. In particular, large uncertainties in estimating the evaporation and underground water supply are addressed. Desiccation of the Aral Sea resulted in dramatic changes in the salinity regime and, consequently, affected its aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss changes in the aquatic fauna and their possible evolution under continuing desiccation of the Big Aral Sea. Combining satellite altimetry with other parameters of the water budget offers a promising potential for assessing temporal changes in the water budget of and or semi-ard regions, even those with a poor ground monitoring network.

Mercury (Hg) concentrations in epaxial muscle by age and weight for 31 populations of walleye were used to evaluate the relative importance of differences in consumption and activity in generating sexual size dimorphism. Growth efficiency by sex, age, and maturity is estimated by a ratio of annual increments in weight (g) to annual increments of Hg (mg), using the pooled changes in weight and Hg loadings of males and females from all lakes. The higher growth rates of females arise from greater consumption and higher growth efficiency. Growth efficiency of both sexes is similar before maturity, but the growth efficiency of mature males is substantially lower than that of either immature males or mature females. We propose that the inferior growth efficiency of males is a function of the greater activity of males, particularly during the spawning season when scramble competition for fertilization is likely to produce substantial increases in male fitness as a result of increased efforts to find and spawn with females.

J	Forootan, E; Mehrnegar, N				Forootan, Ehsan; Mehrnegar, Nooshin			A hierarchical Constrained Bayesian (ConBay) approach to jointly estimate water storage and Post-Glacial Rebound from GRACE(-FO) and GNSS data	ALL EARTH												Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) have become an indispensable tool in monitoring global mass variations. However, separating GRACE(-FO) signals into its individual Terrestrial Water Storage Changes (TWSC) and surface deformation contributors, i.e. Post-Glacial Rebound (PGR), is desirable for many hydro-climatic and geophysical applications. In this study, a hierarchical constrained Bayesian (ConBay) approach is formulated to apply GRACE(-FO) fields and the uplift rate measurements from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations to simultaneously estimate the contribution of TWSC and PGR. The proposed approach is formulated based on a hierarchical Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimisation algorithm within a dynamic multivariate state-space model, while accounting for the uncertainties of a priori information and observations. The numerical implementation is demonstrated over the Great Lakes area, covering 2003-2017, where the W3RA water balance and the ICE-5G(VM2) and ICE-6G-D(VM5a) GIA models are merged with GRACE and GNSS data. Validations are performed against independent measurements, which indicate that the average root-mean-squares-of-differences between the PGR estimates and independent measurements reduced by 72 % after merging observations with models through ConBay. The ConBay updates, introduced to the long-term trends, as well as the seasonal and inter-annual components, are found to be realistic.

J	Alric, B; Perga, ME				Alric, Benjamin; Perga, Marie-Elodie			Effects of production, sedimentation and taphonomic processes on the composition and size structure of sedimenting cladoceran remains in a large deep subalpine lake: paleo-ecological implications	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes in the composition and size structure of cladoceran remains collected in sediment traps (ST) were compared at a monthly time-resolution to the changes in the cladoceran source communities in order to assess the effects of production, sedimentation and taphonomic processes on the composition, completeness of time series and size structure of cladoceran remains in a large deep monomictic subalpine lake. Cladoceran remains collected in the ST globally reflected seasonal changes in the composition of the source community for the dominant taxa (Daphnia sp., Eubosmina spp. and. D. brachyurum) but failed in capturing accurately the seasonal changes in the abundance of the least abundant species, B. longirostris. Using allometric relationships, the average body size of the organisms that produced the remains retrieved in the ST could be reconstructed. Although the cladoceran average body size estimated from trap remains was always smaller than that of the source communities, temporal changes in the average body size of the dominant taxa in the source community were captured by trap samples. Our results showed that, in this deep subalpine lake, cladoceran remains production, sedimentation and taphonomic processes within the water column did not alter the compositional fidelity of remains at seasonal and annual time scales for the dominant taxa. Results did not show any significant over-representation of Bosmina and subsequent under-representation of Daphnia in contrast to previous studies on small and flat lakes. Our results suggest that the frequently observed under-estimation of Daphnia in fossil assemblages could be a consequence of the mesh size used when processing sediment core samples rather than of varying magnitude of degradation processes between small or flat lakes and deep lakes. Finally, our results support the use of the size of cladoceran remains within paleo-ecological studies to assess past changes in the size structure of the source communities.					alric, benjamin/F-5068-2019	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2011	676	1					101	116		10.1007/s10750-011-0868-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0868-0													WOS:000296739300006

These modes of reproduction can be recognized in the subfossil sedimentary records as parthenogenetic shells of females (asexual reproduction) and by ephippia (sexual reproduction). We studied the interrelations between subfossil chydorid ephippia and environmental variables by analyzing surface sediment samples obtained from 76 Finnish lakes across a latitudinal gradient (60-70 degrees N). The results showed that the total chydorid ephippia (TCE) increases along the climate gradient from similar to 2 to 3% in the south to similar to 25% in the north and suggested a significant dependence (r similar to -0.8, P < 0.001) with several climate factors, especially that of mean July air temperature. We used this relationship to create a model for reconstructing past mean July air temperatures. A linear regression of the log(10) transformed TCE as a single independent variable explained 76% (SE +/- 0.76 degrees C) of the variance of the observed mean July air temperatures. Accordingly, we propose that this novel tool may be highly suitable for reconstructing paleotemperatures in cold-temperate environments.

We studied the role of zooplankton in biomanipulation and the subsequent recovery phase in the Enonselka basin of Lake Vesijarvi, using subfossil cladocerans in annually laminated sediment. Measures to restore the Enonselka basin included reduction in external nutrient loading and mass removal of plankti- and benthivorous fish. Water clarity increased and the lake changed from a eutrophic to a mesotrophic state. However, some signs of increased turbidity were observed after 5-10 years of successful recovery. 2. Annual laminae in a freeze core sample were identified and sliced, based on the seasonal succession of diatoms. Cladoceran remains and rotifer eggs were counted, and Daphnia ephippia and Eubosmina and Bosmina ephippia and carapaces were measured. Annual changes in pelagic species composition were studied with principal component analysis. Individual species abundance, size measurements and various cladoceran-based indices or ratios (commonly used to reconstruct changes in trophic state and fish predation) were tested for change between four distinct periods: I (1985-1988) dense fish stocks, poor water quality; II (1989-1992) fish removal; III (1993-1997) low fish density, improved water quality; IV (1998-2002) slightly increased fish density and poorer water quality. 3. After the removal of fish, the mean size of Daphnia ephippia and Eubosmina crassicornis ephippia and carapaces increased significantly. In contrast, the percentage of Daphnia did not increase. When based on ephippia, the ratio Daphnia/(Daphnia + E. crassicornis) increased, but the interpretation was obscured by the tolerance of fish predation by small Daphnia and by the fact that bosminids were the preferred food of roach. Moreover, ephippial production by E. crassicornis decreased in recent years. 4. The abundance of Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Limnosida frontosa increased significantly after the fish population was reduced, while that of Ceriodaphnia and rotifers decreased. 5. The expanding littoral vegetation along with improved water clarity was clearly reflected in the concentration of littoral species in the deep sediment core. The species diversity index for the entire subfossil community also increased. 6. The period of faltering recovery was characterised by greater interannual variability and an increased percentage of rotifers. Nevertheless, the mean sizes of Daphnia ephippia and E. crassicornis ephippia and carapaces indicated a low density of fish. The deteriorating water quality was apparently related to multiple stressors in the catchment after rehabilitation, such as intensified lakeshore building, as well as to exceptional weather conditions, challenging the management methods in use.

Bdelloid rotifers (Bdelloidea, Rotifera) in shallow freshwater ecosystems of Thala Hills, East Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Shallow waters, little-studied in Continental Antarctica, among other micrometazoans host bdelloid rotifers, which diversity, ecology, and distributional patterns in turn are poorly known. To address these issues, we analysed plankton samples collected during the 2018/2019 season in the Thala Hills oasis (East Antarctica), in shallow freshwater lakes and temporary ponds that formed during intense snow melting in December-January. Bdelloids were present in more than 90% of the sites with nine species revealed. The most frequent were Antarctic endemics [Philodina gregaria (P. gregaria), Adineta grandis (A. grandis), and Adineta coatsi (A. coatsi)], while some non-abundant bdelloids either provide characteristics of widely distributed taxa or require further taxonomy studies as they can be species new for the science. The abundance of bdelloids varied greatly across studied sites and localities, with a maximum of more than 700,000 ind m(-3) and an increasing tendency to be more numerous in rock-basin temporary ponds, compared to larger lakes, with variability for different taxa. The environmental parameters strongly explain the bdelloid distribution (78.4% of the variation), with the most important factors being the type of bottom (9.9%), altitude (8.0%), TDS (6.6%), and salinity (6.5%). The cyanobacterial mats from the bottom didn't contribute much to bdelloid distributional patterns, despite being known to be a preferred habitat for micrometazoans including rotifers. These results shape a perspective to study the processes of the formation of Antarctic seasonal aquatic habitats settled by organisms, which demonstrate an ecomorphological range from planktonic organisms to crawling 'scrapers'.

Phytoplankton modelling of Lake Erken, Sweden by linking the models PROBE and PROTECH	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A phytoplankton community model (PROTECH) and a lake physical model (PROBE) were linked, for the first time, to simulate the phytoplankton community of Lake Erken (Sweden). This allowed the physical effects of ice formation to be incorporated into the calculations of PROTECH. This is the highest latitude lake simulated by PROTECH thus far and was a further test of its biological application to lake ecosystems in general. A new cyanobacteria species was added to the PROTECH model: Gloeotrichia echinulata (Smith) Richter which had functional characteristics never before simulated in PROTECH and was an order of magnitude larger than species previously simulated. The biological outputs of total chlorophyll a were successfully validated against quantitative observations from the lake (EF = 0.76). The addition of G. echinulata to the model notably improved this fit, particularly in the period from July to October. Key taxa biomass were also simulated, with good fits for diatoms (EF = 0.70) and cyanobacteria (EF = 0.83). Furthermore, the characteristic periodic blooms of Gloeotrichia were captured, thus supporting its assigned model parameters and suggesting that PROTECH's growth equations can be applied to this significantly larger species. Furthermore, it appears that Gloeotrichia's simulated seasonal pattern of growth was greatly dependent upon the water temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to assess the importance of pastoral areas to wild ungulates, we studied density and habitat choice of wild ungulates and cattle in Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda, the adjacent exclusively pastoral Nshara Dairy Ranch and on private land consisting of a mixture of ranching and subsistence farms. Transects, in the three land-use zones, were walked during the wet season and the data were analysed by DISTANCE sampling technique. We found significantly higher total density of wild ungulates on the dairy ranch compared with the National Park and private land. There was no significant difference in total wild animal density between the National Park and private land. Impala (Aepyceros melampus), zebra (Equus quagga), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) had significantly higher densities on the dairy ranch compared to the National Park. Only eland (Taurotragus oryx) density was higher in the National Park compared to private land. Wild ungulates and cattle showed a high degree of habitat overlap, generally preferring open grassland. Our study shows that high densities of wild ungulates are not necessarily associated with protected areas. Pastoral areas may be important for populations of wild herbivores during the growing season despite a pronounced presence of livestock.					; Moe, Stein/G-1507-2011	Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; 													0266-4674					NOV	2006	22		6				675	683		10.1017/S0266467406003610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467406003610													WOS:000242132900007

The plankton-size spectra revealed a typical bimodal structure in all seasons. The higher peak consisted of small-sized phytoplankton ranging from 10 to 30 mu m, while the lower peak consisted mainly of rotifers and ciliates ranging from 66 to 83 mu m. Compared with other eutrophic lakes, the size classes of the bimodal structure in Longhu Lake were relatively smaller, indicating individual miniaturization in the lake's plankton community. There was also a trough in the 90 to 370 mu m region of the size spectra, indicating a low biomass for crustacean zooplankton in the lake. The slope (b = -1.27 +/- 0.04) of the normalized size spectra was lower than that of the theoretical equilibrium state (b = -1), suggesting high energy transfer from the large phytoplankton (>30 mu m) and zooplankton (>90 mu m) to the planktivorous silver and bighead carps via filter feeding. Although the seasonal size spectra fluctuated with the water temperature (positively) and nutrients (negatively) in Longhu Lake, their patterns and coefficients of determination did not significantly vary with the seasons (R-2 = 0.98 +/- 0.01, p < 0.05), indicating the plankton community is stable in this long-term biomanipulated eutrophic lake.

J	Galarneau, E; Bidleman, TF; Blanchard, P				Galarneau, E; Bidleman, TF; Blanchard, P			Seasonality and interspecies differences in particle/gas partitioning of PAHs observed by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This study presents partitioning data from eight locations in the Laurentian Great Lakes region collected by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) over periods ranging from I to 6 years. Particle/gas partitioning varies sufficiently between sites in the Great Lakes region to preclude the use of a uniform temperature dependence for its description. Site-specific parameters for describing partitioning as a function of inverse temperature are presented. Relationships between partitioning of appreciably semivolatile PAHs and saturated vapour pressure at Chicago (IIT) and Sturgeon Point (STP) demonstrate that anthracene, benz[a]anthracene and retene behave differently than phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and chrysene + triphenylene. Possible reasons for these differences include interspecies variations in the fraction of atmospherically non-exchangeable, though analytically extractable, PAHs on particles and differences in soot-air partition coefficients as they relate to saturated vapour pressure. The observed interspecies differences are not consistent with sampling artefacts such as filter adsorption or sorbent breakthrough. At IIT, but not at STP, values of the slope of the relationship between the log partition coefficient and log vapour pressure vary in a manner opposing the annual temperature cycle. A comparison of partitioning calculated by a combined absorption/adsorption model shows good predictability at Chicago but underestimates values at a rural site (Eagle Harbor, EGH) by an order of magnitude.

They carry domestic and industrial wastewater to Van Lake. For assessment of the environmental load from these rivers to the lake, a sampling investigation from October 2019 to September 2020 was carried out. Chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and nitrogenous compound levels were also examined. Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates ranged up to 0.40 mg L-1 (Kurubas River), the mean phosphate was 0.96 mg L-1, and the mean boron 1.2 mg L-1. According to Turkish surface water quality regulations, while Morali and Akkopru Rivers were determined as class II (less contaminated), Kurubas River was found as class III (polluted).

J	Mineeva, NM				Mineeva, N. M.			Long-term dynamics of photosynthetic pigments in plankton of a large plains reservoir	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Long-term observations are necessary to analyze and predict changes occurring in biological communities under global and regional climatic changes. The data on seasonal and long-term dynamics of chlorophyll in plankton of the Rybinsk Reservoir (Upper Volga, Russia) obtained in May - October 2009-2019 at six standard stations using the fluor once method are presented. In the years with contrasting hydroclimatic conditions and water regime, the chlorophyll content varied from 1-3 to >100 mu g/L. The significant variability of mean seasonal values (7.9 +/- 10.5 mu g/L in 2009 to 27.6 +/- 1.7 mu g/L in 2013 with variation coefficients of 52-134%) indicates the low resistance of the community. The total chlorophyll content is associated with the development of three main phytoplankton divisions i.e., diatoms, cyanopmkaryots, and green algae. The trophic status of the reservoir was characterized as mesotrophic in 2009 and 2017, eutrophic in 2011-2014, and moderately eutrophic in other years. In the long-term seasonal cycle of phytoplankton. there are five periods with stable temperature conditions and transparency, but variable chlorophyll contort. A coo date positive relationship was found between the seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll and water temperature, but a moderate negative relationship with transparency. The priority factors regulating the long-term dynamics of chlorophyll include the NAO indices, Wolf numbers, temperature, and underwater light conditions, as well as the inflow volume and water level. Water regime limits the development of phytoplankton.

This fly species uses a combination of olfactory and visual cues to locate its hosts. Previously, traps and targets baited with visual cues have been used in vector control, but the development of olfactory based tools has been challenging. Recently, repellents have shown promise as olfactory-based tools in tsetse vector control. Here, we evaluated a three-component blend comprising 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetophenone and geranyl acetone (blend K), previously identified as a repellent for savannah tsetse flies in zebra skin odor, on G. f. fuscipes populations. Using a series of 6 x 6 randomized Latin square-designed experiments, G. f. fuscipes catches in biconical traps were monitored on four islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya between July and September 2019, after the long rainy season. Traps were baited with blend K and individual components of this blend. The known tsetse repellent blend WRC (waterbuck repellent compounds) and trap alone were included as controls. Daily catch data in thirty-six replicate trials were analyzed using generalized linear model with negative binomial error structure using the package "MASS" in R. Treatment, day and site were set as predictor variables. Our results showed that, blend K significantly reduced G. f. fuscipes catches by 25.6% (P < 0.01) compared to the control trap alone but was not significantly different from WRC which reduced catches by 20.7% (P < 0.05). Of the individual compounds, geranyl acetone solely significantly reduced catches by 29.1% (P < 0.01) which did not differ from blend K or WRC. We conclude that geranyl acetone accounts for the repellent effect of blend K on the riverine tsetse fly, G. f. fuscipes, demonstrating the ecological importance of animal skin odors in the host seeking behavior of medically-important tsetse fly vectors.

J	Özdemir, K				Ozdemir, Kadir			INVESTIGATION OF TRIHALOMETHANE FORMATION AFTER CHLORINE DIOXIDE PREOXIDATION FOLLOWED BY CHLORINATION OF NATURAL ORGANIC MATTER	ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING												Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is widely used as powerful oxidant to remove taste, odor and pathogenic microorganisms with chlorine during water treatment. In this study, the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) was investigated in sequential ClO2 and chlorination processes. During the study, water samples were collected from Terkos Lake water (TLW) and Btiytikyekmece Lake water (BLW) in Istanbul. To understand the relationship between the formation of THMs and the characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM), changes in the molecular weight (MW) of NOM fractions before and after ClO2 oxidation were characterized with the ultrafiltration technique. The NOM fraction with MW <1 kDa is the dominant fraction among all the fractionated water samples. ClO2 oxidized NOM to more hydrophilic and smaller organic fractions as seen in the NOM fraction with MWCO <1 kDa. ClO2 preoxidation reduced THM concentrations but produced chlorite (ClO2-) and chlorate (ClO3-). The increase in ClO2 doses enhanced the reduction percentages of THMs during subsequent chlorination in water samples without or with bromide application. Bromine incorporation was higher in ClO2 preoxidized TLW and BLW samples. As a result, the findings of this study demonstrated that ClO2 preoxidation prior to chlorination is an applicable strategy for control of THMs in water treatment.																			0324-8828						2021	47	2					125	137		10.37190/epe210209	http://dx.doi.org/10.37190/epe210209													WOS:000667180400009

However, it is not clear how China's inland waters have responded to climate change in the past using a consistent method on a national scale. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2015 to study the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water surface temperature in China using the wavelet transform method. The results showed the following: 1) the freezing date of China inland water has shown a significant delaying trend during the past 16 years with an average rate of -1.5 days yr(-1); 2) the shift of the 0 degrees C isotherm position of surface water across China has clear seasonal changes, which first moved eastward about 25 degrees and northward about 15 degrees, and then gradually moved back after the year 2009; 3) during the past 16 years, the 0 degrees C isotherm of China's surface water has gradually moved north by about 0.09 degrees in the latitude direction and east by about 1 degrees in the longitude direction; and 4) the interannual variation of water surface temperature in 17 lakes of China showed a similar fluctuation trend that increased before 2010, and then decreased. The El Nino and La Nina around 2010 could have impacts on the turning point of the annual variation of water surface temperature. This study validated the response of China's inland surface water to global climate change and improved the understanding of the wetland environment's response to climate change.

Hydrogeochemical characterization of small coastal wetlands and forests in the Southern Po plain (Northern Italy)	ECOHYDROLOGY												This study is aimed to characterize the shallow groundwater system in the coastal area between the Uniti and Bevano rivers ( southern part of the Po plain), where salinization is threatening the coastal ecosystems and posing a major environmental issue for the phreatic water management in the coast. A thin rainwater lens is present at the top of the aquifer in the backshore area and its extent has a seasonal variability. These few centimetres of freshwater represent a thin interface between sea water and the delicate coastal ecosystems, such as those of dunes and wetlands. To have a better understanding of the changes in groundwater chemistry, we performed a seasonal monitoring of the water quality at the top of the aquifer. Effective concentrations of chemicals and actual values of physical-chemical parameters in the rainwater lens could be measured by means of auger holes. The analysis of the cation-exchange process in the aquifer was made through the application of the Base Exchange index (BEX index) of Stuyfzand (2008), an indicator of salinization or freshening of waters. The results pointed out that a salinization process is taking place in the largest part of the aquifer. Extension and chemical composition of the rainwater lens are strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as drainage and land use. The surface water bodies are all brackish to salty and characterized by anoxic and reducing conditions. At present, only halophytes are present around the dune slacks, which have turned into brackish to hypersaline lakes (C) Copyright. 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Mapping bottom substrate in Illinois waters of Lake Michigan: Linking substrate and biology	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Habitat plays an essential role in shaping aquatic communities yet limited information on the type and distribution of bottom features is available in the form of detailed maps. This is especially apparent in large systems where obtaining such information can be both expensive and challenging. Current maps of Lake Michigan substrate are very general and lack suitable detail of substrate composition and geographic extent of rocky areas. This limits our ability to link biological processes, such as fish spawning, to nearshore habitat and makes it difficult to target structurally complex habitats for sampling. We compiled substrate information gathered over 72 years for Illinois waters and incorporated it into a GIS framework to generate more complete documentation of sediment type and particle size distribution in southwestern Lake Michigan. Sediment data for 1682 sites were standardized to phi units; natural neighbor interpolation was used during GIS analysis to predict sediment type in areas lacking data. Predicted sediment values based on this interpolation had a significant positive relationship with observed sediment values (R-2=0.92). Further, we linked existing fishery (yellow perch Perca flavescens) data with newly generated substrate information to identify potential associations between spawning site selection and habitat. Tagging data indicated that substrate quality affected the likelihood of yellow perch returning to their release sites in subsequent spawning seasons; higher fidelity was associated with larger, coarser substrate. The generated map will be a useful tool to enhance our understanding of habitat's importance in the Great Lakes, particularly when linked with fishery data.

The water samples were collected monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 at two sites distantly located in Meiliang Bay and Lake Center, which differed strongly in their trophic status and sediment resuspension. The microbial eukaryotic community compositions (MECC) were measured using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene fragments. Seasonal variations were related to environmental factors by means of redundancy analysis (RDA) in order to reveal the most important regulating factors. At both sites, the structures and Shannon-Wiener indices of the microbial eukaryotic communities displayed apparent seasonal variations, which were significantly related to environmental variables. There were significant intrahabitat differences in environmental factors regulating MECC, as well as in the seasonal dynamics of the two sites during the study period. At Meiliang Bay, the variations of total phosphorus concentration and cladocera abundance had the most profound impacts on the microbial eukaryotic community composition, while at Lake Center, the total nitrogen concentration and conductivity were most influential. Our results suggest that the DGGE method is a cost-effective way to analyze the seasonal dynamics of MECC and their interaction with environmental variables, which will provide new insights into the diversity and dynamics of MECC.

Influences of Multi-Scale Habitat on Metabolism in a Coastal Great Lakes Watershed	ECOSYSTEMS												Spatial heterogeneity influences ecosystem structure and function across multiple habitat scales. Although primary production and respiration are fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates: sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales; greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.

J	Tolotti, M; Boscaini, A; Salmaso, N				Tolotti, Monica; Boscaini, Adriano; Salmaso, Nico			Comparative analysis of phytoplankton patterns in two modified lakes with contrasting hydrological features	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Hydrological management represents one of the main factors controlling physical and chemical characteristics as well as biodiversity and productivity of planktonic communities in artificial and modified lakes. In Alpine piedmont reservoirs, which often receive large water inputs from high altitude watersheds, control operated by hydrological regime over ecological processes is also mediated by other related variables such as water temperature and turbulence, and load of inorganic suspended solids. This contribution reports on results obtained from a comparative study on the impact of hydrological regime on phytoplankton patterns in two modified piedmont lakes of different size and hydrology located in the NE Italian Alps: Lake Santa Croce (V = 147 x 10(6) km(3)) and Lake Toblino (V = 5.7 x 10(6) km(3)). Phytoplankton of both lakes was characterised by a pronounced dominance of diatoms, accompanied by cryptophytes and green algae. The mesotrophic Lake Santa Croce showed a typical seasonal succession of dominant groups, while phytoplankton growth in the eutrophic Lake Toblino was variable and showed pronounced pulses in relation to dramatic changes in the hydrological regime. The comparative study of phytoplankton, based on morpho-functional classification and application of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling, principal components analysis, and redundancy analysis), showed that hydrological regime affected phytoplankton growth in the two lakes both directly, i.e. through renewal time, and indirectly, i.e. regulating thermal conditions in Lake Santa Croce and nutrient availability in both lakes. Nevertheless, effectiveness of hydrological constraints largely depended on lake size and morphology, being more pronounced in the shallower and smaller Lake Toblino.

J	Stevens, LR; Stone, JR; Campbell, J; Fritz, SC				Stevens, LR; Stone, JR; Campbell, J; Fritz, SC			A 2200-yr record of hydrologic variability from Foy Lake, Montana, USA, inferred from diatom and geochemical data	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A 2200-yr long, high-resolution (similar to 5 yr) record of drought variability in northwest Montana is inferred from diatoms and delta(18)O values of bioinduced carbonate preserved in a varved lacustrine core from Foy Lake. A previously developed model of the diatom response to lake-level fluctuations is used to constrain estimates of paleolake levels derived from the diatom data. High-frequency (decadal) fluctuations in the detrended delta(18)O record mirror variations in wet/dry cycles inferred from Banff tree-rings, demonstrating the sensitivity of the oxygen-isotope values to changes in regional moisture balance. Low frequency (multi-centennial) isotopic changes may be associated with shifts in the seasonal distribution of precipitation. From 200 B.C. to A.D. 800, both diatom and isotope records indicate that climate was dry and lake level low. with poor diatom preservation and high organic carbon: nitrogen ratios. Subsequently, lake level rose slightly, although the climate was drier and more stable than modern conditions. At A.D. 1200, lake level increased to approximately 6 m below present elevation, after which the lake fluctuated between this elevation and full stage, with particularly cool and/or wetter conditions after 1700. The hydrologic balance of the lake shifted abruptly at 1894 because of the establishment of a lumber mill at the lake's outlet. Spectral analysis of the delta(18)O data indicates that severe droughts occurred with multi-decadal (50 to 70 yr) frequency. (c) 2005 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

Phillip; Tanzy, Brent F.; Solis, Juan			Assessment of the crop coefficient for saltgrass under native riparian field conditions in the desert southwest	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Limited urban water supplies in southwestern USA cause water managers and planners to re-assess water losses and needs from consumptive water use by riparian vegetation. Here, we report on field measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) for inland saltgrass [Distichlis spicata var. stricta (L.) Greene]; a once common riparian plant native to the desert southwest. The objective was to develop a saltgrass crop coefficient, Kc, similar to agricultural crop coefficients commonly used in irrigation water management. The developed Kc, in conjunction with the local climate, can then be used to assess the water savings that may be achieved in riparian zones for saltgrass versus invasive species and for use in irrigation management and scheduling of saltgrass in urban setting. The ET of saltgrass was measured in its native riparian setting located in the flood plain of the Rio Grande, north of Caballo Lake, New Mexico, in 2011 using an eddy covariance technique in the energy budget method. Total ET of 692 mm was measured during the growing season (n = 241 days) and 837 mm during the year. The American Society of Civil Engineers standardized ET for short crop (ETso) was calculated using climate data measured at the study site as 1560 mm during the growing season and 1870 mm during the year. Crop coefficients (ET/ETso) were fitted with a polynomial equation as a function of day of the year to develop saltgrass Kc function. A graphical and simplified method of computing Kc as a function of day of the year and crop season was also developed as an alternative method.

Disentangling PQ from NPQ allows using SIF estimates in various applications in aquatic optics. However, obtaining OF is challenging due to its high temporal and physiological variability, and the combined measurements needed to enclose all relevant optical paths. In inland waters, this type of data is scarce and information on diurnal and seasonal OF dynamics are almost unknown. Using an autonomous hyperspectral Thetis profiler in Lake Geneva, we demonstrate how to estimate OF using an ensemble of in-situ measurements acquired between 2018 to 2021. We use vertical and temporal changes in retrieved OF to determine NPQ and PQ conditions. We observed NPQ in 36% of the total daytime profiles used in the OF analysis. While downwelling irradiance is a significant contributor to OF, its role cannot be easily interpreted. Other factors such as phytoplankton photoregulation and assemblages also likely play significant roles in quenching mechanisms. We conclude that an adapted approach exploiting in-situ data is suitable to determine diurnal and seasonal NPQ occurrence, and helps develop future remote sensing algorithms.

Control rule performance for intermixing lake whitefish populations in the 1836 Treaty waters of the Great Lakes: A simulation-based evaluation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We conducted a simulation-based evaluation exploring the effects of population intermixing on the current 65% total annual mortality control rule used to manage lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) fisheries in the 1836 Treaty waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The simulations incorporated intermixing among four populations with characteristics similar to those of lake whitefish in northern lakes Huron and Michigan. Dynamics of each population were simulated for 100 years with each stock exploited by a single fishery. An age-structured assessment of each stock was conducted every third year, with the abundance, mortality, and recruitment estimates used with the current control rule to set future harvest limits. Overall aggregate yield of the modeled system was generally not affected by intermixing, but did depend on assumed productivity levels. Mean annual yields for individual fisheries were sensitive to mixing levels, with yields from fisheries coinciding with low productivity spawning populations often similar to those coinciding with high productivity populations when intermixing occurred. Variability in yield tended to decrease slightly as mixing rates increased. Intermixing did not have a large influence on measures of spawning population sustainability, but detection of declining population sizes in low productivity populations may be difficult when intermixing occurs because of fishery yields remaining high due to immigration of fish from other spawning areas. This raises concern about the current control rule given that low productivity populations had spawning population sizes less than 20% of the unfished level in most years.

J	Propastin, P				Propastin, Pavel			Multisensor Monitoring System for Assessment of Locust Hazard Risk in the Lake Balkhash Drainage Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Satellite and ground-based data were combined in a monitoring system to quantify the link between climate conditions and the risk of locust infestations in the southern part of Lake Balkhash's drainage basin in the Republic of Kazakhstan. In this monitoring system, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from the SPOT-VGT satellite, was used for mapping potential locust habitats and monitoring their area throughout 1998 to 2007. TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason 1 altimeter data were used to track the interannual dynamics of water level in Balkhash Lake. Climate conditions were represented by weather records for air temperature and precipitation during the same period. The classification procedure, based on an analysis of multitemporal dynamics of SPOT-VGT NDVI values observed by individual vegetation classes, generated annual areas of ten land-cover types, which were then categorized as areas with low, medium, and high risk for locust infestation. Statistical analyses showed significant influences of the climatic parameters and the Balkhash Lake hydrological regime on the spatial extend of annual areas of potential locust habitats. The results also indicate that the linkages between locust infestation risk and environmental factors are characterized by time lags. The expansion of locust risk areas are usually preceded by dry, hot years and lower water levels in Balkhash Lake when larger areas of reed grass are free from seasonal flooding. Years with such conditions are favourable for locust outbreaks due to expansion of the habitat areas suitable for locust oviposition and nymphal development. In contrast, years with higher water levels in Balkhash Lake and lower temperature decrease the potential locust habitat area.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2012	50	6					1234	1246		10.1007/s00267-012-9950-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9950-2								22990684					WOS:000311292800021

BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												The Hooded Grebe Podiceps gallardoi has been uplisted to globally 'Endangered' recently mainly because of the rapid population decline suffered within the last 20 years due to factors such as nest depredation by Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus as well as destruction of colonies by wind and lake desiccation. During a census of Hooded Grebes during the 2010/2011 breeding season we found a new predator that has not previously been mentioned, the American mink Neovison vison. One individual mink killed 33 Hooded Grebes and consequently destroyed one of the five colonies found in that breeding season. Due to the characteristics of the waterbird assemblage in the area, the impact of mink could be catastrophic.

OP and OC co-exist in various forms in the environment, thus a thorough investigation on the impact of OC fractions on the release of OP in sediments should be comprehensively carried out. This study determined the chemical forms of OP and OC in the sediments over four seasons in Lake Taihu and found temporal and spatial variations in their concentrations. The concentration of total OP and total OC ranged from 133 to 348 mg/kg and 4.77 to 21.19 mg/kg, respectively. Correlation between chemical fractions of OP and OC also revealed that NaOH-extracted OP, and fulvic acid-bound and humic acid-bound OP were positively correlated with humic-OC and hot hydrolysis-OC. These results suggest that the algal-derived OC degradation and mineralization may enhance OP mineralization, converting stable or moderately active OP into active forms or inorganic phosphorus under cyanobacterial bloom. This study provides insight and guiding support for investigating the impact of organic matter components on the transformation of OP after cyanobacterial degradation in eutrophic lakes.

Active and passive sampling methods for grubs of the Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera formosae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), in a corn-soybean rotation	CROP PROTECTION												Beginning in the mid-2000s, grubs of the Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera formosae (Brenske) (syn. M. castanea [Arrow]), emerged as significant early-season pests of field corn grown in sandy soils of the Great Lakes region. Overwintered grubs move towards the soil surface in springtime to resume feeding on roots, causing stand losses of up to 40%. Scouting for M. formosae is problematic as the grubs are subterranean, and the adults are nocturnal. The objective of this study was to evaluate sampling methods currently in use for other annual white grub species specifically for use with M. formosae grubs in corn production systems. In a series of two experiments, we evaluated the ability of the compact cutter, golf hole cup cutter, and wire-mesh bait station to detect M. formosae grubs and sense varying population densities. The cup cutter, which takes a deeper but smaller soil volume sample than the compact cutter, sampled more grubs per soil volume and was more sensitive to smaller grub populations. The bait station, a passive sampling technique, and cup cutter were both successful at detecting M. formosae before planting. However, the cup cutter is more adequate and economical since it can be used with less equipment in a single trip to the field. Identification of a standardized sampling methods will enable re-searchers to predict future infestations and ultimately lead to the development of economic threshold levels for M. formosae in row crop agroecosystems.

However, global warming and increased glacier meltwater have turned some foreland meadows into swamp meadows. The potential impact of this change on the function of foreland soils in methane consumption remains unclear. Therefore, we collected Tibetan glacier foreland soils in the non-melting season from typical microtopography in swamp meadows (hummock and hollow). Three soil moisture conditions (moist, saturated, and submerged) were set by adding glacier runoff water. Soil samples were then incubated in the laboratory for two weeks at 10 center dot C and 20 center dot C. About 5 % of 13CH4/12CH4 was added to the incubation bottles, and daily methane concentrations were measured. DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) and highthroughput sequencing were combined to target the active methanotroph populations. The results showed that type Ia methanotrophs, including Crenothrix, Methylobacter, and an unclassified Methylomonadaceae cluster, actively oxidized methane at 10 center dot C and 20 center dot C. There were distinct responses of methanotrophs to soil moisture rises in hummock and hollow soils, resulting in different methane oxidation potentials. In both hummock and hollow soils, the methane oxidation potential was positively correlated with temperature. Furthermore, saturated hummock soils exhibited the highest methane oxidation potential and methanotroph populations, while submerged hollow soils had the lowest. This suggests that the in-situ hummock soils, generally saturated with water, are more essential than in-situ hollows, typically submerged in water, for alleviating the global warming potential of swamp meadows in the Tibetan glacier foreland during the growing season.					; Xing, Peng/E-9238-2016; liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024	Hernandez, Marcela/0000-0002-1041-785X; Xing, Peng/0000-0002-4917-5181													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 1	2023	862								160888	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160888		DEC 2022						36521618					WOS:000989508500001

Geoffrey; Denton, Marianne			Harvesting an invasive bivalve in a large natural lake: species recovery and impacts on native benthic macroinvertebrate community structure in Lake Tahoe, USA	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												The increasing dispersal and establishment of aquatic invasive species in natural freshwater ecosystems has led to efforts to remove non-native taxa and/or restore native species. An invasive bivalve, Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), recently (2002) became established in a large, natural subalpine lake (Lake Tahoe, USA). In 2009, experimental efforts were undertaken to harvest C. fluminea from Lake Tahoe sediments using a manually operated suction dredge apparatus. Treatment and control plots were monitored for a 450?day period after dredging to observe target species (C. fluminea) and non-target macroinvertebrate recovery rates. A paired Before-After-Control Impact analysis was used to assess the short- and long-term impacts of suction dredging. Physical harvest resulted in short-term reductions of C. fluminea (1500 individuals m-2 before treatment to 60 individuals m-2 14?days after treatment) with significant disruption to benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. The impact to the target invasive species (C. fluminea) was present 450?days after treatment and community diversity (as represented by Simpson diversity index) did not recover after 1?year (365?days) in dredged sites. Certain non-target macroinvertebrate taxa (Chironomidae and native clam (Pisidium spp.)) increased in suction dredge plots to levels greater than before treatment or in control plot conditions at the end of the study period. Harvesting C. fluminea significantly reduced population densities for a period of 450?days after the removal. Recolonization rates of C. fluminea and non-target species over multiple reproductive seasons will determine the feasibility for this method as a long-term control strategy.

Impact of harvesting and logging slash on nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soils from upland spruce forests in northeastern Ontario	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The potential impact of timber harvesting in the boreal forest on aquatic ecosystem water quality and productivity depends in part on the production of nutrients within the soil of the harvested catchment. Nitrogen supplied by organic matter decomposition is of particular interest because of the important role that N plays in biotic processes in surface waters, and in forest nutrition in general. Logging slash quality and input to the forest floor has the potential to influence N availability after harvest on clearcut sites. Net production of organic and inorganic-N and microbial biomass C and N concentrations were determined during a 90-day laboratory incubation at constant temperature and moisture. Incubated soils included F horizon and shallow mineral soil horizons (0-5 cm) from unharvested and full-tree harvested (2 and 12 growing seasons since harvest) boreal forest sites at the Esker Lakes Research Area (ELRA), in northeastern Ontario, Canada. In an ancillary experiment, black spruce foliage was added to unharvested forest floor material after 30 days during a 90-day laboratory incubation to simulate the influence of logging slash from full-tree harvesting on C and N dynamics. Twelve-year old clearcut F horizon material released on average 75 and 5 times more NO3--N and 3 and 2 times as much inorganic-N than soil collected from unharvested and 2-year-old clearcuts, respectively. This increase in NO3- -N accumulation during the incubation was accompanied by decreases in both exchangeable NH4+-N and microbial biomass C and N levels. Net daily changes in microbial biomass N were significantly related to organic and inorganic-N accumulation or loss within the F horizon. Mineral soil release of inorganic-N was lower than release from the forest floor. Nitrate-nitrogen accumulation was lower, and NH4+-N accumulation was higher in mineral soil from unharvested sites when compared to 12-year-old clearcuts. Calculated harvest response ratios indicated that incubated mineral soil from the 12-year-old clearcut sites released significantly greater amounts of NO3 -N than 2-year-old clearcuts. Incorporation of black spruce needles into F horizon material reduced the production of organic and inorganic-N and increased microbial biomass N. Laboratory incubations of F horizon and shallow mineral soil from 12-year-old clearcuts suggested that these boreal soils have the capacity for increased inorganic-N production compared to uncut stands several years after harvesting. This has the potential to increase N availability to growing boreal forest plantations and increase N leaching due to greater NO3- -N levels in the forest soil. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of a cascade of reservoirs and seasonal variation in the phytoplankton structure in a tropical river	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												This study aims to analyse the influence of a cascade of reservoirs on the density, richness and functional groups of phytoplankton in the Contas River, a tropical river of Brazil. This river has two dams along its course, forming the Pedra and Funil reservoirs. Samples were collected over three consecutive years (Dec., 2007 to Dec., 2010) at 28 sampling stations along the river. We identified 198 species and the stretches downstream from the reservoirs showed greater richness. Chlorophyceae, followed by Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae were the dominant groups and highest density was recorded during the rainy season. Overall, a longitudinal pattern in algal densities was found for both seasons, with the lowest values recorded in sections of the Pedra and Funil reservoirs and the highest densities in the downstream sections. Nine functional groups were identified (C, F, J, MP, S1, Sn, Td, Y, Ws); of these, F and J grouped the species with the highest relative abundance during the dry season, while the S1 group, represented by the cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii, was dominant in the rainy season. The present study showed a high longitudinal variation in the phytoplankton richness and density, attributed to the hydrological change between the lotic and lentic stretches. Furthermore, the effects of the cascade of reservoirs on phytoplankton, such as reduced density, increased richness and changes in algal associations, were strongly influenced by habitat heterogeneity found in this environment, as well as the rainfall in the region.

Bioenergetics Evaluation of the Fish Community in the Western Arm of Lake Superior in 2004	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Lake Superior's fish community continues to change as a result of the recovery of populations of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, the naturalization of introduced salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. and Salmo spp., declines in the Populations of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, and the fluctuating recruitment of cisco Coregonus artedi. This study used bioenergetics modeling of the dominant predator fish in the western arm of Lake Superior in 2004 to provide a comprehensive picture of the relationship between predator demand and prey fish availability. The results, presented for nearshore and offshore areas and three geographically distinct ecoregions, indicate that the western ann is at or near its carrying capacity for predators Estimated predator demand was about one-half the annual biomass plus production of coregonines but exceeded the biomass plus production of rainbow smelt, possibly because of underestimates of this species in shallow areas and recent shifts in predator diets. Lean lake trout were responsible for most of the consumption of these prey fish, while the deepwater siscowet form ranked second. The commercial harvest of prey fish biomass was trivial compared with the consumption by predator fish. Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, along with other nearshore potamodromous species, played minor roles in total consumption. Chinook salmon are an indicator of forage status, as they have responded to declines in the rainbow smelt biomass with a dramatic diet shift to ciscoes and a decline in weight at age since the early 1990s. Slightly reduced lean lake trout growth and density-dependent survival in some areas also indicate that competition for prey is intense. Because most of the predators in the western arm are wild fish, stocked predators no longer have a great impact on prey populations. Bioenergetics modeling of predator demand combined with hydroacoustic estimates of prey Supply can be valuable for managing the fisheries of large takes, allocating resources to various interest groups, and increasing basic understanding of lake production and community dynamics.																			0275-5947					DEC	2008	28	6					1649	1667		10.1577/M07-176.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M07-176.1													WOS:000268504700001

A total of 11 phenolic compounds including nonylphenol, t-octylphenol (t-OP) and bisphenol A (BPA) were measured in February, June and October 2002. NP is the most abundant chemical among the phenolic compounds and its concentrations in dissolved water, particulates and surface sediments from Shihwa Lake were measured as 17.4-1533.1 ng/l, 4.3-831.2 ng/l and 10.4-5054.1 ng/g dw, respectively. NP concentration in dissolved water varied with seasons and generally showed a decreasing order of June > October > February, while the seasonal trend was hardly found in sediment. High levels of NP were measured in surrounding industrial complexes, the concentrations was decreased gradually with distance from the industrial areas. NP in core samples showed an increasing trend toward the core depth. There exists a reasonable correlation between NP in dissolved water and in particulates, whereas the correlation between NP in dissolved water and in sediments is not significant. AN concentrations in Shihwa Lake were comparable to other highly polluted areas of the world and their possible effects on various organisms in the lake are discussed.

J	Pavloudi, C; Zafeiropoulos, H				Pavloudi, Christina; Zafeiropoulos, Haris			Deciphering the community structure and the functional potential of a hypersaline marsh microbial mat community	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Microbial mats are vertically stratified communities of microorganisms characterized by pronounced physiochemical gradients allowing for high species diversity and a wide range of metabolic capabilities. High Throughput Sequencing has the potential to reveal the biodiversity and function of such ecosystems in the cycling of elements. The present study combines 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics on a hypersaline marsh in Tristomo bay (Karpathos, Greece). Samples were collected in July 2018 and November 2019 from microbial mats, deeper sediment, aggregates observed in the water overlying the sediment, as well as sediment samples with no apparent layering. Metagenomic samples' coassembly and binning revealed 250 bacterial and 39 archaeal metagenome-assembled genomes, with completeness estimates higher than 70% and contamination less than 5%. All MAGs had KEGG Orthology terms related to osmoadaptation, with the 'salt in' strategy ones being prominent. Halobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant taxa in the mats. Photosynthesis was most likely performed by purple sulphur and nonsulphur bacteria. All samples had the capacity for sulphate reduction, dissimilatory arsenic reduction, and conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Overall, both sequencing methodologies resulted in similar taxonomic compositions and revealed that the formation of the microbial mat in this marsh exhibits seasonal variation. This study investigates the taxa and the metabolic processes that potentially occur in a hypersaline marsh microbial mat showing the layered structure of microbial communities and the role of key-processes that support life in this extreme environment.

These techniques have not been widely applied to lakes in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes, including Southern Ocean Islands (SOIs) experiencing rapid, significant shifts in climate. Historical work has highlighted the localised nature of geochemical drivers in controlling the hydrochemical evolution of lakes, such as geology, sea spray contribution, vegetation, geographical location, and ice cover extent. The role of groundwater in lake hydrology and hydrochemistry has not been identified until now, and its omission will have major implications for interpreting soil-water-air processes affecting lakes. Here we present the first comprehensive, island-wide hydrochemical and isotopic survey of lakes on a SOI. Forty lakes were examined across Macquarie Island, using comparable methods to identify key environmental processes and their geochemical drivers. Methods include stable carbon (delta C-13(DOC): dissolved organic carbon and delta C-13(DIC): dissolved inorganic carbon), oxygen (delta O-18), hydrogen (delta H-2) and strontium isotopic ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) in water. These provide essential baseline data for hydrological, biological, and geochemical lake processes. Lakes on the western side of the island are influenced by sea spray aerosols. In general, it was found that lakes at higher elevations are dilute and those located in lower elevation catchments have experienced more water-rock interactions. The hydrochemical and isotopic tracers suggest that lakes in lower elevations contain more terrestrial sourced ions that may be contributed from groundwater. Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns predicted for the region will lead to shifts in nutrient cycles, and impact the island's unique ecosystems. Future research will focus on long-term monitoring to understand seasonal, annual, and long-term variability to test fundamental hypotheses concerning ecosystem function and the consequences of environmental change on SOIs.

J	Ose, GA; Hogsette, JA				Ose, Gregory A.; Hogsette, Jerome A.			Spatial Distribution, Seasonality and Trap Preference of Stable Fly, Stomoxys Calcitrans L. (Diptera: Muscidae), Adults on a 12-Hectare Zoological Park	ZOO BIOLOGY												Although this study was originally designed to compare the efficacy of two different stable fly traps within 10 sites at a 12-ha zoological park, seasonal and spatial population distribution data were simultaneously collected. The two traps included an Alsynite fiberglass cylindrical trap (AFT) and a blue-black cloth target modified into a cylindrical trap (BCT). Both traps were covered with sticky sleeves to retain the attracted flies. Paired trap types were placed at sites that were 20-100 m apart. Distance between trap pairs within sites ranged from 1 to 2 m, and was limited by exhibit design and geography. Both trap types reflect/refract ultraviolet (UV) light which attracts adult S. calcitrans. During this 15-week study, AFTs captured significantly more stable flies than the BCTs at 8 of the 10 sites. Of the 12,557 stable flies found on the traps, 80% and 20% were captured by AFTs and BCTs, respectively. The most attractive trap site at the zoo was at the goat exhibit where most stable flies were consistently captured throughout the study. This exhibit was 100m from the other exhibits, next to a small lake, and adjacent to a field containing pastured exotic ungulates, rhea and ostrich. Stable fly populations peaked in early June then slowly decreased as the last trapping date approached. We believe this to be the first seasonality data collected at a zoological park. Results demonstrate the use of urban zoos by stable flies and the need to develop environmentally friendly stable fly management systems for zoos. Published 2014.

It is polluted by domestic wastewaters together with natural contamination and pesticides, which have had cumulatively negative effects. This study analyzes the effects of pollution by using the fish species, Capoeta umbla as a sentinel species, with a biomarker approach. The approach comprehends a general biomarker of individual fish health, the condition factor and specific biomarkers of contaminant exposure such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The general water physico-chemical parameters were measured at each sampling sites during each fish-sampling period. Strong seasonal and locational variations were observed among selected markers. In conclusion, the multibiomarker approach used in the present study clearly revealed differences in the fish health among reference and potentially contaminated sites. The study shows that changes of biomarkers such as acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P450 1A1 might be useful for the assessment of environmental contamination in the Uzuncayir Dam Lake (Tunceli, Turkey).

J	Zhang, X; Yan, QY; Yu, YH; Dai, LL				Zhang Xiang; Yan Qingyun; Yu Yuhe; Dai Lili			Spatiotemporal pattern of bacterioplankton in Donghu Lake	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Bacterioplankton play key roles in the biogeochemical cycle and in organic contaminant degradation. The species richness and abundance of bacterial subgroups are generally distinct from each other, and this is attributed to their different functions in aquatic ecosystems. The spatiotemporal variations of eight phylogenetic subgroups (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria) derived from Donghu Lake were investigated using PCR-DGGE fingerprinting, to explore their responses to environmental factors. Results indicate that Actinobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria were the two largest bacterial subgroups detected. These two groups and Bacteroidetes showed clear seasonal patterns in composition of the operational taxonomic unit. Results also suggest that the bacterioplankton subgroups in Donghu Lake were significantly correlated with different environmental factors. In brief, the total nitrogen was one of the major factors regulating all the bacterioplankton except for Actinobacteria. However, total phosphorus, another important eutrophication factor, contributed to the two largest bacterial groups (Actinobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria), as well as to the Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. Therefore, the responses of bacterioplankton subgroups to environmental factors were different, and this should be attributed to the differences in the functions of different groups.					; Dai, Lili/IVH-2359-2023	Yan, Qingyun/0000-0003-0053-892X; 													0254-4059	1993-5005				MAY	2014	32	3					554	564		10.1007/s00343-014-3037-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3037-2													WOS:000335767800009
J	Lindström, ES; Bergström, AK				Lindström, ES; Bergström, AK			Influence of inlet bacteria on bacterioplankton assemblage composition in lakes of different hydraulic retention time	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The influence of inlet bacteria on the assemblage composition of bacterioplankton was investigated in two Swedish forest lakes of different hydraulic retention time. Assemblage composition of the bacteria in lakes and running waters was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rDNA. The amount of bacterial cells imported via the inlets in relation to bacterioplankton cells produced in the epilimnion of the lakes was also determined. In the lake with short retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 0.3 yr) the lake bacterioplankton assemblage largely resembled the riverine assemblages, although the extent of similarity varied among inlets, depending on water flow. In the lake with long retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 10 yr) the bacterioplankton assemblage in the lake had low similarity to the inlet assemblages. The degree of similarity between inlets and lakes was well correlated to the amount of imported cells. Thus, our data suggest that import of inlet bacteria could have a large effect on the composition of lake bacterioplankton assemblages and that hydrological factors determined the magnitude of this effect. Since short hydraulic retention times are very common in lakes in the boreal zone, input of allochthonous bacteria can be one major factor influencing bacterioplankton assemblage composition in boreal lakes.

J	Shechner, M; Guenther, A; Rhew, R; Wishkerman, A; Li, Q; Blake, D; Lerner, G; Tas, E				Shechner, Moshe; Guenther, Alex; Rhew, Robert; Wishkerman, Asher; Li, Qian; Blake, Donald; Lerner, Gil; Tas, Eran			Emission of volatile halogenated organic compounds over various Dead Sea landscapes	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Volatile halogenated organic compounds (VHOCs), such as methyl halides (CH3X; X is Br, Cl and I) and very short-lived halogenated substances (VSLSs; bromoform - CHBr3, dibromomethane - CH2Br2, bromodichloromethane - CHBrCl2, trichloroethylene - C2HCl3, chloroform - CHCl3 - and dibromochloromethane - CHBr2Cl) are well known for their significant influence on ozone concentrations and oxidation capacity of the troposphere and stratosphere and for their key role in aerosol formation. Insufficient characterization of the sources and the emission rate of VHOCs limits our ability to understand and assess their impact in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Over the last two decades, several natural terrestrial sources for VHOCs, including soil and vegetation, have been identified, but our knowledge of emission rates from these sources and their responses to changes in ambient conditions remains limited. Here we report measurements of the mixing ratios and fluxes of several chlorinated and brominated VHOCs from different landscapes and natural and agricultural vegetated sites at the Dead Sea during different seasons. Fluxes were generally positive (emission into the atmosphere), corresponding to elevated mixing ratios, but were highly variable. Fluxes (and mixing ratios) for the investigated VHOCs ranged as follows: CHBr3 from -79 to 187 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (1.9 to 22.6 pptv), CH2Br2 from -55 to 71 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (0.7 to 19 pptv), CHBr2Cl from -408 to 768 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (0.4 to 11 pptv), CHBrCl2 from -29 to 45 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (0.5 to 9.6 pptv), CHCl3 from -577 to 883 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (15 to 57 pptv), C2HCl3 from -74 to 884 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (0.4 to 11 pptv), methyl chloride (CH3Cl) from -5300 to 10,800 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (530 to 730 pptv), methyl bromide (CH3Br) from -111 to 118 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (7.5 to 14 pptv) and methyl iodide (CH3I) from -25 to 17 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (0.4 to 2.8 pptv). Taking into account statistical uncertainties, the coastal sites (particularly those where soil is mixed with salt deposits) were identified as sources of all VHOCs, but this was not statistically significant for CHCl3. Further away from the coastal area, the bare soil sites were sources for CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, CHCl3, and probably also for CH2Br2 and CH3I, and the agricultural sites were sources for CHBr3, CHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2. In contrast to previous reports, we also observed emissions of brominated trihalomethanes, with net molar fluxes ordered as follows: CHBr2Cl> CHCl3 > CHBr3 > CHBrCl2 and lowest positive flux incidence for CHCl3 among all trihalomethanes; this finding can be explained by the soil's enrichment with Br. Correlation analysis, in agreement with recent studies, indicated common controls for the emission of CHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2 and likely also for CHBr3. There were no indications for correlation of the brominated trihalomethanes with CHCl3. Also in line with previous reports, we observed elevated emissions of CHCl3 and C2HCl3 from mixtures of soil and different salt-deposited structures; the flux correlations between these compounds and methyl halides (particularly CH3I) suggested that at least CH3I is also emitted via similar mechanisms or is subjected to similar controls. Overall, our results indicate elevated emission of VHOCs from bare soil under semiarid conditions. Along with other recent studies, our findings point to the strong emission potential of a suite of VHOCs from saline soils and salt lakes and call for additional studies of emission rates and mechanisms of VHOCs from saline soils and salt lakes.

Across two distinct seasonal plankton assemblages, microzooplankton dominated both phytoplankton and bacteria grazing and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization. Mass-specific ingestion rates by microzooplankton were,20 times higher than ingestion rates of crustaceans. Although most carbon ingested by microzooplankton was in the form of bacteria, microzooplankton inflicted substantially higher mortalities (both in absolute terms and relative to maximum potential growth rates) on both phytoplankton and bacteria compared with crustaceans. Mass-specific P and N excretion rates were also higher (by 70 and 50 times, respectively) than crustacean excretion rates. These results suggest that microzooplankton grazing and nutrient mineralization are driving forces affecting bacteria and phytoplankton dynamics, playing important roles in carbon and nutrient transfer to upper trophic levels even in pelagic freshwater systems containing abundant crustaceans.

Species examined were paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), and eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). Onset of xylem cell production was observed in all species by 22 May 1999, and ended as early as mid-July and early August for white spruce and eastern white cedar, respectively. Xylem cell production in the remaining species ended between late August and mid-September. In general, the onset of latewood production ranged from the start of July to the first week of August. Typical sigmoidal curves were characteristic of ring width, number of cells, and number of earlywood cells over the growing season. Completion of the annual growth increment was quickest for white spruce and eastern white cedar, while it continued longest in both pine species. Numerous similarities in xylem production and tree ring formation over the course of the growing season were observed among the six species, suggesting that weather, along with photoperiod, plays a critical role in xylem production.																			0008-4026					MAY	2007	85	5					518	525		10.1139/B07-041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B07-041													WOS:000248571000008
J	Thompson, LG; Mosley-Thompson, E; Henderson, KA				Thompson, LG; Mosley-Thompson, E; Henderson, KA			Ice-core palaeoclimate records in tropical South America since the Last Glacial Maximum	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Ice-core records spanning the last 25 000 yr from the tropical Andes of South America are reviewed. These records from Quelccaya, Huascaran and Sajama present a high temporal resolution picture of both the Late Glacial Stage (LGS) and the Holocene climatic and environmental conditions in the South American Andes. Late Glacial Stage conditions at high elevations appear to have been cooler than today, although the magnitude of the inferred cooling differs with the particular proxy used (e.g. snowline depression, pollen, ice cores). Insoluble dust and anion concentrations in the ice cores reveal that LGS hydrological conditions in the tropics (9 degrees S) were much drier than today, whereas in the subtropics (18 degrees S) LGS conditions were much wetter. This probably reflects the migration of the tropical Hadley Cell in response to a different meridional temperature gradient. Low nitrate concentrations in the LGS ice from both Huascaran and Sajama suggest that the Amazon Basin forest cover may have been much less extensive. Discussed is the conundrum surrounding the use of delta(18)O as a palaeothermometer in the tropics, where temperatures exhibit little seasonal variation yet the ice-core records suggest that delta(18)O records temperature variations on decadal to millennial time-scales. Finally evidence is presented for a strong twentieth century warming. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Physiological and morphological studies, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the new isolates were performed. Based on sequences of the 16S rRNA and methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha-subunit (mcrA) genes all new isolates are closely related to known mesophilic and psychrotolerant methanogens. Both, phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic properties allow to classify strains MT, MS, and MM as members of the genus Methanosarcina. Strain MT is a new ecotype of Methanosarcina mazei, whereas strains MM and MS are very similar to each other and can be assigned to the recently described psychrotolerant species Methanosarcina lacustris. The hydrogenotrophic strain MSP is a new ecotype of the genus Methanocorpusculum. The obligately methylotrophic strain ZB is closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica and can be classified as new ecotype of this species. All new isolates, including the strains from permanently cold environments, are not true psychrophiles according to their growth temperature characteristics. In spite of the ability of all isolates to grow at temperatures as low as 1-5 degreesC, all of them have their growth optima in the range of moderate temperatures (25-35 degreesC). Thus, they can be regarded as psychrotolerant organisms. Psychrotolerant methanogens are thought to play an important role in methane production in both, habitats under seasonal temperature variations or from permanently cold areas.

In addition, bioaccumulation of heavy metals (BCFs) and carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessments of consumers exposed to heavy metals through fish consumption were estimated. The water concentration of all metals in this study was lower than permissible limits. The concentration of Zn in the water (10.21-17.11 mu g L-1) was higher than that of other metals in all sites, followed by Pb > Cd > Hg. In fish muscle, Zn concentration in silver carp was the highest, and the lowest concentrations were related to Hg and Cd in common carp and grass carp, respectively. The target hazard quotients (THQ) indicated that the non-carcinogenic health risk to humans was relatively low by consuming four farmed carp species products. The carcinogenic risk of inorganic Pb was 1.24E-04 (common carp) to 2.11E-04 (grass carp) for adults, which is within the acceptable range.

The results indicated that the concentrations of heavy metals in the farmed carp species in North Iran were relatively low and did not cause considerable human health risks.

J	Chen, XQ; Zong, YQ; Zhang, EF; Xu, EG; Li, SJ				Chen, XQ; Zong, YQ; Zhang, EF; Xu, EG; Li, SJ			Human impacts on the Changjiang (Yangtze) River basin, China, with special reference to the impacts on the dry season water discharges into the sea	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The annual mean discharge from the upper Changjiang (Yangtze) basin has shown a significant decreasing trend since the end of the 19th century. Since the 1970s, the monthly mean discharge to the sea has also shown a dramatic decrease during dry seasons. This paper examines the human impacts on the major hydrological processes in the Changjiang River basin, with a special focus on their influence on the discharge from the drainage basin to the sea during the dry season. Climatic warming has been obvious since the 1960s in the headwater area, resulting a continuous retreat of glaciers, while the increased evaporation is responsible for the dropping of lake water levels and decrease in water area. Such a trend continuing into the coming decades will significantly chance the seasonal hydrological processes, especially the dry-season discharges from the upper basin. The decreasing vegetation cover and the increasing reservoir volume capacity also impacted on the water discharge over the past decades, although in different ways. The possible impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on the monthly variation of water discharge to the sea are discussed with special emphasis. In the middle basin discussions are focused on the effect of decreasing lake area, of increasing reservoir capacity, and of irrigated agriculture on the temporal chan-es of water discharge since the 1950s. The human impacts on water discharge from the lower basin to the sea are mostly attributed to water transfer to both tributary and neighboring drainage basins by a large number of electric pumping stations and sluices. The total water transferring capacity is more than 5000 m(3)/s along the lower river. Studies indicate that in a dry season the water discharge to the sea is greatly reduced and results in strong saltwater intrusion in the estuary. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Poyang Lake is a typical floodplain lake linked to the Yangtze River and is significantly affected by water level fluctuations. In this study, we examined the differences of soil organic matter (SOM) properties, bacterial communities and carbon metabolic functions between dry (March) and wet (August) seasons in lake centre, delta and floodplain from Poyang Lake. Generally, the SOM properties (quantity and quality) and microbially mediated carbon metabolism in the three types of sampling areas have undergone greater changes from dry to wet season than bacterial community. Structural equation modelling and variation partition analysis indicated that SOM properties contributed more in shaping the carbon metabolism of microorganisms than bacterial community structures, especially in lake centre. Dry-wet seasonal changes of microbially mediated carbon metabolism in lake centre were mainly affected by amide C=O-1650 and aliphatic C-H-2850,H- 2924, while the delta and floodplain were mainly affected by aromatic C-O-1234. Furthermore, we also found that bacterial community composition could better explain the effects of seasonal hydrology on carbon metabolism, rather than the diversity and assembly processes. We highlight that studies on tightly coupled changes in SOM and microbially mediated carbon metabolism can enhance the understanding of soil carbon dynamics across the floodplain lake.					; Liu, Ya-Jun/ABF-9182-2022; Wang, Binhua/B-5601-2014; Mou, Xiaozhen/AAG-2806-2020	Liu, Yajun/0009-0009-8706-3656; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2023	16	3								10.1002/eco.2510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2510		DEC 2022											WOS:000914168600001

This study identifies a small delta discharged by a seasonal stream flowing into Daihai Lake, in northern China, which is driven by ephemeral and high-energy flood events. Detailed 3D facies architecture was analyzed using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and sedimentary logs from outcrop and trenches. Four types of radar surfaces, including truncations of underlying inclined strata, weak reflections, and depositional surface of downlap and onlap, were identified. Six radar facies (high-angle oblique-tangential, low-angle subparallel, gently plane parallel, plane-parallel, chaotic, and continuous strong reflection) were identified based on distinctive reflections, including amplitude, continuity, dip, and termination patterns. Five depositional units (Unit A to E) were documented from proximal to distal delta. Seasonal discharge signatures include significant grain-size decrease over short distance, abundant Froude supercritical flow sedimentary structures, poorly developed barforms, and small-scale scour and fill structures. Records of lake-level and sediment budget were evaluated over the past 60 years. In highstand stage (1960-1980), amalgamated channel (Units A and B), and delta front (Unit C) were deposited. In slope stage (1980-1996), the lower deposits (Units A, B, C) were eroded by Unit D with a distinct truncation surface. In lowstand stage, most eroded sediments bypassed the incised channel and accumulated in the distal part, in which a new depositional unit was formed (Unit E). The model demonstrates that deltas fed by seasonal rivers tend to accumulate large amounts of sediments carried by high magnitude floods within short periods.

Seasonal patterns in hydrochemical mixing in three Great Lakes rivermouth ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rivermouth ecosystems in the Laurentian Great Lakes represent complex hydrologic mixing zones where lake and river water combine to form biologically productive areas that are functionally similar to marine estuaries. As urban, industrial, shipping, and recreational centers, rivermouths are the focus of human interactions with the Great lakes and, likewise, may represent critical habitat for larval fish and other biota. The hydrology and related geomorphology in these deltaic systems form the basis for ecosystem processes and wetland habitat structure but are poorly understood. To this end, we examined hydrogeomorphic structure and lake-tributary mixing in three rivermouths of intermediate size using water chemistry, stable isotopes, and current profiling over a five-month period. In rivermouths of this size, the maximum depth of the rivermouth ecosystem influenced water mixing, with temperature-related, density-dependent wedging and layering that isolated lake water below river water occurring in deeper systems. The inherent size of the rivermouth ecosystem, local geomorphology, and human modifications such as shoreline armoring and dredging influenced mixing by altering the propensity for density differences to occur. The improved scientific understanding and framework for characterizing hydrogeomorphic processes in Great Lakes rivermouths across a disturbance gradient is useful for conservation, management, restoration, and protection of critical habitats needed by native species.

This study developed an integrated approach containing Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL) and a dynamic nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) network to decompose and estimate the nutrient concentrations in Lake Erhai, a preliminary eutrophic lake in China. The STL decomposition results indicated that total nitrogen (TN) concentration of Lake Erhai progressively descended from 2006 to 2014, except for some agriculture area. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2013 and then decreased in 2014, but in the area near the tourist attractions, TP increased continuously from 2011 to 2014. Seasonal variations in TN and TP indicated that the lowest water quality of Lake Erhai occurred from July to October. Based on results obtained with STL, TP was selected as the sensitive parameter, as it showed a significant deterioration trend, and the area near the tourist attractions was selected as the sensitive area. Three variables (DO, pH, and water temperature) were selected as input parameters to estimate TP using the dynamic NARX model. The NARX modeling results demonstrated that it can accurately estimate TP concentrations with low root-mean-square error (0.0071mg/L). The study establishes a new approach to better understand trends and variations in nutrient levels and to better refine estimates by identifying more easily accessible physical parameters in a preliminary eutrophic lake.

Phenotypic Plasticity of the Amur Sleeper (Perccottus glenii) Invasive Populations during the Colonization of Water Bodies	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The variability of the body shape in invasive fish species-Amur sleeper (Perccottus glenii)-from natural and anthropogenic water bodies of the Middle Urals, with different completeness of the species composition, was studied by the use of geometric morphometric methods. We compared samples of Amur sleepers from adjacent water bodies-Lake Shitovskoye and two peat quarries filled with water. Samples of different seasons and years of collection were taken in the lake, which allowed us to correlate the influence of climate and season on the morphogenesis of the Amur sleeper. According to the control catches, the fish community of the lake is represented by ten species; i.e., it is a species-rich community: six native species (roach, river perch, ruff, tench, crucian carp, and pike) and four alien species (bream, belica, Amur sleeper, carp). The share of Amur sleepers in the control catches in the lake was no more than 3-5%. In the water bodies of peat quarries, species-poor communities of two species were formed (Amur sleeper and crucian carp). Discriminant analysis of the body shape of fish from the lake and peat quarries allowed us to reveal the origin of 93-98% of specimens. Comparing the samples of the younger (2+-3+ years) and older (4+-7+ years) age groups of fish divided by sex and biotope, different directions of changes in the shape of the Amur sleeper's body in ontogenesis were revealed between the biotopic groups. The range of age variability was almost 5 times lower than the intergroup biotopic differences of fish from ecologically contrasting water bodies. The seasonal and interannual intrapopulation variability of body shape in Amur sleepers in the lake is significantly less pronounced than the intergroup differences between samples from the lake and peat quarries. Sex differences accounted for only 6% of the intergroup variance (3 times lower than the level of age differences), and in the species-rich lake community, sex differences decrease with age, and in the water bodies of quarries, on the contrary, they increase. Intragroup morphological disparity (MNND) was significantly higher in samples from peat quarries. The data obtained are of a key character, since they characterize a high degree of phenotypic plasticity of the Amur sleeper and a rapid adaptive restructuring of its morphogenesis to different conditions of natural and anthropogenic water bodies of the Middle Urals.

The current study describes the length-weight relationships (LWRs) and length-length relationships (LLRs) of six fish species (Cyprinus carpio, Carassius carassius, Schizothorax niger, S. curvifrons, Crossocheilus diplochilus and Pethia conchonius) based on seasonal fish sampling from the Dal Lake during September 2019 to August 2020. The estimated LWRs and LLRs were highly significant (p < 0.05) with high coefficient of determination r(2) and the estimated b values ranged from 2.50 to 3.55. The estimated b values revealed negative allometric growth of fish species except P. conchonius which possesses positive allometric growth.

REMOTE SENSING												High-latitude lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change. Monitoring lake dynamics in high-latitude regions (e.g., pan-Arctic regions) is essential to improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change; however, the lack of in situ water level measurements limits comprehensive quantification of the lake hydrologic dynamics in high-latitude regions. Fortunately, the newly launched ICESat-2 laser altimeter can provide finer footprint measurements and denser ground tracks, thus enabling us to measure the water level changes for more lakes than with conventional radar altimeters. This study aims to comprehensively assess the number and frequency of pan-Arctic lakes (>1 km(2), north of 60 degrees N) observable by the ICESat-2 in space and time over the past three years. Further, we analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ICESat-2-based water level observations of these pan-Arctic lakes based on our customized classification of seasonal coverage patterns (wet/dry season, monthly, and ten-day). We find that the ICESat-2 observed 80,688 panArctic lakes (97% of the total). Among the observed lakes, the ICESat-2 retrieved the seasonal coverage patterns for 40,192 lakes (similar to 50% of observed lakes), accounting for nearly 84% of the area and 95% of the volumetric capacity. Most lakes (99%) have seasonal water-level fluctuation amplitudes within a range of 0-1 m. The latitudinal zonality analysis demonstrates that the seasonal change in pan-Arctic lake levels gently fluctuates around 0.5 m between 60 degrees N and 74 degrees N and becomes intense (range of level change from 1 m to 2 m) beyond 74 degrees N. Our results are expected to offer an overall reference for the spatio-temporal coverage of the ICESat-2's observations of pan-Arctic lakes, which is crucial for comprehending the hydrologic response of high-latitude lakes to ongoing climate change.

Tropical lakes in the southern hemisphere are generally impacted by human actions, such as those in Brazil, although they still preserve a great diversity of macrophyte species that can support AMF communities. Thus, the study aimed to test (i) whether AMF community structure (composition, richness, diversity, dominance, and evenness) differs between aquatic and terrestrial conditions, and (ii) between seasons-rainy and dry. A total of 60 AMF species, distributed in 10 families and 17 genera, were found, with a difference in AMF composition between conditions (terrestrial and aquatic) and seasons (dry and rainy). The absolute species richness differed between conditions, seasons, and interactions. The aquatic/rainy season, which retrieved the most significant number of species, had the highest absolute richness and number of glomerospores and differed significantly from the terrestrial/rainy season. The results suggest that a shallow oligotrophic lake harbors a high AMF richness. In addition, this environment has a distinct AMF community from the adjacent coastal sand plain vegetation and is affected by seasonality.

For this purpose, two sampling campaigns per month from five stations (North, South, Central, East and West) were conducted for a period of one year (November 2020 to November 2021). Physic and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, depth, water transparency, pH, dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids) were measured and wet substrate samples were collected to study the granulometry. Data analysis revealed that Lake Nokoue is mainly affected by two regimes: flooding and low water. Flooding, which is not directly related to rainfall, did not begin until one month after the major rainy season in June. The sources that contributed to the flooding of Lake Nokoue were the freshwater tributaries coming mainly from the Oueme River and the flow of the So River from August to November. The inflow of fresh water contributed to the decrease in salinity and transparency of the lake from the east to the south. During the low water period (from December to July), Lake Nokoue is characterized by an increase in salinity and transparency from the south to the northeast due to the massive intrusion of sea water into the lake. The highest dissolved oxygen levels are observed in the south and center (5.92 +/- 0.46 mg/L) while it varies greatly in the north and west (Eichhornia crassipes concentration zone) during flooding. The average annual depth of Lake Nokoue was 1.47 +/- 0.66 m with an average annual pH of 6.85 +/- 0.56.					; SINTONDJI, Selome Wilfried/JQW-6202-2023; SINTONDJI, Wilfried/JQW-6202-2023	SOHOU, Zacharie/0000-0003-3314-3481; Lacroix, Genevieve/0000-0002-3227-0000; SINTONDJI, Selome Wilfried/0000-0002-8720-8650; 														2673-4133				DEC	2022	3	4					467	479		10.3390/ecologies3040033	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ecologies3040033													WOS:001114158800001

However, lipids of diverse origin in lakes make it difficult to decipher environmental information, appealing for the necessity to evaluate the impact of terrigenous input on the distribution of GDGTs through long-term monitoring. In this study, we conducted two-year monitoring of GDGTs along the river, estuary, near shore, to the center of Lake Liangzi in central China. By comparing the spatiotemporal changes of GDGT distribution in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and surface sediments, we found that the archaeal isoprenoid GDGTs (isoGDGTs) were mainly produced in situ in the river-lake systems, and not affected by the soil input. In contrast, the bacterial branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) were affected, to some extent, by soil input, depending on the distance to the lakeshore. The soil input of brGDGTs was enhanced during an episode of abnormal rainfall (flood). Moreover, the large variation of isoGDGTs indicates the in situ production under the anoxic condition in lake water. The paired increase in the GDGT-0/Cren ratio and GDGT concentration might be diagnostic of flooding events in ancient times.					; Yang, Huan/AAF-9358-2021; Xie, Shucheng/E-6713-2011; Yang, Huan/E-2753-2012	, Shucheng XIE/0000-0002-5763-2928; Yang, Huan/0000-0002-3108-787X													1674-487X	1867-111X				DEC	2022	33	6			SI		1601	1613		10.1007/s12583-021-1552-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-021-1552-6													WOS:000899216700022

Denitrification mitigates N flux through the stream-floodplain complex of a desert city	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The Indian Bend Wash (IBW) flood-control project relies on a greenbelt to carry floods through Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. The greenbelt is characterized by a chain of shallow artificial lakes in a larger floodplain of irrigated turf, which has been protected from encroaching urban development. As such, this urban stream-floodplain complex can be divided into three subsystems: artificial lakes, channelized stream segments, and floodplain. We conducted experiments to evaluate which, if any, of these subsystems were important sites of denitrification, and to explore factors controlling denitrification rates. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) bioassays were conducted on sediments from eight lake and six stream segments as well as soil samples from eight floodplain transects. Mass-specific potential denitrification rates were significantly higher in lakes than in streams or floodplains. Nutrient limitation bioassays revealed that nitrate (NO3-) limited denitrification in lake sediments, a surprising finding given that NO3--rich groundwater additions frequently raised lake NO3- concentration above 1 mg N/L. Experiments on intact lake cores suggested that denitrification was limited by the rate NO3- diffused into sediments, rather than its availability in overlying water. Floodplain denitrification was limited by water content, not NO3- or C, and irrigation of soils stimulated denitrification. We constructed a N budget for the IBW stream-floodplain complex based on our experimental results. We found that both lakes and floodplains removed large quantities of N, with denitrification removing 261 and 133 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) from lake sediments and floodplain soils, respectively, indicating that lakes are hotspots for denitrification. Nevertheless, because floodplain area was >4.5 times that of lakes, floodplain soils removed nearly 2.5 times as much N as lake sediments. Given the desert's low annual precipitation, a finding that floodplain soils are active sites of denitrification might seem implausible; however, irrigation is common in urban landscapes, and it elevated annual denitrification in IBW. Based on our results, we conclude that construction of artificial lakes created hotspots while application of irrigation water created hot moments for denitrification in the stream-floodplain complex, demonstrating that management decisions can improve the ability of urban streams to provide critical ecosystem services like N retention.

PAH concentrations in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants (WTP) discharging into the South Drainage Canal and North Drainage Canal were quantified for the first time. The results showed that the discharge of the WTPs recently only contributed to the PAH contamination in the canals near the outlets of the WTPs. PAH levels in sediments of the streams were greatly higher than those in soils by riverbank probably due to receiving large amounts of untreated wastewater. Unusually high benz[a] anthracene concentration strongly influenced the seasonal and spatial variation of total PAH concentrations in South Drainage Canal. Paired samples t test of aNap, Fl, Phe, Fluo and aNap, Phe, Fluo, Chry concentrations, which were dominant components in the air samples from non-heating and heating season, respectively, in the suspended particulate matters from the streams showed that PAH source from air deposition was more important for Yongding New River than that for South Drainage Canal and North Drainage Canal. Source apportionment based on PAH profiles indicated that coal combustion was the major PAH contamination source, and coke oven sources and wood combustion also contributed to the PAH contamination of the streams. This was further indicated by organic petrography analysis.

N.; Roland, Fabio			Virus-Bacterium Coupling Driven by both Turbidity and Hydrodynamics in an Amazonian Floodplain Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The importance of viruses in aquatic ecosystem functioning has been widely described. However, few studies have examined tropical aquatic ecosystems. Here, we evaluated for the first time viruses and their relationship with other planktonic communities in an Amazonian freshwater ecosystem. Coupling between viruses and bacteria was studied, focusing both on hydrologic dynamics and anthropogenic forced turbidity in the system (Lake Batata). Samples were taken during four hydrologic seasons at both natural and impacted sites to count virus-like particles (VLP) and bacteria. In parallel, virus-infected bacteria were identified and quantified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Viral abundance ranged from 0.5 x 10(7) +/- 0.2 x 10(7) VLP ml(-1) (high-water season, impacted site) to 1.7 x 10(7) +/- 0.4 x 10(7) VLP ml(-1) (low-water season, natural site). These data were strongly correlated with the bacterial abundance (r(2) = 0.84; P < 0.05), which ranged from 1.0 x 10(6) +/- 0.5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) (high water, impacted site) to 3.4 x 10(6) +/- 0.7 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) (low water, natural site). Moreover, the viral abundance was weakly correlated with chlorophyll alpha, suggesting that most viruses were bacteriophages. TEM quantitative analyses revealed that the frequency of visibly infected cells was 20%, with 10 +/- 3 phages per cell section. In general, we found a low virus-bacterium ratio (< 7). Both the close coupling between the viral and bacterial abundances and the low virus-bacterium ratio suggest that viral abundance tends to be driven by the reduction of hosts for viral infection. Our results demonstrate that viruses are controlled by biological substrates, whereas in addition to grazing, bacteria are regulated by physical processes caused by turbidity, which affect underwater light distribution and dissolved organic carbon availability.

Salamander dispersal across a forested landscape fragmented by a golf course	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We assessed dispersal behavior of 78 radiotagged adult spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) at a 36-hole golf course in southeastern Connecticut, USA. Lake of Isles Golf Course is atypical of most golf courses in North America because it is much larger (461 ha) than average 18-hole golf courses (54 ha) and deciduous forests accounted for 70% landscape composition on the course. We tracked individuals an average of 164 days as they emigrated from 3 seasonal pools surrounded by golf course fairways and one pool located in contiguous forest (control pool) from March through December 2004. Males and females dispersed similar distances at the control pool, averaging 71 +/- 10 m. However, females migrating across the golf course dispersed twice as far (214 +/- 25 m) as males on the golf course (102 +/- 15 m) and both genders at the control pool. Over 40% the salamanders at the golf course crossed fairways; thus, fairways were not a dispersal barrier to adult spotted salamanders. Previous researchers have suggested establishing a 164-m life zone around breeding ponds to protect pond-breeding amphibian populations. Our results suggest that strategies that protect core upland habitat within 164 m of wetland boundaries would include 82% of adult males and only 50% of adult females. Empirical estimates based on our telemetry study suggest that core terrestrial habitat would have to extend 370 m to protect 95% of adult females, which is much farther than previous estimates.																			0022-541X					JUN	2007	71	4					1163	1169		10.2193/2006-380	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-380													WOS:000247168500019

Results indicate substantial variability in basin hydro-ecology over the past 300 years ranging from seasonal to periodic desiccation in the 1700s to markedly wetter conditions during the early 1800s to early 1900s. The reconstruction is consistent with (1) dry climatic conditions that defined the peak of the Little Ice Age and subsequent amelioration evident in conventional ring-width and isotopic analyses of tree-ring records located hydrologically and climatically upstream of the PAD, and (2) Peace River flood history inferred from sub-annual magnetic susceptibility measurements from another lake sediment record in the Peace sector of the PAD. Although regulation of the Peace River for hydroelectric power generation since 1968 has long been considered a major stressor of the PAD ecosystem leading to reduced frequency of ice-jam and open-water flooding and an extended period of drying, our results show that current hydro-ecological status is not unprecedented as both wetter and drier conditions have persisted for decades in the recent past under natural climatic variability. Furthermore, paleolimnological evidence from Spruce Island Lake indicates that recently observed dryness is part of a longer trend which began some 20-40 years prior to Peace River regulation.

J	Huryn, AD; Wallace, JB				Huryn, AD; Wallace, JB			Life history and production of stream insects	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY												Studies of the production of stream insects are now numerous, and general factors controlling the secondary production of stream communities are becoming evident. In this review we focus on how life-history attributes influence the production dynamics of stream insects and other macroinvertebrates. Annual production of macroinvertebrate communities in streams world-wide ranges from approximately 10(0) to 10(3) g dry mass m(-2). High levels are reported for communities dominated by filter feeders in temperate streams. Filter feeding enables the accrual and support of high biomass, which drives the very highest production. Frequently disturbed communities in warm-temperate streams are also highly productive. Biomass accrual by macroinvertebrates is limited in these streams, and production is driven by rapid growth rates rather than high biomass. The lowest production, reported for macroinvertebrate communities of cool-temperate and arctic streams, is due to the constraints of low seasonal temperatures and nutrient or food limitation. Geographical bias, paucity of community-wide studies, and limited knowledge of the effects of biotic interactions limit current understanding of mechanisms controlling stream productivity.																			0066-4170	1545-4487					2000	45						83	110		10.1146/annurev.ento.45.1.83	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ento.45.1.83								10761571					WOS:000086173900004

The water column conditions locally experience notable fluctuations across the year, mostly driven by biannual monsoon seasons. Salinity, temperature, and pH often reach extreme values, unsustainable for the majority of the marine fauna. Therefore, the biodiversity of the benthic macrofauna in this peculiar habitat is remarkably low. In particular, a single sponge species new to science was found solely populating this characteristic brackish lake during our last survey in August 2018. Spongilla manconiae sp. nov. is a new Porifera species described here. It belongs to an exclusively freshwater taxon and seems to have acquired adaptive traits to tolerate extreme peaks of temperature and salinity. The mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacers 1 and 2 (ITSs) gene markers were used for barcoding tagging and phylogenetic analyses. The new species revealed large genetic distances and separate clustering in the tree topology, with respect to other reference spongillid sequences from various geographic areas. The study provides evidence for an urgency to protect these unique marine lake systems because they represent rare, fluctuant, fragile habitats that may speed up speciation processes.					; Pons, Laura/O-2795-2014; Cerrano, Carlo/AAF-3557-2019; Bertolino, Marco/AAI-7707-2020	Nunez Pons, Laura/0000-0001-8155-3798; Cerrano, Carlo/0000-0001-9580-5546; BERTOLINO, Marco/0000-0003-3233-303X; CALCINAI, BARBARA/0000-0002-9004-0051														2077-1312				DEC	2020	8	12							1008	10.3390/jmse8121008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse8121008													WOS:000601979700001

Regional Pelagic Rotifer Biodiversity in a Tropical Karst Lake District	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The species richness, composition, abundance, and biomass of pelagic rotifers were determined in 17 karst lakes of the "Lagunas de Montebello" National Park, Chiapas, Mexico. The species richness of the region (21 species) and single lakes (1-12 species) was smaller than that of other Mexican, tropical, and temperate lakes. It is worth noting the high dissimilarity in species composition-about half (52%) of the species were observed in only 1-3 lakes. A total of eight rotifer families, all from the Monogononta subclass, were recorded. Keratella americana was the species with the highest occurrence (13 lakes), followed by Ptygura sp. (8 lakes). The abundance (0 to 536 ind L-1) and biomass (0 to 21 mu g L-1) of rotifers were low. The highest values of species richness, abundance, and biomass were found in eutrophic lakes, and the lowest in oligotrophic lakes. The low values of rotifer biodiversity, abundance, and biomass in the Montebello lakes are probably the product of the interaction of different factors-such as environmental homogeneity (all water bodies are karst lakes), the low availability of "good-quality" food, and predation by cyclopoid copepods in the eutrophic lakes, and the low availability of food, and competitive interference by calanoid copepods and cladocerans in the oligotrophic lakes.

The piscivorous habits of giant otters lead to negative human perception and conflicts with fisheries. We compared giant otter feeding habits between seasons and habitats in the Southern Pantanal, Brazil, by analyzing feces collected between September 2008 and June 2011.We investigated whether habitat and season affected P. brasiliensis diet composition and prey size. We calculated the frequency of occurrence, relative frequency, and overlap of fish species eaten by giant otters and caught by fishermen. The giant otters had a more diverse assemblage of fish prey than the offtake in the fisheries. We did not find strong seasonality in otter diets, but diet composition and prey size differed between rivers and lakes. The giant otter diet had higher overlap with the offtake of sport than with professional fishermen. Although the otters' piscivorous diet often leads to negative perceptions by humans, the low overlap between otter diet and species taken in local fisheries suggests that otters have little effect on the commercial fishery. These results indicate that educational programs could be used to reduce perceived conflict between giant otters and fishermen.

Photo-oxidation rates ranged from 8.96 to 415.06 mu mol C center dot L(-1 center dot)day(-1), being higher in the beginning to middle of the rainy season and declining throughout the year. Although dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, water color, and sunlight incidence were generally higher in the rainy season, photo-oxidation rates were not significantly related to any of these parameters. Photo-oxidation seems to be influenced mainly by changes in DOC photoreactivity, which was up to threefold higher early in the rainy season, when inputs of fresh allochthonous DOC take place. In the following months, in addition to being continuously degraded by sunlight, DOC is also removed from the water column by processes such as microbial degradation and sedimentation, leading to a decline in DOC concentration and photoreactivity throughout the year until the next rainy season. Thus, the dynamics of DOC inputs caused by the rainfall regime in Comprida Lagoon lead to a yearly pulse of DOC photoreactivity and photo-oxidation rates. We believe this pulse model also fits other aquatic ecosystems subject to similar seasonal inputs of allochthonous DOC, although rainfall would not necessarily be the driving factor.

Species composition differed significantly between the gears, with four significant contributors in gillnet catches and one in trawl catches. Trawling collected more proportions of benthic species by number and biomass than gillnetting. Size distribution was significantly influenced by fishing technique; gillnetting captured relatively less small-sized fishes and trawling captured less large-sized individuals. Trawling produced species richness closer to the one expected than gillnetting. On the whole, trawl catch was a quadratic polynomial function of gillnet catch and a significantly negative correlation was found between them, both of which varied as different polynomial functions of temperature. However, trawl and gillnet catches were significantly correlated only in one of five month groups. It is concluded that single-gear-based surveys can be misleading in assessments of attributes of fish assemblages, bottom trawling is a more effective gear for assessing fish diversity than benthic gillnetting, and using gillnet catches as an indicator of fish density depends on fishing season in the lake.					zhang, hongcheng/O-9719-2015; Li, Yalei/IQS-0680-2023; , 苹/AAV-3159-2020	Li, Yalei/0000-0003-0871-6321; Chen, Liqiao/0000-0003-0138-7828													2096-5508					MAR	2018	36	2					572	586		10.1007/s00343-018-6219-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-6219-5													WOS:000431662200037

HYDROBIOLOGIA												The impact of cumulative daily solar radiation (CDSR) on the biomass of river phytoplankton (Chl-a) in the growing season was studied using a large dataset of rivers in the Carpathian Basin. The amount of solar radiation was cumulated over the range of 1-60 days. The CDSR-Chl-a relationship could be described by linear regression and appeared to be significant for almost all watercourses with the exception of rivers with short water residence time. To determine the most relevant time period of CDSR impacting phytoplankton biomass, the slopes of regressions were plotted against the accumulating number of days of light exposure (1-60). Two characteristic shapes were obtained: unimodal for rhithral rivers with hard substrate and steady increase for lowland potamal rivers with fine substrate. In both cases, there is an increasing tendency in the slope values with water residence time (WRT). It was demonstrated that CDSR has a pronounced impact on river phytoplankton biomass even in cases when WRT was shorter than the cumulated solar radiation period. These results indicate that development of phytoplankton within the river channel is a complex process in which meroplankton dynamics may have significant impacts. Our results have two implications: First, CDSR cannot be neglected in predictive modelling of riverine phytoplankton biomass. Second, climate models forecast increased drought with subsequently increased CDSR in several regions globally, which may trigger a rise in phytoplankton biomass in light-limited rivers with high nutrient concentrations.

We hypothesize that seasonal changes in DOC quality, related to the flood pulse, drive the effects of light-DOC interactions on uptake by planktonic bacteria uptake in clear-water Amazonian ecosystems. Water samples from two ecosystems (one lake and one stream) were incubated in sunlight during different hydrological periods and were then exposed to bacterial degradation. Photochemical and bacterial degradation were driven by seasonal DOC inputs. Bacterial mineralization was the main degradation pathway of autochthonous DOC in the lake, while allochthonous DOC was more available for photochemical oxidation. We suggest that sunlight enhances the bacterial uptake of refractory DOC but does not alter uptake of labile forms. We also observed a positive relationship between sunlight and bacterial degradation of DOC, instead of competition. We conclude that photochemical reactions and bacteria complementarily degrade the different sources of DOC during the flood pulse in Amazonian clear-water aquatic ecosystems.

They are regulated by a seasonal climatic regime characterized by a wet-rainy season from October to March and then followed by a dry season. Underground water is abundant and rivers frequently overflow during the rainy season. Many of these wetlands which are protected by law are significant regulators of water quality. In order to predict tropical wetland function and draw up environmental management policies, it is important to understand how abiotic and biotic factors influence tropical wetland origin and spatial distribution. In this large-scale study we set out to investigate the influence that geological and geormorphological settings, i.e. geological substrates and geomorphological units, have on the spatial distribution of tropical wetlands in Central Brazil. Two watersheds, the Caiapo and Piracanjuba, were selected in order to carry out the study. They present different types of rock and unconsolidated surface materials. Planation surface, escarpment and steep slope, gentle slope, and aggradation are the dominant geomorphological units in the watersheds. Principal component analysis was conducted in order to determine the influence of the selected abiotic variables on the spatial distribution of tropical wetlands. The study showed that the presence of sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic rocks and planation surface strongly influence the spatial distribution of the more terrestrial-type wetlands. Geological and geomorphological settings explain about 60% of the variability in the spatial distribution of these wetland types. No clear effect of the abiotic variables selected was observed on the more aquatic-type wetlands. An association between stratified layers or planar geological surfaces, groundwater discharge zones, and slope breaks is suggested to explain the influence of the geological and geomorphological settings on the wetlands under review. The study demonstrated the importance of considering abiotic factors, not usually included in classification schemes, to further understand the spatial distribution of tropical wetlands.

Late Devonian tetrapod habitats indicated by palaeosols in Pennsylvania	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Late Devonian (Famennian) tetrapods from the Duncannon Member of the Catskill Formation, near Hyner (Pennsylvania, USA) have been found within palacosols that offer a new line of evidence for their ancient environments. Hyner has yielded at least two fossil tetrapod species, Hynerpeton basseti and Densignathus rowei. Subhumid Vertisol palacosols and semiarid Aridisol palacosols alternate at Hyner, as in other Catskill Formation sedimentary cycles attributed to Milankovitch-eccentricity periods (100 ka). Tetrapods were found in palaeosols of subhumid. not semiarid, phases of 100 ka palaeoclimate cycles. In addition, palacosols at Hyner record all unusually warm and wet climatic episode compared with other palaeosols of the Catskill Formation, and correlated with the European Annulala black shale event. Tetrapod bones are cracked and disarticulated in red palaeosols of an oxbow lake margin, as if victims of dry-season death, decay, and subaerial weathering. Vegetation-choked swales and floodplains would have afforded shelter from 3-4 m long predatory fish (Hyneria lindae) of open water, and offered food of large dead fish, small live fish, arachnids, myriapods and scorpions. If these early tetrapods lived on land at all, it was during wet seasons of feeding and breeding, rather than fatally dry seasons.																			0016-7649	2041-479X				NOV	2009	166		6				1143	1156		10.1144/0016-76492009-022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/0016-76492009-022													WOS:000271845500014

Under low light intensity (reduced by 99%), the plant biomass changed with seasonal changes, plant competition, and environmental stress. The competitive capability for light differed in the four species due to different shoot height and tiller number. After 405 days of transplantation, H. verticillata became dominant in all communities. The biomass of H. verticillata, with strong ability to endure low water light environment, accounted for more than 90% of the total community biomass, and P. malaianus had only weak growth, while V spiralis and N. marina almost disappeared. Based on livability and biomass of submerged macrophytes on two sediment types, brown clay sediment appeared to be more favorable for the settlement of the plants, while fertile sludge sediment was suitable for vegetative growth. In conclusion, the improvement of habitats and the selection of appropriate plant species are of the greatest importance for ecological restoration of the aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The waters were collected seasonally from five main rivers during pre-monsoon (late May), monsoon (late July), and post-monsoon (middle October). The LQRS waters are all very alkaline and have high concentrations of TDS (total dissolved solids) compared to rivers draining the Himalayas and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Seasonal variations in the water chemistry show that, except the Daotang River, the TDS concentration is high in October and low in July in the LQRS waters. The forward models were used to quantify the input of three main rivers (Buha River, Shaliu River, and Hargai River) from rain, halite, carbonates, and silicates. The results suggest that (1) atmospheric input is the first important source for the waters of the Buha River and the Shaliu River, contributing 36-57% of the total dissolved cations, (2) carbonate weathering input and atmospheric input have equal contribution to the Hargai River water, (3) carbonate weathering has higher contribution to these rivers than silicate weathering, and (4) halite is also important source for the Buha River. The Daotang River water is dominated by halite input owing to its underlying old lacustrine sediments. The water compositions of the Heima River are controlled by carbonate weathering and rainfall input in monsoon season, and groundwater input may be important in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. After being corrected the atmospheric input, average CO2 drawdown via silicate weathering in the LQRS is 35 x 10(3) mol/km(2) per year, with highest in monsoon season, lower than Himalayas and periphery of Tibetan Plateau rivers but higher than some rivers draining shields.

Spatial and temporal patterns of ciliate species composition (Protozoa: Ciliophora) in the plankton of the Upper Parana River floodplain	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY					3rd Workshop on the Upper Parana River Floodplain - Conservation and Biodiversity	JUN 10-12, 2008	Maringa, BRAZIL					Spatial and temporal patterns of plankton ciliates species composition in the Parana River floodplain were investigated. Samplings were carried out in twelve environments in two distinct hydrological periods (limnophase and potamophase). A total of 61 species of ciliates were recorded, and among them 21 are classified as pelagic while 40 are considered preferentially as littoral species. The registered species belong to eleven orders, and among them, Prostomatida was the most specious followed by Hymenostomatida and Peritrichida. The ciliate species composition was significantly distinct between periods, but not among environments. In this way, typically pelagic species characterized the ciliate community during the limnophase period, while the littoral species were predominant during the potamophase period. Our results strongly Support the idea of the flood pulse as the main factor driving the composition pattern of the planktonic ciliates community in the Parana River floodplain.

Status of phytoplankton biomass and physico-chemical parameters of water during fish cage culture fallowing: a case study of Southeast Arm of Lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The prospect of using fallowing as an ecosystem management measure to restore ecosystem functions in disturbed aquatic environments under cage culture was evaluated in this study. The cage aquaculture site in the Southeast arm of Lake Malawi was studied following the abandonment of cage aquaculture activities in 2022 after 18 years of operation. A Hydrolab CTD MS5 series probe was cast at each station to a maximum depth to collect electronic data and provide in situ depth profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, pH and salinity. Chlorophyl-extraction was done using a mixture of acetone and methanol and analyzed on a turner series 10 fluorometer. The study found that physical-chemical parameters such as temperature, pH, ammonia, turbidity and dissolved oxygen were not significantly different (p > 0.05) across the cage and non-cage sites and between seasons. However, ammonia levels recorded in this study were lower than the values reported during the cage culture operations period, an indication that some recovery processes are happening at the site. Chlorophyl a level was found to be insignificantly higher in cage and non-cage sites (p > 0.0.5) and significantly different between season (p < 0.05). High levels of Chl-a observed in this study are independent of cage aquaculture but might be linked to external inputs associated with tributaries as they collectively drain into the lake. Chl-a was found to be significantly and directly correlated to temperature, followed by total suspended solids and pH. Overall, the site is undergoing recovery with respect to the abandonment, but the effect is masked by external inputs of nutrients into the Lake. Although the study confirmed the oligotrophic status of the lake, the increasing levels of Chl-a are alarming and calls for inclusion of watershed management in agriculture and environmental management programming to sustainably safeguard the health of the Lake.

J	Schmidt, A; Schubert, M				Schmidt, Axel; Schubert, Michael			Using radon-222 for tracing groundwater discharge into an open-pit lignite mining lake - a case study	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												Groundwater discharge into an open pit lignite mining lake was investigated using radon-222 as a naturally occurring environmental tracer. The chosen study site was a rneromictic lake, i.e.,a waterbody that is divided horizontally into two separate layers - the upper mixolimnion (with seasonal mixing) and the lower monimolimnion (without seasonal mixing). For the estimation of groundwater discharge rates into the lake, a simple box model including all radon sinks and sources related to each layer was applied. Two field investigations were performed. During the October campaign, the total groundwater discharge into the lake was found to be 18.9 and 0.7 m(3) d(-1) for the mixolimnion and monimolimnion, respectively. During the December campaign, the groundwater discharge into the mixolimnion was 15.0 m(3) d(-1), whereas no discharge at all was observed into the monimolimnion. Based on the given water volumes, the residence time of lake water was 5.3 years for the monimolimnion and varies between 0.9 and 1.1 years for the mixolimnion. The investigation confirmed radon to be a useful environmental tracer for groundwater and surface water interactions in meromictic lake environments.																			1025-6016					DEC	2007	43	4					387	400		10.1080/10256010701705419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256010701705419								18041626					WOS:000252667600011
J	Schulze, PC				Schulze, Peter C.			Evidence that fish structure the zooplankton communities of turbid lakes and reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Visually foraging fish typically exclude large zooplankton from clear-water lakes and reservoirs. Do fish have the same effect in turbid waters, or does turbidity provide a refuge from visual predation? 2. To test the hypothesis that fish exclude large zooplankton species from turbid sites, I searched for populations of medium or large Daphnia species in turbid, fish-containing reservoirs of south-central Oklahoma and north-central Texas, U.S.A., and surveyed the literature for accounts of Daphnia species in turbid habitats worldwide. 3. Only small Daphnia species and the exuberantly spined Daphnia lumholtzi were detected in the turbid reservoirs. The Daphnia species in the reservoirs are smaller than other Daphnia species that occur in the area but were not detected. An extensive survey of the literature suggests that large Daphnia may be found in the lakes of extreme turbidity [Secchi disk depth (SD) < 0.2 m] but that only small and spiny Daphnia are likely to occur in more typical turbid locations (1.0 m > SD > 0.2 m) unless some additional factor reduces the influence of fish predation in such sites. 4. The field samples from Texas and Oklahoma together with the literature review suggest that the effect of visually foraging planktivorous fish on the size structure of turbid-water zooplankton communities may often be as strong or even stronger than the effect of fish on clear-water zooplankton communities.

The assemblage of aerobic methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) was investigated in different seasons in the water column of a stratified freshwater lake. Species composition was analysed by performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the 16S rRNA genes and cloning analysis of the pmoA gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase. The relative abundance of MOB to total bacteria was deduced from the copy number of the pmoA gene and 16S rRNA gene using real-time polymerase chain reaction. 2. The profiles of the DGGE banding patterns changed with water depth, and these changes correlated with oxygen concentration and water temperature. The sequences of the DGGE bands obtained were all associated with the genus Methylobacter. During the analysis of pmoA gene, all clones sequenced were that of the Methylobacter/Methylosarcina group. The relative abundances of pmoA gene peaked around the oxycline, and small peaks of pmoA gene were also observed near the surface when peaks of methane were observed at the corresponding depth. 3. Profiles of the DGGE banding patterns suggested that ecophysiological characteristics differ among members of the genus Methylobacter; this indicates the importance of investigating the MOB assemblage at the species level or lower. Planktonic MOB seemed to be abundant around oxycline.

It has been hit by frequent floods in past few decades. Study focus: Lake-reservoir groups (LRG) are important in extreme hydrologic event mitigation in watersheds. This study used runoff-weighted model to quantify the influence of LRG on the flood mitigation in Poyang Lake based on weekly observations of GF-1 and Sentinel-1. New hydrological insights for the region: The weekly water storage volume of LRG in the Poyang Lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing (April-September) first and then decreasing (October-March) from 2016 to 2020. The runoff-weighted model has a better effect on the calculation of detained flood volume and residence time of retained flood. The average annual total detained flood volume of LRG were 4.39 x 10(8) m(3), 5.06 x 10(8) m(3), 1.64 x 10(8) m(3), 0.54 x 10(8) m(3), and 0.15 x 10(8) m(3) in the Xiushui, Ganjiang, Fuhe, Xinjiang, and Raohe basins, respectively, among which Xiushui and Ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention. The residence time of retained flood by LRG in the five basins are long during the dry season (October to March) but short during the wet season (April to September), and they are generally longer than those in the natural state with no reservoir. The delay days of the LRG to flood peaks were about 12, 7, 13, 22, and 26 d for each basin, respectively.					; Lu, Jianzhong/E-5698-2013	Lu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-6432-8481; Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138														2214-5818				DEC	2022	44								101265	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101265		NOV 2022											WOS:000897667800004

Natural distribution and co-infection patterns of microsporidia parasites in the Daphnia longispina complex	PARASITOLOGY												Microsporidia are intracellular parasites, frequently infecting the planktonic crustacean Daphnia. Questioning the ability to detect and identify microsporidia with conventional microscopic techniques, we applied molecular methods in order to investigate the distribution and co-infection patterns of this parasite among 8 communities of the Daphnia longispina hybrid complex. Eight microsporidian taxa were detected, including 3 that previously had not been characterized genetically. Microsporidian communities from nearby lakes were found to be more similar to each other, apparently due to short distance dispersal via secondary hosts. Moreover, we detected seasonal (but not interannual) changes in microsporidian community structure. With some microsporidia being host-specific, these changes might have resulted from seasonal changes in host taxon and clonal composition. The 2 dominant and closely related parasite species were found mainly in single infections, whereas another pair of related microsporidians was found predominantly in co-infections; suggesting species-level differences in the ability to colonize infected hosts. By applying molecular methods, we were not only able to unambiguously identify parasite taxa but also to reveal multiple infections that otherwise would have remained undetected. Given the increased level of accuracy and sensitivity, we highly recommend molecular approaches in future parasite surveys of Daphnia infections.

In this Study, steady-state river water quality and lake eutrophication models are solved using dynamic programming algorithms to find the nutrient removal rates for eutrophication control during dry season. The kinetic cycle of chlorophyll-a, phosphorus and nitrogen for a complete-mixed lake is considered in the optimization framework. The Newton-iterative technique is adopted to solve the nonlinear equations for the steady-state lake eutrophication model. The optimization framework is applied to Cheng-Ching Lake in southern Taiwan. several nutrient loading scenarios for eutrophication control are studied. Optimization results for nutrient removal rates and corresponding wastewater treatment capacities of each reach of the Kao-Ping River define the least cost approach to lake eutrophication control. A natural purification method, structural free water surface wetland, is also Suggested to save more investment and improve river water quality at the same time. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of linear and cubic spline methods of interpolating lake water column profiles	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Two commonly used methods of interpolating lake water column profiles-two-point linear interpolation and cubic spline interpolation-were compared, and their relative performance assessed using "leave-k-out" cross-validation. Artificial "pseudo-gaps" of various sizes were created in measured water column profiles of four representative variables (water temperature, oxygen concentration, total phosphorus concentration, and chloride concentration) from the Lake of Zurich by removing measured data from the profiles. The pseudo-gaps were then filled using each of the two interpolation methods. The performance of each interpolation method was assessed based on the root mean square error, mean bias error, and maximum absolute bias error of the interpolated values in relation to the original measured values. The performance of the interpolation methods varied with depth, season, and profile shape. When the profiles were homogeneous both methods performed well, but when the profiles were heterogeneous, linear interpolation generally performed better than cubic spline interpolation. Although the data generated by cubic spline interpolation were less biased than those generated by linear interpolation, there were more instances of extreme errors. The results of this study suggest that linear interpolation is generally preferable to cubic spline interpolation for filling data gaps in measured lake water column profiles.

Juvenile Alligator Gar Movement Patterns in a Disconnected Floodplain Habitat in Southeast Missouri	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Telemetry is an extremely useful technique used to study movement patterns of fishes to gain insight into life history. This is especially important when dealing with species of conservation concern, such as the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula). Alligator gar, despite dwindling populations or presumed extirpation across much of its native range, have received minimal attention in the literature. This study sought to evaluate movement patterns of juvenile alligator gar reintroduced to a historic, now disconnected, floodplain of the Mississippi River. Nineteen alligator gar fitted with radio transmitters were stocked into Mingo National Wildlife Refuge during May 2007 and tracked for 1 y. Over the course of the evaluation, 34.9 (SE = 5.1) locations per individual gar were recorded and three distinct movement patterns emerged. Thirteen alligator gar (Groups A and B) exhibited site fidelity throughout the study while five alligator gar (Group C) showed highly variable movement patterns; at times showing site fidelity, then exhibiting long-distance movements. When exhibiting site fidelity, alligator gar occupied small areas of Monopoly Marsh or Ditch 5 (Group A: 12.9 +/- 6.0 ha, Group B: 4.8 +/- 4.9 ha, Group C: 11.8 +/- 8.0 ha). Our study demonstrated telemetry of juvenile alligator gar is feasible, various movement patterns (i.e., site fidelity or long-distance movement) exist, and future stockings of juvenile alligator gar are likely to show site fidelity to the area in which they are released.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2013	169	2					336	344																WOS:000338206900007

Time-series analysis identified two components in the P. agardhii biomass dynamics: (1) a significant decreasing trend in P. agardhii biomass (65% of the overall variance) and (2) a residual component without significant seasonal periodicity. A path-analysis model was built to determine the main factors controlling the P. agardhii dynamics over the period studied. The model explained 66% of P. agardhii biomass changes. The decreasing trend in P. agardhii biomass was significantly related to a decrease in the PO43- concentration resulting from an improved treatment of the incoming watershed surface water. The residual component was related to zooplankton dynamics (cyclopoid abundances), supporting the hypothesis of a top-down control of P. agardhii, but only when the biomass was low. Forty-nine percent of the variability in the microcystin (MC) concentration (min:< 0.1 mu g equivalent MC-LR L-1; max: 7.4 mu g equivalent MC-LR L-1) could be explained by changes in the P. agardhii biomass. The highest toxin content was observed when P. agardhii biomass was the lowest, which suggests changes in the proportion of microcystin-producing and -nonproducing subpopulations and/or the physiological status of cells.					; Catherine, Arnaud/A-1305-2009; Bernard, Cecile/AAE-4242-2022; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019	GOT, Patrice/0000-0001-7528-0770; Bernard, Cecile/0000-0001-7032-3989; Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUL	2008	65	1					61	73		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00494.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00494.x								18462398					WOS:000256717200006

Here we study the runoff response and related rill erosion after installing drainage ditches and assess the effects of stone bunds in north Ethiopia. Three different land management systems were studied in 10 cropland catchments around Wanzaye during the rainy season of 2013: (1) the exclusive use of drainage ditches (locally called feses), (2) the exclusive use of stone bunds, and (3) a mixture of both systems. Stone bunds are an effective soil and water conservation technique, making the land more resistant against on-site erosion, and allowing feses to be installed at a larger angle with the contour. The mean rill volumes for the 10 studied cropland catchments during the rainy season of 2013 was 3.73 +/- 4.20m(3)ha(-1) corresponding to a soil loss of 5.72 +/- 6.30 ton ha(-1). The establishment of feses causes larger rill volumes (R=0.59, N=10), although feses are perceived as the best way to avoid soil erosion when no stone bunds are present. The use of feses increases event-based runoff coefficients (RCs) on cropland from c. 5% to values up to 39%. Also, a combination of low stone bund density and high feses density results in a higher RC, whereas catchments with a high stone bund density and low feses density have a lower RC. Peak runoff discharges decrease when stone bund density increases, whereas feses density is positively related to the peak runoff discharge. A multiple linear relation in which both feses and stone bund densities are used as explanatory variable, performs best in explaining runoff hydrograph peakedness (R-2=83%).

Kenya, East Africa: a landscape-ecological perspective based on multi-proxy lake-sediment influxes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The degree to which different lakes within a landscape respond coherently (in unison) to external drivers such as climate change and soil development is uncertain. Presentation of multi-proxy, geochemical and palaeoecological data from individual lakes in the form of fluxes minimizes distortions resulting from variable sedimentation rates and changes in sediment composition. We use the accumulation rates of magnetic minerals, total organic C and N, terrestrial and aquatic biomarkers, graminoid epidermis, pollen, green algae, diatoms and diatom C in four small lakes, situated between 2350 and 4595 in a.s.l. on the NE flank of Mt. Kenya, East Africa, to reconstruct changes in C cycling over the last 38 ka. The results conflict with earlier models of landscape and lake development, showing: (1) that glacial-interglacial changes in vegetation cannot be interpreted as simple, altitudinal shifts in the modern vegetation belts; and (2) that limnological changes were not coherent. Rapid variations in climate, water level, erosion and nutrient input overwhelmed long-term, successional trends in lake sedimentation and C accumulation since the Last Glacial Maximum. The results also reveal previously unrecognized features of the palaeoenvironmental record, such as the rapid degradation of organic matter in diatoms and the occurrence of a productive, fire-prone montane grassland during the highly seasonal, monsoonal climate of the Lateglacial and early Holocene.

J	Ip, YK; Tay, ASL; Lee, KH; Chew, SF				Ip, YK; Tay, ASL; Lee, KH; Chew, SF			Strategies for surviving high concentrations of environmental ammonia in the swamp eel Monopterus albus	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												The swamp eel Monopterus albus lives in muddy ponds, swamps, canals, and rice fields in the tropics. It encounters high concentrations of environmental ammonia (HEA) during dry seasons or during agricultural fertilization in rice fields. This study aimed at determining the tolerance of M. albus to environmental ammonia and at elucidating the strategies that it adopts to defend against ammonia toxicity in HEA. In the laboratory, M. albus exhibited very high environmental ammonia tolerance; the 48-, 72-, and 96-h median lethal concentrations of total ammonia at pH 7.0 and 28 degreesC were 209.9, 198.7, and 193.2 mM, respectively. It was apparently incapable of actively excreting ammonia against a concentration gradient. In addition, it did not detoxify ammonia to urea, the excretion of which would lead to a loss of nitrogen and carbon, during ammonia loading. The high tolerance of M. albus to HEA was attributable partially to its exceptionally high tolerance to ammonia at the cellular and subcellular levels. During the 144 h of exposure to 75 mM NH4Cl at pH 7.0, the ammonia contents in the muscle, liver, brain, and gut of M. albus reached 11.49, 15.18, 6.48, and 7.51 mumol g(-1), respectively. Such a capability allowed the accumulation of high concentrations of ammonia in the plasma (3.54 mumol mL(-1)) of M. albus exposed to HEA, which would reduce the net influx of exogenous ammonia. Subsequent to the buildup of internal ammonia levels, M. albus detoxified ammonia produced endogenously to glutamine. The glutamine contents in the muscle and liver reached 10.84 and 17.06 mumol g(-1), respectively, after 144 h of exposure to HEA, which happened to be the highest known for fish. Unlike urea, the storage of glutamine in the muscle during ammonia loading allowed its usage for anabolic purposes when the adverse environmental condition subsides. Glutamine synthetase activity increased significantly in the liver and gut (2.8- and 1.5-fold, respectively) of specimens exposed to HEA for 144 h. These results suggest that the liver was the main site of ammonia detoxification and the gut was more than a digestive/absorptive organ in M. albus. Monopterus albus did not undergo a reduction in amino acid catabolism during the first 24 h of ammonia exposure. However, assuming a total inhibition of excretion of endogenous ammonia, there was a deficit of - 312 mmol N between the reduction in nitrogenous excretion ( 3,360 mmol N) and the retention of nitrogen ( 3,048 mmol N) after 72 h of aerial exposure. The deficit became much greater after 144 h, reaching a value of - 3,243 mumol N. These results suggest that endogenous ammonia production in M. albus was suppressed in order to prevent the newly established internal steady state concentration of ammonia from rising to an intolerable level after an extended period of exposure to HEA.					; Ip, Yuen/H-8041-2012; Chew, Shit/I-2248-2012; Ip, Yuen Kwong/H-8041-2012	Chew, Shit Fun/0000-0003-4599-5817; Ip, Yuen Kwong/0000-0001-9124-7911													1522-2152	1537-5293				MAY-JUN	2004	77	3					390	405		10.1086/383510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/383510								15286913					WOS:000223403300005

They occur in large amounts in Estany Redo (340 and 430 ng m(-2) month(-1) for endosulfans and gamma-HCH, respectively), reflecting the impact of agricultural activities in southern Europe. This lake showed also the highest proportion of the more labile endosulfan isomers (alpha and beta = 82%) whereas only the most recalcitrant species, endosulfan sulfate, was found in Ovre Neadalsvatn. In contrast, the OC whose use is now banned exhibit a more uniform geographic distribution with deposition fluxes of 31-40, 30-100, and 1.4-15 ng m(-2) month(-1) for alpha-HCH, PCBs, and HCB. Both compounds of present and past use exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with higher deposition in the warm periods,which is consistent with enhanced volatilization at higher temperatures. In the case of the agricultural pesticides it may also reflect higher use during application periods. The OC distributions in the atmospheric deposition of the three sites are rather uniform and highly enriched in compounds with volatilities larger than 0,0032 Pa. However, more than 90% of these compounds are not retained in the lake waters or sediments. Comparison of OC composition in atmospheric and sedimentary deposition evidences a selective trapping of the less volatile compounds. Trapping efficiencies increase at decreasing air temperatures of the lacustrine systems.

Does variation in the intensity and duration of predation drive evolutionary changes in senescence?	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The evolutionary theory of senescence predicts that increased rates of extrinsic mortality select for faster declines in fertility and survival with age. One predicted mechanism is that increased mortality favours alleles that enhance fitness early in life at the expense of survival or reproduction later in life (antagonistic pleiotropy). We tested these predictions in natural populations of Daphnia ambigua from lakes that vary in the severity and duration of fish predation. Daphnia are found in lakes with (i) anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) that migrate between marine and freshwater, (ii) permanent landlocked alewife and (iii) no alewife. Daphnia are rare year-round in landlocked lakes' and are seasonally eliminated from the water column in anadromous lakes' due to the very strong predatory impact of anadromous alewife on populations of zooplankton. Previous work has also shown that intense seasonal bouts of predation by anadromous alewife has selected for increased allocation towards growth and reproduction in Daphnia found in lakes with anadromous alewife. Such variation in the risk of mortality and the expression of life-history traits early in life provides the raw materials to test the evolutionary theory of ageing. We reared replicate populations of Daphnia from all three lake types and quantified lifetime rates of offspring production and intrinsic survival. We found no differences in age-related declines in fertility or survival. Daphnia from anadromous lakes produced significantly more offspring throughout their lifetime despite no differences in life span or in the number of reproductive bouts compared with Daphnia from lakes with landlocked and no alewife. The lack of divergence in ageing contradicts the prediction that elevated mortality rates drive evolutionary shifts in ageing. We reconcile these results by considering the predictions of theoretical frameworks that incorporate feedbacks associated with increased mortality such as density- and condition-dependent processes. Our results, which are better explained by a consideration of these processes, thus call for a greater consideration of models that more explicitly consider the ecology of focal organisms.

J	Eberth, DA; Britt, BB; Scheetz, R; Stadtman, KL; Brinkman, DB				Eberth, DA; Britt, BB; Scheetz, R; Stadtman, KL; Brinkman, DB			Dalton Wells: Geology and significance of debris-flow-hosted dinosaur bonebeds in the Cedar Mountain Formation (Lower Cretaceous) of eastern Utah, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Lower Cretaceous Dalton Wells dinosaur locality, north of Moab, Utah, consists of a 2 in thick, stacked succession of four fossil-rich bonebeds with an estimated collective lateral extent of more than 4000 m(2). To date, 215 m(2) of the bonebeds have been excavated and more than 4200 vertebrate fossil field specimens have been collected. The site occurs at the base of the Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, and lies unconformably on Upper Jurassic strata of the Morrison Formation. The age of the assemblage is tentatively accepted as Barremian. Nine dinosaur taxa are recognized, making Dalton Wells one of the richest (abundance and diversity) Lower Cretaceous dinosaur localities in the world. The bonebeds are rare examples of fossiliferous subaerial debris flow deposits. At least four flows originated an undetermined distance up-slope from an Early Cretaceous site of dinosaur bone concentration and flowed through the site carrying bones short distances toward an adjacent area of lakes, ponds and wetlands. Host sediments most likely accumulated on the eastward-dipping slopes of a backbulge in a foreland basin. The overall depositional setting was alluvial-lacustrine in a warm-to-hot and seasonally wet-and-dry climate. The consistent expression and location of lacustrine facies in both the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation and the Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation indicate that high rates of subsidence typified the Dalton Wells area both before and after the J-K transition, and further suggest that there was some form of long-term to episodic and localized influence on subsidence. The depositional slope required to generate debris flows may have been established by forebulge crustal flexure, but could also have been established or amplified by the high rates of subsidence that maintained the lacustrine paleoenvironments in the field area. Concretionary deposits in the Yellow Cat Member at Dalton Wells are diagenetic and apparently resulted from groundwater precipitation, likely enhanced by the presence of organics (bones) and lacustrine carbonates. The regional and cross-facies expression of calcretes in the Yellow Cat Member combined with the rarity of pedogenic indicators confirms that they are not paleosols. Mineral precipitation likely occurred as groundwater flow was established in response to foreland basin development. It remains unknown under what specific circumstances animals died and carcasses accumulated prior to being reworked by debris flows. However, the stratigraphic association of seasonally wet-and-dry facies throughout the Yellow Cat Member suggests that drought-induced mortality events were probably common. In a seasonally wet-and-dry environment, debris flows may have been triggered by intense rainfall or seismic events. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) of the Sentinel-3 satellites program is capable of providing images for the monitoring of such waters. Atmospheric correction is a necessary process in order to retrieve the desired surface-leaving radiance signal and several atmospheric correction methods have been developed through the years. However, many of these correction methods require programming language skills, or function as commercial software plugins, limiting their possibility of use by end users. Accordingly, in this study, the free SNAP software provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) was used to evaluate the possible differences between a partial atmospheric correction method accounting for Rayleigh scattering and a full atmospheric correction method (iCOR), applied on Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a shallow, highly eutrophic water reservoir. For the complete evaluation of the two methods, in addition to the comparison of the band reflectance values, chlorophyll (CHL) and cyanobacteria (CI) indices were also calculated and their values were intercompared. The results showed, that although the absolute values between the two correction methods did not coincide, there was a very good correlation between the two methods for both bands' reflectance (r > 0.73) and the CHL and CI indices values (r > 0.95). Therefore, since iCOR correction image processing time is 25 times longer than Rayleigh correction, it is proposed that the Rayleigh partial correction method may be alternatively used for seasonal water monitoring, especially in cases of long time-series, enhancing time and resources use efficiency. Further comparisons of the two methods in other inland water bodies and evaluation with in situ chlorophyll and cyanobacteria measurements will enhance the applicability of the methodology.

Since the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2003, the decreasing diversion of runoff and sediment load of the TOC has an impact on the hydrological connectivity of the river-lake relation. Nonetheless, it lacks complete understanding on the diversion of runoff and sediment load, erosion and deposition amount, and the calculation method of diversion runoff in the TOC. We used remote sensing images, hydrological data, and channel topography to analyze the change in runoff and sediment load, channel morphology, local erosion and deposition amounts. The main results show that: (i) Meander cutoffs of the Lower Jingjiang accelerated the reduction process of the Ouchi River's runoff and sediment load and the increase in the number of dry days. After the impoundment of the TGR, the diversion of sediment load of the TOC was greatly affected, but the decreasing trend of the runoff diversion slowed down. (ii) The morphological change of the inlet zone of Ouchi River is larger than that of Songzi River and Hudu River. The morphological evolution of the inlet area led to the change in the diversion of runoff and sediment load of the TOC. (iii) In the dry season, the water level drop in the inlet zone of the TOC leads to a decrease in the diversion discharge. Therefore, considering the water level drop and channel width adjustment in the inlet zone, five empirical formulae for the diversion discharge of the five hydrological stations in the TOC are proposed. These empirical formulae can be used as a short-term forecast for future changes in the hydrologic regime and the dynamics of the Jingjiang-Dongting Lake relation.					wang, dan/JPX-0483-2023; Li, Zhiwei/O-2351-2015	Li, Zhiwei/0000-0002-2870-7265														2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3479	10.3390/w14213479	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213479													WOS:000881589600001

The paper zooms into a case study of the inhabited RAMSAR area of Boeng Chhmar with its five floating villages, which are dispersed along seasonal waterways. Boeng Chhmar is one of the richest symbiotic habitats in the world and its inhabitants completely rely on the flooded forest's natural cycles for settling, subsistence fishing, and forest-gathering activities. From two opposite landscape transformation processes, Khmer indigenous practices and State development procedures, the paper unravels the logics of settling, coexistence, and contestation. On the one hand, local daily practices are embedded in seasonal floods and forest lifecycles, coexisting, and reconfiguring the inhabited wild for subsistence living. On the other hand, State development through history has centered on (de)-(re)forestation and modern landscape construction for commercially exploitative practices. Forest logging and large-scale fishing lots extracted enormous quantities of natural resources and compromised the health and natural regenerative capacity of the ecological system. This also undermined the ago-old legacy of inhabitant's ways of settling in and with the landscape. Today, State operations face challenges from both nature itself and cultural resistance. The findings for the paper are based on multi-scalar interpretive mapping. The tracing of morpho-typologies and landscape transformation processes allows multiple narratives to be translated into spatial terms. The coexistence and contestation in Boeng Chhmar and the Tonle Sap can provide spatial insights into contemporary forest and water urbanisms, especially concerning local material cultural practices and landscape transformation.

Based on GMS (Groundwater Modeling System) software, the equivalent porous media model was used to simulate the transport of total nitrogen under different conditions in the study area. Two years of field monitoring data in the study area provided the input for the modeling. The SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) model was used to divide the study area into sub-basins. The initial concentration flux index W is first introduced in the equivalent porous medium model to calculate the initial concentration. The simulation results showed the difference between the simulated and monitored values of total nitrogen concentration was between 20% and 40% in 22.2% of the cases, and less than 20% in 66.7% of the cases, indicating that the solute transport model has good applicability in the Huixian Wetland. Parameter sensitivity analysis showed that fertilizer application was the main factor influencing total nitrogen. A 25% reduction in fertilizer application reduced total nitrogen emissions by 31.5% in sub-basin S3 and 22.5% in sub-basin S4. These reductions were greater than the abatement effect of changing land cover and managing river pollution. The pollution plume of total nitrogen was reduced by 38.5% in the southern part of sub-basin S3 (Mudong Lake) and by 40.2% in the western part of sub-basin S4 (Blacksmithing Village). The average concentration was reduced by 2.04 mg/L and 1.22 mg/L, respectively. This study shows that reasonable control of double-season rice nitrogen fertilizer application and appropriate land cover modification can help reduce total nitrogen emissions from wetlands in the Li River watershed and ensure the sustainable development of the local economy and groundwater.

To investigate the interaction between the spatial differences in the zooplankton community structure, aquatic parameters, and land use patterns in the Lake Chen Yao complex (Lake Chen Yao and Lake Feng Sha), we assessed them in four seasons from October 2020 to August 2021. The results showed that the zooplankton density and biomass of Lake Chen Yao were higher than the latter. The results of Pearson correlation and RDA analysis revealed that electrical conductivity (EC), Chlorophyll a (Chl.a), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH were the main environmental factors affecting the zooplankton community structure in the two lakes. The nutrient content of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were significantly higher in Lake Chen Yao, and there was a considerable relationship with the distribution of land use patterns around the two lakes. The land use patterns were the main reason for the difference in water quality and thus the spatial variation in the characteristics of the zooplankton communities in the two lakes.

Biological control as a management tool is frequently implemented to reduce the population size, adverse ecological impacts, and dispersal of invasive species. The efficacy of biological control measures in managing the Perccottus glenii population was assessed in four small lakes of Lithuania. The biocontrol was carried out by introducing the native piscivorous fishes Esox lucius and Perca fluviatilis into the invaded water bodies for two successive reproductive seasons. The stocking of these fishes led to an instant reduction in P. glenii abundances, and the outcome of the repeated stocking was complete disappearance of the species from the water bodies investigated. Our study proves that native predator fishes can be successfully used for eradicating well-established P. glenii populations in small eutrophic lakes. We hope the current study results will contribute to developing risk-commensurate methodologies for the control of invasive P. glenii populations in small water bodies.

The structure and significance of early Holocene laminated lake sediments in the Faiyum Depression (Egypt) with special reference to diatoms	DIATOM RESEARCH												Lake Qarun lies in the Egyptian Faiyum Depression and is the modern remnant of a much larger Holocene lake. Variations in water level occurred during the Holocene as a result of palaeoclimate changes and, since ca. 4000 BP, there have been hydrological interventions. Past lake levels have been inferred from the locations of archaeological sites, former beaches and exposed lake sediments, but there is no continuous Holocene palaeolimnogical record for the lake. To explore the potential of this record, three sediment cores (10.4-21.4 m long) were collected from terrestrial locations on the southern margin of the lake in 2008. The basal sections of all three cores consisted of thinly laminated diatom marl sediments overlying coarse sand. The nature of these laminations was investigated in thin sections from two cores (QARU9 and 10). Quantitative very high-resolution diatom analysis revealed seasonal succession patterns of Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus species within diatom-rich laminae. Elemental microprobe analysis of one thin section (QARU10) confirmed the presence of alternating Ca- and Si-rich laminae. The results indicate annually deposited sediment sequences with seasonality signals provided by microlayers of diatoms, calcite and clastic material. According to diatom counting, mean varve thicknesses equated to 6.0 (QARU9) and 9.4 (QARU10) annual diatom laminae accumulated cm(-1). Radiocarbon dates from a third core (adjacent to QARU9) indicated that the QARU9 thin section material was bracketed between 8693 and 9935 cal BP. Diatom microstratigraphy was used to infer seasonality in varve forming processes. Gross sediment stratigraphy indicated that varve forming conditions had persisted for > 1500 years. The presence of early Holocene varved sediments in palaeo-Lake Qarun provides an exceptional palaeoenvironmental archive for northeast Africa.

This study presents new mineralogical, sedimentological, and micropaleontological data from the Jaguel (Late Maastrichtian-Early Danian) and Roca (Danian) formations, located in the eastern sector of Pellegrini Lake, Rio Negro province, Republica Argentina. According to the physical characteristics and the age of the sediments that conform these formations, two siliciclastic lithofacies and a carbonate one were recognized, they are named: Maastrichtian grayish yellow calcareous mudstones, Danian olive gray calcareous mudstones, and Danian carbonates. The rocks which constitutes siliciclastic lithofacies were classified as allochemical mudstones and the mineralogy is characterized by high proportions of clay minerals and, to a lesser extent, calcite. The clay mineral association is dominated by a random (R0) I/S mixed-layers (70-90% Sm) accompanied by lower proportions of illite and kaolinite. The mineralogy and the microfabric of the mudstones reflect that these sediments have not been affected significantly by diagenesis. Clay minerals would be of detrital origin and the predominance of the highly smectitic I/S along all sections would be associated with an active volcanism coming from the western magmatic arc, located in the Neuquen Basin during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. Micropalaeontological analyses confirmed the presence of Cretaceous-Paleogene transition in the Jaguel Formation beds. The calcareous nannofossils allowed to relate changes in the the mineralogical associations along the K/P transition. In this way, it was possible to detect an increase in kaolinite content close to the K/P boundary (>10%), that decreases towards higher positions of the Danian, which could indicate a warmer and wetter climate during this interval, that it would tend to be drier with seasonal conditions in the late Danian. The Maastrichtian calcareous nannofossil assemblages suggest oligotrophic environments and a well stratified photic zone, nevertheless, in some horizons, the nannoflora is abundant with lower richness which would indicate more restricted marine conditions.																			0718-7106						2012	39	3					511	540		10.5027/andgeoV39n3-a08	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV39n3-a08													WOS:000313418600008

Adaptation of a radar-based river ice mapping technology to the Nunavik context	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												With increasing signs of a warming climate in the Arctic, local Inuit authorities in Nunavik are preoccupied by the potential consequences of these changes to the ice regime of lakes and rivers, and therefore to the safety of the communities. The main objective of this study is to support the Kativik Regional Government (KRG) ice monitoring program by adapting a basic radar satellite ice mapping technology for the area of the Koksoak River near the village of Kuujjuaq. The adaptation is based on a four-step process: information gathering and awareness raising, planning and design, implementation, and validation. Workshops were conducted within the community to acquire a good knowledge of the ice processes and of the client needs. The technology was adapted to this context, and ice maps were produced every week during the freezeup and breakup seasons and distributed through the Web and as printed versions. Validation was achieved through ground photographs, aerial surveys, and field measurements. Based on all validation samples, overall accuracy is estimated at 61%. When excluding the samples containing drifting frazil pans, overall accuracy increases to 76%. Improvements to the radar mapping process are necessary for conditions involving floating frazil pans and during snowmelt. Students from the local high school were involved in the entire process.

Seasonal variation in viral-induced mortality of bacterioplankton in the water column of a large mesotrophic lake (Lake Biwa, Japan)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant in aquatic systems, yet knowledge of virus-bacteria interactions in thermally stratified water columns of large lakes is limited. We explored the possible factors that affect viral abundance, infection rate, and the relative importance of viral lysis to heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) grazing as a mortality factor of bacterioplankton in the upper (euphotic zone, 5 m) and deeper (aphotic zone, 50 m) layers of the large mesotrophic Lake Biwa, Japan. Data obtained for a full seasonal cycle indicated that bacterial abundance was the best predictor (r(2) = 0.85) of viral abundance (range 1.0 x 10(10) to 4.1 x 10(10) viruses l(-1)), yielding an average virus:bacteria ratio of 8.2 +/- 1.3 (SD). Variation in the frequency of visibly infected cells (range 1.8 to 4.1 %) was largely accounted for by the linear combination of bacterial production and HNF abundance (r(2) = 0.81, p < 0.001, n = 24). The percentage of daily bacterial production destroyed by viruses was estimated to be high (52.7 +/- 16.2 %) in the upper layer during the stratification period, which was on average 3.0-fold greater than the percentage of bacterial production consumed by HNF in that layer. In contrast, the corresponding value in the deeper layer was moderate (13.6 +/- 5.2 %), being 0.6-fold lower than the percentage of bacterial production consumed by HNF. Our data suggest that carbon and nutrient flux patterns controlled by viruses and HNF vary with depth in thermally stratified water columns of Lake Biwa.																			0948-3055	1616-1564					2010	58	3					249	259		10.3354/ame01381	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01381													WOS:000275496100004

MAGIC method for subnanomolar orthophosphate determination in freshwater	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												A freshwater magnesium hydroxide coprecipitation method (MAGIC) has been developed to accurately and reproducibly determine low (nanomolar to subnanomolar) soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in freshwater. The method allows investigation of phosphorus distributions and cycling for systems in which SRP is below the detection limits of conventional methods. In natural waters, both inorganic and organic forms of P are coprecipitated; hence the method is essentially a preconcentration rather than a separation technique. Quantification of SRP on dissolved MAGIC precipitates follows a modified version of the standard molybdenum blue colorimetric method, using a spectrophotometer with similar to 0.1 milliabsorbance (mAbs) noise. Detection limit is 0.15 nM, improving on typical conventional colorimetric methods by a factor of similar to 50, with precision (RSD of triplicates) of similar to 10% at the 1 nM SRP level, 10% at <= 0.5 nM, and 4% to 7% at >1 nM. Considerable method development was necessary to eliminate or correct for multiple interferences, including a novel finding of potential interference by colored dissolved organic matter, and to optimize recovery, precision, and detection limit. The method was applied to filtered, frozen samples from western Lake Superior, showing that SRP concentrations are characterized by limited seasonal variability, largely uniform vertical distribution, and near-bottom enrichment. Concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 10.9 nM SRP, representing similar to 10% of the total dissolved phosphorus pool. MAGIC is an easily employed analytical method appropriate for measurement of very low SRP in lakes and rivers.					; anagnostou, eleni/AAH-2618-2021	Anagnostou, Eleni/0000-0002-7200-4794; 													1541-5856					JAN	2008	6						64	74		10.4319/lom.2008.6.64	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2008.6.64													WOS:000253602000008
J	Penny, D				Penny, D			The Holocene history and development of the Tonle Sap, Cambodia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Tonle Sap, the 'Great Lake' of central Cambodia, is the central component of wetland ecosystems in the lower Mekong River basin, and is of enormous conservation value. The lake's unusual hydraulic relationship with the Mekong River, and its consequent sensitivity to monsoon variability, makes the Tonle Sap sensitive to climate change. Exploring the dynamics and development of this system under different climate regimes of the past offers a perspective on possible future impacts, which is critical for sound management. Biostratigraphic and sedimentological data derived from cores of lake sediment indicate that during the period > 7000 to ca. 5500 C-14 years Before Present the lake was less variable than present in terms of depth during the annual cycle of flood, and may have been strongly influenced by saline tidal waters associated with higher-than-present seas levels. As regional environments became drier and more seasonal in the late Holocene, more sediment was re-suspended during the increasingly marked dry season lake level minimum, lowering the effective sediment accumulation rate. Contrary to current interpretations of the history of the lake and associated wetland ecosystems, the data presented here imply that regional hydraulic connections between the lake and the Mekong River existed from at least the early Holocene.

Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Transport in the Surface-Mixed Layer of the Louisiana Shelf in Northern Gulf of Mexico	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Rivers and wetlands are a major source of terrestrial derived carbon for coastal ocean margins. This results in a net loss of terrestrial carbon into the shelf water and their subsequent transport to interior ocean basin. This study investigates the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface-mixed layer of Louisiana Shelf in northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) adjacent to the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) and Barataria Bay (BB), which represent contrasting net land gain and net land loss areas in this region. DIC samples were collected, in conjunction with short-lived radium isotopes Ra-224 (t(1/2) = 3.66 days) and Ra-223 (t(1/2) = 11.43 days) samples during June and September 2019, to quantify shelf transport of DIC in the surface-mixed layer during period of high and low river flow, respectively. Radium distribution implied shelf mixing rates of 140-6,759 and 63-2,724 m(2) s(-1) for WLD and BB regions, respectively, with more than tenfold decrease in rates between the two seasons. Net shelf transport of DIC was found to be highest for the WLD region in June, highlighting the importance of freshwater discharge in exporting DIC. An upscaling of our study for the entire Louisiana Shelf indicates that 1.54-20.19 x 10(9) mol C d(-1) transported in June 2019 and 0.34-8.12 x 10(9) mol C d(-1) in the form of DIC was exported across the shallow region of the shelf during high and low river flow seasons, representing an important source of DIC to the NGOM.					; Ou, Yanda/GZL-7658-2022; Maiti, Kanchan/E-1936-2013; Xue, Z.

Covariation patterns of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in hypertrophic shallow lakes	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The aim of this work was to assess the temporal patterns in the community composition of phytoplankton (PCC) and bacterioplankton (BCC) in two interconnected and hypertrophic Pampean shallow lakes in Argentina. Factors shaping their community dynamics and community temporal covariations were also analysed. We performed 4 years of seasonal samplings (2012-2016) and communities were studied by the Utermohl approach (PCC) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing (BCC). We found marked seasonal variations in both communities and inter-annual variations with decreasing microbial community similarities during the study. We also observed covariation in community-level dynamics among PCC and BCC within and between shallow lakes. The within-lake covariations remained positive and significant, while controlling for the effects of intrinsic (environmental) and extrinsic (temporal and meteorological) factors, suggesting a community coupling mediated by intrinsic biotic interactions. Algal-bacterial associations between different taxa of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton within each lake were also found. PCC was mainly explained by pure regional extrinsic (17-21%) and intrinsic environmental (8-9%) factors, while BCC was explained by environmental (8-10%) and biotic interactions with phytoplankton (7-8%). Our results reveal that the influence of extrinsic regional factors can be channeled to bacterioplankton through both environmental (i.e. water temperature) and phytoplankton effects.					; Huber, Paula/AAA-7509-2021	Reissig, Mariana/0000-0001-8333-5209; Sagua, Mara/0000-0003-0884-1288; Huber, Paula/0000-0002-5411-7736													0168-6496	1574-6941				NOV	2020	96	11							fiaa161	10.1093/femsec/fiaa161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaa161								32816009					WOS:000593018400005

Seventy four and 56 transects were examined in 14,764 ha of land in 2015 (wet season) and 2016 (dry season), respectively. Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling model was employed. The encounter rate, detection probability, expected cluster size and density were parameters for estimation. Hazard rate key (sigma =0.3), detection function g(x)=1-exp[-(x/sigma) <^>(-beta)], x <= w was selected for analysis. Cluster analysis based on exact sizes was computed by regression of log(s(i)) on g(x(i)). The minimum Akaike Information Criterion was chosen during estimator selection. The result showed that the cluster size of cranes during the wet season in wetland and farmland habitats regression estimate were Cwi=0.73+0.16*xi; and Cfi=0.52+-0.21*xi, respectively. Similarly, in 2016, the regression estimate of wetland and farmland were Cwi=0.16+0.56*xi and Cfi=0.20+-0.34*xi, respectively. During the wet season in 2015, in the wetland habitat, the crane density was estimated 0.21768 +/- 0.82 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 1472 +/- 554.62. Whereas in the farmland, crane density was estimated 0.79921 E-01 +/- 0.13370E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 639. The total density and abundance of Black Crowned Cranes during the wet season in 2015 was estimated. The wet season pooled density estimate was 14.304 cranes per 100 hectares with (% CV = 26.75, df = 50.2, 95%CI= 0.84355E-01=CI = 0.24254) and the population size was estimated to be 2112 cranes with (% CV = 26.75, df = 50.2, 95%CI = 1245=CI = 3581). During the dry season, in 2016, the crane density was estimated 0.3625 +/- 0.6958E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 2452 +/- 470.65. In the farmland, the cranes density was estimated 0.13904 +/- 0.14809E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 1112 +/- 118.44. The dry season pooled density estimate was 24.142 cranes per 100 hectares with (%CV=13.62, df = 164.02, 95%CI = 0.18473=CI= 0.31550) and the population was estimated to be 3564 cranes with (%CV=13.62, df = 164.02, 95%CI = 2727=CI = 4658). In conclusion, the cluster size of cranes in wetland and farmland habitat during the dry season showed that the species consisted of a small number of cranes perfamily. However, the wetland habitat was more suitable than the farmland in consisting of larger cluster size and overall population of cranes. Wetland degradation is a threat for cranes.

Our aim was to study the diversity, abundance, and seasonal dynamics of mosquitoes, comparing these two different areas, to screen mosquitoes for West Nile Virus (WNV), an arboviral agent already detected in Portugal, because these areas are populated with abundant avian fauna. Monthly collections of adult mosquitoes were carried out by Centers for Disease Control light-traps with CO2 and by indoor resting collections. Mosquitoes were identified and screened for arboviruses by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction directed toward amplification of a 217-bp fragment of the NS5 gene. Mosquito peak densities were observed in July-August in Comporta and May-June, with a plateau in July-October, in Alqueva. However, densities were far higher in Comporta area (220,821 specimens) than in Alqueva area (9442 specimens), with a clear difference in species distribution, as in Comporta the predominant species was Culex theileri (85%), followed by Aedes caspius (6%), Anopheles atroparvus (4%), and Culex pipiens sensu latu (s.l.) (3%), whereas in Alqueva the predominant species was Cx. pipiens s.l. (56%), followed by An. atroparvus (18%), Cx. theileri (14%), and Culiseta longiareolata (9%). Female mosquitoes (8842 in 175 pools) of the species Ae. caspius, An. atroparvus, Culex mimeticus, Cx. pipiens Sensu latu (s.l.), Cx. theileri, and Culex univittatus were screened and found to be negative for WNV genomic RNA. Although there was no detection of WNV sequences in mosquitoes, vigilance should continue as the circulation of virus has been previously detected more than once in Portugal, in humans, animals, and mosquitoes, and in other surrounding Mediterranean countries.

J	Woodbridge, J; Roberts, N				Woodbridge, Jessie; Roberts, Neil			Linking neo- and palaeolimnology: a case study using crater lake diatoms from central Turkey	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Palaeoenvironmental interpretations from analyses of lake sediment archives are dependent on our understanding of the modern lake environment and the link between neo- and palaeolimnology. Diatom assemblages represent different lake habitats and vary in species composition and abundance on seasonal and annual timescales. These factors, along with mixing at the mud-water interface, alter the information recorded in the sedimentary archive and the resulting interpretation of environmental variables in the past. Nar Golu (central Turkey), a crater lake with annually laminated sediments, is used to investigate the link between modern and palaeo diatom assemblages. Information about the modern diatom population has been gathered through sampling of different lake habitats (1999-2009) and installing seston sediment traps in the water column (2002-2007). The palaeo diatom assemblage has been analysed through annual-resolution percentage counts and biovolume calculations on core sediments (1927-2006), along with identification of sub-annual assemblage changes through microscopic analysis of core thin sections. Comparisons of data collected using these different methods has shown a good correspondence between sediment trap and core results, but revealed that blooms of two diatom species (Nitzschia paleacea and Synedra acus), in each case occurring on average 1 year in five, can have major impacts on percentage calculations and may result in distorted and misleading palaeoenvironmental interpretations. These two species distort the average signal and may bloom for short periods of time as a result of short duration changes in lake water chemistry, such as following fresh-water input from snow melt. Blurring of sedimentary records through mixing at the sediment-water interface can mask the full magnitude of environmental variation and low sampling resolution may fail to capture high amplitude events of short duration.

A total of 10 water samples from two rivers discharging to the lake and 78 water samples of surface and pore brine of Maharlu Lake have been collected from different depths (surface, 20, 50 and 100 cm) of four sampling stations along the lake during a period of lake water-level fluctuation (November 2014-July 2015). To investigate chemical interaction between lake surface water and shallow pore water and to understand the major factors governing chemical composition of Maharlu brine, concentrations of major and minor (boron, bromide and lithium) solutes, pH and total dissolved solids have been measured in collected water samples. Saturation indices of evaporite minerals in collected water samples have been also calculated. The chemical behavior of dissolved solutes and evaporative evolution of the lake brine during a hydrological period have been simulated using PHREEQC. The results of our investigations indicated that chemical composition of lake surface water and pore brine of Maharlu Lake are mainly connected with lake water-level fluctuations and distance from input rivers (and depth), respectively. Hydrochemical investigations and statistical analysis showed that the brines chemistry of Maharlu is mainly controlled by three processes: brine evaporative evolution, dissolution-precipitation and diagenetic evolution of secondary carbonates.					; Bigalke, Moritz/M-6089-2013; Savadjani, Roghayeh/AAD-9616-2020	Zarei, Mehdi/0000-0002-7909-3371; Bigalke, Moritz/0000-0002-6793-6159; Khosravi, Roghayeh/0000-0002-6823-4714; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				FEB	2018	24	1					27	54		10.1007/s10498-018-9329-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-018-9329-y													WOS:000426713200004

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are a family of secondary metabolites known to protect organisms exposed to solar UV radiation. We tested their distribution among several planktonic ciliates bearing Chlorella isolated from an oligo-mesotrophic lake in Tyrol, Austria. In order to test the origin of these compounds, the MAAs were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography in both the ciliates and their symbiotic algae. 2. Considering all Chlorella-bearing ciliates, we found: (i) seven different MAAs (mycosporine-glycine, palythine, asterina-330, shinorine, porphyra-334, usujirene, palythene); (ii) one to several MAAs per species and (iii) qualitative and quantitative seasonal changes in the MAAs (e.g. in Pelagodileptus trachelioides). In all species tested, concentrations of MAAs were always < 1% of ciliate dry weight. 3. Several MAAs were also identified in the Chlorella isolated from the ciliates, thus providing initial evidence for their symbiotic origin. In Uroleptus sp., however, we found evidence for a dietary source of MAAs. 4. Our results suggest that accumulation of MAAs in Chlorella-bearing ciliates represents an additional benefit of this symbiosis and an adaptation for survival in sunlit, UV-exposed waters.

J	Mercier, F; Cazenave, A; Maheu, C				Mercier, F; Cazenave, A; Maheu, C			Interannual lake level fluctuations (1993-1999) in Africa from Topex/Poseidon: connections with ocean-atmosphere interactions over the Indian Ocean	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Water level fluctuations of continental lakes are related to regional to global scale climate changes. Water level fluctuations reflect variations in evaporation and precipitation over the lake area and its catchment area. Over such inland water bodies, the satellite altimetry technique offers both a world-wide coverage and a satisfying accuracy. We present here results of lake level variations of 12 African lakes based on 7 years of Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry data acquired between 1993 and 1999. Among the 12 African lakes presented in this study, three are reservoirs whose level fluctuations are mainly driven by anthropogenic usage of the water. Either closed or open, the nine remaining lakes are sensitive indicators of the climate evolution over Africa during the 1990s. Seasonal signals of each lake are clearly identified and filtered out to focus on the interannual fluctuations. Clear correlated regional variations are reported among the east African lakes: several lakes exhibit a regular level decrease between 1993 and 1997, probably due to intense droughts. However, the most spectacular feature is an abrupt water level rise occurring in late 1997-early 1998 and affecting most of the lakes located within the Rift Valley. This major anomalous pattern, explained by a large excess rainfall anomaly occurring in late 1997, is quantified in both space and time domains through an EOF analysis of the lake level height time series. The spatial distribution of the leading mode of lake level height correlates with the dominant mode of precipitation computed over the same time span, Nevertheless, similar rainfall anomaly, but with lesser intensity, occurred in late 1994 without any noticeable consequence on lake level. The precipitation anomaly appears related to the equatorial Indian Ocean warming reported during the 1997-1998 ENSO event. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Gross primary productivity (GPP) was relatively high, given the poor nutrient conditions in this river. Seasonal variability in net ecosystem production (NEP) was also high, with highest values occurring in the dry season (March-April) when fish biomass and chlorophyll a (both water-column and benthic) levels were greatest (dry-season NEP = 542 mg C m(-2) d(-1), wet-season NEP = 303 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). NEP and algal biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) were higher in lagoons than at river sites, with more pronounced differences between these 2 habitats during the dry season. Strong N limitation was evident. Dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentrations always were <2 mu M and typically were <0.5 mu M. Molar ratios of DIN:SRP (soluble reactive P) varied little seasonally and were always <8. As in other Neotropical aquatic systems, water-column productivity was an important source of organic matter and was >2x benthic productivity, even in shallow regions of the riverine ecosystem. Low nutrient levels combined with high rates of autochthonous productivity in the littoral zone of this river suggest extremely rapid nutrient cycling rates and support the view that the littoral regions may be important in providing the organic matter that maintains secondary production, consistent with the Riverine Productivity Model and other observations in the Orinoco Basin.					; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013; Montoya, Jose/A-6775-2008	Montoya, Jose V./0000-0002-9759-4946; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793; Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; 													0887-3593					MAR	2006	25	1					171	184		10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[171:SVRPIT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[171:SVRPIT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236565400014

These baseline candidates were particulate organic matter (POM), sediment organic matter (SOM), a filterer mussel (Corbicula flumine), and a grazer snail (Bellamya aeruginosa). N-15 values of POM and SOM varied significantly among the sampling seasons, while no significant seasonal variation was observed among the N-15 values of the mussels and snails sampled in different seasons. POM N-15 was correlated with lake water PO4-P, while SOM N-15 was correlated with NO3-N. Mussel N-15 and lake water TN, NO3-N, and PO4-P were significantly correlated as were snail N-15 and TN, TP, and NO3-N. SOM and snails were better bioindicators of the water column nutrient concentration of Lake Poyang. The significant correlations between mussel N-15 and POM, as well as between snail N-15 and SOM, indicated the potential use of these baselines in trophic evaluations in planktonic and benthic food webs in this water-level fluctuating lake.

During the rainy season (April to September), gaseous PCB and HCB concentrations were low due to both scavenging by precipitation and dilution by prevailing southwesterly winds blown from the atmosphere of the South China Sea. In contrast, trace precipitation and prevailing northeasterly winds during the dry season (October to March) resulted in higher gaseous PCB and HCB concentrations. instantaneous air-water exchange fluxes of PCB homologues and HCB were calculated from 22 pairs of air and water samples from Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon. All net fluxes of PCB homologues and HCB in this study are from water to air (net volatilization). The highest net volatile flux observed was + 172 ng m(-2) day(-1) (dichlorobiphenyls) in December, 2003 due to the high wind speed and high dissolved concentration. The PCB homologues and HCB fluxes were significantly governed by dissolved concentrations in Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon. For low molecular weight PCBs (LMW PCBs), their fluxes were also significantly correlated with wind speed. The net PCB and HCB fluxes suggest that the annual sums of 69 PCBs and HCB measured in this study were mainly volatile (57.4 x 10(3) and 28.3 x 10(3) ng m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) and estimated yearly, 1.5 kg and 0.76 kg of PCBs and HCB were emitted from the harbor lagoon surface waters to the ambient atmosphere. The average tPCB flux in this study was about one-tenth of tPCB fluxes seen in New York Harbor and in the Delaware River, which are reported to be greatly impacted by PCBs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dodson, JR; Macphail, MK				Dodson, JR; Macphail, MK			Palynological evidence for aridity events and vegetation change during the Middle Pliocene, a warm period in Southwestern Australia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Meeting on Human Dimensions and Natural Processes in Environmental Change	MAY, 2001	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA					A 110-m-thick sequence of Late Neogene lacustrine silts and clays is sealed under Quaternary cover beds in a Cretaceous meteor crater at Yallalie in semiarid to subhumid southwest Western Australia. Paleomagnetic dating confirms that these sediments accumulated between 3.6 and similar to2.5 Ma. This Middle Pliocene (Piacenzian) interval coincides with a period of pronounced global warming recorded at middle to high latitudes in both hemispheres and plant microfossils preserved at Yallalie include species now confined to temperate and subtropical-tropical rainforest in Australasia as well as taxa that dominate dry sclerophyll forest, woodland, scrub-heath and semiarid vegetation types in northern Southwest Australia today. The region at the present time supports highly diverse xeromorphic heathland, shrubland and woodland, and the data suggests species diversity was richer in the Middle to Late Pliocene. Transient upsurges in the relative abundance of semiarid zone taxa, in particular Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, and halophytic diatoms demonstrate that warm, seasonally wet conditions within and beyond the crater were interrupted by three distinct episodes of aridification around 2.90, 2.59 and 2.56 Ma. How closely the Yallalie sequence mirrors trends in continental climates elsewhere in the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere is as yet unclear. However, we note that the period of record overlaps with initiation of continental glaciation and an increase in the frequency and intensity of climatic fluctuations between 2.8 and 2.6 Ma in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Since the Yallalie and vegetation response appears to be similar to that seen in southeastern Australia during Late Pleistocene glacial maxima, the vegetation patterns suggest alternating cycles of high humidity and aridity analogous to Late Pleistocene glacial-interglacial conditions that were taking place by 2.5 Ma, an observation that ties in well with delta(18)O variations seen in marine cores. The data hint that the frequency of phases of relative aridity increased around 2.6 Ma. When fully analyzed, the high-resolution microfossil record will offer an exceptional opportunity to compare variability in Middle Pliocene terrestrial climates in the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere with analogous records in the northern hemisphere. Examples are the Chinese loess, Lake Baikal in Russia and Pula Maar in Hungary, which are providing important data on orbit-related long-term climatic fluctuations during the Late Neogene and Early Quaternary.

Infection by plerocercoids of Diphyllobothrium lawn and Diphyllobothrium dendriticum occurs in introduced trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and native fish. We determined the prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of seasonal infection and tissue damage produced by Diphyllobothrium spp. in native fish (Percichthys trucha, Odontesthes mauleanum, and Basilichthys australis) and introduced trout (O. mykiss) from Lake Panguipulli, Chile. Prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of D. Latum infection were significantly, greater in trout than they were in native fish. Prevalence and mean abundance were similar in O. mauleanum and P. trucha, but they were greater than those in B. australis. Prevalence and abundance were similar among seasons between sexes for the four hosts. For all host species, except P. trucha, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between host length and the abundance of plerocercoids. Infections in muscle tissue were present in 61% of trout compared with 23% in O. mauleanum and 12% in P. trucha, suggesting a greater risk for human infection when consuming trout. In general, prevalence of infection by D. dendriticum was lower than was D. latum prevalence. Encapsulation of plerocercoids was common and severe in 71% of the trout examined. Only slight encapsulation of plerocercoids was found in the native O mauleanum, and no encapsulation was observed in P. trucha or B. australis. The greater concentration of plerocercoids in the walls of the digestive tract of trout suggests a more-rapid immune response in trout than in native fish. The low frequency of encapsulation of plerocercoids in native fish would mean greater tissue damage in the natives than that observed in the trout because they are free to migrate among the viscera, potentially endangering these native fish populations in regions where Diphyllobothrium spp. are endemic.

In order to manage and maintain the ecosystem in the lakes, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the nutrients as well as the factors affecting the algae growth seasonally. In this study, an ecosystem model based on the genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of the parameters during the model validation was developed to simulate the growth of algae groups (green algae, blue-green algae, and diatom algae) and analyze the principal factors affecting their growth in a eutrophic shallow lake in the inner Hanoi City. The survey of each algal group and other related variables of water quality were conducted from May 2017 to March 2018 to calibrate and verify the developed model. The principal factors affecting the algae growth were evaluated through the functions that limit their growth. Seasonal variation in the production components (including diffusion from sediment, atmosphere, and algae excretion) and consumption (photosynthesis) of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) are also quantified. Moreover, the model developed in this study promises to be a useful tool to simulate the relationship between algae biomass and nutrient concentration, as well as forecasting changes in composition and density of algae in the eutrophic lakes.

With the exception of well-documented early hominin discoveries, the region has previously been overlooked as a wilderness absent of human inhabitation. Such an outlook has fostered various consequences for strategies of legal, research and conservation policy within the regional boundaries of Mursiland in particular. In this paper recent discoveries of megalithic circular platforms and other archaeological remains are introduced against their dynamic local and regional placement within present-day understandings of place. Furthermore, we emphasise the value of a participative archaeology research framework in which accountability is directed towards common ground between multiple ostake-holderso within the design and dissemination of the research agenda. This demonstrates important possibilities for intricate understandings of wilderness and landscape linked to heritage, conservation, development and tourism.

The lagoons were sampled in three periods of the hydrological cycle (beginning and ending of the dry and flooding season of 2005). The feeding guilds were determined through analysis of stomach contents of the most abundant species in the community. Were analyzed 37 species belonging to eight trophic guilds (insectivore, herbivore, omnivore, zooplanktivore, planktivore, detritivore, benthivore and iliophage), whitch varied spatially and temporally. A change in the composition of trophic guilds between the periods and locations was observed, but the number of guilds did not vary for either of them. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variation in the composition of the guilds can be related to many factors, such as alterations in the composition of the community where new species can contribute to the different trophic guilds; and the exploration of more abundant resources in certain periods of the year favoring the presence of some guilds only in some periods.					; Penha, Jerry/D-6238-2013; Mateus, Lucia/H-7964-2015	Mateus, Lucia/0000-0001-5749-9533; Penha, Jerry/0000-0003-4437-092X; 													1676-0603					JAN-MAR	2011	11	1					205	215		10.1590/S1676-06032011000100022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1676-06032011000100022													WOS:000296131000023

The objective is to explore this extreme icy environment, using a variety of techniques to identify the forms and levels of life that exist there. The project is funded by the Russian Federal Service ROSHYDROMET. In the 2009/2010 season, drilling operations were restarted at a depth of 3559 m via new borehole 5G-2, successfully reaching a new depth of approximately 3650 m. New accretion ice, including the inclusion-rich "thermophile-containing" horizon (around 3608 m) was again recovered and will be studied to assess the previous scenario and findings. In 2010/2011, the drill will carefully continue to deepen the borehole leaving a 10- to 15-m ice cork and will in season 2011/2012 enter the lake, allowing water to rise up dozens of meters within borehole 5G-2 and subsequently freeze. During the same or following season (2012/2013), borehole 5G-2 will be redrilled to acquire rapidly frozen lake water for complex investigations. In the following season, 2013/2014, a special set of strictly decontaminated biophysical instruments, developed at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, will be lowered into the water body, with a battery of ocean observatory sensors, cameras, fluorimeters-spectrometers, and special water samplers on board several submersible titan modules. Such activities are in line with environmental stewardship in the exploration of unique aquatic environments under the Antarctic ice sheet.					; Lukin, Valeriy/N-1147-2015	Bulat, Sergey/0000-0002-2574-882X; Lukin, Valeriy/0000-0003-1726-7361													0065-8448		978-0-87590-482-5				2011	192						187	197		10.1029/2010GM000951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010GM000951	10.1029/GM192												WOS:000290418300011

A major effect of climate change is likely to be alterations in hydrologic cycles and changes in water availability. This chapter reports the use of global climate models (GCM's) and application of a hydrological model to investigate agricultural water resources' sensitivity to climate change in the Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia. Projected changes in precipitation and temperature in the basin for two future seasons (2046-2065 and 2080-2100) were analyzed using outputs from fifteen GCMs. A historical-modification procedure was used to downscale large scale outputs from four GCM models to watershed-scale climate data. The study then investigated how these changes in temperature and precipitation might translate into changes in streamflow and other hydrological components using SWAT model. We interpret the different aspects of the hydrological responses to imply that changes in runoff and other hydrological variables could be significant, even though the GCMs do not agree on the direction of the change indicating high uncertainty.

Loss of seasonal variability in a lake resulting from copper sulfate algaecide treatment	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Vertical profiles of selected biogeochemical parameters were measured temporally in two lakes to help understand the influence of the additions of CuSO4 to control algal growth. Our working hypothesis is that the temporal variability of biogeochemical parameters in the treated lake will be less than in the untreated one. The study lakes are in the southern portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Hawk Island, a groundwater fed lake, was treated with periodic additions of CuSO4 It has a large lake to watershed area ratio and its land-use is characterized by a public park that has a combination of woods and grassland with fertilizer additions. Muskrat Lake has a smaller lake to watershed ratio, is a flow-through lake, and in a dominantly agricultural landscape. Temporal measurements include total dissolved copper, pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, percent aromaticity, total dissolved nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorous. A novel aspect of the data is a set of samples taken just after a major rain event. The results show that lakes have some similarities (e.g., same pH's and temperatures and are well mixed). However, there are differences in some biogeochemical (e.g., DO) and physical (e.g., turbidity) parameters that can be observed as a function of sampling time and response to the rain events. Physical and biogeochemical parameters have less seasonal variability in Hawk Island Lake than in Muskrat Island Lake. The impact of the rain event (i.e., biogeochemical change and recovery) was different for each lake which is attributed in part to the influence of the CuSO4 addition as well as to the difference in the lake hydrology. These results support the working hypothesis by showing that addition of the algaecide CuSO4 changes the biogeochemical structure of a lake, and that with the loss of algae, seasonal variations in biogeochemical parameters are reduced. While CuSO4 additions may be perceived as beneficial in reducing or eliminating algal blooms, it may come at a cost to other lake processes. The consequences of this dampening are currently not well understood. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Whither an International Issue: The Columbia River Treaty, the Canada/US Border, and the Curious Case of Libby, MT	JOURNAL OF BORDERLANDS STUDIES												International borders are an integral component of multilevel governance theorizing in other parts of the world, mainly Europe. This is seldom the focus for theorizing or explicating events and relationships at North American borders. This is particularly clear at the Canada/US border where local jurisdictions are often excluded from international discussions. This article examines the efforts of one Montana legislator to gain compensation for losses incurred under the Columbia River Treaty and the creation of the binational Lake Koocanusa reservoir. The Treaty established a series of dams to control seasonal flooding and provide inexpensive hydropower. September 16, 2014 was the 50-year anniversary of the Treaty and first possible date by which either country could give notice to withdraw; neither party wants to withdraw but both are interested in renegotiating certain components. This article argues that the Treaty shifts between being viewed as a domestic and international issue obscuring the role of the local. Scholars need to employ multilevel governance and the concept of the region in our theorizing of borders to incorporate local level actors in what is largely an international political domain. Understanding how power operates at and through the border, at these various scales, necessitates including relevant local actors.

To address seasonal variation, the survey was carried out both at the beginning and the end of the dry season. A total of 15 species of cladocerans were identified. Daphnia was the most abundant cladoceran genus, and was present in all reservoirs. Using presence-absence data, no association between cladoceran community composition and geographic distance was found. RDA results indicate that the set of environmental variables that explained cladoceran community composition differed among seasons. Depth, altitude and fish biomass showed a significant association with cladoceran community composition during the wet season, whereas variation in cladoceran community structure was associated with phytoplankton biomass in the dry season. The relative abundance of Daphnia was much higher in the pelagic than in the littoral zone of our study systems. Two key groups of pelagic filter-feeding cladocerans, Diaphanosoma and Daphnia, showed a clear pattern, in which one or the other tended to strongly dominate the community. In addition, we observed a negative association between dominance of Daphnia in the zooplankton community and dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Estimating walleye (Sander vitreus) movement and fishing mortality using state-space models: implications for management of spatially structured populations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish often exhibit complex movement patterns, and quantification of these patterns is critical for understanding many facets of fisheries ecology and management. In this study, we estimated movement and fishing mortality rates for exploited walleye (Sander vitreus) populations in a lake-chain system in northern Michigan. We developed a state-space model to estimate lake-specific movement and fishery parameters and fit models to observed angler tag return data using Bayesian estimation and inference procedures. Informative prior distributions for lake-specific spawning-site fidelity, fishing mortality, and system-wide tag reporting rates were developed using auxiliary data to aid model-fitting. Our results indicated that post-spawn movement among lakes was asymmetrical and ranged from approximately 1% to 42% per year, with the largest outmigration occurring from the Black River, which was primarily used by adult fish during the spawning season. Instantaneous fishing mortality rates differed among lakes and ranged from 0.16 to 0.27, with the highest rate coming from one of the smaller and uppermost lakes in the system. The approach developed provides a flexible framework that incorporates seasonal behavioral ecology (i.e., spawning-site fidelity) in estimation of movement for a mobile fish species that will ultimately provide information to aid research and management for spatially structured fish populations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2016	73	3					330	348		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0021													WOS:000375423600002
J	Everson, I; Taabu-Munyaho, A; Kayanda, R				Everson, Inigo; Taabu-Munyaho, Anthony; Kayanda, Robert			Acoustic estimates of commercial fish species in Lake Victoria: Moving towards ecosystem-based fisheries management	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Data from the first series of lakewide fisheries acoustic surveys of Lake Victoria, East Africa, have been re-analysed according to current protocols. Surveys took place in February and August each year between 1999 and 2002. The primary aim has been to estimate the standing stock of Nile perch and dagaa, the main species taken in commercial fisheries on the lake. The results show that over the period of the surveys from 1999 to 2002 there was no significant trend in the standing stock of either species with time although there was a significant seasonal effect higher values in February as compared to August. Information from bottom trawls during the surveys supports these conclusions. The results have been considered in the context of a food web from which it is concluded that in order for sufficient food to be present for the Nile perch there must be a significant proportion of the decapod crustacean Caridina present. It is noted that this species can be estimated acoustically using multifrequency echosounders but is very difficult with the single frequency system used on the 1999-2002 surveys. Refinements in the methodology will permit the simultaneous assessment of several key components in the food web and open the way to effective ecosystem-based fisheries management.

Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) chick bioenergetics following round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invasion and implementation of cormorant population control	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As the fish community changed in the Beaver Archipelago (northern Lake Michigan), so has the diet of breeding Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). In 2000, the energetically dense alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) dominated the diet, but more recently, the relatively low quality round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has become the most common prey item. Additionally, cormorant control measures have been underway in the archipelago. This study investigated decreases in cormorant chick numbers and changes in chick bioenergetics in response to this change in diet, as well as the influence of control efforts, and compared these results to an earlier study. Two colonies, one actively controlled the other only controlled following completion of this study, were investigated to determine changes in colony size throughout the breeding season, document chick diet, measure chick growth, and determine chick survivorship to fledging. The bioenergetics model estimated that in 2010, chicks consumed a greater biomass of prey to reach fledging due to the change in diet, but lower biomass overall due to fewer chicks in the system. Control efforts in combination with the change in diet reduced chick numbers. Overall, the impact of cormorant chicks on available fish biomass has declined in recent years due to control efforts. However, the birds have the potential to consume a greater biomass of round goby in the absence of control. The impact of cormorants on fisheries resources is complicated by the abundance and effects of non-native species. (c) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

This study evaluates the impact of the enhanced seasonality characteristic of the Marine Isotope Stage 31 (MIS31) on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Based upon coupled climate simulations driven by present-day (CTR) and MIS31 boundary conditions, we demonstrate that the CTR simulation shows a significant concentration of power in the 3-7-year band and on the multidecadal timescale between 15 and 30 years. However, the MIS31 simulation shows drastically modified temporal variability of the ENSO, with stronger power spectrum at interannual timescales but the absence of decadal periodicity. Increased meridional gradient of sea surface temperature (SST) and wind stress in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics are revealed to be the primary candidates responsible for changes in the equatorial variability. The oceanic response to the MIS31 ENSO extends to the extratropics, and fits nicely with SST anomalies delivered by paleoreconstructions. The implementation of the MIS31 conditions results in a distinct global monsoon system and its link to the ENSO in respect to current conditions. In particular, the Indian monsoon intensified but no correlation with ENSO is found in the MIS31 climate, diverging from conditions delivered by our current climate in which this monsoon is significantly correlated with the NINO34 index. This indicates that monsoonal precipitation for this interglacial is more closely connected to hemispherical features than to the tropical-extratropical climate interaction.

Insights to bioprocess and treatment competence of urban wetlands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wetlands play a major role in the recharge of groundwater resources, maintenance of water quality (remediation), moderate microclimate while supporting local livelihood through provision of fish, fodder, etc. The present study aims to investigate algal-bacterial consortium as a function of residence time with the water quality dynamics in two major wetlands in Bangalore city, India. Over thirty-two genera of algae were recorded with more than 40 species in the lakes and two dominant bacterial assemblages. The higher Ammonium-N content favoured the growth of these members. Significant correlation was observed between the nutrient concentrations and the community structure at the inflows and the outflows. The algal community showed negative correlation to filterable COD and high nutrients levels while bacterial abundance was observed under high loadings. The green algae Chlorophyceae (Chlorella blooms), which are indicators of nutrient enrichment were observed predominantly, that needs an immediate attention. Higher overall treatment efficiency was observed in terms of CNP removal during the Pre-monsoon season attributed to absence of macrophytes cover and rapid growth of algal assemblage's due to higher temperature regimes with adequate solar insolation.

Based on biostratigraphic information, the magnetostratigraphy of the Rubielos de Mora-1 core is calibrated to the Astronomical Tuned Neogene Time Scale (ATNTS04) resulting in an age of Early Miocene for the cored sedimentary sequence. The high percentages of thermophilous taxa and the diverse subarid flora in the pollen spectra points to a very dry subtropical climate with a marked seasonality, reflecting the onset of the Miocene climatic optimum. On the other hand, taxa with high water requirements (riparian) are also abundant. Alternation in pollen taxa (thenuophilous vs. mesothermic-riparian), coincide with sedimentological changes, which are related to lake level fluctuations and vegetation changes. In turn, the vegetational pattern indicates cyclic changes in temperature and precipitation which is controlled by astronomically forced obliquity cycles. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Marks, D; Domingo, J; Susong, D; Link, T; Garen, D				Marks, D; Domingo, J; Susong, D; Link, T; Garen, D			A spatially distributed energy balance snowmelt model for application in mountain basins	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Snowmelt is the principal source for soil moisture, ground-water re-charge, and stream-flow in mountainous regions of the western US, Canada, and other similar regions of the world. Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km(2), with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management.

Comparative age and growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in lakes Nabugabo and Wamala, Uganda	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Age and growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from Lake Nabugabo and Lake Wamala, Uganda, were determined using cross-sectioned sagittal otoliths. Marginal-increment and edge analyses of Nile tilapia otoliths from Lake Nabugabo indicated formation of two annuli per 12-month period. Opaque zones associated with faster growth were observed between April and June and between September and December, coincident with the two rainy seasons of the year. Within both lakes, males were larger at age than females. Nile tilapia from Lake Nabugabo, however, had faster growth rates than Nile tilapia from Lake Wamala, and fish > 3 years old from Lake Nabugabo were larger at age than those from Lake Wamala. Ages ranged from 0 to 8.0 years for Nile tilapia from Lake Nabugabo, and from 0.5 to 6.5 years for tilapia from Lake Wamala. Differences in the patterns of growth in Nile tilapia between lakes may reflect, at least in part, the relatively energy-rich omnivorous diet of Nile tilapia in Lake Nabugabo versus a phytoplanktivorous diet in Lake Wamala. Diet differences of Nile tilapia between the two lakes are ascribed to trophic changes in the lakes due to the introduction of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) into Lake Nabugabo but not Lake Wamala. Alternatively, the greater exploitation of Nile tilapia in Lake Nabugabo may have resulted in increased growth rates, whereas Nile tilapia in Lake Wamala may be subject to slower, density-dependent growth.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2007	589						287	301		10.1007/s10750-007-0746-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0746-y													WOS:000248228300024
J	Rengefors, K; Gustafsson, S; Ståhl-Delbanco, A				Rengefors, K; Gustafsson, S; Ståhl-Delbanco, A			Factors regulating the recruitment of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic phytoplankton from littoral and profundal sediments	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Many phytoplankton species produce resting cysts, forming 'seed banks' on lake sediments until they germinate and provide inocula (recruitment) for future pelagic populations. We have addressed the question of whether the littoral or the profundal zone provides the inoculum for planktonic populations in a eutrophic and dimictic lake (Lake Erken, Sweden). Our hypotheses were that high temperature, light, and sediment mixing would enhance recruitment. Also, we hypothesized that recruitment from littoral sediments would be greater than from profundal sediments. In situ recruitment traps were utilized to compare littoral and profundal recruitment, while laboratory experiments were performed to analyze which factors were most important. Seven common taxa were investigated: Asterionella formosa (Bacillariophyceae), Ceratium hirundinella (Dinophyceae), Microcystis botrys, M. wesenbergii, Anabaena sp., A. solitaria, and A. lemmermannii (Cyanobacteria). Our main findings were that light and sediment mixing were the most important factors in triggering and enhancing recruitment in the laboratory. Temperature and sediment origin (littoral/profundal) had a significant effect on recruitment only for A. lemmermannii and C. hirundinella, respectively. The field experiments showed that recruitment at the littoral site was much higher than at the profundal site, where little or no recruitment occurred. Together, these results strongly suggest that littoral sediments in temperate lakes provide inocula for most phytoplankton populations, likely due to favorable light conditions and high sediment mixing.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				SEP 14	2004	36	3					213	226		10.3354/ame036213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame036213													WOS:000224897600002

The comparison of bacterial grazing rates to bacterial production demonstrated a high transfer efficiency from the bacterial compartment up to flagellates. Per capita grazing rates ranged from 1.2 X 10(3) to 5.1 X 10(6) bacteria l(-1) h(-1) for heterotrophic flagellates, and from 4.8 X 10(6) to 6.8 X 10(7) bacteria l(-1) h(-1) for mixotrophic flagellates. The main bacterial grazers were Katablepharis within heterotrophic flagellates and Dinobryon within mixotrophic flagellates. Our results show that bacterial ingestion by a given flagellate taxon changed seasonally and could vary up to 30-fold. We also provide evidence that mixotrophic flagellates represent an important link in the flux of materials through planktonic food webs in Lake Annecy, suggesting that the introduction of mixotrophs within functional groups could improve our understanding of carbon flux pathways.

J	Jiménez-Segura, L; Restrepo-Angel, JD; Hernandez-Serna, A				Jimenez-Segura, Luz; Restrepo-Angel, Juan D.; Hernandez-Serna, Andres			Drivers for the artisanal fisheries production in the Magdalena River	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												We review knowledge on the Magdalena River in Colombia and its fish to identify those drivers that influence the artisanal fisheries production. We identify eight direct drivers (four natural and four anthropogenic) and at least four indirect drivers. Those drivers modify conditions in the fluvial network that promote fish movements, reproduction, and their larvae survivor. Landscape, rains, floods, connectivity of the fluvial net as land cover change, water pollution, hydropower, and alien species are the natural and anthropogenic direct drivers described in this article. The river-lake interaction dynamics in the Magdalena River are determined by two rainy cycles per year. Two seasonal flooding periods induce two cycles in the biological productivity of floodplains because water and sediment inputs. The most visible consequences in these hydrological cycles are the migrations of potamodromous fish and the periodic increase in the artisanal fishery production. Major floodplains are reducing their storage capacity by trapping & SIM;10%-40% of upstream sediment production. This process induces many research questions about rates of biomass production, carbon fluxes in the basin, impacts of human-induced erosion, and increasing rates of sediment load on floodplain connectivity, but still there is not enough data to answer them. Finally, we make some suggestions toward the sustainability of the Magdalena floodplains. The well-being of the floodplain ecosystems and their connectivity with the main river are the main tools to preserve and manage the ecosystem services of the Magdalena River and its floodplains lakes.																				2296-665X				OCT 6	2022	10								866575	10.3389/fenvs.2022.866575	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.866575													WOS:000875525700001

The ca. 4-m-high walls of the main northern pit (Pit I) expose excellent cross sections of Late Holocene volcaniclastic deposits in northern Managua. We have subdivided the section into six lithostratigraphic units, some of which we correlate to Late Holocene eruptions. Unit I (1.2 m thick), chiefly of hydroclastic origin, begins with the footprint layer. The bulk is dominated by mostly massive basaltic-andesitic tephra layers, interpreted to represent separate pulses of a basically phreatomagmatic eruptive episode. We correlate these deposits based on compositional and stratigraphic evidence to the Masaya Triple Layer erupted at Masaya volcano ca. 2,120 +/- 120 a B.P.. The eruption occurred during the dry season. A major erosional channel unconformity up to 1 m deep in the western half of Pit I separates Units II and I. Unit II begins with basal dacitic pumice lapilli up to 10 cm thick overlain by a massive to bedded fine-grained dacitic tuff including a layer of accretionary lapilli and pockets of well-rounded pumice lapilli. Angular nonvesicular glass shards are interpreted to represent hydroclastic fragmentation. The dacitic tephra is correlated unequivocally with the ca. 1.9-ka-Plinian dacitic Chiltepe eruption. Unit III, a lithified basaltic-andesitic deposit up to 50 cm thick and extremely rich in branch molds and excellent leaf impressions, is correlated with the Masaya Tuff erupted ca. 1.8 ka ago. Unit IV, a reworked massive basaltic-andesitic deposit, rich in brown tuff clasts and well bedded and cross bedded in the northwestern corner of Pit I, cuts erosionally down as far as Unit I. A poorly defined, pale brown mass flow deposit up to 1 m thick (Unit V) is overlain by 1-1.5 m of dominantly reworked, chiefly basaltic tephra topped by soil (Unit VI). A major erosional channel carved chiefly between deposition of Units II and I may have existed as a shallow drainage channel even prior to deposition of the footprint layer. The swath of the footprints is oriented NNW, roughly parallel to, and just east of, the axis of the channel. The interpretation of the footprint layer as the initial product of a powerful eruption at Masaya volcano followed without erosional breaks by additional layers of the same eruptive phase is strong evidence that the group of 15 or 16 people tried to escape from an eruption.

Evidence for widespread anoxia in the proglacial zone of an Arctic glacier	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The major ion (SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-) and stable isotope composition (delta O-18-H2O, delta O-18-SO42- and DIC-delta C-13) of ground- and surface water samples collected from the proglacial zone of a retreating high Arctic glacier,(Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard) indicate the widespread occurrence of microbially-mediated processes under anoxic conditions. The delta O-18-SO42- active layer groundwaters, lake and stream waters is strongly depleted in O-18 compared to the delta O-18-H2O, and stable isotope mass balance arguments indicate that 75-95% of SO42- in these waters is produced by the oxidation of sulphide minerals using Fe (III) and NO3- under anoxic conditions. Consistent with this is the frequent loss or depletion of NO3- from ground- and surface waters. SO42- concentrations and delta O-18-SO42- and delta O-18-H2O data suggest that much of the SO42- is generated anoxically early in the melt season in O-18 depleted snowmelt, and is immobilized as sulphate salts in near surface moraine due to evaporative of concentration. These salts are remobilized later in the season by rainfall and glacial flood events and cause the delta O-18-SO42- proglacial meltwaters to be < delta O-18-H2O. The latter become isotopically heavy through the melt season due to evaporation. The lack of any relationship between delta O-34-SO42- and delta O-18-SO42- and relatively heavy DIC-delta C-13 values in proglacial waters suggests that sulphate reduction is not a significant process. Acidity produced during anoxic oxidation of sulphides appears to drive chemical weathering in the proglacial zone, enabling high chemical weathering rates to be maintained despite the absence of dissolved oxygen. Similar findings have been reported from subglacial environments, where anoxic sulphide oxidation is widely observed. The absence of evidence for sulphate reduction in the proglacial groundwaters, however, suggests that the degree of anoxia in deglaciated settings may not be widespread as in subglacial environments, where significant sulphate reduction has been observed.

Antecedent aeolian dune topographic control on carbonate and evaporite facies: Middle Jurassic Todilto Member, Wanakah Formation, Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Middle Jurassic Todilto Member of the Wanakah Formation is a carbonate and gypsum unit inset into the underlying aeolian Entrada Sandstone in the San Juan Basin. Field and thin section study of the uppermost Entrada and Todilto at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, identified Todilto facies and their relationship to remnant Entrada dune topography. Results support the previous interpretation that the Entrada dunes, housed in a basin below sea level, were rapidly flooded by marine waters. Mass wasting of the dunes gave rise to sediment-gravity flows that largely buried remnant dune topography, leaving ca 12 m of relief that defined the antecedent condition for Todilto deposition. Previously interpreted as seasonal varves deposited in a stratified water body, the Todilto is reinterpreted as a microbial biolaminite. Most diagnostic are organic-rich laminae with structures characteristic of filamentous microbes and containing trapped aeolian silt, and clotted-texture laminae with a fabric associated with calcification of extracellular polymeric substances. The spatial arrangement of Todilto facies is controlled by the dune palaeotopography. A continuous basal laminated mudstone thickens over the dune crest, reflecting the optimum conditions for microbial mat development, and is interpreted to have been deposited when marine waters submerged the topography. Subsequent drying caused emergence of the crestal area, and formation of tepee structures and a dissolution breccia. Gypsiferous mudflats and periodic ponds occupied the dune flanks and interdune area, with gypsum concentrated within the interdune area. Entrada sands remained unstable during Todilto deposition with common injection structures into the Todilto, and a remnant slope caused the downslope movement and folding of Todilto strata on the upper lee face. Although some expansion of the gypsum occurred in the subsurface, facies architecture fostered development of a dissolution front adjacent to the interdune gypsum body with section collapse of gypsiferous limestone on the dune flanks.					; Cardenas, Benjamin/HHC-7929-2022; Martindale, Rowan/N-9853-2015; Mohrig, David/O-1758-2013	Hassenruck-Gudipati, Hima J./0000-0003-3885-7387; Cardenas, Benjamin/0000-0001-7246-219X; Martindale, Rowan/0000-0003-2681-083X; Goudge, Timothy/0000-0003-4297-9838; Kerans, Charles/0000-0002-3544-9006; Hughes, Cory/0000-0002-7061-1443; Day, Mackenzie/0000-0003-3998-7749; Mohrig, David/0000-0003-1828-4526													0037-0746	1365-3091				APR	2019	66	3					808	837		10.1111/sed.12518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12518													WOS:000460772800002

Biting the Bullet: Dealing with the Annual Hunger Gap in the Alaotra, Madagascar	SUSTAINABILITY												The hunger gap (the annual period of hardship when most crops are growing but not yet ready for harvest) remains a reality for many smallholder farmers throughout the globe. With a population largely relying on agriculture, and high poverty and malnutrition rates continuously afflicting the country, farmers in Madagascar are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the hunger gap, further putting pressure on already fragile ecosystems. Using a case study in the Alaotra region, we examine the seasonal trends of climate and agricultural resource dynamics, as well as characterize farmers' experiences of and strategies used in response to the hunger gap, in order to assess how conservation may better consider the hunger gap to align its objectives with local needs. Results show that farmers are vulnerable to climatic events during a large part of the year, exacerbating the impacts of the hunger gap. The hunger gap appears to have varying degrees of impact on communities around Lake Alaotra, linked to factors such as road quality and agrarian structuresfor example, land tenure and size of parcelscontributing to growing environmental degradation. We end by discussing various past and present responses aimed at improving the resilience of farmers of the Alaotra region, including improved accessibility, agricultural intensification, and conservation agriculture.					; Waeber, Patrick O/A-3649-2016; Stoudmann, Natasha/AAO-1954-2020; Kull, Christian/C-5806-2015; Garcia, Claude/D-2023-2011; Waeber, Patrick/A-3649-2016	Garcia, Claude/0000-0002-7351-0226; Waeber, Patrick O/0000-0002-3229-0124; Kull, Christian/0000-0002-7516-7898; Stoudmann, Natasha/0000-0003-3954-2272; Reibelt, Lena/0000-0003-0279-664X														2071-1050				APR 1	2019	11	7							2147	10.3390/su11072147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11072147													WOS:000466551600324

Due to a nonlinear dependence of water level changes on these factors, a nonlinear model is needed to more realistically estimate their relative contribution. In this study, the attribution analysis of long-term water level changes was performed by incorporating multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network. We took the Taihu Plain in China as a case study where water level series (1954-2014) were divided into baseline (1954-1987) and evaluation (1988-2014) periods based on abrupt change detection. The results indicate that climate variables are the dominant driver for annual and seasonal water level changes during the evaluation period, with the best performance of the MLP model having precipitation, evaporation, and tide level as inputs. In the evaluation period, the contribution of human activities to water level changes in the 2000s is higher than that in the 1990s, which indicates that human activities, including the rapid urbanization, are playing an important role in recent years. The influence of human activities, especially engineering operations, on water level changes in the 2000s is more evident during the dry season (March-April-May (MAM) and December-January-February (DJF)).

On account of storage influences, large lakes therefore provide a useful test case although, due to the spatial scales involved, there are a number of modelling challenges related to data availability and understanding the individual components in the water balance. Here some possible model structures are investigated using a range of stochastic regression and transfer function techniques with additional insights gained from simple analytical approximations. The methods were evaluated using records for two of the largest lakes in the world Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria - with forecast skill demonstrated several months ahead using water balance models formulated in terms of net inflows. In both cases slight improvements were obtained for lead times up to 4-5 months from including climate indices in the data assimilation component. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the results to operational flow forecasting systems for other large lakes.					; Beven, Keith/F-8707-2011; Tych, Wlodzimierz/K-6510-2012; Tych, Wlodek/K-6510-2012	Beven, Keith/0000-0001-7465-3934; Tych, Wlodzimierz/0000-0003-1655-844X; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JAN 9	2018	22	1					127	141		10.5194/hess-22-127-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-127-2018													WOS:000419717200001
J	Bruhn, R; Lakaschus, S; McLachlan, MS				Bruhn, R; Lakaschus, S; McLachlan, MS			Air/sea gas exchange of PCBs in the southern Baltic Sea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Air/sea gas exchange is an important process for the environmental fate of many semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs). The ability to quantify this flux can be very useful, e.g. for understanding the role of seas as a sink or a source for SOCs. In this work the air/sea gas exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was investigated in the Baltic Sea, a particularly contaminated marine ecosystem. Air and water samples were collected during three cruises in the southern Baltic Sea and analysed for eight PCB congeners. Water/air fugacity ratios were calculated using literature values for the air/water partition coefficients. A sensitivity analysis indicated that it was not possible to identify the direction of net air/sea exchange of gaseous PCBs with 95% certainty due to the uncertainty in the air/water partition coefficients. Even when this uncertainty was reduced by using a recent set of internally consistent physical-chemical properties of PCBs, the direction of the net flux was only ascertainable for PCB 28/31. The uncertainty in the fugacity ratio rendered a quantification of the air/sea exchange flux impossible. Nevertheless, the observation that the PCBs in the air/sea system were relatively close to a partitioning equilibrium was useful in identifying discrepancies and weaknesses in existing estimates of the PCB mass balance for the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the observation of lower water/air fugacity ratios for the more lipophilic PCB congeners suggests that vertical export with particulate organic material can cause a fugacity deficit of lipophilic substances in surface water of the Baltic Sea.

This study was performed to determine the effect of meteorological variables on the formation and expansion of toxic phytoplankton communities in Aras dam reservoir. The data of this project have been obtained using field studies and satellite data (MODIS and Sentinel-2). Sampling to determine the composition of phytoplankton communities in the area was carried out seasonally in two time periods from 2003 to 2014, and environmental assessments were also performed based on meteorological and satellite data over an 18-year period (2003-2020). The Chlorophyll-a content was obtained from MODIS and correlated with meteorological data. The statistical analysis showed that the highest coefficient of determination is related to the correlation of chlorophyll-a and Evaporation (R-2 =0.86). Also, the relative root mean square error is equal to 18%, 18.1% and 21.2% for the chlorophyll-a -SST, chlorophyll-a -wind and chlorophyll-a -Evaporation relations, respectively. Moreover, in a supplementary study, correlation between the chlorophyll-a content with selected meteorological variables including evaporation, wind speed and water surface temperature were investigated seasonally. The results showed that the trend of changes in chlorophyll-a content with three considered variables are parabolic functions and chlorophyll-a-Evp (R-2 =0.86, MAPE =15.2%) model indicates better performance. The results also showed that the eutrophication rate of the reservoir during lockdown period increased in comparison with the same time at pre-pandemic period, which can be related to increase of incoming waste loads in this reservoir.

Impact of Wastewaters from Apatite-Nepheline Production on the Biogeochemical Processes in an Arctic Mountain Lake	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The Khibiny alkaline massif and associated apatite-nepheline deposits host the world's largest reserves of phosphate raw materials, which have been explored for more than 90 years. The perennial hydrochemical and hydrobiological studies of the largest reservoir in the Khibiny alkaline massif, Lake Bolshoy Vudjavr, showed that the influx of waste waters from apatite-nepheline production led to the cardinal changes in natural biogeochemical processes. Mineralization, pH value, the fraction of alkali metals and SO42- in the ionic composition, the content of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds have significantly increased in the water of the lake. The water column of Lake Bolshoy Vudjavr shows a clear vertical hydrochemical stratification due to the distribution of water flows from two main tributaries in different layers. Phytoplankton communities and their quantitative indicators in Lake Bolshoy Vudjavr significantly differ from the conditionally background values; and the naturally oligotrophic reservoir currently corresponds to the mesotrophic status. The composition of phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms, with less common cyanobacterial species capable of causing blooming and toxic pollution of lake water. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton is characterized by a single pronounced July maximum. The development of phytoplankton is affected by pH value and the contents of Si and NH4+, with a definite stimulating role played by Cd.

J	Remmert, I; Johnson, MD; Ström, OJ; Peternell, M; Becher, GP				Remmert, Izabella; Johnson, Mark D.; Strom, Olof Johansson; Peternell, Mark; Becher, Gustaf Peterson			Seasonal subglacial ponding deposits in a thick till sequence, Dosebacka drumlin, southwest Sweden	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Current melting of glaciers has increased interest in understanding glacier hydrology and the interplay between subglacial meltwater, the glacier bed, and ice behavior. However, little is known about the sedimentology of subglacial meltwater deposits, and no sediment type or sequence has been identified as being unique to subglacial settings. Here, we analyze a repetitive, coarsening-upward, sorted-sediment sequence in a thick, diamicton section that we interpret to be seasonal, subglacial meltwater deposits. Over 20m of diamicton that we interpret to be subglacial traction till is exposed in a rock-cored drumlin at Dosebacka, Sweden, and the till contains multiple interbeds, 25-75 cm thick, of sorted sediment, each consisting of a coarsening-upward sequence of laminated clay, graded laminae of silt, and sand with pebbles. Based on sediment logs, grain-size, thin-section analysis, structural analysis, and field sedimentology, we investigate the genesis of these interbeds and conclude the interbeds to represent subglacial pond deposits. The coarsening-upward sequence represents cessation of till deposition due to hydrostatic bed separation followed by (1) suspension settling of clay in a subglacial blister/pond with drop-grains froman ice roof, (2) suspension settling of pulses of silt and very fine sand in still water coupled with occasional turbidites, (3) traction sedimentation (and loading) of sand and gravel from flowing water, and (4) renewed till deposition following reattachment. The interbeds also reveal deformation that is oriented parallel to the ice-flow direction and which we attribute to deformation during ice-bed reattachment. This sediment sequence parallels in character the seasonal behavior of supraglacial meltwater development on Greenland and moulin drainage, and we argue that the interbeds represent pond deposits during seasonal meltwater drainage. Drainage formed a subglacial blister/pond when the ice reached floatation point, and clay and, later, silt were deposited. With time, drainage became better integrated, and sand and pebbles were deposited by flowing water until reattachment when till deposition resumed. Additionally, based on our interpretation and the attitude of the beds in the drumlin, which parallel the drumlin slope, we argue the drumlin to have been formed by accretion rather than erosion. The anomalous thickness of the till and the numerous interbeds also imply a relatively rapid sedimentation rate, indicating the drumlin formed quickly (10's of years). This stoss-side environment allowed for preservation of the unique interbeds. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The spatial distribution characteristics and the spreading rules of these wetlands have also been revealed. Based on full understanding of the overall characteristics of the inland wetlands in the Yadong region, using the three phases of TM images acquired in 1989, 2003 and 2008 as well as the PMS2 data gathered by GF-1 in 2014, and the wide-range data (WFV3) gathered by GF-1 in 2020. As to the typical salt lakes, a long-time salt lakes transition study was carried out. The results show that the typical salt lakes in Yadong have been shrinking in the past three decades. The average annual shrinkage of Duoqing Co (Co means lake in Tibetan) was stronger than that of Gala Co, which are respective 87.30 hectares (usually short as ha; 1 ha equals to 0.01 km2) /a and 24.20 ha/a; the shrinkage degree of Gala Co was higher than that of Duoqing Co, shrank by 59.27% and 35.73% respectively. Based on the remote sensing survey results and an integrated analysis of the predecessors' researchers, the reason for the shrinkage of the salt lakes is more inclined to geological factors. Geological process is manifested by a series of extensional faults at the bottom of the lake basin generated from tectonic activities, providing fluid infiltration channels, and inducing the eventual leakage of lake water to the lower strata. The result provides an important instance for understanding the evolution characteristics of wetlands and salt lakes in specific environment of the Tibetan Plateau.

The effect of aquatic and terrestrial habitat characteristics on occurrence and breeding probability in a montane amphibian: insights from a spatially explicit multistate occupancy model	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Understanding species distribution and predicting range shifts are major goals of ecology and biogeography. Obtaining reliable predictions of how species distribution might change in response to habitat change requires knowledge of habitat availability, occupancy, use for breeding, and spatial autocorrelation in these parameters. Amphibians in alpine areas provide an excellent model system for disentangling habitat drivers of occupancy from that of breeding while explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We focused on the widespread common frog (Rana temporaria) inhabiting alpine lakes in the Southern Carpathians, Romania. We used single season multistate occupancy models developed to account for imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation to estimate the occupancy and breeding probabilities and to evaluate their response to habitat characteristics. We found that frogs do not occur in all water bodies [occupancy probability: 0.697; 95% credible interval (0.614, 0.729)] and do not breed in a substantial proportion of water bodies where they occur [breeding probability conditional on occupancy: 0.707; 95% credible interval (0.670, 0.729)]. Habitat characteristics explain water body occupancy but not breeding probability; and altitude, water body surface area, water body sinuosity and permanency, presence of invertebrates, and grazing along the banks all had positive effects on occupancy. We also detected strong spatial autocorrelation in occupancy and breeding probabilities. Thus, our results indicate that habitat choice by montane amphibians is influenced by both spatial autocorrelation and habitat characteristics. Because spatial autocorrelations matter and because the presence of adults is not the same as the presence of a reproducing population, it will be difficult to predict the effects of habitat change on high altitude amphibian populations.

At the background of restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, four season investigations were conducted during 2014-2015 to study the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities, explore their relationships with environmental factors, and forecast the change trends in assemblages in a long period after restoration measures. A total of 40 species were recorded, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the communities. Season variation in density and biomass were distinct and the community differences in lakes related to the degrees of organic pollution. In comparison with the historical data, the species richness of mollusks in Donghu lake sharply decreased due to water pollution and the loss of diverse habitat. Concerning on the whole BELWN, the whole taxa recorded in our study was slightly fewer than the previous study. A new recorded species polychaete Nephtys sp. was first collected with an important ecological interest. As an urban lake system dominated by eutrophication, the water nutrients significantly affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates. According to the GAM models, the dominant species responded to environmental gradients with different response curves. After restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, the macroinvertebrate communities would change and the biodiversity would steadily increase with time. Additionally, the new recorded species Nephtys sp. would spread into the whole BELWN in the foresee future.

Plankton composition, biomass, phylogeny and toxin genes in Lake Big Momela, Tanzania	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Lake Big Momela, one of the East African soda lakes in Northern Tanzania characterised by highly saline-alkaline conditions, making them inhospitable to a range of organisms, although supporting massive growths of some adapted planktonic microorganisms that serve as food for birds, such as Lesser Flamingo. The temporal dynamics of plankton, with an emphasis on cyanobacteria, were examined in 2007 using morphological traits and ribosomal genetic markers (16S and 18S rRNA). Cyanobacterial genes encoding for hepatotoxins (mcyE and ndaF) were also screened. Rotifers and copepods dominated the zooplankton, whereas cyanobacteria, such as Anabaenopsis elenkinii and Arthrospira fusiformis dominated the phytoplankton community, and these being related to representatives in other East African soda lakes. The cyanobacteria community also showed distinct seasonal patterns influenced by environmental parameters, mainly salinity, pH and nitrate. Significant positive correlations were found between phytoplankton abundance and nitrate concentrations (r = 0.617, p = 0.033). No signals of the hepatotoxin synthetase genes mcyE and ndaF were retrieved from cyanobacteria during the whole year. In general, our data illustrate the presence of rich planktonic communities, including some unique and potentially endemic cyanobacteria.

The lake minnow was found to be a primary gonochoristic fish species, where gonads are formed directly in the ovaries or testes. The morphological differentiation of gonads was initiated 35 days post hatch (DPH) when two types of gonadal anlages were visible: a pear-shaped gonad attached by a single mesentery string and a spindle-shaped gonad attached on both sides to the peritoneum. Gonadogenesis occurred faster in females than in males, with the first previtellogenic oocytes and ovarian lamellae being already observed in 45 DPH fish. In males, cytological differentiation occurred approximately 85 DPH, when the fish reached an average body weight of more than 400 mg. No significant effect of rearing temperature on sex ratio in lake minnow juveniles was observed. The proportion of males and females was similar (close to 1:1) in all of the thermal-treated groups, although there were effects of temperature on the final sizes of fish. Histological examination of wild, mature lake minnow ovaries during the annual cycle (from May to February the following year) showed asynchronous oocyte maturation. The testes were characteristic of multi-batch spawning '' fish. Quantitative dominance of spermatids and mature spermatozoa in May was observed, while the presence of primary and secondary spermatocytes in all other periods was confirmed. These changes were also reflected in the seasonal variation in the gonado-somatic index in both sexes, with the highest mean values of 11.2% (females) and 4.0% (males) in May, which were found to be significantly different to all other periods. The data presented in this study provide an important contribution to our understanding of the biology and reproductive strategy of the endangered lake minnow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Arctic Ice Shelf Ecosystems	ARCTIC ICE SHELVES AND ICE ISLANDS	Springer Polar Sciences											Arctic ice shelves are microbial ecosystems with a rich biodiversity. Until recently, polar ice shelves were seen as mostly abiotic glaciological features, however they are oases for life, with snow, meltwater pools and sediments providing cryohabitats for microbiota. The biological communities are composed of diverse forms of microscopic life, including cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, viruses, algae, other protists and microfauna, and occupy a variety of habitats: supraglacial meltwater lakes, englacial microhabitats within the ice and snow and planktonic environments in ice-dammed, epishelf lakes. These habitats are defined by seasonal light availability, cold temperatures and nutrient poor conditions. In the supraglacial pools, production is dominated by benthic microbial mat assemblages that have diverse stress adaptation systems and that use internal nutrient recycling and scavenging strategies. Despite short growth periods and perennial low temperatures, biomass accumulations are considerable, with a striking diversity of light-harvesting, UV-protection and other accessory pigments. The chemical characteristics such as conductivity and origin of salts are defined by the underlying ice types, and microbial mat studies from adjacent habitats show a high resilience to solute concentration during freeze-up. The structural integrity of these cryoecosystems is dependent on ice, and they are therefore vulnerable to climate change. Many of these unique Arctic ecosystems have been lost by ice shelf collapse over the last two decades, and they are now on the brink of complete extinction.

Sapanca is one of lakes which can be used as the resource of drinking water in Turkey. In addition, Sapanca Lake is one of the most important drinking water sources for the province of Sakarya and its surroundings. Ten different stations were chosen as sampling points. Water samples were collected from these stations in January 2016, April 2016, July 2016 and October 2016. The samples were digested with the use of a microwave digestion procedure. The heavy metal analysis of samples was carried out using ICP-MS. In general, heavy metal concentrations in the lake water decreased in the following sequence: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni> Cr > Pb > Cd. Concentrations of the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni, and Zn in the water of Sapanca Lake are at acceptable levels according to WHO (World Health Organization) and TS 266 (Turkish Standard) water standards.

A size- and age-structured model to estimate fish recruitment, growth, mortality, and gear selectivity	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Most stock assessment models are solely age-based and ignore variability in length-at-age, but the incorporation of length structure can improve parameter estimates. Here, we present an age- and length-structured population model to estimate fish recruitment, von Bertalanffy growth parameters, natural mortality, and gear selectivity from survey length- and age-specific catch, fishery length distributions, and total harvested biomass. We evaluated parameter bias when fitting the model to simulated data with variable fish longevity, survey sampling duration (i.e., years of data), survey gear selectivity (i.e., asymptotic or dome-shaped), instantaneous fishing mortality rate and fishing mortality trend (i.e., stable or increasing). Median proportional bias in mortality (fishing and natural), growth, and gear selectivity parameters did not exceed 0.05 across all scenarios. Median recruitment bias ranged up to 0.12 and was greatest for the short-lived species and for scenarios with increasing fishing mortality, but bias for all other scenarios was less than 0.1. The model was demonstrated using data from a whole-lake biomanipulation of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) at a 2300-ha lake in Florida, USA. Model estimates of gizzard shad exploitation rate were similar to an independent estimate from an in-season depletion analysis. Estimates of gizzard shad natural mortality and growth parameters were within the range of literature values for the species. The model could be useful for estimating growth, mortality, and recruitment parameters that account for gear selectivity and the cumulative effects of size-selective harvest. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of earthquakes on agriculture during the Roman-Byzantine period from pollen records of the Dead Sea laminated sediment	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Dead Sea region holds the archives of a complex relationship between an ever-changing nature and ancient civilisations. Regional pollen diagrams show a Roman-Byzantine period standing out in the recent millennia by its wetter climate that allowed intensive arboriculture. During that period, the Dead Sea formed laminites that display mostly a seasonal character. A multidisciplinary study focused on two earthquakes, 31 BC and AD 363, recorded as seismites in the Ze'elim gully A unit III which has been well dated by radiocarbon in a previous study. The sampling of the sediment was done at an annual resolution starting from a few years before and finishing a decade after each earthquake. A clear drop in agricultural indicators (especially Oleo and cereals) is shown. These pollen indicators mostly reflect human activities in the Judean Hills and coastal oases. Agriculture was disturbed in large part of the rift valley where earthquake damage affected irrigation and access to the fields. It took 4 to 5 yr to resume agriculture to previous conditions. Earthquakes must be seen as contributors to factors damaging societies. If combined with other factors such as climatic aridification, disease epidemics and political upheaval, they may lead to civilisation collapse. (C) 2009 University of Washington.

However, the mechanisms and processes of nutrient release at the sediment-water interface of shallow lakes in cold regions remain unclear, especially under the complex environmental conditions of freezing and open-water periods. Therefore, Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) and High-resolution Peeper technologies (HR-Peeper) were used to investigate the nitrogen and phosphorus characteristics of the sediment water interface, and the process of bacteria affecting the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle was clarified by the highthroughput sequencing technology. The results indicated that sediment phosphorus (PO43- ) flux ranged from -1.39 to 3.6 mg/m2 center dot d, with the interstitial water-Soluble Reactive PO4 3- presenting notable fluidity and potential bioavailability. The ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) flux varied from -4.71 to 3.65 mg/m2 center dot d. The nitrate nitrogen (NO3 --N) flux varied from -11.64 to 1.18 mg/m2 center dot d, exhibiting an opposite trend to NH4+-N, which was released into water bodies during the freezing period and migrated to the sediments in the open water period. Common metabolic pathways and functional genes for nitrogen and phosphorus were identified in Methylomicrobium, Marinobacter, and Psychrobacter. The dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) facilitated the transformation of polyphosphates and the release of phosphorus. Water temperature indirectly regulated the fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus at the sediment-water interface (SWI) by modulating the microbial abundance and dissolved oxygen (DO) content.					shi, ruijia/IAR-1398-2023; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023; Wang, Shihuan/OBO-1586-2025; yan, jianghong/NHO-8564-2025														0169-7722	1873-6009				JUL	2025	273								104598	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2025.104598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2025.104598								40382897					WOS:001496021100001

In vegetation stands with relatively low methane (CH4) emissions (<0.3 mol m(-2) (ice-free period)(-1)), the seasonal variation of CH4 efflux was better correlated with the dynamics of plant growth than variation in sediment temperature. In dense and productive vegetation stands that released high amounts of CH4 (2.3-7.7 mol m(-2) (ice-free period)(-1)), the seasonal variation in CH4 efflux was correlated with sediment temperature, indicating that methanogens were more limited by temperature than substrate supply. The bottom type at the growth site of the emergent plants significantly influenced the ratio of CH4 efflux to aboveground biomass of plants (Eff : B). The lowest Eff : B ratio was found in E. fluviatile stands growing on sand bottom under experimental conditions and the highest in P. australis-dominated littoral areas accumulating detritus from external sources. The future changes expected in the hydrology of boreal lakes and rivers because of climatic warming may impact the growth conditions of aquatic macrophytes as well as decomposition and accumulation of detritus and, thus, CH4 effluxes from boreal lakes.

A DESCRIPTION OF FRESHWATER TURTLE HABITAT DESTRUCTION BY FERAL PIGS IN TROPICAL NORTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Feral pigs cause major disturbance to wetland habitats that are frequented by freshwater turtles, although the effects have not been quantified. We assessed how feral pig (Sus scrofa) foraging activities affect turtle (Chelidae) habitat in a pair of fenced and unfenced ephemeral floodplain lagoons at Lakefield National Park on Cape York Peninsula, Australia. Feral pigs caused major changes to aquatic macrophyte communities and as a consequence, to the proportional amounts of open water and bare ground. The destruction of macrophyte communities and upheaved wetland sediments significantly affected wetland water clarity and caused prolonged anoxia and pH imbalances in the unfenced lagoon. The combined effects of vegetation destruction and the subsequent excretion of pig wastes also resulted in high nutrient enrichment. Clearly, exclusion fencing will protect freshwater turtle habitats from feral pig foraging activities, however, the choice of which lagoons to fence should only be made with an understanding of their seasonal usage by freshwater turtles.																			1931-7603					DEC	2009	4	3					331	339																WOS:000207820200007

This study assessed the effects of drainage intensity on water and nitrogen use efficiency and rice grain yield in a field experiment conducted during three seasons in Rwanda. The experiment comprised 12 plots with four blocks and three treatments: DS0.6(0.6 m deep drain), DD1(1.2)(1.2 m deep drain, control structure open four times per week), and DD2(1.2)(1.2 m deep drain, control structure open two times per week). Outflow was calculated from water balance. Nitrogen (N) content in drainage water was determined weekly. Crop yield and N uptake were determined in grain and straw. In all seasons, grain yield was 61-131% higher, crop N uptake was 24-90% higher, harvest index (HI) was 24-65% higher and water use efficiency (WUE) was 50-150% higher in treatments DD1(1.2)and DD2(1.2)than in DS0.6. There was a decrease in soil carbon/nitrogen ratio at the end of Seasons 2 and 3. Recirculating straw to fields is thus necessary to replenish SOC for long-term soil fertility. A practical implication of the study is that managed deep drainage systems could enhance water use efficiency and rice grain yield in poorly drained paddy fields.

This requires integrated studies of all surface water and groundwater bodies and of their quite-complex interconnections. We present here a simple method for estimating the annual mean water balance of sub-Sahelian lakes subject to high seasonal contrast and located in isolated regions with no road access during the rainy season, a situation which precludes continuous monitoring of in situ hydrological data. Our study focuses for the first time on two lakes, Iro and Fitri, located in the eastern basin of Lake Chad. We also test the approach on Lake Ihotry in Madagascar, used as a benchmark site that has previously been extensively studied by our group. We combine the delta O-18 and delta H-2 data that we measured during the dry season with altimetry data from the SARAL satellite mission in order to model the seasonal variation of lake volume and isotopic composition. The annual water budget is then estimated from mass balance equations using the Craig-Gordon model for evaporation. We first show that the closedsystem behavior of Lake Ihotry (i.e., precipitation equal to evaporation) is well simulated by the model. For lakes Iro and Fitri, we calculate evaporation to influx ratios (E/I) of 0.6 +/- 0.3 and 0.4 +/- 0.2, respectively. In the case of the endorheic Lake Fitri, the estimated output flux corresponds to the infiltration of surface water toward the surface aquifer that regulates the chemistry of the lake. These results constitute a first-order assessment of the water budget of these lakes, in regions where direct hydrological and meteorological observations are very scarce or altogether lacking. Finally, we discuss the implications of our data on the hydro-climatic budget at the scale of the catchment basins. We observe that the local evaporation lines (LELs) obtained on both lake and aquifer systems are slightly offset from the average rainfall isotopic composition monitored by IAEA at N'Djamena (Chad), and we show that this difference may reflect the impact of vegetation transpiration on the basin water budget. Based on the discussion of the mass balance budget we conclude that, while being broadly consistent with the idea that transpiration is on the same order of magnitude as evaporation in those basins, we cannot derive a more precise estimate of the partition between these two fluxes, owing to the large uncertainties of the different end-members in the budget equations.					; Ménot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017; Deschamps, Pierre/M-9632-2013; Menot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017; NOUR, Abdallah/AAR-4464-2021	Vallet-Coulomb, Christine/0000-0001-5898-1516; Deschamps, Pierre/0000-0003-1687-3765; Menot, Guillemette/0000-0003-2423-8294; Mahamat Nour, Abdallah/0000-0001-5364-2750; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 26	2019	23	3					1705	1724		10.5194/hess-23-1705-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1705-2019													WOS:000462556900001

Fish fossils as paleo-indicators of ichthyofauna composition and climatic change in Lake Malawi, Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Numerous biological and chemical paleorecords have been used to infer paleoclimate, lake level fluctuation and faunal composition from the drill cores obtained from Lake Malawi, Africa. However, fish fossils have never been used to examine changes in African Great Lake vertebrate aquatic communities nor as indicators of changing paleolimnological conditions. Here we present results of analyses of a lake Malawi core dating back similar to 144 ka that describe and quantify the composition and abundance of fish fossils and report on stable carbon isotopic data (delta C-13) from fish scale, bone and tooth fossils. We compared the fossil delta C-13 values to delta C-13 values from extant fish communities to determine whether carbon isotope ratios can be used as indicators of inshore versus offshore pelagic fish assemblages. Fossil buccal teeth, pharyngeal teeth and mills, vertebra and scales from the fish families Cichlidae and Cyprinidae occur in variable abundance throughout the core. Carbon isotopic ratios from numerous fish fossils throughout the core range between -7.2 and -27.5 parts per thousand, similar to those found in contemporary Lake Malawi benthic and pelagic fish faunas. These results are the first paleo-record of fish fossils from a Lake Malawi sediment core and the first reported delta C-13 values from Lake Malawi fish fossils. This approach provides a new methodology and framework for interpreting pelagic versus inshore fish faunas, lake level fluctuations and the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish assemblages.

Feeding spectra of Arctodiaptomus salinus (Calanoida, Copepoda) using fatty acid trophic markers in seston food in two salt lakes in South Siberia (Khakasia, Russia)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												During two vegetation seasons (20042005), we compared feeding spectra of Arctodiaptomus salinus (Calanoida, Copepoda) populations inhabiting two neighboring salt lakes, Shira and Shunet, Khakasia, Russia, using fatty acid (FA) trophic markers. Sestonic FA composition in two lakes moderately differed, whereas levels of diatom FA markers were higher in Lake Shunet and of Cyanobacteria and green algae markers in Lake Shira. In general, markers in storage lipids-triacylglycerols (TAG) of A. salinus-reflected the differences in sestonic composition of the two lakes. Nevertheless, TAG fraction was also enriched by FA trophic markers of the minor components of seston, which were selectively ingested by the animals. In Lake Shira, A. salinus had significantly higher concentrations of bacterial FA markers in TAG. In Lake Shunet, TAG of A. salinus contained significantly higher relative amounts of 18: 4 omega 3, 18:5 omega 3 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which indicated marked contribution of cryptophytes or (and) flagellates into the diet. Laboratory experiments showed feeding on Cryptomonas and sulfur purple bacteria in Lake Shunet and ciliates and colonial picoplankton in both lakes, and generally confirmed the differences in FA trophic markers in A. salinus between the lakes. The two populations of A. salinus markedly differed in levels of essential long-chain PUFA, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, although the levels of these FA in seston were quite similar between the two lakes. The higher levels of the essential omega 3 PUFA in A. salinus in Lake Shunet may be an adaptive response of the animals to a vertical stratification of physico-chemical conditions and significantly higher salinity levels at the boundary of adjacent bottom layer in this lake.					; Sushchik, Nadezhda/P-9395-2015; Makhutova, Olesia/I-9855-2016; Zotina, Tatiana/S-4975-2017; Gulati, Ramesh/F-4943-2013; Kalacheva, Galina/I-8975-2014; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/I-9601-2018	Zotina, Tatiana/0000-0002-4792-1582; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9124-4566; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2010	44	3					513	530		10.1007/s10452-010-9331-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9331-y													WOS:000285338600005

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												At six sites in western Kenya, we explored the presence of Anopheles immature stages in treeholes. An. 'gambiae larvae were found in 19 species, 13 of which are exotic. The most common exotic species were Delonix regia, Jacaranda mimosipholia, and Eucalyptus citrodora. In Kisumu city, longitudinal assessments of 10 flamboyant trees showed repeated presence of An. ganibiae s.s. in treeholes with water. Production of Anopheles larvae did not correlate with habitat volume but with habitat height, showing a strong but statistically insignificant negative correlation. During a dry season, eggs recovered by rinsing dry treeholes hatched into 2.5 +/- 3.06 An. gambiae and 7.9 +/- 8.2 Aedes larvae. In cage experiments, An. gambiae s.s. laid more eggs in water originating from treeholes than in distilled or lake water, implying preference for ovipositing in this habitat. Our findings indicate that treeholes represent a hitherto unrecognized habitat Tor malaria vectors, which needs further studies.																			0002-9637	1476-1645				DEC	2007	77	6		S			264	269		10.4269/ajtmh.2007.77.264	http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.2007.77.264								18165501					WOS:000252212600038

Environmental contributions to the evolution of trait differences in Geum triflorum: Implications for restoration	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise How the environment influences the distribution of trait variation across a species' range has important implications for seed transfer during restoration. Evolution across environments could influence fitness when individuals are transferred into new environments. Here, we evaluate the role the environment has had on the distribution of genetic variance for traits important to adaptation. Methods In a common garden experiment, we quantified trait differentiation for populations of Geum triflorum sourced from three distinct ecoregions and evaluated the ability of climate to predict trait variation. Populations were sourced from the Manitoba and Great Lake alvar ecoregions that experience predictable extremes in seasonal water availability and the prairie ecoregion which exhibits unpredictable changes in water availability. Results Plants sourced from alvar ecoregions exhibited smaller but more stomata and greater intrinsic water-use efficiency relative to prairie plant populations, supporting the evolution of ecotypic differences. Estimates of standing genetic variance and heritable genetic variation for quantitative traits suggest alvar populations have greater adaptive potential. However, low evolvability suggests all populations likely have limited capacity to evolve in response to environmental change. Conclusions These results highlight the importance of the environment in influencing the evolution and distribution of genetic differences across populations used as seed sources for restoration. Additionally, these data may inform recommendations for seed transfer across novel environments and our expectations of populations' adaptive potential.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				NOV	2022	109	11			SI		1822	1837		10.1002/ajb2.16061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.16061		SEP 2022						36151780					WOS:000857287300001

Zooplankton in the Lake Tana Shore Zone (Ethiopia) at the Beginning of the Dry Season	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												At the beginning of the dry season, immediately after the end of the rainy season, estimations of zooplankton abundance have been carried out in three types of shore areas of Lake Tana (Ethiopia): (1) open water, (2) borders of thickets, and (3) macrophyte thickets. The minimum quantitative characteristics of plankton animals are reported in macrophyte thickets; the maximum are in areas of open water. Negative correlations are obtained between the level of overgrowth by macrophytes and the quantitative characteristics of zooplankton organisms. The peculiarities of the quantitative development and structure of zooplankton in the zone of thickets and at their border, when compared with open water areas (as well as compared with the second half of the dry season), indicate the leading role of top-control in the formation of invertebrate communities, which is associated with an increase in the number of young fish. Optimal conditions for feeding and shelters for juvenile fish during daylight hours are formed at the boundary of macrophyte thickets, as a result of which the minimum abundance and biomass of zooplankton are found there.					; Shkil, Fedor/AAJ-4030-2020; Krylov, Alexandr/A-6616-2017; Prokin, Alexander/Q-6136-2016	Shkil, Fedor/0000-0002-5637-8278; Zelalem, Wondie/0000-0001-5322-7100													1995-0829	1995-0837				OCT	2020	13	4					605	612		10.1134/S1995082920040057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082920040057													WOS:000611998700015

The study uses the groundwater and surface water flow (GSFLOW) model to quantify the dynamics of SGIs in the Pingtung Plain groundwater basin (PPGB) in southern Taiwan. Specifically, the study uses a physical-based numerical model to quantify the spatial and seasonal variations of water cycles influenced by complex fluvial landform conditions and human activities. Results of the model calibrations show good agreement with the data obtained from the available groundwater monitoring network and the selected stream stations. The basin-scale water budgets show highly nonuniform precipitation in the study area, and over 80% annual precipitation is from wet seasons in the PPGB. With high permeable surficial deposits in the PPGB, the year-averaged surface runoff and infiltration are approximately 57% and 40% of the total precipitation. The fluvial landforms with the high slope in the PPGB lead to 70% of annual surface runoff that becomes the streamflow, and the interflow dominates water interactions near streambeds. Results show that the interflow rate in the wet seasons is 200% more than that in the dry seasons. The net groundwater discharge to the streams is relatively small as compared to the interflow. Only 10% of the river flow is from the net groundwater discharge. In the PPGB, The pumping-induced variations of groundwater levels are insignificant as compared with the factor of the natural landforms. Because of the relatively small area of the proposed artificial lake, the contribution of the artificial lake on the local water budgets is insignificant, indicating the low impact of the artificial recharge lake on the surface water environment.

Salt Marsh Pond Biogeochemistry Changes Hourly-to-Yearly but Does Not Scale With Dimensions or Geospatial Position	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Shallow ponds are expanding in many salt marshes with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning. Determining how pond characteristics change over time and scale with physical dimensions and other spatial predictors could facilitate incorporation of ponds into projections of ecosystem change. We evaluated scaling relationships across six differently sized ponds in three regions of the high marshes within the Plum Island Ecosystems-Long Term Ecological Research site (MA, USA). We further characterized diel fluctuations in surface water chemistry in two ponds to understand short-term processes that affect emergent properties (e.g., habitat suitability). Primary producers drove oxygen levels to supersaturation during the day, while nighttime respiration resulted in hypoxic to anoxic conditions. Diel swings in oxygen were mirrored by pH and resulted in successive shifts in redox-sensitive metabolisms, as indicated by nitrate consumption at dusk followed by peaks in ammonium and then sulfide overnight. Abundances of macroalgae and Ruppia maritima correlated with whole-pond oxygen metabolism rates, but not with surface area (SA), volume (V), or SA:V. Moreover, there were no clear patterns in primary producer abundances, surface water chemistry, or pond metabolism rates across marsh regions supplied by different tidal creeks or that differed in distance to upland borders or creekbanks. Comparisons with data from 2 years prior demonstrate that plant communities and biogeochemical processes are not in steady state. Factors contributing to variability between ponds and years are unclear but likely include infrequent tidal exchange. Temporal and spatial variability and the absence of scaling relationships complicate the integration of high marsh ponds into ecosystem biogeochemical models.

HBCDs (45 to 890 pg L-1, n = 107) were generally equally distributed between the operationally defined freely dissolved and particulate phases in English lake water. Concentrations of HBCDs declined over the sampling period with half-lives of 5.1 years in English water, with a significantly decreasing trend also observed for Niagara River suspended sediments (NRSSs). With respect to seasonal trends, significantly higher concentrations were found in colder compared to warmer periods at 5 out of 9 English lakes, while NRSSs in this study revealed no statistically significant seasonal trends. The maximum HBCD concentration in NRSSs was about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those detected in English lake water, which is plausible given the greater per capita use of HBCD in Europe than North America. While gamma-HBCD was consistently dominant (35-86%; mean = 56%) in English lake water samples, and dominated in NRSSs collected prior to 2002 inclusive (13-100%, mean = 73%), the abundance of gamma-HBCD was significantly lower (3.5-37%; mean = 23%) in NRSSs from 2003 onwards.

Q.			ESTIMATES OF MONTHLY AND ANNUAL EVAPORATION RATES AND EVAPORATED VOLUMES PER UNIT TIME IN THE TUCURUI-PA AND LAJEADO-TO HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT RESERVOIRS BASED ON DIFFERENT METHODS	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA												Evaporation rates in reservoirs influence the volume of water available for multiple uses. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the evaporation rates and the evaporated volumes per unit time in the Tucurui-PA and Lajeado-TO reservoirs based on the methods in Linacre (1993), Kohler et al. (1955), Morton (1983), Bruin & Keijman (1979) and Penman (1948) method was adopted as the standard. The mean annual evaporation rates in the Tucurui and Lajeado reservoirs, estimated by the Penman method, were similar, with values of 1,784 mm and 1,882 mm, respectively. None of the alternative analyzed methods could be used to estimate the mean annual evaporation in the Tucurui and Lajeado reservoirs and could not replace the Penman method. However, the Linacre (1993) and Bruin & Keijman (1979) methods could be used to estimate monthly evaporation during the dry season in Tucurui. The mean evaporated volume per unit time and the mean net evaporated volume per unit time in the Tucurui reservoir correspond to 120% and 50%, respectively, of the total water demand in the Tocantins-Araguaia region, while the mean evaporated volume per unit time and the mean net evaporated volume per unit time in the Lajeado reservoir correspond to 120% and 50%, respectively, of the total water demand in the basin.

Bioremediation of South Africa's hypertrophic Hartbeespoort Dam: evaluating its effects by comparative analysis of a decade of MERIS satellite data in six control reservoirs	INLAND WATERS												Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data on chlorophyll alpha (Chl-alpha,mu g L-1) and cyanobacteria (Cyan, %) content in Hartbeespoort Dam (HBPD) and 6"control" reservoirs between 2002 and 2012 were compared to assess potential effects of a bioremediation project (HMaM) implemented on HBPD in 2008, Planktonic autotrophs showed clear but inconsistent seasonal periodicity in all 7 reservoirs. Neither average (+/- 95% confidence interval) values of Chl-alpha(172.1 +/- 33.3 vs. 189.0 +/- 40.3 mu g L-1) nor Cyan (45.1%+/- 8.6 vs. 45.0% +/- 9.0) differed significantly (p <= 0.05) in HBPD before and after HMaM, but differed (higher and/or lower) in 3 control systems. Across 3 timespans (overall, before 2008, and after 2008), Mann-Kendall tests for Chl-alpha and Cyan revealed mixed trends between and within reservoirs with similarly mixed trends in monthly anomaly values (ChlAnom and CyanAnom) that offset confounding effects of interannual variability. Chl-alpha and ChlAnom, however, declined consistently in all reservoirs after 2008, significantly so for Chl-alpha in HBPD and 2 controls, and for ChlAnom in HBPD and 5 controls. Although Cyan and CyanAnom trends varied, both were significantly negative in HBPD after 2008. Directionally concordant anomaly trends were provided by parallel 50th quantile regression analysis. Comparable declines in Chl-alpha and ChlAnom across all reservoirs preclude causal interpretation of the declines in HBPD as direct consequential effects of HMaM intervention alone, giving whole-lake support to published empirical evidence contesting the suitability of biomanipulation for eutrophic reservoir management in the region.

The evaluation of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassiper) control program in Rawapening Lake, Central Java Indonesia	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT (4TH ICSAE)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				4th International Conference on Sustainable Agriculture and Environment (ICSAE)	AUG 10-12, 2017	Surakarta, INDONESIA					The existence of water hyacinths and other aquatic plants have been a major concern in Rawapening Lake for many years. Nutrient input from water catchment area and fish feed residues suspected to leads eutrophication, a condition that induces uncontrolled growth of aquatic plants. In dry season, aquatic plants cover almost 70% of lake area. This problem should be handled properly due to wide range of lake function such as water resources, fish farming, power plants, flood control, irrigation and many other important things. In 2011, Rawapening Lake was appointed as pilot project of Save Indonesian Lake Movement: the Indonesian movement for lakes ecosystem conservation and rehabilitation. This project consists of 6 super priority programs and 11 priority programs. This paper will evaluate the first super priority program which aims to control water hyacinth bloom. Result show that the three indicators in water hyacinth control program was not achieved. The coverage area of Water hyacinth was not reduced, tend to increase during period 2012 to 2016. We suggesting better coordination should be performed in order to avoid policies misinterpretation and to clarify the authority from each institution. We also give a support to the establishment of lake zonation plan and keep using all the three methods of cleaning water hyacinth with a maximum population remained at 20%.

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of the calcifying bivalved phytoflagellate Phacotus lenticularis (Ehrenberg) Deising 1866 on the total calcite precipitation in five European hard-water lakes. For this purpose, an accurate mass determination of single Phacotus lenticularis shells was required. We developed a novel methodological approach to precisely determine the volume and mass of the calcified shells. Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques were employed to investigate internal structural features. Thin layer cross-sections of the shell profiles were reproduced and perforation as well as the crystalline structure of the calcite plates were monitored. 3D-shell models were computed by 360 degrees rotation of the shell cross-sections using a CAD 3D imaging software to calculate precise volumes and estimate realistic masses. In contrast to previous estimates, we determined a 2.8-fold higher shell mass of 0.86 ng CaCO3(SD 0.18) for the highly massive shells at a mean volume per individual of 334.1 mu m(3)(SD=70). An initial shell porosity of less than 5% was derived from thin layer cross-section images, resulting in a presumed mean shell density of 0.0026 ng mu m(-3),The shell diameter was significantly influenced by the lake's origin. The shells from each lake displayed substantial variations in diameter and shape. The pores in the shells showed two variations. Wider pore canals penetrated the whole shell wall, whereas small, elongated pores were located along the interspaces between calcite crystals with tabular habit. The approximate average dimensions of these calcite plates were 1.0x 1.6x0.2 mu m. The mean lateral wall thickness at the rim and centre of the shell were 1.98 mu m (SD-0.42) and 0.79 mu m (SD-0.17). respectively. The average carbonate precipitation by Phacotus lenticularis in relation to the total epilimnetic suspended calcite precipitation was 6% in the oligotrophic lake Grosser Ostersee (Bavaria, Germany). During the growing season, Phacotus lenticularis contributed up to 21% of the particulate calcium carbonate in the epilimnion. These findings suggest that Phacotus lenticularis should be considered in the assessment of hard-water lake carbon cycling.

Neglecting the dynamics of the relationship at the lake-specific scale would mislead the eutrophication control strategy. The Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) is a flexible tool to explore dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship and improves the overall estimation accuracy by partial pooling of data. In this study, we used the BHMto show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship in one of themost eutrophic lakes in China (Lake Dianchi). We defined an indicator (the Chla/TP ratio, CPR), to represent the susceptibility of Chla to TP. We conducted a model selection process and used the CPR-TP curves to show the spatial and seasonal dynamics of the ChlaTP relationships. We determined that the wind caused the spatial dynamics due to the horizontal transport of phytoplankton, while the water temperature and the percentage of soluble reactive phosphorus led to the seasonal dynamics via increasing the growth rate of phytoplankton. These findings helped the eutrophication control in Lake Dianchi. We found that compared with the strategy to decrease the TP concentration, decreasing the susceptibility is expected to be more effective. Finally, we concluded that exploring the dynamics of the Chla-TP relationship provided an important basis for eutrophication control at the lake-specific scale.

Copepods are often the dominant zooplankton group in the tropical systems. Whether copepods tend to be omnivorous and their potential cascading effect on phytoplankton are subjects of debate. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses to elucidate the allochthony and trophic positions of two copepod species (Phyllodiaptomus tunguidus and Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides) and one cladoceran species (Diaphanosoma orghidani) over a one-year period in a tropical oligo-mesotrophic reservoir in China. We assumed the filter-feeding D. orghidani was herbivorous and we used it as a baseline indicator of delta N-15 to estimate the trophic position of the two copepods. P. tunguidus and M. thermocyclopoides had an average trophic level that was 0.7 and 0.5 higher, respectively, than that of D. orghidani. M. thermocyclopoides showed seasonal differences in trophic position and an increase in trophic position with rising temperatures, whereas P. tunguidus remained omnivorous throughout the year. All three zooplankton species had a much higher degree of allochthony in the flood season than in the dry season, and their allochthony was positively related to the allochthony of the particulate organic matter input. The two copepods' omnivorous behavior suggests their allochthony was primarily linked to microbial food web based on the input of terrestrial organic matter. The chlorophyll a to total phosphorus ratio was much higher when P. tunguidus dominated the zooplankton community than when D. orghidani dominated. The ratio was positively related to the ratio of omnivorous adult copepods to cladoceran biomass but not to the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio. Our results suggest that copepods tended to be omnivorous and relied heavily on allochthonous material in the study reservoir. The indirect cascading effect is likely to be stronger than the direct grazing effect, resulting in a positive effect of copepods on the phytoplankton.

An assessment of the utility of Landsat 8 for detecting nutrients was conducted in Mazvikadei reservoir in Zimbabwe. The main objective was to determine whether nutrients often overlooked by remote sensing and yet are the main determinants of water quality can be remotely sensed. Sampling targeted ammonia, nitrates and reactive phosphorus from May to October 2015. In situ nutrient concentrations were regressed against reflectance derived from Landsat 8 imagery. Strong negative relationships were found between ammonia and the near-infrared band in July (R-2=0.80, p<0.05) as well as between nitrates and the blue band (R-2=0.67, p<0.05) in June. Overall, the results suggest that the cool dry season is the optimum time to use Landsat 8 for monitoring nutrients in tropical lakes.

The OCP determinations were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography with a reverse-phase C18 column. The total OCP levels ranged from 13.33 to 274.59ng/L in water, 4.63 to 239.11ng/g in sediments, and 23.79 to 387.12ng/g in fish species. The overall pattern of mean OCP concentrations followed the order as sigma DDTs>sigma endosulfan>aldrin and OCP pollution pattern among the headworks were Khanki Barrage>Qadirabad Barrage>Trimmu Barrage>Marala Barrage in all three environmental matrixes during both seasons. The estimated daily intake (EDI) for Sigma OCPs was found to be 22.44ng/kg/day. The hazard ratios calculated to assess the carcinogenic risk indicated that the values for Sigma DDT and aldrin at the 95th percentile concentrations were greater than one, indicating the probability of carcinogenic risk occurrence of one in million populations due to fish consumption. Therefore, these high levels of OCPs and carcinogenic risk through fish consumption highlight the needs of immediate elimination of OCPs from riverine environment of Chenab River and we recommend long-term monitoring-based freshwater ecological studies to be conducted in the study area.					; Khorram, Safaei/O-6712-2017; Mahmood, Adeel/Q-1803-2015; Baqar, Mujtaba/JDC-9352-2023	Safaei Khorram, Mahdi/0000-0001-5172-2773; Baqar, Mujtaba/0000-0003-1457-1659; 													0003-2719	1532-236X					2018	51	8					1245	1263		10.1080/00032719.2017.1372467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00032719.2017.1372467													WOS:000427934700010

Correlating gut microbial membership to brown bear health metrics	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The internal mechanisms responsible for modulating physiological condition, particularly those performed by the gut microbiome (GMB), remain under-explored in wildlife. However, as latitudinal and seasonal shifts in resource availability occur, the myriad micro-ecosystem services facilitated by the GMB may be especially important to wildlife health and resilience. Here, we use brown bears (Ursus arctos) as an ecological model to quantify the relationship between wildlife body condition metrics that are commonly used to assess individual and population-level health and GMB community composition and structure. To achieve these aims, we subsampled brown bear fecal samples collected during United States National Park Service research activities at three National Parks and Preserves (Katmai, Lake Clark, and Gates of the Arctic) and extracted microbial DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and microbial taxonomic classification. We analyzed GMB communities using alpha diversity indices, subsequently using Spearman's correlation analysis to examine relationships between alpha diversity and brown bear health metrics. We found no differences in GMB composition among bears with differing body conditions, nor any correlations between alpha diversity and body condition. Our results indicate that GMB composition reflects diverse foraging strategies while allowing brown bears to achieve similar body condition outcomes.					; Rogers, Matthew/AAG-3686-2020	McKenney, Erin/0000-0001-9874-1146; Trujillo, Sarah/0000-0002-6867-2837; Gustine, Dave/0000-0003-1087-1937; Rogers, Matthew/0000-0003-2543-4684													2045-2322					SEP 22	2022	12	1							15415	10.1038/s41598-022-19527-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-19527-4								36138067					WOS:000859183800014

Two non-toxic subcultures, MG-J and MB-J spontaneously succeeded the toxic ones under laboratory conditions. Southern analyses showed that MG-J and MB-J are lacking at least 34 kb of the mcy region, encoding the microcystin synthetase. Analyses of the 16S rRNA genes, the intergenic spacer region between cpcB and cpcA and the patterns of the polymerase chain reaction products of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and highly iterated palindrome, and presence of mobile DNA elements did not allow unequivocal distinction between toxic and non-toxic subcultures. Laboratory and field experiments indicated an advantage of the toxic strain over its non-toxic successor. When grown separated by a membrane, which allowed passage of the media but not the cells, MG-K severely inhibited the growth of MG-J. Furthermore, when MG strains were placed in dialysis bags in Lake Kinneret during the season in which Microcystis is often observed, cells of MG-J lysed, whereas MG-K survived. Mechanisms whereby the non-toxic subcultures emerged and prevailed over the corresponding toxic ones under laboratory conditions, as well as a possible role of microcystin under natural conditions, are discussed.

Experiments were carried out in the laboratory and in the field. Cysts, collected from different sites of the lake and peripheral lagoons, were hatched and cultured to adults in the laboratory. Adult sexual and parthenogenetic animals were isolated and newly hatched nauplii from them were cultured to maturity in different salinities, ranging from 15-80 ppt. Survival levels and percentage of animals attaining adulthood were measured over a period of 30 days. In the field experiment, cysts taken from Lake Urmia were hatched and the resulting nauplii were inoculated into six earthen ponds (80-140 ppt) constructed in the vicinity of the lake. Population composition in each pond was determined over a period of two years. Results indicated that both sexual and parthenogenetic Artemia coexist in Lake Urmia. While the lake itself is dominated by sexual Artemia, the asexual populations were found to be restricted to particular areas in or near the lake. Artemia appearing seasonally in the lagoons adjacent to the lake were exclusively parthenogenetic. Parthenogens could grow, mature and reproduce at very low salinities (15-33 ppt), whereas higher salinities (above 50 ppt) were required for A. urmiana to attain sexual maturity. We consider salinity to be a major abiotic factor determining the distribution of these sexually different populations within and outside the lake.

P concentrations in floodwater rapidly declined before the first event of field drying, and subsequently tended to return to the background levels. Before the first field drying TPP was the predominant P form in floodwater on fields with no P input, DRP on plots that received superphosphate only, and DOP on plots treated with the mixture of superphosphate and manure. Thereafter TPP became the major form. No P export was found from the paddy fields, but a retention of 0.65 kg ha(-1), mainly due to soil P sorption. The results recommend the zero-drainage water management for full-scale areas for minimizing P export.

Assessment of the ecological status of the Kinyankonge River (Burundi), using a Biotic Integrity Index of zooplankton (BII-zooplankton)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												This study aimed at assessing the ecological status of the Kinyankonge River using a zooplankton-based Biotic Integrity Index (BII-zooplankton). This was achieved through monthly collections of zooplankton from four stations along the river over 18 months (from July 2015 to June 2016, then from January 2017 to June 2017). Chemical parameters of the water were also measured using the AFNOR and APHA methods. Organic loads of water samples were assessed using Leclercq's Organic Pollution Index. Zooplankton levels of disturbance were evaluated by Karr's Biological Integrity Index. From this study, it was calculated that the Organic Pollution Index had two levels of pollution: strong organic pollution and very high organic pollution for upstream and downstream stations, respectively. Zooplankton populations were more disturbed during dry season than rainy season. The calculated Biotic Integrity Index highlighted a degradation of the ecological quality, especially in the upstream stations along the Kinyankonge River. Based on the zooplankton species diversity as an indicator of the ecological status of the river, the Biotic Integrity Index revealed a spatio-temporal variation highlighting four states of ecological quality of the Kinyankonge River: bad, moderate, good and very good, whereMicrocyclopssp. indicates bad ecological status,Brachionus angularisandTropocyclopssp. indicate moderate ecological status, whereasRotariasp. indicates very good ecological status.

The East Flood Canal (Banjir Kanal Timur = BKT) was built to address these problems by improving runoff (drainage) and increasing groundwater recharge. This research was conducted to reconstruct the history of environmental change, including seawater intrusion, along the coast of Semarang using pollen and diatom assemblages from a 190-cm-long,Pb-210-dated sediment core extracted from the estuary at the mouth of the BKT. The age of the sediments within the core ranged over 160 years (the surface dated to 2014). The sediments could be subdivided into three zones on the basis of pollen assemblages and 2 zones on the basis of diatom assemblages. Lower zone assemblages, dominated bySonneratia alba(mangrove),Acrostichum aureum(Pteridophyte), andCocconeis pediculus(an epiphytic diatom), indicate that historically, the estuarine ecosystem was relatively open to the Java Sea and characterized by periods of marine and freshwater conditions. Thereafter, an upward increase in saline mangrove species of pollen and diatoms, combined with the loss of freshwater species (e.g.,AvicenniaandRhizophora),indicates an increasing prevalence of marine conditions at the mouth of the BKT. Increasing salinity was associated with a landward shift in the mangrove ecosystem, a trend indicated by the progressive increase in mangrove plant diversity as statically manifested by the three pollen zones. This landward shift was associated with a "closing off" of marine flow in response to a significant (order of magnitude) increase in the estuarine sedimentation rates at about 1981. Increased sedimentation was presumably related to land-use changes that enhanced sediment delivery to the coast via the BKT. Inherent in these sediments were allochthonous fragments ofAsterionella formosa, a freshwater species found in the upper sediment layers. The results of this study are consistent with the increased saltwater intrusion along the coast and a decline in groundwater quality.

Influence of water temperature and net tending frequency on the condition of fish bycatch in a small-scale inland commercial fyke net fishery	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												To date, most studies of commercial fisheries bycatch have focused on mortality at time of capture as an endpoint. However, sub-lethal indicators of organismal condition have the potential to reveal mechanisms associated with mortality (both at time of capture and post-release) and opportunities for improving fish welfare. In this study, we simulated commercial fishing efforts in inland lakes with fyke nets during a typical fishing season (early April to late June) in southeastern Ontario, Canada, where bycatch of non-target fish species had previously been documented. Using non-target gamefish (i.e., largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides, Lacepede], northern pike [Esox Lucius, L.]), as well as a target species (i.e., bluegill [Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque]), we examined the sub-lethal consequences of capture (e.g., blood physiology, reflex impairment, and injury) and compared the effects of being retained in the net for two different durations (i.e., two or six days) over a range of water temperatures (i.e., 3-28 degrees C). Sublethal physiological disturbances (i.e., blood glucose and lactate) in largemouth bass and bluegill tended to be greater at higher water temperatures. However, fish retained for six days generally did not exhibit greater stress than those retained for two days, with the exception of plasma glucose in largemouth bass. Reflex impairment was similar among temperature and retention periods. Fish retained in nets experienced a range of injuries (including fin frays, scale loss, and mouth damage) that had the potential to facilitate the development of opportunistic pathogenic infections. Greater incidences of injury on fish bycatch tended to be associated with higher temperatures and longer retention. To reduce physiological disturbances and injury that could lead to delayed mortality, we suggest that regulations for inland commercial fishers require them to check their nets more frequently as water temperatures increase. We suggest that future studies of bycatch incorporate sub-lethal endpoints given that they serve as an objective measure of fish welfare and can provide quantitative mechanistic information to support management actions.

The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether melanisation in macroinvertebrates inhabiting high-altitude Andean streams is an adaptive response to high UV-B radiation. To explore whether altitude-related differences in melanin concentration between taxa were due to a variable community composition or due to population differentiation, mayfly species were identified genetically. We measured UV-B radiation from 650 to 4000m and compared body melanin concentrations from several benthic macroinvertebrate orders sampled at these altitudes. Five genera belonging to the mayfly family Baetidae were genetically identified to the species level. DNA sequencing was performed in individual larval legs to group genetically similar individuals before pigment analysis in the corresponding bodies. The UV-B radiation at 4000m was twice that at 3200m, four times that at 1900m and five times that at 650m. The melanin concentration in families belonging to Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Diptera and Turbellaria was twice as high at 4000m as at 3200m, but did not differ among taxa or between seasons. Five genera of the family Baetidae were identified: Americabaetis, Dactylobaetis, Tupiara, Baetodes and Thraulodes. Genetic differences were evident between Americabaetis sp. at 4000m from the Cordillera Blanca and at 3200m from the Rimac River valley, and between Tupiara taxa at 650 and 1900m in the Rimac River. In Americabaetis, melanin increased fivefold from 1900 to 4000m, while in Dactylobaetis and Tupiara, it was twice as high at 1900m as at 650m. In Baetodes, melanin at 4000m was twice that at 650 and 1900m, while in Thraulodes, it was almost three times higher at 4000m than at 3200m. In Tupiara, the differences in melanin levels were probably associated with species with different vertical distribution, while in Dactylobaetis, these differences were interpreted as phenotypic plasticity. Our results thus indicate that mayfly species within a single family have both constitutive and adjustable melanin concentrations, enabling them to cope with the strong selective UV-B environment. Adjustable melanin levels have commonly been observed under moderate UV-B regimes, while the constitutive, high melanin concentration is probably an attribute of high-altitude invertebrate fauna in the tropics.

Disruption in the seasonal cycle of many species has been reported, but the source of disruption varies from species to species. Lacustrine zooplankton species are widely acknowledged to respond to climate-induced, thermal and trophic variations. Here, we discuss the case of a warm-adapted copepod in Lake Biwa (i.e., Eodiaptomus japonicus), which experienced changes in trophic status and thermal regime over four decades (1966-2010). We investigated the phe-nological response of E. japonicus to these changes over this period and aimed to identify the sources of the observed variations. The combined results of wavelet analysis and cluster analysis indicated that E. japonicus exhibited different seasonal cycles during the study period. The common unimodal seasonal cycle of the copepod was disrupted on several occasions during which it presented sometimes two or three modes. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong stationary correlation with lake temperature for the total abundance, the clutch size, and the birth rate, but a transient correlation with the body size of females at the annual scale. No coherence was found with food proxies. Discriminant analysis between unimodal and plurimodal seasonal cycles highlighted the effect of low temperature and high predation in leading to plurimodal cycles. Our study emphasizes the need for considering the seasonality of both lower and higher trophic levels for understanding zooplankton phenology.

Comparison of regional carbon flux estimates from CO2 concentration measurements and remote sensing based footprint integration	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Quantification of terrestrial CO2 sources and sinks at regional scales (similar to 10(2)-10(6) km(2)) is fundamental to improving our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Two independent methods to extract the gross primary productivity (GPP) from atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements were explored and compared in this study. The methods are (1) planetary boundary layer (PBL) carbon budget analysis that allows the estimation of regional GPP at daily time steps from hourly CO2 concentration measurements and (2) spatially explicit hourly carbon cycle modeling based on remote sensing and then integrating the daily flux field with a concentration footprint function depending on wind and stability. These methods have been applied to a 28-m tower at an old black spruce site near Candle Lake (similar to 100 km NE of Prince Albert: 53.98717 degrees N, 105.11779 degrees W). The estimates of daily GPP by these two approaches agreed well for 2003 (slope = 0.99; r(2) = 0.89). In order to test these methods of inferring the regional GPP from mixing ratio measurements, we also compared the estimates of regional GPP with estimates made using eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements, although their respective source areas are different. They had similar seasonal patterns, but the regional estimates were consistently smaller than the local EC flux derived GPP throughout the growing season in 2003. These estimates of annual regional GPP were 649-664 g C m(-2) for 2003 while the EC-derived annual GPP was 819-847 g C m(-2). The annual difference was about 20-25%. The EC flux footprint of the tower was relatively homogeneous old black spruce while the concentration footprint, which was a few orders of magnitude larger than the flux footprint, covered boreal evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests, grassland, cropland, and lakes. Nonforested land occupied about 10-50% of the concentration footprint depending on wind direction and speed and was less productive than the black spruce forest. The discrepancies between regional and local GPP estimates reflected the differences in underlying land surfaces represented by the different footprint areas.

Understanding AVS formation rates is important for the management of metal polluted sediment. However, little lis known about the fate and dynamics of AVS in spatially and seasonally variable freshwater environments. The authors monitored in situ AVS formation and degradation and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in two floodplain lakes and compared this to AVS formation rates in laboratory experiments with the same sediment. In the laboratory experiments, the formation rates of AVS were studied at 20 degrees C for initially oxidized sediments that were: (a) untreated; (b) enriched with extra SO42-; and (c) treated with sodium-azide (biocide). In the field, AVS concentrations were highly variable and were significantly correlated to surface water temperature and O-2 concentrations as well as to sediment composition. Between February and August, AVS formation was approximately linear at a rate of 0.07 mu mol g(-1) d(-1). Degradation rates differed drastically between the lakes due to different degradation mechanisms. In one lake AVS removal was caused by reworking and oxygenation of the sediments by bream (Abrami brama), at a rate of 0.25 mu mol g(-1) d(-1). In the other lake AVS removal was caused by desiccation, at a rate of +/-2.6 mu mol g(-1) d(-1). This illustrates the large differences that can be found between similar lakes, and the importance of biological processes. In the laboratory, concentrations of AVS with and without SO42- addition were similar during the first weeks, and increased at a rate of 0.15 mu mol g(-1) d(-1). However, SO42- addition increased the AVS concentration at the end of the experiment, whereas sodium-azide eliminated AVS formation, as expected. This suggests that AVS formation was SO42--limited in the laboratory as well as in these shallow freshwater lakes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable and fast interpretation of water quality is therefore needed for sustainable river management. Unfortunately, water quality and environmental status interactions have not yet been documented sufficiently in West-Africa. This study explored the spatial-latitudinal and seasonal features of water quality along the So River Basin (SRB, West Africa) using self-organizing map (SOM) and principal component analysis. Twenty-two water quality variables were measured in the surface layer at 12 different sampling sites during a twenty-four-month period from July 2016 to June 2018. The results revealed three water quality groups, following an upstream-downstream pollution gradient: (1) upstream and middle reach sites with high dissolved oxygen and Secchi disk depth values, which are more suitable for the aquatic biota; (2) downstream sites with high concentrations of ammonium, biochemical oxygen demand, and heavy metals especially in flood period, reflecting both high organic and heavy metal pollution; and (3) brackish downstream sites characterized by less heavy metal and organic pollutions. No significant variation was observed between seasons. However, the SRB relatively suffered from higher risks of heavy metal contamination and organic pollution in wet seasons. Although hydroclimatic processes affect the water quality, anthropogenic inputs of point and non-point sources were identified and discussed as a more prominent factor contributing to variation in the water quality condition. These results offer insights into the water quality dynamics in river-estuary system as well as potential pollution sources, crucial for defining sanitation, and management measures.					; Park, Youngseuk/D-6462-2013; Odountan, Olaniran/JAN-8231-2023; CEREGHINO, Regis/G-9500-2011	Odountan, Olaniran Hamed/0000-0001-6947-0308; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2023	30	5					11893	11912		10.1007/s11356-022-22784-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22784-5		SEP 2022						36098918					WOS:000853475000011

The Carpathian Keuper sequence was deposited in an arid environment with only seasonal rivers, temporal lakes and swamps with scarce vegetation. Combination of a wide range of delta O-18 values (-0.7 to + 2.7) with negative delta C-13 values documents dolomite precipitation either from brackish or hypersaline lake water, or its derivation from pore water comparably to the Recent Coorong B-dolostone. Negative delta C-13 values indicate microbial C productivity. Rhaetian transgressive deposits with restricted Rhaetavicula fauna accumulated in nearshore swamps and lagoons. Associations of foraminifers, bivalves and sharks in the Zliechov Basin were controlled by physical factors. Bivalve mollusc biostromes were repetitively destroyed by storms, and temporary firm bottoms were colonized by oysters and burrowers. Subsequent black shale deposition recorded input of eolian dust. Bottom colonization by pachyodont bivalves, brachiopod and corals started much later, during highstand conditions. Facies evolution also revealed by geochemical data, C and O isotope curves reflect eustatic and climatic changes and help reconstruct the evolution of Rhaetian marine carbonate ramp. The Fatra Formation consists of 100 kyr eccentricity and 40 kyr obliquity cycles; much finer rhythmicity may record monsoon-like climatic fluctuations. Fluvial and eolian events were indicated by analysis of grain size and content of clastic quartz, concentrations of foraminiferal (Agathammina) tests in thin laminae indicates marine ingression events. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) variations reflect the distribution of authigenic and detrital constituents in the sequence. Increasing trend of MS correlates with the regressive Carpathian Keuper sequence and culminates within the bottom part of the Fatra Formation. Decreasing trend of MS is observed upwards the transgressive deposits of the Fatra Formation.

Understanding hydrological effects on P dynamics can optimize the ecological function of riparian wetlands to reduce nonpoint source pollution. The XiaZhuHu wetlands were selected for field P investigation, and two typical hydrological batch studies of 35 d each (a static column observation simulating the dry season, and a steady-flow flume observation simulating the rainy season) were conducted to understand sediment P dynamics and evaluate capacity of P immobilization. The average equilibrium P concentration of 0.02 mg L-1 among the 31 sampled sediments was generally lower than the average dissolved reactive P concentrations in the overlying water, indicating an ecological role as a P sink. In static simulation observation, there was a fast-pace sorption process during the first 3 d followed by a slower paced process, and the mass of P adsorbed per unit sediment surface (MPAS) reached 0.16 mg cm(-2). The temporal curves of P equilibrium between flowthrough water and top sediment (5 cm) were characterized as a quasi "V"-pattern, and the MPAS ranged from -0.04 to 0.46 mg cm(-2) during the steady-flow observation. The newly-trapped P was mainly found in Al-bound P and subsequently as Fe-bound P, which would be helpful for sediment P immobilization. Based on our findings, the sediment of the tested wetlands could retain external P from agricultural land by as much as 10-30 times the area of itself, which accounts for approximately 3.3-10% of the watershed area.

Flood duration determines the reproduction success of fish in artificial oxbows in a floodplain of a potamal river	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Fish reproduction was studied in six man-made water bodies (borrow pits) adjacent to the channelised Dyje River (Danube basin) over five seasons. Terrestrial vegetation provided spawning and nursery habitats when inundated by raised water levels in the borrow pits (hereafter referred to as 'floods'). The diversity of 0+ fish and the density of 0+ cyprinids (mainly Abramis bjoerkna, Scardinius erythrophthalmus and Rutilus rutilus) in June-October were positively correlated with flood duration in previous months. The density of 0+ Perca fluviatilis was independent of the flood duration. The density of spawners and predators did not influence the diversity of 0+ fish and the density of 0+ cyprinids. Receding flood and associated lack of shelters resulted in decreasing density of 0+ cyprinids, numbers sometimes decreasing to zero. Prolonged floods facilitated the survival of 0+ fish and resulted in high 1+ cyprinid density in the following season. Specific hydromorphological conditions (e.g., the presence of shallow littoral zone or flooded vegetation) are necessary to enable successful spawning and provide shelters for 0+ fish in artificial water bodies.

J	Komatsu, E; Fukushima, T; Shiraishi, H				Komatsu, Eiji; Fukushima, Takehiko; Shiraishi, Hiroaki			Modeling of P-dynamics and algal growth in a stratified reservoir - mechanisms of P-cycle in water and interaction between overlying water and sediment	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A water quality model was designed to represent longitudinal and vertical concentration variations in narrow, stratified lakes/reservoirs and was applied to the Shimajigawa reservoir in Japan. In order to predict the concentrations of nutrients, DO, iron, and plankton, three models were combined. They consisted of a runoff model, a lake/reservoir flow-transport model, and an ecological model. it is thought that algal growth in reservoirs is increased by the release of phosphorus from the sediment and that both the formation and dissolution of an iron-phosphate complex are key factors controlling the rate at which phosphorus is released. Thus, to understand the dynamics of phosphorus in the lake/reservoir, the iron cycle and related redox reactions in the water and sediment column were taken into consideration. In addition, the processes of phosphorus adsorption/sedimentation under aerobic conditions and phosphorus desorption/release from the sediment were described by modeling the creation and decomposition of the iron-bound phosphate complex. Following the calibration of its parameters, the model was shown to be able to reproduce the actual oxygen profile, the dynamics of iron and nutrients, and algal growth. In particular, by combining the ecological model with the iron-bound phosphate sub-model, we were able to predict changes in PO4-P concentrations in the hypolimnion. This shows that the combination of the iron-bound phosphate sub-model with the ecological model is very useful in understanding the dynamics of phosphorus in a lake/reservoir where a seasonal cycle between aerobic and anaerobic conditions occurs. In addition, the relationship between occasional algal blooms and phosphorus dynamics was investigated using the model. Algal densities in the reservoir were found to be strongly related to the amounts of phosphate transported from the lower layer to the epilimnion when turnover occurred, and were affected by the phosphorus dynamics of the lower layer. In turn, the amount of phosphate transported in this way was found to increase in accordance with the amount released from the sediment, which was found to depend on the development of an anaerobic layer.

J	Miettinen, H; Wirtanen, G				Miettinen, H; Wirtanen, G			Prevalence and location of Listeria monocytogenes in farmed rainbow trout	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY												A total of 5 10 rainbow trout originating from fish farms in lakes and sea areas around Finland were studied for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were studied as pools from five fish. Gill, viscera, and skin from the pooled samples were analysed separately. The individual samples were analysed later if the pooled sample was found to be Listeria positive. The prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in pooled unprocessed fresh rainbow trout was on average 35.0% and 14.6%, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in individual thawed fish was found to be 14.3% and 8.8%, respectively. These numbers tend to overestimate and underestimate the real situation because not all fish in pooled samples were necessarily contaminated and in some of the Listeria positive pooled samples all individual samples turned out to be Listeria free. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes varied greatly between different fish farms from zero to 100% in pooled samples and from zero to 75% according to individually studied fish samples. Some indications of the influence of weather conditions and seasonal variations that strongly affected the Listeria contamination of fish were also noticed. The location of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in different parts of the fish differed with statistical significance in rainbow trout. Up to 95.6% of the L. monocytogenes and 84.5% of Listeria spp. positive samples were gill samples. Only 4.4% (2/45) of the L. monocytogenes positive samples were obtained from skin or viscera. Closer study at one fish farm revealed that there was only one L. monocytogenes ribotype present in the contaminated fish, although water and surfaces were heavily contaminated with six other L. monocytogenes ribotypes.

The results indicated that lakes in the study area evidently expanded from 1976 to 2008, with total expansion of 1512.64 km(2). The mean annual air temperature presented an upward trend with certain fluctuations from 1966 to 2008. The air temperature rise rates in the cold season (0.31A degrees C/10a) were higher than those in the hot season (0.24A degrees C/10a), in the Xainza station example. Precipitation exhibited evident seasonal differences. Mean annual precipitation in hot season is 281.48 mm and cold season is 32.66 mm from 1966 to 2008 in study area. Precipitation in the hot season was the major contributor to the increase in annual precipitation. Grey relational analysis (GRA) was used to study the response of lake areas to climatic factors. The mean air temperature and precipitation were selected as compared series, and the lake areas were regarded as the reference series. The grey relational grade (GRG) between compared series and reference series were calculated through GRA. The results indicated that changes in lake areas were mainly affected by climatic factors in the hot season. Lakes in this region were classified into three grades, namely, Grades I, II, and III according to the recharge source and elevation. The GRGs of each series varied for different grade lakes: the area of Grade III lakes were the most relevant to the hot season factors, the GRGs of precipitation and air temperature were 0.7570 and 0.6606; followed by the Grade II lakes; Grade I lakes were more sensitive to the air temperature.

This study describes the species composition and quantitative distribution of polychaetes in the southern Caspian Sea and relates the distribution to seasonal changes in environmental parameters of water (temperature, salinity, and surface current speed) and sediments (organic matter and grain size composition) at four depths (2, 5, 9 and 14 m) on the Noshahr coast in the southern Caspian Sea in 2010. Four species were found: Alitta succinea, Hediste diversicolor, Hypania invalida, and Streblospio gynobranchiata. Among them, the non-indigenous S. gynobranchiata was the dominant species, accounting for 87% of the total abundance. Significant differences in abundance across the four species were observed among depths and seasons. Additionally, significant correlations between species abundances and the tested environmental factors were evident. This study highlights the potential consequences of established non-indigenous species in the southern Caspian Sea. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Choosing the most popular NFL games in a local TV market	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN SPORTS												This paper models the TV audience for NFL games in a market without a local team. The model is estimated using all NFL games shown in the Salt Lake City market over the last 10 years. Team popularity varies season to season, with fans preferring high-scoring close games between good teams. The primary motivation of the model was to advise the local station in week-to-week selection of high TV audience games from the slate of FOX games. In 2013 the most popular team was the San Francisco 49ers and the local station broadcast more of their games than any other team. While the predictions offer modest discrimination between popular games, the predicted error precision must be reduced to compete with local station expertise. Reviewing the prediction performance in 2013 reveals insight into strengths and weaknesses of predictive analytics in business decisions.																			2194-6388	1559-0410				SEP	2014	10	3					329	343		10.1515/jqas-2014-0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jqas-2014-0015													WOS:000443085500003

Samples were taken monthly from March 2007 through February 2008, in three strata (surface, middle and bottom). Bacterial and cladoceran densities were the variables most associated with HNF density. However, there was a gradual decoupling between HNF and bacteria from the subsurface to the bottom of the lake. Most likely, this was caused by high predation by cladocerans on HNF in the deeper layer. Our results suggest that the overwhelming dominance of a single type of control on HNF dynamics may be more the exception than the rule.

Historical reconstruction of sediment accumulation rates as an indicator of global change impacts in a tropical crater lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lakes are effective sentinels of global change owing to their sensitivity to land-use changes and climate variability in their catchment. Santa Maria del Oro Lake (SAMO, NW Mexico) is of interest both for global change studies and as a natural resource to sustain the economy of local communities. Four sediment cores were used to evaluate the temporal variations of sediment accumulation, under the hypothesis that changes in sediment input are mostly driven by anthropic activities developed in the lake surroundings. Radiocarbon (C-14) dating of SAMO sediments was precluded by a large and variable reservoir effect, inducing an age offset of similar to 4000 years. Well-constrained chronologies over the past century were obtained by Pb-210 dating, corroborated by the stratigraphic markers Cs-137, Pu239+240, and C-14-fraction modern. Geochemical, magnetic susceptibility, and meteorological data were used to elucidate the main controls of sedimentation processes in the lake. Mass accumulation rates were high, likely because of the natural vulnerability of catchment soils to hydric and aeolian erosion. The highest values, observed towards the lakeshore, were attributed to the influence of seasonal runoff from the surrounding steep hills, and the proximity of human settlements and agricultural fields. Mean mass accumulation rates increased with time (from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-2) year(-1) between 1900 and 1950, to 0.14 +/- 0.10 g cm(-2) year(-1) after the 1950s), although the most recent values were comparable to the mean values during the pre1950 period. Accumulation maxima across the lake, occurring mostly since the 1980s, concurred with precipitation minima and were related to terrigenous pulses associated with soil erosion, likely favored by lower soil humidity and the occurrence of wildfires during dryer years. Controls on the development of human settlement and agriculture practices should be included in the long-term environmental management plans for the conservation of the lake resources.					; Aquino López, Marco/AAX-4063-2021; Keaveney, E/AGR-1440-2022; Cardoso-Mohedano, Jose-Gilberto/S-6839-2018; Cardoso-Mohedano, J.

Combined effects of fish cage culture and increased fishing pressure on wild fish assemblages in a large reservoir, Yangtze River basin, China	AQUACULTURE												Local fishers often claim that cage culture practices in reservoirs result in high fish catches as fish cages attract a diverse variety of wild fish, which mainly aggregate to forage on waste from the practices. Previous studies have focused on fish aggregation effects brought about by fish cages. In the present study, we explored the responses of wild fish assemblages to fish cages and increased fishing pressure in the vicinity of cage farms in the Geheyan reservoir (110.80 degrees-111.22 degrees E, 30.35 degrees-30.48 degrees N) which located on the middle reaches of the Qingjiang River of the Yangtze River basin. Seasonal hydroacoustic surveys were conducted between April 2016 and January 2017 using a Simrad EY60 echosounder to determine the changes of fish assemblages along the density gradient of fish cages in the reservoir. Significant negative correlations between wild fish density and the density of fish cages were observed in April 2016 and January 2017. In other two seasons, we also found analogous trends. In general, the abundance of wild fish assemblages around fish cages declined resulting from increased fishing pressure in the reservoir. This study suggests that the commercial capture of indigenous fish around cage farms should be limited to protect the indigenous fish resources in reservoirs.					; Li, Zhongjie/J-1474-2018; Xiong, Mantang/GPX-0706-2022; Liu, Shengbo/JAZ-9733-2023	Xiong, Mantang/0000-0003-2444-4442; Wang, Qidong/0000-0003-2082-8457; 													0044-8486	1873-5622				SEP 15	2020	526								735373	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735373													WOS:000543491400004

This paper summarizes the contrasting probe technologies designed for each of these subglacial environments and briefly updates how these designs changed or were used differently when compared to previously published plans. A detailed update on the final engineering design and technical aspects of the probe for Subglacial Lake Ellsworth is presented. This probe is designed for clean access, is negatively buoyant (350 kg), 5.2 m long, 200 mm in diameter, approximately cylindrical and consists of five major units: (i) an upper power and communications unit attached to an optical and electrical conducting tether, (ii)-(iv) three water and particle samplers, and (v) a sensors, imaging and instrumentation pack tipped with a miniature sediment corer. To date, only in Subglacial Lake Whillans have instruments been successfully deployed. Probe technologies for Subglacial Lake Vostok (2014/15) and Lake Ellsworth (2012/13) were not deployed for technical reasons, in the case of Lake Ellsworth because hot-water drilling was unable to access the lake during the field season window. Lessons learned and opportunities for probe technologies in future subglacial access missions are discussed.

Reproductive ecology of two cyprinid fishes in an oligotrophic lake near the southern limits of their distribution range	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				The reproductive activities of two dominant fish species, roach Rutilus rutilus and rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus were investigated from August 2000 to July 2002 in an oligotrophic lake, Lake Sapanca, in the northwest of Turkey. A total of 907 roach and 593 rudd individuals were examined. Macroscopic appearance of ovary, gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter frequency distribution suggested that the spawning season of roach and rudd were from early April (13 degrees C) to late May (18 degrees C) and from early May (17.5 degrees C) to late June (23.5 degrees C), respectively. The spawning cycles of both species showed the same tendency in two successive years. The estimated mean total lengths at first maturity (L-T50) were 12.26 and 14.98 cm for male and female roach, respectively, and 7.12 and 8.10 cm for male and female rudd, respectively. The sizes at 50% maturity corresponded to 3 years for roach and 1 year for rudd, for both sexes. The ratio of males to females was 1.3:1 and 1.2:1 for roach and rudd, respectively. The average condition factor K was 1.21 for rudd and 1.14 for roach, and it was not affected by sex or reproductive effort. Absolute fecundity varied from 7829 to 95,387 eggs between ages 3 and 9 for roach and from 1807 to 35,629 eggs between ages 1 and 7 for rudd. Comparisons of these results with earlier studies from more northern regions revealed that spawning of both species in this area started earlier, but spawning temperature and the duration of spawning was approximately the same.

Reference is made to the major feature of the basin, that is, the Toker Delta spate irrigation scheme. A point-to-pixel comparison of gridded and ground-based data sets is performed to enhance the estimates of rainfall. Analysis of remotely sensed land use/cover data is performed. The results show a significant reduction of the grassland and barren areas explained by a significant expansion of the cropland and open shrubland (invasive mesquite trees) areas in the delta. The cotton sown area is highly dependent on the flooded area and the discharge volume in the delta. However, the area of this major crop has declined since the early 1990s in favour of cultivation of more profitable food crops. Expansion of mesquite in the delta is problematic, taking hold under increased floodwater, and can only be manged by clearance to provide crop cultivation area. There is a great potential for floodwater harvesting during the rainfall season (June to September). A total seasonal runoff volume of around 4.6 and 10.8 billion cubic metres is estimated at 90 and 50% probabilities of exceedance (reliabilities), respectively. Rather than leaving the runoff generated from rainfall events to pass to the Red Sea or be consumed by mesquite trees, a location for runoff harvesting structure in a highly suitable area is proposed. Such a structure will support any policy shifts towards planning and managing the basin water resources for use in irrigating the agricultural scheme.

Modelling CH4 emissions from arctic wetlands:: effects of hydrological parameterization	BIOGEOSCIENCES												This study compares the CH4 fluxes from two arctic wetland sites of different annual temperatures during 2004 to 2006. The PEATLAND-VU model was used to simulate the emissions. The CH4 module of PEATLAND-VU is based on the Walter-Heimann model. The first site is located in northeast Siberia, Indigirka lowlands, Kytalyk reserve (70 degrees N, 147 degrees E) in a continuous permafrost region with mean annual temperatures of -14.3 degrees C. The other site is Stordalen mire in the eastern part of Lake Tornetrask (68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) ten kilometres east of Abisko, northern Sweden. It is located in a discontinuous permafrost region. Stordalen has a sub arctic climate with a mean annual temperature of -0.7 degrees C. Model input consisted of observed temperature, precipitation and snow cover data. In all cases, modelled CH4 emissions show a direct correlation between variations in water table and soil temperature variations. The differences in CH4 emissions between the two sites are caused by different climate, hydrology, soil physical properties, vegetation type and NPP. For Kytalyk the simulated CH4 fluxes show similar trends during the growing season, having average values for 2004 to 2006 between 1.29-2.09 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1). At Stordalen the simulated fluxes show a slightly lower average value for the same years (3.52 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1)) than the observed 4.7 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1). The effect of the longer growing season at Stordalen is simulated correctly. Our study shows that modelling of arctic CH4 fluxes is improved by adding a relatively simple hydrological model that simulates the water table position from generic weather data. Our results support the generalization in literature that CH4 fluxes in northern wetland are regulated more tightly by water table than temperature. Furthermore, parameter uncertainty at site level in wetland CH4 process models is an important factor in large scale modelling of CH4 fluxes.					; Maximov, Trofim/J-8964-2016; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Yurova, Alla/A-5767-2014	Christensen, Torben R./0000-0002-4917-148X; Yurova, Alla/0000-0001-6199-414X; Petrescu, A.

We used a corer and a Downing box sampler to sample macroinvertebrates living on and beneath the introduced Trapa natans and the native Vallisneria americana in the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York. 2. Densities of macroinvertebrates were higher in Trapa than in Vallisneria, and higher in the interior of plant beds than at their edges. These effects were largely a result of high plant biomass in Trapa beds and in bed interiors (the plants have similar surface area per unit mass). 3. The composition of both epiphytic and benthic macroinvertebrates differed distinctly between Trapa and Vallisneria, and also seasonally. 4. These compositional differences were not easily interpretable as rising from possible differences in oxygen concentrations, fish predation, or water circulation in the two macrophytes. 5. Sida crystallina (Cladocera) collected from Trapa contained more haemoglobin than those collected from Vallisneria. 6. The replacement of Vallisneria by Trapa in the Hudson probably increased system-wide biodiversity and food for fish, although macroinvertebrates in Trapa beds may not be readily available to fish because of low oxygen concentration there.					; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011	Strayer, David/0000-0002-6767-4486; 													0046-5070					NOV	2003	48	11					1938	1949		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01142.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01142.x													WOS:000186119300002
J	Shuman, B; Thompson, W III; Bartlein, P; Williams, JW				Shuman, B; Thompson, W III; Bartlein, P; Williams, JW			The anatomy of a climatic oscillation: vegetation change in eastern North America during the Younger Dryas chronozone	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Century-scale climate changes reshaped circulation patterns over the North Atlantic and adjacent regions during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition. Here, we show that vegetation across eastern North America shifted dramatically at the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas chronozone (YDC: 12,900-11,600 cal yr B.P.), when changes in ocean circulation rapidly cooled and then warmed the North Atlantic sea-surface. On both the site-specific scale and the continental-scale, vegetation changed only gradually during the millennia before (15,000-13,000 cal yr B.P.) and after (11,000-9000 cal yr B.P.) the YDC, but climate changes ca 12,900 and 11,600 cal yr B.P. altered the vegetation on both spatial scales within centuries. Plant associations changed and some taxa rapidly migrated hundreds of kilometers (>300km within similar to100yr). In limited regions near the North Atlantic coast, abrupt cooling ca 12,900 cal yr B.P. resulted in a return to earlier vegetation types. Elsewhere, however, the vegetation patterns during the YDC were distinct from those of both earlier and later intervals. They indicate abrupt, 'non-reversing' seasonal temperature changes that were probably related to atmospheric circulation changes during the YDC, rather than to the direct influence of North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures. Atmospheric circulation patterns during the YDC were unique within the last 21,000yr because of a unique combination of climate controls. Insolation, ice sheet extent, and atmospheric composition were significantly different from their full-glacial states, even when the North Atlantic returned to near full-glacial conditions. The YDC vegetation patterns demonstrate (1) rapid ecological responsiveness to abrupt climate change and (2) spatially varied patterns of YDC climate change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the present study, freshwater fish species of the lower catchment of the river were investigated for the use of assessing the water quality. Cast net sampling and identification recorded 34 freshwater fish species from the lower catchment, the majority represented by family Cyprinidae. Fish species richness, diversity indices, distribution, abundance and the regression analysis of fish species with water quality parameters revealed high sensitivity and tolerance of three fish species with certain water quality parameters. Dawkinsia singhala was tolerant to the fluctuations of the chemical parameters of the water, while Rasbora daniconius and Pethia reval were tolerant to the physical parameters. Positive correlations were evident between the ammonium and phosphate concentrations of the water and distribution and abundance of D. singhala, while R. daniconius and P. reval showed positive correlations with turbidity of water and pH value respectively. Furthermore, the study reveals that D. singhala is more suitable for predicting the water quality of urban and peri-urban locations of the river, while P. reval and R. daniconius are more suitable for assessing the water quality of rural locations. Thus, the present study reveals a strong possibility of using D. singhala, R. daniconius and P. reval, as biological indicators for assessing the variation of water quality of the lower catchment of the Kelani River. However, despite the fact that such a study has been conducted for the first time in Sri Lanka, it is restrained by certain limitations, and seasonal variations of water quality parameters with fish parameters, adaptations inherent to fish species and food availability in different locations combined with long-term monitoring of fish assemblages have not been considered. Future studies investigating these aspects will further enhance the value of the study.

In total, 13 species of benthic foraminifera represented by eight families were identified in the lagoon. The stations in the Southern sector of the lagoon showed relatively low foraminifera abundance yet high diversity whereas higher abundance and lower diversity were observed in stations located in the Central sector which indicates the spatial patterning of the assemblage. Live foraminifera abundance was sparse in the study area indicating the stressed nature of the lagoon environment. The dissolved nutrient concentration of bottom water reflected significant seasonal variation. The stressed nature of the lagoon is further indicated by the dominance of the genus Ammonia across the inner sectors of the lagoon, a genus known to inhabit impacted habitats. Overall these data can serve as a baseline proxy for understanding palaeontological assemblages of foraminifera in similar shallow-water settings globally.					; Bhadury, Punyasloke/A-2355-2008; RASTOGI, GURDEEP/AAQ-5076-2021	Gupta, Vandana Kumari/0000-0003-3185-8555; 													0025-3154	1469-7769				MAR	2019	99	2					311	330		10.1017/S0025315418000085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315418000085													WOS:000462532100006

The delta O-18(diatom) record is supported by a lower resolution deuterium (delta D-pa)isotope curve derived from palmitic acid. We interpret these isotope data in terms of major shifts in precipitation and evaporation moderated by seasonal controls on the host organisms. Dry periods marked by relatively positive isotope values, represent the extension of abrupt Holocene events noted from northern and equatorial Africa to 10-15 degrees S. These events in Lake Malawi correspond to cool episodes in Greenland, thereby demonstrating teleconnections generated by meridional temperature gradients. Sea surface temperatures are likely to be the primary transmitter of deglacial climate changes, although trade wind strength and direction is critical in controlling precipitation patterns in tropical regions. Conversely, the global hydrological cycle, driven by low latitude regions represents an important positive feedback amplifying deglacial processes. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Measured concentrations in bulk depositions ranged from 1.1 to 222 ng l(-1) with an average of 71.5 ng l(-1). The most prevalent PAHs are phenanthrene. fluoranthene and pyrene, which represent 60% of the total concentration on average. The potentially carcinogenic PAHs represent 22% of the PAH concentrations. Statistical analysis, in particular principal component analysis (PCA), allowed us to analyse this data set, highlighting the influence of meteorological parameters (temperature. precipitation amount) on PAH concentration, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The temperature played an important role for PAH concentration in bulk deposition and influenced the efficiency of washout, while rainfall amounts seemed to have a minor influence. Thus, we found seasonal trends in PAH concentration. High rainfall correlated with high proportions of light PAHs. Finally, the study of wind directions allowed us to localize sources of PAHs and to estimate their respective contribution. The influence of the urban area of Rouen on PAH concentrations measured at Evreux is emphasized. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Kozak, A; Goldyn, R				Kozak, Anna; Goldyn, Ryszard			Macrophyte response to the protection and restoration measures of four water bodies	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Macrophytes are a good long-term indicator of quality of aquatic ecosystems and are essential for the proper functioning of the entire lake ecosystem. Submerged vegetation is considered to be indicative of an improvement of the ecological status of these lakes. Here, we analyzed the distribution, structure, and diversity of vegetation communities in four eutrophic water bodies (postglacial lakes: Sawskie and Uzarzewskie and man-made lakes: Maltaski Reservoir and Turawa rednia Reservoir) after the application of restauration and protections measures. The restoration measures included biomanipulation, phosphorus inactivation, hypolimnion aeration, or injection of nitrate-rich waters to the hypolimnion. All of them were sustainable and did not cause drastic changes in the ecosystem. Between 9 and 17 macrophyte communities were found in the examined water bodies. The largest effects were observed after the simultaneous use of three lake restoration techniques which led to the appearance of 17% charophytes. Pronounced effects leading to the higher contribution of elodeids to the macrophyte community were achieved in the lake in which two methods were applied. Least effective was the method focused on hypolimnion restoration in a small lake, which did not cause the reappearance of submerged vegetation. Spontaneous recovery achieving good status is also possible in a large lake in case of applying the thorough conservation measures. An intensive growth and diversity of macrophytes was a result of the improvement in the water quality as a consequence of undertaken protective activities and/or restoration measures. However, the re-colonization of submerged macrophytes during restoration process is not obvious and the feed-back mechanisms may delay a response of the ecosystem. The vegetation of the studied lakes was unstable, showing high variability in individual years of research, which indicates that these ecosystems are still under reconstruction and not reach equilibrium state yet.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; 													1434-2944	1522-2632				DEC	2016	101	5-6					160	172		10.1002/iroh.201601839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201601839													WOS:000389313900002

REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF PORTUNUS PELAGICUS IN A SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIAN ESTUARY	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Portunus pelagicus (blue swimmer crab) is widely distributed and fished throughout the indo-west Pacific, but little is known of its biology and ecology in southeast Australia. In this study, the reproductive biology of P. pelagicus inhabiting Wallis Lake, a large coastal lake that supports the largest regional commercial fishery for the species was investigated. Males and females with mature gonads occur throughout the fishing season (November to July), however, ovigerous females are most prevalent in November and December. The mean size at which 50% of females reached maturity is estimated at 46 mm carapace length (CL). Fecundity increased linearly with CL and females are capable of producing up to 3 broods of eggs within the observed spawning season, with crabs of 60-69 mm CL producing approximately 76% of the estimated total egg production. Increasing the current minimum carapace length above 60 mm CL would potentially provide greater protection to mature females and increase total egg production, but this would reduce total retained catches in the fisheries.

Based on well-constructed sporopollen, sediment grain size analysis, magnetic susceptibility, and iron oxide analysis of the 2000-2001 excavated section, four stages of environmental change in the Nihewan Beds are identified by the authors. The results indicate four major stages of environment and climate change from 1) warm and humid forest grass to 2) temperate and humid forest grass to 3) temperate and dry forest grass to 4) warm and humid forest, which is suitable for hominid occupation. The changes correspond to the stages of lake transgression and regression. The environment after the lake died out away has been cold and dry boschveld. The hominid activities at the site took place in the Early Pleistocene (1.10 Ma), which corresponds to the early three environmental stages. Therefore, it can be inferred that the early hominids adapted to the relatively low lake level episodes through activities involving sporadic stone tool making, procuring of raw materials for tools, concentrating stone artifacts, and hunting and butchering. In conclusion, the results will be of great significance to research regarding the relationship between hominid occupation and environmental changes as well as the adaptive behaviors of early humans at the Donggutuo site.

ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Alpine lakes are often highly transparent to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which has led to the Suggestion that it deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) results in these systems from UV avoidance by phytoplankton. However, ail alternative explanation is that the formation of the DCM is primarily driven by greater nutrient availability below the thermocline in these oligotrophic systems. We investigated the location of the chlorophyll maximum over spatial and temporal scales in it set of high-elevation lakes in the Beartooth Mountains (Montana/Wyoming). The position of the DCM was compared to a suite of physical and chemical variables across systems. Chlorophyll was strongly correlated to it suite of nitrogen variables, whereas correlations with UV parameters were not consistently observed. We also conducted an experiment with the natural phytoplankton assemblage from the DCM in Beartooth Lake; both UV exposure and nutrient additions were tested in it factorial design. The UV-exposed treatment and the control had the same final total phytoplankton biovolume, while the nutrient addition treatment had a final biovolume tell times as great. These results Suggest that, its in other oligotrophic aquatic systems, greater nutrient availability in the hypolimnion leads to the development of the DCM in alpine lakes.																			1523-0430					NOV	2005	37	4					557	563		10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0557:ATDCMI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0557:ATDCMI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000233757800017

The bacterial communities were divided into three subgroups: bacteria with very high nucleic acid contents (VHNA bacteria), bacteria with high nucleic acid contents (HNA bacteria), and bacteria with low nucleic acid contents (LNA bacteria). During the thermal stratification period, the relative abundance of VHNA bacteria (%VHNA) increased with depth, while the reverse trend was evident for LNA bacteria. Seasonally, the %VHNA was strongly positively correlated (r = 0.87; P < 0.001) with the concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus, but not with the concentration of chlorophyll a. The growth of VHNA bacteria was significantly enhanced by addition of phosphate or phosphate plus glucose but not by addition of glucose alone. Although the growth of VHNA and HNA bacteria generally exceeded that of LNA bacteria, our data also revealed that LNA bacteria grew faster than and were grazed as fast as VHNA bacteria in late August, when nutrient limitation was presumably severe. Based on these results, we hypothesize that in severely P-limited environments such as Lake Biwa, P limitation exerts more severe constraints on the growth of bacterial groups with higher nucleic acid contents, which allows LNA bacteria to be competitive and become an important component of the microbial loop.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				OCT	2005	71	10					5828	5836		10.1128/AEM.71.10.5828-5836.2005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.10.5828-5836.2005								16204494					WOS:000232504000021

In this study, a soil seed bank experiment was carried out along a water level gradient for the Lake Lashi wetland in the Northwest Yunnan Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect, driver and dynamic mechanism of dam impoundment on the soil seed bank of plateau wetlands using partial least squares (PLS) regression and chaotic dynamic methods. The results showed that the soil seed bank had significant differences in seed density, species composition, and water ecotype of the plant species between the flood zone (perennially flooded area, seasonally flooded area, and flood plain area) and nonflood zone (control area) in the plateau wetland. The seed bank density was obviously lower in the perennially flooded area and higher in the seasonally flooded area and flood plain area, with values that were 39.88%, 153.53%, and 146.47% that of the control area, respectively. After dam impoundment, the number of plant species gradually increased; however, the dominance of the dominant species became less obvious, and the species diversity indices decreased significantly, e.g., by 15.47% for the Simpson diversity index and 72.39% for the Shannon Wiener diversity index. Our study showed that dam impoundment has made the Lake Lashi wetland complex chaotic ecosystem switch between order and disorder through self-organization and that the species composition of the soil seed bank continuously experienced self-adaptation. These results provide a reference for scientific evaluations of the effects of dam impoundment on wetland ecosystems and provide guidance for the protection and management of plateau wetland ecosystems.

Materials and methods: The archives of the Refugee Hospital of Veria, Imathia were examined (March 5, 1926 to October 27, 1940); this is a report of previously unpublished primary material comprising 15,921 cases, of whom 8,408 patients were hospitalized due to malaria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for hospitalization due to malaria; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results: Residence in lower elevation (adjusted OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.97, per increments of elevation), refugee status (from Bulgaria/Balkans, Caucasus, Constantinople and Thrace, Pontus and inland of Turkey), female gender, and younger age (adjusted OR per 10-year increase = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.86-0.90) correlated independently with hospitalization due to malaria. Conclusions: Malaria was the leading cause of admission to the hospital in the region of Imathia during the studied period. The association with elevation reflects the aggravating role of marshes before the drainage of Lake Giannitsa.

Feeding selectivity of slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus and deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii in southeast Lake Michigan: Implications for species coexistence	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Feeding selectivity was compared between slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus and deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii collected from southeast Lake Michigan during 1999-2002 to evaluate the hypothesis that differential prey selection contributes to long-term coexistence of these species. Study results indicated that slimy and deepwater sculpin select different prey types and sizes. Selection for the shrimp-like crustacean Mysis diluviana was consistently greater for deepwater sculpin than for slimy sculpin, whereas selection for the amphipod Diporeia spp. was higher for slimy sculpin than for deepwater sculpin when Mysis was the only other available prey type. Slimy sculpin also exhibited higher selectivity for chironomids (order Diptera, family Chironomidae) compared with deepwater sculpin. Patterns in food resource partitioning were consistent between sampling periods covering different locations, seasons and depths, as well as between locations with varying levels of Diporeia availability. This consistency suggests (1) that differences in food use by the two species are associated with intrinsic differences in food preferences or feeding behaviors and (2) that Diporeia declines had not fundamentally altered the resource partitioning dynamics of the two species as of 2002. The results also indicated that slimy and deepwater sculpin can partition food resources on the basis of prey size since deepwater sculpin tended to select larger Diporeia than slimy sculpin. Differences in prey selection may mediate competitive interactions between slimy and deepwater sculpin directly by reducing diet overlap in areas of sympatry or indirectly by causing these fish to select different depth habitats.

Four energy sources (seston, bottom sediment, periphyton, and aquatic macrophytes) and macroinvertebrate communities were collected during three periods of the river hydrological cycle. Macroinvertebrates showed greater temporal variation in isotope values than their food sources. Six trophic chains were identified: four were based on seston, periphyton, C-3 macrophytes, and bottom sediments, and the last two chains on a combination of two carbon sources. One mixed seston and periphyton sources during the wet season while the other mixed periphyton and macrophytes sources during the wet and dry seasons. Periphyton was the most important energy source supporting the highest number of trophic levels and consumers. The macrophytic contribution was only significant during the dry season. Bottom sediments constituted a marginal energy source. As each season is associated with different physical and chemical conditions, processes organizing macroinvertebrate food web structure in the Beni floodplain seem strongly linked to hydrological seasonality.					; Molina, Carlos/AAI-9839-2020; oberdorff, thierry/I-3109-2016; Oberdorff, Thierry/I-3109-2016	Molina, Carlos I./0000-0002-4191-7451; Gibon, Francois-Marie/0000-0003-4443-0478; Oberdorff, Thierry/0000-0001-7323-2599													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2011	663	1					135	153		10.1007/s10750-010-0565-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0565-4													WOS:000286393300009

The water table underlying the Sand Hills is part of the High Plains/Ogallala aquifer, an important water resource for the central Great Plains. Lake levels are affected directly by fluctuations in the water table, which is recharged primarily by local precipitation and responds quickly to climatically induced changes in regional water balance. Instrumental records are available for only 50-100 years, and paleolimnological data provide important insights into the extremes and variability in moisture balance over longer time scales. A set of 69 lakes from across Nebraska was used to establish a statistical relationship between diatom community composition and water depth. This relationship was then used to develop a diatom-based inference model for water depth using weighted averaging regression and calibration techniques. Development of the inference model was complicated by strong intra-seasonal variability in water depth and the linkages between depth and other limnologic characteristics, including alkalinity, water clarity and nutrient concentrations. Analysis of historical diatom communities from eight lakes allowed for the reconstruction of lake-level fluctuations over the past several thousand years. Comparisons of the more recent portion of these reconstructions with the instrumental Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) showed that sediment records may not faithfully reflect short-term fluctuations in water level, except where sedimentation rates are very high. However, large and persistent changes in moisture availability were discernible even in longer, low-resolution records. Thus, diatoms are a useful addition to the tools available for understanding past drought in the central Great Plains, especially when trajectories of change are constrained by data from multiple sites or other proxies.

Lagoon water-level oscillations driven by rainfall and wave climate	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Barrier breaching and subsequent inlet formation represent critical processes that ensure the temporary or permanent connection and transference of water, nutrients, or living organisms between a lagoon and the open sea. Here, we investigate the conditions inducing natural barrier breaching through a 34 months monitoring program of water-level oscillations within a shallow lagoon and the adjacent nearshore, at the Northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, Louro lagoon. Seven natural openings were identified to have occurred during the three monitored wet seasons, from the 2009 to 2012, (Wet1, Wet2 and Wet3); four in the Wetl, two in the Wet2 and one in. the Wet3. The openings were grouped in three types depending on the observed relation between the lagoon water-level (L-wl), the estimated berm height (B-h) and the water-level at the beach (B-wl): (i) openings by lagoon outflow, which include those characterized by L-wl higher than B-h and lower B-wl; (ii) openings by wave inundation, including those induced by B-wl higher than B-h, and (iii) mixed openings, which result from a combination of the two previous conditions. We observed that L-wl is modulated by the rainfall regime (R-f) and can be explained by the accumulated precipitation. We estimated applying runup equations to obtain B-h and B-wl which depend on the wave climate and tidal level. The inlet lifespan was found to be regulated by the wave climate and rainfall regime; in particular barrier sealing was associated with a sudden increase in wave period and a reduction in precipitation. This work proves that the natural openings could be predicted successfully with support to medium term water-level monitoring programs, which in turn may significantly contribute to strategic decision making for management and conservation purposes.					; Gonzalez-Villanueva, Rita/G-7409-2015; Perez-Arlucea, Marta/M-1825-2014; Costas, Susana/AAW-6281-2020; González-Villanueva, Rita/G-7409-2015; Perez-Arlucea, Marta/O-3865-2019	Costas, Susana/0000-0002-4005-077X; Gonzalez-Villanueva, Rita/0000-0002-6583-2348; Perez-Arlucea, Marta/0000-0002-4592-3314; 													0378-3839	1872-7379				DEC	2017	130						34	45		10.1016/j.coastaleng.2017.09.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2017.09.013													WOS:000416196200004
J	Gürevin, C; Erturk, A; Albay, M				Gurevin, Cenk; Erturk, Ali; Albay, Meric			Predicting the effects of sediment based internal nutrient loads on eutrophication in Kucukcekmece Lagoon for rehabilitation planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												In deep stratified coastal lagoons, hypoxic waters that result from phytoplankton decomposition in the stratified bottom waters are often associated with eutrophication. Decomposing biomass reaches the bottom sediments and enriches them with nutrients and organic matter. Nutrients trapped in sediments are released with time and promote excessive phytoplankton growth in the surface water. Because eutrophication in lentic ecosystems progresses in a self-fuelling cycle, outflow is the only available process for exporting excess nutrients to recover from eutrophication. Thus, rehabilitation of eutrophic coastal lagoons that have limited seawater interactions is a long term process. The importance of nutrient release from sediments on eutrophication and the delay effect of internal nutrient loading on the rehabilitation of a eutrophic coastal lagoon with limited seawater exchange were analysed in this study. An ecological model that couples the water column and the sediment diagenesis processes, was developed for water quality management purposes. Our findings indicate that the recovery of the Lagoon from eutrophication will be taken decades even in the absence of external nutrient loading. Therefore, we suggest applying rehabilitation strategies that control the nutrient fluxes from sediments for a faster recovery from heavily eutrophic conditions. Land-based nutrient sources must also be controlled because they feed water column and the bottom sediments with nutrients.

Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been widely used to develop numerous semiempirical models all over the world. In this paper, many of these models perform satisfactorily either in a single water body or in many similar turbid water environments, however, their performance drops when data from oligo-to-eutrophic environments are used to monitor all reservoirs simultaneously. Most of them tend to overestimate TSMat low concentration. Two separate model calibrations were used to monitor the spatio-temporal variability of TSM in two oligo-to-eutrophic reservoirs, Nova Avanhandava (Nav) and Barra Bonita (BB), situated in the cascade system of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The exponential model using MODIS band 1 yielded the best accuracy for BB (RMSE = 3.66 mg/L) and MODIS band 1 based linear model showed the best performance for Nav (RMSE = 0.37 mg/L). The distribution of TSM in Nav showed comparatively low and homogenous concentrations for the entire reservoir but the magnitude doubled for a period between May and October. The same seasonal variability occurred in BB showing increased TSM trend in October compared to May, but the spatial variability was not homogeneous because of the runoff from Piracicaba River, which is the main contributor of TSM. Rainfall associated runoff and land use and land cover were the principal factors for TSM variability.

J	Szymanek, M				Szymanek, Marcin			Palaeotemperature estimation in the Holsteinian Interglacial (MIS 11) based on oxygen isotopes of aquatic gastropods from eastern Poland	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												For quantitative estimation of past water temperature of four Holsteinian (MIS 11) palaeolakes from eastern Poland, the oxygen isotope palaeothermometer was applied to shells of the aquatic gastropods Viviparus diluvianus and Valvata piscinalis. The delta O-18 composition of their shells demonstrated the average growth-season water temperatures during the mesocratic stage of the interglacial (Ortel Krolewski Lake), during its climatic optimum - the Carpinus-Abies Zone (Ossowka-Hrud, Roskosz and Szymanowo Lakes), and in the post-optimum (Szymanowo Lake). The calculation was based on delta O-18(Shell) values and the delta O-18(Water) assumed for the Holsteinian from the modern oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and the expected amount of evaporative enrichment. The mean oxygen isotope palaeotemperatures of Ortel Krolewski lake waters were in the range of 18.1-21.9 degrees C and were uniform for the Taxus and Pinus-Larix zones. Ossowka-Hrud and Roskosz Lakes had mean temperatures of 17.4-21.0 degrees C during the climatic optimum, whereas the temperature of Szymanowo lake waters was estimated at 20.6-21.7 degrees C at that time. These values are concordant with the pollen-inferred July air temperatures noted during the Holsteinian in eastern Poland. Relatively high values of similar to 25 degrees C in the post-optimum noted at Szymanowo were connected with the presence of a shallow and warm isolated bay indicated by pollen and mollusc records.

Dispersal of sea lamprey larvae during early life: relevance for recruitment dynamics	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Dispersal is an important early life history process that influences fish population dynamics and recruitment. We studied larval sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus) dispersal by combining spatially explicit field sampling, genetic methods, and laboratory experiments to investigate how far sea lamprey larvae can disperse away from nests during their first growing season; subsequent dispersal by age 1 of sea lamprey; and the effect of density on larval dispersal. In two study streams sea lamprey larvae were observed to have moved > 150 m downstream from the most likely source nest within 2 - 3 weeks of hatching. Conversely, randomization trials suggested that for both streams age 0 larvae were found closer to full siblings than would be expected if dispersal was not constrained by distance. Restricted dispersal was also observed for age 1 larvae in five streams, although for this age class full siblings were more commonly found to be separated by > 1,000 m. Laboratory experiments indicated a significant effect of density on the movement of larval sea lamprey, with more larval movement at higher densities. Temperature also affected movement significantly, with reduced larval movements at cooler temperatures. Our findings suggest that larval sea lamprey dispersal is sufficient to minimize the likelihood of strong density-dependent effects on recruitment, even with large population sizes.																			0378-1909					MAR	2007	78	3					271	284		10.1007/s10641-006-9095-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9095-3													WOS:000244190500014
J	Barkan, E; Fishman, E; Affek, HP				Barkan, Eugeni; Fishman, Ekaterina; Affek, Hagit P.			The effect of salinity on water 17O/16O ratios in brines	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Closed-basin lakes respond strongly to climate related changes in their water balance. Lake water isotopic composition can thus serve as a sensitive indicator of paleo-hydrological conditions. Such lakes are often highly saline, so that the effect of salinity on the isotopic composition of lake water has to be accounted for in analyzing lake water evaporation and lake sediment isotopic records. Whereas the effect of salinity on delta O-18 has been well characterized, this has not been done for the emerging proxy O-17(excess) [O-17(excess) = 106[ln(10(-3)delta O-17 + 1) - 0.528 ln(10(-3)delta O-18 + 1)]. To this end, we measured for the first time delta O-17 and delta O-18 of water in NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 solutions of a wide range of concentrations (1 to 4 molal), using CO2-H2O isotope exchange at 25 C. The results show that although both delta O-18 and delta O-17 are sensitive to salinity, O-17 excess is independent of salinity. Therefore, when analyzing lake water composition, the effect of salinity on delta O-18 and delta O-17 has to be accounted for, whereas 17Oexcess remains unchanged. These findings have important implications when studying evaporation in hypersaline lakes and for reconstructions of past water balance in saline closed-basin lakes. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Late Cretaceous fluvial hydrology and dinosaur behavior in southern Utah, USA: Insights from stable isotopes of biogenic carbonate	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the Late Cretaceous, North America was flooded by the epieric Western Interior Seaway. Mountain building events on the western landmass fed sediment to broad, low relief fluvial systems, which preserve rich dinosaur-bearing fossil assemblages. In this study, stable isotope ratios of associated vertebrate and invertebrate material from the Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah are used to investigate the nature of these hydrological systems and behavior of dinosaurs over these landscapes. Differences in stable isotope ratios of gar ganoine, enamel from hadrosaurid teeth, and authigenic micrite, in conjunction with previously published bivalve data, indicate a tripartite fluvial system consisting of large rivers draining upland areas, smaller streams draining the foreland basin, and lakes subject to unusual patterns of recharge. Specifically, mixing of water from large rivers and lakes occurred during seasonal flooding events analogous to processes taking place in modernday Tonle Sap Lake in central Cambodia. Episodic flooding created heterogeneity among soils, with those proximal to permanent lake shores saturated for a longer period of time compared to more distal localities. Hadrosaurids consuming vegetation closer to lake shores have higher carbon isotope ratios in their tooth enamel than hadrosaurids consuming vegetation from more distal areas suggesting a difference in habitat use. Thus, variations in the paleohydrology of these fluvial systems appear to have played an important role in determining the distribution of dinosaurs over the Kaiparowits floodplain.

Genotype predicts quantitative song variety in a chickadee hybrid zone despite limited sampling	ORNITHOLOGY												In the avian suborder Passeri (the songbirds), song develops according to both a flexible neural template and auditory input from conspecifics, making innately constrained characters of song difficult to isolate. In a hybridizing population of Poecile atricapillus (Black-capped Chickadee) and P. carolinensis (Carolina Chickadee), we found that genetic ancestry was weakly predictive of a multidimensional measure of song variety (a continuously distributed quantitative alternative to categorical song repertoire size) but did not successfully predict one-dimensional song variety. We used species-diagnostic autosomal markers to genotype 55 individuals inside and outside of the atricapillus/carolinensis hybrid zone in Missouri and Kansas. Using active recording methods, we then obtained high-volume, high-quality song recordings of 10 genotyped chickadees from a single hybrid zone population on a small, lake-bounded peninsula in west-central Missouri. We extracted acoustic data from these recordings to generate measurements of song variety across 1, 2, and 3 dimensions of multivariate acoustic space for each individual. We tested how well, and in what direction, genetic ancestry predicted song variety for each of these dimensionalities, after predicting that song variety would increase with carolinensis ancestry. Linear models predicting song variety in 2 and 3 dimensions from genetic ancestry ranging from carolinensis-like backcrosses to pure carolinensis explained 41% and 43% of the variation, respectively, with slope values in the predicted direction, suggestive of genetic predispositions for multidimensional song variety although p-values fall marginally short of classical thresholds of statistical significance. A linear model predicting song variety in 1 dimension from genetic ancestry explained 12% of the variation and did not approach statistical significance. Our findings provide support for the continued use of multidimensional song variety measurements and offer future directions for tackling the question of the genotype-song relationship in hybrid zones between species with vocal learning. In the avian suborder Passeri (known colloquially as songbirds), learning from conspecifics plays a role in the development of species-typical song. Poecile atricapillus (Black-capped Chickadees) and P. carolinensis (Carolina Chickadees), two songbirds that hybridize in a contact zone across the eastern United States, have distinct songs in allopatry but not in sympatry, likely due to the influence of cultural transmission within the hybrid zone. Previous work in the atricapillus/carolinensis hybrid zone has shown no association between song and genetic ancestry. Considering that allopatric atricapillus have remarkably stereotyped songs, and allopatric carolinensis show more individual- and population-level song variation, we predicted that chickadees' ability to vary their songs acoustically may be genetically constrained despite the homogenizing effect of cultural transmission on chickadee song in the hybrid zone. In a Missouri atricapillus/carolinensis hybrid zone population, we found that genetic ancestry was predictive of multidimensional measures of song variety but not one-dimensional song variety. En el suborden aviar Passeri (las aves canoras), el canto se desarrolla tanto a partir de un patr & oacute;n neuronal flexible como del aporte auditivo provenientes de los cong & eacute;neres.

Los modelos lineales que predec & iacute;an la variedad del canto en 2 y 3 dimensiones a partir de la ascendencia gen & eacute;tica, que iba desde retro-cruzas parecidas a carolinensis hasta individuos carolinensis puros, explicaron el 41% y el 43% de la variaci & oacute;n, respectivamente, con valores de pendiente en la direcci & oacute;n esperada, lo que sugiere una predisposici & oacute;n gen & eacute;tica para la variedad multidimensional del canto, aunque los valores de p estuvieron marginalmente por debajo de los umbrales cl & aacute;sicos de significancia estad & iacute;stica.

Sperm Quality of Hatchery-Reared Lake Trout Throughout the Spawning Season	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												The objective of this study was to investigate variation in sperm quality metrics (motility, velocity, linearity, longevity, and density) of hatchery-reared Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush throughout the spawning season. Seasonal variation in sperm quality was investigated using both a regression and repeated-measures approach. Sperm was collected from the same 16 individuals over four sampling periods, separated by 3-week intervals. Regression analyses showed that 727% of the variation in sperm traits could be explained by seasonal variation, indicating that seasonality can have a significant impact on the quality of sperm. Significant positive linear relationships were found for percent motility and linearity at 5s postactivation. Significant negative quadratic relationships were found for velocity at 5s postactivation, longevity, and density, whereas a positive quadratic relationship was found for linearity at 10s postactivation. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed a significant effect of season for percent motility and linearity at 5 and 10s postactivation, velocity at 10s postactivation, and longevity. Our findings are important for optimizing fertilization protocols for hatchery production and can also be used to understand reproductive biology and ecology of wild Lake Trout stocks.

Impacts of hydrodynamics and benthic communities on phytoplankton distributions in a large, dreissenid-colonized lake (Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada)	INLAND WATERS												We quantified the vertical and horizontal variation of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) to test how benthic filter feeders (dreissenid mussels), rooted macrophytes, and hydrodynamics influence phytoplankton distributions in a large lake (Lake Simcoe, Canada). Water column Chl-a did not differ significantly among sites of different depth, distance offshore, or rooted macrophyte biomass, but among the nearshore sites (7.5-10 m deep) it was higher where mussel biomass was greater. This counterintuitive result may be explained by wind-driven horizontal circulation during our specific study periods together with the patchy distribution of the mussels in the lake. Information on mixing depths, vertical eddy diffusivity, and mussel biomass was used to predict when and where the grazing pressure of mussels would likely deplete near-bottom phytoplankton. Chl-a depletion was frequently predicted at sites with moderate or high mussel biomass and sufficient thermal stratification to impede vertical mixing but never at sites without thermal stratification. Observations were consistent with predictions in most cases. The results suggested that mussels at depths of 7.5-15 m (a depth range of generally high mussel biomass in the lake) may frequently suffer food limitation due to near-bottom depletion during the early and middle stratified season. A deep Chl-a maximum was documented and may be important for mussel nutrition at such times.

Taking advantage of the long-term ecological data available from polymictic Lake Muggelsee (Germany) at weekly temporal scales, we tested whether dynamic factor analysis (DFA), a dimension-reduction technique especially designed for time series with data gaps, was able to reproduce the same underlying patterns if the resolution of the observations was artificially reduced from weekly to once every 2 or 4 weeks (2-weekly or 4-weekly, respectively) and whether the same results were obtained for different variables (water temperature, water chemistry, and plankton). As expected, the reduction in data resolution and the addition of gaps increased the amount of variance in our case studies; however, water temperature patterns, which generally vary only slowly if considered at broader temporal scales, were represented well in the 4-weekly data model. By contrast, total algal biomass and nutrient dynamics, which usually fluctuate more rapidly, were not. We further assessed the representativeness of spot samples taken by selection at 4-weekly and seasonal intervals compared to samples obtained by averaging the weekly data over these 2 intervals. In this case, the resulting observation variance was more pronounced in DFA models of the samples taken by selection than of those obtained by averaging. The introduction of additional artificial gaps in one univariate and one multivariate model decreased the amount of information that could be explained by the pattern(s) extracted by DFA. Overall, we found that a too low sampling frequency could be a limiting factor when studying interactions and responses to changing conditions in aquatic systems, particularly when biological variables are involved.

Aquatic invertebrate community structure of selected endorheic wetlands (pans) in South Africa	INLAND WATERS												Shallow wetlands, such as pans, are not well studied in South Africa, even though they perform many important functions, such as providing an important food source for migratory birds and habitat to highly specialized fauna. Aquatic invertebrate diversity, abundance, and water quality in pans were analysed seasonally from 3 provinces in South Africa with contrasting climates. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used to assess similarities in aquatic invertebrate communities and water chemistry among pans. Pans inundated for extended periods had greater aquatic invertebrate diversity, and several of these taxa were not adapted to the temporary environment common to pans. The subtropical region had greater aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity than semiarid regions due to more rainfall per annum in the subtropical region. Water temperature was a major driving factor for diversity, with greater diversity occurring in warmer seasons. High water hardness and salinity were found to drive decreased diversity and encourage the presence of hardy and more tolerant species. Understanding the importance of these aforementioned factors (i.e., pan longevity, temperature, water hardness, and salinity) influencing aquatic invertebrate biodiversity in pans provides a baseline for future studies and impact assessments on these important and understudied systems.					; Malherbe, Wynand/AGT-3222-2022; de Necker, Lizaan/JBR-9734-2023	Janse van Vuren, Johannes Hendrik/0000-0003-1482-9074; Malherbe, Wynand/0000-0003-1852-5641; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	3					303	313		10.5268/IW-6.3.783	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.3.783													WOS:000384067400003

Every month, we randomly sampled 20 infested twigs from different coffee trees on each of three experimental blocks, and dissected them to count different stages of X. compactus per twig. We recorded monthly mean temperature and total rainfall. Seasonal fluctuations in numbers of different life stages of X. compactus inside C. canephora twigs over time were analysed with a general linear model. Ambient temperature and rainfall were used to predict changes in monthly mean counts by means of a multiple linear regression. The population of X. compactus varied significantly across months and its major peak occurred from May to August. This variability was poorly explained by prevailing weather conditions with only the number of dead females correlated negatively with mean monthly temperature. Therefore, it may be suitable to apply management interventions against X. compactus on C. canephora in Uganda prior to May-August of each year to prevent the pest from attaining damaging levels. Further research is necessary to better understand the effect of weather variables on population dynamics of this insect pest.

Trophic ecology and persistence of invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in an oligotrophic South African impoundment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The alien invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix established a self-sustaining feral population in an oligotrophic impoundment, Flag Boshielo Dam, in South Africa. The ability of this population to persist in a dam with low algal biomass (median annual suspended chlorophyll a = 0.08 mu g l(-1)), and limited access to rivers considered large enough for successful spawning, has implications for their invasive potential in other systems. Stomach content and stable isotope analysis were used to assess the trophic ecology of H. molitrix, which was then compared with indigenous Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, on a seasonal basis during 2011. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix are generalist filter feeders, with a diet consisting primarily of sediment, vegetative detritus, dinoflagellates and diatoms. The dominance of sediments in their stomachs suggests occasional benthic scavenging. However, H. molitrix occupied a higher trophic level (TL = 2.8) than expected, suggesting that this population subsidised their diet with an unidentified dietary constituent, characterised by enriched nitrogen values. Although the stomach contents indicated dietary overlap between H. molitrix and O. mossambicus, stable isotopes revealed fine-scale resource partitioning, despite both species occupying the same trophic level. Nonetheless, the persistence of this feral H. molitrix population in an oligotrophic impoundment highlights their phenotypic plasticity.

However, little is known about the composition and spatio-temporal patterns of benthic assemblages across this region. Herein, we examined how the community structure and community-environment relationships of macroinvertebrates varied over three consecutive years (2012-2014) across its three distinct water types of the saline main-body (MB) and sub-lakes (SSLs) and the freshwater bodies (FWBs). These waters harbored a poor benthic fauna, with identification of 30 taxa (6 in MB, 6 in SSLs and 23 in FWBs). There were distinct differences of assemblage composition among three water bodies, whereas weak (inter-year) or insignificant (seasons) differences at temporal scales. The CCA models indicated that there were highly naturally-driven environmental-assemblage relationships through time, with constant environmental factors of salinity, water depth and nutrients being the key environmental factors affecting macroinvertebrate variations. The currently overall benthic community composition and structure remains quite stable through years, indicating their suffering less from human activities. These results provide implications for projecting comprehensive benthic biomonitoring and conservation planning for those fragile and under -investigated lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

A new model parameterization was created that enables to reconstruct the spectra of a(ph)(*)(lambda) for turbid productive waters with the higher reliability than previous parameterizations for ocean and coastal waters. The coefficients A(lambda) and B(lambda) of our model differ from those found in seas, coastal waters and other types of lakes. For any water type separately the increase of total chlorophyll concentration accompanied with the decrease of a(ph)(*). Our results showed significant seasonal differences between the model parameters due to diversity of the phytoplankton assemblages. This suggests that season-specific models should be developed and validated. Improving the modelling of chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption spectra for hypertrophic lakes is still pending on the availability of a larger dataset, which includes simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll concentrations, phytoplankton absorption coefficients and phytoplankton species composition. Our results implied that total chlorophyll concentration is not a universal predictor of the magnitude of chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient. The a(ph)(lambda) models are also likely site and season dependent. Further research is needed for quantifying the role of accessory pigments and other optical constituents as well as the cell size of dominant algal species for considering their influence on the modelling outputs.

Effect of phosphorus addition on biofiltration pre-treatment to reduce ultrafiltration membrane fouling	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												A pilot-scale study investigated the effect of phosphorus addition on a drinking water biofilter used to reduce fouling of an ultrafiltration membrane. Biofiltration without pre-treatment (BFwp) has been shown to be an effective pre-treatment for the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) components that cause membrane fouling. However, the river source used in this study was found to have low phosphorus concentrations that could potentially affect biofilter biomass levels and NOM biodegradation. The river water source (Saugeen River located at Walkerton, Ontario, Canada) had a high total organic carbon (4.34-6.61mg/L) of primarily humic content, variable turbidity, and seasonal changes in water temperature (9.7-19.9 degrees C) as measured over the study period. Phosphorus was added to the biofilter influent at 0.01mg P/L, and later at 0.05mg P/L, over a four-month period. Biofilter activity, NOM removal, and membrane performance were compared to a control system operating under identical conditions but without nutrient addition. Filter biomass measured by ATP and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (overall enzyme activity) was stable over time, with no difference between control and phosphorus-amended biofilters. As well, phosphorus addition did not improve the removal of NOM fractions, especially biopolymers that are important for membrane fouling. There was a small initial increase in the removal of dissolved organic carbon and humic substances after phosphorus addition, but this effect diminished over time. The effluent from each biofilter was used to operate an ultrafiltration membrane system using conditions similar to full scale. Membrane fouling for each experiment was measured over 1.5d, and operating cycles included 30-min permeation followed by backwashing/air sparging. Results showed that there was no difference in hydraulically reversible or irreversible fouling of membranes fed with the effluent from control or phosphorus-amended biofilters. It was found that biofilter nutrient feed requirements are likely site specific, and affected by factors including biomass and NOM characteristics.

Applying the tools of time series analysis, the principal processes affecting the lake level are identified and quantified. Lake-level changes reflecting variations in lake volume are dominated by a seasonal cycle of 1.2 m in amplitude. Lake-volume changes occur in addition with a daily period in response to melt water influx from surrounding glaciers. Sporadic lake-volume jumps are caused by bursting of the ice dam of Perito Moreno glacier. Water movements in Lago Argentino are dominated by surface seiches reaching 20 cm in amplitude. Lake tides reach a maximum amplitude of 3 mm. The comparison of the tidal signal extracted from the lake-level observations with a model composed of the contributions of body tide and ocean tidal loading indicates a phase shift of 23 degrees which is most likely explained by an 1 hour phase lag of global ocean tide models in the region of the highly fragmented Pacific coast. The comparison of the obtained results with those of a previous study of Lago Fagnano, Tierra del Fuego, allows to relate differences in the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes between both lakes to morphological properties. This leads to a tentative prediction of the lake-level variability to be expected from other great Patagonian lakes. The presented geodetic results shall serve as a starting point for a detailed limnological investigation of these aquatic ecosystems.					; Mendoza, Luciano/AAI-9616-2020; Horwath, Martin/ABH-4320-2020; Richter, Andreas/ABD-6833-2020; Marderwald, Eric/ABD-7188-2020	Scheinert, Mirko/0000-0002-0892-8941; Marderwald, Eric/0000-0002-2376-8093; Richter, Andreas/0000-0002-8588-9755; Mendoza, Luciano Pedro Oscar/0000-0002-7577-2799; Hormaechea, Jose Luis/0000-0003-4533-3282; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75	1					62	77		10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1189	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1189													WOS:000373393700007

In Australia, the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a significant predator of freshwater turtle nests, destroying up to 93% of nests. We used a nonrandomized intervention study to assess the effectiveness of a short-term (3-week) but broad-scale baiting operation in reducing the level of nest predation on artificial turtle nests around a complex lake system during a major flooding event in north-western Victoria. Estimates of fox occupancy declined from 0.58 (0.44-0.70 95% CI) to 0.34 (0.21-0.46 95% CI) following fox control. Modelling of nest-survival rates indicated there was no significant change in survival rates. Effective short-term predator control to protect seasonally vulnerable prey is desirable and achievable. Knowledge of underlying predator density, predator-bait encounter and consumption rates, and the optimal duration of short-term control is needed to reduce the risk to prey.																			1442-7001	1442-8903				JAN	2016	17	1					63	69		10.1111/emr.12199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.12199													WOS:000368732700009

Nutrient and light limitation of reservoir phytoplankton in relation to storm-mediated pulses in stream discharge	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We investigated the dynamics of nutrient and light limitation of phytoplankton in a reservoir ecosystem in relation to storm-mediated variation in stream discharge, and how dynamics differed at a shallow site near stream inflows versus one in deep water near the lake outflow. Storm-mediated discharge events reduced the severity of nutrient limitation and increased the severity of light limitation, as predicted by a model of reservoir resource limitation developed by KIMMEL et al. (1990). The severity of nutrient limitation was negatively correlated with discharge to the lake; the correlation was strongest with discharge over the preceding 10-14 day period and weaker at shorter and longer time scales. However, discharge events also flushed phytoplankton from the lake and enhanced light limitation, so it is not clear by which mechanism(s) discharge events mediate phytoplankton resource limitation. Phytoplankton near stream inflows were less nutrient limited than phytoplankton at the lake outflow, consistent with predictions of the KIMMEL et al. (1990) model. However, this was true even when streamflow was negligible, suggesting alternative mechanisms for reduced nutrient limitation near stream inflows. In contrast to predictions of the model, phytoplankton were not more light limited near stream inflows than at the outflow; shallower depth near inflows compensated for higher turbidity, in terms of the light climate experienced by phytoplankton. Our results show that the mechanisms by which discharge events mediate phytoplankton resource limitation are complex and require further study in reservoirs as well as other aquatic systems subject to a high degree of temporal variation in discharge.

The study also aims to identify the seasonal variation in the aquatic insects' composition during the weak La Nina event. A total of 135 water samples and 1678 aquatic insect individuals (four orders and 14 families) were collected during fieldwork campaign that spanned over the inter-monsoonal period, wet and dry seasons between October 2004 and June 2005. OP has the highest abundance of aquatic insects particularly during the dry season. Biological indices showed that all stations were in moderate water category. The water quality index (WQI) was calculated and indicated that the quality of the river categorised into Class II. Discriminant analysis (DA) was employed to classify the independent variables into mutually-exclusive groups. Suspended sediment (SS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were high during the wet season. Suspended sediment was high in oxbow lake and could be a strong reason behind low abundance of aquatic insects.

J	Trudeau, MP; Richardson, M				Trudeau, M. P.; Richardson, Murray			Change in event-scale hydrologic response in two urbanizing watersheds of the Great Lakes St Lawrence Basin 1969-2010	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The cumulative impacts of urban land use change on natural stream flow regimes and lotic ecosystems are poorly understood, and generally under-studied within the hydrologic sciences literature. Moreover, flow assessments using daily or monthly flows cannot adequately characterize long-term trends in event-scale flow dynamics in urbanizing watersheds. Accordingly, we analyzed high temporal resolution (15-min flows) growing season discharge records for two urbanizing watersheds in Canada's Great Lakes Basin, the Don and Humber, over a 42-year period. Results show that total discharge between May 26th and November 15th in the mainstem rivers has increased by about 45%, independent of total rainfall depth, over four decades. Peak rain event flow rates have increased by about 1 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1) in both watersheds and event flow variability has increased two-fold in the Don and five-fold in the Humber. In the Don, the ratio of rising limb event flows to median flow (for the period May 26 to November 15) increased from 13 in the 1970s to 21 in the 2000s. A similar comparison of ratios in the Humber showed higher variation in flow response but also an overall increase relative to the ratio of 14 in the 1970s. In the Don, rising limb event flow acceleration increased 2.4-fold over 4 decades. This study provides a new understanding of the changes in event-scale flow regime dynamics associated with over four decades of intensive urbanization, including increased magnitude of rising limb flows and flow acceleration, and systematic increases in the variability of peak discharges. Overall, our analysis demonstrates marked alteration in total and event flow regimes resulting in chronic perturbation of stream flows. The results also demonstrate an important application of long-term, high temporal resolution hydrological records. Furthermore, we quantify the degree to which hydrologic stationarity within the Don and Humber watersheds has been compromised over four decades, during a period prior to detectable climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns.

Intra-annual dendroclimatic reconstruction for northern British Columbia, Canada, using wood properties	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Key message Analyses of tree-ring wood properties combined with an understanding of tree physiology provided detailed intra-annual insights into historical and seasonal climate phenomena in sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics.

The construction of dams and changes in water flow caused problems for ecosystems. Therefore, when implementing the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) hydro-morphological indicators and targets were developed for rivers and lakes to achieve good ecological potential. The hydrological regime is one such indicator. To understand the change in flow regime we quantified the hydropower impact on river flow across Sweden by using the S-HYPE model and observations. The results show that the average redistribution of water during a year due to regulation is 19% for the total discharge from Sweden. A distinct impact was found in seasonal flow patterns and flow duration curves. Moreover, we quantified the model skills in predicting hydropower impact on flow. The median NSE for simulating change in flow regime was 0.71 for eight dams studied. Results from the spatially distributed model are available for 37 000 sub-basins across the country, and will be used by the Swedish water authorities for reporting hydro-morphological indicators to the EU and for guiding the allocation of river restoration measures.

Photosynthesis in Aquatic Bryophytes	PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN BRYOPHYTES AND EARLY LAND PLANTS	Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration											Aquatic bryophytes occupy streams, lakes, and wetlands where they face limited CO2 in solution, limited CO2 diffusion, high boundary layer resistance, and loss of light with depth, especially red light. Limitations to photosynthesis in the water are therefore somewhat different from those on land. Of primary importance is the availability of CO2 and hence, p H is important in determining the availability of this gas. There is also limited evidence that some mosses might be able to convert bicarbonates to CO2 at the moss surface or within the cell to increase access to carbon. The often one-cell-thick leaves permit light and CO2 to reach photosynthetic cells directly, but boundary-layer resistance can reduce CO2 uptake. Other nutrients can be somewhat limiting, especially phosphorus and nitrogen. Sedimentation, and overgrowth by diatoms, other algae, and detrital complex, can block light, and water decreases the light with depth. This is further complicated by the rapid attenuation of red light. The aquatic environment protects chlorophyll from UV radiation, and in areas with high light intensity, at least some bryophytes produce enhanced pigmentation to serve as a filter. In dry seasons, lack of water can limit or halt photosynthesis. Temperature also can be a problem at this time, with exposed but still hydrated mosses in some cases reaching temperatures unknown in submersed conditions, and causing elevated respiration that can exceed photosynthetic fixation. High temperatures may greatly limit the presence of many cosmopolitan species of aquatic bryophytes in tropical regions. Contrarily, many aquatic mosses have temperature optima in the 0-20 degrees C range, with optima depending on their usual habitats.																			1572-0233		978-94-007-6988-5; 978-94-007-6987-8				2014	37						201	231		10.1007/978-94-007-6988-5_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6988-5_12	10.1007/978-94-007-6988-5												WOS:000332364600013

Fish Assemblages, Connectivity, and Habitat Rehabilitation in a Diked Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Complex	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish and plant assemblages in the highly modified Crane Creek coastal wetland complex of Lake Erie were sampled to characterize their spatial and seasonal patterns and to examine the implications of the hydrologic connection of diked wetland units to Lake Erie. Fyke netting captured 52 species and an abundance of fish in the Lake Erie-connected wetlands, but fewer than half of those species and much lower numbers and total masses of fish were captured in diked wetland units. Although all wetland units were immediately adjacent to Lake Erie, there were also pronounced differences in water quality and wetland vegetation between the hydrologically isolated and lake-connected wetlands. Large seasonal variations in fish assemblage composition and biomass were observed in connected wetland units but not in disconnected units. Reestablishment of hydrologic connectivity in diked wetland units would allow coastal Lake Erie fish to use these vegetated habitats seasonally, although connectivity does appear to pose some risks, such as the expansion of invasive plants and localized reductions in water quality. Periodic isolation and drawdown of the diked units could still be used to mimic intermediate levels of disturbance and manage invasive wetland vegetation.					; Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012	Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; 													0002-8487	1548-8659					2014	143	5					1130	1142		10.1080/00028487.2014.911207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.911207													WOS:000340887300002

Topical advances and recent studies in paleolimnological research	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Paleolimnology combines the disciplines of limnology, geology and ecology, but because of challenges that separate investigators from direct knowledge about past lake conditions, the field is multidisciplinary by necessity. As a result, paleolimnology is influenced continuously by advances in many disciplines. As with limnological studies in recent decades, paleolimnology has diverged largely from the ecological and theoretical focuses of early investigators, but recent studies demonstrate the need for more integration of ecological and paleolimnological research. This paper provides a brief overview of recent paleolimnological investigations that have addressed questions related to theoretical ecology, as well as applied lake-management and climate research issues. We examine the use of transfer function models for estimating past water-quality conditions, and important caveats expressed by investigators about limitations in the development and use of such models. Paleolimnological research has contributed new insights about biological, physical and chemical processes in lakes that have been subject to change because of climate drivers and anthropogenic influences. These findings are relevant to predicting how lakes will respond to climate change, and will require new management approaches in the future. As the range of paleolimnological studies expands, there will be greater need for basic limnological research in order for paleolimnological investigators to better understand how sediments reflect lake processes of those regions.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73			1			149	160		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.827	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.827													WOS:000338929200012

Preliminary observations suggest that activation of crumpled and unstable phyllite dominated slopes led to temporary damming of second and third order tributaries of the Alaknanda river. Sedimentary styles of the succession indicate deposition under the transient lacustrine environment, with seasonality. Luminescence chronology suggests that the lakes were formed after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and probably continued till the Mid-Holocene. Lake formation is attributed to the reactivation of phyllite-dominated slopes following the reestablishment of the southwest monsoon after the LGM. Presence of contorted laminas is interpreted as episodic events of seismic activity. Finally the lakes disappeared due to large-scale slope reactivation around Mid-Holocene.					; Tripathi, Jayant/NHQ-5581-2025; Srivastava, Pradeep/AAC-3039-2020	Srivastava, Pradeep/0000-0002-9591-7764; 													0011-3891					AUG 25	2007	93	4					568	574																WOS:000249227100034

How individual, social, and ecological conditions influence dispersal decisions in male vervet monkeys	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Dispersal between social groups reduces the risk of inbreeding and can improve individuals' reproductive opportunities. However, this movement has costs, such as increased risk of predation and starvation, loss of allies and kin support, and increased aggression associated with entering the new group. Dispersal strategies, such as the timing of movement and decisions on whether to transfer alone or in parallel with a peer, involve different costs and benefits. We used demographic, behavioral, hormonal, and ecological data to examine the causes and consequences of 36 dispersal events from 29 male vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. Adult males' secondary dispersal coincided with the conception season in females, and males improved their potential access to females by moving to groups with higher female-to-male sex ratios and/or by increasing their dominance rank. Males that dispersed with a peer had lower fecal glucocorticoid and androgen metabolite levels than lone dispersers. Subadult males were not more likely to engage in parallel dispersals compared to adult males. Dispersal was also used as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding, but changes in hormone levels did not seem to be a trigger of dispersal in our population. Our findings illustrate the complex individual strategies used during dispersal, how many factors can influence movement decisions, as well as the value of dominance and hormone analyses for understanding these strategies.					; Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019	Schwegel, Megan/0000-0002-5502-6350; L'Allier, Simon/0000-0003-0163-901X													0275-2565	1098-2345				SEP	2022	84	9							e23426	10.1002/ajp.23426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23426		AUG 2022						35942562					WOS:000837473000001

Long-term monitoring results, from December 2000 to July 2003, indicated that 2-MIB was present in the reservoir at concentrations between 10 and 200 ng L(-1), and those of geosmin were always smaller than 10 ng L(-1). The 2-MIB concentrations followed a trend of higher concentrations during the warm seasons. After being analyzed with 10 water quality and three meteorological parameters, 2-MIB concentration was found to correlate with corresponding air and water temperatures. An analysis of air temperature history versus 2-MIB concentration in FSR suggested that 2-MIB concentration was best correlated with the mean of average daily temperature from 1 to 9 days before sampling, with R(2)=0.90. This correlation was further employed to predict the 2-MIB concentration observed during another sampling period in FSR. A similar degree of fit was observed between predictions and experimental data, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach. In addition to the effect of temperature, heavy rainfalls that occurred before the sampling time may also reduce the 2-MIB concentration in the reservoir. A short-term continuous monitoring of the odorants for 32 h showed that both geosmin and 2-MIB concentrations in the reservoir remained almost constant, with only about a 10% difference during the sampling period. This may suggest that the odorants were uniformly distributed in the water near the sampling location in the reservoir.

Relationships among nitrogen and total phosphorus, algal biomass and zooplankton density in the central Amazonia lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationship among concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), algal biomass (Chl) and the density and size of individuals of the zooplankton community were studied for the dry season (November 1999-January 2000) at 20 lakes of the Central Amazonia. The study was conducted along a productivity gradient to identify the existence of resource or predator-dependent patterns on the primary producers of the trophic web. A strong positive relationship was observed between the log Chl and TN (r(2) = 0.88, P = 0.000) and to log Chl and log TP (r(2) = 0.85, P = 0.000) in a simple linear regression. However, when both variables were running together in a multiple regression, TN alone explained every variation of algal biomass (r(2) = 0.89, P (TN) = 0.022, P (TP) = 0.233). The total density of the zooplankton showed a positive correlation with log Chl (r(2) = 0.53, P = 0.000) and the large zooplankton (> 0.5 mm) was found to be a more positive function of the phytoplankton (r(2) = 0.65) than the density of the small ones (< 0.5 mm, r(2) = 0.44). Results show that complex food web interactions could be responsible for patterns in tropical systems. We contend that Chl variation in tropical lake systems is controlled by TN and TP, but the predictor power of the TN increase the fit of the model in analysis and can be use alone to access the variability in algae biomass to Amazonian tropical lakes. We also agree that the density of large zooplankton individuals is regulated by the biomass of primary producers. Hence we concluded that the resource-dependent hypothesis is supported in these systems.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Trevisan, Giselle/R-9654-2018	forsberg, bruce/0000-0001-7606-0585; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2007	586						357	365		10.1007/s10750-007-0705-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0705-7													WOS:000246612800029

In this study, we tested the non-parametric Seasonal Kendall (SEAKEN) trend model and the parametric USGS Quality of Water trend program (QWTREND) to quantify trends in water quality of the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling from 1976 to 2003. Both methods indicated decreasing trends in flow-adjusted concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphorus (OP) and a generally increasing trend in flow-adjusted nitrate Plus nitrite-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration. The SEAKEN results were strongly influenced by the length of the record as well as extreme years (dry or wet) earlier in the record. The QWTREND results, though influenced somewhat by the same factors, were more stable. The magnitudes of trends between the two methods were somewhat different and appeared to be associated with conceptual differences between the flow-adjustment processes used and with data processing methods. The decreasing trends in TSS, TP, and OP concentrations are likely related to conservation measures implemented ill the basin. However, dilution effects from wet climate or additional tile drainage cannot be ruled out. The increasing trend in NO3-N concentrations was likely due to increased drainage in the basin. Since the Minnesota River is the main source of sediments to the Mississippi River, this study also addressed the rapid filling of Lake Pepin on the Mississippi River and found the likely cause to be increased flow due to recent wet climate in the region.

Characterization of surface and ground water δ18O seasonal variation and its use for estimating groundwater residence times	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												O-18 is an ideal tracer for characterizing hydrological processes because it can be reliably measured in several watershed hydrological compartments. Here, we present multiyear isotopic data, i.e. O-18 variations (delta O-18), for precipitation inputs, surface water and groundwater in the Shingobee River Headwaters Area (SRHA), a well-instrumented research catchment in north-central Minnesota. SRHA surface waters exhibit delta O-18 seasonal variations similar to those of groundwaters, and seasonal O-18 variations plotted versus time fit seasonal sine functions. These seasonal delta O-18 variations were interpreted to estimate surface water and groundwater mean residence times (MRTs) at sampling locations near topographically closed-basin lakes. MRT variations of about 1 to 16 years have been estimated over an area covering about 9 km(2) from the basin boundary to the most downgradient well. Estimated MRT error ( +/- 0.3 to +/- 0.7 years) is small for short MRTs and is much larger ( +/- 10 years) for a well with an MRT (16 years) near the limit of the method. Groundwater transit time estimates based on Darcy's law, tritium content, and the seasonal delta O-18 amplitude approach appear to be consistent within the limits of each method. The results from this study suggest that use of the delta O-18 seasonal variation method to determine MRTs can help assess groundwater recharge areas in small headwaters catchments.

J	Clarke, SJ				Clarke, SJ			Vegetation growth in rivers: influences upon sediment and nutrient dynamics	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Hydrological and geomorphological research in river environments has largely ignored the influence of instream vegetation growth; focusing rather on the role of riparian vegetation as a control on bank stability or as a potential buffer for dissolved and particulate material entering the channel from the hillslope. However, in many lowland streams instream vegetation may be abundant and reach high levels of biomass during the growing season. These instream plants (macrophytes) have a significant effect on flow, sediment and nutrient dynamics. Plant growth may cause increased frictional resistance to flow and through flow diversion may have a short- to medium-term influence on instream channel geomorphology. Additionally, this effect of plants upon flow velocities within the channel has an impact on sedimentation patterns. Rooted plants also function as a link between bed sediments and the water column, thus plants have a key role in the cycling of nutrients between these two components of the fluvial system. This, combined with the uptake and temporary storage of nutrients by the plants and the retention of fine sediments within dense plant stands, has the result that plants within rivers are an integral component of nutrient dynamics. A review of research on the role of macrophytes in fluvial system nutrient dynamics is presented and identifies the need for an increased understanding and recognition of the role of plants in the functioning of fluvial systems as a whole.																			0309-1333					JUN	2002	26	2					159	172		10.1191/0309133302pp324ra	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0309133302pp324ra													WOS:000176015700001

Physicochemical Assessment of Surface and Groundwater Quality of the Greater Chittagong Region of Bangladesh	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL & ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The study was carried out to assess surface and groundwater quality of the greater Chittagong (Chittagong and Cox's Bazar districts) and Chittagong Hill Tracts (Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban districts) of Bangladesh. To study the various physicochemical and microbiological parameters, surface water samples from the Karnafuli, Halda, Sangu, Matamuhuri, Bakkhali, Naf, Kasalong, Chingri and Mayani Rivers, Kaptai Lake and groundwater samples from almost every Upazilas, smaller administrative unit of Bangladesh, were collected and analyzed. The statistical methods of sampling were used for collecting samples. Samples were preserved using suitable preservation methods. Water samples from the freshwater resources were collected from different points and tide conditions and at different seasons for continuous monitoring during the hydrological years 2008-2009. The collected samples were analyzed for the following parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), total solids (TS), dissolved oxygen (DO), transparency, acidity, dissolved carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, total hardness, chloride, ammonia-N, hydrogen sulfide, sulphate-S, o-phosphate-P, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate-N, nitrite-N, total nitrite and nitrate-N, arsenic, iron, manganese, copper, nickel, chromium, cadmium, lead, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium using the procedure outlined in the standard methods. Average values of maximum physicochemical and microbiological parameters studied for the Karnafuli River were found higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The maximum water quality parameters of Kaptai Lake and other Rivers of Chittagong region were existed within the permissible limits of WHO guideline. The data showed the water quality slightly differs in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon than monsoon season. The concentration of different constituents of most of the groundwater samples were within the permissible limits of BSTI drinking water quality guideline except As, Fe, and Mn. Results of water quality assessment identified the problem areas in respect of arsenic. The results also provided data to understand and quantify the threat of the impact of climate change on freshwater resources of this region. The results also provided data for water quality of surface and groundwater resources of Chittagong region to match national and international standards for drinking, agricultural, industrial and livestock requirements.

Testate Amoebae of a Monsoon Tropical Forest of South Vietnam	ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA												The composition (143 species and forms) of testate amoebae communities from 68 samples of soils and lake sediments from South Vietnam (Cat Tien National Park) was investigated. In most terrestrial habitats, hydrophilous, soil and even xerophilous testaceans were co-occurring. The likely reason for this phenomenon are sharp seasonal changes in hydrological regime including temporal over-wetting or inundation. Typical members of soil communities were Plagiopyxis callida, Tracheleuglypha acolla, Euglypha cristata, E. tuber-culata, Trinema complanatum. The fauna was composed mainly of eurybiont species. Less abundant but still common were moss-dwelling species from the genera Heleopera, Hyalosphenia, Nebela and Sphenoderia. Calciphilous species were also present, including Centropyxis plagiostoma, Geopyxella cf. sylvicola, Schwabia terricola, Plagiopyxis callida, P. intermedia v. cyrtostoma, Heleopera petricola v. humicola. Species from the genera Hoogenraadia, Planhoogenraadia, Apolimia were found in this region of South-East Asia for the first time. The variations in the species composition and diversity of testate amoebae in soils was likely caused by several mechanisms including local variations in hydrological regime, the differences in chemical and physical properties and decomposition rates of plant litter, and mineralogical features of soils. The fauna of lake sediments was very distinct with characteristic species Difflugia bacillariarum, Lesquereusia modesta, Arcella gibbosa, Euglypha acanthophora. In the relatively uniform lake sediments local microcommunities were rich in species but very similar in species composition (low beta-diversity). In contrast, in soil samples the micro-scale heterogeneity was usually very pronounced, though the alpha-diversity was lower than in lake sediments. The updated list of testate amoebae of Vietnam includes 237 taxa. Taxa with restricted geographical distribution form up to one tenth of the total species richness.

Both the oxygen and the carbon isotopes display an overall trend of enrichment together with decreasing growth rates over the time period covered by the stalagmite, which is considered a generally cooling period according to current palaeoclimate understanding. The stable isotope records show enriched isotopic values during the, for Scandinavia, comparatively cold period AD 1300-1700 and depleted values during the warmer period AD 800-1000. The indication of a negative relationship between measured delta 18O and surface temperature concurs with earlier reported stalagmite records from regions with a seasonal snow cover and is further supported by the fact that the stalagmite delta 18O record shows general similarities with both regional and hemispheric temperature reconstructions available for the past 500 and 2000 years, respectively. Compared with a stable isotope record of lacustrine carbonates from northern Sweden, however, shifting correlations over time between the two records indicate that a local hydrological change may have taken place at Korallgrottan, or at the lake, compared with around 1000 years ago. The earlier part of the stalagmite delta 18O might thus be influenced, to some extent, by another process than the later part, which means that a negative relationship between delta 18O and surface temperature might not hold for the entire 4000-year-old record.

Two periods were analyzed: 2012 (low water level, LWL) and 2013 (high water level, HWL) in the littoral zone of two shallow waterbodies (Sutla backwater, NW Croatia). Waterbody S1, covered with Ceratophyllum demersum, was sampled in the macrophyte stands, and the littoral benthal area, while waterbody S2, without macrophytes, was sampled only in the littoral benthal area. It was observed discovered that among the macrophyte stands in S1, gastropods were significantly more abundant during LWL. The same trend was observed in the littoral benthal area of S2. In contrast, gastropod abundance was higher in the littoral benthal area of S1 during HWL. Comparing gastropods in the two waterbodies, the abundance in S1 was ten times higher than in S2. The most abundant species was Gyraulus parvus, which accounted for 51-92% of the gastropods observed among the macrophytes of S1 and 86% in the adjacent benthic zone. Among the FFG groups, grazers (particularly those feeding on gymnamoebae and rotifers) had the largest proportion, followed by shredders feeding on small pieces of macrophytes. In our research, we indicate the important role of microhabitat diversity and submerged macrophytes as a rich food source for gastropods and safe shelter from predators.

Chironomid assemblages from seabird-affected High Arctic ponds	POLAR BIOLOGY												Seabirds can shunt nutrients and contaminants from marine to terrestrial ecosystems by forming dense breeding colonies and releasing wastes to these sites. A large colony of seabirds at Cape Vera (Devon Island, High Arctic Canada) has resulted in eutrophic conditions and potentially toxic concentrations of sedimentary metals in several freshwater ponds that drain their nesting sites. Here, we investigated the effects of elevated nutrient and sedimentary metal concentrations on the distribution of subfossil chironomids in surface sediments from 21 ponds that span a gradient of seabird influence. Although many ponds registered high nutrient concentrations (e.g., mean TP = 45 mu g l (-1)), eutrophic taxa typical of temperate waters were not common, with most assemblages being dominated by morphotypes of Psectrocladius and Tanytarsina, as well as Corynoneura arctica-type, and Metriocnemus hygropetricus-type. Although the ponds within and outside the area influenced by seabirds contained largely similar taxa, variations did exist in the relative abundances of the different species. Lakewater pH was the only measured environmental variable that explained statistically significant amounts of variation in the chironomid assemblages. Although direct effects of pH on chironomids cannot be ruled out, pH is likely tracking production-related changes driven by limnetic dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics. Sediment cores collected from seabird-affected and seabird-free ponds showed a greater number of chironomid taxa and higher head capsule abundances in the pond receiving seabird inputs. Chironomid assemblages in both cores recorded increased abundances in recent decades, likely in response to warmer conditions and lengthened growing seasons.

Protracted spawning of St Lawrence River northern pike (Esox lucius): simulated effects on survival, growth, and production	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				An individual-based early life history model demonstrated that the timing and distribution of St Lawrence River northern pike (Esox lucius) spawning could affect subsequent young-of-year (YOY) production during nursery and influence year-class formation. Three different spawning patterns have emerged from empirical studies, where egg deposition occurred along the entire littoral gradient beginning in seasonally flooded emergent habitats in tributaries, progressing to submerged aquatic vegetation in shallow bays, and ending in deep water littoral habitats (up to 6 m). The spawning period is protracted, and typically lasts 6-8 weeks due to the presence of a strong thermal gradient. The model used temperature as the driving variable to predict egg abundance, stage-specific development, growth, survival, and ultimately relative production of YOY northern pike within 1-ha plots representative of the three habitats. Earlier spawning (mean 21 days) and higher mean daily survival and growth yielded higher YOY net production for tributaries (mean = 3095.4 g ha(-1), SD = 2028.6) relative to the shallow bay habitat (202.5 g ha(-1), SD = 125.7). In contrast, deep littoral habitat represented an ecological sink with little production (< 0.9 g ha(-1)). The results demonstrate the importance of the linkage between spawning and nursery processes in determining reproductive success.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUN	2006	15	2					169	179		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00135.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00135.x													WOS:000238542100011
J	Vincens, A; Tiercelin, JJ; Buchet, G				Vincens, Annie; Tiercelin, Jean-Jacques; Buchet, Guillaume			New Oligocene-early Miocene microflora from the southwestern Turkana Basin palaeoenvironmental implications in the northern Kenya rift	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We report five Oligocene-early Miocene pollen assemblages from the Loperot-1 exploration well drilled in the semi-desert Lokichar Basin (latitude 02 degrees 21' 46.15"N, longitude 35 degrees 52'23.47" E, ground elevation 615 m above MSL), near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya. They represent the second oldest plant microfossils so far recovered from East Africa and add significantly to the Paleogene-Neogene tropical African fossil plant record. The Loperot pollen indicate a mosaic environment of semi-deciduous forest and humid woodland whose floristic composition presents strong affinities with the vegetation occurring today in the Guinea-Congolia/Zambezia phytogeographical transition zone, with a rainfall more than 1000 mm/year and a well defined dry season. The weak representation of Poaceae and herbaceous taxa characteristic of grassland, dry bushland or savanna and the abundance of shade tolerant plants such as ferns all point to a vegetation composed to a variety of communities with closed forest formations predominant. The lack of typical temperate mountains elements, mainly Podocarpus and Juniperus today widespread on the East African highlands, indicates that the geography of the region was different from that of today. The plateaux or uplands adjacent to the Lokichar basin were probably still not high enough during this period of early rifting in East Africa to support the temperate coniferous forests characteristic of the Plio-Pleistocene.

This core is located below the pathway of the Indonesian Throughflow, at a depth of 1805 m bsl. Planktonic foraminifera assemblages, the delta O-18 and delta C-13 of the foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber, and the total carbonate content of each sample were used to reconstruct the vertical structure of the water column through the past similar to 80,000 yr. Today, the core site is characterised by high sea-surface temperature and high precipitation, which results in the formation of a low-salinity boundary layer. Sea-surface temperature estimates down core indicate minimal cooling during the last glacial maximum. Mean sea-surface temperatures ranged between 29.8 degrees C and 26.6 degrees C for the past similar to 80,000 yr; sea-surface seasonality never increased above 3 degrees C. In addition, the abundance of the planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, and Globigerinoides quadrilobatus indicates that the mixed layer (the low-salinity boundary layer of the Throughflow) thinned during Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 2. This enhanced a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. The Northwest Monsoon was less intense for about 60,000 yr and then 'switched on' at similar to 15,000 cal yr BP. This thickened the mixed layer, reducing the DCM, and increased SST seasonality in the Banda Sea. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At present, when forest fires begin, it is often quite complicated to provide sufficient technical support for the quick prevention and elimination of fires. This fact is largely eliminated by the designed fire-fighting adapter. The mentioned fire-fighting adapter can be used as a fire-fighting mobile device with a base machine of a forest wheeled skidder (LKT), part of the long-distance transport of water in difficult terrain (lake system), a water tank in difficult terrain with the possibility of filling the Bambi bag with a helicopter, part of the long-distance transport of water in the case of a difficult water source without a forest access road network, and a mobile device for emergency transportation of materials in difficult terrain. In addition to the use for fighting forest fires, the fire adapter can also be used to provide for transport of water for forest nurseries (irrigation), freshly planted areas in the event of prolonged drought, the filling of watering-places for forest animals and filling puddles in the dry season. When designing the supporting frame, we used and imitated the evolutionary approach of nature in the form of generative design. The presented paper deals with the use of modern composite materials in the design of superstructures for base machines, which gradually acquire meaning. The main reason for the increasing use of fiberglass is to achieve higher strength and safer weight reduction. This adapter is designed for forest wheel tractors that reach 40% slope availability, are able to work on the stand area, overcome obstacles and are available in sufficient quantities in all Slovak forest areas.

Nesting of Morelet's crocodile, Crocodylus moreletii (Dumeril and Bibron), in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												We evaluated the nesting by Crocodylus moreletii in Lago de Catemaco, Veracruz, southeastern, Mexico. During the nesting and hatching seasons, we searched for nests along the northern margins of the lake and small associated streams. We investigated egg mortality by weekly monitoring each of the nests found, recording sign of predation (tracks and holes dug into the nest) and the effect of water level fluctuations. We not found differences to nest between inland or flooded zones. However, we found that egg size varied among nests. In nests built inland, predation was the major cause of egg mortality whereas flooding resulted in more deaths of eggs in the flooding zone. Flooding killed 25% of eggs monitored in this study. We suggest that to increase nest success in the Morelet's crocodile it is necessary to promote conservation of nesting areas around the lake, recently occupied by urban or tourist developments.					; Reynoso, Victor/AHA-8204-2022; Villegas, Alejandro/JWO-5061-2024	Villegas, Alejandro/0000-0003-0319-0463; Arcos Garcia, Jose Luis/0000-0002-6058-0487													1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2017	77	4					724	730		10.1590/1519-6984.19015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.19015								28355391					WOS:000414017100008
J	Sibbing, FA; Nagelkerke, LAJ				Sibbing, FA; Nagelkerke, LAJ			Resource partitioning by Lake Tana barbs predicted from fish morphometrics and prey characteristics	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												We develop a food-fish model (FFM), which quantitatively relates properties of aquatic food types (size, shape, escape velocity, habitat, mechanical properties and chemical quality) to feeding structures of cyprinid fish. The model is based on functional morphology and experiments on search, capture, selection, and internal processing of food by fish. The FFM shows which food properties are most critical in feeding and how fish can optimise coping with them. Relative food size imposes the highest demands, followed by prey velocity, food habitat and mechanical properties. These overrule taxonomic affinities of food types. Highly demanding food types (large, fast prey, suspensions of plankton, benthic prey and mechanically tough items) impose incompatible morphological requirements on fish. We apply the FFM to the endemic Barbus species flock of Lake Tana (Ethiopia), since the structural diversity of its 14 species reflects recent adaptations to trophic niches. We predict their potentials in utilising different food types by quantitative comparisons of 35 parameters, measured for each species, with the values for each food specialist derived from the FFM. These diet predictions are tested against gut contents from 4,711 fish, sampled over seasons and habitats. Gut contents and predictions show a good overall fit. The value of the model is shown by its resolution in predicting resource partitioning among the barbs. For the 14 barbs a trophic hierarchy with six major trophic groups is reconstructed which closely matches the predictions. Trophic specialists (> 65% by volume of a single food type) are also structurally specialised, whereas less extreme anatomical structures characterise trophic generalists, allowing them to switch between feeding modes. Trophic generalists are best defined by behavioral flexibility, since feeding modes integrate both fish and food characters. The FFM is of practical use in evaluating the role of morphological diversity in an ecosystem and enables the analysis of trophic interactions in fish communities and of the cascading effects by environmental change. Such an approach can be instrumental in the development of management strategies for fisheries and in conservation of biodiversity.

J	Schauer, M; Hahn, MW				Schauer, M; Hahn, MW			Diversity and phylogenetic affiliations of morphologically conspicuous large filamentous bacteria occurring in the pelagic zones of a broad spectrum of freshwater habitats	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Filamentous bacteria with a conspicuous morphology were found in the majority of the bacterioplankton samples from a variety of freshwater habitats that were studied. These heterotrophic filaments typically account for < 1 to 11% of the total number of bacteria. The biovolume of this morphotype can exceed 40% of the biovolume for all bacteria. Surprisingly, we found hardly any data on these morphologically conspicuous filaments in the literature. Mixed cultures containing these filamentous bacteria were established by cultivation and isolation experiments with samples from different freshwater lakes. Nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from several mixed cultures and environmental samples from habitats in Europe, Africa, China, Australia, and New Zealand. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed that three groups form a single monophyletic cluster, the SOL cluster, in the family Saprospiraceae. We developed a set of six nested probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization. Of the six probes, one probe was specific for Haliscomenobacter hydrossis, three probes were specific for the three subclusters (each probe was specific for one subcluster), one probe was specific for the entire SOL cluster, and another probe targeted almost the entire Saprospiraceae family. Specific hybridization of environmental samples and enrichments showed that the members of the three subclusters exhibited the same filamentous morphology. So far, using the subcluster-specific probes, we have not been able to detect any bacteria with a differing morphology. We conclude that the SOL cluster bacteria are an integral part of bacterioplankton in many freshwater habitats. They potentially account for a large fraction of the total bacterial, biomass but have been underrepresented in molecular diversity studies so far.

This study presents an experimental and numerical investigation on MPs pollution from combined sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharging into two alpine lakes in northern Italy. Spatial and temporal trends of MPs concentrations and loads are investigated in the sewerage under dry-weather conditions and during representative rainfall events in the period September 2022-January 2023. The study allows the identification of key factors which contribute to higher MPs emissions. The acquired waste- and storm-water samples (2 L each) were dried and subjected to chemical oxidation with H2O2 before optical microscopy and infrared spectroscopy analysis. Dry-weather sewerage MPs concentration exhibits an average of 17.6 mg/L and standard deviation of 2.1 mg/ L in dry-weather, with slightly higher values for the system with the lower per capita water supply. The daily mass of MPs directed to the treatment in the tourist season (i.e., September) is slightly above 50 % of the average daily mass characterizing the subsequent non-tourist months. Wet-weather MPs concentration is relatively lower (average of 12.9 mg/L, standard deviation of 2.0 mg/L), these values depending on the relative importance of the stormwater flow from the directly drained catchment compared to the flow contribution coming from the upstream pumping stations. The outcomes have implications for assessing spatial-temporal exposure of aquatic ecosystems to MPs pollution in urban areas, providing indications on effective management practices and control measures of urban drainage systems against environmental contamination.

They are the subject of our present study, using hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes. Two water sampling campaigns in dry and wet seasons for studying physicochemical and natural isotope analysis provided 44 groundwater samples and watertable level measurements from monitoring wells and eight water samples from river, creek, and lake. In the dry season, lake and creek waters presented TDS (<3.64 mg L-1) and high values of TDS in groundwater and river (average 47.71 and 108.7 mg L-1, respectively), showing CaMgHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaHCO3Cl types and precipitation prevalence. However, GW-SW interaction occurred in CaMgCl and CaMgSO4 groundwater with TDS varying from 93.8 to 164.7 mg L-1 and weathering dominance close to riverbanks. The TDS, sulfate, and sodium were monitoring markers of this interaction. In the wet season, superficial waters and groundwater were more diluted, presenting CaMgHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaHCO3Cl types and precipitation dominance. Overall, the ion exchange was the main hydrochemical process. The delta O-18, delta H-2, and d-excess indicated groundwater recharge with a weak evaporation process, rainwater mixture, and water-rock interaction. Maps of the distribution of ions, isotopes, and d-excess showed GW-SW interaction along the riverbanks and depleted groundwater in a large portion of the alluvial plain. The alluvial plains are susceptible areas to precipitation changes due to fast and direct infiltration. Their monitoring can be essential to understand the climate variability and reduce impacts on the shallow aquifer that sustain forests and human life.

One of the fundamental insights of behavioural ecology is that resources influence breeding systems. For instance, when food resources are plenty, one parent is able to care for the young on its own, so that the other parent can desert and became polygamous. We investigated this hypothesis in the context of classical polyandry when females may have several mates within a single breeding season, and parental duties are carried out largely by the male. 2. We studied a precocial wader, the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus, that exhibits variable brood care such that the chicks may be raised by both parents, only by the female or, more often, only by the male. The timing of female desertion varies: some females desert their brood at hatching of the eggs and lay a clutch for a new mate, whereas other females stay with their brood until the chicks fledge. Kentish plovers are excellent organisms with which to study breeding system evolution, as some of their close relatives exhibit classical polyandry (Eurasian dotterel Eudromias morinellus, mountain plover Charadrius montanus), whereas others are polygynous (northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus). 3. Kentish plovers raised their broods in two habitats in our study site in southern Turkey: saltmarsh and lakeshore. Food intake was higher on the lakeshore than in the saltmarsh as judged from feeding behaviour of chicks and adults. As the season proceeded and the saltmarsh dried out, the broods moved toward the lakeshore. 4. As the density of plovers increased on lakeshore, the parents spent more time defending their young, and female parents stayed with their brood longer on the lakeshore. 5. We conclude that the influence of food abundance on breeding systems is more complex than currently anticipated.

Biome reconstructions were made using the objective biomization method applied to pollen counts using a complete list of dryland taxa wherever possible. Consistent and major differences from present-day biomes are shown. F orest and xerophytic woods/scrub were replaced by steppe, both in the Mediterranean region and in southern Africa, except in south-western Cape Province where fynbos (xerophytic scrub) persisted. Sites in the tropical highlands, characterized today by evergreen forest, were dominated by steppe and/or xerophytic vegetation (cf. today's Ericaceous belt and Afroalpine grass land) at the last glacial maximum. Available data from the tropical lowlands are sparse but suggest that the modern tropical rain forest was largely replaced by tropical seasonal forest while the modern seasonal or dry forests were encroached on by savanna or steppe. Montane forest elements descended to lower elevations than today.

Spatially explicit camera trap-based lion monitoring in Tanzania's Selous-Nyerere landscape	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Recent years have seen the emergence of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modeling as the recommended tool to monitor lion populations. In this study, we apply this method to camera trap data collected within Tanzania's Selous-Nyerere landscape, which is considered one of the species' few remaining strongholds in Africa. We estimated lion population density through SECR modeling of camera trap data from seven sites within Nyerere National Park (NP) and Selous Game Reserve (GR), the largest protected areas in the complex, to examine variation in lion population density. Our findings reveal lion population densities ranging from 0.33 (95% CIs: 0.12-0.91) lions over 1 year of age per 100 km2 in the dry eastern Miguruwe sector of Selous GR to 6.27 (95% CIs: 4.18-9.39) individuals over 1 year per 100 km2 in the prey-rich lakes area of the Matambwe sector of Nyerere NP. Dry season lion density in the system appears to be primarily driven by prey availability, which is itself principally determined by the productivity of miombo woodlands. However, evidence of human impacts and lower than expected densities at some sites suggest that anthropogenic pressure may be affecting Selous-Nyerere's lion population, particularly in areas close to boundaries. We show that camera trap-based monitoring combined with SECR can be a valuable tool to monitor lion populations in remote areas, particularly as it allows for simultaneous monitoring of other large carnivores, provides insights into wider mammal communities, aids the identification of threats, and can form the basis of sustainable offtake quotas. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of direct monitoring to understand how carnivore populations are faring and inform evidence-based conservation management.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				JUL	2025	326	3					256	267		10.1111/jzo.70019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jzo.70019		APR 2025											WOS:001472000700001

We analysed the vegetation structure of 215 lakes in the flood plain of the river Lower Rhine in relation to environmental variables related to hydrological connectivity, lake morphometry, lake age and land use on adjacent land. 2. The frequency distribution of the cover of submerged macrophytes was not normal, implying that submerged macrophytes in any one lake were either scarce or abundant. 3. We observed clear water lakes with submerged macrophyte dominance over a wide range of total P concentration (0.020-0.40 mg total P L-1). 4. Multiple logistic regression indicated that the probability of dominance by submerged macrophytes decreased markedly with the surface area, depth and age of the lakes. The surface area effect occurred independently of the depth. Further, there was a negative relationship between submerged macrophyte dominance and the long-term annual duration of inundation by the river. 5. Nymphaeid cover showed a distinct optimum with respect to mean lake depth, being almost absent in lakes shallower than 0.5 m. In contrast to what was found for submerged plants, the probability of occurrence of nymphaeids increased with lake age. 6. The probability of helophyte occurrence increased with lake age, and decreased with the presence of trees, cattle grazing, surface area, use of manure and mean lake depth. 7. In all cases the critical level of one factor (e.g. mean lake depth) depended on other factors (e.g. surface area or age of lake). Thus, in the present study, small lakes tended to remain dominated by submerged macrophytes up to a greater depth than large lakes, and helophytes colonised smaller lakes in an earlier phase. 8. The effect of inundation by the river was modest. This could be because most of our lakes are rarely inundated during the growing season and experience only moderate current velocities while flooded. 9. The results have practical implications for future management of flood plains for conservation purposes. In new water bodies, macrophyte domination will be promoted if many small shallow lakes, rather than few large deep ones, are excavated.

J	Holmroos, H; Niemistö, J; Weckström, K; Horppila, J				Holmroos, Heidi; Niemisto, Juha; Weckstrom, Kaarina; Horppila, Jukka			Seasonal variation of resuspension-mediated aerobic release of phosphorus	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												In shallow lakes, sediment resuspension can occur frequently. Therefore, the surface sediment is often well oxidized, and the effect of aerobic phosphorus release on internal nutrient loading can be substantial as compared with anoxic phosphorus release. The effect of resuspension on the aerobic release of phosphorus was studied in the field using experimental water columns. The study included three experiments that were conducted in May, August, and October in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin of Lake Hiidenvesi. The concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) increased substantially due to the 10-min resuspension event in all the experiments. However, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was strongly affected only in August, when the high pH levels promoted SRP release by ligand-exchange reactions. In August, the amount of resuspended TP remaining in the water column 4 hours after the resuspension event equalled the external phosphorus loading of 13 days. Moreover, 46% of the TP increase was in the form of SRP and thus significantly affected the availability of phosphorus for phytoplankton growth. The results demonstrated that resuspension brings substantial amounts of soluble phosphorus into the water column, providing that it occurs during algal blooms when pH in the water column is high. The effect of sediment resuspension on the availability of phosphorus in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin thus depends on conditions in the water column, which vary with the phase of the growing season.

As part of a project to reconstruct the long-term (Holocene) history of George VI Ice Shelf we studied two epishelf lakes impounded by the ice shelf at Ablation Point, on the east coast of Alexander Island. These lakes, Moutonnee and Ablation, are stratified water bodies with a lower marine layer and an upper freshwater layer. To determine if their sediment records could be used to detect past changes in the presence or absence of the ice shelf it was necessary to describe their present-day limnology and sedimentology. We measured water column chemistry and sampled the water column and sediments of the lakes along vertical and horizontal transects. We analysed these samples for diatoms, stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2, delta C-13(DIC), delta C-13(org)), geochemistry (TOC, TN, C/N ratios) and physical sedimentology (grain-size). This was supplemented by chemical and biological reference data from the catchments. Results showed that the water columns of both lakes are nutrient limited and deficient in phytoplankton. Benthic productivity is low and decreases with depth. Comparison of water column chemistry with an earlier survey shows a net increase in the thickness of the freshwater layer in Moutonnee Lake between 1973 and 2001, which could indicate that George VI Ice Shelf has thinned during this period. However, a similar trend was not observed in Ablation Lake (5 km to the north) and an alternative explanation is that the changes are a seasonal phenomena. Data from the surface sediment transects identified a number of proxies that respond to the present day stratification of the water column including diatom species composition, stable isotopes and geochemistry, particularly in Moutonnee Lake. Collectively these data have been used to develop a conceptual model for determining past ice shelf configuration in epishelf lakes. Specifically, periods of past ice shelf loss, and the removal of the ice dam, would see the present stratified epishelf lake replaced by a marine embayment. It is suggested that this change would leave a clear signature in the lake sediment record, notably the deposition of an exclusively marine biological assemblage, increased ice rafted debris and delta C-13(org) values that are indicative of marine derived organic matter.

Climate-induced changes must be assessed in the context of massive anthropogenic changes in water quantity and quality resulting from altered patterns of land use, water withdrawal, and species invasions; these may dwarf or exacerbate climate-induced changes. Water to meet instream needs is competing with other uses of water, and that competition is likely to be increased by climate change. We review recent predictions of the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems in eight regions of North America. Impacts include warmer temperatures that alter lake mixing regimes and availability of fish habitat; changed magnitude and seasonality of runoff regimes that alter nutrient loading and limit habitat availability at low flow; and loss of prairie pothole wetlands that reduces waterfowl populations. Many of the predicted changes in aquatic ecosystems are a consequence of climatic effects on terrestrial ecosystems; shifts in riparian vegetation and hydrology are particularly critical. We review models that could be used to explore potential effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems; these include models of instream flow, bioenergetics models, nutrient spiraling models, and models relating riverine food webs to hydrologic regime. We discuss potential ecological risks, benefits, and costs of climate change and identify information needs and model improvements that are required to improve our ability to predict and identify climate change impacts and to evaluate management options.

By employing systematic seasonal sampling, geospatial analysis, and statistical evaluation, the research highlights the spatial and temporal dynamics of solid waste accumulation across these diverse aquatic systems. During the sampling period, a total of 52,666 solid waste items were collected and analyzed from Bor & ccedil;ka Dam Lake (29,701 items), Muratl & imath; Dam Lake (6,917 items), Torul Dam Lake (11,635 items), and Uzungo<spacing diaeresis>l (4,413 items), revealing significant variations in litter abundance among the lakes, seasons, and years, with Bor & ccedil;ka Reservoir having the highest waste density and Uzungo<spacing diaeresis>l the lowest. Plastic waste emerged as the dominant category, accounting for over 60% of the total waste in all study sites, followed by metals, glass/ceramics, and paper/cardboard. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA, NMDS, and SIMPER, revealed distinct waste compositions across the lakes and seasons, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies. This research bridges a significant knowledge gap by focusing on long-term pollution dynamics in T & uuml;rkiye's inland waters, providing actionable insights for waste management and environmental conservation. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended to implement effective waste management systems, introduce stricter regulations, and raise public awareness through targeted campaigns.

Metals in sediment samples were analyzed by ICP-OES. The difference between the stations except for Zn metal (p < 0.05) has not been considered as important and a statistical difference between seasons for Fe, Ni metals (p < 0.01) and Cu metal (p < 0.05) has been observed. The magnitude of metal concentrations in sediment was determined as Aluminium > Iron > Manganese > Zinc > Chromium > Copper > Boron > Nickel > Lead > Cadmium. Enrichment factor (EF) for all metals has been calculated (EF < 1). In the evaluation done by considering the EF values, it is seen that the metal concentrations found in the Beyler Dam Lake sediment stem from the natural composition of the sediment.					; turan, murat/AAH-3054-2021; FINDIK, Özlem/AAY-2116-2021	FINDIK, Ozlem/0000-0001-8126-1250; 													0007-4861					FEB	2012	88	2					193	197		10.1007/s00128-011-0486-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-011-0486-6								22160166					WOS:000299328300016

The change in the spatial extent of landscape forms and vegetation types around the Qira oasis was analyzed by comparing SPOT satellite images from 1998 with aerial photographs from 1956. The analysis was supplemented by field surveys in 1999 and 2000. The study is part of a joint Chinese-European project with the aim of assessing the current state of the foreland vegetation, of gathering information on the regeneration potential and of suggesting procedures for a sustainable management. With 33 mm of annual precipitation, plants can only grow if they have access to groundwater, lakes or rivers. Most of the available water comes into the desert via rivers in the form of seasonal flooding events resulting from snow melt in the Kun Lun Mountains. This water is captured in canal systems and used for irrigation of arable fields. Among the eight herbaceous and woody vegetation types and the type of open sand without any plant life that were mapped in 2000 in the oasis foreland, only the latter, the oasis border between cultivated land and open Populus euphratica forests and Tamarix ramosissima-Phragmites australis riverbed vegetation could be clearly identified on the photographs from 1956. The comparison of the images revealed that the oasis increased in area between 1956 and 2000. Shifting sand was successfully combated near to the oasis borders but increased in extent at the outward border of the foreland vegetation. In contrast to expectations, the area covered with Populus trees was smaller in 1956 than today due to some new forests in the north of the oasis that have grown up since 1977. Subfossil wood and leaf remnants of Populus euphratica that were found in many places in the foreland must have originated from forests destroyed before 1956. In the last 50 years, the main Qira River has shifted its bed significantly northward and developed a new furcation with a large new bed in 1986. The natural river dynamics are not only an important factor in forming the oasis' landscape but also in providing the only possible regeneration sites for all occurring plant species. The conclusion of the study is that the oasis landscape has changed considerably in the last 50 years due to natural floodings and to vegetation degradation by human overexploitation. The trend towards decreasing width of the indigenous vegetation belt resulting from the advancing desert and the expansion of arable land is particularly alarming because a decrease in its protective function against shifting sand can be expected in the future.

Cryptophytes of Lake Shira (Khakassia, Russia): explosive growth during breakdown of meromixis	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We conducted a monitoring study on the dynamics of the abundance, biomass, and vertical distribution of the cryptophyte population in meromictic saline Lake Shira (90.11 E, 54.30 N) in the periods of stable meromixis (2012-2014), meromixis breakdown and mixing of the entire water column (2015-2016), and the subsequent reestablishment of meromixis (2017-2021). When stable stratification was broken down, cryptophyte biomass increased sharply: from 0.1 to 6 g m(-2) on average in the water column (to 4500 cells ml(-1) in the vertical maximum). The shape of the vertical distribution of cryptophytes has also changed. Changes in the abundance of cryptophytes caused by the breakdown of meromixis have largely endured after it was reestablished. Such a considerable increase of cryptophyte biomass did not correlate with the corresponding parameters of other components of the Lake mixolimnion ecosystem, whose biomass changed by a factor of no more than two. The explosive growth of cryptophyte abundance can be explained by a decrease in the trophic pressure of zooplankton-copepods and rotifers.

Average Cd, Pb and Hg levels were 0.016, 0.029 and 0.137 mg kg(-1), respectively. The average concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were 196.56, 84.8, and 218 mg 100g(-1), respectively. Yellowfin tuna contained higher DHA (148.2 mg 100g(-1)) than EPA (29.3 mg 100 g(-1)). A meal with 100 g of this species provides 48.6 and 71.05% of the required daily level of protein and EPA+DHA, respectively. Yellowfin tuna showed low thrombogenic (0.27) and atherogenic (0.43) potential and the value obtained for h/H index (1.97) indicates that regular intake of yellowfin tuna may bring hypocholesterolemic effect. All contaminants in the studied fish were either undetectable or present at very low levels when compared to the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), and European Union regulatory standards and yellowfin tuna would be one of the best options for people who frequently consume tuna fish to get sufficient EPA+DHA and essential elements.																			1094-2912	1532-2386				DEC 2	2015	18	12					2764	2775		10.1080/10942912.2015.1013631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2015.1013631													WOS:000359160500014

The average value of rho(TN) in three rivers (Mijuhe, Yonganjiang, and Luoshijiang rivers) flowing into the lake from the north was clearly higher than that in rivers flowing into the lake from the west. In contrast, the average value of rho(TP) in the three northern rivers was lower than that in the western rivers. In the dry season, the distribution of rho(TP) had a significant positive correlation with the distribution of rho(TN), but this was not significant in the rainy season. The average value of rho(CODMn) was within the Class I of "Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards of China".

At the time of the study, Mira and Vela faced large inputs of allochthonous nutrients, while Linhos was facing terrestrialisation, with cycles of dominance-senescence of macrophytes. The three lakes differed in terms of their abiotic features, with Linhos presenting very high nutrient levels and low pH, while Vela and Mira shared most of the characteristics. The rotifer communities of these two lakes were poorly diversified but highly abundant (max. > 2000 ind l(-1)), with a clear dominance of eurytopic euplanktonic species (mainly Keratella cochlearis). On the other hand, Linhos presented lower abundances (< 1000 ind l(-1)) but higher species richness, mainly due to macrophyte-associated taxa, such as the littoral genera Lepadella, Testudinella and Squatinella. In all lakes, summertime represented a peak in terms of abundance and diversity. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified two main environmental gradients that shape up the rotifer assemblages: a temporal gradient, mainly related to temperature, and a eutrophy gradient, associated with nitrogenous nutrients. The latter gradient is clearly dependent on between-lake variation, due to the high nutrient levels observed in lake Linhos. Variance partitioning using CCA revealed that the largest portion (27.5%) of the total variation explained (52.1%) was attributed to the interaction between lake and environmental variables.

R.			Oxygen and Triple Oxygen Isotope Measurements Provide Different Insights into Gross Oxygen Production in a Shallow Salt Marsh Pond	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The metabolism of estuarine environments is often estimated by measuring changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. A central assumption of common oxygen-based approaches is that oxygen consumption rates (primarily respiration) are similar under light and dark conditions. Evaluating this assumption is critical, especially in benthic-dominated systems, because differences between daytime and nighttime respiration could result in underestimation or overestimation of ecosystem productivity. We evaluated rates of gross oxygen production over hourly to seasonal time scales in a shallow, temperate salt marsh pond. To assess whether a dissolved oxygen diel mass balance underestimated gross oxygen productivity, we compared rates using this traditional approach and using the triple oxygen isotope tracer of photosynthesis. This is a powerful combination because the triple oxygen isotope approach is theoretically insensitive to respiration. The methods agreed well over daily to seasonal time scales. However, during midday periods of peak light and productivity, the triple oxygen isotope approach resulted in higher hourly scale gross oxygen production rates. The timing and magnitude of this short-term difference is consistent with light-dependent oxygen uptake fluxes including photoreduction and/or light-stimulated community respiration. Finally, aquatic vegetation was associated with variability in productivity across the pond. Such small-scale environmental heterogeneity is evidence that this shallow pond was not laterally well mixed, and likely contributes to the dynamism of these common estuarine environments.					; Manning, Cara/MIU-0003-2025	Karolewski, Jennifer/0000-0002-9969-4684; Sandwith, Zoe/0000-0001-9952-9526; Manning, Cara/0000-0002-4984-5093; Spivak, Amanda/0000-0001-6743-0783; Howard, Evan/0000-0002-1993-0692													1559-2723	1559-2731				DEC	2020	43	8					1908	1922		10.1007/s12237-020-00757-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-020-00757-6		JUL 2020											WOS:000549820700001

Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in two tropical rivers of varying size and human impact in Southeast Nigeria	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Phytoplankton occurrence and dynamics in rivers are mainly shaped by hydrophysical conditions and nutrient availability. Phytoplankton main structuring factors have been poorly studied in West African rivers, and this study was undertaken to identify these conditions in two tropical rivers that vary in size and human impact. For this, environmental variables and phytoplankton monthly samples were collected from the middle reaches of Asu and Cross rivers during an 18 months survey from March 2005-July 2006. Phytoplankton biomass (F=11.87, p=0.003), Shannon-Weiner diversity and species richness (F=5.93, p=0.003) showed significant seasonality in Asu but not in Cross River. Data was analyzed with Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and showed environmental differences between the two rivers, nitrate in Asu River (5.1-15.5mg/L) was significantly higher than Cross River (0.03-1.7mg/L), while PO, (0.2-0.9mg/L) was significantly lower in Asu River compared to Cross River (0.03-2.6mg/L) (p<0.05). Eutrophic factors (NO3) determined primarily phytoplankton dynamics in Asu River, especially during the dry season, whereas hydrophysical factors (depth, transparency and temperature) shaped phytoplankton in Cross River. Taxa indicative of an eutrophic condition, such as Euglena, Chlorella, Chlorococcus, Ceratium, Peridinium, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Closterium, Scenedesmus and Pediastrum spp., were frequently encountered in the shallow impounded Asu River, while riverine species, such as Frustulia rhomboids, Gyrosigma sp., Opephora martyr and Surirella splendida dominated Cross River. A succession pattem was observed in the functional groups identified: Na/MP -> TB -> P (rainy -> dry season) was observed in Asu River, whereas MP/D predominated in Cross River for both seasons. We concluded that, if nutrients predominate hydrophysical factors in shaping phytoplankton during dry season (half of the year) then, they are as important as hydrophysical factors structuring phytoplankton during rainy season (the other half).

J	Rowe, C				Rowe, Cassandra			A palynological investigation of Holocene vegetation change in Torres Strait, seasonal tropics of northern Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The islands of Torres Strait occupy a shallow area of submerged continental shelf narrowly separating Cape York Peninsula, Australia, from New Guinea. The human history of Torres Strait is unique with respect to mainland northern Australia. Island vegetation, however, exhibits a strong affinity with the environments of the western lowlands regions of Cape York Peninsula and with the vegetation of seasonal tropical Australia in general. Cape York Peninsula is both climatically and biologically diverse, yet few pollen studies have been carried out in its seasonally tropical environments. A summary presentation of palynological results, tracing the nature of vegetation change in Torres Strait, offers a possible framework for vegetation changes in similar environments on mainland Australia and also provides an opportunity to explore the relationship between Quaternary change in humid-tropical Australian environments and their seasonal-tropical counterparts. Six pollen records from Torres Strait provide evidence of vegetation change and fire history over approximately the last 8000 years. Near-shore sediments reveal a Holocene succession in vegetation incorporating lower-tidal mangrove, upper-tidal mangrove, saltmarsh and freshwater swamp communities. Extensive stable mangrove communities dominated coastal Torres Strait between approximately 6000 and 3000 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). Inland, the strongest Myrtaceae-forest and rainforest representation occurs around the mid-Holocene only to be replaced by open sclerophyll woodlands, as tree density and diversity decline in the last 3000 years. The development of continuous island freshwater swamp conditions, at the coast and inland, is similarly restricted to the late Holocene (c. 2600 yr BP) and fire, as a prominent feature in the Torres Strait environment, is also a relatively recent phenomenon. Comparisons with regional mainland Australian palynological records reveal a degree of consistency in results from Torres Strait suggesting a similarity in late Quaternary trends through Australian humid and seasonally tropical environments. A number of differences, however, are also apparent, highlighting a degree of diversity which warrants further attention. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Alonso-Sarria, F; Valdivieso-Ros, C; Molina-Pérez, G				Alonso-Sarria, Francisco; Valdivieso-Ros, Carmen; Molina-Perez, Gabriel			Detecting Flooded Areas Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Floods are a major threat to human life and economic assets. Monitoring these events is therefore essential to quantify and minimize such losses. Remote sensing has been used to extract flooded areas, with SAR imagery being particularly useful as it is independent of weather conditions. This approach is more difficult when detecting flooded areas in semi-arid environments, without a reference permanent water body, than when monitoring the water level rise of permanent rivers or lakes. In this study, Random Forest is used to estimate flooded cells after 19 events in Campo de Cartagena, an agricultural area in SE Spain. Sentinel-1 SAR metrics are used as predictors and irrigation ponds as training areas. To minimize false positives, the pre- and post-event results are compared and only those pixels with a probability of water increase are considered as flooded areas. The ability of the RF model to detect water surfaces is demonstrated (mean accuracy = 0.941, standard deviation = 0.048) along the 19 events. Validating using optical imagery (Sentinel-2 MSI) reduces accuracy to 0.642. This form of validation can only be applied to a single event using a S2 image taken 3 days before the S1 image. A large number of false negatives is then expected. A procedure developed to correct for this error gives an accuracy of 0.886 for this single event. Another form of indirect validation consists in relating the area flooded in each event to the amount of rainfall recorded. An RF regression model using both rainfall metrics and season of the year gives a correlation coefficient of 0.451 and RMSE = 979 ha using LOO-CV. This result shows a clear relationship between flooded areas and rainfall metrics.

J	Domingos, I; Costa, JL; Costa, MJ				Domingos, Isabel; Costa, Jose Lino; Costa, Maria Jose			Factors determining length distribution and abundance of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, in the River Mondego (Portugal)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The distribution and abundance of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, were investigated in the Mondego River, a strongly modified river in central Portugal. Nine freshwater sites, located below the first impassable obstacle to eel migration, were surveyed for 2 years. The study was conducted monthly during the first year and seasonally during the second year. Fish were caught by electric fishing and, physical and biotic variables potentially influencing eel length distribution and abundance were determined at each sampling session. 2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explain the relationships between abiotic and biotic habitat variables, and eel length distribution. Spatial variation was strongly associated with distance from the sea, number of obstacles, river width and percentage of instream cover. Depth, river flow, water temperature and cannibalism had weaker effects on the longitudinal distribution, but contributed as explanatory variables for the model. The influence of spatial variables outweighed the importance of temporal variables as predictors in this model. 3. Length distribution changed in space from a dominance of small eels (< 100 mm) closer to the sea to larger eels ( >= 250 mm) in the upper reaches of the river. The smallest length class (eels < 100 mm) was strongly associated with wider stretches where instream cover, mainly composed of aquatic submerged macrophytes, was abundant (> 75% area coverage). On the contrary, larger eels ( >= 250 mm) preferred deeper stretches with stronger river flow and less instream cover. 4. The effect of biotic interactions with conspecifics as well as with the non-native red swamp crayfish Procambartis clarkii, in sites with poor instream cover, modified this general pattern of distribution leading to fewer eels < 100 mm at some sites closer to the sea. Therefore, despite the ubiquity and plasticity shown by this species, there were clear ontogenetic variations in habitat use such that the first two canonical axes of a CCA accounted for 58.4% of the spatial variability in size structure.

The relationships of absorbance/dissolved organic carbon (A/DOC), fluorescence intensity/dissolved organic carbon (FI/DOC), fluorescence ratio (FR), and peak wavelength with the highest intensity (PW) were used to distinguish the pedogenic or aquagenic origin of NOM. The values of FR, PW and A(285)/DOC of high waters (HW) or flooded period samples and of low waters (LW) period samples of the dry season, except for September 2002, confirm the predominance of pedogenic material. The spectra of water were similar to the standard ftilvic acid (FA), and the spectra of FA from the lake were similar to the nearby soils, indicative of pedogenic predominance. The results confirm that the dissolved NOM of Patos Lagoon - MS (Brazil), in all sampling periods, predominantly consisted of humic substances (FA) of pedogenic origin.

Comparison of fatty acid composition of cladocerans and copepods from lakes of different climatic zones	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												We have studied the fatty acid (FA) contents and composition of cladocerans and copepods from warm and cold lakes. We have found no significant differences in FA percent levels and per carbon contents of cladocerans from warm and cold lakes or of copepods from warm and cold lakes. A discriminant analysis showed that all cladocerans differed from all copepods mainly due to the content of docosahexaenoic acid. Compared to cladocerans, copepods had significantly higher levels of all C22 polyunsaturated FA. Thus, we conclude that cladocerans and copepods in all environments had comparatively invariant taxon-specific compositions and contents of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs). According to HUFA content, all studied copepods can be regarded as a valuable food for fish.

Movements and seasonal use of habitats by rural and urban female mottled ducks in southeast Florida	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Florida will continue to undergo high rates of habitat loss, primarily the result of urbanization. In addition, invasive species are a major threat to Florida's biodiversity. The Florida mottled duck (Anas fulvigula), a bird unique to the state, is particularly vulnerable to loss of wetland habitats and hybridization with feral mallards. Because mottled ducks are more likely to encounter feral mallards in urban habitats, we trapped and radiomarked adult females in urban (n=99) and rural (n=146) habitats to estimate home ranges and rates of movement into and out of urban areas. We also determined habitat use in urban and rural areas during the breeding (1 Feb-31 Jul), post-breeding (1 Aug-18 Nov), and hunting (19 Nov-31 Jan) periods and estimated seasonal habitat selection of rural female mottled ducks. Urban females used mostly aquatic habitats in low and high intensity human development year-round. Rural ducks used freshwater marshes throughout the year, but selection of other habitat types varied seasonally. Use of glades marsh and agricultural habitats by rural ducks peaked during the breeding season. Rural ducks selected artificial impoundments and reservoirs during the post-breeding and hunting periods. Median home range size of rural females was more than 65 times greater than those of urban females. Our results suggest the spread of mallard genetic introgression caused by females leaving urban areas may be slow because as few as 6% of the adult females moved between urban and rural areas. Focusing wetland conservation efforts on freshwater marshes and artificial impoundments in south Florida would likely benefit mottled ducks.

The severe drought during 1998 - 1999 in the northeastern region of Brazil induced ecological changes in numerous reservoirs as in Tapacura reservoir, one of the biggest drinking-water suppliers in Pernambuco state. Investigations were based on monthly sampling over 2 years ( May 1998 - May 2000) conducted at 3 representative stations with 3 sampled depths through the water column (0.5 m, middle and 0.5 m above the bottom). Temporal changes in ecological processes, especially stratification, were driven by two major precipitation patterns, with an initial marked dry period ( period 1) followed by a rainy season ( period 2). Dissolved oxygen and pH variations, higher conductivity and alkalinity values, higher concentrations of particulate organic material ( carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and higher levels of algal biomass ( chlorophyll a) characterized the dry period ( May 1998 - May 1999). During this phase of low water level when the reservoir storage capacity reached a minimum of 3.9%, the concentrations of chlorophyll a gradually increased with a cyanobacterial bloom (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) noted in April 1999. The decline in chlorophyll a and particulate organic matter were observed as a result of the first rains in May June 1999, with the drastic changes of quality of matter ( higher particulate C/N ratio). After a phase characterized by the entire water column turning anoxic, a second phase in the stratification process could be identified from June 1999 with the pronounced rainfalls accompanied by an overturn event. Annual rainfall deficit and lack of reservoir water renewal in 1998 - 1999 linked to the 1997 El Nino consequences were important determinants of high eutrophication levels and drastic ecological modifications in Tapacura reservoir.

Parasites alter behavior, reproductive output, and growth patterns of Aurelia medusae in a marine lake	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Parasites are known to induce phenotypic modifications in their hosts through direct competition for resources, which can negatively affect host fitness. Although parasite-induced phenotypic variation has been studied extensively in terrestrial and freshwater taxa, this phenomenon remains comparatively under-studied in marine pelagic invertebrates, such as ecologically important jellyfish. Here we studied the parasite-host relationship between Edwardsiella sp. anemone larvae (parasite) and medusae of Aurelia sp. 5 (host) in an isolated marine lake (Veliko Jezero) in Croatia. During 3 different seasons, we quantified differences in the vertical position in the water column, morphology, and egg production between parasitized and unparasitized medusae. Our results revealed that medusa behavior, morphology, and fecundity can be significantly affected by parasitism. Infected medusae were more abundant higher in the water-column where water was warmer, while unparasitized individuals displayed the opposite pattern. In addition, host somatic growth, gonad size, and egg production were negatively affected by parasitism, suggesting an ultimate negative effect on medusa fecundity. Parasitized individuals, however, developed relatively longer manubria and produced larger eggs than unparasitized counterparts, indicating a compensatory response to increase capture surface and reproductive effort. This study demonstrates the extent of parasite-induced phenotypic variation in jellyfish as well as the role of parasites in potential regulation of jellyfish population size.

High temporal variations of total phosphorus in surface water were observed, ranging from 42 mu/L to 250 mu g/L during the two years of monitoring at the center of the lake, and 134 mu/L to 737 mu/L during the one month of monitoring in Meiliang Bay during the algal bloom season. High variation in phytoplankton biomass during the bloom season significantly affected total-phosphorus concentration in lake water. The accumulated total phosphorus in algae may be caused by the release from sediment during the blooms. Intensive sediment resuspension caused by wind-induced waves also had significant effects on total phosphorus. Therefore, care should be taken when using total phosphorus or ratios of total nitrogen to total phosphorus for trophic state evaluation in large, shallow and eutrophic lakes. Water Environ.

J	Melaram, R; Lopez-Duenas, B				Melaram, Rajesh; Lopez-Duenas, Brandon			Detection and Occurrence of Microcystins and Nodularins in Lake Manatee and Lake Washington-Two Floridian Drinking Water Systems	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Clean, fresh, and safe drinking water is essential to human health and well-being. Occasionally, biological contaminants taint surface water quality used for human consumption and recreation. Microcystins (MCs) and nodularins (NODs) are toxic monocyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria in fresh and brackish water. These secondary metabolites can reach hazardous concentrations, impairing surface drinking water supplies and thereby increasing the risk of exposure to consumers. Inconsistent screening of MCs and NODs is not uncommon in drinking water systems and no provisional guidance value has been established in Florida to protect community and public health. We performed a case study of two Florida lakes supplying drinking water to adjacent communities for the purpose of monitoring MCs and NODs over the potential peak algae bloom season (June-August). An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) was employed to analyze concentrations of total MCs and NODs in environmental water samples from Lake Manatee and Lake Washington. Toxin concentrations were similar in each lake, averaging 0.19 mu g/L. The highest toxin concentration (0.46 mu g/L) was reported in Lake Manatee at Site 15, a location where other toxin concentrations demonstrated statistical significance with toxins detected at Sites 6 (p = 0.014) and 8 (p = 0.011). Inferential analyses from the Kruskal-Wallis H Test revealed a statistically significance difference in toxin concentrations by sampling month within the two Floridian drinking water systems (p < 0.001). Furthermore, phosphate and nitrite concentrations strongly correlated with total MCs and NODs in each lake (p < 0.01). Although results indicate a low probable health risk from cyanotoxins, more research is needed to understand the intrinsic nature of MCs and NODs by examining their prevalence, distribution, and dynamics in surface drinking water supplies serving nearby communities.

We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time PCR to target the molecular biomarker gene of ammonia monooxygenase subunit A. Both phylogenetic analyses and the dominant terminal restriction fragments showed that archaeal ammonia oxidizers belonged to the Crenarchaeota Group I.1a and Crenarchaeota Group I.1b, while bacterial ammonia oxidizers included both Nitrosomonas-like and Nitrosospira-like species. The bacterial ammonia oxidizers were more diverse but less abundant than the ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Significant spatial differences in the ammonia-oxidizing archaeal community structure and abundance were found between the algae-dominated and the macrophyte-dominated regions, which suggest sedimentary trophic status is an important influence. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between bacterial ammonia oxidizer communities and sedimentary trophic status. There were pronounced seasonal variations in ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community structures, reflected by the absence of the Nitrosospira-like species in August and their presence in other months. Both the abundances of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers were highest in February. The correlation analyses between prokaryotic ammonia oxidizer communities and the investigated physicochemical variables demonstrated that the overlying water temperature was the dominant factor influencing the seasonal variations in ammonia oxidizer community structure and abundance.

ANALYSIS OF MIGRATION OF AQUATIC AND SEMIAQUATIC BIRDS ON THE TERRITORY OF THE REPUBLIC OF DAGESTAN AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE CHOICE OF KEY POINTS OF MONITORING OF INFLUENZA A VIRUS	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. The aim of the work is to carry out an analysis of the wetlands of the Republic of Dagestan in order to justify the selection of the collecting sites for material from migratory aquatic and semi aquatic birds in order to monitor the influenza A virus. Material and methods. Studying scientific publications of different years and available information on the wetlands of the Caspian Dagestan allowed establishing the areas of concentration of aquatic and semiaquatic birds where effective sampling for avian influenza is possible. Results. The spread of avian influenza viruses in nature is inextricably linked with migration of birds. Due to the presence of a large number of reservoirs, the western part of the Caspian region brings together large populations of wild waterbirds from various places within their migration routes. Mass accumulation encourages the interaction of birds of different species and populations, which in turn creates favorable conditions for the spread of various viral diseases. Conclusion. For an integrated assessment of the state of aquatic and semiaquatic bird populations, as well as monitoring the avian influenza infection rates, it is proposed to consider as model areas the wetlands of the Lake Aji (Papas), Lake Yuzhny Agrakhan, Agrakhansky Gulf, the Terek River delta and the Achikolsky systems of lake.

Geographic variation in fatty acid composition and food source of the commercial clam (Venerupis decussata, Linnaeus, 1758), from the Tunisian Coast: Trophic links	GRASAS Y ACEITES												Lake and coastal Tunisian areas are rich biodiversity habitats, although little information is available about the distribution of food sources for the inhabitant species. In this study, a fatty acid analysis was used to study the trophic ecology of Venerupis decussatac ommunities from 10 sites located along the Tunisian Coast. The richest population in fatty acids was found in S4 followed by S5 and S8, while that of S1, S3 and S10 were the least rich. Results from multivariate analysis confirmed the ecological position of the studied population based on their fatty acid composition. Our results divided the ten studied populations into three similar groups according to their ecological and geographical positions in relation to environmental parameters and food and trophic links. A principal component analysis revealed that diatoms and dinoflagellates were the predominate diets in all the sampling stations. Bacteria and urban discharge dominated the dietary source of clams from S10 and S9. Zooplankton were the preferred diet of V claimant harvested from the two S2 and S3 lakes; although green algae, phytoplankton and detritus were absent from the dietary source of the two previous populations. Despite spatial differences, clams from the north and the south could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of different food chain links. This study proves that geographic, ecologic and abiotic factors as well as their mutual interaction should be properly investigated in studies focusing on the trophic chains of aquatic ecosystems.					; BOUSSOUFA, Dhouha/ADJ-2348-2022	El Cafsi, M'hamed/0000-0002-9771-1110; telahigue, Khaoula/0000-0001-8841-9911													0017-3495	1988-4214				JAN-MAR	2019	70	1							e289	10.3989/gya.0580181	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/gya.0580181													WOS:000456872300006

The Neostratotype of Itapecuru Formation (Lower-Middle Albian) and Its Impact for Mesozoic Stratigraphy of Parnaiba Basin	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												This study defines the neostratotype of the Lower-Middle Albian Itapecuru Formation in the Parnaiba Basin, Northeast Brazil. In this sedimentary succession along the right bank of the Itapecuru River near the Itapecuru-Mirim City, Maranhao State. three lithofacies associations are recognized. The first is silty claystone with some very fine sand, micaceous, reddish color. thin laminated, showing a tabular aspect, interpreted as floodplain fines in a distal position. The second is clayey siltstone, reddish color, with ripple cross-lamination, very thin cross-laminated wacke lenses, grading to thin parallel lamination, in apparently tabular layers, interpreted as crevasse splay and distributive channels deposits in successive avulsion events. The third is fine quartz wacke. reddish to grayish color, showing grouped trough cross bedding, interpreted as channel filling deposits. These facies associations correspond to part of a fluvial depositional system, with predominantly fine-grained rocks, and small lakes in the floodplain, in an oxidizing environment and marked by seasonality. These field data, reinforced by grain size and petrographic analyses showed that, contrary to previous descriptions, the Itapecuru Formation consists mainly of mudrocks. This research also shows that the medium to coarse sandstones and conglomerates, previously included in the Itapecuru Formation, belong to the underlying Grajau Formation.

Comparison of fluorometric and microscopical quantification of phytoplankton in a drinking water reservoir by a one-season monitoring program	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phytoplankton are key components in aquatic ecosystems and therefore an important target of monitoring analyses. Microscopical counting, although providing most detailed results, is time and labor intensive and requires highly skilled analysts. In situ spectral fluorescence measurements provide a much faster analysis with a higher spatiotemporal resolution. A one-season survey of phytoplankton assemblages was performed in order to compare the results of the spectrofluorometric measurements to classical microscopical determination in different sections of a drinking water reservoir. The investigations were performed with the spectrofluorometer FluoroProbe (FP) by bbe Moldaenke GmbH (Kiel, Germany), which is designed to discriminate among diatoms, green algae, Cryptophyta and cyanobacteria. The results of phytoplankton quantification as revealed by total chlorophyll a (Chla) measurements with the FP and total biovolumes determined by microscopy showed a good correlation.The accordance between the two approaches was best for diatoms and much lower for the other spectral groups. The proportion of green algae was generally overestimated by FP measurements in comparison to biovolumes. Contrary, the percentage of cyanobacteria was often underestimated by FP compared to microscopical analyses. A clear underestimation of cyanobacteria by FP measurements even at high abundances of Microcystis sp. was observed in two samples. No influence of species composition on the congruence between microscopical analyses and FP measurements was detected.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2019	81	1							19	10.1007/s00027-018-0608-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-018-0608-x													WOS:000454774300006

This study examined the seasonal characteristics of fluorescent CDOM components in the Yinma and Songhua rivers, highly polluted watershed tributaries of the Songhua River, and a drinking water source for the city of Changchun, China. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra were used to assess CDOM fluorescence. Four components attributed to CDOM in 51 water samples were identified: three were humic-like (C1, C3, and C4) and one was protein-like (C2). The average fluorescence intensities of the four components showed seasonal variation from May to November 2016. A positive linear correlation was found between components C3 and C4 (R = 0.86, p<0.001). The results from this investigation demonstrated that the frequency of rainfall and human activities may be the main factors influencing the quantity and quality of CDOM in samples collected from the watershed, and that the Yinma and Yitong rivers were polluted by terrestrial and agricultural pollution. Furthermore, the utility of combining EEM fluorescence and PARAFAC to study CDOM dynamics for different seasons and to quantify CDOM components for similar environmental (water quality) conditions was established.

This anadromous cyprinid fish migrates for spawning to the freshwater inlets pouring into Lake Van, which has highly alkaline and brackish water. During the migration, the fish moves to a new habitat from a different habitat and encounters many challenges. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether antioxidant responses occur in the tissues of A. tarichi during its anadromous migration. To this end, fish were sampled at three different points and in two different periods from the migration route, including in Lake Van at prespawning, at the entrance of a freshwater stream (Karasu) at spawning and in the upstream of the freshwater stream at spawning. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant defenses including activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase and the level of glutathione were assayed in liver, gill, white muscle, trunk kidney and anterior intestine tissues. Our results showed increased MDA levels in liver, white muscle and anterior intestine and tissue-specific antioxidant responses in the freshwater environment. This study reports that alterations occurred in the antioxidant defense system indicators in the tissues of anadromous cyprinid fish during migration and that the antioxidant defenses might reflect an important role in spawning migration that ultimately leads to accomplishment of reproductive activity.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the proximal composition of the meat of the puna teal duck (Spatula puna), Andean coot (Fulica ardesiaca), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) and Titicaca grebe (Rollandia microptera), and their possibilities of sensorial acceptance by people not accustomed to their consumption. Moisture content, protein, fat, ash, carbohydrates and energy were determined, considering six replicates per species. Sensory evaluations of raw meat were also conducted through a panel of 24 judges who determined its acceptability. All the meats have moisture between 71 and 76% and protein between 18 and 22%, with differences among species, highlighted by the Andean coot with 22.38%. The fat concentration differed among species, with the common moorhen having the highest content with 5.9%. Ash ranged between 0.8 and 1%, carbohydrate contents did not exceed 1% and the common moorhen had the highest energy level with 142.98 kcal 100 g(-1). The highest energy amount was related to the highest fat levels (r = 0.83) and the moisture content with lower protein contents (r = -0.82); the highest protein content occurred in the dry season and the highest fat content in the rainy season. Organoleptically, the meats were not accepted by the panel, cataloging them as only fair.

Here we investigate the influence of ecological drift on periphytic diatom community composition in arctic lakes. If community composition is strongly influenced by drift, we hypothesize that (i) alpha diversity will increase with increasing lake size, due to the decreasing influence of drift-mediated local extinction, (ii) beta diversity will be greatest among small lakes and lowest in large lakes, and (iii) relationships between community size and environmental variables will be strongest in large lakes and weakest in small lakes. Analysis was conducted on periphytic diatoms accrued on artificial substrates in 44 shallow, thermokarst lakes over the 2009 growing season. Limnological and hydrological conditions at each site were described and their influence was removed to minimize the confounding effect of environmental heterogeneity. Alpha diversity was not significantly different among the lake sizes. Total beta diversity was significantly higher in the small lakes than the medium lakes. Beta diversity was primarily attributed to turnover, and small lakes had significantly higher turnover than medium and large lakes, while nestedness was not significantly different among lake-size classes. Periphytic diatom community composition and environmental variables were not significantly concordant in any lake-size class. Our results suggest that drift, as related to habitat size, is not a primary driver of periphytic diatom community composition in shallow, thermokarst arctic lakes.

RESEARCH ON ECOSYSTEM HEALTH ASSESSMENT INDICES AND THRESHOLDS OF A LARGE YANGTZE-CONNECTED LAKE, POYANG LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Assessing the aquatic ecosystem health status of lakes has been the focus of lake studies for domestic and overseas researchers and water resource managers. Poyang Lake, which is one of the only two remaining large Yangtze-connected lakes in the middle reaches of Yangtze River in China, provides considerable ecosystem service functions, such as flood water storage, water supply for industrial and agricultural production, maintenance of the unique and diverse biota of the entire Yangtze floodplain ecosystem, maintenance of regional ecological balance and so on. However, due to the impact of climate change and human activities, Poyang Lake has experienced drastic hydrological changes, water quality decline and aquatic ecological function degradation in recent years. An assessment of the aquatic ecosystem health of Poyang Lake is of great importance. On the basis of the index system construction principles and a meta-analysis of previous research, this paper puts forward the index system for the ecosystem health assessment of Poyang Lake. The indices contains the three element layers of aquatic organisms, hydrologic characteristics and trophic status and the five indicators of ratio of cyanobacteria biomass to diatom biomass (CB/DB), diversity index of macrozoobenthos, lowest water level anomaly during the dry season, mean water level anomaly during rising season and trophic state index (TLI). Then, the thresholds of indicators are determined using empirical study, frequency analysis, standard specification and so on. Aquatic ecosystem health status is categorised into three groups: 'good', `moderate' and 'poor'. The study could provide theoretical basis for identifying the causes of the lake aquatic ecosystem health degeneration and protecting the environment of Poyang Lake. This present study provides an attempt to quantify the aquatic ecosystem health in a large floodplain lake with dramatic hydrological variations and will give some impetus for floodplain ecosystem assessment and management worldwide.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	5					11701	11716		10.15666/aeer/1705_1170111716	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1705_1170111716													WOS:000490563900096

Sampling rates, determined using depuration compounds pre-spiked into the PUF disk prior to exposure, were, on average, 2.9 +/- 1.1 m(3) d(-1), consistent with previous studies employing these samplers. PCN air concentrations exhibited strong urbanrural differences-typically a few pg m(-3) at rural sites and an order of magnitude higher at urban sites (Toronto, 12-31 pg m(-3) and Chicago, 13-52 pg m(-3)). The high concentrations at urban sites were attributed to continued emissions of historically used technical PCN. Contributions from combustion- derived PCNs seemed to be more important at rural locations where congeners 24 and 50, associated with wood and coal burning, were elevated. Congener 66/67, associated with incineration and other industrial thermal processes, was elevated at two sites and explained by nearby and/or upwind sources. Probability density maps were constructed for each site and for every integration period were shown to be a useful complement to seasonally integrated passive sampling data to resolve source-receptor relationship for PCNs and other pollutants.

A total of fifty (50) surface sediment samples was collected during the dry and rainy season. Physico-chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity and organic matter) and nine (09) trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb) were analysed in the sediment samples. The concentrations of studied trace metals were compared to various standards such as the United State Environmental Protection Agency standard (USEPA), the world river system (WRS), and the probable effect concentration (PEC). To assess the intensity of trace metal contamination in sediments and to identify the potential origins of trace metals, pollution indices, ecological risk assessment and multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) were used. The pollution indices were calculated using continental background concentrations. The results of physico-chemical characterization showed that sediments were acidic to neutral (5.73-7.63), weakly conductive (20-1830 mu S cm(-1)) and the organic matter (OM) ranged from 0.97 to 5.10%. The sequence of trace metal mean concentrations in sediments was Fe > Mn > Ni > Cu > Cr > Zn > Co > Pb > As. The mean concentrations of Ni and Cu exceeded the average shale concentrations (ASC) and all the studied standards and indicators. According to pollution indices and ecological risk assessments, significant contamination factor of Cu (CF = 5.66) was observed with a contamination degree (CD) varying from low (3.08) to significant (16.71). The Nemerow index (NI) indicated high potential risk exhibited in some sampling points. The ecological risk index (E-r(i)) for all the trace metals was low (E-r(i) <= 40) and the geo-accumulation index (I-geo) generally ranged from uncontaminated to moderately contaminated (I(geo )0-1). Significant enrichment was found for Ni (13.31) and Cu (11.82). Multivariate statistical analysis revealed strong linear correlations between Fe-Pb (R = 0.73) and Fe-Ni (R = 0.70). Assessment of contamination intensity in sediments in the studied section of Lom River globally suggested moderate to significant contamination by trace metals but the sediment quality may degrade in the near future due to increasing of anthropogenic inputs.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2022	81	14							379	10.1007/s12665-022-10501-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10501-x													WOS:000826166000001

Can correlational analyses help determine the drivers of microcystin occurrence in freshwater ecosystems? A meta-analysis of microcystin and associated water quality parameters	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Microcystin (MC) is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by select cyanobacteria that threatens aquatic and terrestrial organisms over a diverse range of freshwater systems. To assess the relationship between environmental parameters and MC, researchers frequently utilize correlational analyses. This statistical methodology has proved useful when summarizing complex water quality monitoring datasets, but the correlations between select parameters and MC have been documented to vary widely across studies and systems. Such variation within the peer-reviewed literature leaves uncertainty for resource managers when developing a MC monitoring program. The objective of this research is to determine if correlational analyses between environmental parameters and MC are helpful to resource managers desiring to understand the drivers of MC. Environmental (i.e., physical, chemical, and biological) and MC correlation data were retrieved from an estimated 2,643 waterbodies (largely from the north temperate region) and synthesized using a Fisher's z meta-analysis. Common water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll, temperature, and pH, were positively correlated with MC, while transparency was negatively correlated. Interestingly, 12 of the 15 studied nitrogen parameters, including total nitrogen, were not significantly correlated with MC. In contrast, three of the four studied phosphorus parameters, including total phosphorus, were positively related to MC. Results from this synthesis quantitatively reinforces the usefulness of commonly measured environmental parameters to monitor for conditions related to MC occurrence; however, correlational analyses by themselves are often ineffective and considering what role a parameter plays in the ecology of cyanobacterial blooms in addition to MC production is vital.					; Fernandez-Figueroa, Edna/AGU-8926-2022	Gladfelter, Matthew/0000-0001-7481-3977; Fernandez-Figueroa, Edna G./0000-0002-0055-3313													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2022	194	7							493	10.1007/s10661-022-10114-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10114-8								35690674					WOS:000809556400001

These organisms frequently inhabit variable seasonal environments, where favorable periods alternate with unfavorable periods, generating temporally varying selection pressures that strongly influence life history decisions and hence population dynamics. Due to the rapidly accelerating changes in our global environment today, understanding the population dynamics and genetic changes in facultative sexual populations inhabiting seasonal environments is critical to assess and prepare for additional challenges that will affect such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at obtaining insights into the seasonal population dynamics of the facultative sexual freshwater cnidarian Hydra oligactis through a combination of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) genotyping and the collection of phenotypic data on the reproductive strategy of field-collected hydra strains in a standard laboratory environment. We reliably detected 42 MlGs from the 121 collected hydra strains. Most of MLGs (N = 35, 83.3%) were detected in only one season. Five MLGs (11.9%) were detected in two seasons, one (2.4%) in three seasons and one (2.4%) in all four seasons. We found no significant genetic change during the 2 years in the study population. Clone lines were detected between seasons and even years, suggesting that clonal lineages can persist for a long time in a natural population. We also found that distinct genotypes differ in sexual reproduction frequency, but these differences did not affect whether genotypes reappeared across samplings. Our study provides key insights into the biology of natural hydra populations, while also contributing to understanding the population biology of facultative sexual species inhabiting freshwater ecosystems.

Phytoplankton, as the main producer of aquatic ecosystem, its diversity, productivity, and community stability are of great significance to reveal ecosystem function. There are significant differences in hydrodynamics, water retention time, and phytoplankton community structure between river-type reservoir and newly built lake-type reservoir. The comparative analysis of phytoplankton community stability between the two types of reservoir has not been reported. Jiuquwan Reservoir (river-type) and Taihu Reservoir (laketype), the two reservoirs in the Dongjiang River source area of Zhujiang (Pearl) River Basin, were selected for comparison in terms of multi-year operation vs. new impoundment, river-type vs. lake-type, and shallow water vs. sub-deep water reservoirs. Samples were collected in dry season (December 2019), normal season (March 2020), and wet season (August 2020), on which the phytoplankton diversity and productivity of the two reservoirs, and the relationship and difference of community stability were examined. Results show that (1) the number of phytoplankton species in Jiuquwan Reservoir decreased comparing that before algal bloom and the restoration treatment, while that in Taihu Reservoir increased compared with that before the impoundment of the reservoir. There was no significant difference in functional groups and species number between the two reservoirs ( P >0.05); (2) the biological stability, diversity, productivity, and resource utilization efficiency of newly built lake-type reservoir were higher than those of multi-year river-type reservoir. In addition, the utilization efficiency of phytoplankton resources was the highest in wet season in both reservoirs. The increases in biodiversity, richness, and evenness promoted the stability of the community, while increases in productivity and resource utilization efficiency weakened the stability of the community; (3) community stability was affected by both biotic and abiotic factors, and hydrodynamic index was the main factor. This study is helpful to understand the relationship and differences in phytoplankton diversity, productivity and community stability in different types of reservoirs, and provides a guidance for maintaining the stability of reservoir water ecosystem and protecting the biodiversity. The relationships between phytoplankton diversity, productivity, and community stability will be investigated in depth, for which a long-term observation will be conducted on the impact of environmental factors and diversity on the local biostability in different types of reservoirs.

We describe the various actions planned in this project. We first detail the actions planned in gravimetry which consist in two main surface gravity experiments: on the one hand the periodic repetition of absolute gravity measurements along a north-south monsoonal gradient of rainfall in West Africa, going from Tamanrasset (20 mm/year) in southern Algeria to Djougou (1200 mm/year) in central Benin; on the other hand the continuous measurements at Djougou (Benin) with a superconducting gravimeter to monitor with a higher sampling rate the gravity changes related to an extreme hydrological cycle. Another section describes the actions planned in GPS which will maintain and develop the present-day existing network in West Africa. The third type of actions deals with hydrology and we review the three sites that will be investigated in this joint hydrogeophysics project namely Wankama (near Niamey) and Bagara (near Diffa) in the Niger Sahelian zone and Nalohou (near Djougou) in the Benin monsoon zone. We also address the question of the ground truth of satellite-derived missions: in this context the GHYRAF project will lead to test the hydrology models by comparison both with in situ and satellite data such as GRACE, as well as to an important increase of our knowledge of the seasonal water cycle in Africa. We finally present preliminary results in GPS based on the analysis of the vertical motion of the Djougou site. The resulting absolute gravity changes related to the 2008 monsoon are finally given.

Phylogenetic diversity of transition and anoxic zone bacterial communities within a near-shore anoxic basin: Nitinat Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>At two stations surveyed in Nitinat Lake, a similar to 200-m-deep anoxic tidal fjord, sulfide was detected as close as 15 m from the surface. Biological characterization, determined from small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, of the chemocline and anaerobic zone revealed many sequences related to sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting that sulfur cycling is a dominant process. gamma- and epsilon-Proteobacteria related to thiotrophic symbionts, as well as Chlorobium sp., dominated the transition zone. These are expected to play a role in dark and phototrophic CO2 fixation, respectively. epsilon-Proteobacteria phylotype abundance increased with depth, eventually comprising 69-97% of all sequences recovered from the anoxic zone. The vast majority (74%) of these phylotypes were affiliated with a novel Acrobacter sp. group (NITEP5). Quantification of NITEP5 revealed that up to 2.8 x 105 cells ml-1 were present in the anoxic zone. Surprisingly, although sequences related to known sulfate-reducing bacteria were recovered from the transition zone, quantification of the dsr gene and 35SO(4)2- uptake tests suggest that sulfate-reduction within the water column is negligible. Overall, sequence diversity between different vertical zones was high, although the spatial segregation of gamma-Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, and epsilon-Proteobacteria did not appear to vary significantly between seasons.																			1462-2912	1462-2920				DEC	2009	11	12					3233	3251		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02044.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02044.x								19735278					WOS:000273182500026

We investigated the dynamics of PPP and heterotrophic bacteria (HBact) in Lake Tanganyika during the dry and rainy seasons of 2004 to 2007, in the two basins of this large lake. Flow cytometry analyses showed that PPP was mainly composed by PCya of the phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus type, with maximal abundances (2.3 x 10(4)-8.2 x 10(5) cells mL(-1)) found in the mixolimnion (10-20 m depth). PPP biomass integrated over the water column depth ranged between 0.41 and 3.09 g C m(-2), with maximal values in the south basin during the dry season (2.28 +/- 0.62 g C m(-2) on average). The contribution of PPP to total phytoplankton biomass ranged from 41 to 99%, with highest values in the south basin in the dry season. Cellular measurements by image analysis of epifluorescence microscopy images showed a significant increase of the cell volume of the PCya during this period. Flow cytometry also allowed enumeration of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes. Assuming a conversion factor of 530 fg C cell(-1), they contributed on average to 6% to PPP biomass, except during the dry season in the south basin, where their contribution increased to up to 20% of PPP biomass. Integrated over a 100-m water column depth, PCya biomass was on average 1.4 times higher than HBact biomass. This study establishes reference values for the biomass contribution of this part of the microbial food web, covering for the first time, spatial (different sites), vertical (profiles at different depths) and seasonal variations on a multi-year basis. The results strengthen the view of a major role of PPP in the pelagic food web of large tropical Lake Tanganyika.

SEDIMENTOLOGICAL CONTROLS ON PLANT-FOSSIL PRESERVATION IN AN EOCENE CALDERA-LAKE FILL: A HIGH-RESOLUTION, AGE-CONSTRAINED RECORD FROM THE TUFOLITAS LAGUNA DEL HUNCO, CHUBUT PROVINCE, ARGENTINA	PALAIOS												Caldera lake sediments of the early Eocene Tufolitas Laguna del Hunco (Chubut Province, Argentina) host one of the world's best-preserved and most diverse fossil plant assemblages, but the exceptional quality of preservation remains unexplained. The fossils have singular importance because they include numerous oldest and unique occurrences in South America of genera that today are restricted to the West Pacific region, where many of them are now vulnerable to extinction. Lacustrine depositional settings are often considered optimal for preservation as passive receptors of suspended sediment delivered, often seasonally, from lakeshores. However, caldera lakes can be influenced by a broader range of physical and chemical processes that enhance or decrease fossil preservation potential. Here, we use Laguna del Hunco to provide a new perspective on paleoenvironmental controls on plant fossil preservation in tectonically active settings. We establish a refined geochronological framework for the Laguna del Hunco deposits and present a detailed history of processes active during similar to 200,000 years of lake filling from 52.217 +/- 0.014 Ma to 51.988 +/- 0.035 Ma, the time interval that encompasses nearly all fossil deposition. Detailed facies analysis shows that productive fossil localities reside within high-deposition-rate beds associated with high-energy density flows and wave-reworked lake-floor sediments, challenging traditional views that low-energy environments are required for well-preserved plant fossils. These results demonstrate that even delicate fossil components like fruits and flowers can survive high-energy transport, underscoring the importance of rapid burial as a primary control on fossil preservation. Short, steep sediment-transport networks may facilitate terrestrial fossil preservation by limiting opportunities for biochemical degradation on land and providing relatively frequent, highenergy depositional events, which quickly transport and bury organic material following events such as landslides from steep, wet, surrounding slopes. Our new model for plant taphonomy opens a path toward finding and understanding other exceptional biotas in environments once considered unlikely for preservation.

Observational records of glacier motion provide critical benchmarks to decode processes influencing glacier dynamics, but multi-decadal records that precede satellite observation and modern warming are rare. Here we present a record of motion in the ablation zone of Saskatchewan Glacier that spans seven decades. We combine in situ and remote-sensing observations to inform a first-order glacier flow model used to estimate the relative contributions of sliding and internal deformation on dynamics. We find a significant increase in basal sliding rates between melt-seasons in the 1950s and those in the 1990s and 2010s and explore three process-based explanations for this anomalous behavior: (i) the glacier surface steepened over seven decades, maintaining flow-driving stresses despite sustained thinning; (ii) the formation of a proglacial lake after 1955 may support elevated basal water pressures; and (iii) subglacial topography may cause dynamic responses specific to Saskatchewan Glacier. Although further constraints are necessary to ascertain which processes are of greatest importance for Saskatchewan Glacier's dynamic evolution, this record provides a benchmark for studies of multi-decadal glacier dynamics.

Simulating the Potential Effects of a Changing Climate on Black Spruce and Jack Pine Plantation Productivity by Site Quality and Locale through Model Adaptation	FORESTS												Modifying the stand dynamic functional determinates of structural stand density management models (SSDMMs) through the incorporation of site-specific biophysical height-age equations enabled the simulation of the effects of increasing mean temperature and precipitation during the growing season on black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plantation productivity. The analytical approach consisted of calculating future values of growing season mean temperature and precipitation rates under three emissions scenarios (no change (NC); B1; and A2), spanning three continuous commitment periods (2011-2040; 2041-2070; and 2071-2100), for three geographically separated sites throughout the central portion of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region (north-eastern (Kirkland Lake); north-central (Thunder Bay); and north-western (Dryden) Ontario, Canada), using the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3) in conjunction with a geographic-referencing climatic surface model. These estimates were entered into the embedded biophysical equations in the SSDMMs in order to forecast emission-scenario-specific developmental patterns of plantations managed under a conventional density management regime by species and site quality (poor-to-medium and good-to-excellent) at each locale; from which stand development rates and associated productivity metrics over 75 year-long rotations were estimated and compared (e.g., mean sizes, volumetric, biomass and carbon yields, end-products, economic worth, stand stability, wood quality indices, and operability status). Simulation results indicated that black spruce plantations situated on both site qualities at the north-western location and on the lower site quality at the north-eastern location were negatively affected from the predicted increased warming and rainfall as evidenced from consequential declines in stand development rates and resultant decreases in rotational mean sizes, biomass yields, recoverable end-product volumes, and economic worth (A2 > B1). Conversely, black spruce plantations situated on both site qualities at the north-central location and on the higher site quality at the north-eastern location were minimally and positively affected under the A2 and B1 scenarios, respectively. Jack pine plantations situated on both site qualities at all three locations were negatively affected as evident by the reductions in stand development rates and rotational mean sizes, biomass yields, recoverable end-product volumes, and economic worth (A2 > B1). Collectively, these response patterns suggest that stand-level productivity under a changing climate will vary by species, site quality, geographic locale, and emission scenario, potentially resulting in a landscape-level mosaic of both negative and positive productivity impacts in the case of black spruce, and mostly negative impacts in the case of jack pine. As demonstrated, modelling stand-level responses to projected increases in thermal and moisture regimes through the modification of existing stand-level forecasting models, and accounting for divergent effects due to species, site quality, and geographic locale differences, is a viable and efficient alternative approach for projecting productivity outcomes arising from anthropogenic-induced changes in growing conditions.

Waterfowl Impoundments as Sources of Nitrogen Pollution	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Hydrologically controlled moist-soil impoundment wetlands provide critical habitat for high densities of migratory bird populations. Nutrients exported from heavily used impoundments by prescribed seasonal drawdown of surface water may contribute to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. To investigate the relative importance of nutrient export from managed impoundment habitats, we conducted a field study at Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, USA, which contains 1545 ha of impoundments that drain into hypereutrophic Lake Mattamuskeet. We found that prescribed hydrologic drawdowns of an impoundment exported roughly the same amount of nitrogen (N) as adjacent fertilized agricultural fields on a per-area basis and contributed approximately one fifth of total N load to Lake Mattamuskeet. The prescribed drawdown regime, designed to maximize waterfowl production in impoundments, may be exacerbating the degradation of habitat quality in the downstream lake as an unintended consequence. Few studies of wetland N dynamics have targeted impoundments managed to provide wildlife habitat, but a similar phenomenon may occur in some of the 36,000 ha of similarly managed moist-soil impoundments on National Wildlife Refuges in the southeastern USA, especially those hosting dense concentrations of waterfowl. We suggest an earlier seasonal drawdown could potentially mitigate impoundment N pollution and estimate it could reduce N export from our study impoundment by more than 70 %.					; Richardson, Curtis/A-8202-2009	Winton, Robert/0000-0002-9048-9342; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2016	227	10							390	10.1007/s11270-016-3082-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3082-x													WOS:000385419200033

This paper considers the issue of how to achieve community engagement in regions with these characteristics. In doing so, the paper contributes to an expanding international research agenda focusing on the distinct characteristics of arid and semi-arid regions under the heading of 'dryland syndrome'. The paper draws on government liaison officer and local community perspectives of successful engagement in the case-study region of Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. The results demonstrate that widely recognised characteristics of successful engagement are required but insufficient for genuine engagement in remote dryland regions. In addition to building trust through community ownership, being inclusive, effective communication, and adequate resources, genuine community engagement in drylands also requires respecting the extreme conditions and extraordinary variability of these areas. Residents of dryland regions seek genuine engagement yet engage opportunistically when seasons are conducive and when tangible outcomes are visible.					; Robinson, Cathy/D-3349-2011; Richards, Carol/H-4347-2018; Measham, Thomas/A-5210-2010	Robinson, Cathy/0000-0002-3453-572X; Measham, Thomas/0000-0003-4549-5361; Richards, Carol/0000-0001-9887-175X; 													1745-5863	1745-5871				MAY	2011	49	2					171	182		10.1111/j.1745-5871.2011.00688.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-5871.2011.00688.x													WOS:000290172900004

Different climatic conditions and landscape positions induce different soil forming processes, leading to various soil types with specific risks and potentials. The present study portrays a soil sequence of the central section of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, from the footslopes of the eastern escarpment to the marginal volcano structures. Six profiles under natural vegetation are described for classification according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy and World Reference Base for Soil Resources classification systems, and special site characteristics are discussed. The Acacia savannah of the footslopes (1900 in a. s. 1.) is characterized by Vertisols (Mazic Vertisols/Aridic Haplusterts), with often pronounced effects of seasonal waterlogging. All other soils are well-drained and reflect the general increase in rainfall with elevation and slope, causing a decline in topsoil pH and a change from cation-rich clay soils of the Podocarpus-dominated forest at 2300 m a. s. 1. (Mollic Nitisols/Typic Palehumults) to strongly-leached Humic Urnbrisols/Humic Dystrudepts of the Hagenia-dominated forest around 2600 in a. s. 1. The highland savannah plain (2700 in a. s. 1.) with a drier and cooler environment has typically Mollic Cambisols/Dystric Haplustepts, which are less leached and have a rather brownish colour. At 2900 rn a. s. I., Niti-umbric Alisols/Andic Hapludalfs are found in the Hypericum forest at the midslopes of the marginal volcanoes receiving high rainfall, whereas soil development is at a more initial state in the Erica-dominated forest at 3200 m a. s. 1. (Umbric Andosols/Alic Hapludands). Clay mineral composition is kaolinite-dominated for the upper five profiles, with a high proportion of poorly crystalline components in the upper savannah and the volcano upslopes. The lowermost profile probably has a polygenetic origin indicated by an abrupt change from a smectitic to a kaolinitic composition in the subsoil. Soil development on quite homogeneous bedrock appears essentially controlled by relief and climate, underlining the suitability of the region as a model area for in-depth gradient studies on ecosystem processes and land use.

Understanding temporal and spatial changes of surface water levels in the watershed, and their spatial variability, is critical for restoration and protection of small ponds. A biweight spatial consistency test was employed to quantify the seasonal variability of surface water tables for 50 ponds and hydrological connectivity models, and land use metrics, topographic characteristics, and irrigation needs, for groundwater, were introduced into the model to identify influencing factors. The spatial difference of water level changes in the rice season was greater than the wheat season while water table increased in the wheat season and declined in the rice season. Continuous runoff with complete surface hydrological connectivity of ponds, which was strongly related to precipitation, occurred only one time during the study period. Water level dynamics were largely uncorrelated to surface hydrological connectivity but were linked to watershed and pond size. By evaluating irrigation water requirements, irrigation was a primary human management factor affecting the water table changes in ponds. Groundwater also enriched influence factors that estimated water level variation in ponds, and these results will provide support for improved water resource management and ponds protection purposes.					xu, jiayi/HDO-5387-2022; Wang, Cheng/AAM-1711-2021; Li, Yufeng/KLD-2943-2024	Wang, Cheng/0000-0002-1273-6184; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2020	27	31					38861	38870		10.1007/s11356-020-09959-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09959-8		JUL 2020						32632684					WOS:000545920900001

The relative importance of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities in the planktonic food web of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario 2000-2007	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The structure and function of the microbial and planktonic communities of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario were studied for 8 years from 2000 to 2007. The bay has a long history of eutrophication and has undergone remediation efforts which included reductions in phosphorus loadings and the implementation of a long term research and monitoring program (1972-present) conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada along with other federal and provincial agencies. Microbial loop research was added in 2000 to the ongoing monitoring program which included nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fish so that a comprehensive picture of food web linkages would emerge. The structure of the microbial-planktonic food web was determined based on microscopic analysis of bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton (APP), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), ciliates, phytoplankton and zooplankton and was compared to a traditional grazing food chain consisting of phytoplankton and zooplankton. On a seasonal weighted mean basis, HNF biomass (fresh weight) of 1.7-8.4 g m(-3) at Belleville and 1.1-6.3 C m(-3) at Conway exceeded that of zooplankton in virtually all observations and was often greater than the combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Furthermore, the results showed that HNF contributed upwards to 85% of the organic carbon pool on a seasonal weighted mean basis. Various parameters in the upper bay relating trophic status to autotrophic communities were measured including: point source phosphorus loadings (> 10 kg d(-1)); primary production (> 300 g C m(-2) y(-1)); chlorophyll a (> 12 mu g l(-1)) and phytoplankton biomass (> 3 g m(-3)) which indicated that the upper bay remained eutrophic. This was also confirmed by the "battery of tests" strategy of ecological indicators developed in our laboratory to assess trophic status, health, and potential Beneficial Use Impairments. Based on our observations spanning 8 years, it was concluded that the microbial food web was dominated by heterotrophic communities which are still widely ignored in Great Lakes research and monitoring efforts. Our data clearly demonstrates that future studies and management strategies should include the "microbial loop" to obtain a holistic picture of the structure, function and dynamics of the lower food web.

The transect started from the Youyi Bridge of Banma through Dari, Maqin and Maduo to Zaling Lake. The data from 47 plots along the transect are summarized and analyzed. The mean annual temperature, the mean annual rainfall and the length of growing season decreases from 2.6 to -4.5 degrees C, from 767.2 to 240.1 mm, from 210 to 140 days, respectively, along the transect from the southeastern Banma to northwestern Zaling Lake. The number of vascular plant species recorded in 47 plots is 242 including 2 tree, 34 shrub, 206 herb species. Main vegetation types on the transect from southeast to northwest are: Sabina convallium forest, Picea likiangensis forest, Pyracantha fortuneana + Spiraea alpina shrub, Hippophae neurocarpu shrub, Sibiraea angustata + Polygonum viviparum shrub, Stellera chamaejasme herb meadow, Potentilla fruticosa + Salix obscura + Carex sp.

Effect of harvesting on temporal papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) biomass regeneration potential among swamps in Winam Gulf wetlands of Lake Victoria Basin, Kenya	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study established for the first time the impact of harvesting on post-harvest papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) biomass regeneration potential, with two harvesting regimes compared. Above-ground papyrus biomass was determined. Biomass varied with site. Site had no effect on regeneration potential, but monthly harvesting reduced papyrus biomass regeneration potential among sites. However, seasonal (6-monthly) harvesting did not appear to affect papyrus biomass regeneration potential. Exponential and polynomial trend analyses revealed a consistent downward trend for monthly harvest biomass, and the polynomial trend was more linear (F = 97.913; P < 0.001) than periodic (F = 9.617; P < 0.05). The polynomial trend scenario indicated how papyrus biological dynamics are likely to behave as monthly harvests are repeated. This suggests that regeneration potential is significantly reduced with successive monthly harvest, leading to weak spatial connectivity, papyrus stand fragmentation, and increased landscape patchiness. A 6-month harvest regime can be established to regenerate more biomass between harvests than is currently the case, with positive implications for wetland conservation and carbon sequestration. Papyrus harvesters can be kept off the swamps by establishing a riparian buffer zone of agro forestry trees and shrubs which can substitute for the papyrus as it is left to mature. However, while the information presented is useful for papyrus wetland management strategies, it is recognized that the study period was too short to permit a generalized recommendation.

J	Xing, P; Kong, FX				Xing, Peng; Kong, Fanxiang			Intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental factors regulating bacterioplankton community composition in Lake Taihu, China	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												To investigate the intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental factors that may have an impact on the bacterioplankton community composition (BCC), a 1 yr observation was done at 2 study sites in Lake Taihu, a large shallow eutrophic lake in China. One site was located at the center of Meiliang Bay, the other site was near the central region of the lake. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA gene fragments was applied to analyze BCC. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was used to investigate differences among BCC. Redundancy analyses (RDA) of the gel patterns, in relation to the physical, chemical, and biological factors of the 2 sites, were performed. Differences between the samples in Meiliang Bay and the lake center were evident during all periods. Four variables (the biomass of Microcystis spp., chl a, dissolved inorganic phosphorus [DIP], and water turbidity) were most strongly correlated with the bacterioplankton DGGE patterns. Particularly, significant intra-habitat heterogeneity of the environmental factors was detected. In Meiliang Bay, seasonal variations in DIP concentration had a profound impact on the composition of bacterioplankton communities, while in the lake center, wind-induced frequent sediment resuspension was an important reason for the variations in BCC. The inherent intra-habitat heterogeneity of environmental conditions is essential to maintain the heterogeneity of BCC at the 2 study sites.					xing, peng/HDM-6843-2022	Xing, Peng/0000-0002-4917-5181													0948-3055	1616-1564				JUL 10	2007	48	2					113	122		10.3354/ame048113	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame048113													WOS:000248518700002

Age, Growth, Length-Weight Relationship and Reproduction of Chub, Squalius cephalus (L., 1758) in Upper Akcay River, Turkey	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												For the first time, we investigate the aspect of bio-ecological of chub (Squalius cephalus L., 1758) in upper Akcay River (Buyuk Menderes Basin) including the age, growth, length-weight relationship and reproduction. The study was conducted in upper Akcay River between June 2012 and May 2013. Monthly data showed that native fish chub were aboundantly with other native fish (Acanthobrama mirabilis) in upper Akcay River. The age distribution for both females and males of S. cephalus population was between I-VII, and the second age group was found at maximum rate of 30.60%. Their fork lengths and weights ranged between 6.0-22.8 cm and 3.7-134.62 g for females; 6.1-22.1 cm and 2.7-110 g for males, respectively. The growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy equation were found as Lt=34.71 {1-e(boxed times 0.116(t+0.867))] for females and Lt=32.87 [1-e(boxed times 0.127(t+0.717))] for males. The length -weight relationships were estimated to be WT=0.0269 FL2.720(R-2=0.981) for females and WT=0.0251 FL2.7535 (R-2=0.983) for males. Weight increased negatively allometrical with the fork length for both sex. The average condition factor for females was calculated as 1.37 while 1.32 for males. The sexual maturity age of females and males was determined to be II age group and first sexual maturity. The total length was found as 11.33 cm for female and 10.89 cm for male. According to the trends of GSI values, it was assumed that their season of reproductivity was between March and May.																			0030-9923					OCT	2017	49	5					1571	1580		10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.5.1571.1580	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.5.1571.1580													WOS:000416295400004

Nitrogen fixation rates in forested mountain streams: Are sediment microbes more important than previously thought?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Biological nitrogen (N) fixation, the microbial conversion of N-2 gas to ammonia, makes N available to food webs. Low-N streams often have a high relative abundance of N-fixing taxa, suggesting that N fixation is an important N source in these systems. Despite this potential, stream N fixation has not been well-characterised, particularly compared to lakes and marine environments. One unknown is the relative contributions of various N-fixing organisms, particularly heterotrophic microbes. 2. In low-N streams in the Cascade Mountains (Washington, USA), three groups of N-fixers predominate: cyanobacteria (Nostoc paramelioides) colonies that house a midge symbiont (Cricotopus spp.), cyanobacteria without a midge symbiont, and heterotrophic sediment microbes. In seven streams, we measured N fixation rates in each group with the acetylene reduction assay and a N-15(2) calibration. 3. Cyanobacteria N fixation rates were relatively low (7.9 +/- 8.9 mu g N m(-2) hr(-1), mean +/- SD) compared to other mountain streams. Although rates were comparable among types of N-fixers, our sediment conversion ratio (moles of ethylene produced:moles of N fixed) was 0.16:1, much lower than our cyanobacteria conversion ratio of 1.72:1 and the commonly used theoretical ratio of 3:1. Sediment N fixation rates (5.7 +/- 4.0 mu g N m(-2) hr(-1)) were higher than previously reported rates measured only with acetylene reduction. 4. The midge symbiosis did not greatly impact N fixation rates; however, owing to their prevalence, colonies with the midge probably contributed more total N to streams than colonies without the midge. Additionally, N fixation by sediment heterotrophs was comparable to that of cyanobacteria colonies on an areal basis. 5. Our study demonstrated that the contribution of sediment heterotrophs previously may have been underestimated in streams, especially considering that sediment heterotrophs are probably present for a longer portion of the growing season than cyanobacteria in temperate and boreal ecosystems.					; Roley, Sarah/LKJ-5021-2024	Roley, Sarah/0000-0002-6733-9338; Bakker, Erica/0000-0001-5595-079X; Vizza, Carmella/0000-0002-9269-0357													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2022	67	8					1395	1410		10.1111/fwb.13925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13925		JUN 2022											WOS:000814807900001

It regulates the hydrologic cycle over the tropical continents and interacts tightly with the tropical oceans, notably with the seasonal appearance of the equatorial cold tongues of the Atlantic and Pacific. While it undergoes a regular seasonal migration, today the ITCZ maintains a nearly permanent Northern Hemisphere bias. Here we address the question of variability in the mean latitude of the marine ITCZ over the eastern Pacific on time scales of 100-10,000 years, with emphasis on the past 30,000 years. Our strategy relies on reconstructing the intensity of the prominent oceanographic front of the cold tongue-ITCZ complex, using oxygen isotope and magnesium thermometry techniques. We show that a weaker cold tongue-ITCZ front prevailed during the last glacial maximum (LGM), which indicates a more southerly ITCZ at that time. We further show that the Holocene history of sea surface temperature (SST) near the Galapagos Islands is consistent with progressive southward migration of the ITCZ during the last similar to 7,000 years, in accord with records from South America and the tropical Atlantic. In the more recent past, evidence from eastern Pacific corals supports a northward ITCZ shift since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), in agreement with the hydrologic record of the nearby Cariaco Basin. Collectively, the evidence points to coherent behavior of the Pacific, Atlantic, and South American ITCZs over a broad range of time scales. All regions have responded to Northern Hemisphere cooling by southward (equatorward) ITCZ displacements. In the Pacific, such displacements are likely to have been unfavorable to divergent upwelling at the equator, resulting in weaker zonal and meridional SST gradients and more uniform equatorial SSTs, analogous to modem El Nino conditions.

Movements by Adfluvial Bull Trout during the Spawning Season between Lake and River Habitats	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Movements of adfluvial Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus were evaluated with acoustic telemetry during spawning seasons 2006-2011 in Chester Morse Lake,Washington. Ninety-six percent of the individuals made multiple trips between the lake and river habitat during the spawning season,which lasted from less than 1day to more than a month. Male Bull Trout took an average 13.2 (+/- 8.7 SD) trips,while females averaged 18.0 (+/- 14.0 SD) trips. Directional movement between the lake and a river occurred throughout the day; however,the distribution of movement activity was bimodal,peaking from 0600 to 0900hours (downstream movement) and from 1700 to 2000hours (upstream movement). The majority of time spent in the river per trip occurred during nighttime hours for female (mean = 74%) and male Bull Trout (mean = 72%). While spawning activity was not confirmed for each trip,this study illustrates an as-yet unreported movement pattern of adfluvial Bull Trout during the spawning season. These results are relevant to managers considering monitoring population trends by way of redd count surveys because multiple redd sites per spawning season are possible,a situation that could lead to overestimating population numbers. Additional research to determine whether spawning occurs on individual trips would help assess whether population numbers could be overestimated by simply using redd counts in systems similar to the one studied.																			0002-8487					MAY 1	2013	142	3					876	883		10.1080/00028487.2013.763858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.763858													WOS:000320642200027

An area of 594.36 km(2) (6.75%) and 4.17 km(2) (0.04%) was affected by surface waterlogging during pre and postmonsoon season, respectively. The average annual groundwater level fluctuations were calculated using 18 years (19902007) pre and postmonsoon groundwater level data to identify the areas which are under groundwater induced waterlogging conditions. The soil map clearly indicates that salinity and sodicity exhibit the highest severity and occur in areas with shallow groundwater levels. The hydrogeomorphical units mapped using IRS P6 LISS III satellite images are flood plain, alluvial plain, paleochannels, and oxbow lakes. The study revealed that 44.65% areas have very good to excellent groundwater resources. The litholog data clearly indicate an alternating sequence of clay and sand in which deep aquifers made up of coarse sand would be best suited for adequate water supply and good groundwater quality. The integrated study utilizing digital spatial data pertaining to waterlogging, soil salinity, water level fluctuation, and lithological variation proved that planning of any surface and subsurface water resources development activity should be taken up after assessments of said parameters.

The results show that tropical seasonal rainforest (and mountain rainforest), south subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, and Quercus shrub are distinguished effectively from other vegetation types by analysis of surface pollen. The south subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, Pinus kesiya forest and evergreen broadleaf forest are distinguished effectively from other types of vegetation by pollen analysis. However, P. yunnanensis forest is not distinguished from other vegetation types, and P. armandii, P. densata forest and temperate deciduous conifer mixed forest are not distinguished. The over-representation of Pinus pollen is the main reason that these vegetation communities are not distinguished from each other. Conifer stomata analysis is an effective tool for identifying and distinguishing different types of coniferous forest, and this method performs well even with a small number of sampling points.					; Li, Chenzhong/F-5087-2016	Li, Chunhai/0000-0002-6529-6653; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				MAY	2013	58	15					1775	1786		10.1007/s11434-012-5657-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5657-2													WOS:000319530900009

Three different types of temporary wet habitats were monitored throughout the growing season: large temporary ponds (lTPs), small temporary ponds (sTPs), and rock pools (RPs). lTPs presented a small-scale zonation arranged in an inner, an intermediate, and a peripheral belt. A total of 98 species were recorded, of which 40 were classified as temporary wet habitat (TWH) specialists and 24 as rare. Eight different groups of plant assemblages were identified presenting space-time dynamics related to water-depth variations and flooding period. In terms of diversity, the most relevant assemblages were located in the outer belt of the lTPs and in the sTPs. The mosaic of different assemblages and their time-variability determined the presence of several types of habitats of community interest according to the Habitat Directive. This wide heterogeneity should be taken into account to ensure that all types of TWHs are considered in conservation programmes.

Occupational Injury and Treatment Patterns of Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers	JOURNAL OF AGROMEDICINE												Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are thought to be at increased risk for occupational injury and illness. Past surveillance efforts that employed medical chart review may not be representative of all farmworkers, since the proportion of farmworkers using migrant health centers (MHCs) and area hospital emergency rooms (ERs) was unknown. The purpose of the current study was to determine the proportion of workers using MHCs versus other sources of occupational health care, and to use these data to correct previous occupational injury and illness rate estimates. Researchers conducted a survey of migrant and seasonal farmworkers in two sites: the Finger Lakes Region of New York and the apple, broccoli, and blueberry regions of Maine. Researchers also conducted MHC and ER medical chart reviews in these regions for comparison purposes. Proportions of occupational morbidity by treatment location were calculated from the survey, and a correction factor was computed to adjust chart review morbidity estimates for Maine and New York State. Among 1103 subjects, 56 work-related injuries were reported: 30 (53.6%) were treated at a MHC, 8 (14.3%) at an ER, 9 (16.1%) at some other location (e. g., home, relative, chiropractor), and 9 (16.1%) were untreated. Mechanisms of injuries treated at MHCs versus all other sources did not differ significantly. The survey-based multiplier (1.87) was applied to previous statewide MHC chart review injury counts from Maine and New York. The corrected injury rates were 7.9 per 100 full-time equivalents (FTE) per year in Maine, and 11.7 per 100 FTE in New York. A chart-review based surveillance system, combined with a correction factor, may provide an effective method of estimating occupational illness and injury rates in this population.																			1059-924X	1545-0813					2009	14	2			SI		172	178		10.1080/10599240902799715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10599240902799715								19437274					WOS:000208222400014

Monitoring transparency in inland water bodies using multispectral images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The aim of this research was to monitor transparency in inland water bodies from water reflectance field measurements and also from high and medium spatial resolution sensors. The most suitable band to measure transparency was determined by sampling irradiance, water reflectance and transparency at different depths. The results of this sampling show that the wavelength range 520-600nm is the most suitable band for measuring transparency. Reflectance in this band was regressed against transparency field data to derive an empirical equation for transparency estimation. This equation was assessed using data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1992 and Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) data from 1997. The difference in the errors in the data observed between the two dates was attributed to the fact that in 1997 the sampling time was less than 3h (1.5h before and after the acquisition of the image), which allowed similar solar illumination conditions to be maintained, while in 1992 the sampling time was much longer. Once the equation was verified, water transparency monitoring was performed for a set of satellite images obtained from 1984 to 2000. The maps show that transparency in the water bodies responds to seasonal trends. Furthermore, this analysis enabled trophic state and Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) transparency maps to be generated, which are very useful for the management of water bodies.					; Chuvieco, Emilio/N-6448-2016; Sastre-Merlín, Antonio/AAA-5334-2019	Dominguez-Gomez, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-1873-1173; Chuvieco, Emilio/0000-0001-5618-4759; Sastre-Merlin, Antonio/0000-0003-1386-9015													0143-1161	1366-5901					2009	30	6					1567	1586	PII 910649662	10.1080/01431160802513811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160802513811													WOS:000265415600012
J	Parker-Stetter, SL; Horne, JK				Parker-Stetter, Sandra L.; Horne, John K.			Nekton distribution and midwater hypoxia: A seasonal, diel prey refuge?	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Hypoxia affects the distribution of pelagic nekton (i.e., fish and large invertebrates) in both marine and freshwater systems. Bottom hypoxia is common, but midwater oxygen minimum layers (OMLs) also develop in marine offshore regions, fjords, and freshwater lakes. Studies of nekton responses to OML in marine ecosystems have primarily occurred in deep, offshore regions with thick, persistent OMLs. Our study examined the response of pelagic nekton to an OML in a shallow temperate fjord, Hood Canal, WA, U.S.A. Using acoustics, we quantified vertical distribution of nekton at two sites (Hoodsport and Duckabush) before (July) and after (September) OML development. Both Hoodsport and Duckabush had strong OML between 10 and 35 m in September, with lower (minimum 0.63 mg L-1) oxygen levels at Hoodsport compared to Duckabush (1.58 mg L-1). The OML did not affect daytime distribution of fish or invertebrates, with both occupying depths >60 m. At night in July, with no OML, invertebrates migrated into waters <20 m and fish dispersed to within 15 m of the surface at both sites. in the presence of the September OML, invertebrates migrated into waters <20 m, but the upper limit of fish vertical distribution stopped at the base of the OML (35 m) at Hoodsport. Fish vertical distribution at Duckabush was less pronounced within and above the OML (10-35 m) than it had been in July. Our results suggest that the OML did not affect invertebrate vertical distribution, but did affect fish vertical migration, and may provide a seasonal, diel prey refuge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Delivery of Trace Metals (Al, Fe, Mn, V, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, Ag, Pb) from the Trinity River Watershed Towards the Ocean	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The Trinity River (Texas, USA) contains in its watershed 23 different reservoir lakes, the largest one being Lake Livingston situated in the lower Trinity River watershed and two potentially polluting metroplexes, Dallas and Houston. In order to determine fluxes of nutrients and trace metals to Galveston Bay, a survey that included 24 discreet samples collected over a year and at various stages of discharge was carried out during 2000-2001. Geochemical (i.e., sorption by Fe oxyhydroxides), biological (i.e., seasonal uptake by sinking algae in Lake Livingston), and hydrological (i.e., dilution effects by increasing flow rates) controls were found to be mainly responsible for variations in dissolved trace metal concentrations rather than pollution sources. The Trinity River loads of suspended sediments and pollutant trace metals entering Galveston Bay at Anahuac were < 20% of those reaching Lake Livingston, and only a few percent of the total upstream trace metal load is entering the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, during the transit through the 23 man-made lakes and an estuary, > 96% of the pollutant trace metal load is lost to sediments.

J	Wantzen, KM; Machado, FD; Voss, M; Boriss, H; Junk, WJ				Wantzen, KM; Machado, FD; Voss, M; Boriss, H; Junk, WJ			Seasonal isotopic shifts in fish of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Seasonal inundations shape the floodplain characteristics of the Pantanal, a large wetland in Central South America. In the first study combining stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis with classical stomach content analysis in this region, we investigated the influence of the annual inundation on diet and isotopic composition of floodplain fish. Apart from potential food items, 33 fish species from the Coqueiro Lake were analyzed, 10 of which were present during both the wet and dry season 1999. A delta(13)C and delta(15)N plot of the floodplain ecosystem allowed us to assess a foodchain of 3-4 trophic levels. However, the wide overlap of nitrogen values suggested that the organisms act on-trophic continua rather than on distinct levels. The foodweb was based mainly on C-3-plant carbon. However, fish species capable of feeding on terrestrial invertebrates (e.g., Brycon microlepis) had delta(13)C values above -25parts per thousand, indicating 13-30% intake of C-4-plant based carbon during the flooding period. The novel use of vector coordinates and 2-dimensional ANOVA showed that the seasonal isotopic shifts of delta(13)C and 51 IN were highly significant for some feeding guilds. delta(15)N values increased from the wet to dry season in most fish species, and these shifts were highly significant for omnivores (Astyanax bimaculatus, Triportheus nematurus, Tetragonopterus argenteus and Moenkhausia dichroura), and significant for invertivores (Gymnogeophagus balzanii and Poptella paraguayensis) and carnivores (Serrasalmus spilopleura). Average carbon isotope ratios decreased at the same time in the herbivores (Methynnis mola: 3.4parts per thousand) and detritivores (Psectrogaster curviventris: 5.3parts per thousand), but they did not change in the hypostomatic herbivore Sturisoma robustum. We explain these shifts by abundant and variable food sources during the inundation period and increasing carnivory and starvation during the dry season when the lake is confined to its central basin. Isotopic shifts between seasons were more prominent in less specialized species of omnivores, invertivores and some carnivores, whereas more specialized herbivores and detritivores appeared to be more influenced by changes in the carbon isotope ratio of the diet affected by biogeochemical processes such as respiration and methanogenesis. A general model for the interpretation of isotope data of floodplain fish considering different time-scales is given.					; Junk, Wolfgang/A-6172-2017; Wantzen, Karl/A-5954-2015; Wantzen, Karl M./A-5954-2015	Voss, Maren/0000-0002-5827-9062; Wantzen, Karl M./0000-0002-2192-1883													1015-1621	1420-9055					2002	64	3					239	251		10.1007/PL00013196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00013196													WOS:000179471200002
J	Gillette, D; Ono, D; Richmond, K				Gillette, D; Ono, D; Richmond, K			A combined modeling and measurement technique for estimating windblown dust emissions at Owens (dry) Lake, California - art. no. F01003	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The problem of dust emissions from playa sources is an important one both in terms of human health and in terms of global dust issues, distribution of loess, and mineral cycling. A refined method of modeling atmospheric dust concentrations due to wind erosion was developed using real-time saltation flux measurements and ambient dust monitoring data at Owens Lake, California. This modeling method may have practical applications for modeling the atmospheric effects of wind erosion in other areas. Windblown dust from the Owens Lake bed often causes violations of federal air quality standards for particulate matter (PM10) that are the highest levels measured in the United States. The goal of this study was to locate dust source areas on the exposed lake bed, estimate their PM10 emissions, and use air pollution modeling techniques to determine which areas caused or contributed to air quality violations. Previous research indicates that the vertical flux of PM10 (F-a) is generally proportional to the total horizontal saltation flux (q) for a given soil texture and surface condition. For this study, hourly PM10 emissions were estimated using F-a = K' x m(15), where m(15) is the measured sand flux at 15 cm above the surface, and K' was derived empirically by comparing air quality model predictions to monitored PM10 concentrations. Hourly sand flux was measured at 135 sites (1 km spacing) on the lake bed, and PM10 was monitored at six off-lake sites for a 30 month period. K' was found to change spatially and temporally over the sampling period. These changes appeared to be linked to different soil textures and to seasonal surface changes. K' values compared favorably with other F-a/q values measured at Owens Lake using portable wind tunnel and micrometeorological methods. Hourly trends for the model-predicted PM10 concentrations agreed well with monitored PM10 concentrations. Dust production was estimated at 7.2 x 10(4) t of PM10 for a 12 month period. A single storm accounted for 9% of the annual dust emissions at 6.5 x 10(3) t. The modeling results were used to identify 77 km(2) of dust-producing areas on the lake bed that will be controlled to attain the federal air quality standard for PM10.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				JAN 17	2004	109	F1							F01003	10.1029/2003JF000025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JF000025													WOS:000224567000002

Influence of Eutrophication on the Distribution of Total Mercury and Methylmercury in Hydroelectric Reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The distribution of mercury (Hg) and the characteristics of its methylation were investigated in Wujiangdu (WJD) and Yinzidu (YZD) reservoirs in Guizhou province, China. The two reservoirs are characterized by high and low levels of primary productivity, respectively. Mercury species in water samples from depth profiles in both reservoirs and from interface water in the WJD were analyzed each season during 2007. The concentrations of total Hg (HgTunf) and methylmercury (MeHgTunf) in unfiltered water samples from the WJD varied from 3.0 to 18 pmol dm(-3) and from 0.17 to 15 pmol dm(-3), respectively; ranges were 2.0 to 9.5 pmol dm(-3) for HgTunf and 0.14 to 2.2 pmol dm(-3) for MeHgTunf in the YZD. Elevated methylmercury concentrations in water samples from the bottom water and water sediment interface demonstrated an active net Hg methylation in the downstream reach of the WJD. There was no discernable Hg methylation occurring in the YZD, nor in the upstream and middle reaches of the WJD. The results suggest that high primary productivity resulting from cage aquaculture activities in the WJD is an important control on Hg methylation in the reservoir, increasing the concentrations of MeHg in water in the Wujiang River basin, southwestern China.

J	Lauridsen, TL; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E; Sondergaard, M				Lauridsen, TL; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E; Sondergaard, M			Response of submerged macrophytes in Danish lakes to nutrient loading reductions and biomanipulation	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				During the last two decades the nutrient loading to Danish lakes has been reduced with the aim to improve water quality. However, because of internal P-loading and biological resistance, the expected improvement has been delayed. Therefore, to reduce the duration of the recovery period and to accelerate recolonisation of submerged macrophytes, several lakes have been biomanipulated with the purpose of improving the top-down control by zooplankton. To elucidate the effects of these measures, we undertook an analysis of data on submerged macrophytes monitored annually in 17 lakes for 8 years. The results obtained show that the macrophyte coverage in non-biomanipulated lakes remained relatively stable following the external nutrient reduction. However, a small increase in macrophyte coverage occurred in a few lakes. In two of the four biomanipulated lakes, in contrast, macrophyte coverage increased from 0 up to 80% within 2-4 years following manipulation. In the other two lakes macrophyte colonisation failed. However, in lakes with a successful recolonisation, large inter-annual variations in macrophyte coverage, varying between 2 and 80% among growth seasons, occurred. We conclude that the potential of macrophyte recolonisation after nutrient loading reduction on the short term is higher in biomanipulated lakes than in lakes subjected to loading reduction only, although biomanipulation does not provide a guarantee for macrophyte recolonisation or a stable macrophyte community when colonisation occurs.

J	Beer, J; Mende, W; Stellmacher, R				Beer, J; Mende, W; Stellmacher, R			The role of the sun in climate forcing	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					1st PAGES Open Science Meeting	APR 19-23, 1998	UNIV LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND		UNIV LONDON			The Sun is by far the most important driving force of the climate system. However, only little is known how variable this force is acting on different time scales ranging from minutes to millennia and how the climate system reacts to changes in this forcing. Changes of the global insolation can be related to the nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun, the energy transport through the radiative zone and the convection zone, the emission of radiation from the photosphere, and the distance between Sun and Earth. Satellite based measurements over two decades show a clear correlation between the solar irradiance and the Ii-year sunspot cycle. The irradiance amplitude is about 0.1%. This is too small to affect significantly the climate. However, there are indications that, on longer time scales, solar variability coluld be much larger. The analysis of cosmogenic nuclides stored in natural archives provides a means to extend our knowledge of solar variability over much longer time periods. The response of the climate system to solar forcing depends not only on the amount of radiation, but also on its spectral composition (e.g. UV contribution), seasonal distribution over the globe, and feedback mechanisms connected with clouds, water vapour, ice cover, atmospheric and oceanic transport and other terrestrial processes. It is therefore difficult to establish a quantitative relationship between observed climate changes in the past and reconstructed solar variability. However, there is growing evidence that periods of low solar activity (so called minima) coincide with advances of glaciers, changes in lake levels, and sudden changes of climatic conditions. These findings point to an active role of the Sun in past climate changes beside other geophysical factors, internal variability of the climate system, and greenhouse gases. In fact a non-linear regression model to separate natural and anthropogenic forcing since 1850 is consistent with a solar contribution of about 40% to the global warming during the last 140 years.

Dominant species and species diversity indices were determined and Q(B/T) was used to assess water quality. The annual average density and biomass of the rotifers in Yangcheng Lake was 2 894 +/- 1 006 ind./L and 12.47 +/- 10.28 mg/L, respectively. The highest densities were observed in the western portion of the lake in March, but the highest biomass occurred in inflowing creeks in September. Within a year of monitoring in Yangcheng Lake, 93 species were identified and the dominant species were found to be Polyarthra trigla, Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis, Keratella valga, Brachionus calyciflorus, and Filinia major. Of the species recorded, 75 were pollution indicator species. Density and biomass exhibited significant positive correlations with water temperature (R = 0.209, P = 0.003; R = 0.446, P = 0.000), but the peak density showed two lags in response to chl a. According to the Jaccard similarity index (S-J), the greatest similarity among dominant species occurred between creeks and the eastern part of the lake. The annual average Shannon-Wiener diversity index H', Margalef richness index D and Pielou evenness index J were 1.96 +/- 0.34, 1.61 +/- 0.50 and 0.77 +/- 0.10, respectively. In all four areas of Yangcheng Lake, beta- mesosaprobic species comprised the largest share of pollution indicator species. These data suggest that Yangcheng Lake is mesosaprobic.

This study elucidated the diversity and composition of T4-type phages by analyzing partial major capsid gene (g23) sequences in DNA extracts from five paddy field soils in Northeast China during the flooded period of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. In total, 106 different g23 clones were obtained, among which 88 clones were grouped into Paddy Groups I, III, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX, and the remaining 18 clones were left ungrouped, suggesting the high diversity of g23 clones in paddy field soils in Northeast China. In addition, the distribution of g23 sequences in this study was distinctly different from those in marine and lake freshwater environments. UniFrac analysis of g23 clone assemblages from different environments demonstrated that T4-type phage community compositions varied among marine, lake, paddy field soil and upland soil environments.

Here, we test for direct and indirect climatic drivers on competitive impact of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) on brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) along a climate gradient in central Scandinavia, spanning from coastal to high-alpine environments. As a measure of competitive impact, trout food consumption was measured using Cs-137 tracer methodology both during the ice-covered and ice-free periods, and contrasted between lakes with or without char coexistence along the climate gradient. Variation in food consumption between lakes was best described by a linear mixed effect model including a three-way interaction between the presence/absence of Arctic char, season and Secchi depth. The latter is proxy for terrestrial dissolved organic carbon run-off, strongly governed by climatic properties of the catchment. The presence of Arctic char had a negative impact on trout food consumption. However, this effect was stronger during ice-cover and in lakes receiving high carbon load from the catchment, whereas no effect of water temperature was evident. In conclusion, the length of the ice-covered period and the export of allochthonous material from the catchment are likely major, but contrasting, climatic drivers of the competitive interaction between two freshwater lake top predators. While future climatic scenarios predict shorter ice-cover duration, they also predict increased carbon run-off. The present study therefore emphasizes the complexity of cascading ecosystem effects in future effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.

In the present work, the air-water exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was studied using passive air samplers at an urban lake, which receives the effluents from a MSTP in Beijing, China. The concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs in atmosphere were in the range 15.5-108 ng sample(-1) and 2.37-27.8 ng sample(-1), respectively, during the sampling period (August, 2007-July, 2008). The predominant PCBs and PBDEs were lowly halogenated congeners. The calculation for the exchange fluxes of PCBs and PBDEs using fugacity model showed that, the net exchange fluxes in different seasons were closely related to the halogen number of different congeners. Except for CBs-28 and 52, the net exchange fluxes was mainly directed from air to water for most of predominant congeners, which implied that the lower chlorinated CBs were dominated by volatilization process rather than the dry/wet depositions and diffusion between air-water interface, additionally, for heavy congeners, the dry/wet deposition process was an important source of PCBs and PBDEs in this lake.

Estimates of marginal willingness to pay for catching fish based on annual data are 5 times higher than those based on bimonthly data. Likewise, the estimated welfare gain from a 1 m increase in water clarity is 1.5 times higher in models using annual data. We find that within-season variability in recreational site attributes can have a statistically significant effect on welfare estimates. The effect of seasonal variation in site attributes has rarely been accounted for in travel cost random utility models of recreation. We conclude that appropriate treatment of temporal variability can assist environmental managers to design more cost-effective policies based on improved estimates of welfare gains.

Bird surveys conducted on 21 wetland areas detected 8,311 individuals belonging to 27 species from 9 families. The most abundant and frequent species were Ashy-headed Goose (Chloephaga poliocephala), Speckled Teal (Anas flavirostris), Red-gartered Coot (Fulica armillata) and White-winged Coot (Fulica leucoptera). The presence and abundance of bird species with respect to wetland surface area was examined. Small lakes (< 100 ha) had higher numbers of individuals, but some species such as the Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax olivaceus), Great Grebe (Podiceps major), Flying Steamer Duck (Tachyeres patachonicus) and Spectacled Duck (Anas specularis) were more abundant at larger lakes. Speckled Teal, Red Shoveler (Anas platalea) and Chiloe Wigeon (A. sibilatrix) were more common in small- and medium-sized lakes. Most waterbird species were found at a smaller percentage of the lakes where mink were present than at mink-free lakes. Although the ponds and lakes studied are protected within the network of this Argentine National Park, such protection is not implemented effectively. Hence, their future conservation faces several potential threats such as American mink expansion, tourism, fishing and hunting. This information could contribute to the development of management guidelines for the effective conservation of Patagonian wetlands.

Impact of West Nile virus and other mortality factors on American white pelicans at breeding colonies in the northern plains of North America	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are colonial-nesting birds and their breeding sites are concentrated in a few small areas, making this species especially vulnerable to factors that can influence productivity, such as disease, disturbance, predation, weather events and loss of nesting habitat. Nearly half of the American white pelican population breeds at four colonies in the northern plains: Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in North Dakota, Bitter Lake (Waubay NWR) in South Dakota, Medicine Lake NWR in Montana, and Marsh Lake in Minnesota. Thus, sustained productivity at these colonies is crucial to the health of the entire species. During the latter half of the 2002 and 2003 breeding seasons, unusually high mortality of pelican chicks was observed at these colonies. West Nile virus (WNv) was identified as one source of these losses. In 2004-2007 we monitored three major colonies in the northern plains to assess mortality of chicks during the late breeding season. We documented severe weather events, disturbance, and WNv as factors contributing to chick mortality. Before WNv arrived in the region in 2002, chick mortality after mid-July was <= 4%, and then jumped to as high as 44% in the years since WNv arrived. WNv kills older chicks that are no longer vulnerable to other common mortality factors (e.g., severe weather, gull predation) and typically would have survived to fledge; thus WNv appears to be an additive mortality factor. Persistence of lower productivity at American white pelican colonies in the northern plains might reduce the adult breeding population of this species in the region.

We studied the kinetics of ELFA precipitation in freshwater samples at levels of total plankton and single phytoplankton cells, and tested the suitability of ELFP for measurement of surface-bound algal extracellular phosphatases. Samples from acidic Plesne Lake (pH similar to 5; high phosphatase activity) and eutrophic Rimov reservoir (pH similar to7-10; moderate phosphatase activity) were incubated with ELFP for 5-300 min, fixed with HgCl2 and filtered through polycarbonate filters. Relative fluorescence of filter-retained ELFA precipitates was quantified with image analysis. Time-courses of ELFA formation exhibited lag periods followed by finite periods of linear increase. In Plesne Lake, lag-times were shorter (1-18 min) and rates of increase in ELFA fluorescence higher (by similar to2 orders of magnitude) than in Rimov reservoir (lag-times 30-200 min). Similar patterns of ELFA formation kinetics were also observed in Plesne Lake samples in cuvette spectrofluorometer measurements (which failed in Rimov reservoir). Linear regression of seasonal data on rates of increase in ELFA fluorescence from image cytometry and spectrofluorometry (r (2) = 0.65, n = 10) allowed for calibration of image cytometry in terms of amount of cell-associated ELFA. Preliminary measurements of extracellular phosphatase activities of several algae resulted in rates (10-2260 fmol cell(-1) h(-1) ) which are comparable to data reported in the literature for algal cultures.

J	Marko, MD; White, JC				Marko, Michelle D.; White, Jason C.			Direct Comparison of Herbicidal or Biological Treatment on Myriophyllum spicatum Control and Biochemistry	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Myriophyllum spicatum or Eurasian watermilfoil (hereafter, milfoil) is among the most problematic invasive aquatic plant species throughout much of North America. M. spicatum infestations can result in reduced diversity and abundance of native plant populations. Control of the invader is essential to promoting healthy ecosystems. Several treatment alternatives are available for milfoil control, although cost and efficacy vary significantly, with some treatments resulting in more harm to the native population than no treatment at all. A series of field-based microcosms containing actively growing milfoil were constructed in order to directly compare the impact of two herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and fluridone) and the milfoil weevil (Euhrychiopsis lecontei) on weed control and plant biochemistry. Herbicide concentrations in water, plants, and sediments were monitored, as were weevil population dynamics and resulting invertebrate damage to milfoil stems. The impact of the different treatments on levels of polyphenols, carbohydrates, ash, and overall carbon and nitrogen levels in the milfoil were determined. Total biomass of the untreated milfoil increased by more than 2.7-fold during the 53-day experimental period. Conversely, the biomass of milfoil subjected to chemical or biological treatment either remained constant or decreased significantly during the experiment. The herbicide 2,4-D resulted in nearly 100% milfoil mortality by day 20, whereas fluridone toxicity was significantly slower but reached 75% by the end of the trial. Similarly, milfoil growth in the weevil-amended tanks was somewhat erratic but by the end of the trial, the total plant biomass was 71% less than that of un-amended controls. Although the total biomass remaining at the end of the fluridone and weevil treatments was similar, the carbohydrate and starch content of the shoots in the insect treatment were nearly 4.6- and 4.8-fold greater, respectively, than that of the herbicide treated plants. The higher starch content in insect-treated plants could lead to increased autofragmentation and spread of M. spicatum. However, herbicide treatments are frequently required for several years. Therefore, integrated pest management, which combines the long-term benefits of biological controls with the short-term benefits of herbicides may provide the best solution to the control of M. spicatum and the conservation of native plants.

The objectives of this study were to determine bioaccumulation of Hg in fish and to evaluate the potential impacts of Hg in the diet of aquatic birds, particularly the American white pelican (AWPE), in Lake Chapala. Hg concentrations in three fish species ranged from 0.021 to 0.568 mu g/g wet weight. Mercury in fish was positively and significantly correlated with total fish length (R-2 = 0.44, P < 0.05). The delta N-15 values in fish were significantly correlated with Hg concentrations in Chapala and the San Antonio Reservoir (R-2 = 0.69, P < 0.001 and R-2 = 0.40, P < 0.001, respectively). However, Hg concentrations in bird feathers were not significantly different between years, among locations, or among species. Hg concentrations in fish from Lake Chapala were within values reported in many parts of the world. The Hg (mean range of 2.75 to 4.54 mu g/g dw) and delta D (mean range of -62 parts per thousand to -11 parts per thousand) values in bird feathers suggested a wide pattern of exposure for highly migratory AWPE and egrets, although birds with lower delta D values in feathers appeared to have greater concentrations of Hg than those with higher delta D values. Contaminant exposure in aquatic birds in Chapala during the breeding season should be monitored next to better determine the potential effects of Hg on resident aquatic birds.

Siti			Spawning seasons of Rasbora tawarensis (Pisces: Cyprinidae) in Lake Laut Tawar, Aceh Province, Indonesia	REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY												Background: Rasbora tawarensis is an endemic freshwater fish in Lake Laut Tawar, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Unfortunately, its status is regarded as critical endangered with populations decreasing in recent years. To date no information on the spawning activities of the fish are available. Therefore, this study provides a contribution to the knowledge on reproductive biology of R. tawarensis especially on spawning seasons as well as basic information for conservation of the species. Methods: Monthly sampling was conducted from April 2008 to March 2009 by using selective gillnets. The gonadosomatic index, size composition and sex ratio were assessed. The gonadal development was evaluated based on macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the gonads. Results: The gonadosomatic index (GSI) varied between 6.65 to 18.16 in female and 4.94 to 8.56 for male. GSI of the female R. tawarensis was higher in March, September and December indicating the onset of reproductive seasons, the GSI and oocyte size being directly correlated with gonadal development stages. Although, a greater proportion of mature male than female was detected during the study, the sex ratio showed that the overall number of female was higher than male. The ovaries had multiple oocyte size classes at every stage of gonadal development, thus R. tawarensis can be classified as a group synchronous spawner or a fractional multiple spawner. Conclusion: The spawning seasons of R. tawarensis were three times a year and September being the peak of the reproductive season and the female was the predominant sex. This species is classified as a group synchronous spawner.

The pools were geographically distributed over three clusters and their hydroperiod varied from seven to more than 18 weeks. Biweekly to monthly monitoring started two weeks after inundation (March) and lasted until most pools were dry again (July). Throughout the season, nutrient concentrations and conductivity increased in all study pools. Algal biomass increased after short hydroperiod pools were already dry, resulting in an increase in the amount of suspended solids and turbidity in pools with a relatively long hydroperiod. Both the longer inundation period and conditions later in the season may have contributed to the stronger algal growth in these pools. Oxygen was not depleted towards the end of the season, potentially due to growing algae and vegetation. The high buffering capacity of the water may have contributed to the near constant pH levels through time. Pools in one of the clusters were typically more turbid, less vegetated, and had higher amounts of suspended matter when compared to pools in the two other clusters. Temporary pool characteristics were related to local environmental conditions and seasonal dynamics differed according to the duration of inundation.					; Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; 													0277-5212					JUN	2008	28	2					401	410		10.1672/06-174.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/06-174.1													WOS:000256445900012

Furthermore, season and lake morphology appear to influence the importance of methane as a carbon source. However, rarely have the dynamics of the methane cycle been measured concurrently with the isotope signatures of chironomid larvae. We examined the methane dynamics in 2 lakes with contrasting mixing regimes (polymictic and dimictic), while monitoring corresponding changes in chironomid larval delta C-13 throughout an annual cycle. Both methane turnover rates and abundance of methane-oxidising bacteria were higher in the dimictic lake, where correspondingly lower mean larval delta C-13 values of -44.2 to -61.7 parts per thousand. were recorded. In contrast, potential methane production and oxidation rates, as well as cell numbers of methane-oxidising bacteria were always lower in the polymictic lake; corresponding larval delta C-13 values ranged from -32.3 to -29.6 parts per thousand.. Furthermore, seasonal variation in larval delta C-13 was more pronounced in the dimictic lake (-50.1 +/- 5.9 parts per thousand) compared to the polymictic lake (-31.1 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand), reflecting the amplitude of turnover rates. This suggests strongly that lake characteristics have an influence on methane turnover rates and, in conjunction with season, affect the subsequent incorporation of methane-derived carbon into freshwater food webs via macroinvertebrates.

We compared the taxonomic composition and spatial patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in sediments of littoral areas in a reservoir with >30 y of seasonal drawdowns (Sooke Lake Reservoir [SLR]) and a natural lake with little seasonal change in water levels (Shawnigan Lake [SHL]). Contrary to our predictions, macroinvertebrate density and biomass usually were greater in SLR than in SHL. In SLR, densities and biomasses of macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids, were higher below the drawdown exposure zone than in the upper littoral area. Chironomids with r-selected survival strategies (i.e., smaller size) or desiccant-resistant stages appeared well suited to the fluctuating environment of littoral zones in reservoirs. Orthocladiinae, Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and Tanypodinae dominated at sampling sites immediately below the drawdown exposure zone in SLR, whereas only Orthocladiinae dominated at deeper sites. Warm water from an expanded epilimnion apparently extended the distribution of Diamesinae farther from shore in SLR than in SHL. Chironomini generally were the dominant macroinvertebrate taxon in SHL, and the relative biomass of Diamesinae increased with depth. Distributions of oligochaetes and nematodes extended farther from shore in SLR than in SHL. These contrasting benthic macroinvertebrate communities indicate that variable drawdown regimes could have significant impacts on benthic food webs and the transfer of energy and nutrients to the pelagic area.

Physicochemical gradients and water fluxes between Nyanza Gulf and main Lake Victoria, East Africa: Tracing dynamics of gulf-main lake interaction	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					Variability in physico-chemical water column structure along a gradient between Nyanza Gulf and Lake Victoria was characterized, and the exchange between the two basins estimated. Specific conductivity (SC) measurements between March 2005 and March 2006 identified three morphologically distinct zones, the inner-gulf, the connecting Rusinga Channel and the main lake basin. The relatively shallow, wide and river-influenced inner-gulf had higher turbidity and SC compared to the channel and the main lake. The deep, narrow and more wind-exposed mid-channel area was significantly cooler than the rest of the study areas. Observational data revealed "density-driven" underflow of the cooler channel water into the main lake and compensatory surface flow into the gulf as well as seasonal patterns of gulf-main lake exchange in relation to variation in tributary input. The wind field was dominated by a diurnal lake-land breeze which resulted in wind-driven diurnal reversal of water flow in and out of the gulf, where the constriction of flow within the channel induced strong currents. The exchange between the gulf and the main lake was estimated using a box model, with SC as a conservative tracer. A net annual residual water flow of 35 m(3) s(-1) occurred from the gulf into the main lake although during months with low tributary discharge the flow was towards the gulf. The daily flow in and out of the gulf resulted in relatively high exchange flux compared to residual flow across the Rusinga Channel leading to the development of the well-defined physicochemical gradient along the Rusinga Channel.

The study determined seasonal environmental changes in Lake Volta and its implications on cage production of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus in experimental and commercial farm (Sun Woo Farm) set-ups. For each set-up, three cages were used, each measuring 81 and 162.5 m(3) for experimental and commercial, respectively. The cages were stocked with 22.5 g fingerlings at a rate of 40 and 80 m(-3) in experimental and commercial cages, respectively, and fed commercial diet. The growth performance, yield, economics, and selected water quality parameters were monitored during the dry and wet seasons between November 2014 and July 2015. There were no differences in water quality parameters between dry and wet seasons (p > 0.05). Water quality for both seasons remained within limits required for good Tilapia growth in both set-ups. There were minimal variations in growth characteristics between seasons which were not significant; however, final mean weight and yields were high in the dry seasons in both set-ups. The cost of feed and fingerling accounting for about 80% of total costs were the major components identified to affect cost of production. A higher profit index and returns on investment were observed in the dry season in both set-ups and was linked to higher survival rates in the season. Production of Nile tilapia in cages can be cultured throughout the year without any adverse effects as exhibited in similar production patterns in both experimental and commercial set-ups.

J	Thakar, MK; Luthra, D; Khattar, JS				Thakar, Mukesh Kumar; Luthra, Deepali; Khattar, Jasvirinder Singh			Forensic studies of phytoplankton ecology of two water bodies of Kurukshetra area of Haryana, State in India	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES												Background: In forensic investigations of death cases in which the body has been recovered from a water body, there is an urgent need to prove whether the death is due to drowning or not. Moreover, another important issue arises, whether a person was alive at the time of drowning (anti-mortem drowning) or he was thrown dead into the water body (post-mortem drowning) To answer these questions, phytoplankton species of forensic importance from two water bodies (Braham Sarovar and Prithus Pools) were analyzed to develop the Phytoplankton maps (P-maps). The P-maps are basically a detailed list of categories of species which are common, site-specific, rare and seasonally occurring phytoplanktons along with their photomicrographs. Methods: In the present study, water samples have been collected from Braham Sarovar and Prithus Pools situated at Kurukshetra area of Haryana state, India. The phytoplankton species present in both ponds were extracted by mild acid digestion (5% HCl). The physico-chemical properties of these water bodies such as pH, water temperature, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, hardness, alkalinity, calcium, sodium, potassium, and chloride ions have been recorded to establish a correlation with the distribution of phytoplankton using principal component analysis. Results: Total 138 species of 59 genera of phytoplanktons belonging to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae have been observed. In Braham Sarovar, Cylindrospermum sp., Epithemia turgida, Eunotia rhomboidea, and Westella botryoides were the site-specific phytoplanktons whereas in Prithus pool, the site specific phytoplanktons were Leptolynbya granulifera, Arthospira jenerii, Cymbella cymbiformis, Frustulia vulgaris. Conclusion: It is hoped that results/data obtained from the present study (P-maps) may go a long way in solving the mysteries related to the deaths due to drowning and can be usefully used as a reference data for determining the exact site of drowning.					; Luthra, Deepali/HKE-2283-2023; KHATTAR, JIS/D-9797-2011	KHATTAR, JIS/0000-0003-4946-3746; thakar, mukesh/0000-0001-9264-0862; 													2090-536X	2090-5939				DEC	2018	8	1							38	10.1186/s41935-018-0068-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41935-018-0068-4													WOS:000461150100038

Geospatial patterns and models of subsistence land use in rural Interior Alaska	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Alaska Native people and rural Alaskans rely on subsistence harvesting of wild resources for their well-being. This study integrates publicly-available data from >30 Interior Alaskan communities to examine the geospatial patterns of subsistence and develop model-based maps of subsistence land use for the region. Through analysis and identification of lands important for subsistence, this study provides a tool to inform sound decision-making on land use and facilitate communication among land users. We found that most contemporary subsistence land use (approx. 70%) occurred within areas that have been traditionally used for generations. The size of subsistence use areas varied widely among communities (approx. 50-25,000 km(2)) and was directly related to total population. Subsistence land use varied both by resource type and by season, which reflects differences in resource availability and harvesting strategies. The spatial patterns of subsistence land use were strongly influenced by accessibility, which differed between remote and road-connected communities. Our logistic regression models showed that subsistence land use was largely predictable by distance to communities, distance to main travel corridors (roads and/or rivers), distance to lakes (for remote communities), and population size. Probability maps of subsistence use were generated and classified into used and unused areas with accuracies from 83-86%. Results suggest a large spatial extent (353,771 km(2)) of subsistence land use in Interior Alaska, comprising >60% of the land area of this sparsely-populated region. The outcomes of this study provide a more comprehensive view of subsistence land use patterns and spatial products that may help reduce conflict and inform decisions affecting lands and resources important for sustaining the subsistence way of life.

Fairy shrimps are among the most threatened invertebrates in ephemeral waters, as they are extremely vulnerable to habitat loss. Chirocephalus sibyllae is a fairy shrimp endemic to the Palazzo Borghese temporary pond, located within Sibillini Mountains National Park (Central Italy). The aims of the present study were to: (i) evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of C. sibyllae habitat, with special reference to climate changes over twenty years; (ii) document the life history, size, and abundance of C. sibyllae; and (iii) document the coexisting zooplankton fauna in Palazzo Borghese pond. The zooplankton community was monitored fortnightly, during the filling phases of the pond, from April 2019 to June 2021, using an 80 mu m mesh net, within transects of known length. On each sampling occasion, 13 physicochemical parameters were measured, and water-level fluctuations and pond surface area were recorded. Compared to what was reported in the literature, in the last two years the wet phase of the Palazzo Borghese pond was shorter, and the pool dried up much earlier than in the past. The water quality was good and reflected the typical characteristics of high-mountain oligotrophic ponds. Orthophosphates seem to play a key role in zooplankton population abundance, increasing over time during the filling period. According to the extreme unpredictability of environmental features, the zooplankton community was composed of a very limited number of species, adapted to face drought conditions for most of the year. C. sibyllae life-history traits showed a high number of cysts in the broodpouch of ovigerous females (mean +/- SD = 66.0 +/- 38.9), and a higher mean total length of adults (1.72 cm for females and 1.76 cm for males), in comparison to data reported in the literature. The year 2019 was configured as the season with the most favorable conditions for the development of C. sibyllae; in 2020, the short duration of the pond did not allow the species to complete its life cycle. Climate change seems to pose the main threat to the species, considering that the progressive increase in air temperatures and the decrease in snowfall will, likely, lead to increasingly shorter filling phases of its habitat.					federico, morandi/OEP-3336-2025; Tagliaferri, Gianpiero/ABD-7556-2021; lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020	lorenzoni, massimo/0000-0002-8548-9487; Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287; 														2073-4441				JUN	2022	14	11							1750	10.3390/w14111750	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14111750													WOS:000808939500001
J	Chen, CY; Lai, IL; Chang, SC				Chen, Chun-Yao; Lai, I-Ling; Chang, Shih-Chieh			Changes in Soil Microbial Community and Carbon Flux Regime across a Subtropical Montane Peatland-to-Forest Successional Series in Taiwan	FORESTS												Subtropical montane peatland is among several rare ecosystems that continue to receive insufficient scientific exploration. We analyzed the vegetation types and soil bacterial composition, as well as surface carbon dioxide and methane fluxes along a successional peatland-to-upland-forest series in one such ecosystem in Taiwan. The Yuanyang Lake (YYL) study site is characterized by low temperature, high precipitation, prevailing fog, and acidic soil, which are typical conditions for the surrounding dominant Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana forest. Bacterial communities were dominated by Acidobacteriota and Proteobacteria. Along the bog-to-forest gradient, Proteobacteria decreased and Acidobacteriota increased while CO2 fluxes increased and CH4 fluxes decreased. Principal coordinate analysis allowed separating samples into four clusters, which correspond to samples from the bog, marsh, forest, and forest outside of the watershed. The majority of bacterial genera were found in all plots, suggesting that these communities can easily switch to other types. Variation among samples from the same vegetation type suggests influence of habitat heterogeneity on bacterial community composition. Variations of soil water content and season caused the variations of carbon fluxes. While CO2 flux decreased exponentially with increasing soil water content, the CH4 fluxes exhibited an exponential increase together with soil water content. Because YYL is in a process of gradual terrestrialization, especially under the warming climate, we expect changes in microbial composition and the greenhouse gas budget at the landscape scale within the next decades.

J	Koperski, P				Koperski, Pawel			Hydrological Instability of Ponds Reduces Functional Diversity of Freshwater Molluscs in Protected Wetlands	WETLANDS												Different facets of biodiversity of freshwater molluscs were compared in 21 small ponds located in the wetland area around Lake Luknajno (Nature Reserve protected by Ramsar Convention, UNESCO Biosphere Reserve). The ponds examined between 2010 and 2019 differed in their susceptibility to periodical drying out. In addition, the hydrological stability of many of them was significantly reduced in 2015-19 as a result of climatic changes (decrease in precipitation, shortening of the snow cover period, increase in the average temperature during the growing season, increase in the frequency of heat waves). The functional diversity of molluscs decreased linearly and monotonically with the increase in the frequency and intensity of drying up of ponds, so it can be treated as a good indicator of their hydrological instability. Other facets of biological diversity - taxonomic and phylogenetic - were unimodally related to differences in stability. Along time, species resistant to desiccation being specialized inhabitants of temporary water bodies clearly increase their percentage, and the share of species less resistant decreases.

Although they are attracted by abundant food resources, reproductive output and survival of animals may be affected by some other environmental factors. This study found that Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding near water bodies were caught in an ecological trap. We found that the number of fledglings, their body mass, and tarsus length were positively correlated to the distance to the lakes. The number of blood-sucking insects, adult body mass at the end of the breeding season, and the distance to the nearest water body were negatively correlated, suggesting that breeding near forest water bodies comes at a cost. More studies must be done to understand the role of different kinds of blood parasites and their vectors in fitness reduction of birds. We recommend avoiding putting bird nest boxes near forest water bodies to mitigate the damaging effects of maladaptive habitat selection of cavity-nesting birds. Blood parasites are considered to have strong negative effects on host fitness. Negative fitness consequences may be associated with proximity to areas where blood parasite vectors reproduce. This study tested for relationships between haemosporidian infection prevalence, parasitemia, and fitness parameters of breeding Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) at different distances from forest water bodies. Prevalence and parasitemias (the intensity of infection) of haemosporidians and vector abundance generally decreased with increasing distance from forest lakes, streams, and bogs. Fledgling numbers were lower, and their condition was worse in the vicinity of water bodies, compared with those located one kilometer away from lakes and streams. At the beginning of the breeding season, adult body mass was not related to distance to the nearest water body, whereas at the end of the breeding season body mass was significantly lower closer to water bodies. Forest areas around water bodies may represent ecological traps for Pied Flycatchers. Installing nest boxes in the vicinity of forest water bodies creates unintended ecological traps that may have conservation implications.

J	Wilson, CC; Haxton, T; Wozney, KM; Friday, M				Wilson, Chris C.; Haxton, Tim; Wozney, Kristyne M.; Friday, Mike			Historical genetic connectivity of lake sturgeon in a dammed Great Lakes tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) populations are the focus of rehabilitation efforts across the Great Lakes. Although historical fisheries were a major cause of population collapses, habitat fragmentation and/or loss and reduced access to spawning and juvenile habitat impose contemporary challenges for population recovery. The loss of connectivity between habitat types required by different life stages may particularly limit recruitment rates, inhibiting population increase towards recovery targets. We used microsatellite DNA genotyping to assess population structure, diversity, and historical connectivity of lake sturgeon in the Black Sturgeon River watershed, a major tributary of Black Bay, Lake Superior with both historical and contemporary dams. Genotype data from lake sturgeon sampled above and below an existing major barrier, as well as from lakes in the upper watershed, showed evidence of historical connectivity throughout the watershed. Despite the existing barrier fragmenting the river and preventing upstream migration, lake sturgeon from the Black Sturgeon watershed showed clear membership to a single ancestral gene pool. Estimates of genetic effective population size (N-e) for the above-and below-barrier population segments were reduced compared to the larger (watershed level) gene pool. Although the longevity of lake sturgeon has largely enabled the retention of historical genetic diversity for the population in the watershed, the reduced productive capacity of this significant tributary may have implications for recovery rates for the regional Lake Superior metapopulation. Restoring connectivity among habitats would benefit the long-term conservation and management of this species throughout this river system, and potentially the regional metapopulation.

This study examined the fate of NO3--N, 38 antibiotics, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Baiyangdian Basin, through dry and wet seasonal (after extreme rainfall) samplings at 2023. In the system, NO3--N and Sigma antibiotics average concentrations were higher in the dry season, while the relative abundance of humic-like components was higher in the wet season. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the high-high clusters of pollutants and DOM components were mainly distributed in rivers, and the temporal difference was significant. MixSIAR and PMF model were respectively applied to nitrogen and antibiotics sources apportionment. The results showed that non-point sources (NPS) of nitrogen and antibiotics exhibited an upward trend, while the point sources decreased from dry to wet seasons. Hydrological connectivity was characterized by using delta O-18-H2O, which was higher in the wet season. Partial least squares path model revealed that hydrological connectivity directly impacted humic-like components, which were the direct influencing factor of the concentration and NPS for antibiotics and nitrogen in the connected system. Extreme rainfall weaken the impact of hydrological connectivity on the concentration and NPS of pollutants, while enhanced the impact of humic-like components on pollutants NPS. These findings clarified the impact mechanism of hydrological connectivity and DOM on nitrogen and antibiotics fate in the connected system, which plays an important role in future water quality management under extreme events.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				APR	2025	378								124743	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124743		MAR 2025						40031423					WOS:001438864300001

Improvements in Mero River Basin Water Supply Regulation Through Integration of a Mining Pit Lake as a Water Supply Source	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal increases in demand puts a strain on water supplies in the city of La Corua (northwest Spain) and its surroundings during times of drought. Exploitation of Meirama Lake, a pit lake forming in a former lignite mine, could supplement the Abegondo-Cecebre reservoir, the city's main water supply. We analysed the hydrochemistry and the Mero River basin regulations to determine whether the water quantity and quality could meet the needs during periods of increased demand and drought, and still satisfy ecological conditions required by law.

Both the attributes of a species and the environment it experiences can help to predict shifts from one particular care mode to another. Nevertheless, factors inducing differences in care strategies among closely related species, or seasonal variation within species, have been subject to surprisingly little empirical testing. Here, we report the results of a field-based study that examined both among and within species variation in mate desertion in five species of closely related Nicaraguan cichlid fish in the genera Amphilophus and Amatitlania. The results show a link between female body size and male involvement in offspring care. Specifically, the larger the species the less often males were found to provide extended care. Furthermore, we found that solitary females became more common towards the end of the breeding season. We discuss the implications of this finding in the context of previous theoretical and empirical contributions regarding the frequency of offspring desertion by males.

This buried surface has yielded plant macrofossils in growth position, as well as numerous insect excellently preserved in permafrost. It appears that many of the insects were buried alive by the fossils, excellently preserved in permafrost. It appears that many of the insects were buried alive by the volcanic ash. The species composition and ecological affinities of this fossil fauna are typical of Alaskan Late Pleistocene steppe-tundra environments. The assemblages are dominated by the weevil Lepidophorus one of the most common species in Eastern Beringian Pleistocene fossil assemblages. Many other lineaticollis, one of the most common species in Eastern Beringian Pleistocene fossil assemblages. Many other members of the ancient steppe-tundra insect community are preserved in these assemblages, including the pill beetle Morychus sp. and weevils of the genus Coniocleonus. In Alaska, most of these species (but not all of them) survived the Pleistocene/Holocene environmental transition, but are restricted today to relict patches of steppe-like vegetation. Faunal diversity is low, in spite of the recovery of more than 1000 individual insects and mites including more than 600 beetles. This reflects the small number of species adapted to the cold, dry environments of the LGM in Eastern Beringia. They represent an ecosystem which no longer exists.

M.; Miyazaki, Rosina D.; dos Santos, Marina Atanaka			Habitat suitability mapping of Anopheles darlingi in the surroundings of the Manso hydropower plant reservoir, Mato Grosso, Central Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS												Background: Hydropower plants provide more than 78% of Brazil's electricity generation, but the country's reservoirs are potential new habitats for main vectors of malaria. In a case study in the surroundings of the Manso hydropower plant in Mato Grosso state, Central Brazil, habitat suitability of Anopheles darlingi was studied. Habitat profile was characterized by collecting environmental data. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were applied to extract additional spatial layers of land use, distance maps, and relief characteristics for spatial model building. Results: Logistic regression analysis and ROC curves indicate significant relationships between the environment and presence of An. darlingi. Probabilities of presence strongly vary as a function of land cover and distance from the lake shoreline. Vector presence was associated with spatial proximity to reservoir and semi-deciduous forests followed by Cerrado woodland. Vector absence was associated with open vegetation formations such as grasslands and agricultural areas. We suppose that non-significant differences of vector incidences between rainy and dry seasons are associated with the availability of anthropogenic breeding habitat of the reservoir throughout the year. Conclusion: Satellite image classification and multitemporal shoreline simulations through DEMbased GIS-analyses consist in a valuable tool for spatial modeling of A. darlingi habitats in the studied hydropower reservoir area. Vector presence is significantly increased in forested areas near reservoirs in bays protected from wind and wave action. Construction of new reservoirs under the tropical, sub-humid climatic conditions should therefore be accompanied by entomologic studies to predict the risk of malaria epidemics.					dos Santos, Emerson/J-7582-2018; Soares dos Santos, Emerson/J-7582-2018	Zeilhofer, Peter/0000-0002-7579-6408; Soares dos Santos, Emerson/0000-0003-2709-5591													1476-072X					MAR 7	2007	6								7	10.1186/1476-072X-6-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-6-7								17343728					WOS:000258119800001
J	Naithani, J; Plisnier, PD; Deleersnijder, E				Naithani, Jaya; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis; Deleersnijder, Eric			Possible effects of global climate change on the ecosystem of Lake Tanganyika	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Any change in the air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and incoming solar radiation induced by increasing greenhouse gasses and climate change will directly influence lakes and other water bodies. The influence can cause changes in the physical (water temperature, stratification, transparency), chemical (nutrient loading, oxygen) and biological (structure and functioning of the ecosystem) components of the Lake. In this work an influence of the likely effects of the climate change on the above three components of Lake Tanganyika are studied by means of a simple ecological model. Simulations for the years 2002-2009 have been performed using the wind and solar radiation data from the National Centres for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalysis. Various possible climatic scenarios are studied by changing the surface layer depth, its temperature and the wind stress. Any change in any of the above physical forcing parameters modifies the timing and intensity of the dry season peaks of the biogeochemical parameters. It is seen that the gross production increases as temperature of the surface layer increases and its depth decreases. High temperature and low wind stress, reduces the biomass. The effects of a slight increase in lake water temperature on the Lake Tanganyika ecosystem might be mitigated by increased windiness, if the latter was sufficient to induce greater mixing.

J	Jones, MV; West, RJ				Jones, MV; West, RJ			Spatial and temporal variability of seagrass fishes in intermittently closed and open coastal lakes in southeastern Australia	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A large-scale survey of seagrass fish communities was carried out quarterly over a three-year period in six coastal lakes with entrances that were intermittently closed and open to the ocean. These coastal lakes, located along similar to 400 km of the southeastern Australian coastline, ranged from 4.2 km(2) to 38.9 km(2) in water area, but experienced a similar range of salinities, temperatures, pH and turbidities over the study period. A total of 203 936 individual fish, belonging to 46 families and 93 species, were caught and released, with the most diverse families being the Gobiidae (12 species), Monacanthidae (9 species) and Syngnathidae (7 species). There were major changes in numbers of fish caught between years, accompanied by changes in the compositions of the species assemblages. These changes were associated with heavy rainfall and flooding in the region during the second year of the study, which caused the opening of all lakes to the sea, and allowed recruitment of marine spawning species. This inter-annual variability was much larger than any of the seasonal or spatial differences observed, which were inconsistent within and between the studied lakes. The salinity regime of individual lakes played a role in structuring the fish assemblages on a regional scale, rather than any obvious biogeographic factors. Artificially opening the entrance of one lake, to alleviate flooding, resulted in the loss of a large seagrass bed and a subsequent decline in recruitment of economically important fish species to that area. The research suggests that, for these small estuaries, conservation of fish diversity might best be achieved on a "whole-of-estuary" basis, rather than by zoning of areas within individual lakes. It also indicated that artificially opening the lakes, or carrying out other entrance works, should be done with great caution as the impact that these activities may have on their fish communities remains largely unpredictable.

Extracting these indicators from remote sensing data enables rapid and efficient inversion of water quality conditions, providing a key step in predicting water pollution. The low-precision inversion results of WQI limit the understanding of the ecological safety of water resources. In this paper, the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) data from the GF-5 satellite was used to analyze the Dianchi Lake. A spectrum processing method based on the Savitzky-Golay Standard Normal Variate transformation (SG-SNV) was developed, alongside optimal inversion techniques, to enhance the accuracy of predictions for 6 WQI in Dianchi, including CODcr, NH3-N, TP, TN, pH, and Chl. The results indicated that (1) For all inversion models, the determination coefficients (R2) exceeded 0.85. The Back Propagation Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (BP-NGA) model consistently yielded positive results for most WQI. (2) Water quality in Dianchi varied significantly by region and season. (3) It was recommended to build wetlands and ecological parks on the southwest side of Dianchi and improve sewage interception pipelines on the northeast side to lessen the risk of eutrophication by reducing the inflow of nitrogen and phosphorus.																			2045-2322					FEB 25	2025	15	1							6760	10.1038/s41598-025-91011-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-91011-1								40000875					WOS:001432705000038

The method relies on quick sampling of shallow groundwater, direct analysis of EC in the field, and relatively in-expensive analysis of delta O-18 in the laboratory. Ternary uncertain end-member mixing analysis (precipitation, groundwater, and lake water) quantified the composition of water discharging to and recharging from the lake. The tracer distribution and mixing analysis were in agreement with the interpreted groundwater flow near the lake. The use of only one tracer (either delta O-18 or EC) gave the same results for the recharge segments, but the discharge segments changed the origin of the water from being groundwater to precipitation controlled. The two tracers complemented each other, especially with different signals in precipitation and groundwater. The uncertain end-members were assessed based on local (groundwater and lake water) and off-site (precipitation) data. The off-site data were found to be useful if it contained representative information on local-site seasonality (uncertainty, variance). Final end-member concentrations could explain the transience of the hydrology at the site (i.e., flooding of the area adjacent to the lake during periods with high precipitation, and variability of the delta O-18 signal in precipitation). This methodology potentially represents a new option to study groundwater-lake systems. The tracer information collected over only two days is useful by itself for developing the next steps like the quantification of fluxes based on other standard methods (Darcy approach, seepage meters, or temperature). The tracer information can provide quantitative estimation of inputs and outputs by using the mixing analysis.					; Engesgaard, Peter/P-1674-2014; Duque, Carlos/AAA-6410-2020	Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571; Engesgaard, Peter/0000-0002-5925-8757; 														2073-4441				JUN	2020	12	6							1608	10.3390/w12061608	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061608													WOS:000549440600001
J	Benítez-Valenzuela, LI; Sanchez-Mejia, ZM				Irene Benitez-Valenzuela, Lidia; Mayari Sanchez-Mejia, Zulia			Observations of Turbulent Heat Fluxes Variability in a Semiarid Coastal Lagoon (Gulf of California)	ATMOSPHERE												Despite the critical role latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat play in turbulent processes and heat exchange in the water-air interface, there is a lack of studies of turbulent fluxes over the surface in semiarid regions. We collected continuous measurements of net radiation (Rn), LE, H, and micrometeorological data at a coastal lagoon in the Gulf of California during 2019 with an eddy covariance (EC) system. We analyzed the time series, considering the North American Monsoon System, the pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon season. Results show that Rn (276 +/- 118 W m(-2)) and turbulent fluxes were higher during the monsoon season (July-September) LE (129 +/- 18 W m(-2)), and H (29 +/- 9 W m(-2)). The monthly average of Rn, LE, and H was highest in June (493.9 W m(-2)), August (142 W m(-2)), and May (50 W m(-2)), respectively. Furthermore, during the monsoon season, the (H+LE)/Rn ratio (0.74) suggests that more than half of the Rn reaching the coastal lagoon is used for the turbulent exchange of LE and H. During the pre-monsoon, LE (r(2)= 0.36) increases with a higher vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while H (r(2)= 0.66) increases with a higher friction velocity (u*) during the monsoon season. Quantitative observations are essential for further research.

J	Wang, ZG; Chai, F; Brady, D				Wang, Zhengui; Chai, Fei; Brady, Damian			Development of a new sediment flux model - Application in Chesapeake Bay	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Sediment biogeochemical processes impact pelagic ecosystems when the sediment receives particulate organic matter (POM) deposited from the water column above, consumes dissolved oxygen, and returns inorganic nutrients to the bottom water. However, an easy-to-apply sediment model is still lacking for pelagic biogeochemical modeling. In this study, we proposed a mass conservative, process-based and easy-to-apply sediment flux model (SFM) that endeavors to simplify Di Toro (2001)'s sediment flux model (DSFM) while maintaining the ability to model sediment fluxes in multiple environments (e.g., anoxic, normoxic, variable salinity, high and low organic matter deposition, etc.). It adopts a vertically integrated approach, and has a relatively simple structure with limited number of parameters. The mineralization scheme for POM is based on bacterial growth, which can resolve the diagenesis processes on different timescales. The inhibition effects of oxygen on denitrification of NO3 and desorption of PO4 are modeled using exponential functions. This new SFM is then implemented in the Chesapeake Bay to simulate sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and sediment NH4/NO3/PO4/Silica fluxes across the sediment-water interface. To estimate POM depositional fluxes from the water column, a new method is introduced that links surficial sediment and bottom-water POM concentrations. Further integration of this method into the SFM turns the model calibration into a mass conservative and self-consistent process, which is well constrained by observations. The modeled sediment fluxes from the new SFM match observations across seasons and stations with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. The successful application of SFM in Chesapeake Bay and subsequent analysis show that the new SFM has many advantages including mass conservation, high temporal resolution, relatively simple structure, and easy implementation. The SFM is a good tool for linking pelagic ecosystem models to sediment biogeochemical processes.					; Chai, Fei/LXW-0992-2024	Wang, Zhengui/0000-0002-1867-3575; 													0079-6611					JUN	2020	185								102332	10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102332													WOS:000538104400003

By setting the NDVI values below the threshold of 0.2 as 0, NDVI_0.2 was created to eliminate the noise caused by changes of surface albedo during non-growing period. TimeSat was employed to estimate the growing season length (GSL) from the seasonal variation of NDVI. Statistical analyses were conducted to reveal the mechanisms of climate-vegetation interactions in the cold and semi-arid Upper Amur River Basin of Northeast Asia. The results showed that the regional climate change can be summarized as warming and drying. Annual mean air temperature (T) increased at a rate of 0.13 degrees C per decade. Annual precipitation (P) declined at a rate of 18.22 mm per decade. NDVI had an insignificantly negative trend, whereas, NDVI_0.2 displayed a significantly positive trend (MK test, p < 0.05) over the past three decades. GSL had a significantly positive rate of approximately 2.9 days per decade. Correlation analysis revealed that, NDVI was significantly correlated with amount of P, whereas, GSL was highly correlated with warmth index (WMI), accumulation of monthly T above the threshold of 5 degrees C. Principal regression analysis revealed that the inter-annual variations of NDVI, NDVI_0.2 and GSL were mostly contributed by WMI. Spatially, NDVI in grassland was more sensitive to P, whereas, T was more important in areas of high elevation. GSL in most of the areas displayed high sensitivity to T. This study examined the different roles of climate variables in controlling the vegetation activities. Further studies are needed to reveal the impact of extended GSL on the regional water balance and the water level of regional lakes, providing the habitats for the migratory birds and endangered species.

AQUATIC BOTANY												The lamina area damaged and biomass per leaves removed by invertebrate herbivores were measured across seasons on water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms (Pontederiaceae). The amount of the leaf biomass per meter square lost through herbivory was also assessed in different sampling dates in the plant population. Ten leaves of water hyacinth were sampled in each of 18 site-habitat-date combinations. Sampling dates were chosen to follow the plant phenology. The lamina area damaged (surface abrasions and holes) was measured with the visual estimation method; biomass removed by herbivores (surface abrasions and holes) was calculated indirectly from the damaged lamina area. Significant differences in total damaged area and removed biomass per lamina were found between sampling dates at each site, with highest values in March (end of growth period). Total damaged area per lamina (surface abrasions + holes) varied between 11% in March and 6% in July (decay period). Total removed biomass (surface abrasions + holes) varied between 27% in March and 13% in July. Significant differences in biomass removed by herbivory were found between sampling dates at each site. Biomass of lamina removed by herbivores per m(-2) varied between 26 and 13% in different seasons. The herbivore damage of discrete samples and the indirect method to calculate the biomass removed is useful in sites with aquatic free floating plants, where experimental exclusion of insects may be difficult to carry out.

The gold standard methods for monitoring cyanoHABs involve enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), liquid chromatography combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and manual cell counting under microscopy. However, these techniques, while effective, are costly and time-consuming, which may not be optimal for timely decision-making to safeguard public health. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) offers a complementary approach that serves as an indicator of the potential for toxin production. It provides accurate results with a rapid turnaround time and high throughput capacity, and greater affordability. To assess the reliability of qPCR in predicting toxin production and determining when toxin levels exceed recreational advisory thresholds, we conducted experiments utilizing two DNA extraction methods for qPCR testing: RapidDNA and ClassicDNA. Sampling was conducted across nine water bodies in Utah throughout the recreational season from June 1 to October 31, 2023. We targeted cyanotoxin-encoding genes mainly associated with microcystins, the dominant cyanotoxin reported for these water bodies, for qPCR analysis. Toxin levels were measured using both ELISA and LC-MS/MS with cyanobacteria cell counting conducted as a reference. Out of nine water bodies studied, cyanoHABs were detected in five (i.e., Utah Lake, and Deer Creek, Echo, Schofield, and Pineview Reservoirs). Analysis of the data revealed a significant linear relationship between both the qPCR results of mcyE (associated with microcystin production) obtained from RapidDNA and ClassicDNA methods, and the levels of microcystins measured by ELISA and LCMS/MS. RapidDNA qPCR methods offer a potential warning tool for indicating toxin production during blooming events, though this method is not suitable for determining risk during the pre-blooming period. Conversely, ClassicDNA methods can be utilized during the pre-blooming period to prepare for potential blooms. These results provide insight into the genetic potential of blooms around the state to produce microcystins. Findings can be implemented in both Recreational Water Quality and Drinking Water programs nationally.

We tested the effectiveness of the morphology-based functional group (MBFG) approach as a model of phytoplankton temporal dynamics in a Brazilian subtropical river. The Sao Joao River has an area of approximately 79.10 km(2), with 28.09 km(2) located within the Iguac,u National Park, in Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil. We collected phytoplankton samples and measured environmental variables in the intermediate river section on a monthly basis between August 2008 and July 2009. We tested for differences between the environmental variables, phytoplankton biovolume and sampled months and identified the environmental variables with the greatest influence on MBFGs. Our results revealed clear temporal variability of environmental conditions in this river. We recorded the presence of seven MBFGs (I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII) in the lotic environment, with MBFG IV (chlorococcal chlorophyceans and desmids), V (flagellates) and VI (diatoms) being the most frequent and most important groups for phytoplankton biomass. Significant temporal differences were found for MBFGs I, II, IV, V and VI, with a clear seasonal succession, especially among MBFGs V and VI. Temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, transparency and nutrients were the main predictors of MBFGs in the Sao Joao River. Approaches based on traits have been increasingly applied in community ecology, and we believe that the MBFG approach can increase our understanding of environmental dynamics as well as improve the assessment of general ecological issues.

The lake has long suffered from eutrophication. In the early 1980s, a restoration plan resulted in a progressive reduction in the phosphorus concentration. During the same period, the lake responded to large-scale climate changes by overall warming of the water, and changes in the timing of stratification. Both the composition and the phenology of the plankton have been affected. This paper focuses on the long-term changes observed in the copepod community. Our findings highlight a switch towards a copepod community dominated by calanoids. In addition we have detected a period (1986 to 1991, 1988 excluded) characterized by an unusual seasonal pattern of species succession. It is suggested that these changes have been induced by qualitative changes in the phytoplankton community, and underline fluctuations in trophic interactions between planktonic species. Re-oligotrophication and warming, therefore, emerge as indirect forcing factors, and these findings contribute to the debate about whether copepods can be used as indicators of environmental changes.					; Souissi, Sami/C-5146-2018	Souissi, Sami/0000-0002-6720-0096; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	2007	29			1			I49	I59		10.1093/plankt/fbl066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbl066													WOS:000208220100006

A field study was designed to investigate the occurrence and distribution of diuron and its transformation products at a poorly drained field site located along an intermittent tributary of Lake Creek in the southern Willamette Valley of Oregon. The experimental sites consisted of a field under commercial grass seed production with a cultivated riparian zone and a second site that was part of the same grass seed field but with a noncultivated riparian zone. Diuron and its transformation product DCPMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylmeal were the only significant residues detected in this study. Concentrations of diuron in surface water declined from a maximum of 28 mug/L immediately following application to low levels that persisted as long as flow was present. Diuron and DCPMU concentrations in shallow ground water (15-36 cm below ground surface) were highest (2-13 mug/L) in the zone immediately adjacent (0.5 m) to Lake Creek and indicated the influence of stream water on shallow ground water near the stream. Diuron and DCPMU detected in soil prior to the second season's application indicated the persistence of diuron and DCPMU from the previous year's application. Surface runoff during the rainy season removes only a very small percentage (<1%) of the applied herbicide. In addition, no evidence was obtained for the downward transport of diuron or its transformation products to deep ground water.																			0047-2425					JAN-FEB	2003	32	1					171	179											12549556					WOS:000181953400020
J	Nerkar, SS; Tamhankar, AJ; Johansson, E; Lundborg, CS				Nerkar, Sandeep S.; Tamhankar, Ashok J.; Johansson, Eva; Lundborg, Cecilia Stalsby			Improvement in health and empowerment of families as a result of watershed management in a tribal area in India - a qualitative study	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS												Background: Tribal people in India, as in other parts of the world, reside mostly in forests and/or hilly terrains. Water scarcity and health problems related to it are their prime concern. Watershed management can contribute to resolve their health related problems and can put them on a path of socio-economic development. Integrated management of land, water and biomass resources within a watershed, i.e. in an area or a region which contributes rainfall water to a river or lake, is referred to as watershed management. Watershed management includes soil and water conservation to create water resources, management of drinking water, improving hygiene and sanitation, plantation of trees, improving agriculture, formation of self-help groups and proper utilisation and management of available natural resources. For successful implementation of such a solution, understanding of perceptions of the tribal community members with regard to public health and socioeconomic implications of watershed management is essential. Methods: A qualitative study with six focus group discussions (FGDs), three each separately for men and women, was conducted among tribal community members of the Maharashtra state of India. The data collected from the FGDs were analyzed using manifest and latent content analysis. Results: "Improvement in health and empowerment of families as a result of watershed management" was identified as the main theme. Participants perceived that their health problems and socio-economic development are directly and/or indirectly dependent upon water availability. They further perceived that watershed management could directly or indirectly result in reduction of their public health related challenges like waterborne diseases, seasonal migration, alcoholism, intimate partner violence, as well as drudgery of women and may enhance overall empowerment of families through agricultural development. Conclusions: Tribal people perceived that water scarcity is the main reason for their physical, mental and social health problems and a major obstacle for their overall development. The perceptions of tribal participants indicate that infectious diseases, migration, alcoholism, intimate partner violence and drudgery of women are end results of water scarcity and efforts to increase water availability through watershed management may help them to achieve their right to health which is embedded in their right to access to water.					; Johansson, Eva/H-6145-2017	Stalsby Lundborg, Cecilia/0000-0001-6525-1861; Tamhankar, Ashok/0000-0003-0731-1680; 														1472-698X				OCT 12	2013	13								42	10.1186/1472-698X-13-42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-698X-13-42								24119537					WOS:000328489700001
J	Antonopoulos, VZ; Gianniou, SK				Antonopoulos, VZ; Gianniou, SK			Simulation of water temperature and dissolved oxygen distribution in Lake Vegoritis, Greece	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Changes in lake water temperature and temperature stratification. dynamics can have a profound effect on lake biological and chemical processes. A one-dimensional temperature stratification and oxygen prediction model was developed to simulate the seasonal temperature cycle and oxygen distribution for Lake Vegoritis in Northern Greece. The submodel of heat transport is based on the non-linear heat transfer equation using daily weather parameters as input data. The dissolved oxygen (D.O.) submodel is based on the unsteady diffusion equation with the oxygen fluxes through the free surface and bottom of lake as boundary conditions, and photosynthetic oxygen production, biochemical oxygen demand and plant respiration as internal sources and sinks. The solution of these equations uses the finite element method. The model was calibrated and verified by using-data from Lake Vegoritis from two different years (1981 and 1993). The model results showed that there was good agreement between, the simulated land the measured values of water temperature and D.O. at different depths in the lake and on different days of the year.

Expanding the European water Framework Directive indicators to address long-term climate change impacts on lakes using mechanistic lake models	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Climate change is altering lake ecosystems at an unprecedented rate, disrupting thermal regimes, biogeochemical cycles, and key ecological functions essential for human use such as drinking water, fisheries, and recreational activities. However, climate effects are often studied in isolation and over short time periods, which limits our ability to quantify the extent and speed of multifaceted ecological changes as well as our understanding of how lakes will evolve under climate change. We present a framework that integrates computer modelling, long-term forecasting, and multi-decadal limnological data to comprehensively evaluate 25 key metrics within the European Water Framework Directive related to lake functioning and ecological status through to 2100. Long-term projections of the effects of climate change were based on lake priority uses: 1) overall functioning, which supports aesthetic value and general attractiveness, 2) drinking water supply, and 3) stock of salmonids. Our findings reveal that although key thermal regime changes have already occurred, higher water temperatures will progressively push deeper salmonid habitat on both annual and seasonal scales. Favourable conditions for salmonids reproduction will exceed tolerance limits by 2050, and fishery management adjustments are needed. Conversely, drinking water supply should remain unaffected until 2100, assuming stable nutrient inputs and pollution levels. This approach offers a tool for forecasting climate change's impacts on lakes, allowing decisionmakers to anticipate measures to ensure long-term ecological and human benefits.

J	Romero-Viana, L; Kienel, U; Wilkes, H; Sachse, D				Romero-Viana, Lidia; Kienel, Ulrike; Wilkes, Heinz; Sachse, Dirk			Growth-dependent hydrogen isotopic fractionation of algal lipid biomarkers in hypersaline Isabel Lake (Mexico)	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In this study, we evaluated the potential of the hydrogen isotopic composition of algal lipid biomarkers as a proxy for past hydroclimatic variability in hypersaline Isabel Lake, Mexico (Eastern Pacific). We compared rainfall variability recorded in the region over the last 65 years with changes in delta D values of the most abundant compounds preserved in the uppermost 16 cm of lake sediment. Changes in delta D values of the 1,15-C-32 diol (delta D-diol), a specific biomarker of algal populations, were related to rainfall variability; specifically, n-alkyl diols were more deuterium-enriched (depleted) during wetter (drier) periods. Strikingly, neither the magnitude of lipid biomarker isotopic changes over interannual timescales (of up to 70-80 parts per thousand) nor the direction of that variability can be explained by changes in delta D values of the water source or salinity fluctuations (approximately 30 on the practical salinity scale) controlled by seasonal rainfall. However, changes in sedimentary biomarker composition, higher total organic carbon content and less negative delta C-13 values of the 1,15-C-32 diol indicate enhanced algal growth during wetter periods. We find that these conditions result in less negative delta D values of n-alkyl diols. We hypothesize that due to higher lipid demand during enhanced algal growth, an increasing proportion of hydrogen for lipid synthesis is derived from the cytosol via oxidation of polysaccharides, which may cause a deuterium enrichment of the acetogenic compounds. This study has significant implications for paleohydrological reconstructions using algal lipid delta D values, particularly in highly seasonal environments such as Isabel Lake. In such environments, delta D values of specific algal lipid biomarkers may not record the full seasonal cycle in source water delta D but appear to be mainly controlled by the physiological state of algal populations. Our data provide the first evidence that changes in D/H fractionation due to algal growth conditions can be recorded in sediments. For paleoclimate reconstructions in such environments, algal growth conditions should be constrained with additional proxy data (delta C-13 values of the same biomarkers), as the net D/H fractionation between water and lipids may not have been constant over time.

J	Velez, MI; Martínez, JI; Suter, F				Velez, Maria Isabel; Martinez, Jose Ignacio; Suter, Fiore			Late Holocene history of the floodplain lakes of the Cauca River, Colombia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					PAGES International Floodplain Lake Workshop	SEP 16-19, 2010	Fayetteville, AR	PAGES				We conducted a paleolimnological investigation of late Holocene deposits on a distal, constrained floodplain of the Cauca River, northern Colombia, i.e. the La Caimana sedimentary succession. The record starts sometime between 4,500 and 4,000 cal yr BP, when the first high-energy fluvial events inundated an ancient soil surface. From that time until about 3,260 cal yr BP, a stable and probably seasonal flooding regime was established on the floodplain. From similar to 3,260 to similar to 2,800 cal yr BP, ephemeral and shallow swamps developed on the floodplain. Their formation and duration depended on their connection with the Cauca River. From similar to 2,800 to similar to 2,400 cal yr BP, fluvial influence became more dominant, establishing a semi-permanent connection between the river and the floodplain. From similar to 2,400 to 1,400 cal yr BP, episodic formation of ephemeral swamps occurred. During this stage, floodplain lakes displayed high salinity and nutrient concentrations, and possibly alkaline conditions as a consequence of reduced water volume when the connection with the river was reduced or lost completely. A change in the hydrological regime occurred from similar to 1,400 to similar to 850 cal yr BP, when high-energy fluvial events were punctuated by periods of reduced flooding that enabled soil formation. Generally, connection with the Cauca River resulted in lake waters with low salinity and nutrient concentration, whereas loss of connection with the river led to lakes with greater salinity and nutrient content. Paleocurrent analyses indicate that flows came predominantly from the Cauca River, suggesting the lakes were formed by the impoundment of La Caimana Creek. The sedimentary succession of La Caimana offers a unique, high-resolution record of the evolution and dynamics of an ancient floodplain of the Cauca River and its aquatic ecosystems.

We characterized the seasonal variation of DOM by employing a comprehensive approach incorporating absorption spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Results revealed that DOM seasonal variation could be the main factor driven lake N2O emission alteration. In warm seasons, lakes are predominant with recalcitrant aromatic compounds DOM released by phytoplankton, such as highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds, polyphenols., and lignin, accompanied by low N2O concentrations (0.03+0.02 mu mol/L). In cold seasons, bioavailable components (Aliphatic, Sugar-like, Peptide-like) are dominated in lakes, the increased abundance of S-containing compounds and low aromaticity compounds largely influenced by anthropogenic emissions, leads to elevated N2O concentrations (1.91+0.06 mu mol/L). The DOM with high bioavailable components promotes sediment N2O production (nir/nosZ (I+II)-type denitrifiers) (n = 678). Recalcitrant DOM reduced sediment nirK and nirS-type denitrifiers, and increased nosZ (I+II)-type denitrifiers, enhance the N2O reduction and led to a lower N2O emission. This study advances the understanding of the microbial mechanisms that DOM regulates N2O emissions in lakes.																				2589-9147				SEP 1	2025	28								100321	10.1016/j.wroa.2025.100321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wroa.2025.100321		FEB 2025											WOS:001428437500001
J	Zhang, X; Zhu, B				Zhang, Xue; Zhu, Bo			Changes of riparian soil-plant system phosphorus responding to hydrological alternations of Three Gorges Reservoir	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The anti-seasonal hydrological alternation in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) significantly impacts the release of phosphorus (P) from the riparian soil-plant system, posing a threat to the aquatic environment. To investigate this issue, riparian soils and plants in three tributaries of the central TGR were sampled at three distinct stages: early exposure, final exposure, and soon after inundation receded. Soil properties, P forms, and plant P content were analyzed. A significant decrease in exchangeable P and organic P during exposure, and a decrease in aluminum/iron-bound P during inundation were observed. These changes were linked to the mineralization of organic matter and the reduction of iron oxides. Compared to bioavailable inorganic P, bioavailable organic P contributed more to the total soil P release during the exposure-inundation cycle. Plant P uptake accounted for 76.08% of the bioavailable P released by the soil during exposure. During inundation, plant P release significantly exceeded soil P release. Therefore, the soil-plant system could act as a P "sink" during exposure and a P "source" during inundation. The hydrological alternation of the TGR was the primary driver of this "source-sink" transformation. To mitigate P release in riparian zones, recycling plant materials and establishing monitoring sites are recommended.																			2045-2322					FEB 15	2025	15	1							5629	10.1038/s41598-025-85942-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-85942-y								39955283					WOS:001422761100032
J	Wu, CH; Jiang, CL; Ju, MS; Pan, ZG				Wu, Chenhui; Jiang, Cuiling; Ju, Maosen; Pan, Zhengguo			Influence of meteorological elements and inflow pollution loads on cyanobacterial blooms trends: An integrated environmental fluid dynamics code model and comprehensive trend detection method	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Currently, the identification of the causes of cyanobacterial blooms remains a complex challenge owing to limited data availability, multiple influencing factors, and pronounced spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we investigated Xingyun Lake, a representative plateau lake, and Taihu Lake, a typical plain lake. Meteorological data from 1959 to 2023 and water quality data from 2010 to 2023 were collected. Employing the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model and a comprehensive trend detection method, we elucidated the characteristics and causes of cyanobacterial blooms in plateau and plain lakes on both spatial and temporal scales. The study results, using the EFDC water age module, demonstrated that differences in water age are a significant factor in regional differences in cyanobacterial blooms. The water ages along the shore of Xingyun Lake decreased with increased water flow from inflow rivers during the rainy season. However, higher nutrient concentrations from these rivers exacerbated cyanobacterial blooms. Conversely, due to the superior water quality of the Wangyu River, the diversion of water reduced the water age and mitigated the intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom in Taihu Lake. Results from the Theil-Sen median estimator and R/S analysis indicate that variations in meteorological elements influence the spatial and temporal distribution of cyanobacterial blooms, serving as primary drivers of cyanobacterial blooms in both lake types. High temperatures, low pressure, and weak wind conditions significantly impacted cyanobacterial blooms in both Xingyun Lake and Taihu Lake. As temperatures continue to increase and wind speeds decline, the probability of large-scale cyanobacterial blooms is expected to increase. Seasonal Kendall tests show that the overall water quality conditions in Xingyun Lake and Taihu Lake have improved since 2010. Nevertheless, both lakes continue to experience eutrophication issues, with nitrogen and phosphorus exceeding standards. The findings of this study contribute significantly to elucidating the mechanisms driving cyanobacterial blooms in plateau and plain lakes, providing a scientific basis for developing effective lake management plans and algae control strategies.					pan, zhengguo/KVA-4937-2024														0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2025	654								132789	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132789	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132789		FEB 2025											WOS:001427967200001

It is unclear, however, whether this practice provides a barrier against opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella. In this study, water samples were collected at 10 m depth intervals near the drinking water intakes of two lakes. Legionella and one of their common hosts, Acanthamoeba spp., were quantified using culture-based assays (Legionella pneumophila only) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). L. pneumophila and Acanthamoeba spp. were never detected by qPCR; Legionella spp., however, were present in all samples at concentrations ranging from 2.33 to 4.14 log(10) [copies/L] in lake A and from 2.69 to 4.27 log(10) [copies/L] in lake B. For most sampling months in both lakes, there was no significant difference between total bacteria and Legionella spp. concentrations at the intake depth versus those on the lake surface. The results of this limited investigation of two Norwegian water supplies suggest that placement of water treatment plant intakes within the hypolimnion may not afford a sufficient hygienic barrier against Legionella.

Pre- and post-monsoon variations in the magnetic susceptibilities of soils of Mumbai metropolitan region: implications to surface redistribution of urban soils loaded with anthropogenic particulates	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) in India represents one of the most industrialized and thickly populated areas of the monsoon dominated Asian region. We present here pre- and post-monsoon magnetic susceptibility variations in the top-soils representing sampling domains of industrial, heavy traffic and forested areas within MMR. The rock magnetic studies (including isothermal and anhysteric remanent magnetization and hysteresis loop analysis) infer predominant pseudo single domain to multi domain grains in an overall ferrimagnetic dominant mineralogy of the soils. The susceptibility-temperature variations (from -190 to 700A degrees C) infer maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) as the chief mineral component of pedogenic origin, and the pure magnetite (Fe3O4) is of anthropogenic nature. Spatial distribution of ferrimagnetic concentration is in agreement with polluting sources. The post-monsoon redistribution pattern is greatly controlled by the surface runoff and topographic conditions. The study demonstrates that in a ferrimagnetically reach substrate like MMR, the spatial distribution patterns derived from routine concentration- and grain-size-dependent rock magnetic parameters integrated with topographic and seasonal attributes yield significant information on the style and surface re-distribution of anthropogenically loaded soils and sediments to identify its seasonal dumping. Alternatively, knowing the source of signal, the magnetic susceptibility can be further used as a robust parameter to produce detailed maps to monitor the pollutions in urban areas.					; Badekar, Ananda/W-7084-2019; Sangode, Satish/MBG-5274-2025	Badekar, Ananda/0000-0002-0091-8781; Sangode, Satish/0000-0002-3433-977X; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2012	67	3					813	831		10.1007/s12665-012-1528-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1528-z													WOS:000308815100015

In the Protected Landscape Area and Biosphere reserve Trebonsko the bryozoan was first found in 2003 in one mesotrophic sandpit. The species gradually spread to many other sites around the Trebon area and at most of these locations its occurrence has invasion properties. Pectinatella expanded to some other sandpits, fishponds without intensive pisciculture. Pectinatella colonies are found mainly on submerged branches of willow trees. The differences between biomass in transects with the occurrence of shrub willow and biomass in transects without their presence were statistically significant in the total biomass weight and the number of colonies. The average weight of several colonies did not differ. The most important parameter affecting the occurrence was the low trophy of water. The water temperature is evidently an important factor affecting the seasonal dynamics of occurence. Differences in nitrogen and phosphorous content between the water outside and inside the colonies were statistically significant. The colonies also accumulate other elements, including microelements.

J	Nguyen, HVM; Shin, JK; Hur, J				Hang Vo-Minh Nguyen; Shin, Jae-Ki; Hur, Jin			Multivariate analysis for spatial distribution of dissolved organic matters in a large river-type dam reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In contrast to extensive studies of dissolved organic matters (DOM) in natural lakes, the distributions and the characteristics of DOM in artificial dam reservoirs have not been well documented despite a growing demand for the construction worldwide. For this study, spatial variations in the concentrations and the characteristics of DOM in Lake Paldang, a large river-type dam reservoir, were investigated using the concentrations, the specific UV absorbance (SUVA), the synchronous fluorescence spectra and the molecular weight (MWw) values. In addition, environmental factors determining the DOM spatial distribution were examined based on a principal component analysis (PCA). Variations in the DOM characteristics were greater than those for the concentrations (1.1-2.4 mg C/L). In contrast to typical lakes, vertical variations with a depth were much smaller than those observed among horizontal sampling sites within the reservoir. Irrespective of the depth, four individual sampling locations were easily distinguished by comparison of some selected DOM characteristics. The protein-like fluorescence (PLF), MWw and SUVA values observed at the location near the dam exceeded the corresponding values for the sampling locations near major influent rivers, suggesting that, even for the river-type dam reservoir, the downstream DOM characteristics may be governed by in-lake DOM production processes such as the release from sediments and algal activities. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that approximately 61% of the variance in DOM distribution might be explained by allochthonous/autochthonous carbon sources and predominant presence of either total nitrogen or total phosphorous over the other.

Phytoplankton abundance, dominance and coexistence in an eutrophic reservoir in the state of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The present study reports the phytoplankton abundance, dominance and co-existence relationships in the eutrophic Carpina reservoir, Pernambuco, Brazil. Sampling was carried out at six different depths bimonthly at a single reservoir spanning two climatic periods: dry season (January, September, and November 2006) and rainy season (March, May, and July 2006). Density, abundance, dominance, specific diversity and equitability of the community were determined, along with chlorophyll a, and physical and chemical variables of the environment. Eight species were considered abundant, and their densities corresponded to more than 90% of the total phytoplankton community quantified. Cyanobacteria represented more than 80% of this density. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the only dominant taxon in the dry season, and was co-dominant in the rainy season. C. raciborskii, Planktothrix agardhii and Geitlerinema amphibium had the greatest densities and lowest vertical variation coefficients. The statistical analysis indicated relationships with vertical and seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community and the following variables: total dissolved solids, water temperature, electrical conductivity and pH. The changes in the environmental variables were discrete and regulated by the establishment of precipitation however, they were able to promote vertical and seasonal instability in the structure of the phytoplankton community.					de L.

Brown Trout Removal Effects on Short-Term Survival and Movement of Myxobolus cerebralis-Resistant Rainbow Trout	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Following establishment of Myxobolus cerebralis (the parasite responsible for salmonid whirling disease) in Colorado, populations of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss experienced significant declines, whereas Brown Trout Salmo trutta densities increased in many locations across the state, potentially influencing the success of M. cerebralis-resistant Rainbow Trout reintroductions. We examined the effects of Brown Trout removal on the short-term (3-month) survival and movement of two crosses of reintroduced, M. cerebralis-resistant Rainbow Trout in the Cache la Poudre River, Colorado. Radio frequency identification passive integrated transponder tags and antennas were used to track movements of wild Brown Trout and stocked Rainbow Trout in reaches where Brown Trout had or had not been removed. Multistate mark-recapture models were used to estimate tagged fish apparent survival and movement in these sections 3 months following Brown Trout removal. A cross between the German Rainbow Trout and Colorado River Rainbow Trout strains exhibited similar survival and movement probabilities in the reaches, suggesting that the presence of Brown Trout did not affect its survival or movement. However, a cross between the German Rainbow Trout and Harrison Lake Rainbow Trout exhibited less movement from the reach in which Brown Trout had been removed. Despite this, the overall short-term benefits of the removal were equivocal, suggesting that Brown Trout removal may not be beneficial for the reintroduction of Rainbow Trout. Additionally, the logistical constraints of conducting removals in large river systems are substantial and may not be a viable management option in many rivers.					; Fetherman, Eric/AAZ-7045-2020; Bailey, Larissa/ABH-3513-2020	Schisler, George/0000-0001-6948-6991; Fetherman, Eric/0000-0003-4792-7148													0002-8487	1548-8659					2015	144	3					610	626		10.1080/00028487.2015.1007166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1007166													WOS:000355472800015

We conducted a preliminary survey of the macroinvertebrate fauna of Tibetan streams in June 2009 and August 2011 and compared streams with different water sources. We collected quantitative samples of macroinvertebrates and measured physicochemical variables at 16 sites (8 each sampling year) at altitudes ranging from 4315 to 5065 m a.s.l. and grouped the sites into 3 types according to origin: glacier-fed, rain-fed, and lake-outlets. We identified 38 taxa, with a mean of 8.9 taxa per site. Overall the benthic fauna was dominated by insects (71%), mainly Diptera (especially Chironomidae). Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera were found at nearly all sites but mostly in low numbers; however, the fauna was significantly different in the 2 sampling years, especially due to the proportions of Chironomidae (68% in June 2009 and 10% in August 2011) and Baetidae (6% vs. 35%, respectively). The 3 stream types had significantly different faunas. Rain-fed streams had the highest total taxon richness (gamma-diversity), but glacier-fed streams had a slightly higher taxon turnover rate (beta-diversity). Percent glacial cover in the catchment and water turbidity explained most of the variability in taxon richness. Although not particularly taxon rich compared to other high-altitude streams, the Tibetan stream fauna showed considerable spatial variability. The fast retreat of the glaciers and permanent snow fields in Tibet makes further studies on distribution patterns and driving forces for aquatic biodiversity urgent.

The genus includes toxic and nontoxic species/strains, and they show competitive succession in natural environments that is not well understood. Here we show the effects of microcystin production on species competitiveness when cultured under different conditions. When phosphate is rich, toxic Microcystis grew faster than nontoxic Microcystis. However, phosphate limitation significantly promoted photosynthesis of nontoxic Microcystis. Under phosphate limitation, toxic Microcystis was more sensitive than nontoxic Microcystis, and the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETR(max)) of nontoxic Microcystis was significantly higher than that of toxic Microcystis. Significantly higher light quantum efficiencies suggested that nontoxic Microcystis was more competitive than toxic Microcystis (P < 0.05) under light limitation. When in high light, the ratio of closed Photosystem II (PSII) to total PSII was higher and more sensitive to light in nontoxic than toxic Microcystis. Intense non-photochemical quenching (qN) was induced by high light for toxic Microcystis, while there was a serious limitation of qN formation leading to photoinhibition in nontoxic strains. Deconvolution of qN composition suggested that lots of qN(s) (slow component of qN) production might be caused by a reversible photoinhibition mechanism for toxic Microcystis. These observations suggest a photosynthetic explanation for bloom succession in which in early stages of the bloom, high phosphate concentration favours the rapid growth of toxic Microcystis. Subsequent bloom formation would lead to the decrease of water transparency and phosphate concentration that then promotes dominance of nontoxic Microcystis.					; Li, Dunhai/F-8851-2012	Li, Dunhai/0000-0002-1915-4216; 													0031-8884	2330-2968					2015	54	6					640	648		10.2216/15-79.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/15-79.1													WOS:000365995200010

A total of seventy six eels were obtained seasonally and the total size and weight were measured. Tissue samples were analyzed for heavy metals by ICP/OES Optima 2000-Perkin Elmer. Our results indicated that iron had the highest concentrations in the muscle, gill and liver, followed by zinc, aluminum, copper, manganese, nickel. Considering all the samples, metal concentrations were significantly higher in the liver than in the muscle except for Mn, Ni, Al and Cr which were preferentially accumulated in the gill. In European eel, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn concentrations were significantly different among tissues, but Cu and Zn were observed higher in individuals obtained from Dalyan sampling point. In Namnam River sampling point, eel muscles were also highly contaminated by Mn, in contrast to eel muscles from Koycegiz Lake sampling point with the lowest levels. In this study, Cd and Pb accumulations were higher than the limits for fish proposed by Turkish Food Codex and European Union Regulation. According to our results, eels inhabiting Kelycegiz Lagoon were associated with enhanced metal content in their muscle tissue and were not safe within the limits for human consumption.

Planktonic nitrogen fixation in Lake Malawi/Nyasa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nitrogen (N-2) fixation has been identified as possibly an important source of "new" nitrogen (N) to the epilimnion of Lake Malawi but studies in 1999-2000 and 2002 (September-December) estimated that the contribution of N-2-fixation by heterocystous Anabaena filaments to the N budget of the lake's epilimnion is only 3-4% of total N input. N-2-fixation rates in Lake Malawi, as estimated by the acetylene reduction assay were higher during the stratified season (September-March) than during the rest of the year. Planktonic N-2-fixation in Lake Malawi can be monitored by measuring heterocyst biovolume concentrations because a significant correlation (r(2)supercript stop = 0.945, P < 0.0001) was observed between the two parameters. Heterocyst density cannot be used to estimate N-2-fixation because heterocyst sizes in the lake change continuously as at least two Anabaena species with different heterocyst dimensions are present. During September-October 2002, a species similar to A. maxima, contained larger heterocysts (16.34 +/- 2.46 and 13.25 +/- 1.89 mu m in cross and apical section dimensions, respectively). In November-December of 2002, A. discoidea dominated and had smaller sized heterocysts (8.92 +/- 1.13 and 7.25 +/- 0.95 mu m in cross and apical section dimensions). Since planktonic N-2-fixation is higher near shore than offshore, its contribution to the N budget in the littoral zone where high densities of grazing benthic fish occur may be more critical to maintaining the high rates of benthic algal productivity observed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2008	596						251	267		10.1007/s10750-007-9101-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9101-6													WOS:000251729800022

Phytoplankton diversity (alpha, beta, and gamma) from the Araguaia River tropical floodplain lakes (central Brazil)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Alpha, beta and gamma are three components of species diversity. Knowing these attributes in floodplain lake phytoplankton communities is vital when selecting conservation areas. Species diversity is commonly used with other taxonomic groups, but rarely with phytoplankton. We compared the number of phytoplankton species (alpha diversity) from 21 Middle Araguaia River floodplain lakes in the 2000 and 2001 rainy and dry seasons. From these samples we estimated complete survey species richness (gamma diversity), quantified differences in species composition between lakes (beta diversity) and assessed the influence of abiotic variables on beta diversity. We recorded a total of 577 taxa. The Sjack1 estimator indicated that 62.31% of taxa were sampled in the 2000 rainy and 67.65% dry seasons, and 68.36% in the 2001 rainy and 73.5% dry seasons. In almost all seasons, alpha diversity negatively correlated with latitude. Beta diversity (beta-1) was higher in high water periods, especially in 2000. This may have been caused by isolated heavy rainfall, which would have increased environmental heterogeneity and raised beta diversity. DCA showed differences in phytoplankton composition between rainy and dry seasons in 2000 and 2001, reflecting the influence of flood pulses on phytoplankton composition. The Mantel test indicated spatial distribution patterns where geographically more distant lakes had less-similar phytoplankton communities.

A brief survey of about one hundred years of varve research demonstrates the long history of dating and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on varved lake sediments. Considering methodologies, this review confines to some main principles and fundamental requirements for varve studies. The factors favouring varve deposition and preservation in lacustrine systems and consequences for the occurrence of long varved profiles axe thoroughly discussed. The concept of varve micro-facies describes the main varve types and their relation to climatic regimes and environmental conditions. The palaeoclimatic relevance of varved lake sediments is reflected in a large variety of different proxy data. These are discussed under a more general aspect including the pathways of climatic signals into the sediment with special emphasis on the interpretation of varve thickness. Two case studies demonstrate the value of varve micro-facies analyses for obtaining a complex picture of changes in seasonality of past climates.																			1437-028X		3-540-20601-9				2004							109	127																WOS:000222026200007
J	Shiau, JT; Wu, PS				Shiau, Jenq-Tzong; Wu, Pei-Syun			Nonstationary Distributional Changes of Annual Rainfall Indices in Taiwan	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The purpose of this study is to detect alterations of annual rainfall regime in terms of distributional changes of rainfall indices in Taiwan. A total of nine rainfall indices at eight stations with at least 72-year daily records are used to characterize annual rainfall regime. The generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) is adopted for dynamically detecting evolution of probability distributions of these indices. The results indicate that alterations of annual rainfall regime are spatial diverse and no prevalent distributional changes are observed. Approximate half indices (35/72) exhibit stationarity and WRR (wet-season rainfall ratio) is the least-affected index since only two stations (Sunmoon Lake and Chengkung) revealing nonstationarity. On the contrary, PRCPTOT (annual total rainfall), SDII (simple daily intensity index), and ADD (annual dry days) are high-affected indices due to 75% of stations exhibiting nonstationarity. Highly affected stations include Taipei, Hengchun, and Dawu because two (WRR and CRX (maximum consecutive rainfall)), one (WRR), and one (WRR) indices classified as stationarity, respectively. Taichung and Sunmoon Lake are least-affected stations since 7 out of 9 indices revealing stationarity. These facts indicate that annual rainfall regime of central-west Taiwan is less affected, and north and southeastern regions are change-prone regions.

Increased Accumulation of Sulfur in Lake Sediments of the High Arctic	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report a synchronous increase in accumulation of reduced inorganic sulfur since c. 1980 in sediment cores from eight of nine lakes studied in the Canadian Arctic and Svalbard (Norway). Sediment incubations and detailed analyses of sediment profiles from two of the lakes indicate that increases in sulfur accumulation may be due ultimately to a changing climate. Warming-induced lengthening of the ice-free season is resulting in well-documented increases in algal production and sedimentation of the resulting detrital matter. Algal detritus is a rich source of labile carbon, which in these sediments stimulates dissimilatory sulfate reduction. The sulfide produced is stored in sediment (as acid volatile sulfide), converted to other forms of sulfur, or reoxidized to sulfate and lost to the water column. An acceleration of the sulfur cycle in Arctic lakes could have profound effects on important biogeochemical processes, such as carbon burial and mercury methylation.					; Canfield, Don/C-1735-2012; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008	Lamborg, Carl/0000-0003-4379-3904; Canfield, Don/0000-0001-7602-8366; Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; Boyle, John/0000-0002-1172-1079; Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334; Drevnick, Paul/0000-0003-2843-9720; 													0013-936X					NOV 15	2010	44	22					8415	8421		10.1021/es101991p	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es101991p								20973547					WOS:000284248300011

In particular, anadromous fish species, which necessarily migrate to fresh water to reproduce, are endangered since many are no longer able to reach their natural spawning sites. In addition, pollution of rivers effectively prevents upstream or downstream movements and blocks access to spawning grounds. This article investigates how poor water quality interferes with the life history cycle of twaite shad Alosa fallax fallax (Lacepede, 1803), an anadromous clupeid fish, in the watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted environment in West Europe. We used two models based on known ecological and environmental information to explain past and present twaite shad distribution within the watershed and to make inferences about a future population recovery and juvenile habitat value. We demonstrated that historical spawning areas satisfy water quality conditions necessary to support spawning and successful development of early life history stages of the twaite shad. However, poor water quality conditions just upstream the freshwater-saltwater boundary still act as an effective migration barrier for upstream movement. As a consequence, spawning grounds are inaccessible and the population is dominated by seasonal adults occurring in the lower estuarine part of the watershed. This article provides testable and diagnostic information to the watershed management in that it identifies habitat and water quality requirements needed to support the expected recovery of an endangered anadromous fish population.					; Maes, Joachim/ABG-8549-2020	Maes, Joachim/0000-0002-8272-1607; Stevens, Maarten/0000-0003-2251-2878													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2008	602						129	143		10.1007/s10750-008-9279-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9279-2													WOS:000254088800011

Advances in satellite remote sensing, particularly the Joint Research Centre's Global Surface Water (JRC-GSW) dataset derived from Landsat imagery, provide an unprecedented opportunity for high-resolution and long-term analysis of SWBs spatio-temporal dynamics. This study leverages the JRC-GSW dataset to assess the impacts of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on SWBs in the Dongting Lake region, focusing on maximum and minimum water extents during wet and dry seasons pre- and post-dam impoundment. Results reveal significant shrinkage and fragmentation of water bodies post-TGD, particularly during the dry season and predominantly in the northwest region. The number and total area of SWBs increased post-TGD by 16%-83% and 17%-28%, respectively, accompanied by intensified seasonal variability. Enhanced fragmentation was especially pronounced during the dry season. Weak correlations between water body dynamics and hydrometeorological factors highlight the dominant influence of anthropogenic activities, particularly dam operations, in shaping these patterns. These findings emphasize the importance of high-resolution, long-term satellite data in monitoring SWBs dynamics and inform sustainable water resource management and biodiversity conservation in regions affected by large-scale infrastructure projects.

Seasonal baseline of nutrients and stable isotopes in a saline lake of Argentina: biogeochemical processes and river runoff effects	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The seasonal variability of inorganic and organic nutrients and stable isotopes and their relations with plankton and environmental conditions were monitored in Lake Chasico. Principal component analysis evidenced the strong influence of the river runoff on several biogeochemical variables. Silicate concentrations were controlled by diatom biomass and river discharge. Higher values of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) indicated agricultural uses in the river basin. Elevated pH values (similar to 9) inhibiting nitrification in the lake explained partially the dominance of ammonium: similar to 83 % of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The low DIN/SRP ratio inferred nitrogen limitation, although the hypotheses of iron and CO2 limitation are relevant in alkaline lakes. Particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were mainly of autochthonous origin. The main allochthonous input was imported by the river as POM owning to the arid conditions. Dissolved organic carbon was likely top-down regulated by the bacterioplankton grazer Brachionus plicatilis. The delta C-13 signature was a good indicator of primary production and its values were influenced probably by CO2 limitation. The delta N-15 did not evidence nitrogen fixation and suggested the effects of anthropogenic activities. The preservation of a good water quality in the lake is crucial for resource management.

After addition of the substrates Carbokalk and straw a neutral sediment layer formed, in which microbial sulfate and iron reduction as well as sulfide precipitation occurred. The net rate of neutralization was limited by the precipitation of iron sulfides rather than by microbial reactions. Oxidation of H2S by ferric iron in the anoxic sediment lowered the net sulfate reduction rate. Seasonal fluctuations of iron sulfides in the sediment showed that the reaction products were not necessarily stable. The long-term success of the approach depends on the net partition of the precipitated iron-(mono-/di-) sulfide that is permanently buried in the anoxic sediment. It could be shown by field experiments that the long-term success of the neutralization depends on the spatial scale and duration of the experiments. Volumes from 26 to 4500 m(3), exposition times from 4 months to 5 years, and increasingly thick coverings of the sediments with straw, from zero to 40 cm, were used. Net neutralization rates decreased from 41 meq m(-2) d(-1) in laboratory microcosms to a mean rate of 2.3 meq m(-2) d(-1) in the 4500 m(3) field experiment. The results show that the success of the microbial treatment of acid pit lakes lastly depends on the limnological conditions in the lake that cannot be simulated by upscaling of simple laboratory experiments.

However, the distribution of wetland categories is characterized as spatially heterogeneous and highly dynamic. It remains a challenge to fuse the inherent characteristics of optical and SAR data by exploiting their discriminative feature representations for delineating wetland landscapes. To fully integrate the complementary information among optical and SAR data, a dual-branch deep network is proposed for mapping hierarchical wetland characteristics, which is referred to as HiWet-DBNet. Within the network, two parallel branches are designed to collaboratively learn the spatial, spectral or polarized, and temporal dependencies in the optical image and SAR image time series, respectively. Inspired by the relationships of deep and shallow features, the intra-layer features are fused across the branches to generate the multi-level wetland mapping results (i.e., general wetland land cover, and wetland vegetation types). The proposed method was tested on the Poyang Lake wetland in China using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The evaluation results show that the overall accuracy of HiWet-DBNet reaches 88.51% and 88.61% in the dry and wet seasons, which is superior to the other solutions with only a single data source or insufficient fusion of multi-modal features.

However, the micro-eukaryotic communities (MECs) in thermokarst lakes are not well studied. Employing 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed the biogeography of MECs and their driving factors in sediments of thermokarst lakes across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Results showed that Diatom, Gastrotricha, Nematozoa, Ciliophora, and Cercozoa were dominant lineages in relative abundance and OTU richness. MECs varied substantially across the lakes in terms of diversity and composition. Structural equation modeling and mantel test showed that both OTU richness and community structure of MECs had close relationships with spatial factors, climatic factors, and sediment properties, particularly with latitude, mean annual precipitation, pH, as well as nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios. Moreover, different groups of microbial eukaryotes (taxonomic groups and co-occurrence modules) responded differentially to the measured environmental variables. The results suggested that the biogeography of sediment MECs of thermokarst lakes on the QTP were jointly controlled by spatial and climatic factors as well as sediment properties. This study provides the first view of the composition, diversity, and underlying drivers of MECs dynamic in surface sediments of thermokarst lakes across the QTP.

However, there is a lack of in-depth research that accurately depicts underwater topography and coupleing hydrodynamics to establish the reproduction and migration mechanisms of phytoplankton, especially in seasonal ice-covered lakes. A typical seasonally ice-covered lake, Lake Chagan, was selected, and 164 water column and plankton samples were collected in 2023. An integrated underwater topographic-hydrodynamic model was constructed based on topographic data from 597 exploration points and long-term hydrological and meteorological observational data. The dominant algal species and their three-dimensional distribution and succession processes during different periods were studied in detail. The effects of topographic factors (relief, surface curvature, water depth, slope gradient, roughness, and slope aspect) on the hydrodynamic field and phytoplankton distribution were discussed. The results showed that the phytoplankton species diversity was higher in the bottom water column during the non-ice-covered period (March to October). The dominant species of phytoplankton varied with seasons, with diatoms dominating in the ice- covered period and harmful phytoplankton such as cyanobacteria in the non-ice-covered period. The biomass and biomass density of cyanobacteria were also higher than those of other phytoplankton. Phytoplankton species diversity and richness indices in the surface water column had a significant combined effect on the entire lake ecosystem. Surface curvature and slope gradient were the main factors affecting flow velocity during the non-ice- covered period (p <= 0.05, r =-0.58 and- 0.62), directly affecting the spatial distribution of cyanobacterial biomass (p <= 0.05, r = 0.65; p <= 0.01, r =-0.71). Therefore, attention should be paid to the surface curvature and slope of the sediment when controlling cyanobacterial blooms via by sediment dredging. These studies explored the behavior of phytoplankton in response to their fluid environment from a combined biological and physical-dynamic perspective and provided an effective reference for the water environment management of seasonal ice-covered lakes with harmful algal blooms.

Using forensic geochemistry via fish otoliths to investigate an illegal fish introduction	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Illegal fish introductions create some of the most challenging problems for resource managers because of their potential to harm existing recreational fisheries and their impact on species of conservation concern. Determining the origin of a suspected illegal fish introduction can aid managers in preventing the colonization and subsequent ecosystem impacts of introduced species. In this study, we used forensic geochemistry via fish otoliths to investigate an illegal walleye (Sander vitreus) introduction in Swan Lake, Montana, which provides critical habitat for threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). Core to edge geochemical profiles of Sr-87/Sr-86 and Sr/Ca ratios in the walleye otoliths revealed that these fish had been introduced to Swan Lake within the past growing season, and their geochemical signature matched that of walleye sampled from Lake Helena, Montana, located 309 road kilometres away. This research highlights application of a tool fisheries managers can use to identify the natal waterbody source of illegally introduced fish.

Here, we evaluate the ability of the Lakeshore Capacity Model (LCM), developed for Precambrian Shield lakes, to assess the impact of cottage development on the trophic status of ten Georgian Bay embayments. The LCM could only be applied to eight embayments due to the large size and complexity of two watersheds and produced unacceptably high estimates of mean seasonal total phosphorus concentrations ([TP]; i.e., exceeded 20% of measured values for five of eight embayments); accuracy of [TP] estimates could not be improved by accounting for internal phosphorus loading. We developed an additional model, the Anthro-Geomorphic Model (AGM), which uses building density and basin morphometry as variables. Estimates of [TP] for the AGM were within 20% of measured values for all sites. Compared with other aquatic systems, coastal embayments of Georgian Bay have significantly higher chlorophyll a concentrations per unit [TP]; we suggest that the TP-chlorophyll relationship presented in this study be used to estimate productivity in these systems.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2018	75	11					1798	1810		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0095													WOS:000448334800004
J	Yilmaz, N				Yilmaz, Nese			Assesment of seasonal variation of phytoplankton and related water quality parameters of Sazlidere Dam Lake (Istanbul, Turkey)	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The seasonal variation of phytoplankton community and affecting some physico chemical factors of Sazlidere Dam Lake were investigated monthly from December 2003 to November 2005. Phytoplankton was constituted of Bacillariophyta, Charophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Cyanobacteria, Euglenozoa, Miozoa and Ochrophyta members. According to the functional group aproach, the phytoplankton community of the dam lake was formed by 19 groups (B, D, N, P, T, S2, X1, Y, E, F, J, H1, L-O, L-M, M, MP, R, W1 and W2) which were most common in mesotrophic and eutrophic waters. The seasonal variations of phytoplankton were most affected by light, temperature and nutrients. A highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.667) existed between phytoplankton density and orthophosphate concentrations. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index ranged from 0.035 to 1.059, Simpson dominance index changed between 0.096 and 0.973. According to regulations for the water quality of potable waters in Turkey, Sazlidere Dam is of class I in terms of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and orthophosphate concentrations. Chlorophyll-a concentrations (5.47-57.0mg/m(3)) showed that the lake has eutrophic characteristics. When the physicochemical and biologic features of the lake were evaluated, it was determined that the Sazlidere Reservoir showed a change towards from oligotrophic to mesotrophic characteristics.

Thus, understanding the evolution and dynamics of supraglacial lakes is important to provide improved parameterizations for ice sheet models to enable better projections of future GrIS changes. In this study, we utilize the growing inventory of optical and microwave satellite imagery to automatically determine the fate of Greenland-wide supraglacial lakes during 2018 and 2019; low and high melt seasons respectively. We develop a novel time series classification method to categorize lakes into four classes: (a) Refreezing, (b) rapidly draining, (c) slowly draining, and (d) buried. Our findings reveal significant interannual variability between the two melt seasons, with a notable increase in the proportion of draining lakes, and a particular dominance of slowly draining lakes, in 2019. We also find that as mean lake depth increases, so does the percentage of lakes that drain, indicating that lake depth may influence hydrofracture potential. We further observe rapidly draining lakes at higher elevations than the previously hypothesized upper-elevation hydrofracture limit (1,600 m), and that non-draining lakes are generally deeper during the lower melt 2018 season. Our automatic classification approach and the resulting 2-year ice-sheet-wide data set provide new insights into GrIS supraglacial lake dynamics and evolution, offering a valuable resource for future research.					; Subramanian, Aneesh/D-9484-2017; Subramanian, Aneesh/AFP-8577-2022; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018	Hossain, Emam/0000-0002-6422-1895; Subramanian, Aneesh/0000-0001-7805-0102; Dunmire, Devon/0000-0001-6299-9137; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X														2333-5084				FEB	2025	12	2							e2024EA003793	10.1029/2024EA003793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EA003793													WOS:001410406600001

Comparison of Methods to Derive the Height-Area Relationship of Shallow Lakes in West Africa Using Remote Sensing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In West Africa, lakes and reservoirs play a vital role as they are critical resources for drinking water, livestock, irrigation, and fisheries. Given the scarcity of in-situ data, satellite remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring lake volume changes in this region. Several methods have been developed to do this using water height-area-volume relationships, but few publications have compared their performances over small and medium-sized shallow lakes. In this work we compare four methods based on recent data from high-resolution optical imagery and radar and lidar altimetry over 16 lakes in the Central Sahel, with areas between 0.22 km2 ${\text{km}}<^>{2}$ and 21 km2 ${\text{km}}<^>{2}$. All methods show consistent results and are generally in good agreement with in-situ data in terms of accuracy (Root Mean Squared Error below 0.42 m for heights and Normalized Root Mean Squared Error below 13% for volumes). The precision of the estimated water height is about 0.20 m for Pleiades Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and less than 0.13 m for the other methods. Inherent limitations such as DSM quality, temporal coverage of DSM and lidar data, and spatial coverage of radar altimetry data are identified. Overall, fine shape patterns are consistently observed over small height amplitudes, highlighting the ability to monitor shallow lakes with non-linear height-area relationship. Finally, we show that combining lidar and radar altimetry-based methods provides estimates of volume changes over the different water bodies of the study region accurate enough to monitor seasonal, interannual, and long-term variability.

To enhance water resource utilization and facilitate reclamation from domestic sewage, substantial global efforts have focused on developing systematic management strategies and advanced technologies for treatment and resource recovery. This study examines and presents the case of domestic sewage reclamation and water reuse in the rural Hangjiahu region, situated on the southern bank of Taihu Lake in Northern Zhejiang Province, Eastern China. It provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art technologies implemented in the region. In rural areas, sewage treatment is decentralized and involves two primary streams: one where urine is separately disinfected and sterilized, with feces processed into agricultural fertilizer; and another where greywater undergoes bio-composting and wetland treatment to produce recycled water. Additionally, natural rainwater is collected and stored in ponds, enhancing the region's water resources. The results demonstrate that the integration of domestic sewage reclamation and rainwater storage has effectively mitigated the risks of flooding during rainy seasons and water shortages during droughts. Remarkably, no severe floods or droughts have occurred in the region since 1991, contrasting with historical records from 1909 to 1954, when such events were frequent. This study underscores the potential for replicating these approaches in other regions facing similar challenges.

Study focus: Lakes play a crucial role in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which focuses on water-related ecosystems. Here, we devised a methodology to estimate Dongting Lake water storage and analyze their dynamic changes for monitoring SDG 6.6.1 from 2001 to 2020. This study not only provide a geospatial perspective for monitoring water storage for SDG 6.6.1 under the climate oscillations and human impacts in a large floodplain lake but also provide an important scientific basis for improving the optimal allocation of water resources of the Dongting Lake area. New hydrological insights: Remote sensing data are preferable for establishing water storage models during dry seasons, whereas water level is more reliable during wet seasons. Over the past 20 years, average annual water storage in the lake regions has displayed relatively stable fluctuations with an upward trend since 2015. During the wet season, East Dongting Lake has the largest storage capacity, while most of the water resources are concentrated in South Dongting Lake during the dry season. The water storage deviation reached up to 20 %, with a notable negative deviation of more than 10 % during 2011-2015 caused by a severe drought. Related to the stable operation of the Three Gorges Project and the conservation policy initiated by the Chinese government, Dongting Lake is in a stable and recovery period.

The SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model is utilized to investigate the effect of future climate scenarios. This study focused on two climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) with three GCMs (GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC, and IPSL-CM5A-MR) and their impact on the hydrological process and extremes in the Sen River Basin, the largest tributary of the TSL basin. The annual precipitation, surface runoff, lateral flow, groundwater flow, and total water yield are projected to decrease in both the near-future (2020-2040) and mid-future period (2050-2070), while actual evapotranspiration is projected to increase by 3.3% and 5.3%. Monthly precipitation is projected to increase by 11.2% during the rainy season and decrease by 7.5% during the dry season. Two climate models (GISS and IPSL model) lead to decreases in 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day maximum flows and minimum flows flow. Thus, the prediction results depend on the climate model used.

Bottom-up regulation of bacterial growth in tropical phytotelm bromeliads	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Evaluating the factors that regulate bacterial growth in natural ecosystems is a major goal of modern microbial ecology. Phytotelm bromeliads have been used as model ecosystems in aquatic ecology as they provide many independent replicates in a small area and often encompass a wide range of limnological conditions. However, as far as we know, there has been no attempt to evaluate the main regulatory factors of bacterial growth in these aquatic ecosystems. Here, we used field surveys to evaluate the main bottom-up factors that regulate bacterial growth in the accumulated water of tank bromeliads. Bacterial production, water temperature, water color, chlorophyll-a, and nutrient concentrations were determined for 147 different tank bromeliads in two different samplings. Bromeliad position and the season of sampling were also noted. Bacterial production was explained by ion ammonium concentration and water temperature, but the total variance explained was low (r(2) = 0.104). Sampling period and bromeliad position were included in additional models that gave empirical support for predicting bacterial production. Bromeliad water tanks are extremely variable aquatic ecosystems in space (among bromeliads) and time (environmental conditions can change within hours), and it is well known that bacterial production responds rapidly to environmental change. Therefore, we concluded that several factors could independently regulate bacterial growth in phytotelm bromeliads depending on the characteristics of each bromeliad, such as location, amount of detritus, and ambient nutrient concentrations. A clear bottom-up limitation pattern of bacterial production in tropical phytotelm bromeliads was not found.

Validation of landscape suitability indices for Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) in the US Great Lakes region	CONDOR												Remotely sensed land cover data enable characterization of avian habitat over large spatial scales, which can be applied to regional conservation planning. Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) have been declining in the U.S. Great Lakes region for decades. Although causes of the decline are not well understood, habitat loss and degradation are viewed as major barriers to recovery. The Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture, a partnership for bird conservation in the Upper Midwest, developed a landscape suitability index for the wetland-breeding Black Tern based on remotely sensed land cover to choose habitat to enhance or restore. We tested the validity of this index and compared it to an alternative index we constructed from results of field surveys. Over 2 breeding seasons, we surveyed for presence of Black Tern breeding colonies in 158 wetlands across the Great Lakes region and compared our findings with predictions of the existing index. We used our first season of surveys, numerous remotely sensed landscape variables, and random forest classification to build our alternative index. Key predictors of Black Tern colony presence in the alternative index were wetland area, wetland type (emergent vegetation, open water, or combination), and area of wetlands available for foraging within 2 km. The 2 indices performed similarly well, correctly identifying categories of sites most likely to host Black Terns, but even high-suitability sites had <20% predicted occupancy probability. The best use of these and similar indices is in prioritizing restoration projects at a regional scale by identifying sites with potential for use.

The purpose of this study was to obtain information about the early life history of lake sturgeon, determine the extent and duration of lake sturgeon larval drift, and examine this relationship to water flow and temperature in the Upper Black River, Michigan. This study also compares the results of other studies to further evaluate the dispersion of larvae. Larval production was quantified using drift nets anchored to the stream bottom from May to June in 2000-2002. Larval drift nets captured 780 larvae in 2000; 2975 larvae in 2001; and 2041 larvae in 2002. For the 2000, 2001, and 2002 spawning season, we estimated that 7107 (95% CL: +/- 1470), 17 409 (95% CL: +/- 5163), and 15 820 (95% CL: +/- 3168) larval lake sturgeon were produced in the Upper Black River (UBR), respectively. Catch per unit effort values of drifting larvae were greatest after peak water flows, with most larvae captured in the middle of the river channel. A mean daily water temperature above 16 degrees C was an important environmental stimulus that influenced peak larval dispersion away from spawning sites. The results of this study suggested that natural reproduction was still occurring in the Black Lake system.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				JUN	2005	21	3					161	168		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2005.00623.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2005.00623.x													WOS:000229519300001

Letizia; Rossi, Loreto; Fazi, Stefano; Rossi, David			Detritus accumulation and decomposition in a coastal lake (Acquatina-southern Italy)	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Knowledge about processes and dynamics underlying organic matter accumulation in transitional waters is crucial for the protection of these ecologically important coastal habitats. This study investigated the relationship between large particle accumulation and decomposition in a coastal lake included in a Site of Community Interest (SCI) using sediment trap and litterbag techniques. 2. Two sets of sediment traps were deployed at five sites along the longitudinal axis of the lake. One set was emptied once a month for 12 months, and the other twice a year. The contents of the monthly and the 6-monthly traps and the superficial sediments were then compared to estimate the organic matter accumulation and loss. To determine the mass loss rate of the three major allochthonous sources of detritus (the reed Phragmites australis, the cordgrass Spartina juncea, and the seagrass Posidonia oceanica), litterbags were placed near the sediment traps at three out of the five sites at the beginning of each 6-month period and retrieved monthly. 3. The amount of annual particulate organic matter (POM) deposition in the traps was 1320.2 +/- 58.5 g m(-2) y(-1) and consisted of 25% large particles (CPOM). Allochthonous litter comprised an important fraction of CPOM, and its breakdown rate changed with the plant species, site and season. Loss rate of CPOM accumulated at the lake bottom was significantly related with the mass loss rate of reed and cordgrass litter, but not with that of seagrass. 4. Due to slow litter breakdown and tidal landward advection, the lake acted as a sediment trap for allochthonous matter, especially from Posidonia. The important role of marine-derived litter in organic matter sedimentation suggests addressing conservation strategies of the lake functioning towards the selective control of allochthonous CPOM inputs, in particular at the mouth where the incoming tide brings suspended material and salinity decelerates matter flow to the sea and decomposition. This study supports the hypothesis that sedimentation and decomposition dynamics are important factors for coastal lake evolution, and shows litterbag and sediment trap techniques as simple useful investigation tools in management strategies aiming at conserving transitional waters.

The predominant cyanobacteria were species of Rivularia, which formed conspicuous colonies throughout the year. Seasonally, other species were abundant: Schizothrix fasciculata, Tolypothrix distorta and Phormidium splendidum. All the species collected produced microcystins to a varying degree (up to five varieties), while the benthic community as a whole produced concentrations as high as 20.45 mg m(-2). At the same time, the presence of microcystins dissolved in water was confirmed. Among environmental variables, air temperature and silicate content were positively and strongly correlated with total microcystins, while nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate, calcium and flow were negatively correlated with them. Dissolved microcystins were negatively correlated with microcystin LR, P.A.R. and total phosphorus and positively with rainfall. The production of microcystin YR seems to be regulated by different factors from those regulating the other main varieties (microcystin LR and microcystin RR). The data obtained indicate that all the tested benthic cyanobacteria produced microcystins in this shallow calcareous stream, which may contribute to their predominance in the prevailing conditions. The accumulation of microcystins in mucilaginous colonies of other groups of algae poses new questions concerning the possible ecological function of these compounds and needs further study.

This research involved investigating three lakes in the Inner Mongolia segment of the Yellow River basin during frozen and unfrozen periods in two habitats: water bodies and sediments. The research examined the composition and function of bacteria, archaea, and fungi across different times and habitats within the basin, their response to environmental variables in water and sediment, and inter-domain interactions between bacteria-archaea and bacteria-fungi were compared using interdomain ecological network (IDEN). The findings indicate significant variations in the structures of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities across different periods and habitats, with the pH of the water body being a crucial environmental variable affecting microbial community composition. In the frozen period, the functionality of microbial communities, especially in terms of energy metabolism, was significantly impacted, with water bodies experiencing more pronounced effects than sediments. Archaea and fungi significantly contribute to the stability of bacterial communities across various habitats, especially in ice-covered conditions, where stronger associations between bacterial communities, archaea, and fungi promote the microbial communities' adaptability to cold stress. Furthermore, our results indicate that the primary environmental variable influencing the structure of IDENs is the nutrient salt content in both water bodies and sediments. This study broadens our understanding of the responses and feedback mechanisms of inter-domain microbial interactions in lakes influenced by seasonal ice cover.

A significant relationship between these nutrient's removal from the system and reduction in pCO(2)(water) was observed (with few exceptions). These water bodies acted as significant sources of CO2 in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons despite having substantial quantity of chlorophyll-a to make it a net autotrophic system. The study revealed that if conditions favourable for optimum photosynthesis can be maintained in these ponds, the CO2 source character of these ponds can be reversed. In the post-monsoon season, when the pH of the water column was high, the system acted as sink for CO2 which suggests the use of lime to prevent these systems from becoming hypereutrophic and carbon source at the same time.					; Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sourav/AAD-6507-2022; Samanta, Sourav/JJD-6621-2023; Das, Sourav/AAG-2024-2020; Chanda, Abhra/AAM-7909-2020; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban/HNJ-2332-2023	Samanta, Sourav/0000-0003-0756-8662; Bhattacharyya, Dr. Sourav/0000-0002-3199-3717; Chanda, Abhra/0000-0002-3280-1959; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban/0000-0003-3340-6202													1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2020	34	2					259	273		10.1111/wej.12459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12459													WOS:000531325200010

This activity generates various types of wastes that are dumped into the environment without prior treatment. In addition, there are contributions of its tributaries after leaching of agricultural and urban soils. All this contributes to the degradation of the water quality of this ecosystem. The aim of this study is to assess the level of trace elements contamination of the waters from the hydrosystem Lake Togo-Lagoon of Aneho and its spatio-seasonal variations. In the dry and rainy season, the physicochemical parameters of waters were measured according to French standards (AFNOR). The trace elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer coupled to a hydride and cold vapour generator. The spatial distribution was evaluated using maps which were performed by ordinary kriging interpolation method of ArcGIS 10.2.2 software. The results showed that the average dry season concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than those of the rainy season except that of Zn. The average concentrations (in mu g/l) observed for Cd: (39.28; 24.63), Pb: (216.82; 66.44), Cr: (197.00; 69.05) and Ni: (100.06; 66.50), respectively, in dry and rainy season were significantly higher than the WHO standards. However, overall trace elements contamination has been noted with polymetallic contamination indices which reached 4.14 in the dry season and 2.41 in the rainy season. This contamination is mainly of anthropogenic origin and comes from the intrusion of seawater loaded with phosphate effluents in the dry season and the leaching of mining and agricultural soils in the rainy season. The results proved that this lagoon ecosystem is polluted by trace elements mainly caused by phosphate mining. Thus, it deserves special attention for its better management for a sustainable development.					; Lazar, Iuliana/B-5974-2011; Lazar, Gabriel/A-4180-2010	Lazar, Iuliana Mihaela/0000-0002-9395-0130; OURO-SAMA, Kamilou/0000-0001-9220-7487; 													2523-3963	2523-3971				MAY	2020	2	5							811	10.1007/s42452-020-2593-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2593-7													WOS:000532834300028

A Synoptic Climatological Analysis of the Atmospheric Drivers of Water Clarity Variability in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Ahistorical water clarity index (K-d index or KDI) was developed through the use of satellite-derived and validated diffuse light attenuation (K-d; m(-1)) for each of the Great Lakes (and subbasins) on a daily level from 1998 to 2015. A statistical regionalization was performed with monthly level KDI using k-means clustering to subdivide the Great Lakes into regions with similar temporal variability in water clarity. The KDI was then used to assess the relationship between water clarity and atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge. An artificial neural-network-based self-organized map data reduction technique was used to classify atmospheric patterns using four atmospheric variables: mean sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential heights, zonal and meridional components of the wind at 10 m, and 850-hPa temperature. Stream discharge was found to have the strongest relationship with KDI, suggesting that sediments and dissolved matter from land runoffs are the key factors linking the atmosphere to water clarity in the Great Lakes. Although generally lower in magnitude than stream discharge, atmospheric circulation patterns associated with increased precipitation tended to have stronger positive correlations with KDI. With no long-range forecasts of stream discharge, the strong relationship between atmospheric circulation patterns and stream discharge may provide an avenue to more accurately model water clarity on a subseasonal-to-seasonal time scale.					; Lee, Cameron/GPP-3918-2022; Smith, Erik/K-4833-2019; Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021	Smith, Erik/0000-0002-8133-0348; Barnes, Brian/0000-0003-0056-3500; Sheridan, Scott/0000-0002-6928-6524													1558-8424	1558-8432				MAY	2020	59	5					915	935		10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0156.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0156.1													WOS:000568249700007

The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) is a species at risk of extinction. Its diet in freshwater environments has been scarcely studied in Mexico, despite its significance for managing populations and habitat. 2. The diet of Antillean manatees inhabiting the Natural Protected Area of Laguna de las Ilusiones, in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, was studied during the rainy season. 3. A microhistological analysis was conducted on 51 manatee faecal samples. The cuticle and epidermis of 35 plant species present in vegetation patches used as foraging grounds by the Antillean manatee were described. 4. In total, 223 plant fragments belonging to 11 families and 25 vascular plant taxa were identified. Echinochloa polystachya had the highest frequency (70.6%). Plant richness per faecal sample varied between one and eight plant species. 5. This manatee population feeds mainly on grass. The plant species found coincide with those reported in other studies on sirenian diets. However, 11 new plant species consumed by manatees were recorded. This is the most comprehensive study to date in river systems in Mexico on the botanical richness of manatee faeces. The information provided here can be applied to decision-making on the conservation of the Antillean manatee and its critical habitat.					; Olivera-Gómez, León/U-1179-2017; Olivera-Gomez, Leon David/U-1179-2017	Solano, Eloy/0000-0001-7742-2584; Olivera-Gomez, Leon David/0000-0002-8919-3835													1052-7613	1099-0755				AUG	2017	27	4					797	803		10.1002/aqc.2774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2774													WOS:000408335200008

Rather, the mix of urban hubs surrounded by undeveloped expanses creates a ratchet process whereby anthropogenic activity is sufficient to introduce and spread invaders, but for which the costs of monitoring and managing remote ecosystems is prohibitive. Elodea spp. is the first aquatic invasive plant to become established in Alaska and has potential for widespread deleterious ecological and economic impacts. A rapid eradication response with herbicides has been identified as a priority invasion control strategy. We conducted a multi-lake monitoring effort to assess collateral impacts from herbicide treatment for Elodea in high latitude systems. Variability in data was driven by seasonal dynamics and natural lake-to-lake differences typical of high latitude waterbodies, indicating lack of evidence for systematic impacts to water quality or plankton communities associated with herbicide treatment of Modal. Impacts on native macrophytes were benign with the exception of some evidence for earlier onset of leaf senescence for lily pads (Nuphar spp.) in treated lakes. We observed a substantial increase in detected native flora richness after Elodea was eradicated from the most heavily infested lake, indicating potential for retention of native macrophyte communities if infestations are addressed quickly. While avoiding introductions through prevention may be the most desirable outcome, these applications indicated low risks of non-target impacts associated with herbicide treatment as a rapid response option for Elodea in high latitude systems.					; Carey, Michael/G-9516-2012	Guerron-Orejuela, Edgar/0000-0002-2653-1825; 													0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		A				300	309		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.015													WOS:000407186000033

Based oil the reasons for and time period of backflow. this Study estimated the spatial-temporal extent and the change of water clarity influenced by sediments within the backflow and northern Poyang Lake using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The results revealed that the sediments front backflows together with dredging activities in the northern Poyang Lake not only affected the northern Poyang Lake, but also influenced the central and southern Poyang Lake and the Poyang Lake national nature reserve. and resulted in great decline of water clarity in the regions influenced, which could seriously affect the lake ecosystem. The results indicated that MODIS images have potential for monitoring the distribution of sediments from backflows and dredging activities. However, the potential is limited because of the frequent cloud cover in the Study area and the characteristics of backflow itself. The dredging activity combined with backflows might have great negative impacts on the Poyang Lake ecosystem. and it Would be worthwhile to explore the possible impacts in order to develop scientific knowledge to support the decisions. which need to be made by the responsible authorities for deciding how to rationally manage this Unique lake ecosystem Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.					邬国锋/B-8735-2018; Chen, Lili/HJY-7871-2023														0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 15	2009	23	2					342	350		10.1002/hyp.7163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7163													WOS:000262602000014

Spatial and seasonal variations in mercury methylation and microbial community structure in a historic mercury mining area, Yolo County, California	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY					Annual Fall American-Geophysical-Union Meeting	DEC 13-14, 2008	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union, Mineralog Soc Amer, Dept Energy				The relationships between soil parent lithology, nutrient concentrations, microbial biomass and community structure were evaluated in soils from a small watershed impacted by historic Hg mining. Upland and wetland Soils, stream sediments and tailings were collected and analyzed for nutrients (DOC, SO4=, NO3-), Hg, MeHg, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Stream sediment was derived from serpentinite, siltstone, volcanic rocks and mineralized serpentine with cinnabar, metacinnabar and other Hg phases. Soils from different parent materials had distinct PLFA biomass and community structures that are related to nutrient concentrations and toxicity effects of trace metals including Hg. The formation of MeHg appears to be most strongly linked to soil moisture, which in turn has a correlative relationship with PLFA biomass in wetland soils. The greatest concentrations of MeHg (>0.5 ng g(-1) MeHg) were measured in wetland soils and soil with a volcanic parent (9.5-37 mu g g(-1) Hg). Mercury methylation was associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria, including Desulfobacter sp. and Desulfovibrio sp., although these organisms are not exclusively responsible for Hg methylation. Statistical models of the data demonstrated that soil microbial communities varied more with soil type than with season.

In the American Midwest these amenities range from lakes to forests to pastoral landscapes, depending on the ecological province. We used simple linear regression models to test the hypotheses that physiographic, land cover (composition and spatial pattern), forest characteristics, land use on undeveloped land, public ownership, soil productivity and proximity to urban centers predict changes in population, housing, and seasonal housing densities over a 10-year interval (1980-1990). We then generated multiple-regression models to predict population, total and seasonal housing density change in the most recent decade (1990-2000) based on ownership and ecological conditions in 1990 and tested them by comparing the predictions to actual change measured by the US Census Bureau. Our results indicate that the independent variables explained between 25 and 40% of the variability in population density change, 42-67% of the variability of total housing density change, and 13-32% of the variability in seasonal housing density change in the 1980s, depending on the province. The strength of the relationships between independent and dependent variables varied by province, and in some cases the sign varied as well. Topographic relief was significantly related to population growth in all provinces, and land cover composition and the presence of water was significantly related to total housing growth in all provinces. There was a surprisingly limited association of any of the independent variables to seasonal housing growth in the northern province, which is commonly perceived to attract seasonal use because of ecological amenities. Proximity to urban centers is related to population and housing density change, but not seasonal housing density change. Our tests indicated that models for population density change showed some utility, but the models for total and seasonal housing density generally performed poorly. Ecologic variables were consistently poor at predicting seasonal housing density change. Our results show that environmental characteristics appear to have some influence on the spatial distribution of population and housing change in the Midwest, although other factors that were not modeled are clearly dominant.

J	Ventura, M; Catalan, J				Ventura, M; Catalan, J			Reproduction as one of the main causes of temporal variability in the elemental composition of zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												With the aim to determine the contribution of development and reproduction to the variability in the elemental composition of zooplankton, we measured the carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) elemental composition of the planktonic crustacean assemblage in an alpine lake for a whole seasonal cycle. The species included three distinct living modes: a cladoceran, Daphnia pulicaria; a cyclopoid copepod, Cyclops abyssorum; and a calanoid copepod, Diaptomus cyaneus. For the three species, reproduction was the main cause of elemental variability. Adult females of the three species lost from 32% to 48% of their initial absolute C and H content during reproduction, which corresponded to a similar decrease in their lipid and carbohydrate content. The N content did not change in any of the three species, nor did the protein and chitin content. Daphnia and Diaptomus lost 35% and 56%, respectively, of their initial absolute P content during reproduction, whereas the P content of Cyclops did not change. The three species stored energy compounds under unfavorable conditions for later use in offspring production, but only Diaptomus and Daphnia mobilized stored P. Corresponding stoichiometric changes with reproduction included a decrease in C: N ratio for the three species; an increase in N: P ratio for Daphnia adult females and adults of Diaptomus; and a C: P ratio increase in Diaptomus females and decline in Cyclops females. Differences in C: P ratio changes corresponded with differences in allocation to their respective reproductive tissues. Diaptomus males and Daphnia females did not change their C: P ratio with reproduction.					; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008	Ventura, Marc/0000-0003-1401-414X; Catalan, Jordi/0000-0002-2934-4013													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2005	50	6					2043	2056		10.4319/lo.2005.50.6.2043	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.6.2043													WOS:000233370600031

However, the responses of the DNR pathways in the floodplain lake to the record-breaking FD in 2022 in Yangtze River of China, as well as the underlying microbial mechanisms and feedbacks to climate change remain poorly understood. Here, we collected exposed sediments and Carex cinerascens-associated soils in the littoral wetlands of Poyang Lake during 2022 FD and the dry seasons prior to and after this event. The potential DNR rates and the synergistic metabolism of microbial guilds involved in DNR were investigated using 15N isotope pairing technique, high-throughput and metagenomic sequencing. We found that the in situ N2O fluxes in the littoral wetlands were highest during the flash drought, especially in the exposed sediments. The potential DNRA rates were highest under flash drought conditions, and DNRA dominated the DNR for both exposed sediments (80.4 %) and Carex cinerascens-associated soils (57.5 %). Nutrients (i.e., N and P) and DNRA bacterial communities played a key role in producing the extremely high N2O fluxes from exposed sediments, which could be explained by the synergistic metabolism of DNRA bacteria and denitrifiers through the exchange of the key intermediates in DNR. Therefore, the climate change-induced flash drought promoted greater nitrous oxide emissions and N retention in the littoral wetlands of Poyang Lake, producing a greater flux of greenhouse gas emissions and elevating the risk of lake eutrophication.

J	McLean, CA; Moussalli, A; Stuart-Fox, D				McLean, Claire A.; Moussalli, Adnan; Stuart-Fox, Devi			The predation cost of female resistance	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Mating costs to females can result in female reluctance to mate and the evolution of seemingly costly rejection strategies. The costs of mating have been widely studied; however, the costs of resistance have rarely been quantified. In the Lake Eyre dragon, Ctenophorus maculosus, gravid females flip over onto their backs to prevent superfluous matings. In doing so, they compromise their camouflage as females have bright orange ventral coloration during the breeding season. Visual models confirmed that resisting females are much more conspicuous to birds, their primary predator, than unresisting females. We assessed the predation risk of female resistance via a large-scale field experiment using model female lizards. Although the flipped over, orange models were more conspicuous to visual predators, they were attacked significantly less than cryptic models. It appears that predators avoid the bright females, possibly because they do not recognize orange individuals as food or avoid rare, conspicuously colored prey. Thus, conspicuous female rejection displays may be maintained in part by apostatic selection, in which predators form a search image for and preferentially attack more common prey types.

A multi-proxy palaeoecological record of late-Holocene forest expansion in lowland Bolivia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pollen, charcoal, and bulk sediment stable carbon isotope analysis of a 2.4 m sediment core from Laguna Yaguaru in eastern Bolivia, located near the modern ecotone between the humid, evergreen Amazon rainforest and the seasonally-dry, semi-deciduous Chiquitano dry forest, provides a >5600 year record of environmental change in an area sensitive to changes in the strength of the South American monsoon. The core consists of organic sediment interrupted by a 15 cm mineral facies deposited similar to 5270 yr BP in a low-energy flood event in the Yaguaru basin. Pollen data indicate that the basin contained a cattail (Typha) marsh prior to the flood. Some dry forest elements were present, probably growing within small patches of forest within a matrix of generally open vegetation including marsh, savanna, and savanna woodland. Above the flood-layer. Typha pollen is absent, indicating open-water conditions, and pollen assemblages are similar to modern pollen spectra from Bolivian dry forests. Around 1200 BP charcoal concentrations decrease, carbon isotope ratios become more negative, and Celtis pollen rises dramatically, signaling forest expansion and the development of the modern closed-canopy dry forest at Laguna Yaguaru. The wetter conditions implied by this forest expansion suggest the region was affected by the strengthening South American monsoon at this time. The timing of the arrival of monsoon moisture at Yaguaru is consistent with nearby records, allowing a similar to 700 year delay for the migration of the monsoon to reach the more southerly location of Yaguaru.

A comparison of flooded forest and floating meadow fish assemblages in an upper Amazon floodplain	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Matched sets of gillnets of different mesh-sizes were used to evaluate the degree to which contiguous and connected flooded forest and floating meadow habitats are characterized by distinct fish faunas during the flooding season in the Peruvian Amazon. For fishes between 38 - 740 mm standard length (L-S) (the size range captured by the gear), an overriding pattern of faunal similarity emerged between these two habitats. The mean species richness, diversity, abundance, fish mass, mean and maximum L-S, and maximum mass did not differ significantly between flooded forest and floating meadows. Species abundances followed a log-normal distribution in which three species accounted for 60 - 70% of the total abundance in each habitat. Despite these similarities, multivariate analyses demonstrated subtle differences in species composition between flooded forest and adjacent floating macrophytes. In addition, the absolute number of species was higher in flooded forest, reflecting a higher percentage of rare species. The day-night species turnover was found to be greater in flooded forests than floating meadows. Further, nocturnal samples had higher abundances and greater species richness than diurnal samples in both habitats. Differences in habitat structural complexity between flooded forest and floating meadows may result in a higher abundance and species richness of day-active species in floating meadows.

Carbon monoxide (CO) measurements in the upper troposphere ( UT) clearly show the influence of plumes from boreal forest fires burning around Lake Baikal between April and July. On many flights, CO concentrations were above 300 ppbv over several hundred kilometers, with values above 500 ppbv over 50 kilometers and peaks up to 800 ppbv. To our knowledge, such high UT CO concentrations have never been reported before. A case study reveals that biomass burning plumes were rapidly transported by a warm conveyor belt.

Twelve microsatellite markers were analyzed for 394 fish sampled at the end of the spawning season from seven sites located all around the lake (between 42 and 61 fish per site). The measure of genetic differentiation, F-ST, was low overall (0.0035), but significant for twelve pairwise site comparisons. In contrast, Bayesian cluster analyses indicated no support for the presence of more than one distinct genetic cluster. We conclude that there is only one population in the lake. Therefore, the Eurasian perch should be managed as a single stock. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Huang, WR; Chen, SS; Yang, XJ; Johnson, E				Huang, Wenrui; Chen, Shuisen; Yang, Xiaojun; Johnson, Elijah			Assessment of chlorophyll-a variations in high- and low-flow seasons in Apalachicola Bay by MODIS 250-m remote sensing	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is considered as a primary indicator for water quality and foods for oyster growth in Apalachicola estuarine ecosystem. Assessment of chl-a concentration variation in response to river inflow is important for estuarine environmental research and management. In this study, remote sensing analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effects of river inflow on chlorophyll concentrations in Apalachicola Bay of Florida in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. A remote sensing model for chl-a was improved and applied to map spatial distributions of chl-a by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m resolution imageries in high-flow and low-flow seasons in 2001 and 2008. Chl-a values approximately ranged from the minimum 6 mu g/l to the maximum 29 mu g/l in the study period. Maximum chl-a concentration in high-flow season was almost twice above that in low-flow season. The averaged mean and minimum chl-a level in the high-flow season were approximately 42 and 28 % higher than those in low-flow season, respectively. The remote sensing mapping of chl-a was able to show spatial variations of chl-a in the entire bay under different flow conditions, which indicated its advantage over the traditional field data sampling for monitoring water quality over a large area of estuary. The MODIS 250-m remote sensing regression model presented from this study can be used to support monitoring and assessment of the spatial chl-a distribution in the bay for environmental research and management in Apalachicola Bay.

In the present paper, radiometric calibration accuracy of FungYun-3A (FY-3A) Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) thermal infrared (TIR) channel was evaluated based on simultaneous nadir observation (SNO) intercalibration method. Hyperspectral and high-quality measurements of METOP-A/IASI were used as reference. Assessment uncertainty from intercalibration method was also investigated by examining the relation between BT bias against four main collocation factors, i. e. observation time difference, view geometric difference related to zenith angles and azimuth angles, and scene spatial homogeneity. It was indicated that the BT bias is evenly distributed across the collocation variables with no significant linear relationship in MERSI IR channel. Among the four collocation factors, the scene spatial homogeneity may be the most important factor with the uncertainty less than 2% of BT bias. Statistical analysis of monitoring biases during one and a half years indicates that the brightness temperature measured by MERSI is much warmer than that of IASI. The annual mean bias (MERSI-IASI) in 2012 is (3. 18 +/- 0. 34) K. Monthly averaged BT biases show a little seasonal variation character, and fluctuation range is less than 0. 8K. To further verify the reliability, our evaluation result was also compared with the synchronous experiment results at Dunhuang and Qinghai Lake sites, which showed excellent agreement. Preliminary analysis indicates that there are two reasons leading to the warm bias. One is the overestimation of blackbody emissivity, and the other is probably the incorrect spectral respond function which has shifted to window spectral. Considering the variation character of BT biases, SRF error seems to be the dominant factor.					; Hu, Xiuqing/E-6625-2011; Xu, Na/JFB-0653-2023; Zhang, Yong/AEO-7230-2022; Sun, Ling/AAD-1300-2019	Zhang, Yong/0000-0001-9760-684X; 													1000-0593					DEC	2014	34	12					3429	3434		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)12-3429-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)12-3429-06								25881453					WOS:000346224300053

For a long time, flooding has been experienced in the surrounding areas of the Rift Valley lakes including Lake Baringo fed by River Perkerra due to the rising water levels because of the above normal rainfall season resulting in massive socioeconomic losses. The study aims at predicting the occurrence of floods in River Perkerra using ANN model with the input data being 417 consistent pairs of daily rainfall and discharge, simulated runoff as the output. The model was trained, tested and validated producing a best fit regression with R-2 of 0.951 for training, 0.938 for validation, 0.953 for testing giving an average of 0.949 indicating a close relationship between the input and output values. The overall best validation performance, RMSE was 0.9204 m(3)/s indicating high efficiency of the FFNN model developed to predict floods. Flows greater than 14 m(3)/s, Q1, were the extreme flood events closely associated with the socioeconomic losses. This prediction of Q1 value is crucial in the formulation and implementation of measures and policies by the County Government that will mitigate adverse impacts of predicted floods in the catchment.

However, wild-caught breeders have persistently failed to spawn spontaneously in captivity. Cloning of the gonadotropin subunits and analysing seasonal variation in reproductive hormone levels for a 1 year period were done to gain knowledge on the physiological basis underlying the reproductive biology of np. The 13-follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH-13) and 13-luteinizing hormone (LH-13) subunits and their common a-glycoprotein (Gph-a) subunit were cloned using 3 ' and 5 ' RACE-PCR. The nucleotide sequences of the npgph-alpha, npfsh-beta, and nplh-beta subunits were 664, 580 and 675 nucleotides in length, encoding peptides of 124, 120 and 148 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of each mature subunit showed high similarity with its counterparts in other teleost. Sequence analysis showed that npFSH-13 is more similar to higher vertebrate FSH-13s than to higher vertebrate LH-13s. Heterologous immunoassay was calibrated to analyse pituitary LH levels. While the LH immunoassay showed parallelism of npLH with that of tilapia (ta), no parallelism for FSH was found. Levels of pituitary LH were higher in females at gonadal stages of vitellogenic oocytes, mature secondary oocytes and mature tertiary oocytes with migrating nucleus than in pre-vitellogenic oocytes and early and late perinucleolus oocytes. Using competitive steroid ELISA, variations in the levels of the steroid hormones 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in males and E2 in females were characterized in relation to month and reproductive index of Nile perch. Our findings show that in females, gonadosomatic index and plasma E2 were highly correlated (R2 = 0.699, n = 172) and peaked from September to November while in males, the gonadosomatic index and plasma 11-KT peaked from October to November. In female fish, both steroid hormones were detected in the plasma but greatly varied in concentrations. E2 in particular, increased with the developmental stage of the gonads. The levels of steroid hormones, E2 and 11-KT in females and males respectively increased with fish size (total lengths) and suggest that females mature at a body length of 40-59 cm than their counter part males that mature at a total length of 60-70 cm. Taken together, we describe seasonal endocrine differences in wild-caught adult Nile perch which could potentially be exploited to manipulate the reproductive axis in cultured breeders.

Survival and performance of the invasive vine Vincetoxicum rossicum(Apocynaceae) from seeds of different embryo number under two light environments	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The normative vine Vincetoxicum rossicum threatens several ecosystems in the Lower Great Lakes Basin of North America. One feature that may contribute to its invasiveness is the production of some seeds with multiple embryos (polyembryony), which may be beneficial as a bet-hedging strategy in variable environments. However, lower seed reserves per embryo in polyembryonic seeds may entail costs in low-light environments. The effect of seed from three embryonic classes (1, 2, or 3 embryos/seed) on V rossicum survival and growth was studied under two forest understory light environments: full canopy (shade) or canopy gaps (light) in New York state. Two seedling cohorts were planted, in May 2004 and in May 2005. The survival and growth of seedlings was monitored biweekly for two (2005 cohort) or three (2004 cohort) seasons. For both cohorts, plants grown in canopy shade had reduced survival and growth compared with those grown in gaps. Contrary to expectations, seed embryo number had no effect on the final height, survival, or dry mass of plants in either habitat. Our results suggest that any fitness advantage provided by polyembryony may be habitat (light) dependent and not a general trait that affords V rossicum a benefit in all habitats colonized.

But it is unclear for nano-Fe2O3 to affect the fate of coexisting arsenic (As) with its bioaccumulation and biotransformation. In this study, we thus mainly investigated arsenate (As(V)) toxicity, uptake kinetics, biotransformation and subcellular distribution in Microcystis aeruginosa influenced by nano-Fe2O3. The results showed that M. aeruginosa was more sensitive to As(V) associated with nano-Fe2O3. Due to the exaggerated increase of efflux rate constants of As compared with the uptake rate constants in algal cells affected by different levels of nano-Fe2O3, the As(V) bioconcentration factor decreased with nano-Fe2O3 increasing correspondingly, indicating that As bioaccumulation was diminished by nano-Fe2O3. The decreased As accumulation in M. aeruginosa could be supported by the evidential As(V) sequestration through high adsorption of nano-Fe2O3, which resulted in decreasing free As level for algae uptake in media. Meanwhile, As subcellular distribution was adjusted by nano-Fe2O3 with decreasing in cell walls and rising in cytoplasmic organelles compared with nano-Fe2O3 free. As(V) reduction and methylation were enhanced with increasing nano-Fe2O3, stimulating by its sensitivity to the interaction of nano-Fe2O3 and As(V) as well as the rising level of As in cytoplasmic organelles of this algae. It is confirmed by the higher relative gene expression levels of arsC and arsM in elevated nano-Fe2O3. Accordingly, it is highlighted to be deserved more attention that the changing behavior of As(V) by nano-Fe2O3 that reduce As bioaccumulation and accelerate its biotransformation in algae in As contaminated water.

However, these metrics are not functionally equivalent and provide different information regarding community structure. Differences in the response of zooplankton, as estimated through both density and biomass in relation to environmental variability, were investigated in a large subtropical lake. Results based on 2 years of seasonal sampling at 9 points in Lake Mangueira (southern Brazil) showed a large difference in the pattern of dominance of zooplankton between the density and biomass metrics. Ciliates composed >58% of zooplankton density (rotifers 29.4%) but only 16.1% of zooplankton biomass. Analyzing the composition of zooplankton based only on biomass might therefore underestimate the importance of microzooplankton components, which are an important trophic link in pelagic food webs of subtropical systems. The differences between the 2 metrics in relation to abiotic variables were assessed through redundancy analysis. Seasonality was the main factor driving the variability of zooplankton, and density proved to be the best metric to show the seasonal variation of zooplankton taxa and taxonomic groups in relation to environmental conditions. Density was also the most appropriate metric for analyzing annual cycles and the seasonal succession of species. However, the biomass metric was significantly related to production-related parameters (pH and chlorophyll a) and was essential to better understand zooplankton grazing relationships and the trophic structure of the system.

Whitefish constituted 97% of the numerical catches and whitefish with high number of gill rakers (DR) were the most abundant whitefish form. Forms with low numbers of gill rakers used only epibenthic habitats during both the day and night in all study periods: large whitefish with low numbers of gill rakers (LSR) dwelled mainly at depths 0-10 m, whereas small whitefish with low numbers of gill rakers (SSR) used deeper (>10m) habitats. LSR and SSR whitefish consumed mainly benthic macro-invertebrates during all study occasions. The planktivorous DR whitefish used both epibenthic and pelagic habitats, but vertical habitat selection varied both over time of day and season. In June, when light intensity was continuously high, DR whitefish did not perform diel vertical migrations. In August and September, when dark nights were distinguishable, DR whitefish ascended from the bottom to the pelagic at dusk to feed on zooplankton, and descended at dawn. DR whitefish used pelagic habitats only at the lowest light intensities during the night, which was probably related to the high predation risk from brown trout Salmo trutta.

J	Suriano, ZJ				Suriano, Zachary J.			Synoptic and meteorological conditions during extreme snow cover ablation events in the Great Lakes Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Snow cover ablation in the Great Lakes basin is a common and hydrologically important process during the cold season, contributing to a majority of the basin's runoff, and less frequent, extreme ablation events are highly impactful due to an increased flooding risk and warrant specific investigation. A brief climatology of extreme ablation events is presented, where extreme is considered within the top 5% of the distribution. Using synoptic classification techniques, individual weather patterns associated with extreme snow ablation in the Great Lakes basin are isolated. A single pattern deemed the most influential in generating extreme ablation events, southerly flow-1, is examined in detail, and three case studies are presented to determine the meteorological conditions and surface energy fluxes responsible for ablation. Over 75% of extreme events are associated with southerly flow patterns that predominantly ablate snow with sensible heat fluxes, while rain-on-snow patterns induce the remaining extreme events from 1980-2009. Type southerly flow-1 is responsible for 45% of the extreme events and is characterized by strong southerly advection of warm air into the basin, where sensible heat fluxes of 45-125 Wm(-2) are responsible for the majority of energy transfer into the snowpack. When compared with an average ablation event, an extreme ablation event for southerly flow-1 exhibits air temperatures, dew point temperatures, and wind speeds that are 3.8 degrees C, 3.0 degrees C, and 1.2 ms(-1) warmer and faster than an average event, indicating a greater potential for larger ablation.

J	Adkison, MD; Ward, MB; Quinn, TP				Adkison, Milo D.; Ward, Michael B.; Quinn, Thomas P.			Nest site preference and intrasexual competition in female sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Many ecological circumstances present individuals with a conflict between the inherent benefits of a particular habitat and the costs incurred in acquiring or retaining use of the habitat in the face of competition. For example, the reproductive biology of female Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) led us to hypothesize that female nest site choice should reflect a compromise between the benefits of obtaining a high quality nest site and the cost of competing for and defending it. To test this hypothesis we studied female sockeye salmon (O. nerka) spawning on beaches in Iliamna Lake, Alaska using a combination of snorkel surveys, tagging, behavior observations, and models. Females showed spatial preferences in nest site selection (for shallower water, where water circulation was higher), aggressive competition in preferred areas was higher, and there was evidence for costs associated with this increased competition. Over the course of the season, spawning activity shifted from shallower to deeper water, consistent with a tradeoff between benefits for embryo survival associated with shallow sites and the costs of competing for them. However, it was also consistent with date-specific optimal sites related to the probability of embryo mortality for eggs spawned in shallow water late in the season, due to annual cycles in lake level and temperature.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2014	97	4					385	399		10.1007/s10641-013-0159-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-013-0159-x													WOS:000332150200005
J	Yeo, HG; Choi, M; Chun, MY; Sunwoo, Y				Yeo, HG; Choi, M; Chun, MY; Sunwoo, Y			Gas/particle concentrations and partitioning of PCBs in the atmosphere of Korea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Air samples were taken in a rural area of Kyonggi-do of South Korea to investigate gas/particle concentration and partitioning. Gas/particle phase concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured over 48 h periods from September 2001 to July 2002. The average contribution (%) of gas to particle was about 90%, which suggests that in the atmosphere PCBs predominantly existed in the gas phase. The correlation coefficients (r) between total PCBs and temperature (degreesC) showed negative correlation for particle phase and positive correlation for gas phase. The contribution (%) of PCB congeners to total PCBs in gas phase increased with decreasing chlorine substitution. The particle contribution (%) of PCB congeners increased for the less volatile congeners, i.e., those with the higher chlorine number. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between log (C-particle/C-gas) and log K-OA was 0.86, which implies that heavier PCB congeners exist more in particle phase than gas phase compared to lighter PCBs. Partitioning of PCBs between gas and particle phases correlated well with the sub-cooled liquid vapor pressure (P-L(o)) and the octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA) for all samples, but the coefficient of determination (R-2) differed for each season.

Our objective was to evaluate water quality in the south Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida using several multivariate techniques and a comprehensive water quality index (WQI). Clustering was used to cluster the six monitoring stations into three groups, with stations on the same or characteristic- similar canals being in the same group. The first five factors from exploratory factor analysis (EFA) explain around 70% of the total variance and were used to interpret water quality characterized by original constituents for the purpose of data reduction. Nutrient species ( phosphorus and nitrogen) were major variables involved in the construction of the principal components (PCs) and factors. Seasonal and spatial differences were observed in compositional patterns of factors and principal water quality constituents. Positive or negative trends were detected for different factor at different monitoring groups identified by clustering during different seasons. The composite WQI was developed based on principal water quality constituents greatly contributing to the construction of factors which were derived from EFA. The WQI showed significant difference among the three clustering groups with the greatest WQI median in group 1 stations ( C23S48, C23S97, and C24S49). Medians of WQI were significantly greater in the wet than in the dry season, which implied more natural nutrient water status during the dry than the wet season probably due to the different contribution of nonpoint sources between two seasons.

J	Piperno, DR; Jones, JG				Piperno, DR; Jones, JG			Paleoecological and archaeological implications of a Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene record of vegetation and climate from the Pacific coastal plain of Panama	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A phytolith record from Monte Oscuro, a crater lake-located 10 m above sea level on the Pacific coastal plain of Panama, shows that during the Late Pleistocene the lake bed was dry and savanna-like vegetation expanded at the expense of tropical deciduous forest, the modem potential vegetation. A significant reduction of precipitation below current levels was almost certainly required to effect the changes observed. Core sediment characteristics indicate that permanent inundation of the Monte Oscuro basin with water occurred at about 10,500 C-14 yr B.P. Pollen and phytolith records show that deciduous tropical forest expanded into., the lake's watershed during the early Holocene. Significant burning of the vegetation and increases of; weedy plants at ca. 7500 to 7000 yr C-14 B.P. indicate disturbance, which most likely resulted from early human occupation of the seasonal tropical forest near Monte Oscuro, and the development of slash-and-burn methods of cultivation.

Agro-metrological drought index addressing seasonality and autocorrelation (AMDI-SA) was used in a Markov model in Umna lake basin, North West of Iran. Markov chain is adopted to model drought for joint occurrence of different classes of drought severity and sea surface temperature of Mediterranean Sea, which is called 2D Markov chain model. The proposed model, which benefits suitability of Markov chain models for modeling droughts, showed improvement results in prediction scores relative to classic Markov chain model not including SST-M information, additionally.					; Rezaie, Hossein/AGV-4453-2022; Bateni, Mohammad Mehdi/JFA-3465-2023	Bateni, Mohammad Mehdi/0000-0002-4444-3239; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				OCT	2018	32	13					4345	4358		10.1007/s11269-018-2056-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-2056-8													WOS:000442755700012

This study focuses on the Barato River in Hokkaido, Japan, employing an integrated approach of field measurements and Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing to monitor eutrophication as the river experiencing huge sewage effluents. Key parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chla), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) were analyzed. The developed empirical models showed a strong predictive capability for water quality, particularly for Chla (R2 = 0.87), DIP (R2 = 0.61), and SDD (R2 = 0.82). Seasonal analysis indicated peak Chla concentrations in October, reaching up to 92.4 mu g/L, alongside significant decreases in DIN and DIP, suggesting high phytoplankton activity. Advanced machine learning models, specifically back propagation neural networks, improved the prediction accuracy with R2 values up to 0.90 for Chla and 0.83 for DIN. Temporal analyses from 2018 to 2022 consistently revealed the Barato River's eutrophic state, with severe eutrophication occurring for 33% of the year and moderate for over 50%, emphasizing the ongoing nutrient imbalance. The strong correlation between DIP and Chla highlights phosphorus as the main driver of eutrophication. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of integrating remote sensing and machine learning for dynamic monitoring of river eutrophication, providing critical insights for nutrient management and water quality improvement.					; Pramanik, Malay/AAU-1085-2021; kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Meraj, Gowhar/G-5544-2015; Avtar, Ram/C-7394-2012; alsulamy, saleh/ACJ-0897-2022	Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7099-7297; Meraj, Gowhar/0000-0003-2913-9199; Avtar, Ram/0000-0003-3653-5771; alsulamy, saleh/0000-0001-6991-1855														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	1							89	10.3390/w17010089	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17010089													WOS:001393395000001

While source-sink landscape models are widely used for non-point source pollution evaluation, their application in karst regions is challenged by ecological fragility, shallow soil layers, and severe soil erosion, limiting their effectiveness in accurately identifying pollution risks and CSAs. This study focuses on the Caohai Lake basin in southwestern China; it integrates the landscape-weighted load index (LWLI) and the universal soil loss equation (USLE) to assess non-point source pollution risks in the basin with the aim of precisely delineating critical source areas (CSAs). Total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) served as key predictors of water quality, and their responses to the LWLI and USLE were analyzed in the karst environment. The results revealed the following: (1) source landscapes cover 65% of the basin area, with cropland (40%) being the primary contributor to nitrogen pollution; (2) the LWLI and USLE explain 50-67% of the TP and TN variations during the wet season, with a sharp increase in water quality risk when the LWLI exceeds 0.75; and (3) high-risk and very high-risk areas account for 36.3% and 15.3% of the basin, respectively, and are concentrated in the northwest and south, where intensive agriculture and severe soil erosion dominate. These findings provide a scientific basis for non-point source pollution control in the Caohai Lake basin.					; yeyu, zhang/HTO-9390-2023	Yang, Haiquan/0000-0003-4826-8199; 														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	1							132	10.3390/w17010132	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17010132													WOS:001393392700001

The Melampsora americana Population on Salix purpurea in the Great Lakes Region Is Highly Diverse with a Contributory Influence of Clonality	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												Shrub willows (Salix spp.) are emerging as a viable lignocellulosic, second-generation bioenergy crop with many growth characteristics favorable for marginal lands in New York State and surrounding areas. Willow rust, caused by members of the genus Melampsora, is the most limiting disease of shrub willow in this region and remains extremely understudied. In this study, genetic diversity, genetic structure, and pathogen clonality were examined in Melampsora americana over two growing seasons via genotyping-by-sequencing to identify single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. In conjunction with this project, a reference genome of rust isolate R15-033-03 was generated to aid in variant discovery. Sampling between years allowed regional and site-specific investigation into population dynamics, in the context of both wild and cultivated hosts within high-density plantings. This work revealed that this pathogen is largely panmictic over the sampled areas, with few sites showing moderate genetic differentiation. These data support the hypothesis of sexual recombination between growing seasons because no genotype persisted across the two years of sampling. Additionally, clonality was determined as a driver of pathogen populations within cultivated fields and single shrubs; however, there is also evidence of high genetic diversity of rust isolates in all settings. This work provides a framework for M. americana population structure in the Great Lakes region, providing crucial information that can aid in future resistance breeding efforts.					; Smart, Larry/JBJ-5879-2023	Crowell, Chase/0000-0002-5398-7449; Wilkerson, Dustin/0000-0003-3996-7430; McMullen, Patrick/0000-0001-6030-117X; Lipzen, Anna/0000-0003-2293-9329; 													0031-949X	1943-7684				APR	2022	112	4					907	916		10.1094/PHYTO-05-21-0201-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-05-21-0201-R								34579556					WOS:000783101900019

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria and identify the most important nutrients for such dynamics in a semiarid artificial lake, the Oros reservoir, in north-eastern Brazil. Seventyseven water samples were collected in 11 campaigns (six during the dry season and five during the rainy season) from seven points. The attributes under investigation were the Secchi transparency, turbidity, pH, apparent colour, electrical conductivity, total solids, total phosphorus, soluble orthophosphate content, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia content, nitrate content, and cyanobacteria dynamics, resulting in a total of 924 samples (number of campaigns x number of points x number of attributes). Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to investigate the significance and determinant attributes of the spatio-temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria. Of the 17 species of cyanobacteria identified, 10 accounted for 72.47% of the total accumulated variance. During the rainy season, four homogeneous groups of cyanobacteria formed, whereas during the dry season, only three groups formed. The greatest concentrations occurred during the dry season, notably for Aphanocapsa spp., Cylindrospermopsis sp., and Geitlerinema sp., which are potentially toxic and show a greater affinity to the physical attributes of water. Climate seasonality was decisive in the spatiotemporal dynamics of cyanobacteria, and high transparency values limited excessive proliferation of the dominant species.					; LIMA JR, FRANCISCO/JCO-4512-2023; Meireles, Ana Célia/AAM-2342-2021; ANDRADE, EUNICE/N-1464-2019; Andrade, Eunice/N-1464-2019; Lopes, Fernando/AAS-1586-2021	Bezerra Lopes, Fernando/0000-0001-8285-2925; Maia Meireles, Ana Celia/0000-0002-8860-2043; de Oliveira Lima, Francisco Josivan/0000-0002-6620-6381; cleiton da rocha, francisco/0000-0002-6208-7434; Andrade, Eunice/0000-0002-9750-0364; 													0100-316X	1983-2125				APR-JUN	2022	35	2					423	435		10.1590/1983-21252022v35n218rc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1983-21252022v35n218rc													WOS:000784452700005

We documented the seasonality in temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, and water color on the behavior of toxic metals in water and soil of Lake Nike. Slope and seasons statistically related significantly (p < 0.05) with DO and SOC. Only Ni was not statistically related significantly to pH, water color, and temperature of the water, while mercury and cadmium statistically related significantly to the soil pH. Temperature and pH were within the WHO safety limits which are 20-32 degrees C and 6.5-8.5, respectively, in both water and soil samples. Potentially toxic metals levels for lead (Pb) (0.47-2.10 mg/L), mercury (Hg) (0.57-2.01 mg/L), cadmium (Cd) (0.34-1.82 mg/L), and nickel (Ni) (0.56-2.09 mg/L) exceeded the 0.01, 0.001, 0.003, and 0.02 mg/L WHO safety limits, respectively, while Zinc (Zn) level which ranged from 0.24 to 2.51 mg/L was within the WHO limit (5 mg/L) and the standard organization of Nigeria (SON) limit (3.0 mg/L) in both seasons. From our study, Lake Nike could be relatively toxic, and unsafe for aquatic habitation and human consumption.

This study provides an updated water balance model for Aswan High Dam Reservoir, which was validated using combined heterogeneous sources of information, including in situ gauge data, bias-corrected reanalyzed data, and remote sensing information. To investigate the future challenges, the spatial distribution of the annual/seasonal Aswan High Dam Reservoir surface air temperature trends over the period from 1979 to 2018 was studied. An increase of around 0.48 degrees C per decade in average annual temperature was detected, a trend that is expected to continue until 2100. Moreover, a set of machine learning models were developed and utilized to bias-correct the reanalyzed inflow and outflow data available for Aswan High Dam Reservoir. Finally, a policy tree optimization model was developed to inform the decision-making process and operation of the reservoir system. Results from the historical test simulations show that including reliable inflow data, accurate estimation of evaporation losses, and including new regulations and added projects, such as the Toshka Project, greatly affect the simulation results and guide managers through how the reservoir system should be operated in the future.

A series of strategies were adopted by the government to curb the rebound schistosomiasis endemic status that has prevailed since the early 2000s. This study aimed to elucidate the trends of schistosomiasis transmission and to appraise the effectiveness of the integrated control strategy in lake and marshland areas. Methods: Surveillance data of schistosomiasis in the Hubei province between 2005 and 2018 were analyzed, including conventional health control measures, integrated strategies, and measures that focused on the infection source. According to the local annual plan for schistosomiasis control in endemic counties, previous measures were human and snail control and surveillance. Residents aged 6-65 years were screened by an immunological detection method called indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) after the transmission season each year. All residents who tested positive were then asked to provide a fecal sample for examination by the miracidium hatching technique (MHT) to detect the presence of schistosomes. Moreover, systematic snail surveys were conducted as a part of the combined environmental sampling method. The latter included integrated strategies and measures that focused on the infection source. Bovine stool samples were also collected and concurrently assessed using the MHT by the agriculture department, river-hardening slope protection was constructed by the water conservancy department, and forestation promotion was conducted by the forest department. The effectiveness of the integrated control strategy was assessed using two indicators of resident and livestock infection rates and three indicators of snail epidemics across all endemic areas. Results: From 2005 to 2018, a total of 28. 46 million and 2. 05 million residents were assessed by immunological (IHA) and etiological (MHT) detection techniques, respectively. Snail surveys and molluscicide application were performed in 2. 26 hectares and 0. 37 hectares, respectively. Moreover, 2. 60 million bovines were assessed by etiological detection techniques (MHT). The river-hardening slope protection project was implemented in 503 places, and 46 thousand hectares in endemic areas underwent environmental modification. Forestation was implemented at an area of 0. 15 million hectares. Between 2005 and 2018, the epidemic indicators, including resident and livestock infection rates and the infested areas and infection rate of snails, all presented downward trends. The resident infection rate decreased from 3. 78% in 2005 to 0% in 2016, which persisted through 2018. The livestock infection rate decreased from 5. 63% in 2005 to 0% in 2013, which also persisted through 2018. From 2005 to 2018, the snail-inhabited area was slightly reduced, but the area of infected snails decreased to 0 in 2012; this persisted through 2018. All counties met the goal for schistosomiasis infection control, transmission control, and disruption of schistosomiasis activity in 2008, 2013, and 2018 separately. That means the goal has been achieved in each stage. Conclusions: The decline of the schistosomiasis epidemic rate demonstrates that the Chinese government was successful in meeting its public health goal in Hubei province. In the next decade, precision interventions must be implemented in endemic counties with a relatively low epidemic status to achieve the goals of the Outline of the Healthy China 2030 Plan. A similar strategy can be applied in other countries to eliminate schistosomiasis globally.					; Zhu, Honghao/AAV-3470-2020; Zhou, Xiaorong/M-3600-2014	sun, ling cong/0000-0003-0199-4724; 													0001-706X	1873-6254				JUL	2022	231								106417	10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.106417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.106417		APR 2022						35318000					WOS:000806939900004

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although in situ sediment capping is frequently used to reduce internal loading of contaminants and nutrients, post-application assessment rarely includes the potential undesirable short-term effects on plankton species composition. We hypothesised that a modified zeolite (Z2G1) application as a sediment capping agent in Lake Okaro, New Zealand, could cause significant undesirable shifts in species composition of both zooplankton and phytoplankton due to burial of resting stages or interference with feeding for the zooplankton. Alternatively, we predicted that the capping agent might have no effect due to, for example, the coarse grain size of the material (1-3 mm). We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to identify any adverse effects of Z2G1 on zooplankton and phytoplankton species composition (i.e. shifts in community structure, including species loss) by comparing the community structure before and after the Z2G1 application. We found no significant differences in species composition before and after the Z2G1 application at the depths investigated (surface and 9 m). However, all of the analyses showed statistically significant differences among seasons, indicating seasonal variations in plankton composition far outweigh those that may have resulted from the Z2G1 application. Coarse particle size, low dose rate and a restricted area where the sediment capping agent was applied were considered to be the factors limiting potential adverse effects on plankton species. Considerations of finer-grained material to increase coverage and efficacy of phosphorus adsorption require assessment for their effects on zooplankton, however, and a direct mode of application into the hypolimnion is recommended to minimise effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton communities.

However, it remains unclear how floodplain wetlands respond to these hydrological changes. Here, from the perspective of both endogenous and exogenous memory of vegetation, we explored the response of Poyang Lake Wetland (PYLW) to multi-timescale hydrological dynamics. First, we applied a dynamic threshold method to extract land surface phenology from 2011 to 2020, subdividing the year into four sub-seasons. Next, based on wetland vegetation mapping, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) was used to simulate monthly net primary productivity (NPP). Then, with the NPP and inundation frequency time-series data, we assessed the time-lagged and cumulative response of PYLW vegetation to hydrological variability (exogenous memory) through Pearson rank correlation analysis. Subsequently, we employed partial correlation analysis, with the control of critical temporal hydrological variability, to evaluate the seasonal vegetation growth carryover (VGC) effect (endogenous memory). Finally, we proposed to use the seasonal VGC effect for modelling vegetation vulnerability under various extreme hydrological scenarios. The results reveal that the time-lagged and cumulative effects of hydrological variability on vegetation growth in PYLW reached the peak averagely after 6.51 and 7.08 months, respectively. The extreme hydrological scenarios in PYLW were categorized into three types of flood-only, flood-after-drought, and flood- before-drought. In the flood-after-drought scenario, vegetation generally showed high vulnerability, and the most vulnerable vegetation type varied across different scenarios. Our findings provide effective support for vegetation restoration, hydrological management, and biodiversity conservation in floodplains.

At present, little is known about the origin of these ecosystems and whether or not they are ancient or anthropogenically derived mosaics. This paper provides new insights into the environmental history and drivers of change in the Central Highlands of Madagascar during the last 6300 years through palaeoecological records from Lake Dangovavy. Our results suggested that open and mosaic ecosystems have been present in the landscape for at least 6000 years that is, 4 cal. ka BP before human settlement (2 cal. ka BP). Between 6.3 and 2 cal. ka BP landscapes were characterized by a mosaic ecosystem dominated by a matrix of open montane grassland and ericoid shrubland with extent forest patches, associated with seasonal variation of rainfall, and fire. A matrix of ericoid shrubland remained abundant in the landscape despite an increase of fire regime and herbivory activities between 2 and 1.1 cal. ka BP. Major changes in the vegetation were recorded during the last millennium with a shift towards a more open C4-dominated grassland associated with high fire frequency and herbivory activities, most likely linked to human influence. Our findings support the notion of the natural presence of open ecosystems on the islands. These shed light on the landscape history which should be considered when setting conservation goals with a particular focus on areas targeted for tree plantations and fire bans like the Central highlands of Madagascar.

Seasonal prey taxa and size selection and drivers of age-0 walleye ontogenetic diet shifts	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Prey abundance and size vary seasonally, creating a dynamic connection between predator and prey. The natural complexity related to consuming multiple prey types as fish undergo ontogenetic diet shifts combined with the frequent sampling and substantial laboratory time investment required to investigate seasonal predator-prey dynamics limits understanding of seasonal prey availability and age-0 prey taxa and size selection. Our study used frequent prey sampling spanning a four-year period to understand which prey taxa and sizes are seasonally available to age-0 walleye Sander vitreus, which were sampled from May to November across all four years of this study to document food habits and prey sizes. Consumed prey were then compared to available prey within the reservoir to evaluate prey taxa and size selection. Age-0 walleye seasonal food habits were consistently simplistic as age-0 walleye in this study largely consumed a single zooplankton taxa (calanoida) and then shifted directly to piscivory where they again focused consumption on a single taxa, and age group (age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum) while passing over available benthic macroinvertebrates. The ontogenetic shift to larval gizzard shad coincided with peak larval shad availability. Interestingly, age-0 walleye were size selective for both prey types, selecting the largest calanoida available when zooplanktivorous but consuming some of the smallest age-0 gizzard shad despite increasing gape size that would have allowed for consumption of larger shad.					; Small, Brian/I-3762-2012	Miller, Brett/0000-0001-7128-0538; Schoenebeck, Casey/0000-0002-4787-574X													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 31	2024	39	1							2426555	10.1080/02705060.2024.2426555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2024.2426555													WOS:001362799300001

Duiya Glacier, which terminates in a lake, exhibits approximately 10 m/yr higher horizontal speed and a higher melting rate with a vertical Non-Surface-Parallel-Flow (nSPF) velocity of - 7 m/yr than those of its land-terminating counterpart - West Duosangpu Glacier. Notably, Duiya Glacier experiences significant seasonal velocity fluctuations with accelerated flow between May and October. By integrating glacier geometry, changes in glacier boundaries and the extent of proglacial lakes, the distribution of supraglacial lakes, and climatic variables, we reveal that proglacial and supraglacial lakes play a crucial role in increasing the flow velocities of Duiya Glacier. Duiya Glacier flows faster because of increased subglacial water pressure resulting from water influx from these lakes. This phenomenon becomes conspicuously evident during May - October, when increased meltwater due to increased temperatures and precipitation further elevates the subglacial water pressure. Our method highlights the potential for understanding the impact of glacial lakes on glacier movements at a large scale, leveraging the capabilities of satellite SAR PO-SBAS technology for continuous, wide-scale, high temporal resolution, and 3D velocity monitoring.					; liu, guoxiang/I-8174-2013; Che, Tao/K-7136-2013; wu, renzhe/ADE-9623-2022; Bie, Qiang/Q-3669-2017; bao, jiawen/KEH-0923-2024; FENG, DONGDONG/JOJ-6843-2023; Shi, Yueling/KYR-3555-2024	WANG, Xiaowen/0000-0001-6532-9606; Che, Tao/0000-0001-6848-7271; Bao, Jiawen/0000-0002-0054-9701; Bie, Qiang/0000-0002-6894-7474; Shi, Yueling/0000-0003-0874-9852													1753-8947	1753-8955				DEC 31	2024	17	1							2365964	10.1080/17538947.2024.2365964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2024.2365964													WOS:001251602100001

Evaluating the response of Cladocera to recent environmental changes in lakes from the central Canadian Arctic treeline region	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Arctic and subarctic ecosystems have undergone considerable environmental changes in recent years as the result of climate warming. Fossil records of freshwater diatoms in lakes throughout the circumpolar Arctic, including the central Canadian Arctic treeline region, have revealed marked directional shifts in diatom assemblages in recent lake sediments. These algal changes have been linked to longer growing seasons, decreased duration of ice cover, and/or increased thermal stability. The effects of these recent environmental changes on higher trophic levels, such as the Cladocera, are Still unclear. Using cladoceran remains preserved in the sediments of 50 lakes, which were previously examined for changes in diatoms, we show that significant changes in cladoceran species composition have Occurred from pre-industrial times to the present. However, these changes are considerably muted compared to the more substantial changes observed in the diatom record. We found no consistent patterns of change in planktonic cladocerans (i.e. Daphnia, Bosmina) Within our Study lakes, and the response of the Cladocera to environmental changes does not appear to be strongly coupled to recent changes in diatom communities, thus further confirming that the previously observed diatom changes were related to bottom-up limnological controls. These results highlight the complex response of Arctic freshwater food webs to climate change, and the need for incorporating multitrophic studies into climate change investigations.

In addition, we explore inter-annual variation in NDVI in both these contrasting vegetation communities. All measurements were taken across long-term experimental treatments in wet sedge and tussock tundra communities at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, in northern Alaska. Over 15 years (for wet sedge tundra) and 14 years (for tussock tundra), N and P were applied in factorial experiments (N, P and N + P), air temperature was increased using greenhouses with and without N + P fertilizer, and light intensity was reduced by 50% using shade cloth. during the peak growing seasons of 2001, 2002, and 2003, NDVI measurements were made in both the wet sedge and tussock tundra experimental treatment plots, creating a 3-year time series of inter-annual variation in NDVI. We found that: (1) across all tussock experimental tundra treatments, NDVI is correlated with aboveground plant biomass (r(2) =0.59); (2) NDVI-biomass relationships for tussock and wet sedge tundra communities are community specific, and; (3) NDVI values for tussock tundra communities are typically, but not always, greater than for wet sedge tundra communities across all experimental treatments. We suggest that differences between the response of wet sedge and tussock tundra communities in the same experimental treatments result from the contrasting degree of heterogeneity in species and functional types that characterize each of these Arctic tundra vegetation communities.					boelman, natalie/K-9789-2015; Griffin, Kevin/B-2629-2013	Griffin, Kevin/0000-0003-4124-3757; Boelman, Natalie/0000-0003-3716-2372													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2005	143	4					588	597		10.1007/s00442-005-0012-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0012-9								15812655					WOS:000229781100011

The long-term pollution trends in ICM at the whole lake/river scale have not yet been investigated; therefore, the risks associated with ICM and the influences of environmental factors remain understudied. Herein, the occurrence and distribution of ICM in the surface water of Taihu Lake were comprehensively investigated. In addition, the accuracy and applicability of different machine learning models for predicting ICM pollution and associated health risk were compared using meteorological and water quality parameters as inputs. The results revealed that the Sigma 7ICM concentration ranged from 10.8 to 454.6 ng/L, exhibiting significant spatial and seasonal variations, which reflected the influence of hydrodynamics and climatic conditions. Among the nine models, the RF model achieved the most accurate prediction of ICM, with R2 >= 0.92. Via feature importance ranking and linear relationship analysis, TN, NH3-N, S 275-295 , PS, SUVA254, UV254, and pH were identified as important factors affecting ICM. This study provides a hybrid framework that includes environmental pollution prediction, health risk analysis, and key environmental factor identification for ICM, providing scientific techniques for the application of machine learning in the analysis of trace organic contaminants.					; Yan, Sirui/NFS-9194-2025; Li, Zhigang/M-6625-2019; Wang, Yawei/C-5628-2015	Li, Zhigang/0009-0009-4051-6312; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR 15	2025	272								122999	10.1016/j.watres.2024.122999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.122999		DEC 2024						39729911					WOS:001403064500001
J	Menon, NN; Balchand, AN; Menon, NR				Menon, NN; Balchand, AN; Menon, NR			Hydrobiology of the Cochin backwater system - a review	HYDROBIOLOGIA												On the south west coast of India, there is an extensive estuarine system of backwaters, of which Vembanad Lake is the largest. The backwaters of Kerala support as much biological productivity and diversity as tropical rain forests. They are responsible for the rich fisheries potential of Kerala. Cochin backwaters situated at the tip of the northern Vembanad lake is a tropical positive estuarine system extending between 9 degrees 40' and 10 degrees 12'N and 76 degrees 10' and 76 degrees 30' E with its northern boundary at Azheekode and southern boundary at Thannirmukham bund. The lake has a length of 80 km and the width varies between 500 and 4000 m. A channel, about 450 m wide at Cochin gut and another at Azheekode, make permanent connections with the Arabian Sea. The depth of the estuary varies considerably. While the shipping channels are maintained at a depth of 10-13 m, the major portion of the estuary has a depth range of 2-7 m. Water from two major rivers viz., Periyar and Muvattupuzha drain into this estuary. During south west monsoon, the estuary is virtually converted into a freshwater basin even in areas around barmouth where salt water penetration occurs below 5 m depth only. The major hydrological variable in the Cochin backwaters is salinity, similar to the situations encountered in estuaries with a gradual declension of salinity from 30 at the entrance of the estuary to 0.2 at the point of entry of the rivers. Salinity gradient in the Cochin backwaters supports diverse species of flora and fauna depending on their capacity to tolerate oligohaline, mesohaline or marine conditions. Low lying swamps and tidal creeks, dominated by sparse patches of mangroves with their nutrient rich physical environment, support larvae and juveniles of many economically important species. Backwaters also act as nursery grounds of commercially important prawns and fishes. The fields around the backwater are suitable for aquaculture. These areas support traditional, seasonal and perennial prawn fishery. The changes in the hydrology controlled by the seasons play an important role in regulating the migrant fauna of the estuary. The Cochin backwater supports a well established endemic fauna. The nutrients and pollutants introduced into the estuary control to a great extent the distribution and abundance of less tolerant species in ecologically sensitive areas in the backwaters. Cochin backwaters, widely regarded as one of the polluted estuaries in India, receive contaminated freshwater inputs and discharges of effluents and partially treated sewage from many points throughout its tidally mixed zone. Recently, changes brought about in the estuary like reclamation and consequent shrinkage of the backwaters and the discharge of pollutants have made an adverse impact on the potential of aquatic ecosystems that used to support high levels of bioproductivity and biodiversity. The construction of Thannirmukham bund and Thottapally spillway to prevent salt water penetration into the paddy fields during pre-monsoon has led to serious ecological problems by interrupting the natural ebb and flow of tides. The hydrography, floral and faunal composition - its spatial and temporal variation plus assessments of the impact of the anthropogenic activities are presented in this review. An attempt to critically evaluate the status of the estuary from the biological and pollutional stand point is also done.																			0018-8158					JUL	2000	430	1-3					149	183		10.1023/A:1004033400255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004033400255													WOS:000088588900009

Epilithic algae and water samples were taken from four stations (one in the channel, others in the lake), between June 2012-May 2013 seasonally. Totally 51 taxa were observed belonging to the groups Bacillariophyta (37), Chlorophyta (8), Charophyta (4) and Cyanobacteria (2), respectively. The stations were clustered into main two groups based on UPGMA. The highest similarity value was determined between third and fourth station (94%). Saprobic Index (SI) was applied in order to determine biological water quality. Physicochemical parameters have been evaluated according to the Klee's method and Regulation on the Management of Surface Water Quality in Turkish (RMSWQ). According to the Klee's method, water quality was found unpolluted in Kovada Lake, and its channel while it was found as polluted based on RMSWQ. Biological water quality values indicated Lake Kovada as poorly polluted, but its channel as polluted. According to CCA, 84.6% of the variance was described by the first four axes of the relations of species and environmental variables (r=0.963), and pH, conductivity and Cl- were found to be the most influential variables on distribution of dominant taxa.																			1303-2712					JUL	2017	17	4					701	711		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_4_06	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/1303-2712-v17_4_06													WOS:000403575500006

Development and evaluation of a habitat suitability model for young lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the North Channel of the St. Clair River, Michigan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We evaluated the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of riverine nursery habitat for larval, young-of-year (YOY), and juvenile (<500 mm) lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the North Channel of the St. Clair River (SCR), Michigan, using habitat suitability modeling (HSM) and fish collections. This HSM was developed using georeferenced habitat information on substrates, invertebrate densities, benthic flow velocities, and water depth. High-quality habitat comprised 29.1% of the study area, primarily in river bends and other areas where water velocities were highly varied. In all, 283 larval lake sturgeon were collected, with the majority found in high-quality habitat (81%) and heavily clustered in three locations (91.2% of total catch). Substrate composition and benthic flow velocity were the best indicators of observed larval catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) patterns. Available data on captured YOY and juveniles were used to corroborate modeled habitat output and revealed strong associations between modeled habitat conditions and young lake sturgeon presence. An abundance of suitable habitat for young lake sturgeon within the North Channel of the SCR suggests that lack of suitable spawning habitat or high mortality early in life limits recruitment success in this system.

Sequences of almost continuous individual satellite images were transformed into a time series of parameters representing the spatial distribution of SST. Also used were in situ measured bulk SST, wind speed, solar radiation, and water temperature profiles with depth. Analysis of this data set shows strong diurnal and seasonal variations of the surface and vertical temperature field and the meteorological forcing. The temperature field is heterogeneous after noon, when radiation is high and wind speed is low and thermal layering develops. The temperature field is homogeneous during the nighttime, when solar radiation is absent and the high wind speed vertically mixes the upper layer.

We first developed and tested a 123-base pair S. formosus-specific genetic marker using a new pair of primers. Then we applied our eDNA method at five sampling sites throughout Muda Lake and at five different months. The study observed a marked seasonal variation in detection rates, with significantly higher rates during the wet months of August, January, and December compared to the dry season spanning May and June. The Asian arowana is known to breed during the rainy season and we therefore hypothesize its reproductive biology influences the concentration of eDNA in the lake. Our results also highlight the possible impact of abiotic factors in tropical freshwater ecosystems (such as high water temperature) on eDNA persistence. In conclusion, future applications of qPCR-based eDNA methods in tropical environments would benefit from locally evaluating the effects of both biotic and abiotic factors on species detection.

Feeding habits and predator-prey size relationships of mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi (Basilewsky) in a shallow lake, central China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The diet and predator-prey size relationships of mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi (Basilewsky) in Lake Xiaosihai along the middle reach of the Yangtze River were studied through stomach content analysis. A total of 401 specimens (91539 mm total length) were collected in 2007. The diet was dominated by topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus, redfin culter Cultrichthys erythropterus, and crucian carp Carassius auratus, with significant seasonal and ontogenetic differences. Ontogenetic variation in diet was apparent that larger prey items such as crucian carp and redfin culter became more common, while smaller prey such as topmouth gudgeon, bitterlings and shrimps gradually declined in the larger fish. Mandarin fish total length (TL) was strongly related to mouth gape width (GW) and gape height (GH). Mandarin fish TL and prey fish TL as well as mandarin fish GW and prey fish body depth (BD) were positively and linearly related for sharpbelly, redfin culter and crucian carp. Strong size selectivity for topmouth gudgeon, sharpbelly and redfin culter as prey indicated that the piscivorous mandarin fish can have potential impact on the population size structure of the three prey fish.

J	Holberton, RL; Wingfield, JC				Holberton, RL; Wingfield, JC			Modulating the corticosterone stress response: A mechanism for balancing individual risk and reproductive success in arctic-breeding sparrows?	AUK												Modulation of the adrenocortical stress response with respect to the degree of parental activity was investigated in three Arctic-breeding species of songbirds faced with limited opportunities to breed. The hypothesis that the strength of the response can be lowered when reproductive effort or investment is greatest was tested by measuring the adrenocortical response to handling stress during two breeding stages that represented different levels of reproductive effort (i.e. before young were present [preparental] and while feeding nestlings [parental]). Comparisons of the corticosterone stress response (baseline at capture and subsequent samples 5, 10, 30, and 60 min after capture) were made within and between both sexes of American Tree Sparrows (Spizella arborea), White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) breeding above the Arctic Circle at Toolik Lake, Alaska. In general, body mass and baseline corticosterone did not differ between sexes within each of the three species, nor did they change during the two stages of breeding (tree and White-crowned sparrows only). In all three species, males had stronger adrenocortical responses than females during the preparental period, a time when males may expend less in reproductive effort than females. However, during the parental stage (tree and White-crowned sparrows only), the stress response of males declined and became similar to that of females because both sexes fed young. Females of both species (having considerable reproductive effort throughout both stages via egg laying or incubation and feeding young) showed no change in stress response with breeding stage. These results support the hypothesis that individuals with limited opportunities to breed can modulate the adrenocortical stress response when reproductive effort or investment is greatest as a way to maximize breeding success.

In 2002, the highest phytocoenotic diversity was recorded; charophytes and vascular submerged macrophytes formed their own extensive communities. After stocking with grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.) in 2002, reduction of water transparency, as well as changes in qualitative and quantitative composition of macrophyte communities were observed. Submerged vegetation declined during subsequent growing seasons. Charophyte meadows vanished first. The introduction of grass carp appeared to be a potential trigger for the rapid changes observed in the vegetation.

At the same time, the biological and physicochemical factors (water temperature, irradiance, nutrients and phytoplankton species) affecting the primary production of phytoplankton were also measured in order to estimate the relationship between the distribution of the active phytoplankton and environmental factors. The potential maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II was used as an index of the degree of potential photosynthetic competence of phytoplankton. As a result, the simultaneous measurement of (F-v/F-m) and algal biomass showed clearly the seasonal and spatial distribution patterns of the photosynthetically active phytoplankton community, and the distributions were strongly dependent on the seasonal variation in the thermally stratified structure. In addition, the value of (FvFm) in the euphotic zone was found to be influenced mainly by the irradiance and to be affected indirectly by nutrient concentration and the species composition of the phytoplankton community. Greater understanding of the detailed distribution of photosynthetically active phytoplankton coupled with their biomass will encourage new developments in studies of aquatic ecosystems.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				OCT	2008	30	10					1169	1177		10.1093/plankt/fbn073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbn073													WOS:000260140300008

The Cinaruco is characterized by a highly predictable annual flood pulse, high transparency, and extremely low conductivity and suspended sediment load. During 2002 and 2003, 10 sites in the main channel and floodplain lagoons were sampled on 12 occasions. Correspondence analysis based on water physicochemical variables and algal biomass showed that similar to 80% of the variation in the multivariate space among sites and sampling dates was explained by 2 axes. During the high-water periods, river and lagoon sites showed high similarity in water variables and algal biomass. Conductivity, SiO3, and chlorophyll a concentrations (both benthic and sestonic) were low during the high-water phase. On the other hand, water variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass (sestonic and benthic) in river sites were the most important features of the spatial variability between main channel and lagoon sites during low-water phases. Benthic chlorophyll a was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials and affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, also appears to be responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops.					; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008; Montoya, Jose/A-6775-2008	Montoya, Jose V./0000-0002-9759-4946; Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793													0887-3593					MAR	2006	25	1					157	170		10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[157:HSABAB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[157:HSABAB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236565400013
J	Hood, EW; Williams, MW; Caine, N				Hood, EW; Williams, MW; Caine, N			Landscape controls on organic and inorganic nitrogen leaching across an alpine/subalpine ecotone, Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range	ECOSYSTEMS												Here we report measurements of organic and inorganic nitrogen (N) fluxes from the high-elevation Green Lakes Valley catchment in the Colorado Front Range for two snowmelt seasons (1998 and 1999). Surface water and soil samples were collected along an elevational gradient extending from the lightly vegetated alpine to the forested subalpine to assess how changes in land cover and basin area affect yields and concentrations of ammonium-N (NH4-N), nitrate-N (NO3-N), dissolved organic N (DON), and particulate organic N (PON). Streamwater yields of NO3-N decreased downstream from 4.3 kg ha(-1) in the alpine to 0.75 kg ha(-1) at treeline, while yields of DON were much less variable (0.40-0.34 kg ha(-1)). Yields of NH4-N and PON were low and showed little variation with basin area. NO3-N accounted for 40%-90% of total N along the sample transect and was the dominant form of N at all but the lowest elevation site. Concentrations of DON ranged from approximately 10% of total N in the alpine to 45% in the subalpine. For all sites, volume-weighted mean concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) were significantly related to the DIN:DON ratio (R-2 = 0.81, P < 0.001) Concentrations of NO3-N were significantly higher at forested sites that received streamflow from the lightly vegetated alpine reaches of the catchment than in a control catchment that was entirely subalpine forest, suggesting that the alpine may subsidize downstream forested systems with inorganic N. KCl-extractable inorganic N and microbial biomass N showed no relationship to changes in soil properties and vegetative cover moving downstream in catchment. in contrast, soil carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratios increased with increasing vegetative cover in catchment and were significantly higher in the subalpine compared to the alpine (P < 0.0001) Soil C:N ratios along the sample transect explained 78% of the variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and 70% of the variation in DON concentrations. These findings suggest that DON is an important vector for N loss in high-elevation ecosystems and that streamwater losses of DON are at least partially dependent on catchment soil organic matter stoichiometry.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				JAN	2003	6	1					31	45		10.1007/s10021-002-0175-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-002-0175-8													WOS:000181088800004

Nevertheless, GLs are situated in mountainous and valley regions, which are distinguished by their complex terrain and unpredictable weather conditions. This leads to restricted availability of optical imagery as a consequence of the frequent cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), however, encounters issues with geometric distortion. This paper introduces an unsupervised method based on geometric distortion detection (without orbit state information) and historical positioning using dual-orbit SAR imagery to research GL extraction effectively. This method detects low-quality pixels from dual-orbit SAR imagery through geometric distortion. It extracts GLs using a majority voting integration of unsupervised classification algorithms constrained by historical GL center points. The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) was chosen as a representative region for the study, and experiments were conducted from July to August 2018 using dual-orbit Sentinel-1 imagery. A total of 600 refined samples were used for comparative verification. The results demonstrate that this method is capable of reliably identifying the active and passive geometric distortions in SAR imagery. The fusion of dual-orbit SAR based on geometric distortion can effectively enhance the classification performance of remote sensing imagery and achieve the acquisition of GL water storage area during the flood season. The geometric distortion rate was reduced from 29.9% to 7.9% after fusion correction, and the accuracy, recall rate, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-Score were 0.989, 0.900, 0.908, 0.825, and 0.904, respectively. This serves as a reference for research that investigates the mechanisms of glacier-GL-climate change.

Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen, pH, water velocity, width and depth were important environmental factors that influenced cyanobacteria abundance. Trace metals, phosphate and nitrate increased significantly from values of previous studies indicating increased eutrophication of the river but were weakly correlated with cyanobacteria abundance and could be scarcely regarded as regulating factors. A higher cyanobacteria abundance was recorded during the wet season in most of the sampled stations. The dominant cyanobacteria included Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Oscillatoria limnetica and Anabaena spiroides. The toxins produced by these species could degrade water quality. The factors favouring cyanobacteria abundance were identified as increased pH. width and depth. Increase in cyanobacteria abundance was associated with reduction in dissolved oxygen and increase in BOD values. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (1-2): 33-43, Epub 2009 June 30.

Lakes appropriately assist in local weather regulation in a growing urban area. But as urban areas expand, these urban lakes continue to shrink, and the impact of the urban heat island (UHI) on these lakes continues to grow. This paper highlights the impact of land use change on the urban lakes of three different climates in West Bengal, India, and their role in mitigating the seasonal UHI situation. From 2000 to 2020, the urban area and LST in the vicinity of Rabindra Sarobar in Kolkata, Saheb bandh in Purulia and Mirik Lake in Darjeeling have been steadily increasing. On the other hand, the water and vegetation index have been declining in some cases. Also, validating the LST obtained from the satellite with the surface temperature shows that the relationship between these two elements is quite good. Of these three urban lakes, Mirik Lake is the best in overall condition, but Rabindra Sarobar is more conserved than the other two lakes. Not only that, the effect of LST on the types of land use is most noticeable in settlements and the LST increases with distance from wetlands towards the surrounding urban area. Even if the weather changes, it is expected that people will save these urban lakes in the future for their own needs.					; MOHINUDDIN, SK/ITT-0751-2023	Mohinuddin, Sekh/0000-0001-8330-2239; 													2363-6203	2363-6211				NOV	2022	8	4					4603	4627		10.1007/s40808-022-01367-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-022-01367-w		MAR 2022											WOS:000775684800001
J	Akbar, TA; Hassan, QK; Achari, G				Akbar, Tahir Ali; Hassan, Quazi K.; Achari, Gopal			A Methodology for Clustering Lakes in Alberta on the basis of Water Quality Parameters	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												In this study, a methodology for clustering 18 lakes in Alberta, Canada using the data of 19 water quality parameters for a period of 11 years (1988-2002) is presented. The methods consist of (i) principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the dominant water quality parameters, (ii) cluster analysis techniques to develop the characteristics of the clusters, and (iii) pattern-match lakes to determine the appropriate cluster for each of the lakes. The PCA revealed that three principal components (PCs) were able to explain similar to 88% of the variability and the dominant water quality parameters were total dissolved solids, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. We obtained five clusters for the period 1994-1997 by using the dominant parameters with water quality deteriorating as the cluster number increased from 1 to 5. Upon matching cluster patterns with the entire dataset, it was observed that some of the lakes belonged to the same cluster all the time (e. g., cluster 1 for lakes Elkwater, Gregg, and Jarvis; cluster 3 for Sturgeon; cluster 4 for Moonshine; and cluster 5 for Saskatoon), while others changed with time. This methodology could be applied in other regions of the world to identify the most suitable source waters and prioritize their management. It could be helpful to analyze the natural controlling processes, pollution types, impact of seasonal changes and overall quality of source waters. This methodology could be used for monitoring water bodies in a cost effective and efficient way by sampling only less number of dominant parameters instead of using a large set of parameters.					; Akbar, Tahir/D-3608-2012	Hassan, Quazi K./0000-0002-7034-359X; 													1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2011	39	10					916	924		10.1002/clen.201100050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201100050													WOS:000297016900005

Predicting Fish Growth Potential and Identifying Water Quality Constraints: A Spatially-Explicit Bioenergetics Approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic impairment of water bodies represents a global environmental concern, yet few attempts have successfully linked fish performance to thermal habitat suitability and fewer have distinguished co-varying water quality constraints. We interfaced fish bioenergetics, field measurements, and Thermal Remote Imaging to generate a spatially-explicit, high-resolution surface of fish growth potential, and next employed a structured hypothesis to detect relationships among measures of fish performance and co-varying water quality constraints. Our thermal surface of fish performance captured the amount and spatial-temporal arrangement of thermally-suitable habitat for three focal species in an extremely heterogeneous reservoir, but interpretation of this pattern was initially confounded by seasonal covariation of water residence time and water quality. Subsequent path analysis revealed that in terms of seasonal patterns in growth potential, catfish and walleye responded to temperature, positively and negatively, respectively; crappie and walleye responded to eutrophy (negatively). At the high eutrophy levels observed in this system, some desired fishes appear to suffer from excessive cultural eutrophication within the context of elevated temperatures whereas others appear to be largely unaffected or even enhanced. Our overall findings do not lead to the conclusion that this system is degraded by pollution; however, they do highlight the need to use a sensitive focal species in the process of determining allowable nutrient loading and as integrators of habitat suitability across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We provide an integrated approach useful for quantifying fish growth potential and identifying water quality constraints on fish performance at spatial scales appropriate for whole-system management.

Zebra mussel maturation and seasonal gametogenesis in Marion Reservoir, Kansas, USA	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												Based on its native distribution and temperature constraints, the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) was not expected to colonize southern portions of the U.S., but it has now spread from the Laurentian Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Temperature is critical in zebra mussel reproduction, yet no studies have compared gametogenesis in the cooler north vs. the warmer south. We studied zebra mussel seasonal gametogenesis in Marion Reservoir, Kansas, histologically, examining monthly gonad development and categorizing mussels into one of five stages: resting, early development, late development, mature, or reabsorbing. We also histologically examined multiple size classes to determine size at maturity, and measured juveniles on artificial substrates in the reservoir to determine time to maturity. Adults were mature March-August (at 7.8-34.6 degrees C), compared to mid-June-September (at 18-24 degrees C) in the Great Lakes. Sixty percent of zebra mussels were mature at 5 mm; 100% were mature at 7 mm, compared to 7.5-10 mm in the northern U.S. and 5-12 mm in Europe. Zebra mussels reached maturity within 4 weeks compared to 5 weeks in the Great Lakes and Europe. We conclude that zebra mussels in Kansas matured faster, at a smaller size, and that there could be multiple generations within one year, possibly contributing to greater spread across the region.																			2242-1300					NOV	2014	3	4					247	260		10.3391/bir.2014.3.4.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2014.3.4.06													WOS:000372415700006
J	Donders, TH				Donders, Timme H.			Middle Holocene humidity increase in Florida: climate or sea-level?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Florida climate in highly sensitive to both high and low latitude climate perturbations due to its latitudinal position surrounded by water masses that transport heat northward. A well-studied aspect is that middle Holocene conditions became significantly wetter in Florida, initiating widespread peat accumulation in the Everglades. This environmental change has been attributed to various climate forcings, such as migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), increases in tropical storm intensity, position of the Bermuda High, intensification of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and post glacial sea level rise (SLR). Discerning between these forcings is only possible with quantitative reconstructions from a transect of sites that are affected differentially. Application of a transfer function on a north-to-south gradient of pollen records from Florida lakes here shows that the pattern of increasing precipitation during the middle Holocene cannot be explained by SLR, but that ENSO intensification is an important contributing factor. Seasonal-resolved proxy records with improved age models are urgently needed to further solve these issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Invasive alien species water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes as abode for macroinvertebrates in hypertrophic Ramsar Site, Lake Xochimilco, Mexico	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												This paper presents information on the density, diversity and functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with water hyacinth in Antiguo Canal Cuemanco, part of Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City. Rare (low frequency and density) and dominant (high frequency and density) taxa prevailed in the assemblages, with the most predominant being Hyalella azteca, Chironomus plumosus and Ischnura denticollis. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling confirmed two climatic seasons: warm-rainy and cold-dry; the former with the highest diversity and density of taxa. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that conductivity, nitrates and turbidity explained the density variations of taxa. Antiguo Canal Cuemanco waters are spatially homogeneous with the characteristics of hypertrophic shallow lakes, inhabited by scrapers and gathering-collectors. The species found were tolerant to organic pollution.

The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in this water body has raised concerns regarding the presence of toxic metabolites. In order to understand the factors that promote the proliferation and distribution of cyanobacteria in the reservoir, physicochemical parameters, species composition, and toxicity of the reservoir water column were analyzed at monthly intervals over a 3-year period (2004-2007) using a range of analytical techniques. The results showed that cyanobacteria were absent in the dry period, returning after the onset of stratification. A succession pattern was observed within this group. The Aphanocapsa genus was dominant in the last rainy period of the study (October 2006 to March 2007). However toxicity was only detected when the genera Microcystis and Sphaerocavum were present (October 2005). The principal components analysis showed negative correlation between cyanobacteria and orthophosphate. The change of dominant cyanobacteria along the 3 years of study and the final prevalence of nontoxic genera in the reservoir is an evidence of water quality improvement in response to the management techniques implemented in the reservoir basin.

While the inverse relationship between salinity and zooplankton species richness is well-known across salinity gradients, few studies have documented closely the response of zooplankton to seasonal changes in salinity. Weekly sampling during two flood seasons at Sua Pan, an intermittent saline lake in central Botswana demonstrated the importance of spatial and temporal salinity gradients for crustacean community composition, associated with a decline in species richness, from 11 to three species. Conductivity ranged between 320 and 125,800 mu S cm(-1) during seasonal flooding; changing from dominance by HCO3- and CO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+, at the beginning of the floods, to NaCl dominated waters as the lake dried out and salinities increased. pH estimates generally ranged between 8.6 and 10, with maximum values recorded during initial flooding. Crustaceans comprised mainly Branchinella spinosa, Moina belli, Lovenula africana and Limnocythere tudoranceai, all of which occurred across a wide range of salinities, while halotolerant freshwater species (Metadiaptomus transvaalensis, Leptestheria striatochonca and the ostracods Plesiocypridopsis aldabrae, Cypridopsis newtoni and a newly identified Potamocypris species) disappeared above conductivities of 1,500 mu S cm(-1). A unique crustacean composition in southern Africa was attributed to Sua Pans' rare chemical composition among southern African saline lakes; flood waters on Sua Pan contained a higher proportion of Na+ and HCO3-, and less K+, Mg2+ and SO42+ than over 80% of records from salt pans elsewhere in southern African. The freshwater species of crustaceans in Sua Pan were similar to those found in other southern Africa lakes, and these similarities decreased in lakes with higher pH and proportions of Na, and less SO4 and Mg in their chemical composition. The predominant saline tolerant species on Sua Pan, however, showed a greater similarity to those in saline lakes in southern and East Africa with higher proportions of HCO3- and, particularly, Mg2+ in their chemical composition.

Morphofunctional changes of phytoplankton community during pluvial anomaly in a tropical reservoir	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The present study focuses on the structure and function of phytoplankton community during periods of marked changes in hydrological traits, influenced by an atypical climatic event (La Nina) and its impact on Armando Ribeiro Goncalves Reservoir of Rio Grande do Norte, situated in the Caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. The main questions addressed were: What are the effects of environmental factors on the temporal variation of Morphologically Based Functional Group (MBFG) of phytoplankton community? How does the composition of cyanobacterial species shift in relation to high and low trends of phytoplankton diversity? The samples were collected monthly during 2008-2009 and analyzed for pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen content and the nutrients, such as, nitrate-nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, total nitrogen and orthophosphate. Phytoplankton samples were collected for both qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate species richness index and species diversity index. The data was divided into two distinct hydrodynamic periods of instability and stability. The results demonstrate considerable changes in dissolved oxygen content, water transparency and nitrogen nutrients, which directly influenced the MBFG of phytoplankton community in space and time. The instability of reservoir water was caused by heavy rainfall, which exerts atypical external disturbances. The seasonal variation of MBFG demonstrates a change in cyanobacterial composition and their diversity during instability and stability periods. MBFG VII, composed by colonial cyanobacteria with mucilage, was associated with reduced values of electrical conductance and alterations in pH. The predominance of filamentous species with heterocyst (MBFG III) occurs only during the hydrodynamic stability period and did not show significant association with analyzed parameters. The co-dominance of MBGFs III, V and VII along with high species diversity of phytoplankton community occurred during the second hydrodynamic instability period which was associated with the reduction in water temperature. It is concluded that the decrease in cyanobacterial species dominance and the general increase in the diversity of phytoplankton community are influenced by pluvial anomaly. The higher water level during the period of pluvial anomaly resulted in nutrient pulse and the mixing of water column in the reservoir, which determined the MBPG phytoplankton community distribution.					; Rocha, Odete/D-3473-2012	Chellappa, Naithirithi/0000-0003-3463-029X; Chellappa, Sathyabama/0000-0002-3815-9100; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				AUG	2015	75	3					628	637		10.1590/1519-6984.19513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.19513								26465725					WOS:000362733300015
J	Trudeau, MP; Richardson, M				Trudeau, M. P.; Richardson, Murray			Change in event-scale hydrologic response in two urbanizing watersheds of the Great Lakes St Lawrence Basin 1969-2010	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The cumulative impacts of urban land use change on natural stream flow regimes and lotic ecosystems are poorly understood, and generally under-studied within the hydrologic sciences literature. Moreover, flow assessments using daily or monthly flows cannot adequately characterize long-term trends in event-scale flow dynamics in urbanizing watersheds. Accordingly, we analyzed high temporal resolution (15-min flows) growing season discharge records for two urbanizing watersheds in Canada's Great Lakes Basin, the Don and Humber, over a 42-year period. Results show that total discharge between May 26th and November 15th in the mainstem rivers has increased by about 45%, independent of total rainfall depth, over four decades. Peak rain event flow rates have increased by almost 0.1 m(3) s(-1) yr(-1) in both watersheds and event flow variability has increased two-fold in the Don and almost five-fold in the Humber. In the Don, the ratio of rising limb event flows to median flow (for the period May 26 to November 15) increased from 1.5 in the 1970's to 2.3 in the 2000's. A similar comparison of ratios in the Humber showed similar results, with higher variation in flow response Rising limb event flow acceleration increased 2-fold over 4 decades in the Don and slightly more in the Humber. This study provides a new understanding of the changes in event-scale flow regime dynamics associated with over four decades of intensive urbanization, including increased magnitude of rising limb flows and flow acceleration, and systematic increases in the variability of peak discharges. Overall, our analysis demonstrates marked alteration in total and event flow regimes resulting in chronic perturbation of stream flows. The results demonstrate an important application of long-term, high temporal resolution hydrological records. Furthermore, we quantify the degree to which hydrologic stationarity within the Don and Humber watersheds has been compromised over four decades, during a period prior to detectable climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns.

J	Willwerth, JJ; Reynolds, AG; Lesschaeve, I				Willwerth, James J.; Reynolds, Andrew G.; Lesschaeve, Isabelle			Sensory Analysis of Riesling Wines from Different Sub-Appellations in the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE												Potential terroir effects are described that might impact Riesling wine varietal character. In 2005, the Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario created putative sub-appellations within the Niagara Peninsula based on soil and climate. The objective of this research was to determine differences that might validate sub-appellation designations. It was hypothesized that differences in fruit composition and wine sensory attributes would be found among these sub-appellations. This was tested in 10 commercial Riesling vineyards representative of each sub-appellation from which wines were made in 2005 and 2006. Vineyards were delineated using GPS and 75 to 80 sentinel vines were georeferenced within a sampling grid. An assumption was that vine water status would play a major role in the terroir effect; therefore, wines were made from vines of similar water status based on leaf water potential. A standard winemaking protocol was used to minimize enological effects. Descriptive analysis using a trained panel indicated that sub-appellation affected wine sensory profiles for both vintages. Thirteen aroma, flavor, and taste attributes differed among sub-appellations in 2005 and 11 aroma, flavor, and taste attributes differed in 2006. In both vintages, musts and wines also differed among sub-appellations in chemical composition (titratable acidity, pH, and free and potentially volatile terpenes). Through principal component analysis and partial least squares regression, specific sensory and chemical attributes and vineyard variables were associated with wines from the different sub-appellations. However, wines were grouped by their generalized regional designation (Lakeshore, Escarpment, or Lake Plain) within the Niagara Peninsula. Similar sensory profiles were found in these appellations, suggesting wines classified by their place of origin on the Niagara Peninsula should exhibit specific varietal characteristics regardless of growing season.

The occurrences of filamentous cyanobacteria blooms in such reservoirs add additional costs for water plants by decreasing the filtration efficiency and the potential of toxin production. To serve the purpose of drinking water supply, the effective risk assessment requires the dynamic pattern of filamentous cyanobacteria. This study seasonally collected samples from 25 reservoirs in Dongguan, one of the most important 'world factories' in China in July, December and March, and investigated the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton, particularly cyanobacteria community. Our investigation showed that filamentous cyanobacteria, Planktothrix sp, Limnothrix sp. and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii dominated in these reservoirs and climate-related water temperature was the primary factor for the seasonal shift of filamentous cyanobacteria. High abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria occurred in the high water level period with increasing temperature but less relevant with nutrient conditions. Our study observed the seasonal dynamics of filamentous cyanobacteria in tropical urban reservoirs and highlighted the association between temperature and filamentous cyanobacteria. our data and analysis provided an evidence that increased temperature could increase the likelihood of frequency and intensity of filamentous cyanobacteria blooms. In the scenario of global warming, more frequent monitoring of filamentous cyanobacteria and the potential to produce toxin should be considered for water quality and reservoir management.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				AUG	2020	29	6			SI		780	789		10.1007/s10646-020-02189-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02189-1		MAR 2020						32185603					WOS:000520617700001

Pre-Hispanic agricultural decline prior to the Spanish Conquest in southern Central America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Archeological and paleoenvironmental records from southern Central America attribute population collapse to the Spanish Conquest about 500 years ago. Paleoclimate records from the circum-Caribbean have shown evidence of severe, regional droughts that contributed to the collapse of the Mayan Civilization, but there are few records of these droughts in southern Central America and no records of their effects on prehistoric populations in the region. Here we present a high-resolution lake sediment record of prehistoric agricultural activities using bulk sediment stable carbon isotopes from Laguna Zoncho, Costa Rica. We find isotopic evidence that agriculture was nearly absent from the watershed approximately 220 years prior to the Spanish arrival in Costa Rica and identify two distinct periods of agricultural decline, 1150-970 and 860-640 cal yr BP, which correspond to severe droughts in central Mexico. We attribute decreases in agriculture to a weakened Central American monsoon, which would have shortened the growing season at Laguna Zoncho, reduced crop yields, and negatively affected prehistoric populations.

Study focus: After implementing the optimal noise reduction strategies based on wavelet transform for the high-frequency monitoring data, hybrid models coupling random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks were employed to simulate the dissolved oxygen in the lake during both the open-water and ice-covered periods. The optimal hybrid model for each period was selected through extensive analysis, and the shapley additive explanations method was utilized to quantify the contribution of feature variables to the results. New hydrological insight for the region: The results revealed MAE, RMSE, and NSE values of 0.76, 1.01, and 0.92 for WT-RF, and 0.42, 0.55, and 0.84 for WT-SVM. They represent the optimal hybrid models for the open-water and ice-covered periods, respectively. The SHAP analysis showed that water temperature, blue-green algae, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, and chlorophyll.a exhibited significant importance in the WT-RF model, in that order. BGA and Chl.a synergistically promoted the increase in DO levels during the open-water period. For the WT-SVM model, Chl.a, BGA, Tur, and Temp exhibited significant contributions to the simulation results in that order. However, only BGA was able to enhance DO levels during the ice-covered period. As seasons change, shifts in key water environment factors affecting DO reveal the complexity of lake ecosystems in a cold and arid region.

Palaeogeographic reconstruction of Minchin palaeolake system, South America: The influence of astronomical forcing	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Current palaeoclimatic reconstructions for the Rio de la Plata region during the latest Pleistocene (30,000 - 10,000 yr BP) propose dry conditions, with rainfall at the Last Glacial Maximum amounting to one-third of today's precipitation. Despite the consequential low primary productivity inferred, an impressive megafauna existed in the area at that time. Here we explore the influence of the flooding from a huge extinct system of water bodies in the Andean Altiplano as a likely source for wet regimes that might have increased the primary productivity and, hence, the vast number of megaherbivores. The system was reconstructed using specifically combined software resources, including Insola, Global Mapper v13, Surfer and Matlab. Changes in water volume and area covered were related to climatic change, assessed through a model of astronomical forcing that describes the changes in insolation at the top of the atmosphere in the last 50,000 yr BR The model was validated by comparing its results with several proxies (CH4, CO2, D, O-18) from dated cores taken from the ice covering Antarctic lakes Vostok and EPICA Dome C. It is concluded that the Altiplano Lake system drained towards the southeast in the rainy seasons and that it must have been a major source of water for the Parana-Plata Basin, consequently enhancing primary productivity within it.

Distribution, seasonality and putative origin of the non-native red alga Bangia atropurpurea (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bangia atropurpurea was first observed in Lake Erie in 1964 and subsequently spread to the lower Laurentian Great Lakes by the mid to late 1970s. The present study was initiated to examine the recent distribution of B. atropurpurea in the Great Lakes, the seasonal variation of the alga and the putative origin of this species based on DNA sequence analysis. From surveys in 1995 and 2002, this species has clearly spread, with newly identified populations observed in Lakes Huron, Michigan, Georgian Bay and the St. Lawrence River. Morphological analyses showed that Great Lakes populations from individual lakes or neighboring populations did not group together in cluster analyses. Correlation analysis, however, revealed significant relationships between the presence or absence of Bangia among the studied sites with pH and specific conductance as those locations that had stable populations had a mean pH and conductance of 8.2 and 353 mu S.cm(-1) respectively. Seasonal variation in morphology of a population from Burlington, Ontario (Lake Ontario, Canada) was examined monthly for one year. Maximum filament length occurred in April, with the greatest diameter and archaeospore production observed in May. Significant correlations were also noted for many morphological characteristics with water temperature, population height on the shoreline relative to the waterline and total phosphorus. Collections of B. atropurpurea analyzed from the Great Lakes were observed to be identical in sequence to collections of European freshwater Bangia in the cox2-3 gene spacer, the nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5.8S rRNA gene (between the small and large subunits of the rRNA gene). These results suggest a recent European origin; however, further global collections of B. atropurpurea and microsatellite analyses are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

Laminae couplets comprise dark, terrigenous-dominated half couplets, interpreted as low density underflows deposited from riverine sources during the rainy season, alternating with light, planktonic diatomaceous ooze, with little terrigenous component, interpreted as windy/dry season deposits. Laminated portions of the studied cores consist of conspicuous dark and light colored bundles of laminae couplets. Light and dark bundles alternate at decadal time scales. Within dark bundles, both light and dark half couplets are significantly thinner than within light bundles, implying slower sediment accumulation rates during both seasons over those intervals. Time series analyses of laminae thickness patterns demonstrate significant periodicities at interannual-centennial time scales. Longer time scale periodicities (multidecadal to centennial scale) of light and dark half couplet thicknesses are coherent and in some cases are similar to solar cycle periods on these time scales. Although laminae thickness cycles do not strongly covary with the actual Delta C-14 record for this same time period, two large Delta C-14 anomalies are associated with substantial decreases in both light and dark laminae thickness. In contrast to the multidecadal-centennial time scale, significant annual to decadal periodicities, which are broadly consistent with ENSO/PDO forcing and their impact on East African climate, are not coherent between light and dark half couplets. The coherency of light-dark couplets at decadal-centennial time scales, but not at shorter time scales, is consistent with a model of a long-term relationship between precipitation (recorded in wet season dark laminae thickness) and productivity (light laminae thickness), which is not manifest at shorter time scales. We hypothesize that this coupling results from long-term recharging of internal nutrient loading during wet periods (higher erosion of soil P) and reduced loading during drought intervals. The relationship is not expressed on short time scales during which the dominant control on productivity is wind-driven, dry season upwelling, which is uncorrelated with wet-season precipitation. Our record greatly extends the temporal record of this quasi-periodic behavior throughout the late Holocene and provides the first evidence linking decade- to century-scale episodes of enhanced productivity to enhanced precipitation levels and nutrient recharge in a productive tropical lake.					; Ellis, Geoffrey/G-8970-2011; Cole, Julia/ABA-5759-2020; Blaauw, Maarten/E-4539-2011; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Ellis, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4519-3320; Eagle, Meagan/0000-0001-5072-2755; Blaauw, Maarten/0000-0002-5680-1515; Cole, Julia/0000-0002-3389-7809													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2006	36	2					189	209		10.1007/s10933-006-9004-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9004-y													WOS:000240797600006

Decreased reproductive investment of female threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus infected with the cestode Schistocephalus solidus:: parasite adaptation, host adaptation, or side effect?	OIKOS												Parasitic infections may cause alterations in host life history, including changes in reproductive investment (absolute amount of energy allocated to reproduction) and reproductive effort (proportion of available energy allocated to reproduction). Such changes in host life history may reflect: 1) a parasite tactic: the parasite adaptively manipulates energy flow within the host so that the host is induced to make a reduction in reproductive effort and reproductive investment, making more energy available to the parasite; 2) no tactic: there is no change in host reproductive effort and reproductive investment simply decreases as a side effect of the parasite depleting host energy stores; 3) a host tactic: the host adaptively increases reproductive effort in the face of infection and loss of body condition, reproductive investment possibly being reduced despite the increased reproductive effort. Females in Alaskan lake populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are capable of clutch production when parasitized by the cestode Schistocephalus solidus despite large relative parasite masses. We analyzed the somatic energy reserves, maturation stage and ovarian mass of female sticklebacks collected from an Alaska lake during a single reproductive season. We found that parasitized females were less likely to carry fully-matured gametes, had smaller ovarian masses, and had lower somatic energy stores than unparasitized females. The relationship between reproductive investment and energy storage did not differ between parasitized and unparasitized females. Thus, reproductive effort did not change in response to parasitic infection. We conclude there was no indication of either a parasite tactic or a host tactic. Simple nutrient theft is involved in the parasite's influence on host reproduction, consistent with an earlier hypothesis that reproductive curtailment in threespine sticklebacks is a side effect.

Spatial and temporal distribution of methane in an extensive shallow estuary, south India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE					2nd Annual Meeting of the Asia-Oceania-Geosciences-Society	JUN 20-24, 2005	Singapore, SINGAPORE					Sedimentary methane (CH4) fluxes and oxidation rates were determined over the wet and dry seasons (four measurement campaigns) in Pulicat lake, an extensive shallow estuary in south India. Dissolved CH4 concentrations were measured at 52 locations in December 2000. The annual mean net CH4 lflux from Pulicat lake sediments was 3.7 x 10(9) g yr(-1) based on static chamber measurements. A further 1.7 x 10(9) g yr(-1) was estimated to be oxidized at the sediment-water interface. The mean dissolved concentration of CH4 was 242 nmol l(-1) (ranging between 94 and 501 nmol l(-1)) and the spatial distribution could be explained by tidal dynamics and freshwater input. Sea-air exchange estimates using models account only for similar to 13% (0.5 x 10(9) g yr(-1)) of the total CH4 pro- duced in sediments, whereas ebullition appeared to be the major route for loss to the atmosphere similar to 63% of the net sediment flux). We estimated the total atmospheric source of CH4 from Pulicat lake to be 0.5 to 4.0 x 10(9) yr(-1).					; Ramachandran, Ramesh/B-4814-2018; Ramachandran, Purvaja/K-5522-2018	Ramachandran, Ramesh/0000-0003-2471-7746; 													2347-4327	0973-774X				AUG	2006	115	4					451	460		10.1007/BF02702873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02702873													WOS:000239975100007
J	Muresan, B; Cossa, D; Richard, S; Dominique, Y				Muresan, Bogdan; Cossa, Daniel; Richard, Sandrine; Dominique, Yannick			Monomethylmercury sources in a tropical artificial reservoir	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The distribution and speciation of mercury (Hg) in the water column, the inputs (wet deposition and tributaries) and the outputs (atmospheric evasion and outlet) of an artificial partially anoxic tropical lake (Petit-Sa-Lit reservoir, French Guiana) were investigated oil a seasonal basis in order to appraise the cycling and transformations of this metal. The total mercury (HgT) concentrations in the oxygenated epilimnetic waters averaged 5 +/- 3 pmol L-1 in the unfiltered samples (HgTUNF) and 4 +/- 2 pmol L-1 in the dissolved (HgTD) phase (< 0.45 mu m). On average, the monomethylmercury (MMHg) constituted 8%, 40%, and 18% of the HgT in the dissolved phase, tile particulate suspended matter and in tile unfiltered samples, respectively. Covariant elevated concentrations of particulate MMHg and chlorophyll a in the epilimnion suggest that phytoplankton is ail active component for the MMHg transfer in tile lake. In the anoxic hypolimnion the HgTUNF averages 13 +/- 6 pmol L-1 and tile HgTD 8 +/- 4 pmol L-1. The averages of MMHgP and MMHgD in hypolimnetic waters were two and three times the corresponding values of the epilimnion, 170 +/- 90 pmol g(-1) and 0.9 +/- 0.5 pmol L-1, respectively. In the long dry and wet seasons, at the flooded forest and upstream dam sampling stations, the vertical profiles of MMHgD concentrations accounted for two distinct maxima: one just below the oxycline and the other near the benthic interface. Direct wet atmospheric deposition accounted for 14 moles yr(-1) HgTUNF, with 0.7 moles yr(-1) as MMHgUNF, while circa 76 moles yr(-1) of HgTUNF, with 4.7 moles yr(-1) as MMHgUNF, coming from tributaries. Circa 78 moles (similar to 17% as MMHg) are annually exported through tile dam, while 23 moles yr(-1) of Hg-0 evolve in the atmosphere. A mass balance calculation suggests that the endogenic production of MMHgUNF attained 8.1 moles yr(-1), corresponding to a methylation rate of 0.06% d(-1). As a result, tile Petit-Saut reservoir is a large man-made reactor that has extensively altered mercury speciation in favor of methylated species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examined the factors associated with high but suboptimal compliance levels at facilities with available malaria tests and drugs. Methods Data from four national, cross-sectional health facility surveys undertaken between 2014 and 2016 in Kenya were analysed. Association between 31 factors and compliance with malaria testing (survey range (SR): 65-69%) and no anti-malarial treatment for test negative patients (SR: 90-92%) were examined using multilevel logistic regression models. Results A total of 2,752 febrile patients seen by 594 health workers at 486 health facilities were analysed. Higher odds of malaria testing were associated with lake endemic (aOR = 12.12; 95% CI: 5.3-27.6), highland epidemic (aOR = 5.06; 95% CI: 2.7-9.5) and semi-arid seasonal (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.2-3.6) compared to low risk areas; faith-based (FBO)/ non-governmental organization (NGO)-owned compared to government-owned facilities (aOR = 5.80; 95% CI: 3.2-10.6); health workers' perception of malaria endemicity as high-risk (aOR = 3.05; 95% CI: 1.8-5.2); supervision with feedback (aOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.2-2.9); access to guidelines (aOR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.1-3.4); older patients compared to infants, higher temperature measurements and main complaints of fever, diarrhoea, headache, vomiting and chills. Lower odds of testing were associated with febrile patients having main complaints of a cough (aOR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.5-0.9), a rash (aOR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.2-0.7) or a running nose (aOR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). Other factors associated with compliance with test negative results included the type of diagnostic test available at the facility, in-service training, health workers' age, and correct knowledge of the targeted treatment policy. Conclusions To optimize outpatient malaria case-management, reduce testing compliance gaps and eliminate overtreatment of test negative patients, there is a need to focus on compliance within low malaria risk areas in addition to ensuring the universal and continuous availability of 'test and treat' commodities. Targeting of older and government health workers; dissemination of updated guidelines; and continuing with in-service training and supportive supervision with feedback is essential. Lastly, there is a need to improve health workers' knowledge about malaria testing criteria considering their perceptions of endemicity.					; Snow, Robert/AFR-1436-2022	Snow, Robert/0000-0003-3725-6088; Amboko, Beatrice/0000-0002-5754-3853														1475-2875				MAR 3	2022	21	1							68	10.1186/s12936-022-04093-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-022-04093-x								35241074					WOS:000764062800004
J	Koszelnik, P; Bartoszek, L				Koszelnik, Piotr; Bartoszek, Lilianna			Influence of Sedimentary Fe and Mn on the Oxygenation of Overlying Waters in Dam Reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper reports the work to determine the impact that concentrations of manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in the bottom sediments of shallow dam reservoirs exert upon the dissolved oxygen concentrations of overlying waters. Specifically, the work was conducted in the period of 2013-2014 in six shallow artificial reservoirs located in SE Poland. The waters of all the reservoirs studied are relatively well oxygenated, though both supersaturation and anoxic conditions are observed seasonally across the 50-150% range. The reported reactions of bottom sediments were between pH 7.7 and 8.2, while the mean concentrations of Mn and Fe were found to vary widely from site to site (Mn from 0.068 to 1.48 g/kg d.w. and Fe from 2.48 to 24.0 g/kg d.w.). It was not possible to demonstrate any direct relationship between sediment Fe and Mn concentrations, the Mn/Fe ratio or pH on the one hand and the oxygenation of reservoir waters on the other. However, multiple regression analysis did allow for the identification of a significant influence of both Mn content and sediment pH on the oxygen concentration in reservoir waters. In simple terms, both an increase in Mn and a decrease in pH can be said to result in more fully aerobic conditions in waters.

J	Tchindjang, M				Tchindjang, Mesmin			Lake Nyos, a Multirisk and Vulnerability Appraisal	GEOSCIENCES												Situated at the northern flank of the Oku Massif, Lake Nyos crater epitomizes landscape features originating from volcanic explosions during the Quaternary. The Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), to which it belongs, constitutes the most active volcanic region in Cameroon. In 1986, an outgas explosion occurred from beneath the lake and killed 1746 people in several neighbouring villages. The event influenced a radial area of 25 to 40 km wide, particularly in eastern and western direction. This was mainly due to: (1) the rugged nature of the landscape (fault fields), which enabled the heavier gas to follow valleys framed by faults corridors without affecting elevated areas; and (2) the seasonal dominating western wind direction, which channeled the gas along tectonic corridors and valleys. This paper assesses the geological risk and vulnerability in the Lake Nyos before and after several proposal to mitigate future outgas events. Remotely sensed data, together with GIS tools (topographic maps, aerial photographs), helped to determine and assess lineaments and associated risks. A critical grid combining severity and frequency analysis was used to assess the vulnerability of the local population. There is evidence that along the main fault directions (SW-NE), anthropogenic activities are most intensive and they may play an aggravating role for disasters. This requires the local population's consciousness-raising. The results also show that population around Lake Nyos still remains vulnerable to volcanic hazards and floods. However, the area has been safe since the last degassing and jet grouting through multiple procedures and actions proposed in the National Contingency Plan, and equally by the relief organization plan (DROP or ORSEC plan) for the Menchum Division. Another issue is that the local population is concerned with the idea of returning to the affected areas in order to stay close to their ancestors or the deceased. Therefore, even after jet grouting and degassing, the problem of risk minimization for local residents remains.					; Tchindjang, Mesmin/F-9247-2011	TCHINDJANG, Mesmin/0000-0002-3129-1467; 														2076-3263				SEP	2018	8	9							312	10.3390/geosciences8090312	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8090312													WOS:000448335800004

The uptake of terrestrial vegetation and riverine phytoplankton are the key process controlling DSi migration within the drainage basin. Anthropogenic activities (including land use change and damming) have been altering DSi export by changing biological uptakes in the basin. A significant artificial lake effect of damming was exhibited on the spatial variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) and DSi, which caused 15.39% of riverine DSi to be detained in the reservoir region of Changhuajiang River basin, Hainan Island, China. The biological uptake of terrestrial vegetation was behindhand responsible for seasonal fluctuations of DSi. The DSi uptake yields ranged from 19.44 t/km(2)/yr to 86.76 t/km(2)/yr during the different terrestrial vegetation types in the basin, in turn, tropical rainforest > crops > artificial economic forests > grassland. The try calculating of the DSi yield released by the silicates weathering was carried out taking biological processes in the basin into account. Taking into the plants uptake within the basin consideration, the corrected DSi yield from the silicates weathering was 18.6 t/km(2)/yr. Accordingly, the silicates weathering rate was up to 41.55 t/km(2)/yr, which was 1.36 times higher than that (30.39 t/km(2)/yr) without consideration of the biological uptake, and close to the fastest weathering rate of the granite basin (Puerto Rico) in the earth surface. Of the DSi released by the silicates weathering, 28.56% was absorbed by terrestrial vegetation, and 31.43% was consumed by riverine phytoplankton, and the rest was drainaged into the South China Sea.

Defining a spatial scale for new management strategies has become increasingly important due to rapid expansion of the sport fishery. To investigate life history characteristics, migratory pathways, and space use, we used telemetry to monitor the movement behavior of flathead catfish and blue catfish during two complete annual cycles. Individuals were sampled from a 97-km reach of the lower Missouri River and surgically implanted with transmitters during April 2006 (N = 77) and again in April and July of 2007 (N = 80). Acoustic tracking by boat and radio tracking by helicopter were used on the Missouri, Lamine, Chariton, Little Chariton, and Grand rivers during 2006-2008. The proportion of individuals that used a tributary during the putative spawning period (May 15 July 15) increased from 10% (8 of 77) in 2006 to 18% (14 of 80) in 2007. Flood conditions in May 2007 may have contributed to this increase. Between April 2006 and May 2007, the majority of flathead (51%) and blue catfishes (55%) moved less than 100 river kilometers from where they were tagged. The maximum linear range during 2006-2007 was 347.6 river kilometers for blue catfish and 751.9 river kilometers for flathead catfish. Seasonal structure to annual movements was evident with periods of both restricted movement (December March; July September) and migratory behavior (March June; October December). The variability in observed behaviors provides a substantial basis for managers to identify and protect distant habitats that are used by adult catfish for spawning, feeding and growth, and overwintering.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7				2011	77						495	509																WOS:000393725100041

The DGGE patterns grouped as a function of environmental characteristics describing the trophic status of the lakes, such as total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), TN:TP, chlorophyll a, Secchi depth and water colour. Most sequences retrieved represented Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, while those representing Alpha-and Gamma-proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria were less frequent. The presence of several sequences could be linked to the trophic status of the lakes, while that of others was more common and thus unrelated to the trophic status. These results suggest that individual responses towards environmental factors may occur among the bacterioplankton at the level of phyla as well as phylotypes.

Temporal trends of phytoplankton and zooplankton stable isotope composition in tropical Lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stable isotope ratios of three seston size classes (20-100 mu m, 2-20 mu m, and 0.2-2 mu m) and zooplankton species were analyzed to determine the plankton food web structure of lake Malawi. Over an annual cycle, seston delta C-13 varied between -20.41 parts per thousand and -27.43 parts per thousand with a mean value of -24.27 parts per thousand +/- 1.2 while delta C-13 values for zooplankton fluctuated between -22 parts per thousand and -25 parts per thousand with a mean of -23.84 parts per thousand +/- 0.77. Seston delta C-13 fluctuations appeared to be related to changes in physical and meteorological conditions in the lake that ultimately control nutrient availability. The highest seston delta C-13 values observed during the rainy and mixed seasons likely result from high phytolankton growth rates. delta N-15 of plankton was temporally variable, suggesting short term changes in N cycling dynamics that control the supply of N to phytoplankton. Very low seston delta N-15 values recorded during the mixing season suggest excess NO3- availability resulting from upwelling and vertical mixing. In contrast to expectations the calanoid Tropodiaptomus cunningtoni appeared to feed at a trophic level higher than that of all other zooplankton species, including the cyclopoid, Mesocyclops aequatorialis aequatorialis. delta N-15 values indicate that zooplankton were nearly 2 trophic levels above seston in the early stratified season. This implies that adult zooplankton could be utilizing forms of food other than phytoplankton during this period, such as nauplii or protozoans. This extra step in the food web, and the trophic positions of large zooplankton species, may alter estimates of food web efficiency and potential fish production for Lake Malawi.

We sampled Chinook salmon and stickleback diets monthly and over a diel cycle in spatially distinct emergent marshes of the Columbia River estuary. Diets of the two fish species did not differ among marsh systems, but both fish species exhibited diel and seasonal differences in diet composition. Diet overlap between the two fish species was greatest in March and June. Exploitative competition was unlikely based on a comparison between consumption rates and estimated invertebrate production.																			1559-2723					JAN	2011	34	1					159	171		10.1007/s12237-010-9349-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-010-9349-3													WOS:000287155800013

Retrieval results showed that the East DTL was in case II waters in the past several years. Furthermore, COD concentration near the coast is higher than in deep waterway, for the water flows much more rapidly in deep waterway than near the coast. The annual changes of the COD concentration in East DTL increased significantly from 1993 to 1999, but the change from 1999 to 2006 in extremely dry seasons is very small.

J	Chen, BF; Chen, YZ; Chen, HM				Chen, Baofeng; Chen, Yunzhi; Chen, Hongmei			An Interpretable CatBoost Model Guided by Spectral Morphological Features for the Inversion of Coastal Water Quality Parameters	WATER												Chlorophyll-a (Chla) and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations are important parameters for water quality assessment, and in recent years, machine learning has been shown to have great potential in this field. However, current water quality parameter inversion models lack interpretability and rarely consider the morphological characteristics of the spectrum. To address this limitation, we used Sentinel-3 OLCI data to construct an interpretable CatBoost model guided by spectral morphological characteristics for remote sensing monitoring of Chla and TSS along the coast of Fujian. The results show that the coastal waters of Fujian Province can be divided into five clusters, and the areas of different clusters will change with the alternation of seasons. Clusters 2 and 4 are the main types of coastal waters. The CatBoost model combined with spectral feature engineering has a high accuracy in predicting Chla and TSS, among which Chla is slightly better than TSS (R2 = 0.88, MSE = 8.21, MAPE = 1.10 for Chla predictions; R2 = 0.77, MSE = 380.49, MAPE = 2.48 for TSS predictions). We further conducted an interpretability analysis on the model output and found that the combination of BRI and TBI indexes composed of bands such as b8, b9, and b10 and the fluctuation of spectral curves will have a significant impact on the prediction of model output. The interpretable CatBoost model based on spectral morphological features proposed in this study can provide an effective technical means of estimating the chlorophyll-a and total suspended particulate matter concentrations in the coastal areas of Fujian.					; Chen, Hongmei/T-9222-2017	Chen, Baofeng/0009-0006-1907-8352; 														2073-4441				DEC	2024	16	24							3615	10.3390/w16243615	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16243615													WOS:001386757400001

Hence, this study focuses on the spatiotemporal variations of ionic concentrations of shallow groundwater in an estuarine delta of GanXiu River in Poyang Lake watershed, which is greatly complicated by complex hydrological regimes and intensive anthropogenic activities such as cropland fertilizer. The potential factors controlling the ionic concentrations were identified using self-organizing map clustering and Piper diagram approaches. Moreover, the overall water quality of shallow groundwater was assessed according to the ionic compositions.

However, the spatiotemporal open water extent (OWE) during this drought remains unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates OWE variability in the central Amazon using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data since 2017. Monthly OWE masks were generated through an empirical threshold classification with accuracy >95%. Overall, the central Amazon experienced a reduction of similar to 8% in OWE in the 2023 dry season months (November and December) when compared to monthly-average. However, reductions of up to 80% in OWE were observed in several specific lakes. Our analysis underscores the unprecedented severity of the 2023/2024 drought on rivers and floodplains. Utilizing SAR remote sensing technologies, this study emphasizes the urgent need for proactive conservation measures to safeguard the Amazon's ecological integrity amid escalating environmental challenges.

Lake eutrophication, marked by intensified and prolonged cyanobacterial blooms, significantly impacts material and energy cycling processes, potentially altering the ecological traits of both free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacteria. However, the extent to which observed patterns of FL and PA bacterial diversity, community assembly, and stability extend to hypereutrophic lakes remains understudied. To address this gap, we investigated bacterial diversity, composition, assembly processes, and stability within hypereutrophic Lake Xingyun. Our results revealed that FL bacterial communities exhibited higher alpha-diversity than PA counterparts, coupled with discernible taxonomic compositions. Both bacterial communities showed distinct seasonality, influenced by cyanobacterial bloom intensity. Environmental factors accounted for 71.1% and 54.2% of the variation among FL and PA bacteria, respectively. The assembly of the PA bacterial community was predominantly stochastic, while FL assembly was more deterministic. The FL network demonstrated greater stability, complexity, and negative interactions, indicative of competitive relationships, while the PA network showed a prevalence of positive correlations, suggesting mutualistic interactions. Importantly, these findings differ from observations in oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic lakes. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the interplay among bacterial fractions, enhancing our understanding of nutrient status and cyanobacterial blooms in shaping bacterial communities.

The present study focuses on sediment texture within the beach-dune systems corresponding to an arcuate and a straight beach of Bakkhali and Talsari region, respectively. Multivariate statistical approach has been used to identify the end members and their proportion contributing to the grain size composition of the beach-dune system. To support the end members with a meaningful geological significance, discriminant analysis for depositional environments and CM plot for its dynamics are substantiated. The beach-dune system of Bakkhali shows appreciable homogenization of samples as compared to the Talsari region. In the Bakkhali beach an average of 0.238 m/year erosion and average rate of accretion is 0.423 m/year while in Talsari beach it is 0.238 m/year and 0.302 m/year, respectively. The end-member (EM) modelling showed relatively high contributions of medium- to fine-sand (ranging similar to 2.0 to 3.5 Phi) along with a minor amount of fines. Our study clarifies that grain size population exerts the primary control on erosion-accretion whilst hydraulic effects of wave and wind contribute to its spatial distribution. Since the particular size is lost from the system which needs to be replenished otherwise it disturbs the beach equilibrium. This study also bears its importance for beach nourishment as the end member analysis serves as a guide to replenish a beach with the required types of sediment grain sizes and search for its specific source areas. This work will also pave the way for advanced coastal resilience programs and climate adaptation planning and provide a platform for policymakers, technological innovators, the industry and researchers for coastal hazard mitigation and will ensure decision-makers regarding the execution of the plans on the ground.					; Mondal, Subhronil/V-7796-2019	patra, uttam kumar/0000-0002-2840-1530; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2022	81	5							147	10.1007/s12665-022-10276-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10276-1													WOS:000758874100004

This study investigates landscape controls on hydrologic response by conducting a catchment classification of 26 catchments located within two Precambrian Shield watersheds (Sturgeon-French-Nipissing [SNF] and Muskoka) in central and Northeastern Ontario, Canada, using combinations of landscape characteristics (e.g. topography, geology, landcover), hydrometric variables, and stable isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in river flow. Weekly to monthly surveys of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in river flow were collected between 2013 and 2019. Flow metrics (e.g. Parde coefficient and coefficient of variation of streamflow) were generated for 14 of the 26 rivers between 2008 and 2018. Principal component analyses (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) analyses were used to identify variables controlling catchment clustering according to their similarities for four different scenarios. Despite their similar location along the southern edge of the Precambrian Shield, the 26 catchments generally clustered by watershed (SNF and Muskoka) with some exceptions. Differences in wetland and lake area (%), mean slope, and % area covered by glacialacustrine and glaciofluvial outwash deposits were the most influential variables in catchment classification. A positive correlation between % wetland area and streamflow stable isotope damping ratios suggests greater % wetland area (with shallow and potentially seasonally variable surface areas and/or hydrologic connection) observed in the SNF catchments increases variability in the influence of evaporative enrichment in SNF catchments. The catchment classification analyses in combination with stable isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2 were functional tools to investigate the combined influences of diverse types of catchment characteristics that lead to differences in hydrometric response. These results could support future studies focusing on generating hydrologic models and representing wetlands connectivity in the region.					; Stadnyk, Tricia/ABC-8061-2021; James, April/D-1415-2012	Stadnyk, Tricia/0000-0002-2145-4963; James, April Lynda/0000-0002-1741-5101; Tafvizi, Arghavan/0000-0001-8880-4246; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR	2022	36	3							e14528	10.1002/hyp.14528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14528													WOS:000774895000010

Therefore, the government of Cambodia has decided to move the floating houses in Chhnok Tru to the upland regions, and more than 90% of the floating houses in Chhnok Tru have already been moved in accordance with the government's plan. However, the scientific information on water quality before and after moving the floating houses in Tonle Sap Lake is limited. Thus, this paper aimed to evaluate differences in basic water quality such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), conductivity (Cond), and nitrate (NO3-) before and after the floating houses were moved and to reveal the relationships between the floating houses and basic water quality. The water quality parameters were measured at 18 sampling sites in Chhnok Tru using an EXO sensor and NO3- was analyzed by ion chromatography (IC). Statistical analyses such as t-tests, correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used. The results show that the water quality was better after moving the floating houses; however, some parts of the study area were still polluted. In addition, the percentage of floating house distribution was significantly correlated with the temperature and ORP in the study area during dry and wet seasons. The obtained results are useful for making management decisions to sustainably manage the water quality in the area.					; Chhin, Rattana/AAR-3985-2021; EANG, Khy/N-7459-2019; Wai, May Phue/JGD-2806-2023	CHEM, Vibol/0000-0001-6162-2047; Siev, Sokly/0000-0002-1916-1598; 														2071-1050				MAR	2022	14	5							2747	10.3390/su14052747	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052747													WOS:000768751700001

Drivers of highly diverse planktonic ciliate assemblages in peat bog pools from Tierra del Fuego (Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Peatlands often encompass shallow pools, wherein dystrophic and colored acid waters host a remarkably diverse biota, with ciliates likely playing a key role in their short trophic webs. In the Sphagnum magellanicum-dominated Rancho Hambre peat bog, a 2-year study was conducted in five pools with different morphometric and trophic characteristics, in order to identify main environmental variables driving ciliate species richness, abundance, biomass, and diversity. Overall species richness (125 taxa) was much higher than in northern Hemisphere counterparts. Deep minerotrophic pools hosted the richest communities, showing similar seasonal abundance patterns and the highest species turnover. Although all pools shared the same dominant ciliates, similarity in taxonomic composition among them was generally low (J = 0.22-0.35). Moreover, IndVal analysis showed that rare and occasional species were highly indicative of different pools. Euryoecious, heterotrophic species, occurred in all sites, while mixotrophs were typical from shallow ombrotrophic pools. Rimostrombidium hyalinum was the most indicative species of a deep ombrotrophic pool. A CCA revealed that the abundances of potential ciliate preys, i.e., picophytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and heterotrophic flagellates, were the most significant regulators of abundances of this group. Therefore, ciliate structure and dynamics were influenced by pool morphometry and physical and chemical features, but foremost by interactions with other plankton communities.					; Quiroga, Maria/JUV-5976-2023	Mataloni, Gabriela/0000-0002-6852-6143; Quiroga, Maria Victoria/0000-0002-6223-334X													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2016	773	1					117	134		10.1007/s10750-016-2686-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2686-x													WOS:000374979600011

For this purpose, the expert opinions of 133 local fishers were collected during in-person interviews, distilled using categorical data analysis, and checked against scientific literature. The five main results are as follows: manatees were sighted averagely once a week in lakes, rivers, and the coast & estuaries, mostly in group sizes of 2-3; the odds of sighting live manatees (respectively dead manatees) decreased (respectively increased) from inland lakes to estuaries and the coast, via rivers; manatee carcasses were reported in all habitats, albeit more frequently in rivers; a distribution map based on fishers' reports show two manatee concentration areas: Lake Ossa and the Malimba-Mbiako section of River Sanaga; the number of manatees was perceived as increasing despite incidental and directed catches. Thus, our findings corroborate earlier assessments of the Lower Sanaga Basin as being a major manatee conservation area. Additionally, from these results and the literature, we identified three hypotheses about local manatee persistence: deep pools such as lakes offer year round sanctuaries, not just dry-season refugia; seasonality of specific habitat variables determine manatee occurrence patterns; and local variability in habitat encroachment mediate the meta-population dynamics of manatee in the Lower Sanaga Basin. Finally, we examine the implications for data requirements in light of the small ecological scale at which the surveyed fishers ply their trade. Thus, consonant with the Malawi principles for the ecosystem approach to management (www.cbd.int/ecosystem), we recommend collecting data preferably at landscape scale, through a participatory monitoring program that fully integrates scientific and traditional knowledge systems. This program should include, amongst others, a standardised necropsy protocol for collecting mortality and biological data together with sonar and radio-telemetry technology to discern manatee use and movements between critical habitat components.

This study focuses on 17 representative lakes from the site to assess seasonal nutrient dynamics and their connection to plankton metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) during two successive hydrological periods. Effect of environmental factors was evaluated on a combination of several response variables, demonstrating that source of the nutrient inputs (ranging from natural to anthropic) had the highest influence on the nutrients stoichiometry and metabolic rates. Regarding the source of eutrophication, the model demonstrated that effects of urban wastewaters exceed that of agricultural runoff, and moreover lead to more prolonged hydroperiods and contributes to desalination. Lakes affected by wastewater inputs or surrounded by volcanic lithology showed phosphorus enrichment in both water and surface sediments. Planktonic respiration rates in these cases closely correlated with photosynthesis, suggesting the utilization of algal-derived dissolved organic matter. Conversely, wastewater-free lakes, mainly fed by runoff, accumulated uncolored, likely recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These lakes exhibited better-preserved condition, characterized by higher salinity, moderate metabolic rates, and lower production/ respiration ratios compared to the previous state, implying a greater dependence on allochthonous organic matter. Enhancement of management strategies, which should consider salinity, volcanic lake vulnerability, and the multifaceted impacts of wastewater, will prove more effective in the conservation and restoration of these unique and fragile ecosystems.

Seasonal hypoxia and the genetic diversity of prokaryote populations in the central basin hypolimnion of Lake Erie: Evidence for abundant cyanobacteria and photosynthesis	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The reoccurring region of seasonal hypoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie ("the dead zone") has been of significant interest to researchers over the past several years. Surprisingly however, no efforts to characterize the endemic microbial community, responsible.for the consumption of oxygen in this system, have been published. To understand how the microbial community may be interacting with this event, we have begun to characterize microbial members by using molecular tools. Phycoerythrinrich cyanobacteria appear abundant and active in a narrow region (similar to 1.5 m) below the thermocline during hypoxic conditions, reaching abundances of greater than 10(5) mL(-1) and being the primary agent releasing 1.5 mg 02 L-1 above the daytime demands in this region. Sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons, generated with universal eubacterial primer sets, from the Lake Erie's hypolimnion during seasonal oxygen depletion demonstrated that cyanobacteria, most closely related to phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus spp., dominate during rapid drawdown oxygen (0.083 mg L-1 d(-1) in 2004) in this region. Analyses of another conserved marker of phylogeny (RuBisCO) has been used to confirm the presence of these cell types. Numerous distinct taxa of heterotrophic bacteria are also represented in the 16S library. The results of this study suggest that novel groups of cyanobacteria may persist within the Lake Erie dead zone during hypoxic conditions and, along with the heterotrophic community, strongly influence system geochemistry.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008; Rintakanto, Johanna/OMM-4652-2025; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Rinta-Kanto, Johanna/0000-0002-5824-0897; Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; 													0380-1330						2006	32	4					657	671		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[657:SHATGD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[657:SHATGD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243172100001

Effective Nutrient Management of Surface Waters in the United States Requires Expanded Water Quality Monitoring in Agriculturally Intensive Areas	ACS ENVIRONMENTAL AU												The U.S. Clean Water Act is believed to have driven widespread decreases in pollutants from point sources and developed areas, but has not substantially affected nutrient pollution from agriculture. Today, the highest nutrient concentrations in surface waters are often associated with agricultural production. In this Perspective, we explore whether challenges stemming from the Clean Water Act's inability to mitigate agricultural nutrient pollution are also exacerbated by coarse nutrient monitoring. We evaluate the current state of nutrient monitoring in surface waters of the contiguous U.S. relative to agricultural nutrient inputs to assess how monitoring effort varies across agriculturally intensive areas. The locations of nutrient monitoring stations with approximately seasonal sampling frequency (4 samples per year, on average) from 2012 to 2021 were compiled from the U.S. Water Quality Portal. Monitoring station locations were then compared to watershed-scale (HUC-8) nutrient inventory estimates for agricultural fertilizer and livestock manure inputs. From this assessment, we found that many, but not all, of the nation's most agriculturally intensive areas are under-monitored, and often unmonitored. While it is well-known that the Midwest is the epicenter of agricultural production in the U.S., our results reveal it is poorly monitored relative to its agricultural nutrient inputs. Other regions, like the California Central Valley and parts of the southeastern Coastal Plain were also coarsely monitored relative to nutrient inputs. Conversely, some agriculturally intensive watersheds were moderately-to-well monitored (e.g., western Lake Erie basin, eastern North Carolina, and the Delmarva Peninsula), with these basins largely having established Total Maximum Daily Loads and discharging to prominent waterways. In closing, we argue that sparse monitoring across many of the nation's most agriculturally intensive areas motivate a need to re-envision nutrient monitoring networks, and that increased resources and advanced technologies are likely required to enable effective nutrient source identification throughout the nation.

The SLE receives water from an intensively drained watershed through a variety of interconnected swales, ditches, and canals. Specific indicators of oyster health and recruitment included condition index, gonadal index, spat settlement, and infection intensity of Perkinsus marinus. Water pH, salinity, DO, and temperature varied among locations and throughout the seasons. Temperatures were highest (31° C) from June through August and lowest (13° C) in January. Salinity, the most variable parameter, ranged from &LT; 1-30 ppt. Significant depressions in salinity were apparent during Lake Okeechobee discharge events through Canal-44 (C-44) and when long-duration rainfall events occurred within the immediate watershed and the Canal-23 (C-23) and Canal-24 (C-24) drainage basins. Measured DO was generally &GT; 2 mg L-1 and pH ranged from 7-8.5. Spat settlement was always lower in the SLE as compared with reference sites in the Indian River Lagoon. The majority of spat settlement in the SLE occurred from April through June. Gonadal stage of oysters and condition index varied throughout the seasons. This survey will serve as a useful benchmark for measuring the success of future projects directed towards management of water quality and enhancement of oyster habitat in the SLE.																			0730-8000					JAN	2005	24	1					157	165																WOS:000229059200021

To fill the knowledge gap, diffusive CH4 emissions from pen aquaculture and non-aquaculture region of a subtropical shallow lake were studied with 6-year field samplings. Our results found that pen aquaculture had notably lower nutrient loadings and fewer phytoplankton biomass, but emitted larger CH4 to the atmosphere with an annual mean value of 2.75+2.11 mg C m- 2 d- 1, which was higher than that at open water (0.47+0.43 mg C m- 2 d- 1). Although diffusive CH4 emissions was unrelated to nutrient and phytoplankton at pen aquaculture, we did find strong evidence that higher carbon to nitrogen ration linked to the significant emissions, suggesting feed-derived available carbon may regulate emission from the pen aquaculture with shallower water depth. Seasonal increases in temperature led to clear seasonality of diffusive emissions, and further analysis found stronger water temperate dependence of diffusive emissions occurred in pen aquaculture mostly due to organic matter accumulation. Importantly, the CH4 emissions from the pen aquaculture with large size was comparable to those aquaculture ponds with very small size. Our study may offer a powerful example implied lake aquaculture should be considered to accurately estimate human-impacted aquatic CH4 emissions.

We evaluated the efficacy of nonlethal deterrent techniques on 62 bears in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the Sierra Nevada range. We contrasted animals randomly assigned to a control (no treatment) group (n = 21), an experimental (treatment) group (n = 21), or a treatment + dog group (n = 20). Experimental bears were pepper-sprayed, shot with 12-gauge rubber buckshot and a rubber slug, and exposed to cracker shells. Bears in the treatment + dog group were chased by hounds in addition to the combination of other deterrents. We tested and modeled the effectiveness of deterrents and dogs using a survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards and ANOVA. Relative success was evaluated by the latency of time (days) between treatment and return to the urban patch (RUP). Predictor variables in the saturated model included age, weight, season, sex, distance moved, and treatment. Only treatment remained in the most parsimonious model. However, mean number of days until RUP did not vary among the 3 treatment levels (ANOVA, P = 0.55). In all but 5 of 62 cases, bears eventually returned to the urban patch in which they were captured; 33 of 62 bears (53%) returned within I month and 70% (n = 44) of all bears returned in <= 40 days. We conclude that in the Lake Tahoe Basin the most common nonlethal deterrents, used by agencies responsible for black bear management, are not very effective at altering bear behavior over periods of time > 1 month.

J	Hegna, J; Scribner, K; Baker, E				Hegna, Jonathan; Scribner, Kim; Baker, Edward			Movements, habitat use, and entrainment of stocked juvenile lake sturgeon in a hydroelectric reservoir system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Identifying movement and habitat use patterns is essential for fish passage efforts and the conservation of threatened species. We used acoustic telemetry to track the movements of 44 juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) throughout Kleber Reservoir in northern Michigan. On average, lake sturgeon moved 502 m between telemetry positions, with age-2 lake sturgeon moving longer distances than age-1 lake sturgeon. Areas with high numbers of lake sturgeon detections were clustered near the forebay, while zones with low numbers of detections were clustered toward the head of the reservoir. Analyses showed that 66.4% of the variance in habitat use could be explained by physical habitat features. Reservoir areas with ample deepwater habitat, fine soft substrates, and limited macrophyte vegetation were the most frequently occupied and, thus, may provide suitable habitat conditions to support juvenile lake sturgeon. We observed that 54.4% of the age-1 and 52.8% of the age-2 lake sturgeon stocked into Kleber Reservoir were entrained. Reservoir size, morphology, and the location of suitable habitat in relation to hydroelectric infrastructure may be key factors that affect entrainment rates.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2020	77	3					611	624		10.1139/cjfas-2018-0407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0407													WOS:000516746000016
J	Moknatian, M; Piasecki, M				Moknatian, Mahrokh; Piasecki, Michael			Lake Volume Data Analyses: A Deep Look into the Shrinking and Expansion Patterns of Lakes Azuei and Enriquillo, Hispaniola	HYDROLOGY												This paper presents the development of an evenly spaced volume time series for Lakes Azuei and Enriquillo both located on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The time series is derived from an unevenly spaced Landsat imagery data set which is then exposed to several imputation methods to construct the gap filled uniformly-spaced time series so it can be subjected to statistical analyses methods. The volume time series features both gradual and sudden changes the latter of which is attributed to North Atlantic cyclone activity. Relevant cyclone activity is defined as an event passing within 80 km and having regional monthly rainfall averages higher than a threshold value of 87 mm causing discontinuities in the lake responses. Discontinuities are accounted for in the imputation algorithm by dividing the time series into two sub-sections: Before/after the event. Using leave-p-out cross-validation and computing the NRMSE index the Stineman interpolation proves to be the best algorithm among 15 different imputation alternatives that were tested. The final time series features 16-day intervals which is subsequently resampled into one with monthly time steps. Data analyses of the monthly volume change time series show Lake Enriquillo's seasonal periodicity in its behavior and also its sensitivity due to the occurrence of storm events. Response times feature a growth pattern lasting for one to two years after an extreme event, followed by a shrinking pattern lasting 5-7 years returning the lake to its original state. While both lakes show a remarkable long term increase in size starting in 2005, Lake Azuei is different in that it is much less sensitive to storm events and instead shows a stronger response to just changing seasonal rainfall patterns.

Accuracy analysis of process-based models is important to evaluate the reliability of model estimates for different wetlands. In this study, we analyzed the three sources of the model bias from a process-based model (CH4MOD(wetland)) when simulating CH4 emissions from different wetland sites and types in China. On a national scale, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased from 70.6% at daily scale to 27.1% at annual/seasonal scale. On a national scale, more than 90% of the model errors were from random error. At most of the sites random error contributed more than 60% to the model errors, except the Guangzhou, Haikou, Wuliangsu lake and Yancheng Estuary sites, which showed lower RMSE values. The model simulated higher RMSE at the tidal marsh sites. The model had capability to simulate the daily and annual/seasonal CH4 emissions from all wetland types (model efficiency > 0), and performed better for coastal wetlands than peatlands and marshes, with model efficiency values of 0.75 and 0.99, respectively. When applied the model at annual/seasonal scale for peatlands, marshes, and coastal wetlands, the RMSE decreased a lot. The study indicated that CH4MOD(wetland) is more accurate at annual/seasonal scale than daily scale for different wetland types across China. The non-stochastic portion of CH4 emissions from peatlands, marshes and coastal wetlands can be well predicted by the model.

Comment on "Origin of water in the Badain Jaran Desert, China: new insight from isotopes" byWu et al. (2017)	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Precipitation isotope data were used to determine the origin of groundwater in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) in the study of Wu et al. (2017). Both precipitation and its isotope composition vary seasonally, so arithmetic averages of precipitation isotope values poorly represent the isotope composition of meteoric water. Their finding that the BJD groundwater is recharged by modern meteoric water from local areas including the southeastern adjacent mountains was based on arithmetic averaging. However, this conclusion is not supported by the corrected mean precipitation isotope values, which are weighted by the precipitation rate. Indeed, the available isotopic evidence shows that modern precipitation on the Qilian Mountains is more likely to be the main source of the groundwater and lake water in the BJD, as found by Chen et al. (2004).

Factors Affecting Nesting Times in the Painted Turtle Chrysemys picta in Nebraska	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Although general descriptions of nesting in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) are numerous, few studies have quantified the timing of the components of the nesting process, and no previous study has analyzed the factors influencing those times. The present study was conducted on the Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Garden County, Nebraska, in June 2012 and 2013 and focused on a single nesting population of female C. picta. We recorded times for the initiation of the nest foray, and the beginning and conclusion of nesting, and calculated search and construction times. Although highly variable, on average females left the marsh at 1709 hrs (n = 130), began nesting at 1745 hrs (n = 141), and finished nesting at 1915 hrs (n = 135). Search time averaged 26 min (n = 79) and nest construction time averaged 97 min (n = 104). We investigated the effects of female body size, air temperature, time of day, nest day, clutch number, substrate type, and reproductive output on these times. Smaller females nested earlier in the day, construction times were shorter in warmer temperatures, nests begun earlier in the day were completed more quickly, and nest times were longer earlier in the season and for first vs. second clutches. Soil type and measures of reproductive output had no effects on nesting times. These results suggest that temperature is a primary driver of nesting times, as these turtles exploit the afternoon-evening window of optimal temperatures, avoiding heat stress earlier in the afternoon and much colder evening temperatures as well as a presumed increase in predation risk after dark.																			1071-8443	1943-3956				JUN	2017	16	1					44	51		10.2744/CCB-1208.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-1208.1													WOS:000403334200006

Long-term variations in the net inflow record for Lake Malawi	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Lake Malawi is the third largest lake in Africa and plays an important role in water supply, hydropower generation, agriculture and fisheries in the region. Lake level observations started in the 1890s and anecdotal evidence of variations dates back to the early 1800s. A chronology of lake level and outflow variations is presented together with updated estimates for the net inflow to the lake. The inflow series and selected rainfall records were also analysed using an unobserved component approach and, although there was little evidence of long-term trends, there was some indication of increasing interannual variability in recent decades. A weak quasi-periodic behaviour was also noted with a period of approximately 4-8 years. The results provide useful insights into the severity of drought and flood events in the region since the 1890s and the potential for seasonal forecasting of lake levels and outflows.

Incorporation of wastes by native species during and after an experimental aquaculture operation	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater aquaculture increases dissolved and particulate nutrients near fish cages, but the degree to which they are incorporated into tissues of native animals is uncertain. At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a cage culture of Rainbow Trout was operated seasonally for 5 y, and invertebrates and fishes were collected before, during, and after culturing from the experimental lake and a reference lake to assess changes in stable isotopes of C and N in their tissues. The feed contained marine fishmeal and was higher in C and N isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) than lake biota by >= 4 parts per thousand (all taxa) and 3 parts per thousand (all invertebrates), respectively. During the aquaculture operation, delta N-15 of littoral and pelagic invertebrates, profundal chironomids, minnows, and Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) increased by 2 to 5 parts per thousand relative to before aquaculture values. In the 1(st) and 2(nd) years after aquaculture, delta N-15 of several invertebrate taxa and all fishes continued to increase 1 to 2 parts per thousand/y. In contrast, during aquaculture, only minnows and trout had significant increases (up to 3 parts per thousand) in delta C-13. In the period after aquaculture, the delta C-13 of fishes, plankton, and profundal chironomids declined to below values measured before or during aquaculture. Isotopic analysis of native biota can be used to monitor assimilation of cage culture wastes in freshwater ecosystems.

A particle-tracking technique for spatial and temporal interpolation of satellite images applied to Lake Superior chlorophyll measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ocean color satellite-derived estimates of water properties are generally discontinuous in spatial and temporal coverage due to cloud cover. We describe a novel method for providing an estimate of continuous distribution of a satellite-derived water property, chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. The method uses calculated wind-driven lake circulation from a hydrodynamic model to estimate the evolution of the chlorophyll concentration field between available imagery. This new technique considers hydrodynamic effects by integrating a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) and an Eulerian concentration remapping approach. The PCPM interpolation method uses computational tracer particles that move with the calculated lake currents to represent the chlorophyll field. The concentration associated with each particle is dynamically adjusted toward the satellite-derived chlorophyll field at times and locations where imagery is available and produces a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of the chlorophyll concentration field. One of the important characteristics revealed from the analysis is the seasonally-dependent and region-specific chlorophyll concentration, which is significantly controlled by seasonal hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Superior. Analysis suggests that without adding extra sampling cost, moving a few sampling locations from offshore water to sample the embayments and southern coasts can provide more accurate characterization of the spatial pattern of chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. Furthermore, we found that Lake Superior chlorophyll concentrations do not appear to have changed significantly over the past 12 years and likely only slightly or not at all over the last 50 years, which differs from that in the other upper Great Lakes.

J	Chan, F; Pace, ML; Howarth, RW; Marino, RM				Chan, F; Pace, ML; Howarth, RW; Marino, RM			Bloom formation in heterocystic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria: The dependence on colony size and zooplankton grazing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The success of filamentous nitrogen (N)-fixing cyanobacteria in productive, transiently N-limited freshwaters reflects, in large part, their ability to produce and sustain the activities of specialized N-fixing heterocyst cells. Heterocyst production is variable, and the responses of planktonic cyanobacterial blooms to N limitation differ markedly among systems. Temporal variations in cyanobacteria colony size may determine both heterocyst production and sensitivity to top-down control by zooplankton grazers. We promoted the development of cyanobacterial blooms through phosphorus additions and trophic manipulations in freshwater ponds, to test the role of colony size structure in regulating N-fixer bloom development. The in situ growth and heterocyst production of Anabaena spp. were strongly linked to variations in colonial filament size. Anabaena spp. initially recruited to the water column as short and poorly heterocysted filaments, exhibiting low (mean = 0.09 d(-1)) rates of population growth. The growth rate increased by more than fourfold (mean = 0.39 d(-1)) with the onset of colony elongation and heterocyst production, which resulted in rapid seasonal build-ups of cyanobacterial cells (>10(5) cells ml(-1)). Size-dependent growth was also important in determining the outcome of zooplankton-cyanobacteria interactions. In microcosm experiments, zooplankton consumers directly grazed on Anabaena spp. colonies, reduced the mean filament size, and reduced the efficiency with which heterocysts fixed nitrogen. These results suggest that colony size is a fundamental mechanism that link cellular physiological constraints to variations in trophic controls and the responses of aquatic systems to N limitation.

Movement patterns and habitat selection of invasive African sharptooth catfish	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Information on the movement behaviour and habitat use by non-native invasive African catfish Clarias gariepinus is crucial in understanding and possibly mitigating its potential impacts. The aim of this study was to examine catfish movement and habitat selection within an invaded impoundment in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Acoustic telemetry data for 10 tagged catfish were analyzed to identify spatial patterns in home ranges and seasonal changes in habitat associations. Long-distance movements were observed for most catfish from common central release point, whereas short-distance movements defined their home ranges and utilization distributions that were categorized as localized within single or multiple habitats. Habitat selection was non-random with most catfish utilizing the shallow river mouth and upper section of the reservoir that were dominated by a rocky substratum interspersed with submerged trees. These localities were likely to be preferred for spawning and/or feeding. Utilization of these habitats by catfish is likely to be associated with probable impact due to predation and interference competition for feeding and breeding grounds with other species. Although most catfish maintained their home ranges throughout the study, seasonal shifts in habitat use, which was reflected by the utilization of deep and silt-dominated habitats, were also observed for some catfish. Non-random habitat use and homing behaviour within single and multiple habitats by non-native sharptooth catfish suggests that its impact within the invaded habitats may be associated with particular habitats both at broad spatial and temporal scales. Protection of habitats from catfish invasion should be considered as a management option to conserve native biota.					; Booth, Anthony/C-9932-2012	Kadye, Wilbert/0000-0002-5273-8360; Booth, Anthony/0000-0002-5561-9260													0952-8369	1469-7998				JAN	2013	289	1					41	51		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2012.00960.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2012.00960.x													WOS:000313830900006

Nevertheless, in spite of the minor or extended contemporary surveys, the picture of the prehistoric drainage works in Kopais has remained ambiguous.

This study was conducted to determine the presence of surfactants and heavy metals in a natural lake's surface microlayer and in rainwater from seven locations in the Lake Chini area in Malaysia. Colorimetric analysis was used to determine the concentration of anionic surfactants as methylene blue active substances (MBAS) and cationic surfactants as disulphine blue active substances (DBAS). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentration of heavy metals such as Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cd, and Ni. The results indicated that the average concentrations of MBAS and DBAS in the lake's surface microlayer were higher in the dry season (0.27 +/- 0.06 and 0.22 +/- 0.02mol L1) than in the wet season (0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.19 +/- 0.02mol L1). The average concentrations of MBAS and DBAS in rainwater were 0.21 +/- 0.02mol L1 and 0.18 +/- 0.02mol L1, respectively. Surfactants in the lake's surface microlayer were found to be positively correlated with Pb, Cd, Zn (p < 0.01) and with Ni (p < 0.05).

In this paper, we explored the changes of inflow and outflow of Poyang Lake during 1956 - 2009 and its possible relations to the TGD. The results indicate that: 1) significant decreasing inflow and outflow of Poyang Lake was found recently and more outflow of Poyang Lake can be found in October during 2008 and 2009 than that of 1960s; 2) the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has changed the seasonal variations of Poyang Lake and Yangtze River forcing. The strongest influence of TGD on the lower Yangtze reaches occurred in October when the TGD impounds every year. The impounding of TGD caused more water to flow into the Yangtze River in the October of both 2007 and 2008.

J	Deil, U; Alvarez, M; Bauer, EM; Ramírez, C				Deil, Ulrich; Alvarez, Miguel; Bauer, Eva-Maria; Ramirez, Carlos			The vegetation of seasonal wetlands in extratropical and orotropical South America	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Until now, the vegetation of seasonal wetlands in South America has only been studied on local to regional scales. A synoptic view is lacking and the distribution of vegetation types remains unknown. Hence we attempt here to detect floristic patterns on the spatial dimension of the subcontinent and to identify the environmental factors behind them. All plot-related floristic data (phytosociological releves) available to us were collected and stored in a TURBOVEG-database. The study area included both extratropical South America (austral-temperate and subantarctic climatic zones) and the orotropical biome of the Andean Highlands, because the amphibic habitats in the two areas have some taxa in common. Tropical lowlands were more dissimilar and thus were excluded. In total we found 573 vegetation samples in 28 bibliographic sources, published between 1960 and 2008. To achieve a consistent nomenclature was a major problem, and the taxonomic treatment of a number of habitat specific taxa is obviously in need of improvement. Classification and ordination were performed with the total data set as well as just the diagnostic taxa. The floristic structure was analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and procrustes rotation techniques to compare species combinations at the species and genus levels. The interpretation of the results is limited by the substantial floristic and ecological heterogeneity of the data (varying plot size, plots including an inundation gradient etc.) and by the spatially uneven distribution of the data. The classification revealed a higher diversity of communities than expected: 11 clusters with precise species combinations, ecology and distribution emerged from the classification: A) Plagiobothryo-Acaenion platyacanthae and B) Pration repentis are distributed in Southern Patagonia in seasonal lagoons, respectively on inundated turfs. Moorland pools and inundated bog hollows in hard cushion mires of the Andean belt have a number of genera in common, but separate on the species level into C) Muhlenbergia fastigiata-Distichlis humilis-communities in the semi-desert highlands of NW Argentina, D) Gentiana sedifolia-Carex bonplandii and Gentiano-Oritrophion-communities in the Super-Paramo belt of Venezuela, E) the Lilaeopsion andinae in the altiplano extending from S Peru to NE Chile and NW Argentina, and F) Limosella-communities ranging from E Bolivia to Central Andean Peru. Lakeshores in the super-forest belt of the wet tropical Andes and in the mountainous parts of extratropical South America are colonized by the Crassuletalia peduncularis-venezuelensis (cluster G), the amphibic zone of lakes in the temperate climate of Chile and Argentina by Littorellion australis- and Senecioni zosteraefolii-Eleocharietalia-communities (cluster H). The vegetation of vernal pools in Mediterranean Chile has been poorly studied until now, but some communities are recorded from the transition zone to temperate Chile. They are grouped in Juncion planifolii (cluster I). Seasonal wetlands in flooded Pampa grassland of Argentina are characterized by the Ludwigia peploides-Luziola peruviana-communities (group J). Muddy river banks of River Parana are colonized by the Lindernio dubiae-Mecardonietum (cluster K). Strong spatial patterns emerge on the continental scale, not only from vicinismus effects of the matrix vegetation surrounding the small-scale seasonal wetlands, but also for the habitat specific flora and vegetation. The main differentiating environmental factors on large scales are macroclimatic conditions and the trophc level of the substrate. Water depth, inundation duration and germination conditions in the amphibic ecophase result in a local zonation pattern. An azonal character of seasonal wetlands becomes obvious on the super-specific taxonomic rank from genera, that speciated within this environment and evolved geographical vicarious species with similar niches (e.g. Isoetes, Limosella, Ranunculus, Hypsela, Oritrophium, Littorella, Lilaeopsis, Muhlenbeckia and Crassula).

J	Johansson, F; Brodin, T				Johansson, F; Brodin, T			Effects of fish predators and abiotic factors on dragonfly community structure	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We compared the community structure of odonates (Odonata) in 13 waters in northern Sweden, which differed with respect to fish presence and abiotic factors. Richness and abundance of odonates were estimated by collecting exuviae during the whole emergence season of 1999. Redundancy analysis revealed that fish presence influenced the community composition of the odonate larvae. While species richness per sample was not affected by the presence of fish, total abundance of odonates was higher in waters without fish. In waters with fish, Aeschna juncea and Leucorrhinia dubia showed lower abundances, whereas Erythromma najas and Cordulia aenea showed higher abundances. The abundances of Coenagrion hastulatum, Libellula quadrimaculata, and Leucorrhinia rubicunda did not differ between waters with and without fish. Of the six abiotic factors analyzed only water acidity was associated with odonate community structure.

J	Kainz, M; Arts, MT; Mazumder, A				Kainz, Martin; Arts, Michael T.; Mazumder, Asit			Essential versus potentially toxic dietary substances: A seasonal comparison of essential fatty acids and methyl mercury concentrations in the planktonic food web	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We investigated seasonal variability of essential fatty acids (EFA) and methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations in four size categories of planktonic organisms in two coastal lakes. MeHg concentrations increased significantly with increasing plankton size and were independent of plankton taxonomy. However, total EFA increased from seston to mesozooplankton, but decreased in the cladoceran-dominated macrozoo-plankton size-class. Analysis of EFA patterns revealed that linoleic, alpha-linolenic, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic acids increased with increasing zooplankton size, but docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the cladoceran-dominated macrozooplankton was generally lower than in seston. This consistent pattern demonstrates that cladocerans, although bioaccumulating MeHg, convey less DHA than similar-sized copepods to their consumers. It is thus evident that fish consuming cladocerans have restricted access to DHA, yet unrestricted dietary access to MeHg. Thus, the structure of planktonic food webs clearly affects the composition of EFA and regulates dietary supply of these essential nutrients, while MeHg bioaccumulates with increasing zooplankton size.

J	Cai, J; Hodoki, Y; Ushio, M; Nakano, S				Cai, Ji; Hodoki, Yoshikuni; Ushio, Masayuki; Nakano, Shin-ichi			Influence of potential grazers on picocyanobacterial abundance in Lake Biwa revealed with empirical dynamic modeling	INLAND WATERS												Picocyanobacteria in lakes generally occur as single cells (single-celled picocyanobacteria; SPcy) or colonies (colonial picocyanobacteria; CPcy), and the latter form has been considered an adaptation to grazing pressure. In addition to direct effects of grazing, grazers may also have important indirect effects on picocyanobacteria, such as those from nutrient regeneration and trophic cascades. Interactions between picocyanobacteria and their grazers in lakes can thus be complex and difficult to predict. To evaluate the influence of various grazers on SPcy and CPcy in Lake Biwa, Japan, we followed seasonal changes in their abundances and potential grazers at 2-week intervals over 2 years. The data collected were analyzed using empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), a model-free, nonlinear time-series method. We found that heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), rotifers (Keratella, Polyarthra, and Trichocerca), cladocerans, and copepods played important and differing roles in controlling the abundances of SPcy and CPcy. Notably, HNF had an apparent positive influence on SPcy abundance, despite being considered major consumers of SPcy. This result suggested that the enhancement of SPcy growth due to nutrient regeneration by HNF might exceed losses from mortality due to grazing by HNF. EDM also suggested that colony formation by picocyanobacteria may be unidirectional, with SPcy tending to form CPcy. Our findings show that the seasonal dynamics of SPcy and CPcy in Lake Biwa are influenced by a variety of grazers, which may play differing ecological roles in the aquatic food web.

The determination of 41 VOCs was performed with a Purge and Trap-Gas Chroniatography-Mass Spectrometry method. Samples were collected seasonally from 10 rivers, seven lakes, three gulfs and four wastewater treatment plants. In surface water samples, 15 VOCs were detected. In wastewater samples, occurrence of 31 VOCs was observed. The results suggest that not only agricultural and industrial activity within the Greek territory, but also transboundary pollution deriving from neighbouring countries consist important sources of VOCs in surface waters of Greece.

J	Damci, E; Çagatay, MN				Damci, Emre; Cagatay, M. Namik			An automated algorithm for dating annually laminated sediments using X-ray radiographic images, with applications to Lake Van (Turkey), Lake Nautajarvi (Finland) and Byfjorden (Sweden)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Annually laminated (varved) sediments in marine and lake basins are important archives for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions, especially with their property to provide a continuous chronology. In this study we introduce a new approach for counting laminae using both digital and analogue X-ray radiographic images. The requirement for the method is that the resolution of the image is higher than the minimum lamina thickness, so that the measurement interval should be at least one third of the minimum lamina thickness. In our method, 8-bit or 16-bit grey scale radiographic images are scaled to grey-scale values between 0 and 1, and every maximum and minimum peaks corresponding to seasonal lamination are defined along the sediment core. The algorithm counts laminae rather than varves, thus allowing control on estimation of more reliable age models. Detected peaks are summed cumulatively along the core length, using a step determined by the annual lamina number of the varve. Using the algorithm, we provide test examples from the varved sediments of the Lake Nautajarvi in Finland, Byfjorden in Sweden and Lake Van in eastern Turkey, and compare our results with previously dated levels in the cores. There are good agreements between the varve counting results of our study and the previous studies, except for the ages from the lower part of the Lake Van core corresponding to a time interval between ca. 7000 and 8000 BP, for which there is ca 1000 year difference between the two sets of results. This difference might be the result of under-counting of varves in the previous studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The seasonal variation (pre-, during, and post-monsoon) in Keenjhar Lake water quality was investigated during nine sampling rounds at ten locations. Water samples (n = 270) were analyzed for As, Cd, Cr(III), Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, Cr(VI) with a UV spectrophotometer, and water quality parameters (solids, oxygen, conductivity, and pH). Several elements exceeded WHO or Pakistan safe limits for unrestricted use including As (0.038 mg center dot L-1, 95th upper confidence limit), Cr(III) (0.15 mg center dot L-1), Cd (0.11 mg center dot L-1), Fe (0.42 mg center dot L-1), Ni (0.037 mg center dot L-1), and Pb (0.04 mg center dot L-1). Monsoon levels of chromium, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Pb were higher than other seasons, while As was highest during post-monsoon, and Ni was highest during pre and post-monsoon. There were significant spatial differences in metals concentrations in the lake. As, Cu, and Fe significantly declined in concentration with distance from the lake inlet. Using the lake as a source of drinking water presented unacceptable carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic hazards. This study suggests measures should be taken to limit discharge of pollution to the lake and future monitoring should consider seasonal monsoon effects on lake quality.					; Ullah, Md Asmat/GYU-9827-2022; Shaikh, Kaleemullah/HCI-0954-2022	Ullah, Asmat/0000-0001-8295-3603; Weidhaas, Jennifer/0000-0002-5431-6794; 													1080-7039	1549-7860				FEB 7	2021	27	2					431	450		10.1080/10807039.2020.1729090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2020.1729090		FEB 2020											WOS:000514988200001
J	Bouvy, M; Pagano, M; Troussellier, M				Bouvy, M; Pagano, M; Troussellier, M			Effects of a cyanobacterial bloom (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) on bacteria and zooplankton communities in Ingazeira reservoir (northeast Brazil)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Species composition and seasonal succession of some planktonic components were studied through monthly samplings during 2 yr (1997 and 1998) in Ingazeira reservoir, northeast Brazil. Linked to the severe drought in this region (1997 El Nino event) was the dominance of the toxic filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in the phytoplankton in 1998 (96 to 100% of total phytoplankton biomass), with small proportions of heterocytes (12% of filaments). A great part of the variability of the particulate organic carbon (R-2 = 83.9%) was explained by changes in the C. raciborskii carbon biomass. A more significant change in bacterial communities was observed in the post-bloom phase when biomass increased due to the appearance of larger size-classes of cell volume, This bacterial size structure may be the consequence of a strong pressure by bacterivores. Among the zooplanktonic groups, rotifers were numerically more abundant throughout the survey, but microcrustaceans, especially the copepods, contributed the highest proportion of the biomass. Despite the low edibility of C, raciborskii (large trichomes; mean of 97 mum, n = 204), zooplankton diversity increased during and after the bloom (March to December 1998). Our data suggest that rotifers and copepods were able to cut up and shorten the filaments to edible size for other zooplankton species, especially the small-bodied herbivorous cladocerans, Thus, in the studied ecosystem, the heterotrophic micro-organism community appeared to be able to develop a strategy to cope with a dominant and relatively inedible algal food source.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				SEP 28	2001	25	3					215	227		10.3354/ame025215	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame025215													WOS:000171854800002

Polymerase chain reaction - denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the composition and heterogeneity of the bacterioplankton community. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to explore the relationships between DOC concentration and BCC. We found a significant negative correlation between DOC concentration and bacterioplankton community diversity (as measured by the Shannon-Wiener index (H')). The results show that spatial variation in the bacterioplankton population was stronger than the seasonal variation and that DOC concentration influences BCC in Lake Taihu. DOC concentration, followed by macrophyte biomass, water turbidity, and phytoplankton biomass were the most influential factors that account for BCC changes in Lake Taihu. More detailed studies on the relationship between DOC concentration and BCC should focus on differences in DOC concentrations and quality among these lake regions. DOC had a significant impact on BCC in Meiliang Bay. The relationship between DOC and BCC in the 2 other regions studied (Lake Center and Eastern Taihu) was weaker. The results of this study add to our understanding of the BCC in eutrophic lakes, especially regarding the role of the microbial loop in lake ecosystems.

Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Gyres in Oriented Lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Northern Alaska Based on Remotely Sensed Images	REMOTE SENSING												The formation of oriented thermokarst lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska has been the subject of debate for more than half a century. The striking elongation of the lakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction has led to the development of a preferred wind-generated gyre hypothesis, while other hypotheses include a combination of sun angle, topographic aspect, and/or antecedent conditions. A spatio-temporal analysis of oriented thermokarst lake gyres with recent (Landsat 8) and historical (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and ASTER) satellite imagery of the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska indicates that wind-generated gyres are both frequent and regionally extensive. Gyres are most common in lakes located near the Arctic coast after several days of sustained winds from a single direction, typically the northeast, and decrease in number landward with decreasing wind energy. This analysis indicates that the conditions necessary for the Carson and Hussey (1962) wind-generated gyre for oriented thermokarst lake formation are common temporally and regionally and correspond spatially with the geographic distribution of oriented lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Given an increase in the ice-free season for lakes as well as strengthening of the wind regime, the frequency and distribution of lake gyres may increase. This increase has implications for changes in northern high latitude aquatic ecosystems, particularly if wind-generated gyres promote permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake expansion.					; Beck, Richard/JIS-6286-2023; Zhan, Shengan/AAD-9821-2020	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Zhan, Shengan/0000-0002-9303-1249; 														2072-4292				OCT	2014	6	10					9170	9193		10.3390/rs6109170	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs6109170													WOS:000344458000002
J	Greisberger, S; Teubner, K				Greisberger, Sonja; Teubner, Katrin			Does pigment composition reflect phytoplankton community structure in differing temperature and light conditions in a deep alpine lake? An approach using HPLC and delayed fluorescence techniques	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												In vivo delayed fluorescence (DF) and HPLC/CHEMTAX pigment analyses were used to investigate seasonal and depth distributions of phytoplankton in a deep alpine mesotrophic lake, Mondsee (Austria). Using chl a equivalents, we determined significant relationships with both approaches. Community structure derived from pigment ratios of homogenous samples was compared with microscopic estimations using biovolume conversion factors. An advantage of the HPLC/CHEMTAX method was that it gave good discrimination among phytoplankton groups when based on a pigment ratio matrix derived from multiple regression analysis. When a single algal group was dominant, such as epilimnetic diatoms or hypolimnetic cyanobacteria in the deep chl maxima, HPLC/CHEMTAX results were significantly correlated with microscopic estimations (diatoms: r = 0.93; cyanobacteria: r = 0.94). Changes in the composition of photosynthetically active pigments were investigated with DF and benefited from excitation spectra that considered all light-harvesting pigments, which made it possible to assess the enhancement of accessory photosynthetically active pigments relative to active chl a (chl a(DF672)). Changes in similarity index, based on normalized DF spectra, confirmed compositional shifts observed by microscopy. At chosen wavelengths of DF spectra, 534 and 586 nm, we generally observed a significantly inverse relationship between normalized DF intensities and temperature and light along both seasonal and depth gradients. The relative increase in photosynthetically active pigments other than chl a(DF672) under low light and temperature was caused by an increasing dominance of diatoms and/or phycobilin-rich cyanobacteria and Cryptophyta. DF spectra provided a more accurate picture of community pigments acclimated to light and temperature conditions than the beta-carotene:chl a ratio derived from HPLC.

Vulnerability of Cambodian water snakes: Initial assessment of the impact of hunting at Tonle Sap Lake	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This paper documents the emergent snake 'fishery' occurring on Tonle Sap Lake where an estimated 6.9 million snakes (mostly homalopsids) are removed annually, representing the world's largest exploitation of a single snake assemblage. Based on inter-views with hunters, we found that snake catches declined by 74-84% between 2000 and 2005, raising strong concerns about the sustainability of this hunting operation. A combination of experimental trials to estimate population sizes and extensive catch and trade monitoring programs - indicated that population density varies both spatially and temporally, largely due to the seasonally fluctuating environment of Tonle Sap Lake. The quantity of snakes captured mirrors the lake's seasonal fluctuations, due to temporal changes in both catch per unit effort and the number of people hunting. Through inter-views with hunters we scored the seven exploited species for perceived changes in catch size. All species were reported as declining and their scores match their predicted vulnerability based on a combination of timing of exploitation relative to breeding, proportion of catch consisting of mature females and large fecund females, fecundity, body size, size at maturity, and vulnerability to capture by gill nets. This information can inform conservation decisions for the longterm preservation of this snake assemblage. We propose emphasis should be placed on the snake skin trade that is targeting the largest, highly fecund females, and that any efforts to reduce hunting should focus on the peak in trade that occurs during the main breeding season.

J	Wilder-Smith, A				Wilder-Smith, Annelies			Meningococcal vaccine in travelers	CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Purpose of review New vaccines to prevent meningococcal disease have been licensed in recent years. It is therefore timely to discuss current vaccine strategies pertinent to international travelers in relation to the changing epidemiology. Recent findings Serogroup W135 achieved epidemic status in Africa in 2002, and then largely disappeared over a short time period. The year 2006 saw a marked epidemic rise in meningitis attack rates across the meningitis belt in Africa. This rise was mainly due to a new serogroup A strain, indicating that a new meningitis epidemic wave is beginning in Africa. Epidemics are also spreading south of the meningitis belt, including the Greater Lakes Area (Burundi, Rwanda, Republic of Tanzania), The new quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine is now licensed in North America but not elsewhere. In most other industrialized countries, the serogroup C conjugate vaccine is licensed. Plain polysaccharide quadrivalent vaccines are available almost worldwide. Summary Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination is a visa requirement for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.

This recommendation should be extended to the Greater Lake Area, because of recent epidemics. Vaccine choices depend on availability.

Significant differences in the total lipid content were found between fish coming from the Rhine River and Lake Geneva (1.21 and 1.48%, respectively). Seasonal effects were investigated quarterly for perch sampled in the Rhine River. Intensively reared perch displayed a higher lipid content (1.48%) than the other farmed perch, i.e., 1.26% for a semiextensive system and 1.16% for an extensive system. No significant difference in lipid content was found (i) between lacustrine fish and intensively reared fish or (ii) among fish from the Rhine River and the semiextensive or extensive rearing systems. The main FA were 22:6n-3 (DHA, 21.3-37.1% of total FA), 16:0 (117.7-20.2%), 20:5n-3 (EPA, 9.2-13.2%), 18:1 (8.0-11.5%), 20:4n-6 [arachiclonic acid (ARA), 1.9-10.7%], 16:1 (4.3-6.0%), and 18:2n-6 (2.1-6.0%). In comparison with perch coming from the Rhine River, the lacustrine fish were characterized by higher total n-6 PUFA and a lower proportion of both total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and total n-3 PUFA, Among rearing systems, extensively farmed fish had higher n-6 PUFA and lower n-3 PUFA contents. Wild fish showed higher ARA and I 8:2n-6 than farmed fish. They also had significantly more EPA (12.5-13.2%) than farmed perch (9.2-10.9%). For DHA, no difference existed between (i) the lacustrine fish (31.9% of total FA) and the intensively reared fish (33.0%) and (ii) the Rhine (37.1%) and semiextensively reared fish (36%). Effects of size, diet composition, and environmental conditions on the total lipid contents and FA composition are discussed.																			0024-4201					MAR	2006	41	3					221	229		10.1007/s11745-006-5091-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-006-5091-9								16711596					WOS:000237334500002
J	Bichet, V; Gauthier, E; Massa, C; Perren, B; Richard, H; Petit, C; Mathieu, O				Bichet, Vincent; Gauthier, Emilie; Massa, Charly; Perren, Bianca; Richard, Herve; Petit, Christophe; Mathieu, Olivier			The history and impacts of farming activities in south Greenland: an insight from lake deposits	POLAR RECORD												Agriculture in southern Greenland has a two-phase history: with the Norse, who first settled and farmed the region between 985AD and circa 1450AD, and with the recent reintroduction of sheep farming (1920AD to the present). The agricultural sector in Greenland is expected to grow over the next century as anticipated climate warming extends the length of the growing season and increases productivity. This article presents a synthesis of results from a well-dated 1500-year lake sediment record from Lake Igaliku, south Greenland (61 degrees 00'N, 45 degrees 26'W, 15m asl) that demonstrates the relative impacts of modern and Norse agricultural activities. Pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), sediment mass accumulation rates, diatoms and stable isotopes of nitrogen provide a comprehensive history of both phases of agriculture and their associated impacts on the landscape and adjacent lake. The initial colonisation of southern Greenland is marked by a loss of tree birch pollen, a rise in weed taxa, and an increase in coprophilous fungi and sediment accumulation rate consistent with land-use changes. The biological and chemical proxies within the lake, however, show only slight changes in diatom taxa, and a rise in delta N-15. After the Norse demise and during the Little Ice Age, most of the markers return to pre-settlement conditions. However, the continuation of non-indigenous plant taxa suggests that the landscape did not completely return to a pre-disturbance state. After 1988, the character of the lake changed markedly: mesotrophic diatoms and N isotopes all reveal major shifts consistent with a trophic shift, together with a sharp rise in sediment accumulation rate. The post-1988 lake environment, affected by modern farming development, is unprecedented within the context of the last 1500 years. These results demonstrate the potential of lake sediment studies paired with archaeological investigations to reveal the relationship between climate, environment and human societies.

J	Kraemer, LD; Campbell, PGC; Hare, L				Kraemer, Lisa D.; Campbell, Peter G. C.; Hare, Landis			Seasonal variations in hepatic Cd and Cu concentrations and in the sub-cellular distribution of these metals in juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Temporal fluctuations in metal (Cd and Cu) concentrations were monitored over four months (May to August) in the liver of juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) sampled from four lakes situated along a metal concentration gradient in northwestern Quebec: Lake Opasatica (reference lake. low metal concentrations), Lake Vaudray (moderate metal concentrations) and lakes Osisko and Dufault (high metal levels). The objectives of this study were to determine if hepatic metal concentrations and metal-handling strategies at the sub-cellular level varied seasonally. Our results showed that Cd and Cu concentrations varied most, in both absolute and relative values, in fish with the highest hepatic metal concentrations. whereas fish sampled from the reference lake did not show any significant variation. To examine the sub-cellular partitioning of these two metals. we used a differential centrifugation technique that allowed the separation of cellular debris, metal detoxified fractions (heat-stable proteins such as metallothionein) and metal sensitive fractions (heat-denaturable proteins (HDP) and organelles). Whereas Cd concentrations in organelle and HDP fractions were maintained at low concentrations in perch from Lakes Opasatica and Vaudray, concentrations in these sensitive fractions were higher and more variable in perch from Lakes Dufault and Osisko, suggesting that there may be some liver dysfunction in these two fish Populations. Similarly, Cu concentrations in these sensitive fractions were higher and more variable in perch from the two most Cu-contaminated lakes (Dufault and Osisko) than in perch from the other two lakes, suggesting a breakdown of homeostatic control over this metal. These results suggest not only that metal concentrations vary seasonally, but also that concentrations vary most in fish from contaminated sites. Furthermore. at the sub-cellular level. homeostatic control of metal concentrations in metal-sensitive fractions is difficult to maintain in perch with high hepatic metal concentrations.

J	Behling, H				Behling, H			Late glacial and Holocene vegetation, climate and fire history inferred from Lagoa Nova in the southeastern Brazilian lowland	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The pollen and charcoal record of a 1,500-cm-long lake sediment core from Lagoa Nova allows a reconstruction of vegetation, climate and fire history in the Atlantic lowland of southeastern Brazil. Today the potential vegetation of the study region would be dense and tall semi-deciduous forest, related to a dry season of 4 months and 1,250 mm precipitation per year. The lowermost core section of Lagoa Nova is probably of late Glacial age and contains only few, poorly preserved pollen grains, indicating dry environmental conditions. Pollen preservation was good above 1,005-cm core depth. Extrapolating from four radiocarbon dates, this interval represents about the last 10,000 years. During the early Holocene (until about 8,500 B.P.), the landscape was dominated by savanna of the campo cerrado type (open shrub woodland), with frequent trees of Curatella americana and small areas of gallery forests along the drainage system. Savanna fires, probably natural, were frequent at that time. The palaeovegetation pattern is consistent with a long dry season of about 6 months and annual precipitation lower than today. Then, up to about 7,560 B.P., gallery forests expanded in the valleys, reflecting a shorter dry season of about 5 months and somewhat higher annual rainfall. Fire was less frequent during this wetter period. Between about 7,560 and 6,060 B.P., savanna expanded and gallery forests retreated, indicating a return to drier climatic conditions of probably between 5 and 6 months dry season and lower precipitation. Fire was again frequent, but not as frequent as during the early Holocene. During the mid to late Holocene period between about 6,060 and 2,180 B.P., the valleys were covered by semi-deciduous forest, but on the hills cerrado vegetation continued to grow. The dry season was probably around 5 months and rainfall was higher than in the preceding period. During the following period between about 2,810 and 600 B.P., the open cerrado on the hills changed to closed cerrado, reflecting wetter conditions with a shorter dry season than in the previous period. It was only after about 600 B.P. that dense semi-deciduous forests expanded throughout the study region, indicating the start of modern, wet climatic conditions with an annual dry season of about 4 months. Fire was nearly absent during this period. The reconstructed palaeoenvironment from the Lagoa Nova record is similar to that of Lago do Pires, indicating that changes in past vegetation, climate and fire frequency are regionally consistent in southeastern Brazil.																			0939-6314					DEC	2003	12	4					263	270		10.1007/s00334-003-0020-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-003-0020-9													WOS:000187158300006
J	Phlips, EJ; Badylak, S; Grosskopf, T				Phlips, EJ; Badylak, S; Grosskopf, T			Factors affecting the abundance of phytoplankton in a restricted subtropical lagoon, the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, USA	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Phytoplankton dynamics in the Indian River Lagoon was examined from the point of view of several key controlling factors, including: nutrient limitation, light availability, temperature, wind, hydrodynamic restriction and grazing. Water was collected at eight sampling sites in the lagoon on a monthly basis for a two and a half year period. Samples were analysed for nutrient content and phytoplankton abundance. Site measurements of salinity and light extinction were made at all sites. Regional data on rainfall, wind and water temperature was obtained for correlation analyses. Bioassays were performed to determine nutrient limiting status and a series of preliminary grazing experiments were carried out on selected samples. The results indicate that the Indian River Lagoon is a nutrient-rich environment where phytoplankton standing crops are often held below their potential by several key loss functions, including hydraulic flushing and grazing. Spatial patterns of phytoplankton abundance generally reflected the degree of restriction to water turnover in different regions of the lagoon, with higher mean abundances in restricted regions. Spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient content and limitation suggest that patterns of external nutrient loading also play a significant role in phytoplankton dynamics. High phosphorus levels in the southern portion of the lagoon contribute to the predominance of nitrogen limitation in the region. In contrast, relatively high N/P ratios in the northern portions of the lagoon contribute to greater potential for phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth. As might be expected from the subtropical location of the lagoon, temporal patterns of phytoplankton abundance appear to be less strictly dependent on season than in temperate habitats, and more closely linked to variations in weather conditions, like rainfall (including storm events). The latter considerations bring into play issues like temporal variation in salinity and wind-induced mixing. The high light flux and shallow depth in the lagoon also presents the potential for photoinhibition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Metabolic Phenotype of Daphnia Under Hypoxia: Macroevolution, Microevolution, and Phenotypic Plasticity	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Daphnia is a freshwater crustacean that is able to upregulate hemoglobin (Hb) in response to hypoxia, imparting a red color. We combine multiple field surveys across season with a lab experiment to evaluate changes in the metabolic phenotype of Daphnia in relation to environmental hypoxia. Looking at the zooplankton community, we found that D. pulicaria was restricted to lakes with a hypoxic hypolimnion. Comparing D. pulicaria with different amounts of Hb, red animals showed higher mRNA levels for several Hb genes, whereas most glycolytic genes showed red/pale differences of less than 50%. We also observed seasonal changes in the metabolic phenotype that differed between red and pale animals. Hb was upregulated early in the season in hypoxic lakes, and a relationship between Hb and lactate dehydrogenase only emerged later in the season in a temporal pattern that was lake specific. To evaluate whether these differences were due to specific lake environments or microevolutionary differences, we tested the induction of genes under controlled hypoxia in isofemale lines from each of four lakes. We found a strong response to 18 h hypoxia exposure in both Hb and lactate dehydrogenase mRNA, although the magnitude of the acute response was greater than the steady state differences in mRNA levels between pale and red Daphnia. The baseline expression of Hb and lactate dehydrogenase also varied between isofemale lines with different lake origins. These results, in combination with comparison of glycogen measurements, suggests that Hb functions primarily to facilitate oxygen delivery, mitigating systemic hypoxia, rather than an oxygen store. The combination of lab and field studies suggest that the metabolic phenotype of the animal is influenced by both microevolutionary differences (within and between lakes) as well as the spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity of the lakes. The differences between Daphnia species, and the unexpected lack of hypoxia sensitivity of select glycolytic genes provide evidence of macroevolutionary differences in metabolic strategies to cope with hypoxia.

J	VanCuren, RA				VanCuren, RA			Asian aerosols in North America: Extracting the chemical composition and mass concentration of the Asian continental aerosol plume from long-term aerosol records in the western United States - art. no. 4623	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Empirical assessment of the frequency and intensity of dust transport from Asia to North America has found that the dust regularly impacts elevated sites in the western United States, revealing a pattern of consistent, frequent transport above the marine boundary layer. Using the dust as a marker for Asian transport, a subset of Asian-influenced samples was identified within a decade of routine aerosol samples from two sites in the western cordillera of North America: Crater Lake, Oregon, and Mount Lassen, California. This subset was used to guide a statistical analysis to isolate Asian aerosol against the "background'' of local contaminants. The analysis was then generalized to all samples during the transport season ( March - October) for 1989 - 1999. A mixture of dust and combustion products dominates the Asian aerosol with typical concentration around 5 mug/m(3) and mass median diameter between 2 and 3 mum. Major fine particle (< 2.5 mu m diameter) constituent fractions are similar to 30% mineral, 28% organic compounds, 4% elemental carbon, 10% sulfate, < 5% nitrate, and < 1% sea salt. A second, possibly Asian, component of aged biomass smoke and sea salt is also present, with typical concentration ( when present) around 1.5 mu g/m(3). Averaged over the transport season the dusty Asian aerosol and the smoky aerosol comprise 60 and 6%, respectively, of total particle mass (< 10 mm diameter) and 72 and 13% of fine particle mass at these sites. These data indicate that the Asian continental plume is a significant contributor to aerosol loading at remote high-altitude sites across western North America. This implies a significant influence for Asian emissions on free troposphere aerosols over North America and suggests that they need to be explicitly accounted for in aerosol analyses ranging from climate studies to aerosol regulatory programs.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 17	2003	108	D20							4623	10.1029/2003JD003459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JD003459													WOS:000186088200005

The isotopic signatures of increased bulk-element abundances in urban areas and industrial complexes may reflect the mixed contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources. Together with the predominant abundance of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at both boundaries, specific indices derived from their abundance may be indicative of mixed contributions from terrestrial plants, petroleum, and combustion deposited through various pathways (e.g., atmospheric deposition, outfall pipes, and surface runoff). Based on these properties, compound isotopic signatures (delta C-13(C27+C29+C31) , delta C-13(Fl ), delta 1(3)C(Pyr) , delta C-13(BaA +Chry) , delta C-13(IcdP) , delta C-13(BghiP) ,) for both land-use types may provide significant evidence of an increase in anthropogenic derived-OM loads (> 90 %) in Lake Shihwa. This approach suggests that total organic carbon-weighted source apportionments can provide useful quantitative estimates of OM loads within complex river systems.

Pro- and anti-apoptotic microRNAs are differentially regulated during estivation in Xenopus laevis	GENE												Xenopus ictevis, the African clawed frog, undergoes seasonal estivation to survive periods of drought when its lake-bed habitats dry up. The frog can lose similar to 30% of its total body water, leading to conditions of impaired blood flow and ischemia which risk cellular survival under these harsh conditions. MicroRNAs are short, noncoding, single-stranded RNAs 21-24 nt long that have been widely implicated in hypometabolic responses, and serve functions including apoptosis survival. The levels of three pro-apoptotic and four anti-apoptotic miRNAs were measured in liver and skeletal muscle of estivating X. laevis, and bioinformatic analysis was performed to verify potential mRNA targets of these miRNAs. Members of pro-apoptotic miRNAs miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-101 showed upregulation as a result of dehydration stress, while anti-apoptotic miRNAs miR-19b, miR-21, miR-92a, and miR-155 showed differential regulation between the two tissues.

At present, the lake stays relatively calm with neither bubbling, steaming nor gas smell at a pH of 3.2-3.4, though the lake did change color with steaming from the water surface in 1939 as the result of one of Zao's volcanic activities. In order to clarify the geothermal effect on Okama and the groundwater flow system below or around Okama, field observations were performed in 2019 and 2020. Groundwater inflow and outflow in Okama were separately evaluated by estimating the hydrological and chemical budgets of the lake, based on the hydrometeorology, water temperature and river inflow measured in the field. The average groundwater inflow and outflow were estimated at 0.012 m(3)/s and 0.039 m(3)/s during the non-rainfall periods of 2020, respectively. A surplus of groundwater outflow makes the lake level consistently decrease during non-rainfall periods or the completely ice-covered season. In the completely ice-covered periods, the water temperature consistently increased at 0-15 m above the lake bottom, which is probably due to thermal leakage from a hydrothermal reservoir below the lake bottom. The heat fluxes averaged over December 2019-April 2020 and December 2020-March 2021 were calculated at 2.5 and 2.9 W/m(2), respectively. A coupling between the estimated groundwater inflow and the calculated geothermal heat flux was used to evaluate the temperature of inflowing groundwater.					; Miura, Satoshi/GSN-5361-2022; Yamamoto, Mare/AAC-2926-2019	Chikita, Kazuhisa/0000-0002-2623-6180; Miura, Satoshi/0000-0003-1151-5862; 														2306-5338				FEB	2022	9	2							28	10.3390/hydrology9020028	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology9020028													WOS:000827792700001

Observational data were generated from a weather station located in the center of one of the most important appellations located in the SW part of the state. Climate change projections retrieved from a high spatiotemporal weather model using atmospheric conditions simulated for the end of the 21st Century. All the temperature variables considered demonstrated significant warming trends especially during the months of March, April and May. Temperature differences, increases in heat accumulation, and changes to potential frost events would necessitate new approaches to vineyard management. In fact, it is likely that vine budburst will occur earlier and early season frost develop as a new challenge. However, our study results are comparable with other viticulture regions of the world, with a warming trend of at least 3 to 5 degrees C in the months leading up to the growing season by the end of the 21st Century. Therefore, effective climate change adaptations will be important to the grape and wine industry in this region. Management strategies are needed to minimize climate risks while taking advantage of new opportunities related to improved climatic conditions for growing more late-ripening European Vitis vinifera grape varieties, relevant for producing higher quality wines.

The key role of the water outflow dynamics in seasonal and interannual changes in concentrations of biogenic elements and organic carbon in the river and their inflow to the bay is confirmed. The spatial distribution of biogenic element concentrations in the bay depends on seasonal hydrological and geophysical conditions and on the activity of phytoplankton development. It is shown that under low-water conditions in the bay, the concentration of mineral compounds of biogenic elements decreased and that of organic compounds increased. In terms of total phosphorus, the Barguzin Bay is mainly characterized as a mesotrophic water body.

During the study period, the value of heat content increased in the upper water layer (45-100 m) only in May (12.4 (MJ/m(2))/year). In the water layers deeper than 100 m, the value of heat content decreased: -3--4 (MJ/m(2))/year from July to September in a layer of 100-300 m, -9--13 (MJ/m(2))/year in all months in a layer of 300-1100 m and -1.5--3 (MJ/m(2))/year in all months, except for January in a layer of 1100 m-bottom. Despite the revealed trends of the change in the heat content, the annual heat circulation remained within the normal range and did not have any trends.

However, bacterial biofilm developed on reed surfaces have been studied only in still waters. In the present study, comparative examinations were performed on the planktonic and reed biofilm bacterial communities from two different riverine water bodies. Water and reed biofilm samples were taken at the beginning and end of the vegetation period from (a) a regulated side arm and (b) a separated oxbow of River Danube. Besides measuring physical and chemical environmental variables, planktonic bacterial cell numbers were detected by 4 ',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining method, and the bacterial communities were compared by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Our results demonstrated that the structure and composition of bacterial communities correlated with different environmental variables and were different regarding both the habitats (planktonic vs. reed biofilm) and the types of riverine water bodies. The seasonal differences in the bacterial community structures were smaller in the river side arm than in the separated oxbow. In the water column, representatives of widespread and typical freshwater planktonic bacteria ("Candidatus Planktophila," Limnohabitans, and Polynucleobacter), whereas, in the reed biofilm samples, phototrophic and plant associated bacteria were identified.

Gear- and Season-Specific Catch Rates of Age-0 Walleyes and White Bass: Standard Sampling Recommendations for Great Plains Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Walleye Sander vitreus and White Bass Morone chrysops are two of the most popular sport fish species sought by anglers in the Great Plains. However, not all sampling approaches effectively capture age-0 Walleyes and White Bass, and therefore it may be difficult for fisheries managers to index age-0 year-class strength. We evaluated the differences among three gears for sampling age-0 Walleyes and White Bass: bag seining, boat electrofishing, and small-mesh gill netting. Boat electrofishing had the highest average catch, lowest minimum sample size needed to obtain a relative standard error of 25%, low operational effort, and the lowest mortality. The average catches of age-0 Walleyes and White Bass were positively correlated, suggesting that the two species can be sampled simultaneously. Considering all of the metrics evaluated, we recommend boat electrofishing in September as the most appropriate way to sample age-0 Walleyes and White Bass in reservoirs.

Reservoirs that are built to store freshwater resources and access water on demand, may be prone to get more environmental effects than natural resources. Phytoplankton, which is the first level of in primary production, is specifically affected by environmental changes in different ways. This study investigated the algal flora of Suloglu Reservoir (Edirne, Turkey) which is utilized as a freshwater reserve, as well as environmental variables influential on its community structure. For this reason a sampling campaign was performed in three stations selected in the reservoir in 3 different depths between January 2013 and November 2013. The study found 111 phytoplanktonic algae taxa belong to the divisions of Chlorophyta, Bacillariphyta, Cyanobacteria, Euglenophyta, Charophyta Miozoa and Ochrophyta. Chlorophyta members were generally dominant, and some environmental factors (i.e. light, pH values, temperature) were significantly effective on the distribution of all algal communities. The Shannon diversity values changed in the range of 1.02-2.75. CCA analysis results showed that there was a noticeable relationship between water quality parameters (chlorophyll-a, pH and water temperature) and time-based changes in dominant phytoplankton species. Moreover, recommendations were provided for sustainable usage of the reservoir whose trophic level was determined.

Abundance and patterns of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in Arctic floodplain lakes of the Mackenzie River Delta	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Mackenzie River Delta is a lake-rich arctic floodplain that receives high inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and suspended particulates from allochthonous and autochthonous sources, and may transfer carbon from dissolved to particulate phase via in situ formation of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). TEP provides food for grazers, surfaces for bacteria, and increased potential for aggregation and sedimentation of organic matter. During open water 2006, we tracked TEP abundances in three Delta lakes representing gradients that include declining river-to-lake connection times, increasing levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and declining chromophoric-DOM (CDOM). Unexpectedly, TEP abundances were highest immediately after the flood, when autochthonous autotrophic production was at a seasonal low and CDOM a seasonal high. Moreover, the lake with the strongest riverine influence and lowest levels of autochthonous autotrophic production had the highest mean TEP-carbon (TEP-C) concentrations among the lakes. The mean proportion of particulate organic carbon (POC) represented by TEP-C increased with increasing river connection time, and appears to represent a substantial proportion of POC in Mackenzie Delta Lakes. Unexpectedly, the TEP gradient was most strongly related to CDOM (river water source) rather than overall DOC. Variations in CDOM accounted for 53% of TEP-C variation among the lakes, indicating allochthonous matter was the most important source of TEP. DOC release from in situ macrophytes during periods of high photosynthesis may contribute to TEP formation in the lake with lowest riverine influence, but pH levels >9.5 driven by the high photosynthetic rates complicate the interpretation of results from this lake.

J	Hobbie, SE; Chapin, FS				Hobbie, SE; Chapin, FS			Response of tundra plant biomass, aboveground production, nitrogen, and CO2 flux to experimental warming	ECOLOGY												We manipulated air temperature in tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, and determined the consequences for total plant biomass; aboveground net primary production (ANPP), ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools and N uptake, and ecosystem CO, flux. After 3.5 growing seasons, in situ plastic greenhouses that raised air temperature during the growing season had little effect on total biomass, N content, or growing-season N uptake of the major plant and soil pools. Similarly, vascular ANPP and net ecosystem CO, exchange did not change with warming, although net primary production of mosses decreased with warming. Such general lack of response supports the hypothesis that productivity in tundra is constrained by the indirect effects of cold temperatures (e.g., low nutrient availability or short growing-season length) rather than by cold growing-season temperatures per se. Despite no effect on net ecosystem CO, flux, air warming stimulated early-season gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) throughout the growing season. This increased carbon turnover was probably associated with species-level responses to increased air temperature. Warming increased the aboveground biomass of the overstory shrub, dwarf birch (Betula nana), and caused a significant net redistribution of N from the understory evergreen shrub, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, to B. nana, despite no effects on soil temperature, total plant N, or N availability. Thus, although air warming had no effect on total ecosystem N pools, it did mediate N distribution within the plant community. The early-season stimulation of GP is consistent with warming effects on leaf expansion of dominant shrubs (including B. nana) observed in other studies in tussock tundra. The stimulation of ER probably resulted from maintenance and growth respiration associated with higher aboveground B, nana biomass production and higher root N uptake and/or turnover in the greenhouses. The species responses to warming are consistent with changes in plant species assemblages associated with past warming and suggest that future warming may increase the abundance of B. nana in tussock tundra. We conclude that a 4 degrees C rise in air temperature alone will significantly stimulate carbon turnover in tundra but will have little effect on net carbon balance.					; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; 													0012-9658					JUL	1998	79	5					1526	1544																WOS:000074853000005

Lakes El Sol and La Luna are very close to each other inside the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, but they differ morphometrically and limnologically. This study aimed to identify the seasonal fluctuation of the phytoplankton communities of these two tropical HMLs. El Sol phytoplankton comprised 50 taxa (chlorophytes, diatoms, charophytes) and La Luna 28 taxa (diatoms, euglenoids). The abundance of phytoplankton in El Sol was three times higher than in La Luna, and the biomass in El Sol was five times higher than in La Luna. Tropical seasonality was reflected differently in each lake. In El Sol, the highest phytoplankton abundance occurred in the rainy season, while the highest biomass was recorded in the dry/warm season. Conversely, in La Luna, abundance and biomass were more prominent in the dry/cold season. The study found that no meteorological or limnological factors could explain the seasonal dynamics of the taxonomic richness, abundance, or biomass of the phytoplankton communities in both lakes. The differences between the lakes are likely due to the more extreme conditions of La Luna, such as lower pH, ultra-oligotrophy, and increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Additionally, the introduction of rainbow trout into El Sol in the 1950s may have also contributed to the differences.					; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; Vilaclara, Gloria/0000-0003-4923-891X; Fernandez, Rocio/0000-0002-5826-0804; 													2223-7747					NOV	2024	13	21							3021	10.3390/plants13213021	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants13213021								39519940					WOS:001351733600001

During these sampling campaigns, 24 parameters were measured, including 20 trace elements. Results showed that measured levels of trace elements increased in the following order: Cd < Be < Tl < Co < Sb < Mo < Cu < Zn < Ni < V < Rb < Mn < As < Cr < Pb < Li < Ba < Se < Pd < Sr in the lake water and that these recorded values were lower than those recommended by the Moroccan standard and the World Health Organization, except for Pb and Se. Correlation analysis revealed two principal water-contamination sources: natural geological origins and anthropogenic inputs. In addition, the Water Quality Index WQI showed that the lake's water quality is poor, and its use can be dangerous for human and animal health. Health risk assessment associated with prolonged exposure to trace elements in lake water revealed that the Hazard quotient HQ and Hazard index HI of certain elements, such as Tl, Sb, V, As, Cr, Pb, Li, and Se, are higher than 1 in adult and children, indicating a significant risk for people living near the lake. Children are particularly vulnerable, with higher levels of HQ and HI, and selenium poses a substantial risk to their health through ingestion and skin absorption. In both adults and children, the total risk of cancer due to metals is classified as follows: CI (Cr) > CI (Ni) > CI (As) > CI (Pb) > CI (Cd). The Cr presents the highest carcinogenic risk-by ingestion or dermal route-in both groups. The total risk for these five metals exceeds 1 x 10(-4), indicating a danger for residents who drink or swim in the lake.					; moubchir, tarik/HTL-6340-2023; Shahat, Abdelaaty/C-4100-2011	Lim, Adrian/0000-0002-4638-9395; moubchir, tarik/0000-0002-6754-9618; Shahat, Abdelaaty/0000-0003-0456-3196; MSSILLOU, Ibrahim/0000-0002-8846-6299; 														2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	22							3231	10.3390/w16223231	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16223231													WOS:001367256300001

Here, the daily surface area of Poyang Lake is estimated using Landsat image data and water-level measurements. Multiple regression models are then used to establish the relationship between the surface area and the predictor variables of inflow into the lake, Yangtze River water level, and cumulative sand mining. The contributions of each driving factor to the reduction of Poyang Lake's surface area are quantified by scenario comparison method. The results reveal that the mean annual surface area of Poyang Lake decreased by 388 km2 (approximately 15% of the total surface area), from 2,585 km2 in 1980-2002 to 2,197 km2 in 2003-2016. In terms of overall contribution, sand mining is identified as the most important factor in the surface area reduction, followed by the shift in the Yangtze River stage-discharge relationship and the TGR flow rate regulation. In terms of monthly scale impacts, sand mining reduced the surface area by more than 260 km2 each month. The shift in the Yangtze River stage-discharge relationship reduced the surface area by 16-156 km2 during the dry season (November-May) of the Yangtze River and increased the surface area by 33-84 km2 during the flood season (June-October). The TGR flow rate regulation has the opposite effects: it reduced the surface area by 109-172 km2 during the impoundment period from September to October and increased it by 19-68 km2 during the release period from December to June.																			0733-9496	1943-5452				NOV 1	2024	150	11							05024011	10.1061/JWRMD5.WRENG-6356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JWRMD5.WRENG-6356													WOS:001313864500008

Variation in Color and Color Change in Island and Mainland Boas (Boa constrictor)	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Physiological color change and geographic variation in coloration are well documented in several squamate lineages, having presumably evolved for cryptic, sexual signaling, and thermoregulatory functions. Only 11 snake species have demonstrated physiological color change, although anecdotal reports suggest it may be present in additional species. We describe color variation and physiological color change in island and mainland populations of Boa constrictor using full-spectrum reflectance spectrometry. We employed principal components analysis (PCA) summarizing the spectrometry data into two axes that describe the brightness (PC1) and chroma or relative intensity of particular wavelengths (PC2). Boas from island and mainland localities exhibited physiological color change, and this change occurred on a diel cycle. Boas from both locations were lighter at night and darker during the day. The magnitude of the color change differed between our two PC axes. Although change in brightness was similar for boas on the islands and the mainland, the change in chroma was greater in boas from the mainland. Color also varied seasonally; boas were lighter in color and reflected more long-wavelength light during the wet season than during the dry season in Belize. We suggest that a fundamental hormone cycle (melatonin/melanophore stimulating hormone, MSH) present in a wide variety of vertebrates, underlies the physiological color change in snakes. If this is true, color change may be more widespread than previously realized, and the perceptual bias of the human vision system may have caused researchers to discount its presence in snakes.

Along such pathways, sediment transport by wind can surmount topographic obstacles and cross major drainages. Recent studies have suggested that three distinct eolian sand transport pathways exist (or once existed) in the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States. One hypothesized pathway is eolian sand transport from the eastern Mojave Desert of California into western Arizona, near Parker, and would require sand movement across what must have been at least a seasonally dry Colorado River valley. We tested this hypothesis by mineralogical, geochemical and magnetic analyses of eolian sands on both sides of the Colorado River, as well as sediment from the river itself. Results indicate that dunes on opposite sides of the Colorado River are mineralogically distinct: eastern California dunes are feldspar-rich whereas western Arizona dunes are quartz-rich, derived from quartz-rich Colorado River sediments. Because of historic vegetation changes, little new sediment from the Colorado River is presently available to supply the Parker dunes. Based on this study and previous work, the Colorado River is now known to be the source of sand for at least three of the major dune fields of the Sonoran Desert of western Arizona and northern Mexico. On the other hand, locally derived alluvium appears to be a more important source of dune fields in the Mojave Desert of California. Although many geomorphologists have stressed the importance of large fluvial systems in the origin of desert dune fields, few empirical data actually exist to support this theory. The results presented here demonstrate that a major river system in the southwestern United States is a barrier to the migration of some dune fields, but essential to the origin of others.

J	Matsuoka, M				Matsuoka, M			Microgelivation versus macrogelivation: Towards bridging the gap between laboratory and field frost weathering	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												The application of laboratory criteria for frost weathering to field problems needs caution, because a number of discrepancies lie between the laboratory and field conditions. This paper reviews thresholds for microgelivation of soft, intact rocks and macrogelivation of hard, jointed rocks, aiming at proposing better criteria in accordance with field conditions. The temperature at which ice segregation induces microgelivation varies significantly with lithology, ranging from about -1 degreesC in high porosity rocks to below -4 degreesC in low porosity rocks. Microgelivation can occur in initially unsaturated rocks when slow (seasonal) freezing drives prolonged water migration from surrounding rock or an external moisture source, while the occurrence requires a high degree of saturation (>80%) or a nearby moisture source when a rock undergoes rapid (diurnal) freezing. Rocks with a high internal surface area and low tensile strength favour microgelivation. These criteria are invalid for macrogelivation that tends to take place just below 0 degreesC in water-filled joints. In addition, because the depth reached by cracking varies with the type of freeze-thaw action, the analysis of thermal regimes should be based on data at the depth of actual cracking. Future targets for macrogelivation studies include the formation of new cracks in hard; intact rocks, as indicated by in situ shattering of clasts or bedrock typically observed in optimal moisture environments.

Although great efforts have been made to quantify LGD-derived CH4 fluxes and their spatial variablity, the underlying mechanisms controlling seasonal LGD-derived CH4 fluxes and their influence on lake CH4 emissions remain poorly understood, particularly in humid inland areas. To address this gap, we applied the 222Rn mass balance model, as well as hydrological, isotopic and microbial methods to assess seasonal LGD-derived CH4 fluxes and their influence on the seasonal variability of lake methane emissions in a typical oxbow lake, central Yangtze River. The results revealed wide seasonal differences in LGD-derived CH4 fluxes, which were controlled by hydrological and biogeochemical processes. During the dry season, although more intense methane oxidation and weaker methanogenesis occurred in groundwater, the much higher LGD rate (51.71 mm/d) produced a higher LGD-derived CH4 flux (16.41 mmol/m2/d). During the wet season, methanogenesis was more active and methane oxidation was weaker, but a lower LGD rate (12.16 mm/d) led to a lower LGD-derived CH4 flux (5.33 mmol/m2/d). Furthermore, higher LGD-derived CH4 flux in the dry season resulted in higher CH4 emissions from the lake and diminished the extent of methane oxidation in the lake. In comparison to other regions, the differences in LGDderived CH4 fluxes and their seasonal variations were found to be controlled by climatic conditions and lake types in different global regions. Higher LGD-derived CH4 fluxes and more pronounced seasonal variations could be associated with higher temperature, larger water depth and more intense water level fluctuations. This study provides a novel perspective and broader implications for the comprehension and evaluation of seasonal methane emissions and understanding the carbon cycle in global lake ecosystems in humid areas with intense water level fluctuations.

Environmental records needed to understand these dynamics are currently lacking from the Horn of Africa. Here we provide a new paleoenvironmental record based of new faunal data from archeological sites along the Bulbula River (Ziway-Shala Basin, Main Ethiopian Rift) in Ethiopia. Research conducted in this area has uncovered archeological assemblages that document various phases of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. Two sites dated to the terminal Pleistocene are considered here, B1s1 and B1s4. The former includes a very large assemblage of more than 20,000 skeletal remains. Both faunal assemblages are dominated by bovids of the tribes Alcelaphini and Antilopini and include Damaliscus hypsodon, a small extinct alcelaphine. The faunal remains from these sites, like those from the contemporary site of Lukenya Hill in south-central Kenya, are indicative of widespread arid grasslands. Several ungulates are found outside of their historic ranges, including Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) and Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas). Their absence from the region today likely reflects a combination of paleoenvironmental change since the end of the Pleistocene coupled with more recent human impacts.

Our aim was to summarize, list and provide a full inventory of benthic aquatic flora recorded in these transitional water systems. The 60 taxa found belonged to five phyla, viz., Rhodophyta, Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, Streptophyta and Magnoliophyta. There were 56 taxa in Greek lagoons and 16 in Cypriot water bodies. Many macroalgal species recorded in these environments form attached and unattached assemblages and play integral roles in the quality status of transitional water systems. The rare charophytes (Streptophyta) Chara tenuispina and C. hispida f. corfuensis are newly recorded for the Greek study area. In Cyprus, we found four species of charophytes (Chara aspera, C. canescens, C. vulgaris and Lamprothamnium papulosum) and two species of spermatophytes (Magnoliophyta): Althenia filiformis and Potamogeton pectinatus, which are new records for the island. Najas marina ssp. armata, P. pussilus, and Zannichelia pallustris ssp. pedicellata are new records for the study areas on Cyprus.					; PAPASTERGIADOU, EVA/J-8455-2012	Tziortzis, Iakovos/0000-0002-9315-7773; Papastergiadou, Eva/0000-0003-4430-878X													0006-8055	1437-4323				APR	2011	54	2					169	178		10.1515/BOT.2011.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/BOT.2011.016													WOS:000289343800006

In this article a historical perspective is adopted to explore the challenges and multiple insecurities of Pashtun and Uzbek pastoral communities who seasonally engage in long-distance migration from the lowlands in Northern Afghanistan to the high pastures of Badakhshan. The same pasture area is regularly utilised by Shughni mountain farmers who practise combined mountain agriculture in the high mountain settlements close to Lake Shewa. Debates about nomadism's place in transforming societies, the drama of the commons, human security, and vulnerability issues frame the discussion of pastoralism in contested commons. Based on empirical evidence derived from open interviews with migrating pastoralists and sedentary groups on the Shewa plateau in Badakhshan, interpretations of pastoralism are presented, embedded in the context of contemporary Afghanistan. Pastoralism as a valuable survival and adaptive strategy is challenged by multiple environmental, social and political insecurities, by militancy and weak state authorities, and it unfolds in contested commons and along dangerous routes. The nexus of legal pluralism, tenure insecurity and changing control of space is identified as an important determining factor for the shape of mobile pastoralism in present-day Afghanistan.

De Roda			Confirmation of the presence of Trichobilharzia by examination of water samples and snails following reports of cases of cercarial dermatitis	PARASITOLOGY												In case of cercarial dermatitis after exposure to fresh water lakes, managers responsible for bathing water quality wish to confirm the presence of Trichobilharzia, which substantiates taking measures to protect bathers from further exposure. A novel approach, including concentration of Suspected water samples by filtration and PCR detection of the parasite, is proposed. This approach has been applied to bathing sites with a history of cercarial dermatitis, sampled from 2005 to 2008. Examination of snails, the standard procedure for confirmation of the parasite's presence, and analysis of water samples, appear to be complementary procedures that enhance the chance of parasite detection in implicated bathing water. Water analysis is particularly valuable when snails cannot be found; it confirmed the presence of Trichobilharzia on 25% of sampling days with reported skin conditions and no snails found. PCR of the ToSau3A repeat directly confirmed the parasite in the water. The application of the combination of analysis of water samples and examination of snails is Suggested when cases of (presumptive) cercarial dermatitis are reported or when lakes with a history of cercarial dermatitis are inspected prior to the bathing season, in order to guide interventions to prevent (further) cases of swimmers' itch.																			0031-1820					JAN	2010	137	1					77	83		10.1017/S0031182009990849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182009990849								19691864					WOS:000274307100008

Calibration and confirmation of predicted water quality	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A coupled watershed-reservoir modeling system was applied to the Lake Waco reservoir and watershed to test possible sources of seasonal excess nutrient concentrations in Lake Waco. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for modeling watershed production of water and nutrients. This model included small lakes and dairies in the watershed, located spatially using geographic data. For the reservoir, the 2-dimensional, hydrodynamic model CE-Qual-W2 was used with inputs derived from the SWAT simulations. Calibration of the models was based on observed hydrographic information and stream and reservoir nutrient data. The relationship between predicted and observed stream flow values for the North Bosque River, the major tributary to the reservoir, were highly correlated (r2= 0.86) for the calibration period 1997-1998. Predicted daily nutrient values near the inflow of the North Bosque into Lake Waco reservoir were variable but similar to previously estimated annual loading values. Comparison of predicted water quality characteristics from the CE-Qual-W2 model with observed values showed acceptably reliable correspondence seasonally. Chlorophyll-a was used as the main measure for calibration accuracy due to its importance for reservoir management and was predicted to within 6.6% based on the mean percent error or an absolute root mean square error of 9.76 g/L of observed values. The prediction of stream values from the SWAT model and reservoir nutrient concentrations were sensitive and robust for the next phase of the Comprehensive Lake Waco Study, which includes evaluation of multiple watershed and reservoir management options.					; White, Joseph/AAF-9182-2021; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; Filstrup, Christopher/0000-0003-3812-2831; 													1040-2381						2010	26	2					147	158	PII 924740302	10.1080/07438141.2010.495315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.495315													WOS:000280285300009

Linking fish bioturbation to life history in a eutrophic wetland: An analysis of fish contributions to internal nutrient loading	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Bioturbation (sediment disturbance by animal actions) effects on nutrient cycling and nutrient levels in surface waters are difficult to quantify, in part because the diversity and magnitude of species-specific influences are poorly understood. These influences may have consequences for the management of the trophic state of freshwater ecosystems. Fish cause bioturbation in freshwater and marine ecosystems by digging in benthic sediments, manipulating periphyton mats while searching for prey and scraping hard substrates while feeding. We used experimental enclosures (2.25 m2) to quantify bioturbation-mediated phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) regeneration from sediment by three species of fish that differ in interactions with the benthos (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides; tilapia, Oreochromis spp.; and sailfin catfish, Pterogoplichthys spp.) in shallow eutrophic wetlands in Southern Florida. Tilapia are omnivores that include detritus in their diet (winnowing or ingesting sediments) and dig nests in soft sediments year round, sailfin catfish actively burrow into substrate and consume detritus (digging and ingesting sediments), and largemouth bass are piscivores that do not routinely interact with the benthos when feeding but may dig nests in soft sediment in spawning season (January-April). We quantified the amount of suspended flocculent organic matter and changes in water column nutrients (total phosphorus [TP] and total nitrogen [TN]) in 2-week trials for each species and estimated the portion of nutrient increases relative to fishless controls that could be attributed to bioturbation-mediated internal nutrient loading through suspension of organic matter (as opposed to excretion or other sources of nutrient loading). Water column nutrient concentrations increased with increasing biomass for all species, but the bioturbation contribution differed by species. Largemouth bass increased water column nutrient concentrations (TP: 86% and TN: 5% relative to controls) but did not influence water column suspended particulate matter through bioturbation of sediment. Tilapia increased water column nutrients a modest amount (TP: 8%; TN: 15%), of which a small portion was attributed to bioturbation (c. 18% of TP). Sailfin catfish raised water column nutrients substantially (TP: 105%; TN: 46%) and up to 100% of the increased TP was attributed to bioturbation. Sailfin catfish also suppressed algal growth and TP accumulation on the sides of the enclosures and reduced nutrient concentrations of the flocculent sediments. Our results were consistent with our hypothesis that behaviour and foraging traits affect bioturbation contributions to nutrient loading. The results also demonstrated that species with similar net effects like largemouth bass and sailfin catfish, added nutrients via different mechanisms (i.e. excretion vs. bioturbation). Considering the feeding strategies and interactions with the substrate of common fish species may assist managers in meeting nutrient reduction goals for eutrophic wetlands and managed freshwater systems.					; Trexler, Joel/I-5265-2012; Barton, Mark/V-7772-2019	Trexler, Joel/0000-0001-8105-4067; Dorn, Nathan/0000-0001-5516-0253; Cook, Mark/0009-0002-4206-7548													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2025	70	1								10.1111/fwb.14353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14353		OCT 2024											WOS:001342131600001

Energy density of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lakes Huron and Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We collected lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis off Alpena and Tawas City, Michigan, USA in Lake Huron and off Muskegon, Michigan USA in Lake Michigan during 2002-2004. We determined energy density and percent dry weight for lake whitefish from both lakes and lipid content for Lake Michigan fish. Energy density increased with increasing fish weight up to 800 g, and then remained relatively constant with further increases in fish weight. Energy density, adjusted for weight, was lower in Lake Huron than in Lake Michigan for both small (<= 800 g) and large fish (> 800 g). Energy density did not differ seasonally for small or large lake whitefish or between adult male and female fish. Energy density was strongly correlated with percent dry weight and percent lipid content. Based on data from commercially caught lake whitefish, body condition was lower in Lake Huron than Lake Michigan during 1981-2003, indicating that the dissimilarity in body condition between the lakes could be long standing. Energy density and lipid content in 2002-2004 in Lake Michigan were lower than data for comparable sized fish collected in 1969-1971. Differences in energy density between lakes were attributed to variation in diet and prey energy content as well as factors that affect feeding rates such as lake whitefish density and prey abundance.

J	Burns, DA				Burns, DA			The effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and southern Wyoming, USA - a critical review	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Rocky Mountains of Colorado and southern Wyoming receive atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition that ranges from 2 to 7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and some previous research indicates pronounced ecosystem effects at the highest rates of deposition. This paper provides a critical review of previously published studies on the effects of atmospheric N deposition in the region. Plant community changes have been demonstrated through N fertilization studies, however, N limitation is still widely reported in alpine tundra and subalpine forests of the Front Range, and sensitivity to changes in snow cover alone indicate the importance of climate sensitivity in these ecosystems. Retention of N in atmospheric wet deposition is < 50% in some watersheds east of the Continental Divide, which reflects low biomass and a short growing season relative to the timing and N load in deposition. Regional upward temporal trends in surface water NO3- concentrations have not been demonstrated, and future trend analyses must consider the role of climate as well as N deposition. Relatively high rates of atmospheric N deposition east of the Divide may have altered nutrient limitation of phytoplankton, species composition of diatoms, and amphibian populations, but most of these effects have been inconclusive to date, and additional studies are needed to confirm hypothesized cause and effect relations. Projected future population growth and energy use in Colorado and the west increase the likelihood that the subtle effects of atmospheric N deposition now evident in the Front Range will become more pronounced and widespread in the future.

Partitioning of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically available irradiance in a deep dendritic tropical lake	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												We studied the effects of particulate and dissolved optically active components on the attenuation of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) in a tropical lake. The temporal and spatial distribution of tripton, Chl-a and a CDOM (440) and their relative contribution to the diffuse PAR attenuation coefficient (Kd) was investigated at 21 sites (dry and wet seasons and two intermediate periods) and at monthly interval at 1 pelagic site. Higher values of Kd were observed during the mixing period, characterized by a higher concentration of tripton and Chl-a compared to the stratified rainy season. In the spatial sampling PAR attenuation was dominated by tripton absorption/scattering (average relative contribution of 79%), followed by Chl-a (average 11.6%). In the monthly sampling tripton and Chl-a accounted for most of the Kd with relative contributions of 47.8% and 35.6%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that Chl-a and tripton in combination explained 97% of the monthly variation in Kd (p< 0.001), but Chl-a had more influence (higher regression coefficient). Thus, although most of light attenuation was due to tripton, seasonal variations in phytoplankton abundance were responsible for most of the temporal fluctuations in Kd.

J	Nausch, M; Nausch, G				Nausch, Monika; Nausch, Guenther			Bioavailability of dissolved organic phosphorus in the Baltic Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We determined bioavailable, dissolved organic phosphorus (BAP) by measuring changes in dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in experiments using 0.8 mu m filtered seawater, representing the free bacteria fraction, with the addition of carbon and nitrogen. Experiments were conducted at 3 stations in the central Baltic Sea from May to July 2004, a period characterized by a decrease in phosphate concentrations, and the development of diazotrophic cyanobacteria blooms. DOP concentrations ranged between 0.32 and 0.52 mu M in May, and declined to 0.20 mu M in July, Changes in DOP were caused by fluctuations in the BAP decreasing from 0.34 mu M in May to 0.03 mu M in July. The refractory DOP pool ranged from 0.14 to 0.21 mu M, and did not vary seasonally, The DOP turnover and P release from BAP was calculated using 2 different approaches: (1) [gamma-P-33]ATP hydrolysis time, and (2) the time needed for DOP degradation in the experiments. Based on [y-P-33]ATP hydrolysis times, BAP is recycled several times per day, except at 2 stations in May when the time is longer. According to the second approach, BAP is recycled within 3 or 4 d without seasonal differences. The fast [gamma-P-33]ATP turnover indicates that BAP comprises a fraction of compounds (such as ATP) that are degraded very rapidly. Another pool of BAP compounds exists which are turned over at a slower rate. Thus, the [gamma-(33)p]ATP does not represent the total BAP turnover.																			0171-8630						2006	321						9	17		10.3354/meps321009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps321009													WOS:000241282700002

Can artificial plant beds be used to enhance macroinvertebrate food resources for perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) during the initial phase of lake restoration by cyprinid removal?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Restoration of shallow lakes to a clear-water state, often characterized by high submerged macrophyte cover and a high proportion of piscivores such as perch, Perca fluviatilis L., frequently involves removal of a large proportion of the zoobenthivorous fish, such as bream, Abramis brama L., and roach, Rutilus rutilus L. (i.e. biomanipulation). However, establishment of submerged macrophytes is often delayed following fish removal. This is unfortunate because plant beds typically host high densities of the macroinvertebrates constituting the diet of small perch and thus help perch to go through the bottleneck from feeding on macroinvertebrates to feeding on fish. Establishment of artificial plant beds may be a useful tool to enhance macroinvertebrate population growth and thus food resources for small perch until the natural plants have established. To investigate this restoration option, we studied during two growing seasons (June-October) the composition and abundance of the macroinvertebrate community in artificial plant beds installed in shallow Lake V'ng (Denmark) comprising the initial phase of a biomanipulation effort by fish removal. Lake areas with artificial plant beds exhibited substantially higher macroinvertebrate densities than the lake bottom. This suggests that artificial plant beds may be used as feeding grounds for small perch, similarly to the well-known refuge effect for zooplankton against fish predation. In this way, artificial plant beds could help maintain a clear-water state during the transient period when natural submerged vegetation is not yet established in the lake.

Population regulation of the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) in a reservoir: Implications for invasion	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We conducted a 3-yr study of the population dynamics of the invasive cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus in Island Lake Reservoir (Minnesota) and compared our results to other human-constructed reservoirs and natural lakes to examine ecological differences of B. longimanus between these ecosystem types and to investigate how reservoirs facilitate invasion of this zooplankter. The maximum and mean densities (n = number of individuals) of B. longimanus were larger in Island Lake Reservoir (> 100 n m(-3) and 20-57 n m(-3), respectively) and in most other reservoirs than in natural lakes. Island Lake Reservoir and most other reservoir populations also exhibited multiple (up to six) cycles of growth and collapse per season, and performed extensive diel vertical migrations (DVM) to near the lake bottom during the day. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the population dynamics of B. longimanus in Island Lake Reservoir were governed by relaxed top-down control by fish predation and strong bottom-up control by food availability. Developmental stage-specific death rates predicted from a matrix model were density dependent, aligned with predictions of bottom-up control (e. g., largest for the smallest instars, and correlated with food resources), and were inconsistent with anticipated prey demands by fishes. The reproductive and DVM trends of B. longimanus also indicated food stress and abated top-down control, respectively. We propose a mechanistic basis for invasion success in reservoirs by linking several limnological attributes, including chlorophyll a, water level fluctuation, light penetration, and thermal conditions to increased growth potential of B. longimanus.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2012	57	1					251	271		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0251	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0251													WOS:000302612100003

Design and testing of a novel hypolimnetic oxygenation system to improve water quality in Lake Bard, California. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:245-254. Hypolimnetic oxygenation, the engineered addition of oxygen gas to the bottom of lakes and reservoirs, can improve water quality by repressing the accumulation of nutrients, metals, and toxic compounds in bottom waters. This study designed and tested an oxygenation system in Lake Bard, California. Hypolimnetic oxygen demand, a key design parameter, was estimated through the combination of sediment-water chamber incubations and numerical analysis of water column dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles. Chamber incubations showed that increased water velocity near the sediment-water interface substantially increased the rate of sediment oxygen uptake, and this observation was incorporated into system sizing. The chamber study also confirmed that maintenance of oxygenated conditions repressed sediment release of phosphate, ammonia, manganese, and sulfide. Phosphorus and manganese release rates were 6-8 mg/m(2)/d and 2-5 mg/m(2)/d under anoxic conditions, respectively, but negligible or negative under oxic conditions. The novel hypolimnetic oxygenation system used a waste product, oxygen-rich off-gas from an ozone contactor at a nearby water treatment plant, to sustainably improve source water quality. The system was tested over a 2 week period in June 2004. Oxygen addition averaged 380 kg/d and increased bottom water DO from 1-2 to 5-6 mg/L with a concurrent drop in water column phosphate and iron, and a delay in sediment release of ammonia. Manganese, with its slow oxidation kinetics, remained in bottom waters during the oxygenation test, indicating that the oxygenation system needs to be turned on earlier in the season to better control manganese accumulation in bottom waters.																			0743-8141						2012	28	3					245	254		10.1080/07438141.2012.716501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.716501													WOS:000308981900008

Various absolute age measurements obtained during the last decade yield new age data to correlate with the dinosaur fossil-bearing Cretaceous deposits in Korea. The radiometric age of the lower (Sindong Group) and middle (Hayang Group) parts of the Gyeongsang Basin (the largest basin of the KCDC) located in the eastern part of the KCDC gives dates ranging from Aptian to Campanian, which is younger than the previous biostratigraphic age estimates, but the results may be influenced by metamorphism. Likewise, radiometric dates from the Cretaceous sequence in the western part of the KCDC give numerical values suggesting a correlation with the Upper Cretaceous Yucheon Group of the Gyeongsang Basin. Dinosaur evidence (e. g., tracks, eggs, bones) along the KCDC is variable in relation to stratigraphy and paleoenvironment. Dinosaur tracks are preserved mostly in stratigraphically higher Cretaceous lake margin deposits, whereas dinosaur bones occur mostly in older Cretaceous floodplain deposits. Most dinosaur eggs are found in Upper Cretaceous deposits, and they occur in floodplain deposits of alluvial fan and meandering river settings. Thus, we conclude that dinosaurs inhabited volcanically influenced, alluvial fan, fluvial plain, and lake margins on the Korean Peninsula throughout the Cretaceous under a semi-arid climate with strong seasonality. The rarer occurrence of dinosaur tracks in older Cretaceous deposits in some basins might be attributed to the limited exposures of lake-margin deposits.

Semipermanent GPS strategy	LATE CENOZOIC STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE GREAT BASIN-SIERRA NEVADA TRANSITION	Geological Society of America Special Papers											As of October 2005, the semipermanent Global Positioning System (GPS) network called MAGNET (Mobile Array of GPS for Nevada Transtension) included 60 stations and spanned 160 km (N-S) x 260 km (E-W) across the northern Walker Lane and central Nevada seismic belt. MAGNET was designed as a cheaper, higher-density alternative to permanent networks in order to deliver high-accuracy velocities more rapidly than campaigns. The mean nearest-neighbor spacing is 19 km (13-31 km range). At each site, the design facilitates equipment installation and pickup within minutes, with the antenna mounted precisely at the same location to mitigate eccentricity error and intersession multipath variation. Each site has been occupied similar to 50% of the time to sample seasonal signals. Using a custom regional filtering technique to process 1.5 yr of intermittent time series, the longest-running sites are assessed to have velocity accuracies of similar to 1 mm/yr. The mean weekly repeatability is 0.5 mm in longitude, 0.6 mm in latitude, and 2.1 mm in height. Within a few years, MAGNET will characterize strain partitioning in the northern Walker Lane to improve models of (1) geothermal activity, which is largely amagmatic in the Great Basin, (2) seismic hazard, (3) the ways in which northern Walker Lane accommodates strain between the Sierra Nevada block and the extending Basin and Range Province, and (4) Neogene development of the northern Walker Lane and its broader role in the ongoing evolution of the Pacific-North America plate-boundary system. MAGNET's design is generally applicable to regions with an abundance of vehicle-accessible rock outcrops and could be replicated elsewhere.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2447-8				2009	447						1	15		10.1130/2009.2447(01)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2447(01)													WOS:000271620800002
J	Czesny, SJ; Graeb, BDS; Dettmers, JM				Czesny, SJ; Graeb, BDS; Dettmers, JM			Ecological consequences of swim bladder noninflation for larval yellow perch	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Swim bladder inflation is a fundamental developmental step during the larval stage of many fishes. Although the physiological mechanisms of swim bladder inflation are well documented, the ecological costs of noninflation are poorly understood. If high proportions of newly hatched fish larvae fail to inflate their swim bladders and swim bladder noninflation negatively affects individual survival probability, the population-levet effects could be dramatic. To determine whether fish larvae without inflated swim bladders perform differently than their conspecifics with inflated swim bladders, we compared growth rate, feeding selectivity and efficiency, susceptibility to predation, oxygen consumption, and starvation mortality of two size-classes of larval yellow perch Perca flavescens With and without inflated swim bladders in a series of experiments. In the laboratory, growth rates of yellow perch with uninflated swim bladders were less than those for fish with inflated swim bladders, and fish with inflated swim bladders fed more efficiently than those with uninflated swim bladders. In addition, predation risk, metabolic demands, and vulnerability to starvation mortality were higher in fish lacking an inflated swim bladder than in fish with an inflated swim bladder. In the field, individuals with uninflated swim bladders were smaller than their conspecifics with inflated swim bladders. The relative occurrence of yellow perch larvae without inflated swim bladders declined as the sampling season progressed until only fish with inflated swim bladders were collected. Our results demonstrate that a larval yellow perch's failure to inflate its swim bladder results in a higher probability of dying. Thus, on the population scale, the factors affecting swim bladder inflation among larval fishes may have a profound effect on recruitment dynamics.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2005	134	4					1011	1020		10.1577/T04-016.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T04-016.1													WOS:000230411700020
J	Makino, W; Cotner, JB				Makino, W; Cotner, JB			Elemental stoichiometry of a heterotrophic bacterial community in a freshwater lake: implications for growth- and resource-dependent variations	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) suggests that growth and elemental stoichiometry of organisms are coupled through variation in nucleic acid composition, specifically variation in ribosomal RNA. We examined these interactions in a bacterial community (< 1 mum water) from the moderately productive Lake Owasso (Minnesota, USA). A mixed bacterial community was grown in chemostats with different supply carbon:phosphorus ratios (93, 373 and 933 by atoms) and dilution (=growth) rates (0.25, 0.5 and 0.7 h(-1)). We measured bacterial C, N, P, DNA and RNA content to determine resource- and growth-dependent variations in the elemental stoichiometry of bacterial biomass at the community level. In chemostats with high supply C:P ratios (greater than or equal to373), biomass P increased proportionally to growth rate as a result of increased RNA content. High growth rates generated low biomass C:P and N:P ratios. At a low supply C:P (93:1), biomass C:P and N:P increased with increasing growth rate, even though RNA content increased, suggesting that non-nucleic acid P (presumably polyphosphate) was the dominant P-pool in this community and may have been more important in altering biomass stoichiometry at increasing growth rates. Therefore, the coupling of stoichiometry to growth predicted by the growth rate hypothesis was applicable only under P-limited conditions. These chemostat results revealed more complicated responses of bacterial C:N:P stoichiometry at a community level than in individual strains. The Lake Owasso bacterial community was more homeostatic in terms of biomass C:P and N:P stoichiometry than other bacterial communities described in the literature, and the degree of homeostasis for the Lake Owasso bacterial community was similar to that of single bacterial strains. However, few similar measurements have been made, and the degree of biomass C:N:P homeostasis may vary between systems and even within a system during different seasons.

High diversity of freshwater invertebrates on inuinnait nuna, the canadian arctic, revealed using mitochondrial DNA barcodes	POLAR BIOLOGY												Knowledge of genetic and species-level diversity for freshwater invertebrates in the Canadian Arctic is currently limited. Here, we sampled benthic and planktonic invertebrates from 68 ponds, seven lakes, and six rivers near Cambridge Bay (Iqaluktuuttiaq), Nunavut, between 2018 and 2021 and analysed individuals using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequences. From the 9336 specimens collected, 7186 provided sequences > 400 base pairs (83% success rate), representing 3358 unique haplotypes and 467 putative species based on Barcode Index Numbers (BINs; as a surrogate for species-level diversity). Chironomidae (non-biting midges) was the most diverse taxon, followed by Trombidiformes mites and Anomopoda (water fleas). Species' accumulation curves for total diversity as well as the major taxa suggest that taxa we identified represent < 63% of the total diversity likely to be found in this region of the western Canadian Arctic (estimated n = 739) during the ice-free season. Further sampling over a wider geographical range as well as assessments of temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability will be required to assess comprehensively the total species richness currently found in the Canadian Arctic. In the interim, the publicly available data we provide here can be used as a baseline for ongoing studies and to track ecological changes occurring in aquatic habitats of the central Canadian Arctic and beyond.

Water-levelfluctuating zone (WLFZ) of lakes serves as vital transitional areas between land and water, exhibiting crucial ecological functions. However, the relationship between soil moisture-sensitive bacterial communities and ecosystem multifunctionality remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a two-year seasonal field survey in the WLFZ of one large flooding lake. By using amplicon sequencing, we explored the changing characteristics of soil bacterial communities during water level fluctuations and their driving role in ecosystem multifunctionality. A simultaneous decrease in soil bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality was observed as the soil transitioned from drought to flooding states. Soil bacterial diversity was positively correlated with ecosystem multifunctionality, and rare bacterial sub-communities showed a higher correlation with multifunctionality than the overall bacterial community. Random forest regression analysis demonstrated that rare bacterial sub-communities were the optimal predictor variable for ecosystem multifunctionality in the WLFZ. Additionally, Actinobacteriota and Methylomirabilota held significance in predicting multifunctionality under drought and flooding states, respectively. This study highlighted the predominant role of soil rare bacterial subcommunities in driving ecosystem functionality in the WLFZ.

Here, we developed a process-based one-dimensional model (Snow, Ice, WAater, and Sediment: SIWAS) to simulate a full year's surface energy fluxes and thermal dynamics for a moderately large (>500 km(2)) boreal hydroelectric reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. There is a lack of climate and weather data for most of the Canadian boreal so we designed SIWAS with a minimum of inputs and with a daily time step. The modeled surface energy fluxes were consistent with six years of observations from eddy covariance measurements taken in the middle of the reservoir. The simulated water temperature profiles agreed well with observations from over 100 sites across the reservoir. The model successfully captured the observed annual trend of ice cover timing, although the model overestimated the length of ice cover period (15 days). Sensitivity analysis revealed that air temperature significantly affects the ice cover duration, water and sediment temperatures, but that dissolved organic carbon concentrations have little effect on the heat fluxes, and water and sediment temperatures. We conclude that the SIWAS model is capable of simulating surface energy fluxes and thermal dynamics for boreal reservoirs in regions where high temporal resolution climate data are not available. SIWAS is suitable for integration into biogeochemical models for simulating a reservoir's carbon cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zolá, RP; Bengtsson, L				Zolá, RP; Bengtsson, L			Long-term and extreme water level variations of the shallow Lake Poopo, Bolivia	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Lake Poopo, within the large Altiplano basin of Bolivia, is connected upstream to Lake Titicaca and downstream to the salares, the big salt fields. Small changes in precipitation and river inflows strongly affect the extent of the lake surface area. For times when there are no satellite images, it is difficult to determine the extent of the lake from observations. Water balance computations were performed to create a water-level series for Lake Poopo extending back in time. The dominant water inflow to Lake Poopo is from the River Desaguadero, which constitutes the outflow of Lake Titicaca. The water-balance computations confirm the crude peasant knowledge about historical lake status. It is found that if the lake level is less than I in during the wet season, there is a risk that this shallow lake dries out in the dry season.

This eutrophication model, which includes very dense submerged plants, was calibrated using a standard procedure described by Jorgensen and Bendoriccho [Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling, 3rd ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 20 pp.]. Furthermore, exergy was applied as a goal function to consider the dynamic adaptation and the seasonality of plankton species (e.g. size shifts). This study provides the second case example by applying the exergy as a goal function in the calibration phase. The model was also validated using the data of another year. The results were consistent with the validations of the several lake models [Hydrobiologia 356 (1997a) 87; Hydrobiologia 379 (1998) 147; Hydrobiologia 445 (2001b) 1]. The model gives a fairly good performance in describing the competition between phytoplankton and submerged plants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Water from fifteen selected sites of the lake and River Mingoa, Cameroon was sampled in August 16th of 2005 and 2006 and in 30th August 2007 during the minor dry season; and subjected to the analyses of physicochemical parameters and various elements. In addition, multivariate data analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized to determine the variations in heavy metal content in the Municipal Lake water and their natural or anthropogenic sources. The chemical results indicated that concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, Cd and Pb in the study area exceeded the drinking water quality and they would pose health risk for users of these waters. This is evidence that River Mingoa, the main tributary to the Municipal Lake is the main collector of pollutants from activities in the sloping side of the Municipal Lake. Based on the multivariate statistical analysis, very high positive correlations were observed between elements, and five factors computed from PCA explained 86.6% of total variance. These factor loadings are mainly controlled by anthropogenic inputs, lithogenic processes during weathering progress of natural parent materials and local geology.

Modeling the implications of multiple hatching sites for larval dynamics in the resurgent Saginaw Bay walleye population	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The early life environment experienced by most larval fish is largely dependent on a combination of hatch site and water currents. Until larvae are able to swim fast enough to overcome currents, they are largely passively transported and have limited control over ambient environmental conditions, including temperature and prey availability. These factors strongly influence growth and survival of larvae, with direct consequences for subsequent recruitment. Early life survival of Saginaw Bay walleye was formerly limited by alewife predation on larvae; but following the collapse of Lake Huron alewives, the walleye population has rebounded and recruitment success may now be influenced by other factors including spawning habitat. We sought to assess the implications of successful hatching at multiple locations in Saginaw Bay, using a hydrodynamics model, particle transport model, and an individual-based bioenergetics model in series. Model results were compared to locations of young larvae collected in Saginaw Bay during 2009-2010. Results suggest that larval growth is strongly influenced by hatch date, driven by seasonal variation in temperature between sites. Larvae hatched at any location could be transported extensively within inner Saginaw Bay before reaching a sufficient size to swim independently of currents, and retention within the productive inner bay varied among years and sites. Our results indicate multiple larval walleye origins in the field, augmenting the continued production from the Saginaw River system. Successful hatching at more locations would serve to buffer walleye recruitment variation through portfolio effects, supporting arguments for more emphasis on diverse spawning habitat management and restoration.

Cylindrospermopsis in lake erie:: Testing its association with other cyanobacterial genera and major linmological parameters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We report the first documented observation of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis in Lake Erie and Sandusky Bay in 2005 (0.043-1.326 mg L-1 wet weight, 16-1,942 trichomes mL(-1)) and quantify the physical and chemical parameters and the cyanobacterial community composition contemporaneous to its occurrence. We hypothesize that the high temperature, low light intensity, and high nutrient content of Sandusky Bay, a shallow, drowned river mouth along the southwestern shore of Lake Erie, provides an ideal habitat for Cylindrospermopsis. This is consistent with published laboratory and field studies that show these physical and chemical conditions facilitate Cylindrospermopsis growth. Using multivariate statistics, we found that Cylindrospermopsis biomass correlated with high temperatures and shallow depths, conditions often found in Sandusky Bay. Light climate and nutrient concentrations were not associated with Cylindrospermopsis biomass, most likely because the light climate did not systematically change during the season and because nutrients exceeded demand. We propose that Cylindrospermopsis will increase in importance in Lake Erie, as previous research on climate change in the Great Lakes region predicts future higher water temperatures and lower water levels.

J	Tyler, JJ; Leng, MJ; Arrowsmith, C				Tyler, Jonathan J.; Leng, Melanie J.; Arrowsmith, Carol			Seasonality and the isotope hydrology of Lochnagar, a Scottish mountain lake: implications for palaeoclimate research	HOLOCENE												The relationship between isotope ratios in precipitation and lake waters was monitored by bi-weekly measurements taken over a five and a half year period between May 2000 and September 2005 (a period of 1964 days) at Lochnagar, a remote mountain lake in eastern Scotland. Short-term changes in the oxygen isotope composition of lake water (delta O-18(L)) at Lochnagar follow a seasonal pattern similar to isotopes in local precipitation (delta O-18(P)), however changes in catchment residence time, snow accumulation, lake ice cover and lake stratification modify the temporal structure of delta O-18(L) over the seasonal cycle. Of particular importance is precipitation amount, which controls catchment and lake residence times, and determines the degree of phase lag and amplitude change between delta O-18(L) and delta O-18(P). A simple mass balance model replicates these effects and demonstrates that the degree of phase lag and amplitude reduction is predictable given known input/volume ratio. The implications of these observations for the use of delta O-18 records in palaeoclimatology Are important, since it is rare that authigenic and biogenic minerals or organic compounds (from which delta O-18 and/or delta H-2 can be measured) are produced in a lake evenly throughout the year.

The objective of this study was to gain more knowledge about macrophyte assemblages in reservoirs in Slovakia, where it was necessary to start analyses leading to the ecological assessment. The research was carried out in 14 multipurpose reservoirs during the vegetation seasons 2008-2010. Analyses focused on the determination of species composition considering the similarity between reservoirs, the impact of selected environmental variables on species composition and evaluation of the Macrophyte Biological Index for Lakes (IBML) in relation to its use for ecological assessment. In total, 60 taxa of macrophytes were identified. More than 90% of all determined taxa are indicators of IBML. The statistical analysis performed was based on the study of macrophyte assemblages and environmental variables and gave the following results: i) based on species composition, two main clusters of reservoirs were identified respecting altitude (reservoirs at an altitude above and less than 300 m a.s.l.) and affiliation to phytogeographical ecoregion (reservoirs in Pannonian lowland and Carpathians); ii) water temperature, followed by dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand, were found to be the main environmental variables influencing the composition of macrophyte assemblages using DCA analysis. Water temperature and phosphates were determined to be the variables responsible for species composition using CCA analysis; iii) differences of the mean IBML values between clusters corresponded with the results of cluster analysis. A significant correlation was found between IBML and two variables: conductivity and alkalinity. Based on the results, it is recommended to use the IBML for analyses leading to the assessment of ecological potential based on biological quality elements.

Divergent populations have adapted to thrive in the prevailing oligotrophic environments and thus have developed morphotypes with different ecological behaviors. The morphotypes usually differ in size, morphology, coloration, feeding ecology, and/or habitat occupancy. Although morphotypes that have very divergent spawning seasons should become genetically segregated, genetic differentiation, in most cases, has been weak. Thus, results to date have suggested that Arctic Char morphotype separation has been driven largely by the environmentally mediated phenotypic plasticity of the species, with differentiation between morphotypes having commenced too recently to generate substantial genetic drift. Here we used the major histocompatibility (MH) class II genes in an attempt to isolate sympatric Arctic Char morphotypes known to be ecologically differentiated. These morphotypes are from postglacial lakes in both Siberia and eastern Canada, and differ in either diet, habitat occupancy, or both. The MH Class II allelic polymorphism was significantly different between morphotypes. This suggested there is differential heritable adaptation to the natural selection exerted by pathogens unique to each ecological niche within each lake.

Phytoplankton and water samples were collected seasonally from 9 points and 7 depths between the surface and 20 m from December 2004 to September 2005. Planktolyngbya contorta was the dominant or subdominant species in all seasons and depths. The dominance of Gomphonema species was observed in December, but they were subdominant in September. Cyclotella meneghiniana was dominant at 20 m and subdominant in the upper depths during March, June, and September. Melosira sp. and Meridion circulare were the dominant taxa of the surface phytoplankton in March and June, respectively. A nonparametric test showed the prevalence of cyanobacteria and green algae at a depth of 10 m. Principal component analysis showed the effect of temperature, pH, dissolved solids, nitrate, and silica on the abundance and distribution of phytoplankton. The generalized linear model revealed that high pH and high dissolved solids content seemed to affect the abundance of phytoplankton via limiting nutrient availability.

Seasonal Effects in a Lake Sediment Archaeal Community of the Brazilian Savanna	ARCHAEA-AN INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The Cerrado is a biome that corresponds to 24% of Brazil's territory. Only recently microbial communities of this biome have been investigated. Here we describe for the first time the diversity of archaeal communities from freshwater lake sediments of the Cerrado in the dry season and in the transition period between the dry and rainy seasons, when the first rains occur. Gene libraries were constructed, using Archaea-specific primers for the 16S rRNA and amoA genes. Analysis revealed marked differences between the archaeal communities found in the two seasons. I.1a and I.1c Thaumarchaeota were found in greater numbers in the transition period, while MCG Archaea was dominant on the dry season. Methanogens were only found in the dry season. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences revealed lower diversity on the transition period. We detected archaeal amoA sequences in both seasons, but there were more OTUs during the dry season. These sequences were within the same cluster as Nitrosotalea devanaterra's amoA gene. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) test revealed significant differences between samples from different seasons. These results provide information on archaeal diversity in freshwater lake sediments of the Cerrado and indicates that rain is likely a factor that impacts these communities.

An implantable instrument for studying the long-term flight biology of migratory birds	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS												The design of an instrument deployed in a project studying the high altitude Himalayan migrations of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) is described. The electronics of this archival datalogger measured 22 x 14 x 6.5 mm, weighed 3 g, was powered by a 1/2AA-sized battery weighing 10 g and housed in a transparent biocompatible tube sealed with titanium electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG). The combined weight of 32 g represented less than 2% of the typical bodyweight of the geese. The primary tasks of the instrument were to continuously record a digitised ECG signal for heart-rate determination and store 12-bit triaxial accelerations sampled at 100 Hz with 15% coverage over each 2 min period. Measurement of atmospheric pressure provided an indication of altitude and rate of ascent or descent during flight. Geomagnetic field readings allowed for latitude estimation. These parameters were logged twice per minute along with body temperature. Data were stored to a memory card of 8 GB capacity. Instruments were implanted in geese captured on Mongolian lakes during the breeding season when the birds are temporarily flightless due to moulting. The goal was to collect data over a ten month period, covering both southward and northward migrations. This imposed extreme constraints on the design's power consumption. Raw ECG can be post-processed to obtain heart-rate, allowing improved rejection of signal interference due to strenuous activity of locomotory muscles during flight. Accelerometry can be used to monitor wing-beat frequency and body kinematics, and since the geese continued to flap their wings continuously even during rather steep descents, act as a proxy for biomechanical power. The instrument enables detailed investigation of the challenges faced by the geese during these arduous migrations which typically involve flying at extreme altitudes through cold, low density air where oxygen availability is significantly reduced compared to sea level.

The present and upcoming climates of Transdanubia seem to be suitable for the main vector of Chikungunya virus, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus Skuse (syn. Stegomyia albopicta). West Nile fever is recently endemic in Hungary. We used climate envelope modeling to predict the recent and future potential distribution/occurrence areas of the vector and the disease. We found that climate can be sufficient to explain the recently observed area of A. albopictus, while in the case of West Nile fever, the migration routes of reservoir birds, the run of the floodplains, and the position of lakes are also important determinants of the observed occurrence.					; Bede-Fazekas, Ákos/J-1636-2012; Trájer, Attila J/GVS-3713-2022	Trajer, Attila/0000-0003-3248-6474; 													0324-6329					JAN-MAR	2014	118	1					19	40																WOS:000333517500002

Effects of oxygen and nitrate on nutrient release from profundal sediments of a large, oligo-mesotrophic reservoir, Lake Mathews, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Mathews is a large, oligo-mesotrophic reservoir located in Southern California. The reservoir has elevated levels of nitrate and periodically experiences hypolimnetic anoxia. Experimental sediment-water chamber incubations and reservoir water quality monitoring were conducted to evaluate how oxygen and nitrate in overlaying water affect nutrient release from profundal sediments and internal nutrient loading. In experimental incubations, under nitrate-free anoxic conditions, sediment nutrient release rates were 3.4 +/- 0.8 mg-P/m(2).d for phosphate and 2.8 +/- 1.2 mg-N/m(2).d for ammonia (average +/- standard deviation; n = 6). Oxygen repressed phosphate release and greatly diminished ammonia release from sediments in experimental incubations while nitrate only repressed phosphate release. Similar nutrient release dynamics were observed in the reservoir. Nutrient release rates estimated from seasonal nutrient profiles collected from the reservoir were 3.4 mg-P/m(2).d for phosphate and 2.5 mg-N/m(2).d for ammonia. Ammonia accumulation in the hypolimnion commenced with the onset of anoxic conditions, but phosphate accumulation did not start until nitrate disappeared from bottom waters approximately 6 weeks later. The time lag decreased total internal phosphorus loading by approximately 25% relative to hypothetical nitrate-free conditions. Laboratory and field data show that both oxygen and nitrate repress sediment phosphate release, likely via the maintenance of an oxidized surficial sediment layer that retains phosphate in iron-oxide complexes. However, only oxygen and not nitrate was effective in decreasing sediment ammonia release, likely by enhancing biological nitrification and assimilation in surficial sediments under oxic conditions. A number of in-lake management strategies have been developed to inhibit internal nutrient loading including calcium nitrate addition, aluminum sulfate addition, and oxygenation. In our view, the deliberate addition of nitrate to lakes and reservoirs poses several risks that must be carefully considered when evaluating strategies to control sediment phosphorus release.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	1					18	29		10.1080/07438140809354047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354047													WOS:000269665800003

Chemical-environment interactions affecting the risk of impacts on aquatic organisms: A review with a Canadian perspective - interactions affecting vulnerability	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.					; Macdonald, Robie/A-7896-2012	Catherine, Couillard/0000-0001-9323-6482; Macdonald, Robie/0000-0002-1141-8520													1208-6053	1181-8700					2008	16						19	44		10.1139/A07-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/A07-008													WOS:000262499700002

Direct and indirect (foodweb mediated) effects of metal exposure on the growth of yellow perch (Perca flavescens):: Implications for ecological risk assessment	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Yellow perch (YP) are metal tolerant fish that form large populations in many metal-impacted regions across Canada. While they are able to survive and reproduce successfully in environments with water and sediment metal concentrations that are toxic to many invertebrates, perch experience a suite of direct and indirect impacts. YP were studied in a series of Canadian Precambrian Shield lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, along a gradient of metal exposure downwind from metal smelters. In lakes at the high end of our exposure gradient, concentrations of metals (Cu, Ni, and Cd) in YP liver and kidney were well above levels seen in fish from reference lakes. Direct effects linked to metal-exposure were observed, ranging from effects at the cellular level, to effects in organs and tissues, individuals, and populations. In addition to direct or physiological effects, we also documented indirect, foodweb-mediated effects of metals on YP in the most contaminated lakes resulting from the elimination of metal-sensitive large benthic invertebrates and their replacement by small metal-tolerant taxa. The most common indication of such indirect effects on YP is severely stunted growth coupled with a high degree of zooplankton dependence throughout their life. Such indirect effects have important implications for ecological risk assessment (ERA) because they indicate that higher trophic levels may be functionally altered even though the functional groups that they depend on are present and abundant. Although the functional groups important to yellow perch can be abundant in metal-impacted lakes, their benthic communities are impoverished and this is strongly reflected in their size structure upon which energy transfer to higher trophic levels depends. Thus indirect (foodweb-mediated) effects can be important in situations where invertebrate size structure is impacted in such a way as to reduce the efficiency of energy transfer to higher trophic levels, and therefore measures should be taken to protect and/or restore large sensitive benthic species.

J	Villa-Martínez, R; Villagrán, C; Jenny, B				Villa-Martínez, R; Villagrán, C; Jenny, B			The last 7500 cal yr BP of westerly rainfall in Central Chile inferred from a high-resolution pollen record from Laguna Aculeo (34°S)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We report multiproxy analyses of a sediment core obtained from Laguna Aculeo that spans the past 7500 years. Laguna Aculeo (33degrees50'S, 70degrees55'W) is one of the few natural inland lakes located in the Mediterranean zone of Central Chile, near the northern margin of the influence of the southern westerlies. The record shows elevated pollen counts of halophytes and seasonally drying of the lake basin prior to 5700 cal yr B.P., indicating severe aridity and warmer-than-present conditions. This was followed by the establishment of a fresh-water lake, along with an increase in arboreal and herbaceous plant diversity between 5700 and 3200 cal yr B.P. An intensification of this trend starred at 3200 cal yr B.P., along with the abrupt decrease of halophytes until 100 cal yr B.P. Within this humid period, pollen accumulation rates show large-amplitude fluctuations, coeval with numerous turbidite layers, suggesting a highly variable and torrential rainfall pattern. This intense and variable precipitation regime is probably associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We suggest that the modern Mediterranean climate of Central Chile was established at similar to3200 cal yr B.P. Paleovegetation and paleolimnological changes starting at 100 cal yr B.P. correlate with documented human activity surrounding the lake. (C) 2003 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Yoshida, T; Urabe, J; Elser, JJ				Yoshida, T; Urabe, J; Elser, JJ			Assessment of 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' forces as determinants of rotifer distribution among lakes in Ontario, Canada	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Predation and food supply are generally perceived as important determinants of spatial and temporal variations of populations. The population dynamics of freshwater rotifers have been well researched in this aspect. However, their spatial variations have attracted less attention and have not been studied by simultaneously considering both predation and food supply. We studied spatial variations of rotifer abundance among 34 Canadian boreal lakes. A large part of the variance of rotifer abundance was associated with variables related to trophic status including chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. However, abundances of mesozooplankton such as potential predators and competitors did not correlate with rotifer abundance and did not explain the residual of the regression between rotifer abundance and chlorophyll a. The results of the present study indicated that variation in rotifer abundance among lakes was caused by 'bottom-up' forces related to food supply and not by 'top-down' predatory interactions. This provides a contrast to previous empiric and experimental studies that reported that temporal variations of rotifer abundance were mainly regulated by 'top-down' interactions. This discrepancy suggests that overall differences in rotifer abundance among lakes are mainly determined by 'bottom-up' forces while temporal changes in single lakes are shaped by 'top-down' forces. Meanwhile, the composition of rotifer species was correlated with mesozooplankton abundance as well as trophic status. Rotifer species with long spines or rigid loricae were found in the lakes where mesozooplankton were abundant, which suggests that defensive morphology could have affected the rotifer species distribution among the study lakes.

We found 15 living and 10 subfossil ostracods. Species with high tolerances (Eucypris virens) and/or with swimming abilities (Cypria ophtalmica) were reported from the canal and wetland. Non-swimmer ostracods (e.g., Prionocypris zenkeri) were only found from the creek. Ostracod Watch Model illustrated some species with stenochronal and eurychronal (e.g., Heterocypris incongruens) occurrences per site. CCA results displayed that water temperature and electrical conductivity were the most important explanatory variables on species. Unbiased diversity indices revealed the highest diversity in the canal followed by the creek, wetland, and trough. Wetland diversity exhibited positive and negative correlations with the canal and the creek, respectively. Tukey's pairwise test supported the significant comparisons between the trough, canal, and wetland (p < 0.01). The ratio of tolerant species per station was slightly higher in the canal than the wetland, trough, and creek. This suggests the fact that species encountered from the creek seem to be habitat specific and may be considered more vulnerable to changes in aquatic conditions. Frequency of species encountered in three habitats (wetland, canal, and trough) was significantly changed after the construction (digging and converting the wetland) activities began in August 2019. This activity was a negative impact on species diversity and richness in the wetland area where the diversity sharply dropped down and did not recover during the study. In contrast, this was probably advantage for some cosmoecious species.					; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018	Ataman, Alper/0000-0003-2175-0137; KULKOYLUOGLU, OKAN/0000-0003-4712-5612; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2022	56	3					605	618		10.1007/s10452-021-09934-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09934-6		JAN 2022						35018133					WOS:000739775700002

Mysid and fish zooplanktivory in Lake Ontario: quantification of direct and indirect effects	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Mysis relicta and planktivorous fish feed on zooplankton in Lake Ontario and form atrophic triangle that includes intraguild predation by fish on mysids. Thus, fish affect zooplankton both directly and indirectly. To evaluate the importance of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and mysids as zooplanktivores in Lake Ontario, we measured abundances and distributions, assessed diets, and computed mysid and fish consumption rates based on bioenergetics models. We further estimated indirect effects by comparing clearance rates given observed and potential mysid distributions. Estimated consumption rates varied widely with season and water depth and ranged between 2.6 x 10(-3) and 1.3 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) for mysids and between 1.4 x 10(-3) and 0.5 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) for fish, representing a daily removal of zooplankton of up to 10.2%center dot day(-1) and 2.0%center dot day(-1) by mysids and fish, respectively. Mysid planktivory exceeded fish planktivory in May and August, but fish planktivory dominated in October. Estimated mysid planktivory rates were 2- to 90-fold lower than the potential rate if mysids moved to temperatures that maximized their predation rates, suggesting an indirect positive effect of fish on zooplankton.																			0706-652X					DEC	2006	63	12					2734	2747		10.1139/F06-156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-156													WOS:000243945200012

Concentration, size distribution, and dry deposition rate of particle-associated metals in the Los Angeles region	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Daily averaged atmospheric concentrations and dry deposition fluxes of particulate metals were measured seasonally at six urban sites and one non-urban coastal site in the Los Angeles region using a conventional total suspended particulate matter (TSP) filter, surrogate surface deposition plates, and a Noll Rotary Impactor (NRI), which provides information about particle size distribution in four size ranges above 6 mu m. With the exception of the non-urban site, particulate metal concentrations and deposition fluxes were remarkably uniform spatially and temporally. At all sites there were significant metal concentrations on particles greater than 10 mu m, a commonly used upper limit for many air quality monitoring studies, and these large particles were estimated to be responsible for most of the deposited mass of metals. Annual averaged values of deposition rates measured with a surrogate surface were in good agreement with values estimated using theoretical deposition velocities in conjunction with measured size-segregated particle concentrations. Image analysis of particles deposited on NRI stage A, which collects all particles greater than 6 mu m, indicated nighttime metal concentrations and deposition at the non-urban coastal site was higher than in the day time due to offshore advection of urban air associated with the diurnal land breeze. Measured enrichments of crustal elements and metals were correlated, indicating efficient mixing of natural and anthropogenic material from different sources, hypothesized to be the result of cyclical resuspension and deposition of dust by moving vehicles and wind.

While the start, end, duration and peaks of the pollen seasons varied between the years, both showed a late occurrence of grass pollen in the air with more than 20 grass pollen/m(3) air in September. This late flowering event is unusual for Austria and was only noticed at the pollen monitoring site in Illmitz. The site is characterised by reed vegetation surrounding the station. The reed plants were determined as Phragmites australis and phenologically monitored in September 2018. The local plants flowered during this period. Thus, the source of the significant grass pollen exposure in September could be attributed to a local phenomenon. Other places surrounded by reed grasses should be monitored to assess the consistency of the observed pattern and variation of the flowering of Phragmites. The exposure to grass pollen has to be communicated to persons affected by grass pollen allergy including the incorporation of such events into pollen forecasting routines.

We report potential Impacts of a native predator, the Lake Erie Watersnake (Nerodio sipdeon insularum) on an Invasive fish, the Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus). Round Gobies have Increased exponentially in the Great Lakes and now constitute >90% of prey consumed by Lake Erie Watersnakes. We Investigated the effects this shift may have on round goby populations by estimating total prey consumption by Lake Erie Watersnakes. Digestive rate trials and maximum voluntary prey consumption trials Indicate that gastric digestion is rapid (digestion was 90% complete after, just 16.4 hours at 30 degrees C and 20.1 hours at 25 degrees C) and voluntary prey consumption is high (from 30.0% of adult female body mass to 117% of neonate body mass In five days). Based on palpation of wild-caught snakes, prey were detected more frequently In adult females than adult males, but no such difference was observed in subadults. The proportion of snakes containing prey varied over time with season-long averages of 11.6% for adult females, 6.9% for adult males, and 22.4% for subadults. Systematic surveys by boat indicate that nearly 90% of foraging occurs <150 m from shore. Projected annual consumption, based on gastric digestion rate, maximum voluntary prey consumption, feeding frequency of free-ranging snakes, and published energetic data and a population size of 12,000 adult watersnakes, ranges from 200,0003,300,000 Round Gobles (4,455-56,178 kg) per year. Although Impressive, this rate of prey consumption is unlikely to have more than local effects on Round Goby populations.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				SEP 3	2009		3					437	445		10.1643/CH-08-119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CH-08-119													WOS:000269782200002

The Effect of Tharthar-Tigris Canal on the Environmental Properties of the Tigris River Northern Baghdad, Iraq	BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL												The present study is considered the first on this sector of the Tigris River after 2003. It is designed for two aims, the first is to demonstrate the seasonal variations in physicochemical parameters of Tharthar-Tigris Canal and Tigris River; the second is to explain the possible effects of canal on some environmental properties in the Tigris River. Water samples were being collected monthly. Six sampling sites were selected, two on Tharthar Canal and four along the Tigris River, one before the confluence as a control site and the others downstream the confluence with the canal. For a period from January to December 2020, nineteen physicochemical parameters were investigated including air and water temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity, salinity dissolved oxygen, percent oxygen saturation, biological oxygen demand, pH, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sulphate, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, total alkalinity, bicarbonate, nitrate and phosphate. The results showed that air and water temperatures were close in both Tigris and canal. The waters were well aerated, slightly alkaline and over saturation was recorded several times, while biological oxygen demand values did not exceed 5 mg/L along study period. The high values of conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, calcium and sulphate ions in Tharthar water increased in the Tigris River below the confluence. Whereas, the low values of turbidity, TSS, total alkalinity and bicarbonate in the arm diluted in the main river. It has been concluded that Tharthar Canal affected the Tigris River by either increasing or diluting of the Tigris chemical components.					; Nashaat, Muhanned/ABB-7938-2020; Majeed, Osama S./GSM-7602-2022; Majeed, Osama/GSM-7602-2022	Nashaat, Muhanned/0000-0001-8063-123X; Majeed, Osama S./0000-0003-2417-8869; 													2078-8665	2411-7986					2022	19	6					1177	1190		10.21123/bsj.2022.6483	http://dx.doi.org/10.21123/bsj.2022.6483													WOS:000922621600003

Ecological State of Lake Gusinoe-A Cooling Pond of the Gusinoozersk GRES	WATER												The study of the transformation of substances in the basin of the Selenga River-the main tributary of Lake Baikal-under anthropogenic pressure and in the context of global climate change, is especially important for the lake, a globally important source of drinking water. The ecosystem of Lake Gusinoe is one of the key objects in the Selenga River basin that is exposed to significant anthropogenic pressure. This study presents the results of an analysis of water level changes and physicochemical parameters of the water mass of Lake Gusinoe; literature data from 1951 to 2017 and own data from 2017 to 2021. The water level in the lake had depended on natural factors before the Gusinoozersk GRES was launched; however, since the plant has begun using the lake as a cooling pond, its level has actually been regulated by the economic entity. Over the years, there has been a significant increase in mineralization, sulfate, sodium, fluoride and organic matter fractions resistant to oxidation. Seasonal increases in iron and manganese concentrations in water were detected. Increased concentrations of nutrients and organic matter fractions resistant to oxidation were registered at the wastewater discharge sites. Heavy metals in the bottom sediments of Lake Gusinoe accumulate mainly in the silt of the deep zone of the lake. Plants growing in the zones of influence of the Gusinoozersk GRES and Gusinoozersk wastewater discharge accumulate the largest amount of metals.

The site clusters by the Vihterpalu palaeolagoon can be dated to the Pre-Pottery Mesolithic or Narva stage (until 5200 BC and 5200-3900 BC, respectively). Human activity by the Velise lagoon probably started at the same time and intensified during the Comb Ware stage (3900-1750 BC). Two mineral surface depressions, sufficient to accommodate remnant lakes and presently covered by peat layers of mires deserve further attention. They are located in the Seljakula, Variku and Keedika villages behind the coastal formations observable by the road connecting the Keila- Haapsalu main road with Nova village. Similar depressions behind the coastal formations in the Teenuse-Velise area are not sufficient for freshwater bodies. The spatial pattern of small-scale aceramic settlement sites by the tributaries of the present-day River Kasari up to 10 km from the palaeocoastline suggests a highly persistent seasonal land use during the Comb Ware stage, comparable to the Neolithic settlement phase of Kunda Lammasmagi.																			1406-2933	1736-7484					2022	26	2					184	208		10.3176/arch.2022.2.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/arch.2022.2.04													WOS:000885480400001
J	Díez, EG; Graham, ND; Loizeau, JL				Diez, Elena Gascon; Graham, Neil D.; Loizeau, Jean-Luc			Total and methyl-mercury seasonal particulate fluxes in the water column of a large lake (Lake Geneva, Switzerland)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Concentrations and fluxes of total and methylmercury were determined in surface sediments and associated with settling particles at two sites in Lake Geneva to evaluate the sources and dynamics of this toxic contaminant. Total mercury concentrations measured in settling particles were different throughout the seasons and were greatly influenced by the Rhone River particulate inputs. Total mercury concentrations closer to shore (NG2) ranged between 0.073 +/- 0.001 and 0.27 +/- 0.01 mu g/g, and between 0.038 +/- 0.001 and 0.214 +/- 0.008 mu g/g at a site deeper in the lake (NG3). Total mercury fluxes ranged between 0.144 +/- 0.002 and 3.0 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(2)/day at NG2, and between 0.102 +/- 0.008 and 1.32 +/- 0.08 mu g/m(2)/day at NG3. Combined results of concentrations and fluxes showed that total mercury concentrations in settling particles are related to the season and particle inputs from the Rhone River. Despite an observed decrease in total mercury fluxes from the coastal zone towards the open lake, NG3 (similar to 3 km from the shoreline) was still affected by the coastal boundary, as compared to distal sites at the center of the lake. Thus, sediment focusing is not efficient enough to redistribute contaminant inputs originating from the coastal zones, to the lake center. Methylmercury concentrations in settling particles largely exceeded the concentrations found in sediments, and their fluxes did not show significant differences with relation to the distance from shore. The methylmercury found associated with settling particles would be related to the lake's internal production rather than the effect of transport from sediment resuspension.

However, we know little about how small elevation gradients (influencing e.g. flooding regimes) and seasonality combine with soil physicochemical properties to influence nutrient stoichiometry in wetland plants. In this study, we examined these factors in Carex brevicuspis at Dongting Lake, China, during the non-flooding periods in March, May and December of 2015 and February of 2016. We found that total foliar C concentration increased as elevation increased, especially during December 2015 and February 2016. At the low-elevation site, total foliar C concentration decreased over the season, whereas it first increased and then decreased over time at higher elevations. Foliar total N and P concentrations decreased from March to May and subsequently increased throughout the season, and these concentrations were always much higher at the low-elevation site. The C:N and C:P ratios first increased and then decreased over the season, while increasing with rising elevation. The N:P ratio was lower at the low-elevation site, especially during May 2015 and February 2016; its variation over time differed across the elevations. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed that soil organic C, total N and soil nitrate N are important for determining C. brevicuspis stoichiometry. Our results suggest that both elevation and plant life stage have a significant influence on plant stoichiometry. This study improves our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of plant nutrients under different geographical conditions.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725													0107-055X	1756-1051				JUL	2018	36	7							e01821	10.1111/njb.01821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/njb.01821													WOS:000439934400001

On the other hand, Qalaa Drain is the polluted source, having over 70% of its water as wastewater from eastern wastewater treatment plant, (EWTP). The present work is an assessment of a seasonal study of heavy metals' discharge from some pump stations into Umum and Qalaa Drains to control the heavy metals pollution load from each Umum and Qalaa to Lake Mariut Main Basin (LMMB). The results indicated that Lake Mariut is still suffering from the massive polluted loads from Qalaa Drain with high concentration of dissolved metals mostly in the sulphide forms. The present study highly recommends the insulation of anoxic water from Qalaa Drain.

Italy). Histopathological analyses were performed on mussels sampled from March 2005 to April 2006, when high DDT levels were found, and results were compared to those from mussels sampled in 2001/2002. before the pollution event. During the 2005/2006 reproductive season, the first male gamete release happened one month later than the onset of spawning in females who showed a high number of specimens with degenerating oocytes, despite a regular pattern of gametogenesis. These results indicated a disrupting action of DDT on the mechanisms involved in sperm release, and a disturbance in the gametogenic phases of the ovary. Pathological pictures in the digestive gland of many mussels from both 2001/2002 and 2005/2006 have also been observed, but DDT pollution is unable to explain the presence of pathological fields in mussels during 2001/2002, for which a previously reported contamination seems to be the main cause. A possible role of DDT in skewing the sex ratio towards a predominance of females was also discussed, considering the high number of females sampled in 2005/2006. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Zooplankton seasonal dynamics in a recently filled mine pit lake: the effect of non-indigenous Daphnia establishment	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We examined the temporal and vertical dynamics of zooplankton in Weavers Lake, New Zealand, between October 2004 and October 2005, at a time when it was colonised by a non-indigenous Daphnia species. Zooplankton community composition changed during the study from one of rotifer dominance (e.g. Asplanchna, Polyarthra, Brachionus and Keratella species) to cladoceran (Daphnia dentifera) dominance. Temporal changes in zooplankton community composition were strongly associated with a gradual increase in lake water clarity, and were attributable to the highly efficient filter feeding of D. dentifera. The corresponding reduction in rotifer densities may have resulted from the superior competitive abilities of the newly established Daphnia. As Daphnia were rare inhabitants of New Zealand lakes before 1990, the arrival and rapid spread of the non-indigenous D. dentifera has lead to widespread changes in both water clarity and zooplankton community composition. An apparent lack of mixing in the lake was facilitated by the lake's extremely small surface area:depth ratio. However, we conclude that physical features of the lake had minimal influence on water clarity relative to the invasion of D. dentifera.

Furthermore, no studies have examined selection of den sites at multiple spatial scales. We examined den-site selection for 48 raccoons during 1997-1999 in an agricultural landscape in the Black Prairie physiographic region of east-central Mississippi, USA. Den types selected by raccoons differed by gender and season. Females used more cavity dens during young rearing, whereas males selected ground dens and brush piles. We found that den sites were located closer to crop fields, roads, and macrohabitat edges than random points. At the landscape level, den sites were associated positively with woody patch size, amounts of woody and grass edge, number of available patches of crop fields, and available area of lakes and ponds. Composition of habitats around den sites differed from composition of habitats within home ranges, and this difference also was noted by gender. Female raccoons selected crop fields, whereas males selected lakes/ponds relative to composition of habitats Within their respective home ranges. Our results indicate the importance of tree cavities to females during young rearing, particularly on prairie landscapes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that on prairie landscapes, availability of foraging habitat and water may influence den-site selection. We suggest that raccoons select den sites based on a perceived arrangement of required resources and that landscape configuration is important in the den-selection process. Additionally, our findings offer evidence that managers may selectively remove den sites as a nonlethal means of managing predation by raccoons.					; Burger, L./AAR-6767-2020	Burger, Jr., L.

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In Lake Kinneret (the biblical Sea of Galilee), Israel, internal waves of significant amplitude are induced by westerly winds. These waves give rise to upwelling into the surface mixed layer of colder, oxygen-depleted water from the hypolimnetic and metalimnetic layers. If upwelling occurs soon after the onset of annual thermal stratification, when surface mixed layer extends over a narrow depth range, but the hypolimnion is already anoxic, there is a potential for massive fish kills as fish cannot escape the anoxic water that intrudes into the surface mixed layer along the western shore. This study uses a coupled three-dimensional atmosphere-lake model to elucidate the mechanisms behind these infrequent major fish kills in Lake Kinneret. Remarkably, nowadays fish-kill events happen at the same location in the lake where the biblical Miracle of Loaves and Fishes and presumably the Miraculous Catch of Fish occurred two millennia before the present and may explain the appearance of large numbers of easy-to-collect fish close to the shore described in the biblical narratives.

Anthropogenic Influence and Climate Change: Water and Nutrient Dynamics in the Kebir-Rhumel Basin, (Northeastern Algeria)	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												This study investigates the Anthropogenic Influence and Climate Change: Water and Nutrient Dynamics in the Kebir-Rhumel Basin in Northeastern Algeria. Utilizing an advanced methodology and integrating ten physicochemical variables, this research provides a novel insight into the environmental factors shaping the basin's ecosystem. Employing a PCA analysis highlights two distinct factors accounting for 80.90% of the total variance and identifies a strong positive correlation between various variables, particularly NH4 and PO4 two contrasting river areas were noted: Oued Radjas and Oued Rhumel rivers, which display evidence of anthropogenic activities, and Oued Kebir and Oued ElKotone rivers, which indicate pristine conditions. The observed seasonal fluctuations in atmospheric conditions and surface water parameters highlight the significant influence of human activities on water quality and ecosystem health. These insights emphasize the urgency for continuous environmental monitoring and effective management strategies to safeguard aquatic ecosystems against the detrimental effects of anthropogenic pressures. The findings here are not only significant in understanding the dynamics of water quality but also crucial in devising effective management strategies. High EC and TDS values in the Oued Radjas River point to anthropogenic pollution, and high nitrogen nutrient concentrations in the Oued El-Kotonne River hint at potential eutrophication. The study underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between human activities and natural processes in managing water resources and ecosystems. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by shedding light on specific aspects of water quality in the region, paving the way for more focused investigations and policy interventions for sustainable development.																			1790-7632					OCT	2024	26	7							006014	10.55555/gnj.006014	http://dx.doi.org/10.55555/gnj.006014													WOS:001297722100002

However, the driving mechanisms of land use and landscape patterns (LULP) affecting their trophic interactions are not fully understood. Therefore, the research objective of this study was to reveal the driving mechanisms of LULP on the interaction of phytoplankton with zooplankton through remote sensing interpretation of LULP in different buffer scales (500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, and catchment), combined with water environment factors and plankton community structures analyzed. Results showed that LULP had the most significant effect on the phytoplankton and the zooplankton community structure at 500 and 1500 m buffer scales, respectively. Construction land (CON) and edge density (ED) most influenced phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure and their influence mechanisms were identified, i.e., CON increased the species (S) of phytoplankton by increasing the concentration of NO3-N in river water at the 500 m buffer scale. ED reduced the biological density (BD) of zooplankton by decreasing the concentration of heavy metal (HM) in river water at the 1500 m buffer scale. The water area (WAT) and ED showed the most significant influence on plankton interaction. Three pathways were found to explain their influence mechanisms, i.e., ED decreased the BD or Shannon-Weiner index (H') of zooplankton by increasing the dissolved oxygen (DO) to enhance BD of phytoplankton in river water at the 1500 m buffer scale; the WAT increased the BD of phytoplankton by increasing water temperature to reduce the H ' of zooplankton at the 500 m buffer. These findings have implications for effective ecological planning of future human activities in the stream domain and maintaining river ecosystem health.

Data-driven models, while promising, struggle with nonstationary lake level changes and complex dependencies on meteorological factors, limiting their applicability. Here, we introduce the Hydroformer, a frequency domain enhanced multi-attention Transformer model designed for monthly lake level reconstruction, utilizing reanalysis data. This model features two innovative mechanisms: (a) Frequency-Enhanced Attention (FEA) for capturing long-term temporal dependence, and (b) Causality-based Cross-dimensional Attention (CCA) to elucidate how specific meteorological factors influence lake level. Seasonal and trend patterns of catchment meteorological factors and lake level are initially identified by a time series decomposition block, then independently learned and refined within the model. Tested across 50 lakes globally, the Hydroformer excelled in reconstruction periods ranging from half to three times the training-test length. The model exhibited good performance even when training data missing rates were below 50%, particularly in lakes with significant seasonal fluctuations. The Hydroformer demonstrated robust generalization across lakes of varying sizes, from 10.11 to 18,135 km2, with median values for R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE at 0.813, 0.313, 0.215, and 0.4, respectively. Furthermore, the Hydroformer outperformed data-driven models, improving MSE by 29.2% and MAE by 24.4% compared to the next best model, the FEDformer. Our method proposes a novel approach for reconstructing long-term water level changes and managing lake resources under climate change. Lake water levels, as key indicators of hydrologic dynamics and catchment balance, are vital for understanding climate impacts and managing water resources. However, the lack of continuous measurements for most global lakes, combined with the inability of traditional data-driven models to effectively decipher complex interactions with catchment hydrological processes, leads to significant gaps in generalizability, accuracy, and reconstructive length. Given these limitations, accurate monthly reconstructions of lake level remain a persistent challenge. To address this, we develop Hydroformer, an innovative frequency domain enhanced multi-attention Transformer model, utilizing reanalysis data for monthly lake level reconstruction. It employs two innovative attention mechanisms: Frequency-Enhanced Attention for capturing long-term temporal dependencies and Causality-based Cross-dimensional Attention for cross-dimensional causal dependencies between catchment meteorological factors and lake level. Through a decomposition block, the model efficiently recognizes and refines inherent seasonal and trend patterns, leading to a comprehensive understanding of lake behaviors. Through testing on 50 global lakes, the Hydroformer has exhibited exceptional performance in reconstructing water levels for lakes ranging from 10.11 to 18,135 km2, adeptly handling short-term, long-term, and varying proportions of data gaps. It notably outperforms supervised data-driven models. This positions it as a vital instrument for monthly lake level reconstruction, showcasing the power of integrating advanced artificial intelligence techniques in hydrological modeling. A novel frequency domain enhanced multi-attention Transformer model, Hydroformer, has been built for reconstructing monthly lake level using reanalysis data The model accurately extends reconstructions 2-3 times the training data length, excelling with less than 50% missing training data Hydroformer surpasses advanced AI-based models, improving MSE and MAE by over 20% and demonstrating strong generalization across lakes of varying sizes					Wei, Jiahua/AAA-8543-2019; Zhang, Wenqian/HPG-4200-2023														0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2024	60	10							e2024WR037166	10.1029/2024WR037166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037166													WOS:001321821500001

With the extraordinary preservation of complete wooden spears and butchered large mammal bones dating from the Middle Pleistocene, Schoningen maintains a prominent position in the halls of human origins worldwide. Here, we present the first analysis of the complete large mammal faunal assemblage from Schoningen 13II-4, drawing on multiple lines of zooarchaeological and taphonomic evidence to expose the full spectrum of hominin activities at the site-before, during, and after the hunt. Horse ( Equus mosbachensis) ) remains dominate the assemblage and suggest a recurrent ambush hunting strategy along the margins of the Schoningen paleo-lake. In this regard, Schoningen 13II-4 provides the first undisputed evidence for hunting of a single prey species that can be studied from an in situ, open-air context. The Schoningen hominins likely relied on cooperative hunting strategy to target horse family groups, to the near exclusion of bachelor herds. Horse kills occurred during all seasons, implying a year-round presence of hominins on the Schoningen landscape. All portions of prey skeletons are represented in the assemblage, many complete and in semiarticulation, with little transport of skeletal parts away from the site. Butchery marks are abundant, and adult carcasses were processed more thoroughly than were juveniles. Numerous complete, unmodified bones indicated that lean meat and marrow were not always so highly prized, especially in events involving multiple kills when fat and animal hides may have received greater attention. The behaviors displayed at Schoningen continue to challenge our perceptions and models of past hominin lifeways, further cementing Schoningen's standing as the archetype for understanding hunting adaptations during the European Middle Pleistocene.

Relatively little attention has been given to multi-taxon aquatic biota in extreme alpine environments. We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of alpha and beta diversity, site-specific contributions to beta diversity and assembly mechanisms of four taxonomic groups (fishes, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and phytoplankton) from the source to the estuary of the Za'gya Zangbo River above 4500 m AMSL (above mean sea level) on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan (Q-T) Plateau. A total of 4 fish species, 45 macroinvertebrate taxa, 17 zooplankton taxa and 56 phytoplankton taxa were found in the study area. No consistent patterns in taxonomic richness were observed across taxa from upstream to estuary. The fish communities had the lowest dissimilarity between communities, the phytoplankton community had the highest dissimilarity in the dry season, and the macroinvertebrate community had the highest dissimilarity in the wet season. The relative importance of the turnover and nestedness components varied considerably across taxa and along spatial gradients. The diversity patterns of macroinvertebrate, zooplankton and phytoplankton communities were significantly correlated with several environmental factors, whereas only the beta diversity of fish was correlated with altitude. Stochastic processes dominated in shaping the macroinvertebrate communities whereas deterministic processes dominated the assembly of the phytoplankton communities. Weak congruence of diversity patterns across taxonomic groups suggested that biological groups cannot serve as reliable surrogates for one another and that multiple biological groups should be included in the biomonitoring of high-altitude rivers on the Q-T Plateau. The relatively unique species in the upstream area and estuary of the Za'gya Zangbo River harbor should receive more attention in future conservation and management schemes.

Hidden gems: Scattered knowledge hampered freshwater jellyfish research over the past one-and-a-half centuries	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Freshwater jellyfish (= limnic medusa-budding hydrozoans, FWJ) are a small group of cnidarians found on all continents except Antarctica in temperate to tropical latitudes. Members of this group belong primarily to three genera: Astrohydra, Craspedacusta, and Limnocnida. While Astrohydra and Limnocnida are typically restricted to the islands of Japan, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, one species or potential species complex, Craspedacusta sowerbii, became globally invasive. Despite research going back about one-and-a-half centuries, little is known about their phylogeny and ecology compared to marine jellyfish. Recent species distribution modelling, however, showed that by 2050, C. sowerbii will potentially extend their distribution ranges due to global warming to high-latitude ecosystems and be present (medusa stage) for an extended time in the seasonal limnic production cycle. An increase in their relative ecological importance with temporal and spatial spreading is hypothesised. Only recently, it has been shown that the trophic roles of polyps and medusae and their prey overlap with other ecosystem members. In addition, medusa behaviour may cause trophic cascades and alter vertical nutrient distributions. However, polyps and other benthic life cycle stages are understudied. In globally, changing freshwater ecosystems that may become more accommodating for FWJ, an improved understanding of their population biology and ecosystem ecology is urgently needed. In this integrative review, we, therefore, explore reasons for the hampered historical research progress, contrast developments with those of marine cnidarians, compile and publish alongside an extensive and unprecedented literature database, and formulate avenues for future directions in FWJ research.					; Marchessaux, Guillaume/ABF-2730-2021; Lopez-González, Pablo/Y-6440-2018; Manko, Maciej/NJR-5913-2025; Caputo, Luciano/Q-8081-2019	Marchessaux, Guillaume/0000-0001-5557-2274; Lopez Gonzalez, Pablo Jose/0000-0002-7348-6270; Caputo, Luciano/0000-0001-7975-3192; Manko, Maciej Karol/0000-0001-6872-0256; Luskow, Florian/0000-0002-2100-7012; Karunarathne, Krishan D./0000-0003-1780-9749													2045-7758					OCT	2024	14	10							e70350	10.1002/ece3.70350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70350								39355110					WOS:001322685300001

Fire history in northern Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests across a distinct gradient in productivity	FIRE ECOLOGY												BackgroundUnderstanding the role of fire in forested landscapes is fundamental to fire reintroduction efforts, yet few studies have examined how fire dynamics vary in response to interactions between local conditions, such as soil productivity, and more broadscale changes in climate. In this study, we examined historical fire frequency, seasonality, and spatial patterning in mixed conifer forests across a distinct gradient of soil productivity in the northern Sierra Nevada. We cross-dated 46 different wood samples containing 377 fire scars from 6 paired sites, located on and off of ultramafic serpentine soils. Forests on serpentine-derived soils have slower growth rates, lower biomass accumulation, and patchier vegetation than adjacent, non-serpentine sites. Due to these differences, we hypothesized that historical fire frequency and spatial extent would be reduced in mixed conifer forests growing on serpentine soils.ResultsFire scars revealed a history of frequent fire at all of our sites (median composite interval: 6-22.5 years) despite clear differences in soil productivity. Fire frequency was slightly shorter in more productive non-serpentine sites, but this difference was not consistently significant within our sample pairs. While fires were frequent, both on and off of serpentine, they were also highly asynchronous, and this was largely driven by differing climate-fire relationships. Fires in more productive sites were strongly associated with drought conditions in the year of the fire, while fires in less productive serpentine sites appeared to be more dependent on a cycle of wet and dry conditions in the years preceding the fire. Widespread fires that crossed the boundary between serpentine and non-serpentine were associated with drier than normal years.ConclusionsIn our study, fine-scale variation in historical fire regime attributes was linked to both bottom-up and top-down controls. Understanding how these factors interact to create variation in fire frequency, timing, and spatial extent can help managers more effectively define desired conditions, develop management objectives, and identify management strategies for fire reintroduction and forest restoration projects. AntecedentesEl entender el rol del fuego en paisajes forestales es fundamental en los esfuerzos destinados a su reintroducci & oacute;n; sin embargo, pocos estudios han examinado c & oacute;mo la din & aacute;mica del fuego varia en respuesta a las interacciones entre condiciones locales, como la productividad del suelo, y cambios a gran escala en el clima. En este estudio, examinamos la frecuencia hist & oacute;rica del fuego, su estacionalidad, y patrones espaciales, en bosques mixtos de con & iacute;feras a lo largo de un gradiente de distinta productividad del suelo en el norte de la Sierra Nevada. Para ello, cruzamos datos de 46 muestras de le & ntilde;os conteniendo 377 cicatrices de fuego en seis sitios apareados ubicados dentro y fuera de suelos serpentinos ultram & oacute;rficos. Los bosques en los suelos derivados de serpentinas tuvieron una tasa de crecimiento menor, menos acumulaci & oacute;n de biomasa y vegetaci & oacute;n en parches, que los suelos de sitos adyacentes no serpentinos. Debido a esas diferencias, hipotetizamos que la frecuencia hist & oacute;rica y la extensi & oacute;n espacial de los incendios puede ser m & aacute;s reducida en bosques mixtos de con & iacute;feras que crecen en suelos serpentinos.ResultadosLas cicatrices revelaron una historia de fuegos frecuentes en todos los sitios (el intervalo de la mediana compuesta fue de entre 6 y 22,5 a & ntilde;os), a pesar de las claras diferencias en la productividad de los suelos. La frecuencia de fuegos fue ligeramente m & aacute;s corta en sitios no serpentinos m & aacute;s productivos, aunque esta diferencia no fue consistentemente significativa dentro de los pares analizados. Cuando los fuegos fueron frecuentes, tanto en suelos serpentinos como en no serpentinos, se presentaron tambi & eacute;n como altamente asincr & oacute;nicos, y esto fue motivado mayoritariamente por diferencias en la relaci & oacute;n entre fuego y clima. Los fuegos en los sitios m & aacute;s productivos estuvieron fuertemente asociados con las condiciones de sequ & iacute;a en el a & ntilde;o de ocurrencia del fuego, mientras que los fuegos en sitios serpentinos menos productivos parecen ser m & aacute;s dependientes de ciclos de condiciones de sequ & iacute;a y humedad en los a & ntilde;os precedentes a los fuegos. Los fuegos que se expandieron y cruzaron los bordes entre suelos serpentinos y no serpentinos se asociaron con per & iacute;odos m & aacute;s secos que en a & ntilde;os normales.ConclusionesEn nuestro estudio, la variaci & oacute;n a escala fina en los atributos de los reg & iacute;menes hist & oacute;ricos de fuego, estuvo ligada a las variaciones de control de los tipos bottom-upy top-down. El entender c & oacute;mo esos factores interact & uacute;an para crear variaciones en la frecuencia del fuego, el tiempo de ocurrencia, y su extensi & oacute;n espacial, puede ayudar a los gestores a definir de una manera m & aacute;s efectiva las condiciones deseadas, desarrollar objetivos de manejo, e identificar estrategias para la reintroducci & oacute;n del fuego y en proyectos de restauraci & oacute;n.					; Coppoletta, Michelle/U-7283-2019; Stephens, Scott L./LZE-8966-2025; Collins, Brandon/JSL-4289-2023	Coppoletta, Michelle/0000-0001-5640-3237; 													1933-9747					SEP 27	2024	20	1							86	10.1186/s42408-024-00322-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42408-024-00322-7													WOS:001325062000002

They essentially represent "strongly eroded" (Shibanqiao) and "mildly eroded" (Xiaohe) regions in Guizhou Plateau, southwestern China. Sediment cores were retrieved from the two reservoirs and soils were also sampled from their catchments. Mineral magnetic measurements were performed on the sediments and soils, and the particle-size analysis of selected sediment cores and soil profiles were also made. SIRM versus chi if was used to compare sediment and soil samples. In addition, correlations between percentages of different particle-size fractions and magnetic parameters/ratios of sediment samples were also checked. These results revealed differences in sediment sources and soil erosion in these two representative catchments. The sediments in Shibanqiao Reservoir are derived from both the topsoil and subsoil. When erosion is relatively weak, it is limited to the topsoil and preferentially transports the relatively finer magnetic grains into the reservoir, which may imply rain splash and/or sheet erosion. In this relatively steep catchment, stronger erosional forces are capable of not only moving relatively coarser ferrimagnetic grains from the topsoil, but also incising the subsoil and moving anti-ferromagnetic minerals into the reservoir, which seems to hint at not only sheet-wash but also rill and gully erosion. As there are no stable streams nor channel networks developed in this mountainous catchment, contributions from river-bank erosion to sediment yield are almost negligible. The sediments in Xiaohe Reservoir, which has a lower relief, are predominately derived from topsoil erosion. Here, erosion is concentrated to the topsoil and preferentially transports the relatively fine magnetic grains into the reservoir when erosional forces are weak. However, even when erosional forces increase in this relatively flat catchment, erosion is still restricted to the topsoil. Thus, relatively coarser ferrimagnetic grains from the topsoil are transported to the reservoir, but the subsoil remains undisturbed and there are no significant changes in the proportion of anti-ferromagnetic minerals in the sediments. Consequently, only sheet-washing occurs even when erosion is intensifying in this hilly plain catchment. In general, the more effective erosion in the Shibanqiao Catchment is probably due to its steeper topography than Xiaohe Catchment, although higher and more seasonal rainfalls and lower percentages of woodlands may also contribute to the differences in susceptibility to erosional forces.

These variables can interact with important factors such as sex, body size, and life-history stage to shape the spatial ecology of aquatic animals such as freshwater turtles. We used radio-telemetry to study seasonal movement patterns and home-range size of juvenile and adult Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) both in a small lake and in a large river in eastern Ontario, Canada. Adult females in the lotic environment moved longer distances and had larger home ranges than conspecifics from the lentic environment. Males and juvenile females at each site had similar patterns of space use. A seasonal effect on movement was only apparent for adult females in the lotic environment in which adult females moved longer distances during the nesting season. Differences in swimming abilities resulting from a larger body size, in natal homing, or in nest site availability are potential factors explaining the site difference in the spatial ecology of adult females. Our findings illustrate the complexity of interactions shaping patterns of space use by aquatic reptiles.

J	Talbot, HM; Watson, DF; Pearson, EJ; Farrimond, P				Talbot, HM; Watson, DF; Pearson, EJ; Farrimond, P			Diverse biohopanoid compositions of non-marine sediments	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Biohopanoid compositions were determined for modern sediments from 27 lacustrine environments and 1 near coastal lagoon. GC-MS analysis of existing hopanols and those produced by a side-chain cleavage reaction (periodic acid and sodium borohydride) of the bacteriohopanepolyols provided quantitative data for bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT), bacteriohopanepentol, and composite tetra-, penta- and hexafunctionalised biohopanoids. Additional analysis of acetylated total extracts by HPLC-APCI-MS has allowed us to identify up to seven intact bacteriohopanepolyols in these environments, including the first direct observation of 35-aminobacteriohopanepentol in environmental samples. This method is complementary to the periodic acid approach in providing more specific compositional information. The lacustrine environments exhibit a wide range of compositions, many with high inputs of hexafunctionalised biohopanoids (up to 60% of total tetra-, penta- and hexafunctionalised biohopanoids), indicative of major contributions to the sediment from Type I methanotrophic bacteria. Several methylated biohopanoids were also detected in most of the samples with 2beta as the dominant configuration of the methyl group; 2beta-methylbacteriohopanetetrol was by far the most abundant and most commonly occurring compound of this type and comprised the most abundant bacteriohopanepolyol in one saline lake (Laguna Grande, Spain). Such compounds are believed to be derived from cyanobacteria, currently the only known quantitatively-significant source of 2beta-methylated biohopanoids. Biohopanoids containing a methyl group at C-3 were also detected in a limited number of environments. These data demonstrate the wide variability in bacteriohopanepolyol compositions among depositional environments, and the potential of these compounds to preserve bacterial source information and, thereby, to record environmental change.

Monitoring eutrophic processes is therefore highly important to human health and to the aquatic environment. However, the spatial and seasonal distribution of the phenomena and its dynamic are difficult to be resolved using conventional methods as water sampling or sparse acquisition of remote sensing data. This research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced temporal unmixing model to estimate the abundance of [Chia] and algae species in San Roque reservoir, Argentina, in the period August 2016 to August 2019. The spatial patterns and the temporal tendencies of these aquatic indicators, that have a direct link to Eutrophication, were analysed and evaluated using in situ data in order to assess their contribution to the local water management.

Heavy Metals Accumulation in Surface Waters, Bottom Sediments and Aquatic Organisms in Lake Mainit, Philippines	INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES												Lake Mainit is one of the largest lakes recognized as one of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in the Philippines with rich fishery resources. However, the lake is at risk from heavy metal contamination due to inputs of industrial, agricultural effluents and small-scale mining activities. The present work evaluated levels of heavy metals namely cadmium, lead, and mercury from key aquatic fauna and sediments from seven strategic sections of the lake in 2018. Muscle samples of all seven fish species assessed were below detections limits (BDL) for tHg and Cd. Trace concentrations of Pb in the muscles were detected in Oreochromis niloticus, Glossogobius giuris, Channa striata and Vivipara angularis but values were within safe ranges. Trace concentrations of Pb in the riverine crab (Sundathelpusa sp) exceeded safe limits. Both Cd and tHg were below detection limits in the three invertebrates assessed. Traces of Pb were detected in S4 (Magtiaco) and S5 (Jaliobong) below standard limits (0.05 ppm) only during the southwest (SW) monsoon but Pb were not detected across all stations during the NE monsoon of 2018. For Cd, however, trace concentrations were detected only during the NE monsoon wherein Cd in S2 (Mayag), S3 (Magpayang), S4 (Magtiaco), S5 (Jaliobong), S6 (Dinarawan) and S7 (Kalinawan) exceeded standard limits for Cd in waters (0.01 ppm). Concentrations of tHg in the water were not detected across the two sampling seasons in all seven tributary stations. In sediments, Pb were all detected during the southwest monsoon with highest Pb concentrations in S6 (Dinarawan) and S7 (Kalinawan) which exceeded safe limits. Trace Cd in sediments were mostly below detectable limits. Concentrations of tHg in sediments exceeded safe limits during the SE monsoon in S4 (Magtiaco) and S7 (Kalinawan) areas. These findings recommended that continuous heavy metal monitoring must be conducted. It is also strongly suggested to evaluate the presence of heavy metals in other aquatic organisms and assess the ecological risk posed by these heavy metals though heavy metal speciation analysis.

Numerical modelling of ice-front oscillations and ice-dam occurrence at Glaciar Perito Moreno, the Southern Patagonia Icefield	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												The present study conducts the design and development of a computational numerical model to describe the behavior of the seasonal oscillatory cycle of advance and recession of the Perito Moreno glacier, named MO-AGAR. Within its oscillatory behavior, in some years the glacier advances and reaches the Magellan Peninsula forming an ice-dam that break down due to the water pressure of the lake after a certain time. Thus, the main goal of the MO-AGAR model is to simulate the daily ice-front position of the glacier and the events occurrence of the ice-dam formation during 1994-2018 period. The model is calibrated and validated from an iterative optimization process, based on the maximization of correlation values and minimization of distance errors to the Magallanes Peninsula. The simulation of the ice-dam's formation and the oscillation of the frontal position achieved high performance, reaching optimal correlation values (0.99) and small errors in the position (9.56 +/- 13.94 in), respectively. The results show that glacier dynamics and ice-dam's formation respond to different time-scales; whilst in short-, intermediate-term (daily seasonal scales), the occurrence depends as much on the characteristics of the event as on the phase and intensity of the previous event. On the contrary, in long-term periods (scales greater than one year), low-frequency modulation of the ice flow velocity, caused by variations in air temperature, controls the periods with the formation of ice-dams and free of them.

This research was conducted in the tidal flats of the Liaohe estuary wetland. (2) Methods: The Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating technique was used to reconstruct the time correspondence between tidal flat sediments and runoff, and the periodic response was explored between the changes in the tidal flat sediments and runoff based on the spectrum analysis method. (3) Results: The average sedimentation rate in the tidal flat was 2.24 cmyear(-1) during the past 50 years. The amount of fine sediment particles deposited on the estuary tidal flat was directly related to the amount of sediments transported by the river and inversely proportional to the ability of rivers to transport fine matter. The high frequency reproduction cycle of 14-15 years in the flood season flow and 5-6 years in the annual sediment discharge of the Liaohe River correspond to the high and low frequency reproduction cycles of the median size of sediments in Liaohe estuarine wetland tidal flats. (4) Conclusions: The research clarified the hydrological constraints of the action law between Liaohe River runoff and the estuarine sediments. The periodic response between Liaohe River runoff and the sediment was established.					; Li, Lifeng/JRW-2275-2023	wang, tieliang/0000-0002-9773-243X; Li, Lifeng/0000-0001-9817-7661														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							61	10.3390/w12010061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010061													WOS:000519847200061

The implications of such measures, however, remain unclear, since watershed hydrology and the related transfer of materials to the lake are affected by local climate variables, hydrological shifts, and vegetation cover variables. Sediment from Wanghu Lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have apparently been affected by land cover changes and lake-river system transitions caused by a sluice gate built at Fuchi in 1967. These changes influenced the watershed hydrology, thereby confounding paleoclimatic and paleohydrologic interpretations by proxy records in sediment cores. We collected sediment cores from the center of Wanghu Lake and analyzed trends in pollen and physical properties through sedimentary records to investigate land cover changes and hydrological transitions during the past 90 years. The grain size of the sediment core increased with precipitation and the significant relationships between pollen and grain size after 1967 indicated that sediment transfer to the lake was controlled by rainfall and land cover changes due to human-induced deforestation and farming in the lake catchment. Interestingly before 1967, there was no significant relationship between the pollen and grain size or between the precipitation and grain size, indicating that the sediment of WanghuLake was not simply from the lake catchment. The different relationships patterns before and after 1967 indicated that the sediments in the lake were not only transported following precipitation and discharge from the lake catchment but also came from the Yangtze River draining back into the lake during the flood seasons before 1967. These results highlight matters needing attention and the potential application of grain size of sediments for reconstructions of past hydro-environmental changes.																				2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							45	10.3390/w12010045	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010045													WOS:000519847200045

To this aim, we assessed the hydrological and physico-chemical dynamics of two contrasting streams in Andean Patagonia: Casa de Piedra (CP) and Gutierrez (G). CP originates in a small lake (0.15 km(2)) situated at high-elevation, whereas the source of G is a large (17 km(2)) piedmont lake. There are other differences between the drainage basins of these streams: CP drainage basin covers 63 km(2) and slopes steep (33.9 m/km), while that of G is bigger (162 km(2)) and gentler (5.9 m/km). The current research was carried out over a period of 1 year. Variables measured were precipitation and temperature, as well as hydrological data (Q = discharge, EC = electrical conductivity, water temperature, turbidity and pH). The climate and topography of the region led to 3 distinct hydrological periods: stormflow, meltflow and baseflow. Discharge presented a clear seasonal pattern with higher values at meltflow, due to snow melting from the mountains. Stream CP was very flashy (high variation in flow regime), unlike stream G. The greatest flashiness was observed during the stormflow period. Baseflow was characterised by low values of Q. The temperature of water fluctuated between the different hydrological periods and between the study streams, whereas pH varied seasonally only. Great turbidity in the streams was observed during the stormflow period, as a result of high run-off. Throughout the year, the relation between Q and EC in CP revealed different hydrological flowpaths towards the stream: flows derived from melting snow, lateral flows through the landscape and groundwater flows. In contrast, EC in stream G was high and constant during the whole recording period, independently of Q. This indicates that the large headwater lake is its main source of water. This lake clearly affected the physico-chemical dynamics of stream G. In brief, the current research brought new knowledge into the ecological aspects of hydrological processes acting on the Andean-Patagonian aquatic ecosystems. On the basis of the results presented here and on expected future trends, we believe that the hydrological and physico-chemical dynamics of these ecosystems will be highly affected by climate change.

Changes in wind speed, precipitation, temperature, and humidity due to climate change can cause desertification and dust storms, and increase the intensity of such phenomena. Human activity such as land development and overgrazing destroy vegetation cover, and cause the occurrence of aggravation of desertification and dust storms as a result; upstream irrigation and urbanization can lead to the seasonal drying up of downstream rivers, lakes and other water bodies and thus become a new or enhanced source of sand. So far, natural sandstorm activity is still the main source of sand and dust input into the atmosphere. The main areas of modern sandstorm activity may become drier in the future due to climate change. As for the subject of land use by humans, it is necessary for us to pay close attention to its long-term effects on the climate and also on its interaction with various climate elements and the environmental effects caused by such interactions. The deployment of the appropriate technical measures can play a role in alleviating desertification and dust storms.

J	Smith, K; Strong, C; Rassoul-Agha, F				Smith, Kimberly; Strong, Courtenay; Rassoul-Agha, Firas			A New Method for Generating Stochastic Simulations of Daily Air Temperature for Use in Weather Generators	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A stochastic harmonic autoregressive parametric (SHArP) weather generator is presented that simulates trended, nonstationary temperature values directly, circumventing the conventional approach of adding simulated standardized anomalies of temperature to a prescribed cyclostationary mean. The model mean makes autocorrelated transitions between wet-and dry-state values, and its parameters are determined by optimizing harmonic and trend terms. The precipitation-responsive autocorrelated transitions yield more realistic temperature behavior during frontal passage in comparison with prior models that switch abruptly between wet-and dry-state means. If the stochastic (noise) term is assumed to have constant amplitude, analytical results are available via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and are equivalent to least squares estimation (LSE). Where observations motivate a seasonally varying noise coefficient, MLE becomes nonlinear, and an analytical solution is formulated via LSE. For illustration, SHArP is shown to produce realistic representations of daily maximum air temperature at a single site, which for the study is the Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC). SHArP reduces the temperature bias following frontal passages by over 2 degrees C in three seasons. A method for generalizing the model to multiple variables at multiple sites is discussed.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				APR	2017	56	4					953	963		10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0122.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0122.1													WOS:000399680900018

The Enterococcus sp. densities at the seven sampling stations were highly influenced by tidal fluctuations and season. The distributions and diversities of species varied in the inner and outer regions of Port Blair Bay. Among the 1816 total isolates, the occurrence of fecal Enterococcus was high (1.78 x 10(4) CFU/100 mL) in Phoenix Bay. Moreover, 67.76% of the isolates were identified as Enterococcus, and the most frequently identified species were E. hi roe, E. avium and E. faecalis. Assessments of antibiotic resistance and biomarker genes revealed the maximum occurrence in the Aberdeen Bay isolates. The most prevalent biomarker genes observed in the E. faecalis isolates were gelE and asal, whereas cyl was not found among the isolates. In silico sequence analysis of biomarker genes of E. faecalis also revealed that they are evolutionarily well conserved with those of earlier reports. Further, multivariate analysis distinguished the JB, PB and OS stations from the other stations according to distinctive microbial densities and compositions. In addition, the Shannon-Wiener diversity indices and box-whisker plots further facilitated and supported the multivariate results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Why do phyto- and zooplankton exhibit different patterns of seasonal dynamics in the large Ob river-floodplain system (West Siberia)?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A floodplain is considered as the basis for high production and biodiversity of large rivers. To test the hypothesis of the determining role of the floodplain as a supplier of plankton to the channel of a large unregulated river, we implemented a three-year study in the Ob river-floodplain (West Siberia, Russia) and revealed that factors of seasonal dynamics and sources of phyto- and zooplankton supply to the channel differed. The riverine phytoplankton was formed mostly in the main river and small side channels. The driving factor of its seasonal dynamics in the main channel and the permanently connected floodplain was water temperature, whereas in mostly isolated floodplain lakes-it was the availability of nutrients. Zooplankton in the channel was largely formed due to "recruits" arrival from the floodplain reaches. Its abundance in the channel with connection to the river-floodplain areas depended on temperature and phytoplankton amount. This study casts a light upon some major factors of seasonal dynamics of phyto- and zooplankton in the river-floodplain systems of large lowland rivers and serves the basis for the development of the flood pulse concept and monitoring program for rivers with a long freeze-up period.

J	Breuer, L; Papen, H; Butterbach-Bahl, K				Breuer, L; Papen, H; Butterbach-Bahl, K			N2O emission from tropical forest soils of Australia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Three different tropical rain forest sites (Kauri Creek, Lake Eacham, and Massey Creek) on the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, Australia, were investigated for the magnitude of N2O emission from soils during different seasons, that is, wet season, dry season, and transition periods. Highest mean N2O emission rates were observed for soils derived from granite at the Kauri Creek site with 74.5 +/- 25.2 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), whereas for soils derived from Metamorphics (Lake Eacham site) mean N2O emission rates were much lower (13.1 +/- 1.1 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). For the Massey Creek site, with soils derived from Rhyolite, a mean annual N2O emission rate of 46.2 +/- 1.1 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) was calculated. The mean annual N2O emission rate calculated for all three sites over the entire observation period was 39.0 mug N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and thus at the high end of reports from tropical rain forest soils. N2O emission rates showed at all sites pronounced temporal as well as spatial variability. The magnitude of N2O emissions was strongly linked to rainfall events; that is, N2O emissions strongly increased approximately 6-8 hours after precipitation. Correlation analysis confirmed the strong dependency of N2O emissions on changes in soil moisture, whereas changes in soil temperature did not mediate considerable changes in N2O fluxes. Spatial variability of N2O fluxes on a site scale could be explained best by differences in water-filled pore space, CO2 emission, and C/N ratio of the soil. On the basis of all published N2O flux rates from tropical rain forest soils we recalculated the contribution of such forests to the global atmospheric N2O budget and come up with a figure of 3.55 Tg N2O-N yr(-1), which is approximately 50% higher than reported by others.

The model was applied to an oligotrophic, dimictic high altitude lake (Lake Redo, Pyrenees) for a range of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. High altitude lakes, which receive their contaminant inputs uniquely from the atmosphere through long-range atmospheric transport, provide ideal controlled environments for the study of the interactions between atmospheric depositional and water column biogeochemical processes. The BIODEP model was able to predict dissolved water concentrations and PCB accumulation in the lake sediment within a factor of 2. This shows that the BIODEP model captures the essential processes driving the sink of POPs in high altitude lakes and that POP occurrence in the lake is driven by direct atmospheric inputs with limited influence from the watershed. An important seasonal variability in water column concentrations is predicted which should have important implications in sampling strategies. Furthermore, it is shown that diffusive air-water exchange dominated the PCB dynamics in the lake, especially for the less chlorinated biphenyls. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rooney, N; Kalff, J				Rooney, N; Kalff, J			Inter-annual variation in submerged macrophyte community biomass and distribution: the influence of temperature and lake morphometry	AQUATIC BOTANY												We monitored the biomass and distribution of submerged macrophyte communities in five lakes in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, Canada, in two climatically different growing seasons. Early season warm temperatures allowed for much deeper macrophyte colonization (25-170%), an average of 300 g m(-2) greater wet weight biomass (g m(-2)) and a 45-1160% increase in whole lake biomass in warm 1998 compared to a cooler 1997. In contrast, the inter-year variation in underwater light climate had no effect on macrophyte colonization as water column turbidity was generally higher in the warmer year, although irradiance did affect the distribution and biomass within seasons. The positive relationship between phytoplankton and whole system macrophyte biomass observed in this study cautions that the negative relationship in highly eutrophic shallow systems does not appear applicable to deeper systems characterized by lower macrophyte biomass to lake volume ratios. Earlier growing seasons, as predicted by climate change models, would result in greater biomass and distribution of submerged macrophyte communities, thereby modifying the structure and functioning of north temperate lakes. The effect will be a function of lake morphometry and most pronounced in shallow systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bryant, RG; Rainey, MP				Bryant, RG; Rainey, MP			Investigation of flood inundation on playas within the Zone of Chotts, using a time-series of AVHRR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Our principal objectives were to examine the application of a time-series of advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data to contrast the inundation regimes of a range of large, climatically sensitive playas in the Zone of Chotts regions of southern Tunisia and northeastern Algeria. In doing so, we aimed to: (i) refine methods for monitoring monthly changes in lake areas and seasonal water balance, building from previous studies; (ii) explore the extent to which simple hydrological models can be developed for individual playas; and (iii) compare the hydrologic response of individual playas to seasonal rainfall inputs within North Africa. Here, analyses were conducted using two time-series of AVHRR data (c.2 images per month) for southern Tunisia and northern Algeria (1983-1993 and 1987-1999), with coincident meteorological data. These data were used to detect and monitor inundation events within specific playa catchments in the Zone of Chotts region. Key analyses methods included: (a) the use of reflectance profiles for each time-series to infer inundation processes for each playa and (b) the extraction of lake areas from sequential image data to determine the extent of inundation with an accuracy of between 2% and 6% (depending on lake size). For those playas which were found to inundate as a direct result of precipitation records of lake area change were used to drive simple hydrological models to allowed mean monthly precipitation (P), monthly effective precipitation (P-E), and monthly evaporation (E) to be estimated. The techniques presented here make an important contribution to our understanding of the hydrology of playas in this region. Results for individual playas also suggest that these techniques may be useful in highlighting the dynamic response of these environments to the forcing mechanisms for regional precipitation (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO]). In addition, the findings suggest that more widespread monitoring of playa inundation processes in this manner may impact on our understanding of the precipitation/evaporation status of a number of dryland regions.

S	Potts, R		Ruff, C		Potts, R			Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution	YEARBOOK OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, VOL 41 - 1998	Yearbook of Physical Anthropology											The study of human evolution has long sought to explain major adaptations and trends that led to the origin of Homo sapiens. Environmental scenarios have played a pivotal role in this endeavor. They represent statements or, more commonly, assumptions concerning the adaptive context in which key hominin traits emerged. In many cases, however, these scenarios are based on very little if any data about the past settings in which early hominins lived. Several environmental hypotheses of human evolution are presented in this paper. Explicit test expectations are laid out, and a preliminary assessment of the hypotheses is made by examining the environmental records of Olduvai, Turkana, Olorgesailie, Zhoukoudian, Combe Grenal, and other hominin localities. Habitat-specific hypotheses have prevailed in almost all previous accounts of human adaptive history. The rise of African dry savanna is often cited as the critical event behind the development of terrestrial bipedality, stone toolmaking, and encephalized brains, among other traits. This savanna hypothesis has been countered recently by the woodland/forest hypothesis, which claims that Pliocene hominins had evolved in and were primarily attracted to closed habitats. The ideas that human evolution was fostered by cold habitats in higher latitudes or by seasonal variations in tropical and temperate zones also have their proponents. An alternative view, the variability selection hypothesis, states that large disparities in environmental conditions were responsible for important episodes of adaptive evolution. The resulting adaptations enhanced behavioral versatility and ultimately ecological diversity in the human lineage. Global environmental records for the late Cenozoic and specific records at hominin sites show the following: 1) early human habitats were subject to large-scale remodeling over time; 2) the evidence for environmental instability does not support habitat-specific explanations of key adaptive changes; 3) the range of environmental change over time was more extensive and the tempo far more prolonged than allowed by the seasonality hypothesis; and 4) the variability selection hypothesis is strongly supported by the persistence of hominins through long sequences of environmental remodeling and the origin of important adaptations in periods of wide habitat diversity.

Here, we examined MPs and bacterial compositions in water and sediments of Taihu Lake, China, to reveal the influence of complex MPs on the bacterial community assembly. The results showed that the complexity index of MPs significantly influenced the turnover and nestedness components of bacterial communities. In the colder season, MP complexity was significantly correlated with the turnover componentin sediments (R2 R 2 = 0.19, P < 0.0001), with turnover increasing as MP complexity increased. Conversely, under warmer season, MP complexity was significantly correlated with turnover and nestedness components. Additionally, the interaction effect of environmental and MP factors affected almost all components of beta diversity, particularly in cold water and sediment, with impacts on nestedness of 0.17 and 0.12, respectively, and should thus not be ignored. Our findings indicate for the first time that complex MPs significantly influence the assembly of bacterial communities in lake systems.

Nitrogen availability controls response of microcystin concentration to phosphorus reduction: Evidence from model application to multiple lakes	HARMFUL ALGAE												Microcystis blooms are a global contemporary problem and the mechanisms underlying strain-level ecology (e.g. toxigenic fraction) and toxin (microcystin, MC) production are not sufficiently understood. Recent research suggests that MC synthesis depends on the availability of nitrogen and light, and that they protect toxigenic cells against damage by H2O2. The non-toxigenic strains employ the alternative strategy of enzymatic degradation of H2O2. Thus, MC-producing cells may have an advantage at high nitrogen and light availability. A model based on this mechanism was able to reproduce the observed patterns of toxigenic fraction and MC concentration in Lake Erie. However, it is unclear if this mechanism also applies to other systems. We investigated this by modeling nine different cases (i.e. lakes, stations, years). The model can reproduce observed patterns (toxigenic fraction, concentration of MC, biomass, nutrients and if available H2O2) for all cases, which constitutes support for the proposed mechanism. To explore lake management, we simulated single and dual nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction, which predicts two types of outcomes. For lakes with nitrogen limitation at some time during the blooming season (e.g. Lake Erie) a phosphorus only reduction does not reduce MC concentration proportionally and may even increase it. Reducing phosphorus lowers biomass, which increases nitrogen and light availability and raises MC production and toxigenic fraction. For lakes with replete nitrogen (e.g. Lake Taihu) MC concentration is predicted to decrease. Here, further nitrogen availability will not increase MC production. These results advance mechanistic understanding of Microcystis strain ecology and toxin production and provide guidance for management.

Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) is a crucial component of the water budget and terrestrial material delivery for lakes, but its interplays with intrinsic C-N - N biogeochemical processes remain less tackled. In this study, C and N ingredients and multiple stable isotopes (delta H-2, 2 H, delta O-18, 18 O, delta C-13, 13 C, and delta N-15) 15 N) were measured seasonally in groundwater, river water and lake water of a large eutrophic shallow lake in eastern China. The results revealed that groundwater is enriched with various forms of C and N that have similar sources and pathways as surface water in the lake and rivers. The isotope balance model also indicated that LGD derived C and N contribute significantly to lake inventories in addition to river runoff. These allochthonous C and N provide extra substrates for related biogeochemical processes, such as algae proliferation, organic matter degradation, methanogenesis and denitrification. Simultaneously, the excess oxygen consumption leads to depletion and hypoxia in the lake, further facilitating the processes of methanogenesis and denitrification. LGD functions not only as an external source of C and N that directly increases GHG saturations, but also as a mediator of internal C-N - N pathways, which significantly affect hypoxia formation, GHG productions and emissions in the eutrophic lake. This study highlights the unrevealed potential regulation of LGD on biogeochemical processes in the eutrophic lake, and underscores the need for its consideration in environmental and ecological studies of lakes both regionally and globally.

Drastic change of salinity and pH may have a significant impact on adsorption of microbial extracellular polymers (EPS) to sediment minerals and thus influence many other important elemental geochemical processes. However, how salinity and pH changes affect EPS adsorption to minerals is poorly known. In the present study, adsorption of EPS from a hypersaline microbial mat to goethite at different pH values (4, 7 and 10) and salinity (0.15 parts per thousand, 35 parts per thousand and 70 parts per thousand) was monitored online using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with EEM fluorescence spectroscopy as a complementary method. The adsorption kinetics were well described by an exponential function. The adsorption capacity of EPS to goethite significantly increased as the pH and salinity increased. The pH and salinity dependence of EPS adsorption to goethite is of great importance for understanding the environmental geochemistry of heavy metals in aquatic environments. In inland lakes and estuary zones, the seasonal or daily pulse of hydrological events will drastically alter water salinity and pH and consequently exert significant influences on the mobility, chemical species and ecotoxicity of heavy metals through the EPS pathway. It is necessary to systematically investigate the geochemical behavior of EPS in such dynamic aquatic environments and their potential effects on other geochemical processes.					; Zhang, Daoyong/I-1036-2013; El-Serehy, Hamed/GVT-7938-2022; pan, xiangliang/I-1466-2014; Gadd, Geoffrey/AAS-6971-2021; Mortuza, M Golam/GXA-0098-2022	Mortuza, M.

Fragment viability and rootlet formation in Eurasian watermilfoil after desiccation	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Eurasian watermilfoil often invades aquatic ecosystems in North America via fragment transport from infested lakes to uninfested water bodies by watercraft and boat trailers. While fragments transported on watercraft and trailers are likely introduced to new water bodies in various stages of desiccation, surprisingly little is known about the desiccation tolerance and subsequent viability of Eurasian watermilfoil. We conducted in situ and laboratory experiments during the 2010 growing season to examine (1) the rate at which Eurasian watermilfoil desiccates, (2) the likelihood of new growth and rootlet formation in control fragments and fragments that had been desiccated for 3, 6, 18, 24, and 48 h, and (3) time until new growth and rootlet formation in the different treatment groups. We found that desiccation over time fits a Michaelis-Menten type function on which 87% and 96% desiccation occurred after just 3 and 6 h, respectively, and 100% desiccation of milfoil fragments occurred at approximately 13 h under laboratory conditions. Based on a logistic regression model, desiccation significantly reduced the likelihood of fragment viability from 98% in control fragments to 2% in fragments that were completely (100%) desiccated in the laboratory experiment. Desiccation also increased the time until new growth and rootlet formation. In control treatments, 20% of Eurasian watermilfoil nodes produced new growth (via lateral bud growth) after 5 weeks, and 90% of those produced rootlets. Although desiccation significantly reduced Eurasian watermilfoil fragment viability, a small proportion (2%) of fragments that were 100% dried were still viable and able to form rootlets.																			0146-6623					JUL	2011	49						57	U78																WOS:000209043500001

Microbial biosynthesis of wax esters during desiccation: Adaptation for colonization of the earliest terrestrial environments?	GEOLOGY												Intense fluctuations in precipitation govern seasonal cycles of ephemeral lakes, controlling hydration stresses and producing changes in the biochemical composition of endemic microbes. The lipid compositions of emergent and desiccated mats with comparable microbial communities from evaporative alkaline lakes reveal increases in the abundance and average chain length of wax esters (WE) that may represent an evolutionary strategy to survive desiccation in evaporative environments. Subsequent rehydration naturally saponifies WE, regenerating alcohol and acid moieties that can be utilized as membrane lipids for the next viable microbial generation. The antiquity of this biosynthetic innovation suggests that WE production likely facilitated microbial migration to lake environments in the earliest terrestrial ecosystems as well as their survival through hydration-dehydration cycles.					; Brassell, SImon/H-4970-2011	/0000-0002-9787-1675; Brassell, Simon/0000-0001-8200-2488													0091-7613					MAR	2010	38	3					247	250		10.1130/G30398.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G30398.1													WOS:000275071400014

Seasonal variations of species composition and abundance of zooplankton in Ehoma Lake, a floodplain lake in Nigeria	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Ehoma Lake is among the important breeding sites of the major fishes in the Mid-Cross River, Nigeria. The juveniles of these fishes are solely dependent on zooplankton, which has not been studied previously. I studied monthly the lake's physico-chemical variables and zooplankton composition in three stations (littoral, sub-littoral and pelagic) from March 2005 to August 2006. Sixty-seven zooplankton species (42 rotifers, 19 cladocerans and 6 copepods) were identified. Daphnia obtusa Kurz. Keratella valga Ehrenberg, Keratella ticinensis Callerrio, Keratella hiemalis Carlin, Brachionus dimidiatus Bryce and Lecane candida Hauer and Murray are new records for Nigeria The dominant zooplankters were Diaphanosoma excisum Kurz and Moina micrura Kurz. There was an inverse relationship between species richness and abundance. Richness was highest in the dry season while peak zooplankton abundance was recorded in the rainy season. Zooplankton abundance and species richness decreased progressively from the littoral to the pelagic station while the Shannon-Weaver diversity index varied from 0.68 to 1.28 without a clear seasonal trend. There is a succession pattern: rotifers that are dominant in the dry season are replaced by cladocerans in the rainy season. This succession was greatly influenced by seasonal flooding of the lake. As no previous information on the zooplankton of the lake is available, this study provides baseline data on the lake's zooplankton. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (1): 171-182.

Seasonal and spatial variations of levels and toxicity suggested higher individual carcinogenic PAH concentrations and toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) in the flooding season. Three-way PAHs dataset (PAH species, spatial variability, and seasonal variability) was analyzed by PMF3, and its results were compared with a widely used 2-way model (PMF2). Consistent results were observed: vehicular emission was the most important contributor (67.08% by PMF2 and 61.83% by PMF3 for the flooding season; 54.21% by PMF2 and 52.94% by PMF3 for dry season), followed by coal combustion and wood combustion in both seasons. The PMF-cluster analysis was employed to investigate spatial variability of source contributions. Findings can introduce the 3-way approach to apportion sources of PAHs and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in sediments, offering the advantage of accounting for information on 3-way datasets.

Rama			Assessment of heavy metal pollution in lake sediments of Katedan Industrial Development Area, Hyderabad, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Spatial distribution and temporal trends studies were carried out at Katedan Industrial Development Area (KIDA) near Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state, India under Indo-Norwegian Institutional Cooperation Program, to find out the extent of contamination in streams and lake sediments from the discharge of industrial effluents. Stream and lake sediment samples were collected from the five lakes in the study area and connecting water streams. The samples were analyzed by XRF spectrometer for toxic elements. The studies reveal that the stream sediments with in the KIDA and the impounded Noor Mohammed Lake down stream have high concentration of some of the toxic elements like chromium, nickel, lead, arsenic, zinc etc. The geology of the area indicates that the study area consists of residual soil of acidic rocks, which are predominantly of Archaean gneisses and granites having low to medium concentrations of chromium and nickel. The source of these high concentration of elements like lead 2,300 mg/kg, copper 1,500 mg/kg, arsenic 500 mg/kg, chromium 500 mg/kg etc. cannot be derived from the surrounding acidic rocks and may be attributed to the industrial effluents released in the ditches and random dumping of hazardous solid waste. It was observed that the metal concentrations increased in the streams during the dry season (pre-monsoon period). After the monsoon rains, the metal concentrations in the streams were reduced by half which may be due to dilution. The eroded sediments are deposited in the lake where very high concentrations were encountered. Overflowing of the lake will spread the contamination further downstream. The lake sediments will remain as a major source of contamination by desorption to the water phase regardless of what happens to the effluent discharge in the KIDA. However, some samples showed enrichment of lead, arsenic and nickel during post-monsoon, which were collected near the dumpsite due to the leaching of toxic elements from the dump site to the lakes. Some of the toxic elements like nickel and copper have not shown any dilution but have increased after the rains, which could be due to the leaching of arsenic from the dumpsite to the lake along with rainwater. Geochemical maps showing the distribution of heavy/trace elements in streams and lakes are prepared and presented in this paper. Effect of toxic elements on the health of the residents in the surrounding residential areas is also discussed.

J	Xu, J; Zhang, M; Xie, P				Xu, Jun; Zhang, Min; Xie, Ping			Stable carbon isotope variations in surface bloom scum and subsurface seston among shallow eutrophic lakes	HARMFUL ALGAE												Carbon stable isotope analysis of surface bloom scum and subsurface seston samples was conducted in shallow eutrophic lakes in China during warm seasons from 2003 to 2004. delta C-13 values of bloom scum were always higher (averaged 5 parts per thousand) than those of seston in this study, and the possible reasons were attributed to (i) direct use of atmospheric CO2 at the air-water interface, (ii) decrease in C-13 fractionation due to higher carbon fixation, (iii) active CO2 transport, and/or (iv) HCO3 accumulation. Negative correlation between delta C-13(scum) - delta C-13(seston) and pH in the test lakes indicated that phytoplankton at the subsurface water column increased isotopic enrichment under the-carbon limitation along with the increase of pH, which might in turn decreased the differences in 313 C between the subsurface seston and the surface scums. Significant positive correlations of seston 8 13C with total concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in water column suggested that the increase in delta C-13 of seston with trophic state was depending on nutrient (N or P, or both) supply. Our study showed that delta C-13 of phytoplankton was indicative of carbon utilization, primary productivity, and nutrient supply among the eutrophic lakes.

J	Kohn, MJ; Miselis, JL; Fremd, TJ				Kohn, MJ; Miselis, JL; Fremd, TJ			Oxygen isotope evidence for progressive uplift of the Cascade Range, Oregon	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Oxygen isotope compositions of fossil equid teeth in the Cascade rainshadow reveal a similar to5parts per thousand decrease in mean delta(18)O since 27 Ma. Isotopic changes are inconsistent with expected effects from global climate change because: (a) the expected isotopic shift to tooth delta(18)O values due to global climate change (similar to1parts per thousand) is much smaller than the observed shift, (b) predicted and observed isotopic trends are opposite for Oligocene vs. Miocene samples, and (c) average compositions and ranges in compositions remained unchanged for samples from before and after major global cooling in the mid-Miocene. Accounting for a decrease in relative humidity of at least 15%, we infer a topographically driven secular shift in the delta(18)O value of rainwater of 6-8parts per thousand since the late Oligocene, which is approximately equivalent to the modem-day difference in delta(18)O values of precipitation and surface waters across the central Cascades. Rise of the central Cascades apparently occurred monotonically over the last 27 Ma, with a hiatus between similar to15.4 and 7.2 Ma, possibly related to eruption of the Columbia River Basalts. Progressive volcanic accumulation over tens of millions of years best explains the data, rather than a short-lived uplift event. Paleoseasonality, as inferred from isotope zoning and intertooth variability, decreased dramatically from 7-9parts per thousand at 15.4-7 Ma to similar to3parts per thousand at 3 Ma, then increased to 6-8parts per thousand today. The cause of the decrease in seasonality at 3 Ma may reflect either brief warming during the mid-Pliocene within the context of global tectonic reorganization, or consumption by equids of water from an isotopically buffered Lake Idaho.

Effect of water quality and season on the population dynamics of Cabomba caroliniana in subtropical Queensland, Australia	AQUATIC BOTANY												Cabomba caroliniana is a submersed aquatic macrophyte that originates from the Americas and is currently invading temperate, subtropical, and tropical freshwater habitats around the world. Despite being a nuisance in many countries, little is known about its ecology. We monitored C. caroliniana populations in three reservoirs in subtropical Queensland, Australia, over 5.5 years. Although biomass, stem length, and plant density of the C caroliniana stands fluctuated over time, they did not exhibit clear seasonal patterns. Water depth was the most important environmental factor explaining C caroliniana abundance. Plant biomass was greatest at depths from 2-4 m and rooted plants were not found beyond 5 m. Plant density was greatest in shallow water and decreased with depth, most likely as a function of decreasing light and increasing physical stress. We tested the effect of a range of water physico-chemical parameters. The concentration of phosphorus in the water column was the variable that explained most of the variation in C caroliniana population parameters. We found that in subtropical Australia, C caroliniana abundance does not appear to be affected by seasonal conditions but is influenced by other environmental variables such as water depth and nutrient loading. Therefore, further spread will more likely be governed by local habitat rather than climatic conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelled and satellite-derived surface albedo of lake ice - Part I: evaluation of the albedo parameterization scheme of the Canadian Lake Ice Model	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 04-06, 2013	Huntsville, CANADA					Accurate simulations of freshwater lake ice are integral for the study of climatic variability in northern environments. Surface albedo, a component often parameterized in lake ice models, has been shown to affect the timing of ice break-up during the melt season. In situ snow and ice albedo measurements were taken over a partially snow-covered freshwater lake near Churchill, Manitoba for the evaluation of the albedo parameterization of the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) albedo products (MOD10A1/MYD10A1 and MCD43A3). The albedo simulations using CLIMo were performed with and without snow integrated into the model and evaluated against in situ albedo measurements recorded over clear ice, snow ice and snow-covered ice. The simulated snow albedo from CLIMo for the entire ice growth season evaluated against snow albedo observations had a root mean square error of 0.07, a mean absolute error of 0.06, and a mean bias error (MBE) of -0.01. With snow removed from CLIMo, the albedo parameterization overestimated albedo values measured in the field over snow-free clear ice and snow ice with MBE values of 0.13 and 0.10, respectively. These findings suggest that CLIMo's bare ice albedo parameterization needs to be revised to account for albedo differences between ice types. The evaluation of the MODIS albedo products with in situ snow and ice albedo observations and the comparison of these satellite products with CLIMo's albedo parameterization during the melt period, when in situ radiation measurement stations needed to be removed from the lake-ice surface, are addressed in paper Part II (this issue).

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study of trace metal (TM) contamination was conducted at Lake Tonga (Algeria), a site surrounded by several indirect contamination point sources such as an abandoned mine and steelworks. Studying two sampling sites over four seasons, we were able to depict the spatial and temporal variability of TM contamination in the lake. Among the seven TM examined (Pb, Cd, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu, and Cr), only Fe, Pb, and Cd showed concentrations significantly higher than the site's geological background. The contamination index (sediment concentration/background concentration) calculated for these three TM (Cd = 1.9 +/- 1.6, Fe = 6.8 +/- 1.8, and Pb = 3.3 +/- 2.6) clearly indicated anthropogenic contamination. Sediment TM contamination differed both between sampling sites and seasons despite environmental variables (e.g., oxygen and pH) being similar, thus suggesting different TM contamination sources. Fe contamination was high at the two sampling sites and over all studied seasons, possibly indicating general lake-scale Fe contamination, probably related to atmospheric deposition of steelworks emissions both on the lake and within the watershed. Lake tributaries were further suspected of channeling Fe contamination from the watershed into the lake. On the other hand, the sampling site close to the outlet was especially rich in Cd and Pb typically reflecting contamination by mine wastes. The indirect connection between the abandoned mine and the lake indicates that runoff of mine leachates through groundwater was likely a candidate in explaining the specificity of the TM contamination in this part of the lake. This study provides insights for management of TM contamination by addressing both spatial and temporal variability within the lake as well as differences in contamination sources.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2013	185	12					9905	9915		10.1007/s10661-013-3300-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3300-6								23793646					WOS:000326397900019

Water scarcity often exacerbates the impact of pollution, because harmful compounds can reach very high concentration values in the presence of relatively low water volumes. Among self-cleansing (depollution) processes of water bodies, photochemical reactions are expected to play an important role in pollutant attenuation, although sometimes they yield harmful intermediates. In this work, the effects of water-level fluctuations on photochemical reactions were studied by means of a modelling approach. The model applies to well-mixed water bodies, such as the shallow ones that are more likely to undergo fluctuations of the water level. We investigated how water outflow and evaporation (as well as a mixed scenario) might modify the steady-state concentrations of the most important photoreactive transients ((OH)-O-center dot, CO3-center dot, O-1(2) and triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter, (CDOM)-C-3*). Under the same conditions, the possible phototransformation of emerging pollutants such as carbamazepine, ibuprofen, 2,4-dichloro-6-nitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol was also assessed. It is shown that water loss would generally enhance photochemical reactions, but to a variable extent depending on the actual pathway. Outflow would favour all photoprocesses, and particularly those involving (OH)-O-center dot and CO3-center dot. Conversely, evaporation would enhance reaction with O-1(2) and (CDOM)-C-3* while having practically no effect on (OH)-O-center dot, CO3-center dot and direct photolysis. Enhancement of photochemical self-cleansing of water bodies would partially reduce the pollution impact, but in some cases harmful compounds may be generated.

J	Babel, M				Babel, M			Models for evaporite, selenite and gypsum microbialite deposition in ancient saline basins	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												A group of integrated hydrological and sedimentary qualitative models is introduced for evaporite and selenite (coarse-crystalline gypsum) deposition in ancient drawdown saline basins (salinas). The general model of a salina basin as a framework for intrabasinal models of selenite and gypsum microbialite ( a variety of fine-grained gypsum) sedimentation is given. Selected aspects of evaporite, selenite and gypsum microbialite deposition are reviewed and discussed. A salina basin is a depression supplied with marine water by seepage and occasional surface inflows. The intrabasinal environments comprise: (i) ephemeral saline pans, evaporite shoals, and the peculiar majanna environment ( recognised in the Recent MacLeod salina, Australia); and (ii) perennial saline pans. The sedimentary dynamic of these environments is controlled largely by seasonal brine level and groundwater table level fluctuations. The perennial saline pans are characterised by three basic hydrological states: (i) meromixis-with a permanent pycnocline, (ii) monomixis to polymixis-with a seasonal or periodic pycnocline, and (iii) polymixis-without a constant pycnocline. Monomictic saline pans showing stratification in the wet period ( during seasonal highstand) and mixis in the dry period of the year ( during seasonal lowstand) are the most significant for subaqueous evaporite and selenite deposition. Evaporite deposition takes place mainly during a mixis period coinciding with a dry season lowstand and increased evaporation. Within intrabasinal environments selenite crusts can be occasionally deposited from permanent brine sheets on evaporite shoals or majanna flats, but are mainly the product of bottom crystallisation in the hypolimnion of the monomictic (and/or polymictic) saline pans. Shallow-brine and deep-brine selenite pans are distinguished from each other on the basis of the relationship of the seasonally fluctuating pycnocline to the bottom of the pan. Selenite deposition in the mixolimnion of a deep meromictic basin is also possible. The qualitative models can be used for sedimentological analyses of ancient selenite-evaporite basins.																			0001-5709	2300-1887					2004	54	2					219	U6																WOS:000227824300002

Our aim was to assess the seasonal and concentration relationships between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DON, and NO(3)(-) within 102 streams and 16 lakes within catchments of differing complexity situated in Wales. Further, we aimed to assess whether patterns of land use, soil type, and vegetation gave consistent trends in DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) relationships over a diverse range of catchments. Our results reinforce that DON constitutes a significant component of the total dissolved N pool typically representing 40 to 50% of the total N in streams and lakes but sometimes representing greater than 85% of the total dissolved N. Generally, the levels of DON were inversely correlated with the concentration of DIN. In contrast to DIN concentrations, which showed distinct seasonality, DON showed no consistent seasonal trend. We hypothesize that this reflects differences in the bioavailability of these two N types. The amount of DON, DOC, and DIN was significantly related to soil type with higher DON export from Histosol-dominated catchments in comparison with Spodosol-dominated watersheds. Vegetation cover also had a significant effect on DON concentrations independent of soil type with a nearly twofold decrease in DON export from forested catchments in comparison with nonforested watersheds. Due to the diversity in catchment DON behavior, we speculate that this will limit the adoption of DON as a broad-scale indicator of catchment condition for use in monitoring and assessment programs.					jones, davey/C-7411-2011; Ormerod, Steve/A-4326-2010; Ormerod, Stephen J/A-4326-2010	Ormerod, Stephen J/0000-0002-8174-302X													0047-2425					JAN-FEB	2004	33	1					201	209		10.2134/jeq2004.0201	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.0201								14964375					WOS:000188497100023
J	Bigler, C; Hall, RI				Bigler, C; Hall, RI			Diatoms as indicators of climatic and limnological change in Swedish Lapland: a 100-lake calibration set and its validation for paleoecological reconstructions	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study investigated the distribution of subfossil diatom assemblages in surficial sediments of 100 lakes along steep ecological and climatic gradients in northernmost Sweden (Abisko region, 67.07degrees N to 68.48degrees N latitude, 17.67degrees E to 23.52degrees E longitude) to develop and cross-validate transfer functions for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Of 19 environmental variables determined for each site, 15 were included in the statistical analysis. Lake-water pH (8.0%), sedimentary loss-on-ignition (LOI, 5.9%) and estimated mean July air temperature (July T, 4.8%) explained the greatest amounts of variation in the distribution of diatom taxa among the 100 lakes. Temperature and pH optima and tolerances were calculated for abundant taxa. Transfer functions, based on WA-PLS (weighted averaging partial least squares), were developed for pH (r(2) = 0.77, root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.19 pH units, maximum bias = 0.31, as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation) based on 99 lakes and for July T (r(2) = 0.75, RMSEP = 0.96 degreesC, max. bias = 1.37 degreesC) based on the full 100 lake set. We subsequently assessed the ability of the diatom transfer functions to estimate lake-water pH and July T using a form of independent cross-validation. To do this, the 100-lake set was divided in two subsets. An 85-lake training-set (based on single limnological measurements) was used to develop transfer functions with similar performance as those based on the full 100 lakes, and a 15-lake test-set (with 2 years of monthly limnological measurements throughout the ice-free seasons) was used to test the transfer functions developed from the 85-lake training-set. Results from the intra-set cross-validation exercise demonstrated that lake-specific prediction errors (RMSEP) for the 15-lake test-set corresponded closely with the median measured values (pH) and the estimations based on spatial interpolations of data from weather stations (July T). The prediction errors associated with diatom inferences were usually within the range of seasonal and interannual variability. Overall, our results confirm that diatoms can provide reliable and robust estimates of lake-water pH and July T, that WA-PLS is a robust calibration method and that long-term environmental data are needed for further improvement of paleolimnological transfer functions.					; Bigler, Christian/C-4002-2008; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2002	27	1					97	115		10.1023/A:1013562325326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013562325326													WOS:000173086500008

In order to evaluate limitation of different phytoplankton groups by inorganic nutrients, multiple nutrient enrichment bioassays using the addition of iron (Fe) and the combined addition of nitrogen and phosphorus (NP) were carried out in the north and the south of Lake Tanganyika during the rainy and dry seasons in 2003 and 2004. 2. Nutrient additions resulted in an increase in phytoplankton growth rate relative to control treatments in all experiments. HPLC pigment data and epifluorescence microscopy counts indicated differential stimulation of the dominant phytoplankton groups. Iron additions mainly stimulated prokaryotic picophytoplankton, while enrichments with nitrogen and phosphorus stimulated green algae and in some cases diatoms. Extended incubation (3 days) indicated co-limitation of Fe and NP, in particular for picocyanobacteria.					; Alleman, Laurent/T-2038-2019; De Wever, Aaike/A-4691-2009	De Wever, Aaike/0000-0001-8804-8321; Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063; Andre, Luc/0000-0002-7286-0072; Alleman, Laurent/0000-0003-4165-1742; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800													0046-5070					FEB	2008	53	2					264	277		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01890.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01890.x													WOS:000252393800005

All available days from 5 April through 20 September 1999 were evaluated using 0.5degrees base reflectivity and accumulated precipitation products from the national radar network and the day-1 (0-24 h) and day-2 (24-48 h) forecasts from a quasi-operational version of the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5). Contingency measures show forecast skill for convective occurrence is high, with day-1 (day 2) equitable threat scores and Kuipers skill scores (KSS) of 0.69 (0.60) and 0.84 (0.75), respectively. Forecast skill in predicting convective mode (defined as linear, multicellular, or isolated) is also high, with KSS of 0.91 (0.86) for day 1 (day 2). Median timing errors for convective initiation/dissipation were within 2.5 h for all modes of convection at both forecast ranges. Forecasts of the areal coverage of the 24-h accumulated precipitation in convective events exhibited skill comparable to the lower-resolution, operational models, with median threat scores at day 1 (day 2) of 0.21 (0.24). When small displacements (less than 85 km) in the precipitation pattern were taken into account, threat scores increased to as high as 0.44 for the most organized convective modes. The implications of these results for the use of mesoscale models in operational forecasting are discussed.																			0882-8156					OCT	2003	18	5					782	794		10.1175/1520-0434(2003)018<0782:SHNPOC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(2003)018<0782:SHNPOC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185707400007

The goal was to assess (a) the spatial distribution of airborne microbes across Sistan to identify hotspots of high levels, (b) airborne microbe concentrations in urban and non-urban environments, and (c) the influence of Hamoun lakes on airborne microbial concentrations. The highest bacterial and fungal concentrations per gram of dust were observed in Zabol (3.5 x 10(6) and 1.2 x10(4) cfu g(- 1)) and the lowest in Ghorghori (1.16 x10(4) and 1.1 x10(3 )cfu g- 1). The highest bacterial and fungal concentrations per sampled area were found in Aliakbar (4.7 x10(7) and 8.6 x10(4 )cfu g(- 1)) and the lowest in Ghorghori (1.9x10(7 )and 3.2 x10(4) cfu g(- 1)). Aliakbar and Zahak were the most serious airborne microbial hazard sites based on high loads of dust and, consequently, microbes. Hamoun lakes contribute to airborne microbial pollution across Sistan. Management of lakes is suggested as a key path forward to reduce dispersal of microbes.

The experimental conditions are known, from previous work on these systems, to cause a dramatic collapse of the dominant algal or cyanobacterial species, which in turn can be associated with viral activity. Within 2 weeks of continuous addition of nutrient-rich growth medium, near-complete collapse of the dominant population occurred over the span of a few days. The collapse was repeatedly and reproducibly observed and was primarily characterized by a marked increase in water transparency. Scattering of light decreased by similar to 80%, absorption decreased by 20-80%. There was high similarity in optical changes between several experiments, carried out in different seasons. An increase of dissolved material and submicron-sized particles (SMP) that showed chlorophyll a (Chl a) absorption was observed during the collapse. The phycocyanin (PC): Chl a ratio and phaeopigment : Chl a ratio proved to be good indicators of the observed collapse. Reflectance spectra that were modelled using a constant volume-scattering function indicated that mass mortality of this magnitude can be detected in natural systems using current remote sensors.

A combination of diatom and geochemical analyses of the recently deposited sediments of Odensj & ouml;n, a small dimictic lake in southern Sweden, shows alternating light and dark laminae composed of greater amounts of biogenic silica and organic matter, respectively. As confirmed by independent radiometric dating and Pb pollution data, and supported by scanning electron microscopy of individual laminae, these features represent ongoing deposition of biogenic varves. Corresponding diatom and geochemical data obtained from a 92-cm long freeze core provide evidence of substantial lake-ecosystem dynamics during the last six centuries, related mainly to variations in light penetration and wind shear driven by human-induced changes in catchment vegetation. The diatom assemblage of Odensjon's varved sediments is dominated by planktonic species, primarily Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria saxoplanktonica and Discostella lacuskarluki during periods of forest cover, while increased catchment openness from the mid-1500s to the late 1800s led to increased abundance of Lindavia comensis. Long-term variations in climate and land use, mediated through changing length of the ice-cover season and nutrient input, respectively, probably contributed to the observed trends, as well as to variations in the appearance and visibility of the varve record across the sampled sediment sequence. Odensj & ouml;n represents the southernmost varved sediment record in Fennoscandia documented to date, offering potential to study the effects of various types of external forcing on its sensitive lacustrine ecosystem since the Late Weichselian deglaciation. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of assessing the local impacts of two major, historically documented volcanic events, Laki 1783-84 and Tambora 1815, which are known to have affected European societies. Although the mildly alkaline waters of the lake are well buffered and hence relatively resilient to volcanic acid deposition, a minor response to the Laki eruption may be recorded in the diatom stratigraphy.

Therefore, DOM is the research basis for understanding the meaning of the water environment and the laws of the migration and transformation of pollutants. Qinghai Lake is one of the world's typical inland plateau lake wetlands. It plays important roles in improving and regulating the climate and in promoting a virtuous regional ecological cycle. In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the rapid development of tourism, under the background of climate change, and with grassland degradation and precipitation change, the whole basin of Qinghai Lake has been facing great ecological pressure. In order to comprehensively explore the water environment of Qinghai Lake and to protect the sustainable development of the basin, a systematic study was carried out on the whole basin of Qinghai Lake. The results show the following: (1) from 2010 to 2020, the annual average value of CODCr in Qinghai Lake fluctuated in the range from class III to class V according to the surface water environmental quality standard, showing first a downward trend and then an upward trend. (2) The concentration of CDOM in Qinghai Lake had obvious temporal and spatial changes. (3) The spatial distribution of the total fluorescence intensity of FDOM in water was also different in different seasons.

This study seeks to develop a discretization of dry and wet spells on a monthly scale while evaluating the risk of extremes using the renewal wet-dry spell model. This model consists of defining the wet spell according a negligible precipitation threshold. The structure of the model is that all parameters of the climate cycle, including its length, are random variables. To study the trend of the parameters we use the Mann-Kendall test, while the magnitude is evaluated by the Sen's estimation method. The approach is applied to Ichkeul Lake basin in northern Tunisia to demonstrate its capacity. This region is of great agricultural and water importance, although it holds six large dams. The results show that the duration of the dry and wet spells reach's, respectively, 49 days and 17 days. The maximum dry spell was 49 days in 1982. The Mann-Kendall test revealed three stations with significant positive trend of the monthly extreme dry spell length (at March) located in south and east of the basin. The trend analysis of the seasonal rainfall number showed one station with significant negative trend in east and one station with significant negative trend in the center of the basin. Results indicated that no significant changes in the start and end of rainy season have occurred over the past years. But a great relation with a subsequent length exists. The results of this research assist farmers and managers in establishing drought management plans. It allow, among other things, to calibrate simulation models for a more realistic management of water reservoirs. It also makes it possible to plan irrigations on a more different basis from that of observations made at regular time intervals.																			2523-3963	2523-3971				DEC	2021	3	12							850	10.1007/s42452-021-04834-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-021-04834-8													WOS:000714022500001
J	Priyaa, SS; Jena, BK				Priyaa, S. Shanmuga; Jena, Basanta Kumar			Suspended sediments concentration on shoreline change using satellite images for southern Kerala coast	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Shoreline is a dynamic system where erosion/accretion patterns and sea-level rise takes place due to the natural marine processes and anthropogenic activities. The movement of suspended sediment along the coastal water is an indicator of erosion and deposition of the coastal landforms. This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes and the corresponding spatio-temporal pattern of suspended sediment concentration of the southern Kerala coast using Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0-10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.85 with the field data. Similarly, the shoreline erosion and accretion have been analysed from the shoreline change analysis methods. In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast. It is inferred that, with the use of satellite images, the relation between the erosion/accretion pattern and the suspended sediment pattern along the coast can be visualised and qualitatively studied.

K.; Burgmann, Roland			Seasonal Seismicity in the Lake Biwa Region of Central Japan Moderately Modulated by Lake Water Storage Changes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Seasonal seismicity in Japan has been observed and attributed to variations induced by hydrological loading, as well as atmospheric and pore-fluid pressure. We examine the seasonal variations of crustal (<15 km depth) and low magnitude (M < 4.5) earthquakes in central Japan near the Biwako-Seigan Fault Zone (BSFZ), and analyze their correlation with the annual hydrological cycle of nearby Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan. The 2002-2018 lake water storage is estimated using water-level gauge and satellite altimetry data. Regional surface mass loading from soil moisture and snow predicted by the Global Land Data Assimilation System is used to augment the lake mass variation. We compute the stress and stressing-rate changes induced by the surface mass loading from lake storage, snow, and soil moisture at seismogenic depth (10 km) along the BSFZ using a finite element model incorporating a 3D Earth structure. The results show that seasonal surface mass loading generates 1-5 kPa peak-to-peak Coulomb stress change and 2.5-15 kPa/year stressing-rate variations on the fault segments along the BSFZ. Two of the four fault segments present significant correlation between local seismicity rate and loading-derived stress and/or stressing rate changes. Among the hydrological load components, lake water, snow, and soil moisture exhibit different annual phases, and the lake water storage dominates the total annual stress changes. Our analysis indicates that seasonal surface hydrological loads, especially lake water variations, modulate the seismicity rate along the BSFZ in central Japan. Plain Language Summary The mass changes of water and snow on Earth's surface could be one of the explanations for observed seasonal variations in seismicity in Japan. We modeled this seasonal hydrological loading induced stress changes in the Biwa Lake region and fault segments of the Biwak-Seigan Fault zone in central Japan. We calculate the seasonal stress change and stressing rate from different hydrological components, including lake water, soil moisture, and snow. We find the hydrological load induced stressing rate can be as large as 15 kPa/year, and it exhibits a good correlation with seismicity rate for two fault segments in the Biwako-Seigan Fault Zone (BSFZ). Furthermore, the geometry of faults also plays an important role on phase and magnitude of surface load induced stress changes. Among the hydrological load components, lake water, snow, and soil moisture exhibit different annual phases, and the lake water storage dominates the total annual stress changes. Our results indicate that seasonal hydrological loads could modulate the stress state and seismicity rate in BSFZ of central Japan.					; Burgmann, Roland/AAE-5138-2022	Fu, Yuning/0000-0002-9226-3857; Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; Burgmann, Roland/0000-0002-3560-044X; Xue, Liang/0000-0002-7071-1057; Johnson, Christopher/0000-0002-2589-7593													2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JB023301	10.1029/2021JB023301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB023301													WOS:000751383000079

Interferometric decorrelation due to season replacement limits the conventional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique and its application in such areas. To extend the monitoring capability in the salt desert area, we select a vast basin of saline soil around Howz-e-Soltan Salt Lake of Iran as the study area and present an improved MT-InSAR for experimental research. Based on 131 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between October 2014 to July 2020,1896 refined interferograms in total are selected from all interfero-gram candidates. Interferometric coherence analysis shows that the coherence in the saline soil area has an apparent seasonal variation, and the soil moisture affected by the precipitation may be the main factor that leads to the seasonal variation. Subsequently, the deformation characteristics of saline soil under different environmental conditions and human activity factors are compared and analyzed in detail. Related deformation mechanisms of different saline soil types are initially revealed by combining interferometric coherence, meteorological data, and engineering geological characteristics of saline soil. Related results would provide reference for the large-scale infrastructure construction engineering in similar saline soil areas.

Changes in Wetland Vegetation in Regulated Lakes in Northern Minnesota, USA Ten Years after a New Regulation Plan Was Implemented	WETLANDS												Lake-level regulation alters wetland plant communities and their role in providing faunal habitat. Regulation plans have sometimes been changed to restore ecosystem function; however, few studies have shown the effects of such changes. In 2000, a new plan was implemented for regulation of Rainy Lake and Namakan Reservoir in northern Minnesota, USA. We had studied wetland plant communities under the previous 1970 regulation plan in 1987 and used those data to evaluate changes during 2002-2006 and 2010 resampling efforts using the same methods. Ordinations showed that plant communities changed little on Rainy Lake, where regulation changes were minor. However, on Namakan Reservoir, substantial changes had occurred in both vegetation and faunal habitat within two years, as plants favored by dewatering were replaced by submersed aquatic plants favored by year-round flooding under the new 2000 regulation plan. After ten years, Namakan showed greater similarity to unregulated Lac La Croix but still differed overall. Longer-term studies may be needed to determine if the regulation-plan change continues to alter Namakan plant communities. The speed at which changes began suggests that studies on other regulated lakes should begin in the first growing season following implementation of a new regulation plan and should continue periodically for a decade or longer.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2018	38	3					437	449		10.1007/s13157-017-0986-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-017-0986-1													WOS:000437409800003

In some instances, a combination of both constructed wetlands and lakes are designed to further improve the efficiency of the system. The main aim of this paper is to compare the water quality between two urban stormwater lakes. A standalone lake system and a combined wetland/lake system were monitored for water quality. The results indicate that an integrated wetland and urban lake performs better than the urban lake alone. The improved performance was particularly significant in terms of physical parameters such as turbidity, suspended solids, total solids (TS) and nutrients (particularly nitrogen). The significance of the wetland in the integrated system is highlighted as it helped, on an average, to reduce the concentration of TS, ammonium and phosphate by 50%, 62% and 53%, respectively.					; Maheshwari, Basant/AAG-8881-2020; Hagare, Dharma/K-2614-2019	Hagare, Dharmappa/0000-0003-0577-6353; 													1606-9749					JUN	2018	18	3					956	967		10.2166/ws.2017.169	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2017.169													WOS:000437347600020

Here we explore whether analyses of these remains isolated from lake flotsam can provide information on the driving variables affecting the isotopic composition of these remains. We collected flotsam in 53 lakes and found enough material in 33 lakes to measure the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (expressed as delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, respectively) of resting stages. These values were compared with lake characteristics, water chemistry measurements, and the isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in the lakes. Mean delta C-13 values of cladoceran ephippia and SOM were correlated and both were also negatively correlated with deep water methane concentrations and indicators of lake stratification. This supports the findings of previous studies that methane-derived carbon can provide a significant proportion of carbon entering planktonic food webs. Mean delta N-15 values of bryozoan statoblasts and SOM were correlated, suggesting that both reflect the delta N-15 values of phytoplankton. Our results provide information on how environmental variables in lakes can influence the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in resting stages, but flotsam samples can also potentially be used to assess seasonal stable isotope variability of resting stages. Both types of information are important to improve palaeoenvironmental interpretations of stable isotope records based on these remains in lake sediments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This has resulted in increased pressure on surface water supplies, human consumption and socioeconomic growth. Although water management requires monitoring, a substantial amount of water consumption globally, including both groundwater and surface water, remains unmeasured. Madhya Pradesh (MP) has a very varied semi-arid geographical region in Central India. Recent studies have found that 36 out of 51 districts in the state of MP have been facing severe hydrological drought conditions. Despite the challenges in the MP region, there is little understanding of the permanent and seasonal changes in surface water and the overall availability of surface water resources in each district. Field-based monitoring of surface water bodies in large regions such as MP poses considerable difficulties. However, gaining knowledge about changes in the distribution of water on the Earth's surface across time and space can be enhanced by analysing data obtained via remote sensing. To understand the long-term changes in surface water in different districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, over the past 38 years, we analysed a publicly accessible global surface water dataset provided by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) European Commission. This dataset is based on Landsat imagery and covers the period from 1984 to 2021. This research study examines the associations between variations in the permanent surface water level and the extent of land being irrigated, the intensity of agricultural activities and the seasonal oscillations in surface water for several districts in Madhya Pradesh. The findings from this research will be beneficial for assessing several significant MP districts in terms of their water footprint and sustainable management.					singh, shobhit/MHR-5858-2025; Patra, Biswajit/I-3394-2014; Swarnkar, Somil/AAX-3087-2021	Patra, Biswajit/0000-0002-1685-7303; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2024	196	9							827	10.1007/s10661-024-12955-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12955-x								39162888					WOS:001295040700001

Assessing the Potential for Medium-Range Ice Forecasts in the Laurentian Great Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Real-time forecasted ice information for large lakes, such as the Great Lakes, is critical for essential operations, such as ice breaking, commercial navigation, search and rescue, and oil spill response. Existing forecast products for large lake ice conditions are not available for medium-range time horizons (5-16 days out), yet they could provide important information for decision making, particularly for ice breaking and spill responses. In addition, ice forecasts for Earth's largest lakes at these timescales could be important for Medium-Range Weather (MRW) forecasting. However, the skill of existing operational products in predicting ice conditions at MRW timescales has not been studied. This work aims to determine how well ice forecasts from a coupled large lake hydrodynamic-ice model perform for MRW forecast horizons. Simulations were carried out for the 2022 Great Lakes ice season, using 8 different 16-day forecast periods. Forecast results were compared to observations of meteorology and ice conditions from the U.S. National Ice Center. Results show the MRW ice forecasts in the Great Lakes outperform persistence-based forecasts. These findings could inform the development or extension of lake operational ice forecasting and the potential of coupling between atmospheric and large lake models at medium-range forecast time scales. Ice information for large lakes is critical for essential operations, such as ice breaking, commercial navigation, search and rescue, and oil spill response. Ice forecasts are currently not available in the medium-range (5-16 days out) time scale, yet they could provide valuable information for decision making.

This letter aims to identify an optimal model for estimating suspended-matter concentration in the optically complex Lake Taihu of China. Remote sensing reflectance R(rs)(lambda), inherent optical properties, and constituent concentrations of the Lake water were synchronously measured in November of 2007. After the effects of water constituents on R(rs)(lambda) were analyzed, the definitive spectral factors were determined, which are indicative primarily of total suspended matter (TSM). Several methods were compared in modeling the relationship between R(rs)(lambda) and TSM. Results show that the support vector regression (SVR) model performs best with a root-mean-square error of 4.7 mg . l(-1) (R(2) = 0.968). Its predictive errors in four seasons were also assessed with the mean absolute percentage errors varying in the range of 22.0%-60.0%. Thus, the SVR model can be used to reliably retrieve TSM concentrations in Lake Taihu. This finding offers new insights into the optical signals of in-water constituents in optically complex lakes.					; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013; huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017; huang, changchun/E-6580-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X													1545-598X					OCT	2010	7	4					816	820		10.1109/LGRS.2010.2048299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2048299													WOS:000283446700041
J	Dean, WE				Dean, WE			The carbon cycle and biogeochemical dynamics in lake sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The concentrations of organic carbon (OC) and CaCO3 in lake sediments are often inversely related. This relation occurs in surface sediments from different locations in the same lake, surface sediments from different lakes, and with depth in Holocene sediments. Where data on accumulation rates are available, the relation holds for organic carbon and CaCO3 accumulation rates as well. An increase of several percent OC is accompanied by a decrease of several tens of percent CaCO3 indicating that the inverse relation is not due to simple dilution of one component by another. It appears from core data that once the OC concentration in the sediments becomes greater than about 12%, the CO2 produced by decomposition of that OC and production of organic acids lowers the pH of anoxic pore waters enough to dissolve any CaCO3 that reaches the sediment-water interface. In a lake with a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, processes in the water column also can produce an inverse relation between OC and CaCO3 over time. If productivity of the lake increases, the rain rate of OC from the epilimnion increases. Biogenic removal of CO2 and accompanying increase in pH also may increase the production of CaCO3. However, the decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion will decrease the pH of the hypolimnion causing greater dissolution of CaCO3 and therefore a decrease in the rain rate of CaCO3 to the sediment-water interface.																			0921-2728					MAY	1999	21	4					375	393		10.1023/A:1008066118210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008066118210													WOS:000080288200001

Seasonal catch distribution of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), Characidae in a central Amazon floodplain lake: implications for sustainable fisheries management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>Tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum (Cuvier 1818), is one of the largest and most commercially important freshwater fishes in South America, attaining a body size of up to 1 m length and a mass of >= 30 kg. We hypothesize that the mean length of the captured tambaqui was impacted by the fishery. The present study used GIS information to map the Manacapuru Lake system and record tambaqui caught by fishermen from February 2007 to January 2008. Fork lengths of fish were measured and compared to the legal size limit of 55 cm, corresponding to the reproductive age as set by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources). Only 1% of 1271 fish measured were at or above this limit. Spatial distribution of the catch within this floodplain lake system varied, depending on the stage of the hydrologic cycle, but the greatest number of fish was caught within the Piranha Sustainable Development Reserve where fishing is prohibited by law. The results of this study indicate an acute need for enforcement of the law to avoid collapse of the fishery.

Effect of Simulated Browsing on Aspen Regeneration: Implications for Restoration	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is a disturbance-dependent, fire-resilient, shade-intolerant, clonal species that is in decline throughout western North America. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of intensity and season of browsing on annual height growth of aspen suckers. The goal was to aid development of livestock grazing strategies to restore stands in decline due to excessive livestock browsing. We implemented 33 combinations of intensity and season of browse on aspen suckers in three aspen stands on Eagle Lake Range District, Lassen National Forest, California, USA, during 2003 and 2004. Greatest growth was on suckers with no terminal leader browse and <= 25% of biomass removed from branches. Lowest growth occurred when 90% of terminal leader length and 50% of branch biomass was removed. Growth was most negatively affected by browse on terminal leader. Growth was lowest for suckers browsed midseason only and suckers browsed both early and midseason. Occurrence of conifer in the stand overstory significantly reduced sucker growth.

In non-point source pollution areas, it is crucial to investigate the seasonal pollution characteristics to identify the pollution sources. In this study, compositional profiles, seasonal variations, and ecological risks of legacy BFRs and novel BFRs (NBFRs) in the water and sediment from the Tuojiang River located in southwest China were investigated. The results indicated that Sigma BFRs ranged from not detected (n.d.) to 42.0 ng/L in water and from 0.13 to 17.6 ng/g in sediment, while Sigma NBFRs ranged from n.d. to 15.8 ng/L in water, and from 0.25 to 6.82 ng/g in sediment. A significant seasonal variation was observed in water and sediments with high proportions of legacy BFRs (median percentage of 68.8% and 51.3% in water and sediment) in the dry season, while NBFRs (median percentage of 53.2% and 71.6% in water and sediment) exhibited predominance in the wet season. This highlighted the importance of surface runoff and atmospheric deposition as important sources of NBFRs in aquatic environments. Moreover, there were high ratios of decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and BDE-209 (average: 1.38 and 2.76 in dry and wet season) in sediments adjacent to the residual areas, indicating a consumption shift from legacy BFRs to NBFRs in China. It was observed that legacy BFRs showed higher ecological risks compared to NBFRs in both water and sediment environments, with BDE209 posing low to medium risks to sediment organisms. This study provides better understanding of contamination characteristics and sources of legacy BFRs and NBFRs in non-point source pollution areas.

Temporal Variation in Fish Mercury Concentrations within Lakes from the Western Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska	PLOS ONE												We assessed temporal variation in mercury (Hg) concentrations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from Agattu Island, Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. Total Hg concentrations in whole-bodied stickleback were measured at two-week intervals from two sites in each of two lakes from June 1 to August 10, 2011 during the time period when lakes were ice-free. Across all sites and sampling events, stickleback Hg concentrations ranged from 0.37-1.07 mu g/g dry weight (dw), with a mean (+/- SE) of 0.55 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw. Mean fish Hg concentrations declined by 9% during the study period, from 0.57 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw in early June to 0.52 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw in mid-August. Mean fish Hg concentrations were 6% higher in Loon Lake (0.56 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw) than in Lake 696 (0.53 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw), and 4% higher in males (0.56 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw) than in females (0.54 +/- 0.01 mu g/g dw). Loon Lake was distinguished from Lake 696 by the presence of piscivorous waterbirds during the breeding season. Mercury concentrations in stickleback from Agattu Island were higher than would be expected for an area without known point sources of Hg pollution, and high enough to be of concern to the health of piscivorous wildlife.

The cyclicity in the changes in the chemical composition of the water source of the Angara River (Baikal Stock) in 2017-2018 in comparison with the last 20 years of data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The relevance of the research is due to the increasing need for drinking water in the world, the shortage of which is experienced in many countries. The main aim is the study of the chemical composition of freshwater of the Angara River (the drain of Lake Baikal) and the characteristics of its changes. Methods of research: water was sampled at a distance of 1.5-2 m from the shore, from a depth of 0.4-0.5 m, and at the source water intake with the help of a pump. Samples were taken in clean plastic bottles of 1 L in size to determine SO(4)2(-), Cl-, HCO3-, NO2-, HNO3-, SiO2, F-, PO43-, NH4+, O-2, E-C, E-H, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, pH, and temperature. The analyses were accomplished according to standard techniques. It is shown that minor changes in the total content of ions in the water of the Angara River source occur daily, monthly, and depend on a season. Graphically, this is expressed by the curve (broken) line, which manifested the increase, maximum, decrease, minimum, and eventually an endless cycle of repeating the sequence of monthly and annual concentrations of the elements. It was found that the average values of the main ions in the water and the total mineralization of the water source of Angara River and Lake Baikal correspond to their average annual values over the past 20 years. The reason for the constant chemical composition of Baikal and Angara waters may be not only the possibility of already proven chemical and biological self-purification but also the additional penetration of deep waters as a result of upwelling and earthquakes on Lake Baikal. It is concluded that it is necessary to continue further geochemical and microbiological monitoring of the Baikal aquatic ecosystem to assess its composition and quality.

Due to a lack of suitable habitat, nesting is confined to a limited number of sites, including one along a Canadian tributary river: Riviere aux Brochets, Quebec. High egg mortality is a conservation concern for this population; however, little is known about its nesting ecology. We observed nesting behavior from 2003-2016 and recorded environmental variables from 2009-2016 at this site. We monitored hatching success of 75 clutches, in situ and ex situ, and measured morphology of 836 laboratory-incubated hatchlings. Nesting activity occurred mostly in June between 1100-2000. We observed a second clutch within a season four times, laid by two females. Egg laying was more likely on days when the difference between air and water temperatures was smaller. Air temperature, water temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation were not correlated with the probability of egg laying, while high river discharge inhibited egg-laying activities. Nesting behavior and clutch and hatchling characteristics were similar to what has been reported by previous studies. Artificial incubation more than doubled hatching success. Based on our results, we believe that ex situ egg incubation is a useful conservation tool for freshwater turtles in critical situations, in locations where hatching success is naturally low, and threats cannot be easily and rapidly mitigated.

During the period of taking samples, the ambient temperature conditions were taken into account for ten days around the time of sampling. Monitoring of the seasonal maximum with taking into account the obtained tritium soil profile and the temperature on and around the day of sampling unambiguously showed that all tested water in the far Mountains aquatorium is of atmospheric origin and as such unsuitable for any major transformation for commercial purposes.

Longitudinal River Survey of Migratory Fish Larvae and Juveniles by Secure Environmental DNA Field Sampling	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Ayu Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis is a common osmerid freshwater fish distributed in Northeast Asia. Its annual life history allows discriminating 2 forms such as the amphidromous form migrating between river and sea and landlocked form migrating between river and lake or dam reservoir. In the Kando River basin, western Japan, ayu has been one of important fisheries resources, but its catch sustained at a low level after a drastic decline since 2000. This study was undertaken to perform environmental DNA (eDNA) survey for longitudinal distribution of ayu larvae and juveniles in the Kando River along approximately 60 km mainstream length. During the migration season in June 2019 and 2020, ayu juvenile eDNA was detected over the entire area of the Shidzumi Dam Reservoir in the middle reach of the river. During the spawning season in November 2019 and 2020, ayu larva eDNA was detected along approximately 13 km upstream flowing into the dam reservoir. These results first verify the landlocked form migrating between the dam reservoir and its upstream, since the dam blocks downstream migration. Ayu larva eDNA was also detected along approximately 45 km downstream of the dam to river mouth during the spawning season in 2019 and 2020. This result indicates the amphidromous form widely spread in the middle and lower reaches of the river. In addition, our data demonstrate successful reproduction of the both forms of ayu for 2 consecutive years in the Kando River.

Combining fixed-location count data and movement data to estimate abundance of a lake sturgeon spawning run: a framework for riverine migratory species	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Estimating abundance of migrating fishes is challenging. While sonars can be deployed continuously, improper assumptions about unidirectional migration and complete spatial coverage can lead to inaccurate estimates. To address these challenges, we present a framework for combining fixed-location count data from a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) with movement data from acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning run abundance of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). Acoustic telemetry data were used to estimate the probability of observing a lake sturgeon on the DIDSON and to determine the probability that a lake sturgeon passing the DIDSON site had passed the site previously during the season. Combining probabilities with DIDSON counts, using a Bayesian integrated model, we estimated the following abundances: 99 (42-215 credible interval, CI) in 2017, 131 (82-248 CI) in 2018, and 92 (47-184 CI) in 2019. Adding movement data generated better inferences on count data by incorporating fish behavior (e.g., multiple migrations in a single season) and its uncertainty into abundance estimates. This framework can be applied to count and movement data to estimate abundance of spawning runs of other migratory fishes in riverine systems.

Current methods predominantly rely on Water Inundation Frequency (WIF) to extract SIA, which, due to the lack of analysis of dynamic surface water changes, often yields less accurate and robust results. This significantly hampers the rapid and precise mapping of FIA. In the study, based on the Harmonic Models constructed from Long Time-series Surface Water (LTSW) dynamics, an SIA extraction approach (SHM) was introduced to enhance their accuracy and robustness, thereby improving flood mapping. The experiments were conducted in Poyang Lake, a region characterized by active hydrological phenomena. Sentinel-1/2 remote sensing data were utilized to extract LTSW. Harmonic analysis was applied to the LTSW dataset, using the amplitude terms in the harmonic model to characterise the frequency of variation between land and water for the surface units, thus extracting the SIAs. The results reveal that the harmonic model parameters are capable of portraying SIA. In comparison to the commonly used WIF thresholding method for SIA extraction, the SHM approach demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness. Leveraging the SIA extracted through SHM, a higher level of accuracy in FIA extraction is achieved. Overall, the SHM offers notable advantages, including high accuracy, automation, and robustness. It offers reliable reference water extents for flood mapping, especially in areas with active and complex hydrological dynamics. SHM can play a crucial role in emergency response to flood disasters, providing essential technical support for natural disaster management and related departments.					wu, jj/GXG-6138-2022														0924-2716	1872-8235				NOV	2024	217						1	21		10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2024.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2024.08.002		AUG 2024											WOS:001299284800001

Fish (average body mass 2176 +/- 697 g) in the hypertrophic pond were exposed to natural water bloom (dominated by Planktothrix agardhii, Pseudanabaena limnetica and Limnothrix redekei), which contained microcystins (concentration in biomass 20-181 mu g g-1 dry wt, concentration in water 0.3-9.5 mu g L-1). Biochemical parameters in fish blood plasma were analysed in 89 fish at 14-day intervals during the whole season (nine sampling periods). Our results demonstrated high variability and fluctuations in the investigated parameters. The content of microcystins and density of cyanobacterial cells correlated with some haematological indices as lipase, alanine-aminotransferase, albumin, magnesium and chlorides. The concentrations of microcystins in the muscle and liver of the fish (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometer) were below the limit of detection during the monitored period [0.31 ng g-1 fresh weight (f.w.) for the liver and 0.13 ng g-1 f.w. for muscle]. Our study demonstrates that although known cyanobacterial toxin microcystins were not detected in the fish tissues, several biochemical parameters important for the fish physiology were modulated by natural cyanobacterial bloom.

The goals of this study were to assess which environmental gradients can be important in predicting viral abundance (VA), the frequency of virus-infected cells (FVIC) and burst size (BS), and to assess which lake characters favour viral-induced bacterial mortality (VBM) as opposed to potential grazer-induced bacterial mortality (PGBM). 2. The epilimnion and hypolimnion of 21 lakes differing in trophic status and humic content were investigated. Samples were obtained for viral and bacterial abundance, the FVIC and burst size, flagellate and ciliate abundances and water chemistry. The potential importance of VBM in relation to PGBM was calculated based on data on FVIC and flagellate and ciliate abundance. 3. Partial least squares regression (PLS) analysis showed that VA as well as the ratio between viral and bacterial abundance were positively related to inorganic nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic carbon concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration and bacterial production. 4. The PLS model also revealed that FVIC decreased with increasing trophic status whereas BS increased. Furthermore, potential grazing was positively related to increasing trophic status and decreasing humic content. PGBM appeared to be dominating over VBM in the majority of lakes sampled, especially in the epilimnion. 5. Thus, the relative importance of viruses for bacterial mortality was potentially highest in humic lakes of medium trophic status and it was also greater in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion.					; Lymer, David/AAP-8593-2020; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016	Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071; Lymer, David/0000-0002-3678-2150													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2008	53	6					1101	1113		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02015.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02015.x													WOS:000255713100004
J	Rogalus, MK; Watzin, MC				Rogalus, Meghan Kreider; Watzin, Mary C.			Evaluation of sampling and screening techniques for tiered monitoring of toxic cyanobacteria in lakes	HARMFUL ALGAE												Exposure to cyanotoxins can pose serious human health consequences both through drinking water and recreational use of a contaminated waterway. We adapted a tiered framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for monitoring cyanobacteria populations and assessing public health risks and implemented the program in Lake Champlain. This study focused on evaluating the sampling protocols employed in this adapted monitoring program over two field seasons (2003 and 2004). Using a paired sampling design, we evaluated whether 63-mu m Wisconsin net samples adequately represented whole-water conditions and whether chlorophyll a concentration could serve as a useful predictor of cyanobacteria density and microcystin concentration. We also evaluated the spatial and temporal dynamics of blooms and their implications for monitoring. Our results suggest that using threshold values of either potentially toxic cyanobacteria density counted using a rapid screening protocol or chlorophyll a concentration serve as initial indicators of potentially high levels of cyanotoxin; however, the utility of chlorophyll a is system-dependent. Whole-water samples provide more accurate estimates of population density and higher microcystin concentrations than net samples, offering a more cautionary approach to assessing risk to recreational lake users. Shoreline samples generally showed higher cyanotoxin concentrations than offshore, but restricting sampling to the shoreline may miss early warnings of bloom development. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In eastern Africa, the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was identified as one of the primary drivers of precipitation variability affecting water availability. However, the northern East African Rift System (EARS) still suffers from the underrepresentation of predictive and ENSO teleconnection models because of the scarcity of local to regional historical or palaeo-data.In this paper, we provide a 50-year seasonal flood and drought chronicle of the Awash River catchment from the study of laminated sediment from Gemeri and Afambo lakes (central Afar region, Ethiopia) with the aim of reconstructing the magnitude of regional hydroclimatic events. Pluricentimetric micro-laminated lithogenic facies alternating with plurimillimetric carbonate-enriched facies are investigated in both lakes. We couple dating methods including radiocarbon, short-lived radionuclides, palaeomagnetic field variations, and varve counting on both lake deposits to build a high-resolution age model and to discuss the regional hydrosedimentary dynamics of the Awash River over the last similar to 700 years with a focus on the last 50 years.Using a multiproxy approach, we observe that following a multicentennial enhanced hydrological period, the two lakes have experienced a gradual decrease in river load inflow since 1979 CE, attaining extreme drought and high evaporative conditions between 1991 and 1997 CE. In 2014, the construction of a dam and increased agricultural water management in the lower Awash River plain impacted the erodibility of local soils and the hydrosedimentary balance of the lake basins, as evidenced by a disproportionate sediment accumulation rate.Comparison of our quantitative reconstruction with (i) lake water surface evolution, (ii) the interannual Awash River flow rates, and (iii) the El Ni & ntilde;o 3.4 model highlights the intermittent connections between ENSO sea surface temperature anomalies, regional droughts, and hydrological conditions in the northern EARS.

J	Zhang, YZ; Wünnemann, B; Yan, DD; Lockot, G				Zhang, Yongzhan; Wuennemann, Bernd; Yan, Dada; Lockot, Gregori			Late Quaternary persistent impacts of permafrost on lake hydrology and landscape evolution on the NE Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role on influencing regional to local hydrology of lake systems by thermokarst processes. Rare investigations and research of such process variations and how they affect persistently the water budget and landscape cratering in alpine lake basin through the Late Quaternary are reported. We used Lake Heihai on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau as an example to reveal how landscape change/collapse under the regime of permafrost and thermokarst processes occurred since the Lateglacial. Five shallow seismic profiles in combination with lake core sediments from the lake centre as well as fossil lacustrine deposits in the catchment were obtained and analysed by multiple proxies. The results show that Lake Heihai did not exist as a terminal lake during the Lateglacial and the beginning of the early Holocene with widespread permafrost in the basin. Permafrost thaw and glacier melt of short duration contributed to lake hydrology and sediment accu- mulation. Thermokarst development started in the early Holocene with climate warming and increased water storage in the shallow basin, finally enabling the onset of a thermokarst lake with subsidence of lake deposits. Thermokarst thaw contributed reworked materials to the lake during the formation of a growing talik layer beneath the lake. The damming of the previous outflow in the east by glacio-fluvial accumulation initiated a closed system, combined with the accelerated thermokarst subsidence, which promoted a rapid lake level rise during the middle Holocene, mainly supplied by glacier melt. This period was characterized by the withdrawal of permafrost to higher position in the catchment. Lake Heihai became open again after around 5.3 ka and initiated a significant shrinkage culminating at around 4 cal ka BP and lasted until 2.4 cal ka BP. Permafrost returned into the exposed middle Holocene lacustrine sediments which were then subject to strong seasonal thaw-induced erosion and back transport into the lake, while water depth increased to the present level with returned thermokarst processes at the lake margin. Recent occurrences and disappearances of permafrost phenomena near shore, such as lithalsa/pingos, might have existed in the past as well. Our research sheds new light on the long-lasting impacts of permafrost on the hydrological cycle and integrated landscape evolution in a lake basin on the Tibetan Plateau.

Selective precipitation of schwertmannite in a stratified acidic pit lake of Iberian Pyrite Belt	MINERALOGICAL MAGAZINE												Selective precipitation of schwertmannite was identified in the water column of a chemically stratified acidic lake (pH 2.0-2.5). A set of analytical techniques was used to identify accurately the mineral phase (X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy). The lake has two clearly differentiated layers: a thin superficial layer that extends to similar to 2 m in depth with less dissolved solid content and, therefore, lower density, which contrasts with a thicker lower layer that extends to 34 m in depth. The upper layer is strongly influenced by climatic factors, triggering dilution (rainfall), concentration (dry season) and intense seasonal thermal fluctuations, while the lower layer is more compositionally and thermally stable. Schwertmannite precipitate was initially observed only in the upper layer, adhered to a plastic buoy and the anchor line. The latter was confirmed through a test involving a precipitation device that consisted of maintaining a series of plastic plates at different depths over a period of several months. Only the plates located in the upper layer became covered with precipitate, whereas the plates that were submerged in the lower layer remained clean. These observations clearly differed from the saturation indices of schwertmannite (S-sch) calculated using PHREEQC and using Bigham et al. (1996) or Kawano and Tomita (2001) solubility products. Schwertmannite would not precipitate in the lake with the former but would precipitate in both layers with the latter. It is the constant provided by Yu et al. (1999) that makes SIsch in both layers approach the observed behaviour: SIsch>0 displays oversaturation in the upper layer while SIsch<0 displays undersaturation in the lower layer. The value of the product of solubility that better adjusts to this situation is log K-sch = 9.5-10. Using the method by Yu et al. (1999) to establish the apparent solubility, a range of log K-sch values was defined between 10.5 and 11.5 for the system studied.

Leptospirosis is a cosmopolitan disease of zoonotic importance that affects most mammals. At the southern Gulf of Mexico, Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) inhabit highly variable environments, with extended floods during the rainy season and drought conditions during the dry season that affect food availability and the thermal environment for manatees. We tested for changes in prevalence and titers of antibodies to 12 serovars of Leptospira interrogans,in manatees between dry and rainy seasons. We determined titers for L. interrogans through microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) from 10 manatees, six during the dry season (DS), and six during the rainy season (RS) in Laguna de las Ilusiones, a landlocked lake hosting a population of about 20 manatees. All individuals were antibody positive (titers >= 100) to at least one serovar. The serovars bataviae, bratislava, canicola, and icterohaemorrhagiae had overall prevalences >= 50% bataviae, bratislava, and canicola had prevalences during both seasons. Serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and pyrogenes had prevalences >= 50% during DS and pomona, tarassovi, wolfii, and autumnalis during RS. Significant differences in prevalence between seasons were found for pomona, tarassovi, and autumnalis Titers of tarassovi, wolfii, autumnalis, and bataviae were significantly higher during RS. There was a high prevalence of L. interrogans during the RS independent of high availability of plant foods, coinciding with the epizootiology of the bacteria that are endemic to tropical regions. Another factor possibly influencing prevalence is high anthropogenic pressure at the lake, causing an increase in potential sources of infection. Because of possible cross-reaction in MAT, further research is needed on the molecular discrimination of serovars in animals in the lake.

A recently launched satellite sensor, HJ-CCD, by China possesses high temporal resolution, medium spatial resolution, and wide swath, so it is convenient for monitoring this parameter in large inland waters. However, no operational method currently exists for retrieving the total suspended matter concentration of turbid inland waters from HJ-CCD data. Using Lake Taihu in Eastern China as a study area, we obtained and analyzed optical properties of the lake during all seasons, and found that the absorption coefficient of suspended matter, chlorophyll, and colored dissolved organic matter of the near-infrared band may approximate zero. Based on this analysis, we found that a single band method of retrieving concentration using the near-infrared band was suitable using HJ-CCD data. We parameterized the single band method with specific inherent optical properties of Lake Taihu, and validated it using the results retrieved from a HJ-CCD image taken on 14 March 2009, as well as water-surface quasi-synchronous measured data. The concentration retrieved from the image is precise and stable; the single band method uses the established specific optical property database in the study area for input parameters, and does not need support from synchronous data. With this method, HJ-CCD may be applied to retrieve total suspended matter of other highly turbid inland waters.

Reproductive activities of two zooplanktivorous clupeid fish in relation to the seasonal abundance of copepod prey in the northern end of Lake Tanganyika	BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Reproductive activities of two commercially exploited clupeid fishes (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon) in the northern end of Lake Tanganyika (Bujumbura sub-basin) were investigated during two different years (2004-2005 and 2007-2008). We hypothesized that the timing of largest reproductive investment in these pelagic species coincides with the onset of the rainy season and the highest abundance of copepod prey. For S. tanganicae, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly higher prior to the onset of the rainy season, and this was observed in both years. For L. miodon, however, this pattern was overall weaker and only statistically significant in 2004-2005. In both species, spawning activities did not seem to be adjusted to provide optimal feeding conditions for the larvae. Instead, investment in reproduction seemed to be related to the availability of copepods in the preceding months. We conclude that the timing of reproductive activities in these clupeids is species-specific, and might be subject to strong year-to-year variation.

However, three major challenges impede the accuracy of hydrological simulation and impact assessment processes, namely avoiding uncertainties caused by climate scenarios, selecting comprehensive hydrological indicators, and enhancing spatiotemporal precision of hydrological simulation. To address these issues, the current case study used the Lake Dianchi Basin (LDB) to demonstrate a sub-catchment scale and detailed integrated model framework. This framework was generated based on localized climate change possibilities, detailed hydrological simulation results, and a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on hydrologic regimes. The results showed that (1) the sub-tropical LDB has hydrologic regimes that are significantly impacted by climate change with changes in precipitation exerting a greater impact than air temperature changes. (2) The annual scale runoff, as well as 16 other hydrological indicators exhibit large variation among the 18 climate scenarios. Wet season and 1/3/7-day minimums/maximums may be more significantly impacted by climate change than dry season and other indicators. (3) The hydrologic regimes of the LDB is vulnerable to climate change, which may pose enormous ecological and socio-economic risk to the LDB. Among all six sub-catchments, Sub_06, characterized by a hilly landscape, would be impacted the most by climate change. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that regions with complex climatic conditions and topography have different responses in annual scale runoff and extreme indicators, which must be fully considered.

We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of POM in near-shore waters of Lake Biwa, a large, meso-eutrophic lake in Japan, to estimate relative contributions of terrigenous particulate organic carbon (T-POC), plankton-derived POC (P-POC) and epilithon-derived POC (E-POC) to POC in near-shore waters. Samples were collected during different months (November, February, May and July) at 29 sites located near the mouth of tributary rivers with different discharge and catchment land use. The data revealed that POC mainly consisted of P-POC and T-POC, with relative contributions varying widely over season and among locations. E-POC generally contributed little to the near-shore POC. Path analyses revealed that the concentration of riverine POC whose isotopic signatures were similar to those of rice straws increased with a larger %paddy field area in the catchment of tributary rivers, which subsequently enhanced T-POC inputs to near-shore waters through riverine transportation. Furthermore, our results suggested that T-POC contribution was influenced, with a time lag, by wave-driven turbulence and shore topography, which appear to affect sedimentation and resuspension of T-POC.

Seasonal variability in the δ13C and δ15N values of the zooplankton taxa in two alpine lakes	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in crustacean taxa were measured once a month in two alpine lakes over a 2-year period in order to address seasonal changes in the isotope composition of the zooplankton. Daphnia sp. was used as the 'pelagic baseline' (i.e. primary sources fueling the pelagic food web), as it exhibited the lowest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values among the crustacean taxa. Seasonal changes resulting from modifications in the trophic position of other crustacean taxa were assessed by comparing their seasonal delta C-13 and delta N-15 values to those of Daphnia sp. Baseline modifications were addressed by relating them to physical, chemical and biological changes in the epilimnion. In Lake Geneva, all the crustacean taxa rely on the same carbon source and occupy relative trophic positions that display no major changes over time. In contrast, in Lake Annecy, the crustacean food web was found to be much more complex. The crustacean taxa apparently obtained their carbon from differing primary sources and their relative trophic positions changed during the year. This study raises the question of the ambiguity of the pelagic baseline concept when applied to zooplankton trophic studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

The abundance of floodplain lakes, including both naturally connected and main stem-isolated lakes, declines in a downstream direction in the lower reach of the Yangtze River, forming a longitudinal reduction gradient. We investigated whether this longitudinal reduction gradient of floodplain lakes is an essential driver of the larval fish assemblage patterns in the river. Drifting larval fish were investigated weekly during the prevailing spawning season both in 2014 and 2015 among three locations at Wangjiang (WJ), Zhenjiang (ZJ) and Nantong (NT). Thirty-four species belonging to 28 genera and eight families were identified. The number and abundances of collected species, the reproduction duration for dominant species and the niche breadth of dominant species all exhibit a longitudinal decrease (WJ > ZJ > NT) in the downstream direction. Additionally, the bloom of larval fish tended to occur earlier at WJ than at ZJ and NT. We suggest that these results reflect the crucial effect of floodplain lake distribution in shaping the longitudinal distribution pattern of larval assemblages. Both natural connected lakes and isolated lakes (with irregular connectivity patterns) play a crucial role in recruitment success of freshwater fish in the system. Hence, conservation and management approaches for fish resources should be concentrated on restoring and maintaining river-lake connectivity in the upstream sections of the lower reach of the Yangtze River.

To clarify both the accumulation and depuration of microcystins, experimental studies with microcystin were also carried out on the snail. In the field investigation, microcystin was detected from the hepatopancreas and intestine of S. histrica (up to 3.2mugg(-1) dry weight and 19.5mugg(-1) dry weight, respectively); however, no microcystin was detected in the hepatopancreas of C. sandai. In the laboratory experiment, the microcystin-LR concentration in the hepatopancreas of S. histrica reached a value of 436 mugg(-1) dry weight on day 10 of 15 days of uptake, and a high value persisted despite a depuration period of 15 days. The depuration rate constant of microcystin and its biological half-life were 0.0828 day(-1) and 8.4 days, respectively. These results indicate that S. histrica has a high ability to accumulate microcystin in its tissue. Because S. histrica is predated by fish and water fowl, it is likely to play an important role as a vector for microcystin in lakes with dense blooms of toxic cyanobacteria.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2003	4	3					131	138		10.1007/s10201-003-0106-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0106-1													WOS:000187075200002
J	Hillebrand, H				Hillebrand, H			Opposing effects of grazing and nutrients on diversity	OIKOS												Conceptual models predict counteractive effects of herbivores and nutrient enrichment on plant diversity and reversed effects of grazers under different nutrient regimes. I tested these hypotheses in I I field experiments with periphyton communities in three different aquatic habitats (a highly eutrophic lake, an meso-eutrophic lake, and an meso-eutrophic part of the Baltic Sea coast) and in different seasons. Grazer access and nutrient supply were manipulated in a factorial design. Species richness and evenness were chosen as response variables. Both manipulated factors had significant and contrasting effects on diversity, with variable effect strength between sites and seasons. From the two aspects of diversity, evenness well reflected the changes in community composition. Fertilization tended to increase the dominance of few species and thus to decrease evenness, whereas grazers counteracted these effects by removing dominant life forms. The response of species richness was not as expected, since grazers decreased richness throughout, whereas nutrients had weaker effects but tended to increase richness. Species richness rather reflected changes in periphyton architecture. Grazers reduced algal richness presumably by co-consumption of rare species in the tightly connected periphyton assemblages, whereas enrichment may increase richness by providing more structure via increased dominance of filamentous species. Although grazer and nutrient effects on richness and evenness were opposing, there was no change in the effect of one factor by manipulation of the other.

J	Ackerman, JD; Loewen, MR; Hamblin, PF				Ackerman, JD; Loewen, MR; Hamblin, PF			Benthic-Pelagic coupling over a zebra mussel reef in western Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We conducted a field study including a series of cruises over an isolated offshore zebra mussel reef (7-11 m deep) in Western Lake Erie to examine the effect of zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) on the water column. The horizontal currents over the reef were found to be primarily due to the hydraulic Bow and surface gravitational seiches. The turbulence generated by these currents was found to be too weak to fully mix the water column. Although seasonal stratification was not observed, solar heating during the day and intrusions of cold central basin water caused stable stratification of the water column 60% of the time. Results from the seston analysis taken at five depths showed a statistically significant mussel-feeding signature in chlorophyll a and organic seston concentrations measured within 2 m above the reef. Estimates of clearance rates based on field data were consistent with rates measured in a flow chamber using water from the site, which indicated that zebra mussels could remove up to 40% of the total seston. The detection of a zebra mussel-induced concentration boundary layer is due to: (1) reduced vertical mixing as a result of semidiurnal periodic stratification, (2) refiltration of bottom water in zebra mussel populations, and (3) in situ clearance rates that are lower than those observed in the laboratory. Thus, offshore zebra mussel colonies may have less of an effect on the water column than had been previously estimated by simple stirred reactor models, and the role of zebra mussels in the clarification of Lake Erie should be investigated further.					; Loewen, Mark/E-5645-2013	Ackerman, Josef/0000-0003-4550-490X; Loewen, Mark/0000-0002-6854-5926													0024-3590					JUN	2001	46	4					892	904		10.4319/lo.2001.46.4.0892	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.4.0892													WOS:000169214600014

Daphnia body size and population dynamics under predation by invertebrate and fish predators in Lago Maggiore:: an approach based on contribution analysis	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Predation on Daphnia is size-specific: while zooplanktivorous fish select large, ovigerous females, carrying larger clutches, predation by invertebrates, particularly Cladocera, is generally regarded as acting mainly on young, small, non-ovigerous females. The two types of predators there ore produce different effects on the population of their prey: fish predation results in decreases in Daphnia fecundity, proportion of adults, and maximum body size, while predation by the invertebrate predators leads to decreases in the number and proportion of juvenile Daphnia. We investigated the effect of predation by three predators (one vertebrate, two invertebrates) on Daphnia. The study combines contribution analysis of Daphnia birth rate dynamics, with a body-size-oriented analysis of both predator and prey populations. Cortribution analysis showed that during April-May, when Bythotrephes densities were low, changes in Daphnia birth rate were due to both changes in fecundity (ConF) and in the proportion of adults (ConA), with ConA being much larger (by absolute value) than ConF; such a pattern is expected under fish predation. Whereas during mid May to June, when Bythotrephes densities were high, changes in Daphnia birth rate were again mainly due to both ConF and ConA, but now the difference between these contributions was less pronounced. Although Bythotrephes predation produced similar effects on Daphnia population dynamics as fish predation, affecting both fecundity and the proportion of adults, it can be distinguished in two ways from fish predation. Firstly, the ConF-ConA pattern is more unniform under invertebrate predation than under fish predation and secondly, the mean body size of Daphnia increased continuously whereas the mean size of ovigerous females remained approximately constant except for the last 3 weeks of June, indicating a high mortality of juveniles during the whole period and an increased mortality of young females with eggs during the last 3 weeks. We conclude that both zooplanktivorous fish and invertebrate predators affect population dynamics of Daphnia in Lago Maggiore. However, the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes has the largest impact on Daphnia dynamics in June, both because of its high densities and its relatively large size at that time. Predation pressure exerted by Bythotrephes is high enough to reduce the Daphnia densities at the end of June to low values.

Specifically, we (1) characterize the variability of stable water isotopic composition across several lakes of varying size and depth and (2) determine the evaporation as a fraction of inflow using stable isotopes of water for these lakes. We have used the Hydrocalculator tool for estimation of the evaporation to inflow (E/I) ratio. Results indicated that larger lakes have lower seasonal variability in isotopic composition across their depth compared with the smaller lakes. Further, there was clear seasonal variation across the monthly E/I ratios estimated in several lakes, indicating that evaporation likely plays some (albeit limited) role in the water level variability experienced within a year.

Expanding freshwater biologger studies to view fish as environmental sensing platforms	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												While recording fish habitat use by electronic sensors, biologgers can also be viewed as autonomous environmental monitoring systems with the organism as a vehicle. This dual perspective has provided novel results from marine ecosystems, but has not been applied to freshwater ecosystems. To understand limitations in fresh water, we evaluated miniature depth and temperature recorders as aquatic monitoring systems in a Laurentian Great Lake: Erie. As part of an acoustic telemetry study, biologgers were opportunistically implanted in a subsample of walleye Sander vitreus. Biologgers recorded temperature and depth at half-hour intervals for up to 1 year. Recaptures provided six biologgers for analysis of seasonal temperature patterns and lake stratification, key variables for understanding dimictic lakes. Depth-resolved temperature patterns showed close correspondence with independent weather buoy measurements. Because the buoy was deployed late in the season, biologger data provided improved estimates of the start of stratification, which had important implications for understanding development of hypoxia in the hypolimnion. Drawbacks to biologger data included imprecise knowledge of fish location and reliance on tag recoveries from the fishery. Optimistically, our results show how biologgers could be part of a monitoring approach that integrates limnological surveys with fisheries science.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2022	73	1					133	139		10.1071/MF21046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF21046		NOV 2021											WOS:000713980000001

Starting from momentum balance considerations on a single sediment floc, the Shields dimensionless mobility parameter in incipient motion conditions is expressed also as a function of both cohesive and adhesive forces that concur to stabilize the superficial layer of the benthic sediment. The entrainment model is validated on the basis of laboratory experiments carried out on natural benthic sediments sampled from three alpine Italian lakes, having different trophic conditions and different compositions of the bed. The experimental results show that the cohesive effects decrease as the sediment water content increases. Moreover the role of bioadhesion is experimentally evaluated: the critical shear stresses of 'iving' sediments are higher than that measured on similar but 'dead', poisoned sediments. This stabilizing effect shows a variation in time on a seasonal time scale, accordingly to the literature indications where biological adhesion is related to phytoplankton and bacteria activity, the life and growth of which obviously depends on seasonal variations.

Lacustrine carbonates, including incorporated molluscs and diatoms, a lake shoreline feature and stabalised linear dunes were investigated for their constituent palacoenvironmental signals. Chronometric control is provided by calibrated C-14, AMS and OSL dating. The evidence suggests that linear dune construction has not occurred since the Last Glacial Maximum, with particular development from 36 to 28 ka. Lake stands indicating wetter regional conditions than present occurred at 40-32 ka, with more seasonal conditions from 36 ka, and at 27-12 ka with a possible drying out at 22-19 ka. Data are consistent with other independent studies from the region, and with recent evidence obtained from Atlantic cores off the coast of Namibia. It is concluded that careful consideration of multi-proxy data from a single location can assist in resolving discrepancies that arise from independent studies of lake, cave and dune records in the Kalahari.

In order to understand the degree of eutrophication and the changing trend of important drinking water sources in the coastal areas of Western Guangdong, ensuring the safety of drinking water, this paper takes Gaozhou Reservoir as the research object. According to the long-term monitoring results of eutrophication index of reservoirs from 2012 to 2019, spatial and temporal analysis of each evaluation indicator and the comprehensive nutrient status of the reservoir was conducted using the integrated nutrient status index method. Based on the Weber-Fechner (W-F) law, an early warning model for reservoir eutrophication and grading evaluation was established. The results showed that Gaozhou Reservoir was in mesotrophic state, and the eutrophication was more serious in the high water period than in the low water period. TLI (TN) was the largest contributor to eutrophication of the reservoir, and all nutritional status indexes show mild eutrophication. Chl-a, phosphorus nutrients and organic matter had little effect on the degree of eutrophication. The fluctuation of the eutrophication status at each monitoring section of the reservoir was relatively stable. The TLI(sigma) of Liangde Dam was lower than that of the Shigu Reservoir, and the comprehensive nutritional status of the Shigu area in the decreasing order was tail > supply port > centre. According to the established early warning model, the eutrophication status in different seasons from 2012 to 2019 was evaluated. The results indicated that the comprehensive influence index value of the dry period was less than that of the flood period due to the influence of seasonal factors. In addition, the model has a good warning effect; it provides theoretical support and prevention and control methods for ecological environmental protection of reservoirs.

Millennial-scale variability in Holocene aquatic productivity from Burial Lake, Arctic Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Holocene records of lacustrine primary production are commonly used to reconstruct past changes in environmental and climatic conditions. While several methods exist to infer paleoproductivity trends, few studies to date have applied multiple geochemical indices in the same core sequence from Arctic lakes to evaluate their fidelity and sensitivity to specific climate variables over long (Holocene length) timescales. In this study, we evaluate sub-century to millennial-scale fluctuations in paleoproductivity over the Holocene using geochemical (biogenic opal and sedimentary chlorin) analyses of sediments from Burial Lake in the western Brooks Range, Alaska. Large fluctuations in opal and related proxies occur at millennial timescales over the last 10,000 years. We interpret the changes in opal to result from variability in diatom productivity, which is indirectly mediated by climate primarily through changes in the duration of the ice-free growing season and the availability of limiting nutrients at this oligotrophic, tundra lake. Comparison of the opal and sedimentary chlorin record, which is correlated with TOC, shows contrasting patterns on both short (century to multi-century) and relatively long (millennial) time scales. The concentration of opal far exceeds that of TOC and variations in sediment dry bulk density, driven by changes in the accumulation of opal, are likely responsible in part for the variations in sedimentary chlorin. Further, C/N ratio values indicate a mixed algal-terrestrial source of sedimentary organic matter. This result highlights the complexity in the climatic interpretation of sedimentary chlorin as an index of whole lake production, because the signal is prone to dilution/concentration from opal and also reflects a combination of aquatic and terrestrial production. Time series analysis of the productivity records indicates the presence of a significant similar to 1500-yr oscillation in opal concentration, which has been found in North Atlantic Ocean proxy records and numerous other marine and terrestrial paleorecords. Comparison of diatom productivity against a sea-ice inferred reconstruction of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) from the Beaufort Sea (Darby et al., 2012) shows that periods of reduced productivity at Burial Lake coincide with inferred positive phases of the AO (AO+). Combined with modern observations of sea ice extent and meteorological data, we hypothesize that AO + conditions and a strengthened polar jet correspond with a shortened ice-free growing season, a decrease in the availability of limiting nutrients, and lower levels of diatom production at Burial Lake. Comparison of the spectral properties between opal and the AO reconstruction reveal similar millennial scale variations with similar to 1500-yr variability during the middle Holocene that transition to similar to 1000-yr variability during the late Holocene. In light of these findings, we suggest the possibility that millennial variations in diatom productivity observed in the Burial Lake record are related to millennial variability in high-latitude atmospheric circulation similar to the AO. These results shed light on the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems in northern Alaska to changes in the duration of the ice-free growing season, the availability of limiting nutrients for phytoplankton growth, and Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation dynamics over the Holocene on millennial timescales.

J	Reuter, J; Buenning, N; Yoshimura, K				Reuter, Justin; Buenning, Nikolaus; Yoshimura, Kei			Evaluating hydrological influences on mid-latitude δ18Op in the Middle East	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The oxygen isotope ratio of precipitation (delta O-18(p)) in the mid-latitudes varies in response to multiple climate influences imposing significant challenges to the interpretation of climate proxies such as the oxygen isotope ratio of lake and speleothem calcite (delta O-18(c)) that incorporates an isotopic finger print of precipitation. This challenge is particularly acute for pre-historic time periods when climate forcings differed significantly from modern and consequently, internal feedbacks altered the transport of moisture as well as the rate of fractionation that determine the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture. Here we investigate how delta O-18(p) from the mid-Holocene was influenced by internal feedbacks in the Holocene with an isotope-enabled climate model that simulates the atmospheric response to changing boundary conditions and different climatic forcing. We find that delta O-18(p) during the Mid-Holocene was lower than present day consistent with published proxy records. However, this lower value cannot be simply explained by basic isotope drivers such as precipitation amount or seasonality. Rather, we find that the combination of changes in local surface temperature, precipitation amount, upstream isotopic composition of vapor as well as the season can quantitatively explain the isotopic differences between the mid-Holocene and present day.

Rate of species introductions in the Great Lakes via ships' ballast water and sediments	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We report results from a study of species in ballast tanks of ships entering the Great Lakes between 2000 and 2002. We collected 1349 individuals from at least 93 unique taxonomic groups, of which approximately half were identified to species. We estimated that the zooplankton assemblage in ballast water destined for the Great Lakes comprised from 200 to 1000 unique taxa consisting of both freshwater and marine species. Between 14 and 39 of these taxa have not yet been recorded from the Great Lakes. Further, 13.9% of individual specimens identified to the species level were from species not previously collected from the Great Lakes. We collected seven nonindigenous freshwater species not currently found in the Great Lakes: Brachionus plicatilis, Cyclocypria kinkaidia, Maraenobiotus insignipes, Microcyclops rubellus, Microcyclops varicans, Neomysis awatchensis, and Paracyclops chiltoni. We found no evidence that ship age, seasonal timing, or age of ballast water affected the abundance of individuals or species in the ballast tanks. To our knowledge, these are the first extrapolations of data from ballast water collections to estimate the rate of species introduction to any ecosystem.

However, these studies are still very limited in Mediterranean freshwaters. The aim of the study was to link functional groups with environmental factors and ecosystem processes for zooplankton in the Lake Iznik, which is an alkaline lake in Turkiye. Morphological, physiological and behavioural categories have been selected as response traits. Physical and chemical variables and trophic state are important predictors of functional traits. A total of 26 zooplankton taxa belonging to four taxonomic groups were classified into five functional groups according to functional traits. It was found that functional groups were significantly affected by seasonally changing environmental conditions, but not by depth. The main predictor of zooplankton functional groups was electrical conductivity. As a result of the alkaline conditions and the deterioration of the trophic state of the lake (meso similar to to eutrophy), the low taxonomic richness, dominance of the microphagous feeding type and small-bodied taxa indicate ecosystem degradation leading to functional depletion (homogenisation). The results showed that temporal variations of environmental variables can affect zooplankton functional groups and that trait-based zooplankton studies will enable a better understanding of ecosystem processes in deep alkaline lakes.

Phytoplankton samples were collected from the surface and bottom of the reservoir. The phytoplankton samples were later identified at the species level, and the species were further assigned to morphology-based functional groups (MBFGs). Zooplankton were sampled through vertical haul, communities were identified to species level, and functional diversity was estimated based on community-weighted means (CWM). Phytoplankton MBFGs IV, V, and VI contributed the most to the biomass under high light availability coupled with low nutrient availability. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria from MBFG III were observed during thermal stratification. Hydraulic mixing plays a crucial role in reducing the phytoplankton biomass during the warmer/rainy season. Cyclopoid copepods accounted for more than 83% of the zooplankton biomass. There was a weak but significant effect of zooplankton functional diversity on phytoplankton functional diversity, mainly because of the dominance of small zooplankton. Altogether, our findings suggest that environmental filtering plays a greater role than zooplankton grazing in phytoplankton community structure in this shallow tropical reservoir.

Success of a large riverine cyprinid smallmouth yellowfish Labeobarbus aeneus in a southern African impoundment	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Rheophilic cyprinids have been detrimentally affected by impoundments, which alter flow regimes, the physical environment and block migration routes. Initial evidence for a southern African cyprinid, smallmouth yellowfish Labeobarbus aeneus, suggested that dependence on riverine spawning areas limits their success within the turbid impoundments of the Orange River system. However, well-established impoundment populations have since been documented. A comprehensive assessment of L.aeneus biology and population dynamics was undertaken to understand the drivers of successful colonisation in Lake Gariep, South Africa's largest impoundment. Labeobarbus aeneus exhibited slow growth, delayed maturity and longevity, most likely resulting in slow population growth rates. Highest adult and juvenile abundances were observed >100km from the inflowing Orange River during the peak and post-spawning seasons, respectively, suggesting that the species displays high ecological plasticity and may not be dependent on inflowing rivers for spawning. Meta-analyses of life history parameters indicated consistency among riverine and lacustrine populations. Although experiencing an initial lag phase, L.aeneus has successfully adapted to the lacustrine environment.

Herbivory delays flowering and reduces fecundity of Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraceae), an endangered, endemic plant of the Florida scrub	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												KETTENRING, K.

Herbivory delays flowering and reduces fecundity of Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraccae), an endangered, endemic plant of the Florida scrub. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 136: 350-362. 2009.-Herbivores may negatively impact plants by reducing biomass and decreasing fecundity. Rare or endangered plants may be particularly vulnerable to herbivore damage. However. plants may compensate for herbivory by increased growth or reproductive Output. We investigated compensatory growth and reproductive effort in Liatris ohlingerae (S.F.Blake) B.L.Robe, a federally-listed herb narrowly endemic to pyrogenic Florida scrub on the Lake Wales Ridge, by conducting biweekly surveys of observed herbivory and an herbivore exclusion experiment. In the field surveys, we assessed the effects of vertebrate herbivory ("topping") and invertebrate leaf herbivory on plant size and fecundity and compared observed levels of herbivory across sites with different disturbance histories (scrub vs. roadside; scrub sites with differing time-since-fire). In the herbivore exclusion experiment, we compared the effects on plant size and fecundity of excluding vertebrate herbivores (toppers) only vs. excluding both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. We found that 62% of plants in the Survey had one or more topped steins and that topping occurred more frequently in recently burned sites (< 8 years since fire vs. > 14 years since fire) and in scrub than in roadside sites. Topped plants were significantly shorter and had a greater number of steins (untopped plants only produced I stem). Topped plants were less likely to flower, began flowering later in the growing season, and produced fewer inflorescences, infructescences, achenes, and full achenes than untopped plants. Fifty-two percent of surveyed L. ohlingerae plants also showed evidence of invertebrate leaf herbivory with a mean of 24% of leaves damaged. Plants damaged by invertebrate herbivores did not differ significantly in growth or reproduction compared with undamaged plants. In the experiment, exclusion of vertebrate herbivores resulted in taller plants, fewer stems, higher flowering frequency, earlier first flowering, and greater production of inflorescences, infructescences, achenes, and full achenes per plant; plants gained no additional benefits when invertebrates were excluded. Our study demonstrates that L. ohlingerae partially compensates for vertebrate herbivore damage at some sites, depending on the disturbance history. There are population level consequences of undercompensation; vertebrate topping resulted in a 30% reduction in mean fecundity. Future research is necessary to determine if undercompensation jeopardizes the long-term persistence of L. ohlingerae populations.

However, our understanding of the structure and functioning of littoral food webs is constricted, because their zooplankton communities remain virtually unstudied. We investigated variability in the structure and dynamics of littoral zooplankton communities, in relation to landscape-level gradients in environmental conditions, in four shallow bays in the Aland archipelago during one growing season. The variability was best explained by the productivity potential, i.e. the concurrent effects of temperature, trophic state, and phytoplankton biomass, of the environment. Zooplankton abundance and biomass showed a significant, positive correlation with these factors. Also the structure of zooplankton communities and their seasonal succession patterns were strongly associated with productivity potential. In general, the littoral zooplankton communities were characterized by higher diversity and abundance, and earlier succession patterns than previously reported for the northern Baltic pelagial.

Spatial and seasonal patterns of mercury concentrations in fish from the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Ontario: Implications for monitoring	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sediments of the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, are contaminated with mercury (Hg) due to industrial pollution. To better understand the risk to fish-consumers of Hg poisoning, patterns of Hg bioaccumulation in yellow perch were described at small spatial and temporal scales within a 10 km stretch of the river. Yellow perch (mathematically standardized to the average length of capture, 13.8 cm) from a contaminated upstream zone contained 2.3-3.6 times more mercury than fish from reference zones and a more contaminated zone only 2-3 km downstream. This was confirmed in two consecutive field seasons and with otherfish species. Mercury concentrations infish could not be accountedfor by differences among study sites in fish length, age, condition factor, or growth rate. However, there were seasonal changes in the variance of the log(Hg)-size relationship and in fish size and total Hg concentrations. Possible reasons for the observed patterns could include differences among sites in: food web complexity, prey contamination, fish bioenergetics and competition, local sources of Hg, or fish movements into and out of the areas of contamination. This study demonstrated that Hg in sediments is not a reliable basis for estimating human or ecological risks. Fish tissue analysis provides a clearer and more direct measure of exposure of human consumers. Similarly, annual programs of regional-scale monitoring may overlook local-scale contamination and the change in risks of Hg exposure due to seasonalfish movements.																			0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					72	85		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[72:SASPOM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[72:SASPOM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400006
J	LaBounty, JF; Burns, NM				LaBounty, JF; Burns, NM			Characterization of boulder basin, Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, USA - Based on analysis of 34 limnological parameters	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Mead is a 66,000 ha-deep subtropical reservoir located on the Colorado River, Nevada-Arizona. This largest U.S. reservoir by volume is limnologically complex with four inflows, three basins, plus variable seasonal and annual operational patterns. This investigation is about the most downstream basin, Boulder Basin. Thirty-four measured parameters are used to describe limnological conditions of Boulder Basin, including Las Vegas Bay, from 1990-2004. Some assessments use data sets from May 2000 to April 2004; other assessments use more extensive data sets spanning up to 14 years of records. Selected parameters, trends, basic and reservoir-specific processes, and limnologically important relationships are illustrated and discussed. Boulder Basin is well stratified and ecologically complex due to the existence of two interflows. A super- to mesotrophic gradient exists from the nutrient rich inner basin, which has inflow from an urban tributary, to the middle and outer basins, which become progressively less productive. Secchi depth increases, chlorophyll (Chl a), plankton abundance, conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) decrease going from the inner to outer basins. Lake Mead is strongly phosphorus (P)-limited and subject to a variety of algae blooms that depend on the presence and amounts of phosphorus. Due to ecological complexity, managing this resource is difficult and fraught with risk when conditions change. Along with the changing hydrologic conditions of the watershed that heavily influence Lake Mead, man-made products and toxin-producing algae are being introduced that need monitoring and management.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP	2005	21	3					277	307		10.1080/07438140509354435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354435													WOS:000232563600004

Influence of in situ temperature and maternal provisioning on the medusa-to-polyp transition in a year-round population of the scyphozoan Aurelia aurita	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												We investigated how environmental conditions translate into reproductive success or failure in Aurelia aurita from the medusa to the polyp life stage. This study examined how: (i) settlement success and development of planula larvae and polyps vary across the year, (ii) the role of temperature in determining the successful settlement of larvae and growth of polyps, and (iii) the influence of maternal provisioning in the successful settlement of larvae and growth of polyps. Medusae were collected monthly from February to December 2019 from Horsea Lake, UK. Planula larvae were settled in conditions mimicking the in situ temperature and salinity of collection. For the individual treatments, planula collected in August settled most rapidly. Early development rates (<8 tentacles) were significantly higher than later growth rates (>8 tentacles) and were positively correlated with temperature, unlike later growth rates. Planula length, used as an indicator of maternal provisioning, varied significantly across the year. In July 2019, a high temperature anomaly coincided with an increased time spent by planula larvae in the water column. Increasing temperatures past thermal limits through the increasing occurrence of temperature anomalies is likely to be detrimental to larval settlement and indirectly to the replenishment of temperate polyp populations.

J	Aguilera, F; Caro, J; Layana, S				Aguilera, Felipe; Caro, Javiera; Layana, Susana			The Evolution of Peteroa Volcano (Chile-Argentina) Crater Lakes Between 1984 and 2020 Based on Landsat and Planet Labs Imagery Analysis	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												One of the major challenges in the understanding of the crater lakes dynamics and their connection with magmatic/hydrothermal processes is the continuous tracking of the physical behavior of lakes, especially in cases of remote and poorly accessible volcanoes. Peteroa volcano (Chile-Argentina border) is part of the Planchon-Peteroa-Azufre Volcanic Complex, one of the three volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes with crater lakes. Peteroa volcano is formed by a similar to 5 km diameter caldera-type crater, which hosts four crater lakes and several fumarolic fields. Peteroa volcano has a large history of eruptive activity including phreatic-and-phreatomagmatic explosions and several episodes of strong degassing from its crater lakes. Here, we used TIR and SWIR bands from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images available from October 1984 to December 2020 to obtain thermal parameters such as thermal radiance, brightness temperature, and heat fluxes, and Planet Labs Inc. images (RapidEye and PlanetScope) available between May 2009 and December 2020 to obtain physical parameters such as area, color, and state (liquid or frozen) of the crater lakes. We reviewed the historical eruptive activity and compared it with thermal and physical data obtained from satellite images. We determined the occurrence of two eruptive/thermal cycles: 1) Cycle 1 includes the formation of a new fumarolic field and two active craters during a short eruptive period, which includes thermal activity in three of the four crater lakes, and a strong degassing process between October 1998 and February 2001, coincident with a peak of volcanic heat flux (Q(volc)) in two craters. The cycle finished with an eruptive episode (September 2010-July 2011). 2) Cycle 2 is represented by the thermal reactivation of two crater lakes, formation and detection of thermal activity in a new nested crater, and occurrence of a new eruptive episode (October 2018-April 2019). We observed a migration of the thermal and eruptive activity between the crater lakes and the interconnection of the pathways that feed the lakes, in both cases, partially related to the presence of two deep magma bodies. The Q(volc) in Peteroa volcano crater lakes is primarily controlled by volcanic activity, and seasonal effects affect it at short-term, whilst at long-term, seasonal effects do not show clear influences in the volcanic heat fluxes. The maximum Q(volc) measured between all crater lakes during quiescent periods was 59 MW, whereas during unrest episodes Q(volc) in single crater lakes varied from 7.1 to 38 MW, with Peteroa volcano being classified as a low volcanic heat flux system. The detection of new thermal activity and increase of Q(volc) in Peteroa volcano previous to explosive unrest can be considered as a good example of how thermal information from satellite images can be used to detect possible precursors to eruptive activity in volcanoes which host crater lakes.

The results show that the maximum annual capacities of COD, TP and TN are 768288.5t, 7161.2t and 143224t respectively by taking the second-class national water standard as reference and they are 1576982.5t, 14322.4t and 286448t respectively by taking the third-class national water standard as reference. The paper further analyzed the system adjusting capacity of water environment of Poyang Lake with the following results: The flood adjusting amount for the five upper rivers of Poyang Lake at their maximum inflow reaches 74 to 246x108 m3. The flood-adjustment rate is about 16 to 60 percent with its annual average adjustment rate of 34%. The occurrence of serious flooding disaster of Poyang Lake is 16%. The carrying capacity of the flooding-proof system of the lake region is relatively low. About 29.9 to 53x108 m3 water in the dry season are needed for maintaining ecological functions of the lake. Water and soil erosion, and land desertification in the lake region are not under control currently. Annual ecological and environmental cost reaches 19.85x108 RMB occupying 10.56 percent of the total GDP of the Poyang Lake region. In a word, the economic, social and environmental development coordinating level of the Poyang Lake region is low. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hamerlík, L; Bitusík, P				Hamerlik, Ladislav; Bitusik, Peter			The distribution of littoral chironomids along an altitudinal gradient in High Tatra Mountain lakes: Could they be used as indicators of climate change?	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												We studied assemblages of littoral chironomids from three alpine lakes in the High Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) along an altitude range of 1725-2157 m. The study sites were selected in order to emphasize differences in their thermal regimes. Littoral samples were taken quantitatively in the ice-free seasons of 2000 and 2001. In total, 3468 chironomid larvae and pupae were collected and 29 taxa were identified. Some parameters of the littoral chironomid assemblages showed clear patterns along the altitude gradient. The number of taxa and Shannon diversity increased markedly with decreasing altitude. Density, however, did not show any correlation with altitude. Even though gatherers highly dominated in all sites, their relative abundance decreased with decreasing altitude. The ratio of scrapers and predators correlated negatively with altitude. According to the results of a Detrended Correspondence Analysis, Pseudodiamesa arctica and Micropsectra radialis were chosen as indicator species for alpine lakes > 2000 in a.s.l. Typical subalpine lake inhabitants are Zavrelimyia sp., Prodiamesa olivacea, Corynoneura scutellata group, Cricotopus polaris, Micropsectra bavarica and Paratanytarsus austriacus. A single species, Micropsectra junci, seemed to be characteristic of alpine lakes < 2000 m a.s.l. This "gradient lake concept" could be used to predict changes in mountain lake fauna under expected climate change scenarios. Generally, an upward shift of subalpine species would be expected. The thermal regime of lakes, however, also depends on several local factors. Consequently, the schemes outlined here would not be valid for the entire Tatra lake district.					; Bitusik, Peter/C-3423-2019; Hamerlik, Ladislav/AAL-4735-2020	Hamerlik, Ladislav/0000-0002-0803-8981; Bitusik, Peter/0000-0002-8439-4582; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2009	45	3					145	156		10.1051/limn/2009021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2009021													WOS:000269888100002

TRENDS IN RESEARCH ON THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNING AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE MODELLING APPROACH	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Knowledge on the expected effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems is defined by three ways. On the one hand, long-term observation in the field serves as a basis for the possible changes; on the other hand, the experimental approach may bring valuable pieces of information to the research field. The expected effects of climate change cannot be studied by empirical approach; rather mathematical models are useful tools for this purpose. Within this study, the main findings of field observations and their implications for future were summarized; moreover, the modelling approaches were discussed in a more detailed way. Some models try to describe the variation of physical parameters in a given aquatic habitat, thus our knowledge on their biota is confined to the findings based on our present observations. Others are destined for answering special issues related to the given water body. Complex ecosystem models are the keys of our better understanding of the possible effects of climate change. Basically, these models were not created for testing the influence of global warming, rather focused on the description of a complex system (e. g. a lake) involving environmental variables, nutrients. However, such models are capable of studying climatic changes as well by taking into consideration a large set of environmental variables. Mostly, the outputs are consistent with the assumptions based on the findings in the field. Since synthetized models are rather difficult to handle and require quite large series of data, the authors proposed a more simple modelling approach, which is capable of examining the effects of global warming. This approach includes weather dependent simulation modelling of the seasonal dynamics of aquatic organisms within a simplified framework.					; Hufnagel, Levente/A-1773-2011	Hufnagel, Levente/0000-0003-0438-2432; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2009	7	2					171	198		10.15666/aeer/0702_171198	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/0702_171198													WOS:000270418100008

The stratigraphic position of the Mnico Interglacial has been controversial in the past. The identification of two volcanic ash layers and their microscopic analysis provides distinct marker layers for tephrochronological dating of these interglacial deposits. In addition to micro-facies analyses reconstructing depositional processes of both tephra layers within the lake environment, their mineralogical and geochemical composition has been determined through major-element electron probe micro-analysis on glass shards. Comparison with published tephra data traced the volcanic source regions of the Pianico tephras to the Campanian volcanic complex of Roccamonfina (Italy) and probably the Puy de Sancy volcano in the French Massif Central. Available dating of near-vent deposits from the Roccamonfina volcano provides a robust tephrochronological anchor point at around 400 ka for the Mnico Interglacial. These deposits correlate with marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 11 and thus are younger than Early to Middle Pleistocene previously suggested by K/Ar dating and older than the last interglacial as inferred from macrofloral remains and the geological setting.

Manganese content records seasonal upwelling in Lake Tanganyika mussels	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Biogenic productivity of Lake Tanganyika is highly dependent on seasonal upwellings of cold, oxygen-depleted, nutrient-rich deep waters. We investigated the shell of freshwater bivalve Pleiodon spekii as a geochemical archive of these periodic hydrological changes tuned by the monsoon regime. The results of a three-year-long limnological and geochemical survey of the coastal waters performed on the dissolved and particulate fractions were compared to LA-ICP-MS profiles of Mn in five aragonitic shells from the same lake location. Three shells present very similar Mn/Ca profiles dominated by a peak that matched the concomitant increase of Mn and chlorophyll a in surface waters during the 2002 upwelling, while a shell collected during 2003 dry season detect both 2002 and 2003 upwelling events. Larger shells showing an extremely reduced growth display more than 8 Mn/Ca peaks suggesting at least an 8-year-record of seasonal changes in water composition. We postulate that Mn/Ca in shells record the conjunction of an increase of biological activity with supplied of dissolved Mn and nutriments in coastal waters, resulting in an enhanced assimilation of biogenic Mn-rich particles. By combining the most recent generation of laser ablation system and the powerful High Resolution ICP-MS, the spatial resolution could be improved down to 5 to 10 Am crater size and end up in a better constrain of the relative variations of the annual Mn peaks. Such an approach on P. spekii from Lake Tanganyika has definitively a great potential to provide recent and past records on primary productivity associated with the monsoon climate system.					; Alleman, Laurent/T-2038-2019; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Andre, Luc/0000-0002-7286-0072; Alleman, Laurent/0000-0003-4165-1742; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2007	4	2					195	203		10.5194/bg-4-195-2007	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-4-195-2007													WOS:000246773400004
J	Anyah, RO; Semazzi, FHM				Anyah, RO; Semazzi, FHM			Simulation of the sensitivity of Lake Victoria basin climate to lake surface temperatures	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The response of Lake Victoria basin climate to changes in the lake surface temperatures (LST) has been examined using NCAR-Regional climate model (RegCM2). In the control run uniform lake surface temperature of 24 degreesC was prescribed and the model integrated for four months, starting at the beginning of September, 1988. In the anomaly experiments the LST was perturbed by +/- 1.5 degreesC, and kept constant during the entire period of the integrations. Simulation results show significant relationship between basin-wide spatial distribution of rainfall and changes in LST. In general during the short rains at warmer/cooler LSTs, significant increase/decrease in the simulated rainfall occurs over the lake surface and surrounding areas. Rainfall exceeding the amount in the control run by more than 50%, particularly over the western, south/southwestern and central parts of the lake is simulated in the run in which the LST is 1.5 degreesC warmer than the control. It is also evident from our results that different parts of the lake basin respond differently to LST changes which is in contrast to the common characterization of the lake basin as a single homogeneous climate regime in many previous studies. In general the results show that regions with largest response to LST anomalies during the short rains are collocated with the ITCZ. In October when the ITCZ is directly located over the lake, the largest response ( maximum rainfall) is also located over the same region. As the season progresses and the ITCZ shifts out of the lake into northern Tanzania, the regions of rainfall maxima also shift with it. This appears to explain the unexpected reduction in overlake rainfall in December in spite of the LST being warmer than control by 1.5 degreesC. We believe this is a direct consequence of the enhanced convection to the south of the lake (over ITCZ) and the tendency of the system to conserve local moisture budget over the lake.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2004	79	1-2					55	69		10.1007/s00704-004-0057-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-004-0057-4													WOS:000224615100006

Variation in nutrient removal in three wetland blocks in relation to vegetation composition, inflow nutrient concentration and hydraulic loading	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands provide vital ecosystem services such as water quality improvements, and are important sites of biodiversity conservation. Their optimal use and management depends, in part, on vegetation management and the quality and quantity of the water flowing through them. The South-finger wetland, situated on a Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust wetland visitor centre at Slimbridge, UK, receives waters of high nutrient concentrations from the wildfowl collection. The nutrient removal functioning of three constructed beds was compared and related to variations in input nutrient concentrations and hydraulic loading over I year (October 2005-October 2006). None of the beds removed nitrate, orthophosphate or total phosphorus over the year as a whole. The beds planted with Iris and mixed vegetation were found to remove the greatest proportion of ammonium, and increased nitrate concentrations in the water to a lesser extent than the Phragmites bed. Nutrient functioning in all three beds varied in a non-linear manner in relation to input nutrient concentrations and water residency time. Possible reasons for the differences in functioning between nitrogen and phosphorus, vegetation types and between seasons are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Diets, population structure, and seasonal activity patterns of mudpuppies (Necturus maculosus) in an urban, Great Lakes coastal habitat	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Freshwater species native to the Laurentian Great Lakes region face numerous environmental stressors, and the conservation status and ecological relationships of many remain poorly understood. One such species, the mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus), is declining, but better information on their natural history and development of more effective population monitoring techniques is needed. We assessed seasonal variation in capture success, biases in capture techniques, and feeding ecology of mudpuppies in Wolf Lake, a highly perturbed and urban former estuarine wetland complex to Lake Michigan. Trapping periods of >= 3 consecutive nights occurred from January to May 2015, and October 2015 to March 2016. Overall trapping success differed among trapping periods (p = 0.01) and declined precipitously at water temperatures above 14.1 degrees C (p < 0.001). Mudpuppies in traps (mean 26.9 +/- 0.5 cm) were larger than those caught with hand nets (mean 14.7 +/- 0.8 cm, p < 0.0001), suggesting that multiple methods may be needed to accurately assess demographics. Stomach contents obtained through gastric lavage included mollusks, leeches, insects, isopods, amphipods, crayfish, fish, a frog, and a juvenile conspecific. Invasive species, including rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and zebra/quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) were present in guts, suggesting mudpuppy foraging has changed along with aquatic communities in the region. Prey community analyses revealed differences in overall diet among size classes of mudpuppies (p = 0.001), but relatively weak similarity within size classes. Results suggest that mudpuppies in lake ecosystems occupy a broad niche that changes as they grow. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Feeding strategy of silverside species in eutrophic Lake Patzcuaro, Mexico	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The trophic guild, niche breadth, and trophic position of two different ontogenetic phases were measured according to the size of Chirostoma spp. captured in different zones of Lake Patzcuaro, Mexico. Analyses were carried out at the genus level due the difficulties to find diagnostic characters to separate the three small silverside species accurately, since even the molecular analyses of mitochondrial DNA for a subsample of the most morphologically differentiated specimens were conducted without success. Fish were captured with a seine net during the wet (September and November 2009) and dry (February and June 2010) seasons at four environmentally different sites. Gut contents of 480 Chirostoma specimens were divided into size-class intervals of 38-51mm and 66-71mm for analyses. The contribution of each food item was quantified using the frequency of occurrence and area percentage. Fish were categorized by size, and diets were compared between fish sizes and sites. Dorsal muscle tissue and zooplankton were obtained for nitrogen isotope signature (N-15) analyses. The trophic guild was determined using a modified quadrant method for gut content analysis; the importance of each prey item was estimated according to a modified index of relative importance. Niche breadth was calculated by the Levins' Index. The trophic position was assessed using the TrophLab Program and stable isotope analysis. The index of relative importance among study sites and fish size classes was determined by a multivariate approach. Silversides represent a secondary and tertiary consumer in Lake Patzcuaro that feed mainly on evasive prey, such as copepods (55%) and on non-evasive prey, such as cladocerans (25%) at sites with the lowest transparency in the water column (from 350mm to 150mm). Fish scales (11%) and insects (6%) were secondary food items. Ingestion of juvenile silversides was rare (1%). Chirostoma spp. prey on insects on the lake bottom and on water hyacinth roots. Based on N-15 analysis, the trophic position of silversides changes between wet and dry seasons. Their opportunistic and specialized predatory feeding strategy indicates the capability of silversides to resist anthropic changes in the lake.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Lakeshore marshes around Liangzi Lake, in the middle reach of the Yangtze River, China, experience annual changes of water level of c. 1.5 m. During the drawdown period, the vegetation is structured by helophytes and emergents; during the rainy season when the dams are closed (June-September) the marshes are flooded and their vegetation rapidly changes to be come dominated by submerged, floating-leaved and tall emergent species. The species composition and abundance of both the marsh seed bank and the vegetative propagule bank were compared with those of the drawdown and flooded vegetation types. These data provided a test of the predictive power of van der Valk's model of northern temperate seasonal vegetation change in a subtropical, freshwater wetland with cyclic vegetational change. The abundant species were detected in the propagule bank. The seed bank was found to determine the species richness of both types of the vegetation, whereas the vegetative propagule bank consisted of the dominants of the drawdown vegetation. Water depth conditions, and the composition of seed and vegetative propagules banks together determine the structure of the standing vegetation during drawdown and flooding. van der Valk's succession model was found to predict the seasonal vegetation change reasonably well. The Chi-square test showed no significant difference between predicted vegetation and actual vegetation in both drawdown and flooding periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

J	Townsend, SA				Townsend, SA			Hydraulic phases, persistent stratification, and phytoplankton in a tropical floodplain lake (Mary River, northern Australia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Mary River, in the Australian wet/dry tropics, flows seasonally. When the river ceases. owing in the dry season, a series of isolated lakes remain along the river's main floodplain channel. The limnology of a channel lake, which is 14 km long and 6-9 m deep in the dry season, was examined between April and December 2000. Four hydraulic phases were identified, these being (1) riverine (April), (2) riverine to lake transition (May), (3) lake (June-late-November), and (4) lake to riverine transition (late-November December). These phases differ with respect to their duration and flow direction from lakes located on tropical floodplains of perennially. owing rivers. Despite the variable hydraulic conditions, the main channel remained thermally stratified, with only infrequent and short-lived deep mixing events, and sufficient light for photosynthesis in the diurnal mixed layer. During the period of isolation and in contrast to floodplain lakes in tropical South America, the depth of the Mary River channel lake always exceeded, by at least 2-fold, the depth of the diurnal mixed layer. The water quality (conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, Si and water clarity) and phytoplankton assemblage of the channel lake was primarily driven by its hydraulics, though this was not evident for the channel's nutrient concentrations. Dissolved oxygen concentrations during lentic conditions were double values during the riverine and transition phases. This was attributed to the cessation of in. owing waters with a high biological oxygen demand, and enhanced photosynthetic activity of higher concentrations of phytoplankton retained under lentic conditions. The channel's phytoplankton assemblage reflected the channel's hydraulics, with the most common phytoplankton throughout the study period belonging to functional groups L-o (Peridinium inconspicuum), W1 (euglenoids), W2 (Trachelmonas) and Y (Cryptopmonas, Rhodomonas), with groups A (Acanthoceras) and D (Nitzschia agnita, Synedra alna) prominent during the lentic phase. Despite persistent strati. cation under lentic conditions, there was no clear evidence of autogenic succession or domination by any single phytoplankton functional group.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2006	556						163	179		10.1007/s10750-005-0885-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0885-y													WOS:000234198800013

Results showed that the water quality is gradually improving in this area, and the main pollutant indexes are chemical oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen. Cluster analysis divided the 12 months into two periods and the 25 monitoring sites into three groups based on similarity of water quality characteristics. The water quality of rainy seasons (July???December) was better than that of dry seasons (January???June). Groups 1, 2, and 3 were mainly located in the urban???rural fringe area, mountain area, and urban industrial park, respectively, representing moderate pollution, low pollution, and high pollution areas. Discriminant analysis (DA) presented good results with great discriminatory ability for both temporal and spatial analyses and provided an important data reduction. DA only used nine parameters for temporal analysis, affording approximately 91.7% correct assignations, and 18 parameters for spatial analysis, affording 96% correct assignations. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the four major pollution sources in the basin are industrial wastewater, agricultural runoff, domestic sewage, and livestock pollution. The research results are relevant to the prevention and control of water polluCity and the summary of the experience of winning the battle of pollution prevention and control in China take the lead in implementing the municipal river chief system in Sichuan Province.

Diversity and composition of macroinvertebrate communities in a rare inland salt marsh	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Inland salt marshes are rare habitats in the Great Lakes region of North America, formed on salt deposits from the Silurian period. These patchy habitats are abiotically stressful for the freshwater invertebrates that live there, and provide an opportunity to study the relationship between stress and diversity. We used morphological and COI metabarcoding data to assess changes in diversity and composition across both space (a transect from the salt seep to an adjacent freshwater area) and time (three sampling seasons). Richness was significantly lower at the seep site with both datatypes, while metabarcoding data additionally showed reduced richness at the freshwater transect end, consistent with a pattern where intermediate levels of stress show higher diversity. We found complementary, rather than redundant, patterns of community composition using the two datatypes: not all taxa were equally sequenced with the metabarcoding protocol. We identified taxa that are abundant at the salt seep of the marsh, including biting midges (Culicoides) and ostracods (Heterocypris). We conclude that (as found in other studies) molecular and morphological work should be used in tandem to identify the biodiversity in this rare habitat. Additionally, salinity may be a driver of community membership in this system, though further ecological research is needed to rule out alternate hypotheses.																			2045-7758					NOV	2021	11	21					14351	14365		10.1002/ece3.8222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8222		OCT 2021						34765111					WOS:000709159000001

We compared the baseline phosphorus (P) concentrations inferred by diatom-P transfer functions and export coefficient models at 62 lakes in Great Britain to assess whether the techniques produce similar estimates of historical nutrient status. 2. There was a strong linear relationship between the two sets of values over the whole total P (TP) gradient (2-200 mu g TP L-1). However, a systematic bias was observed with the diatom model producing the higher values in 46 lakes (of which values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1 in 21). The export coefficient model gave the higher values in 10 lakes (of which the values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1 in only 4). 3. The difference between baseline and present-day TP concentrations was calculated to compare the extent of eutrophication inferred by the two sets of model output. There was generally poor agreement between the amounts of change estimated by the two approaches. The discrepancy in both the baseline values and the degree of change inferred by the models was greatest in the shallow and more productive sites. 4. Both approaches were applied to two lakes in the English Lake District where long-term P data exist, to assess how well the models track measured P concentrations since approximately 1850. There was good agreement between the pre-enrichment TP concentrations generated by the models. The diatom model paralleled the steeper rise in maximum soluble reactive P (SRP) more closely than the gradual increase in annual mean TP in both lakes. The export coefficient model produced a closer fit to observed annual mean TP concentrations for both sites, tracking the changes in total external nutrient loading. 5. A combined approach is recommended, with the diatom model employed to reflect the nature and timing of the in-lake response to changes in nutrient loading, and the export coefficient model used to establish the origins and extent of changes in the external load and to assess potential reduction in loading under different management scenarios. 6. However, caution must be exercised when applying these models to shallow lakes where the export coefficient model TP estimate will not include internal P loading from lake sediments and where the diatom TP inferences may over-estimate TP concentrations because of the high abundance of benthic taxa, many of which are poor indicators of trophic state.					; Johnes, Penny/D-1381-2009; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019	Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; Johnes, Penny/0000-0003-1605-6896; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2005	50	10					1651	1670		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01428.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01428.x													WOS:000231860600007
J	Taguchi, K; Nakata, K				Taguchi, Koichi; Nakata, Kisaburo			Evaluation of biological water purification functions of inland lakes using an aquatic ecosystem model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												An effective measure to cope with eutrophication of lakes is to remove nutrients that can cause algal blooming by taking advantage of natural water purification processes. Here the term "purification" is defined, in a wide sense, as the potential role of a water body to contribute to the reduction of pollutants and thus controlling eutrophication. Also regarded as a kind of ecological regulating services, biological purification involves various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation, such as uptake by aquatic macrophytes, biofouling onto foliage substrates. feeding by organisms in higher trophic level, and eternal loss or removal of substance from the water. In order to evaluate the water purification ability, a numerical lake ecosystem model highlighting the role of macrophyte colonies in the shore zone was developed and applied to Lakes Suwa, Kasumi and Biwa, as well as five small lakes attached to Lake Biwa. The model includes the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phyto- and zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, pelagic fish and nutrients) and benthic compartments (macrophytes, epiphytic algae, phytal animals, macro- and megalobenthos, and demersal fish). Under dynamic forcing of meteorological and hydrological parameters, the model was run over a year to evaluate the annual nutrient cycles and purification functions. The reproducibility of the model was validated for each water body by comparison with the field data from the water quality monitoring campaign. Numerical results revealed that the water purification ability, from viewpoints of both stock and flux, generally tends to be higher in the shore region than in the offshore region owing to a wide variety of aquatic biota. Moreover, it increases almost in proportion to the density of vegetation in the shore region. Nutrient fluxes representing the purification processes turned out to be closely connected with the surface area or equivalently with the retention time of the water bodies, suggesting that biological purification does not become dominant against physical turnover until the surface area reaches around 10(3) ha or the retention time exceeds the order of 10(2) days.

In general, reproductive activities resulted in significantly lower levels of body condition in three-spined stickleback during the latter part of the breeding season, and relatively high levels of S. solidus infection intensified the energetic drain. Although female body condition did not differ significantly due just to the presence of S. solidus, increased parasite index did have a significant negative effect on female body condition. Males showed significantly lower levels of body condition in response to S. solidus infection alone and in association with a greater parasite index. Males had greater mean parasite indices than females. Females had significantly lower body condition than males, which may be due to discrepancies in energy expenditure between the sexes during reproduction. Females with greater body condition were significantly more likely to produce a clutch of eggs than those with lower condition, suggesting a threshold effect of body condition on reproductive capacity.

Does condition of Lake Whitefish spawners affect physiological condition of juveniles?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent declines in growth and condition of several Great Lakes lake whitefish populations have raised concerns over potential impacts on juvenile physiological condition and ultimately recruitment. To test whether the condition of spawning adults influences juvenile condition via energy allocation dynamics, we partitioned the variation in age 0 juvenile physiological condition (i.e., growth in length and weight, whole-body moisture content, energy density, and protein content) among adult male and female (i.e., body condition, muscle moisture content, energy density, and protein content) and egg (i.e., wet and dry weight, moisture content, energy density, energy content per egg, and protein content) effects using redundancy analysis. Overall, a model that included sampling site, female condition, and egg quality explained 39% of the variation in juvenile physiological condition. After partitioning out the effects of females and eggs, site explained the most variation (23%). When other factors were accounted for, neither females (1.4%) nor eggs (2.7%) explained much variation in juvenile physiological condition. Of the variables studied, female muscle energy density, muscle moisture content, and egg moisture content were most closely associated with juvenile physiological condition. Our results suggest that parental effects, such as size, age, body condition, or body composition, may not be as important as extrinsic site-related effects or density-dependent effects in determining juvenile physiological condition.

J	Martino, RL				Martino, Ronald L.			Sequence stratigraphy of fluvially-dominated strata of the Mid-Late Pennsylvanian Conemaugh Formation, Central Appalachian Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Sequence stratigraphic analysis of nonmarine, fluvially-dominated strata is particularly challenging compared to paralic and marine sequences due to rapid facies changes and limited lateral continuity of key beds. The Conemaugh Formation of central West Virginia is a prime example of this type of stratigraphic interval. This study describes the stratigraphy and sedimentary fades from 68 outcrops in the lower 100 m of the Mid-Late Pennsylvanian, nonmarine Conemaugh Formation in this area. Fades identified include 1) fluvial-upper estuarine channel sandstones, 2) crevasse splay channel and sheet sandstones, 3) lacustrine shale, mudstone, and claystone, 4) lacustrine/palustrine limestone, 5) paludal coal and carbonaceous shale, and 6) hackly mudstone and claystone paleosols. Mature, polygenetic, high-chroma calcic vertisols and calcisols are the regionally developed interfluvial sequence boundaries (IFSBs) of seven fourth-order sequences (major cyclothems) between the Upper Freeport and Harlem coal horizons. Initial paleosol development occurred under well-drained conditions and strongly seasonal, semiarid-arid climate approaching and during glacial maxima at a time of minimal accommodation space on the interfluves. Subsequent rising water table associated with rising base level occurred as interglacial sea level rose and the climate became less seasonal and more humid. This initially led to deposition of thin, carbonaceous mud and peat followed by lacustrine and palustrine limestones. The presence of spirorbid microconchids indicates that the lakes were at least intermittently connected to the sea, which reached to within 50-80 km of all outcrops in the study during five transgressions. The tops of these limestones represent maximum flooding surfaces. They are overlain by coarsening-upward lake-fill sequences formed during high accommodation on the interfluves during the HST. A nonmarine sequence stratigraphic model and a polygenetic paleosol model are proposed for the Conemaugh in central West Virginia. This study underscores the importance of recognizing regionally developed IFSB paleosols and microconchid limestones in correlation and sequence stratigraphic analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For the first time, the formation factor F, which combines the effect of tortuosity and porosity on diffusion, was quantified in freshwater sediments at submillimeter resolution. Sediment cores were treated with KCl and F was determined using a resistivity sensor and K+ selective electrodes. F was determined in sediments from different water depths of the eutrophic Lake Zug (Switzerland): In sandy sediments from a shallow site (12 in depth), F increased by approximately 50% within a few millimeters below the sediment surface. In clayey and silty sediments from the oxic (<80 in depth) and seasonally anoxic (80-120 in depth) zones of the lake, the initial increase in F was only 20%. In the permanent anoxic zone (>160 in depth), F increased by only 10% just below the sediment surface. Values of F were correlated with the porosity at each depth. We found close correlations of F = 1.02 (.) phi (-1.81) for clay-silt sediments, and F = 1.04 (.) phi(-1.21) for sandy sediments. The exponents are considerably smaller in Lake Zug than found for marine sediments, thus, diffusive transport seems to be less affected by tortuosity in this freshwater system.

To assess how different management approaches maintained large herbivore populations, we conducted line distance surveys and estimated seasonal densities of elephant, giraffe, zebra, and wildebeest in six management units, including three CBCMs, two national parks (positive controls), and one area with little conservation interventions (negative control). Using a Monte-Carlo approach to propagate uncertainties from the density estimates and trend analysis, we analyzed the resulting time series (2011-2019). Densities of the target species were consistently low in the site with little conservation interventions. In contrast, densities of zebra and wildebeest in CBCMs were similar to national parks, providing evidence that CBCMs contributed to the stabilization of these migratory populations in the central part of the ecosystem. CBCMs also supported giraffe and elephant densities similar to those found in national parks. In contrast, the functional connectivity of Lake Manyara National Park has not been augmented by CBCMs. Our analysis suggests that CBCMs can effectively conserve large herbivores, and that maintaining connectivity through CBCMs should be prioritized.

Quantitative field sampling was conducted at eight sites (lakes and streams) in South Korea, and toxicity tests were conducted on 48-h lethal and effective concentrations (LC50 and EC50) of road deicer (CaCl2 74 %) and high-grade CaCl2 (96 %) on five selected macroinvertebrate species (Gammarus sobaegensis, Caridina denticulata denticulata, Glyptotendipes tokunagai, Cloeon dipterum, and Ecdyonurus levis). Although Cl- concentrations were significantly different between the seasons (before and after snowfall) at most of the study sites, community values (species richness, density, dominance index, and diversity index) were not significantly different between the seasons. In the bioassay, 2.85 g L-1 CaCl2 elicited abnormal swimming behavior of test organisms based on EC50 values. The LC50 values of the five test species ranged from 3.54 to 20.73 g L-1. For all tested species, the LC50 of road deicer was higher than that of high-grade CaCl2. This study shows that despite the heavy application of road deicers during the snowy season, the deicer may not directly affect benthic macroinvertebrate communities over short time periods because Cl- concentrations in the field sites (<0.025 g L-1) were much lower than the LC50 values. Because the quantity of deicers used in this region continues to increase, long-term research into the effects of deicers on benthic macroinvertebrates is needed.					; Kim, Dong/U-8018-2017; Baek, Min Jeong/GWC-8998-2022	Cho, Kijong/0000-0002-7215-8945; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2014	225	6							1961	10.1007/s11270-014-1961-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-1961-6													WOS:000338334200008

Temporal evolution and vertical stratification of Microcystis toxic potential during a first bloom event	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												In order to study the setup of a Microcystis bloom and the evolution of its toxic potential, we studied the temporal and vertical variations in Microcystis aeruginosa abundance, microcystins (MC) concentrations (intracellular and extracellular), and the relative proportion of potentially microcystin-producing cells (MC-producing cells) in relation to physicochemical parameters in the recently setup Moroccan reservoir "Yaacoub Al Mansour." The Microcystis bloom appeared relatively late in the season and was associated with a low proportion of MC-producing cells in the water surface layer, probably related to non-limiting nutrient concentrations. Interestingly, the setup of the bloom leads to a vertical gradient, showing a decrease in Microcystis cell abundance inversely coupled with an increase in the proportion of MC-producing cells. Thus, this can be the result of the growth where non-MC-producing cells remain in the lighted water layer easier than MC-producing ones. Nevertheless, parameters other than light intensity may influence the toxic potential of bloom as no vertical pattern was observed concerning microcystins cellular quotas. The high microcystins concentrations measured in the deep water layer have also proved the importance of considering the deep part of aquatic ecosystem in the management of health risks associated with cyanobacterial proliferations.

Variable effects of climate and density on the juvenile ecology of two salmonids in an Alaskan lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Despite concerns over rapidly warming temperatures, an empirical understanding of climatic impacts on wild salmonid populations is limited. We tested how temperature and density affected juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) using a 31 year census from an Alaskan lake. There were positive effects of temperature on overall salmon biomass, sockeye biomass, and the length of age 2 sockeye smolts. There was, however, little evidence for relationships between temperature or length of growing season and coho biomass, coho length, smolts per spawner (both species), and age structure (both species). In some cases there were temporal changes contrary to what is generally expected in a warming Alaskan lake with longer growing seasons (e. g., increasing proportions of age 2 smolts). Intraspecific density was negatively related to sockeye length at out-migration, but there was no evidence for relationships between density and other response variables. Overall, patterns observed here and in other studies emphasize that responses to climatic variation can vary substantially across locations, between similar species occupying the same habitats, and among alternative life history strategies within populations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2014	71	6					799	807		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0577													WOS:000337106500002

Changing patterns of carbon allocation in lake phytoplankton: an FTIR analysis	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to assess carbon allocation in selected phytoplankton (Pediastrum duplex, Ceratium hirundinella, Anabaena flos-aquae) in a eutrophic lake. In contrast to bulk-analysis techniques, FTIR spectroscopy can provide information on carbon allocation at the species level within natural mixed populations. Carbon allocation was determined using lipid/protein (L/P) and carbohydrate/protein (C/P) ratios and multivariate analysis of complete spectra and showed considerable intraspecific heterogeneity within samples dates, and clear seasonal changes in the spectra of Pediastrum and Anabaena, with both alga showing increased L/P and C/P ratios on selected sampling dates. Although increased ratios can indicate nutrient deficiency, the alga were not nutrient deficient during these periods, as indicated by continued population growth and high (> 0.1%) internal phosphorus concentrations. FTIR spectra from Ceratium did not show any clear seasonal change. In all three algae, the transition from population growth to decline was not accompanied by any significant change in ratios, nor were low epilimnetic nutrients correlated with increased ratios, marking a significant contrast to laboratory batch cultures (previous studies) where low nutrients and the transition to stationary phase led to marked spectral changes.

Understanding how population dynamics fluctuated in such species throughout periods of past climatic change can provide insight into this issue. The drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) is a large-bodied rainforest adapted mammal found in West Central Africa. In the middle of this endangered monkey's geographic range is Lake Barombi Mbo, which has a well-documented palynological record of environmental change that dates to the Late Pleistocene. We used a Bayesian coalescent-based framework to analyze 2,076 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA across wild drill populations to infer past changes in female effective population size since the Late Pleistocene. Our results suggest that the drill underwent a nearly 15-fold demographic collapse in female effective population size that was most prominent during the Mid Holocene (approximately 3-5 Ka). This time period coincides with a period of increased dryness and seasonality across Africa and a dramatic reduction in forest coverage at Lake Barombi Mbo. We believe that these changes in climate and forest coverage were the driving forces behind the drill population decline. Furthermore, the warm temperatures and increased aridity of the Mid Holocene are potentially analogous to current and future conditions faced by many tropical rainforest communities. In order to prevent future declines in population size in rainforest-adapted species such as the drill, large tracts of forest should be protected to both preserve habitat and prevent forest loss through aridification.					; Astaras, Christos/AAP-4186-2020; Raaum, Ryan/B-4609-2008	Corush, Joel/0000-0001-8192-4691; Astaras, Christos/0000-0002-8503-217X; Phillips, Naomi/0000-0003-4797-2598; 													2045-7758					MAR	2012	2	3					550	561		10.1002/ece3.98	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.98								22822434					WOS:000312443300007

Holocene climate evolution and human activity as recorded by the sediment record of lake Diss Mere, England	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Lake sediments are ideal archives to evaluate the interactions between climatically driven environmental responses and human activity on seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. This study focuses on the unique sediments of Diss Mere, the only lake in England providing an annually laminated (varved) record for most of the Holocene. We combine microfacies analysis with X-ray core scanning data to explore the influence of natural and human-led changes on sediment deposition over the past 10 200 years and evaluate the sensitivity of the lake sediments to climate variability through time. Variability of titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca) and silica (Si) explain most of the lithological changes observed in the sediment and we identify three stages with low (10 290-2070 cal a bp), intermediate (2070-1040 cal a bp) and intensified (1040 cal a bp - present) human influence. During the first stage, where varved sediments are preserved, Ti is low due to the minimal detrital input into the lake. Ca and Si during this stage reveal high-amplitude variability responding to seasonal changes in sediment deposition. The termination of varved sediment preservation and increases in sedimentation rates coincide with a major rise in Ti after this first stage, marking the intensification of human activity around the lake. Ca is used here as an indicator of temperature-included calcite precipitation, and the long-term variability of the Ca profile resembles Holocene temperature evolution. This continues during periods of intensified human activity, suggesting that the Diss Mere sediments remain sensitive to climate through time.

The development of paleoclimatic reconstructions largely relies on the invention and application of proper quantitative/semi-quantitative temperature and salinity proxies. Over the last few decades, alkenones have shown great potential as indicators of the past temperatures and salinities of lakes on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Several alkenone-based temperature and salinity records have confirmed centennial warm-dry and cold-wet variations during the Holocene on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Herein, we present alkenone-based records from Lake Tuosu in the Qaidam Basin over the last similar to 1200 years. The alkenone signals show similar characteristics to published alkenone records in the nearby region during centennial warm periods (the Medieval Warm Period and Current Warm Period). However, the alkenones from Lake Tuosu demonstrate abnormally warm and saline signals during centennial cold periods (mainly during the Little Ice Age), in contrast to the widely recognized cold-wet conditions in the Qaidam Basin. Accordingly, the alkenone records from Lake Tuosu provide an exceptional case for the application of alkenones. The abnormally warm and saline alkenone signals from Lake Tuosu during centennial cold periods cannot be explained by either the presence of the C-37:3 alkenone isomer or seasonal bias in alkenone production. Changes in species composition might be an alternative reason for this, which requires a further investigation of the sources of alkenones in lakes in the future.

J	Chen, B; Xu, B				Chen, Bin; Xu, Bing			A Novel Method for Measuring Landscape Heterogeneity Changes	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												In this letter, we present a novel efficient automated tracing algorithm, called Compound Ray Recorder (CRR), to measure landscape heterogeneity efficiently without any supporting data sets. The main advantages of this method are: 1) the definition of a unified calculation framework for landscape heterogeneity is proposed and 2) no ancillary data are required, and the whole procedure can be automatically performed without any expert support or subjective evaluation. The results of tests using the proposed CRR method with actual satellite data show that it can accurately quantify the level of heterogeneity of a variety of landscapes. By normalizing the image size, the method constructs a unified framework for comparison of different regions or image extents. Meanwhile, the CRR method has been applied to time-series tracing of urban expansion and seasonal changes in the Poyang Lake area, thereby providing a new approach for monitoring landscape changes. Furthermore, heterogeneity changes mapping, and quantitative comparisons between the proposed method and existing methods are also performed.					; Chen, Bin/ABD-5074-2021; Xu, Bing/C-7732-2015	Xu, Bing/0000-0001-9159-2512; Chen, Bin/0000-0003-3496-2876; 													1545-598X	1558-0571				MAR	2015	12	3					567	571		10.1109/LGRS.2014.2351575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2014.2351575													WOS:000344988800026

Water samples were collected and analyzed to study spatial and temporal water quality variation. Strong seasonal variation of water quality was found. The water quality of Bang Lake was relatively poor compared to Sha and Dahu Lakes in the wet season, but better in the normal season. During the dry season, the water quality of Bang Lake is negatively affected by the activity of migratory birds. According to the correlation analysis of monthly concentrations of each parameter, the concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, and NO3--N were highly correlated. The correlation index was 0.829 and significance index was 0.042 < 0.05. From north to south within Bang Lake, the concentration of TN decreased; however, the concentration of Chl-a increased. From east to west within Bang Lake, concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and Chl-a increased. The Xiu and Gan Rivers influence the water quality of Bang Lake, especially in the northeast area of the lake. The water quality of Bang Lake only reached Chinese water quality standard level IV or V according to a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The evaluation factors impacting Bang Lake are TN>TP>NH4+-N>COD, in order of decreasing importance. The waters of Poyang Lake Migratory Bird Sanctuary have been polluted; one of the important contributing factors was migratory birds' disturbance and feces.

A Risk Assessment Approach to Manage Inundation of Elseya albagula Nests in Impounded Waters: A Win-Win Situation?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A risk assessment process was used to trial the impact of potential new operating rules on the frequency of nest inundation for the White-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula, in the impounded waters of the Burnett River, Queensland, Australia. The proposed operating rules would increase the barrage storage level during the turtle nesting season (May-July) and then would be allowed to reduce to a lower level for incubation for the rest of the year. These proposed operating rules reduce rates of nest inundation by altering water levels in the Ben Anderson Barrage impoundment of the Burnett River. The rules operate throughout the turtle reproductive period and concomitantly improve stability of littoral habitat and fishway operation. Additionally, the proposed rules are expected to have positive socio-economic benefits within the region. While regulated water resources will inherently have a number of negative environmental implications, these potential new operating rules have the capacity to benefit the environment while managing resources in a more sustainable manner. The operating rules have now been enacted in subordinate legislation and require the operator to maintain water levels to minimize turtle nest inundation.					; McDougall, Andrew/AAA-8657-2019	McDougall, Andrew/0000-0003-3304-984X; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				MAR	2015	55	3					715	724		10.1007/s00267-014-0411-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0411-y								25432451					WOS:000350368300015

CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Propagules dispersal and colonization ability are major issues of macrophyte regeneration. For submerged macrophyte Potamogeton crispus L., turion dispersal along water flow can favor the long-distance expansion of its population; therefore, it is crucial to investigate factors that affect turion dispersal. For this purpose, we studied effects of buoyancy and season on dispersal P. crispus turions by collecting field samples from Taihu Lake, over a three-months period (turion-formatting season, from May to July). Germination experiments (30 days in each sampling month) revealed that the floating turions germinated earlier and faster than the sinking ones across the three sampling months. After germination, the floating turions showed higher seedling height; whereas the sinking turions accumulated more sprouts biomass. The soluble sugar, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were found higher in the floating turions. The starch concentrations remained high without buoyancy or season effects. These results indicate that both internal (e.g., buoyancy, soluble sugar, TN, and TP concentrations) and external environmental factors (e.g., light condition and temperature) may contribute to germinability and plant growth of P. crispus turions. This study offers new insights into the dispersal of asexual propagules of submerged macrophytes.																			1863-0650	1863-0669				MAR	2015	43	3					324	329		10.1002/clen.201300833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201300833													WOS:000351398800002
J	Hinman, SE; Brewer, JS				Hinman, Sarah E.; Brewer, J. Stephen			Responses of two frequently-burned wet pine savannas to an extended period without fire	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Ecosystems that naturally burn at short intervals nonetheless exhibit some variability in fire-return intervals. Prolonged fire suppression and exclusion, however, potentially increase this variability beyond some tolerable threshold. Therefore frequent fires at regular intervals are often argued as necessary to maintain herbaceous plant diversity in pine savannas. We measured plant community composition after eight- and nine-year fire-free intervals, preceded by 15 years of fires every three years, at two wet pine savanna sites (Wolf Branch and Sandy Creek) in southern Mississippi. Species composition was quantified after the frequent-fire period (1997), after eight years without fire at Sandy Creek and nine years without fire at Wolf Branch, and for two seasons after a prescribed bum in 2004 at both sites. Monte Carlo randomization tests revealed significant changes in species composition at both study sites. However, most changes were temporary. Numerous herbaceous species appeared to be significantly less common at the end of the fire-free interval, but this decline was reversed by the 2004 fire. Only Eriocaulon compressum, Dichromena latifolia, Polygala cruciata, and Rhexia lutea declined and remained infrequent after the 2004 fire. A few herbaceous species (e.g., Aristida palustris, Zigadenus glaberrimus, and Carphephorus pseudoliatris) benefited from the fire-free interval. The majority of long-lived species responded with increased flowering after the fire, and in some cases, increased flowering was delayed until the second growing season after fire. We conclude that most species in wet pine savannas can withstand periodic extended intervals between fires, and a few may even benefit from such variability. We suggest that adaptations such as fire-regulated dormancy and plasticity enable most plants in this system to tolerate naturally varying fire frequencies.																			1095-5674					OCT-DEC	2007	134	4					512	526		10.3159/07-RA-005.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3159/07-RA-005.1													WOS:000253387600009

Diatom-salinity relationships in wetlands: assessing the influence of salinity variability on the development of inference models	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatoms are among the most widely used indicators of human and climate induced wetland salinity history in the world. This is particularly as a result of the development of diatom-based models for inferring past salinity. These models have primarily been developed from relationships between diatoms and salinity measured at the time of sampling or during the preceding year. Although within site variation in salinity has the potential to reduce the efficacy of such models, its influence has been rarely considered. Hence, diatom-conductivity relationships in eight seasonally monitored wetlands have been investigated. In developing a diatom-conductivity transfer function from these sites, we sought to assess the influence of conductivity variation on diatom inference model performance. Our sites were characterised by variability in conductivity that was not correlated to its range and thus were well suited to an investigation of this type. We found, contrary to expectations, that short-term (seasonal) changes in conductivity which were often dramatic did not result in unduly reduced transfer function performance. By contrast, sites that were more variable in the medium term (5-6 years) tended to have larger model errors. In addition, we identified a secondary ecological gradient in the diatom data which could not be related to any measured variable (including pH, turbidity or nutrient concentrations).

J	Hightower, JE; Jackson, JR; Pollock, KH				Hightower, JE; Jackson, JR; Pollock, KH			Use of telemetry methods to estimate natural and fishing mortality of striped bass in Lake Gaston, North Carolina	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Natural mortality can substantially affect fish population dynamics, but the rate is difficult to estimate because natural deaths are rarely observed and it is difficult to separate the effects of natural and fishing mortality on abundance. We developed a new telemetry approach for estimating natural and fishing mortality rates and applied it to the population of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Gaston, North Carolina and Virginia. Our analyses were based on a sample size of 51 telemetered striped bass that were known to be alive and in Lake Gaston at least 1 month after capture and surgery. Relocations of live fish and fish that died of natural causes were used to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates and the probability of relocating telemetered fish. Fishing mortality rates varied seasonally, but few natural deaths were observed, so the best model incorporated a constant annual instantaneous natural mortality rate (M; +/- SE) of 0.14 +/- 0.02. With the uncertainty in model selection accounted for, the average annual M was 0.16 +/- 0.04 For 1997 and 0.12 +/- 0.04 for 1998. Estimated annual fishing mortality rates (F) were 0.74 +/- 0.13 for 1997 and 0.34 +/- 0.18 for 1998. This telemetry approach for estimating mortality rates does not rely on angler reporting of tagged fish. The relative standard errors for;M (24-33%) were comparable to those obtained from traditional ragging methods with large sample sizes. This approach is most applicable in closed systems, where fishing mortality estimates are not biased by emigration. A high relocation probability is critical to reliably establishing seasonal changes in mortality.					; Hightower, Joseph/O-5867-2019	Hightower, Joseph/0000-0001-7208-7764; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2001	130	4					557	567		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0557:UOTMTE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0557:UOTMTE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169852700003

Incorporating vertical movement of fishes in habitat use models	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Fish telemetry studies now routinely collect positional and depth data, yet analytical approaches that integrate three-dimensional data are limited. Here we apply the potential path volume (PPV) model, a method previously developed to estimate habitat volume based on rates of avian movement, to free-swimming fish. Using a telemetry dataset of white sucker (Catastomus commersonii) from Turkey Lake (Ontario, Canada), we evaluated the effects of the number of spatial positions and different methods of selecting swim speed (vswim), a key parameter for PPV models, on habitat volume estimates. We subsequently compared habitat volume estimates and habitat overlap among white sucker pairs from the PPV models to those calculated using kernel utilization distribution-based approaches. The number of spatial positions in the PPV model had a significant effect on habitat volume estimates, whereas the magnitude of the vswim parameter or its specificity (constant value vs. fish-season specific parameter values) did not affect habitat volume estimates. The PPV method resulted in larger habitat volume estimates and greater habitat overlap estimates among fish pairs relative to those obtained from a three-dimensional kernel utilization distribution method. The PPV model is a useful analytical tool that, by incorporating potential animal movement into habitat use evaluations, can help answer key ecological questions and provide insight into fish space use in a wide range of conservation and management applications.

However, the lack of long-term records of lake production and anoxia in this region makes it difficult to discriminate the impacts of recent anthropogenic activity on lake ecosystems from natural ecosystem variability. This study investigates varved sediments from remote maar Lake Xiaolongwan, NE China and reconstructs high-resolution changes in lake primary production, anoxia, nutrient cycling and catchment processes over the past 1500 years using hyperspectral imaging inferred sedimentary total chlorophyll-a and bacteriopheophytin-a (Bphe-a), combined with sedimentary iron and phosphorus fractions data. Results show that, prior to discernible human impacts in this area from similar to 600 CE to 1900 CE, lake primary production was higher during warm periods and reduced during cold periods. Bphe-a records show that hypolimnetic anoxia persisted regardless of temperature variability. Cluster analysis suggests that lake algal communities and biogeochemical conditions in the twentieth-century warm period are unprecedented and significantly different from any other time over the past 1500 years. This phenomenon mostly results from global warming and stronger local catchment disturbance in the early 1900s, combined with atmospheric pollution after the 1950s. Human-driven climate warming has caused stronger seasonal mixing (due to shortened ice-cover duration) and overall better oxygenation in the lake. This study demonstrates clear anthropogenic impacts to lake ecosytems in a relatively pristine region in NE China. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for understanding the status of aquatic ecosystems in NE China under future interacting stressors of anthropogenic climate warming and pollution.

First lacustrine application of the diatom-bound nitrogen isotope paleo-proxy reveals coupling of denitrification and N2 fixation in a hyper-eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Past changes in the input/output, and internal cycling, of bioavailable nitrogen (N) in marine and lacustrine environments can be reconstructed by analyzing the N isotopic composition (delta N-15) of organic matter in the sedimentary record. To verify, and eliminate, potential biases of bulk sedimentary delta N-15 (delta N-15(bulk)) signatures by diagenetic alteration and external N inputs, we applied, for the first time, the diatom-bound N isotope (delta N-15(db)) paleo-proxy to lake sediments. By comparing delta N-15(bulk) and delta N-15(db) in a sedimentary record from eutrophic Lake Lugano (Switzerland), we demonstrate that changing redox conditions influence the degree of N-isotopic alteration of the bulk sediment, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting delta N-15(bulk) in paleolimnological studies. Furthermore, in combining delta N-15(db) measurements with X-ray fluorescence scanning and state-of-the-art molecular biomarker analyses, we reconstruct nutrient cycling and paleoenvironmental conditions in the lake over the past similar to 125 yr. Coeval with the period of severe eutrophication in Lake Lugano in the 1960s, our proxy data indicate that export production, delta N-15(db), and the concentration of heterocyst glycolipids (a biomarker for N-2-fixing cyanobacteria) increased simultaneously. Together, these data suggest that the rise in delta N-15(db) is likely the result of enhanced water-column denitrification in response to increased phytoplankton productivity. We hypothesize that greater export production during eutrophication led to anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion as a result of enhanced organic matter remineralization, raising water-column denitrification. Enhanced N loss and remobilization of phosphorous (P) from the sediments under anoxic conditions lowered the N : P ratio in the lake, fostering cyanobacterial N-2 fixation in surface waters.

The most frequently reported cyanotoxins are the microcystins, which threaten the health of humans, wildlife, and ecosystems. Determining the potential for microcystin production is hindered by a lack of morphological features that correlate with microcystin production. However, amplicon-based methods permit the detection of microcystin biosynthesis genes and were employed to assess the toxin potential in Lake Utopia, NB, Canada, an oligotrophic lake that occasionally experiences cyanobacteria blooms. Samples collected at 2 week intervals from June 27th to September 27th, 2016, were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the microcystin synthetase E gene (mcyE). The mcyE gene was present in some samples every sampling day, despite microcystin not being detected via ELISA, and was most frequently associated with the larger pore size fractions of the serially filtered samples. Further PCR surveys using primer sets to amplify genus-specific (e.g., Microcystis, Anabaena/Dolichospermum, and Planktothrix) mcyE fragments identified Microcystis as the only taxa in Lake Utopia with toxigenic potential. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region revealed a community dominated by members of the order Synechococcales (from 38 to 96% relative abundance), but with significant presence of taxa from Cyanobacteriales including Microcystaceae and Nostocaceae. A persistent Microcystis population was detected in samples both testing positive and negative for the mcyE gene, highlighting the importance of identifying cyanotoxin production potential by gene presence and not species identity. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of amplicon-based approaches to studying toxic cyanobacteria in an understudied region-Atlantic Canada.

J	Qian, FP; Wen, XL; Xi, YL				Qian, Fang-Ping; Wen, Xin-Li; Xi, Yi-Long			Seasonal variations of rotifer communities in three climatic zones: effects of environmental parameters on changes of functional groups	LIMNOLOGY												In this study, the annual changes of rotifer communities were observed in six lakes belonging to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate zones. Rotifers were classified into different functional groups based on the morphology of the corona and trophi. The abundance and biomass of each functional group were compared between climatic zones, and the driving environmental factors were analyzed. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), and similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) indicated distinct separation in rotifer community structure between the three climatic zones. The subtropical zone showed more functional groups, higher abundance and biomass of dominant functional groups than tropical and warm temperate zones. Asplanchna abundance and water transparency were considered as the major factors affecting rotifer functional groups in all the three climatic zones. Chlorophyll a content (Chl-a) was more important in subtropical and warm temperate zones than in tropical zone. Water temperature mainly affected rotifer functional groups in warm temperate and tropical zones, but showed less effects in subtropical zone. In addition, NO2--N content was an important factor in warm temperate zone, but not in subtropical and tropical zones. Overall, classification of functional groups could be a useful method to investigate the changes of rotifer community structure in different climatic zones.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2022	23	1					165	180		10.1007/s10201-021-00681-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-021-00681-z		OCT 2021											WOS:000705737800001
J	Amon, JP; Thompson, CA; Carpenter, QJ; Miner, J				Amon, JP; Thompson, CA; Carpenter, QJ; Miner, J			Temperate zone fens of the glaciated Midwestern USA	WETLANDS												A study of more than 70 fens in the Midwestern United States and a review of the literature indicates that these temperate zone wetlands may differ from fens of the boreal zone and are not adequately differentiated from them by present classification systems. Fens of the Midwestern temperate zone 1) are wetlands with high botanical diversity, 2) are supported in part by ground water with conductivity > 100mS/cm and circumneutral pH, 3) contain water in the root zone during most of the growing season yet are not usually inundated, and 4) accumulate organic and/or carbonate substrates. Individually, none of these descriptors is adequate to distinguish fens from other wetland communities of the Midwest such as marshes, sedge meadows, and wet prairies; yet, when they are taken together, such discrimination is possible. While fens of this zone share many species, our study does not support using indicator species because too few are both faithfully represented and geographically widespread. Midwestern temperate fens are sustained by forces of climate, landscape, and geology, which permit ground water to seep continuously into the root zone in a focused location. Since water availability in the temperate Midwest is less than in the boreal zone, continuous discharge is needed to maintain the saturation conducive to peat formation.

J	Brraich, OS; Kaur, R				Brraich, Onkar Singh; Kaur, Rajwinder			Temporal composition and distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in wetlands	CURRENT SCIENCE												Studies on the composition, distribution and seasonality of the benthic invertebrates of the Nangal wetland were undertaken for two years from February 2013 to January 2015. Twenty-four genera of benthic macro invertebrates were recorded, out of which five belonged to Ephemeropteras, two to Plecoptera, five to Hemiptera, three to Diptera, two to Tricoptera, two to Coleoptera, one to Araneae, one to Odonata, two to Annelida and one to Gastropoda. The range, mean and standard deviation of macrobenthos have been recorded. The abundance of macroinvertebrates ranged between 79 and 534 individuals/m(2) (mean 297 [RS1]individuals/m(2)) during 2013-14 and 109-612 individuals/m2 (mean 400 individuals/m(2)) during 2014-15. Statistical relationship between different physico-chemical parameters and macroinvertebrates was also computed. The Simpson's index ranged from 0.9428 during 2013-14 to 0.9493 during 2014-15. The Shannon index was 3.117 during 2013-14 and 3.154 during 2014-15, which indicates that the wetland is moderately polluted that further affects the occurrence of benthic macroinvertebrates.																			0011-3891					JAN 10	2017	112	1					116	125		10.18520/cs/v112/i01/116-125	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v112/i01/116-125													WOS:000392355900021

However, there is ongoing debate about whether external DOC that enters a lake can pass up the food web to support top consumers. We show, from experimental manipulation of a whole lake, that externally loaded DOC can contribute appreciably to fish biomass. Monthly additions of cane sugar with a distinct carbon stable isotope value during 2 years rapidly enriched the C-13 content of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, with a more gradual C-13 enrichment of fish. After sugar addition stopped, the C-13 content of consumers reverted towards original values. A simple isotope mixing model indicated that by the end of the sugar addition almost 20% of fish carbon in the lake was derived from the added sugar. Our results provide the first direct experimental demonstration at relevant ecological spatial and temporal scales that externally loaded DOC to lakes can indeed transfer to top consumers.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Peura, Sari/0000-0003-3892-8157; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2018	21	3					495	506		10.1007/s10021-017-0164-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0164-6													WOS:000428556200008

Driving factors of temporary and permanent shallow lakes in and around Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe	WATER SA												Small aquatic ecosystems in semi-arid environments are characterised by strong seasonal water level fluctuations. In addition, land use as well as artificial pumping of groundwater to maintain water resources throughout the dry season may affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we investigated pans situated in and around Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, where certain waterholes are artificially maintained during the dry season for conservation purposes. We monitored 30 temporary and permanent waterholes for 7 months across the wet and dry seasons in 2013, and analysed them for standard parameters to investigate seasonal variations, assess the effects of land use and pumping on lake functioning, and determine the driving factors of these aquatic systems. Results show an increase in conductivity, hardness, and turbidity when temporary pans dry up and permanent ones are filled with groundwater. Prominent parameters explaining the diversity of aquatic ecosystems are water hardness, conductivity, turbidity, and the presence of vegetation. Seasonality differences in certain parameters suggest the influence of water level fluctuations associated with rainfall, evaporation, and pumping activities. Further, the distinction between turbid pans and those with clear water and vegetation suggests the alternative functioning of pans. Land use had no significant effects, while the effects of pumping are discussed. In times of water scarcity, animals gather around artificially maintained waterholes and foul water with faeces and urine, thus inducing water eutrophication.						kativu, shakkie/0000-0001-7913-2804; Hulot, Florence D./0000-0002-8897-3987													0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2018	44	2					269	282		10.4314/wsa.v44i2.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v44i2.12													WOS:000434082400012

Similar species D. brachyurum, previously described in both lakes, is found in insignificant numbers. In 2004-2015, the seasonal abundance, spatial distribution, and diel vertical migration of D. mongolianum were studied in deep mesotrophic Lake Pleshcheevo. The species was found in the plankton from early June until October, with the maximum abundance in July-August. The late appearance of males and gamogenetic females (September) is characteristic of its population. D. mongolianum was the most abundant in the epilimnion of the pelagic zone, where it performed diel vertical migrations, concentrating in the surface layer (0-2 m) at night and at a depth of 2-6 m during the day.

We evaluated the decay rates of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and viral RNA in wastewater and ambient waters under temperature regimes representative of seasonal fluctuations. Infectious virus was seeded in autoclaved primary wastewater effluent, final dechlorinated wastewater effluent, lake water, and marine water at a final concentration of 6.26 +/- 0.07 log10 plaque forming units per milliliter. Each suspension was incubated at either 4 degrees, 25 degrees, and 37 degrees C. Samples were initially collected on an hourly basis, then approximately every other day for 15 days. All samples were analyzed for infectious virus via a plaque assay using the Vero E6 cell line, and viral gene copy levels were quantified with the US CDC's N1 and N2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. The infectious virus decayed significantly faster (p <= 0.0214) compared to viral RNA, which persisted for the duration of the study irrespective of the incubation conditions. The initial loss (within 15 min of seeding) as well as decay of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was significantly faster (p <= 0.0387) in primary treated wastewater compared to other water types, but viral RNA did not degrade appreciably in this matrix until day 15. Overall, temperature was the most important driver of decay, and after 24 h, no infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected at 37 degrees C in any water type.

Large shallow lake response to anthropogenic stressors and climate change: Missing macroinvertebrate recovery after oligotrophication (Lake Balaton, East-Central Europe)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												East-Central Europe 's largest shallow lake, Balaton, experienced strong eutrophication in the 1970 -80s, followed by water quality improvement and oligotrophication by 2010 CE. Recently however, repeated cyanobacterial blooms occurred and warned that internal P-recycling can act similarly to external P load, therefore we need a better understanding of past water level (WL) and trophic changes in the lake. In this study we discuss the last 500-yr trophic, WL and habitat changes of the lake using paleoecological (chironomids, pollen) and geochemical (sediment chlorophyll, TOC, TS, TN, C/H ratio, major and trace element) methods. We demonstrate that the most intensive and irreversible change in the macroinvertebrate fauna occurred during the period of economic boom between the First and Second World War (similar to 1925 -1940 CE), when large-scale built-in and leisure use of the lake has intensified. At that time, the Procladius-Microchironomus-Stempellina dominated community transformed to Procladius- Chironomus plumosus- type- Microchironomus community that coincided with land use changes, intensified erosion and water-level regulation in the lake with the maintenance of year-round high WL. This was followed by the impoverishment and population size decrease of the chironomid fauna and Procladius dominance since 1940 CE, without any recovery after 1994 CE despite the ongoing oligotrophication. Accelerated rate of change and turnover of the fauna was connected to an increase in the benthivorous fish biomass and eutrophication. The basin lost almost completely its once characteristic Stempellina species between 1927 and 1940 CE due to trophic level increase and seasonal anoxia in the Szemes Basin. Reference conditions for ecosystem improvement were assigned to 1740 -1900 CE. We conclude that in spite of the ongoing oligotrophication, the re establishment of the Procladius-Microchironomus-Stempellina assemblage is hampered, and requires fish population regulation.

This article presents the results of research on the composition of water macroelements in 24 artificial reservoirs located in Opole province (southern Poland), searching for the reasons behind their pollution. Concentrations of the anions F-, Cl-, Br-, NO2-, NO3-, PO43- and SO42- and cations Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were taken into account. An analysis of seasonal changes was carried out and, on the example of a dam reservoir (Turawa Big Reservoir), a multi-point analysis of the distribution of ion concentrations in water at the reservoir surface was also carried out. It was shown that retention and flow-through reservoirs, where the main source of pollution is the water feeding the reservoirs, are the most vulnerable to pollution. The second group consists of closed reservoirs located in industrial and agricultural areas, which are exposed to pollution from rainwater run-off and field leachate. In the case of reservoirs created in marl mining areas, a significant effect was also indicated from the chemical composition of the substrate on the formation of ionic equilibria in waters filling the excavations. The research shows that there are no hard and fast rules regarding the seasonal variability of ion concentrations during the growing season, indicating that eutrophic reservoirs show greater variability of ion concentration.

This article presents the results of studying the chemical composition of atmospheric deposition (aerosols and precipitation) at this station in 2020, and of their comparison with the data from previous years (from 2000 to 2019). In 2020, the ionic composition of atmospheric aerosols and precipitation had changed compared to previous years. In the modern period, the total amount of ions in aerosols, accounting for 0.46 & PLUSMN; 0.40 mu g & BULL;m(-3), was lower by an order of magnitude than between 2000 and 2004. The average annual total amount of ions in precipitation in Listvyanka was almost unchanged from the average values in 2000-2010 and was 10% lower than that from 2011 to 2019 (7.3 mg/L). The ratio of major ions of sulphates and ammonium changed in the aerosol composition: compared to the period from 2000 to 2004, in 2020, the contribution of ammonium ions had decreased significantly, from 32% to 24%; the contribution of sulphates had increased to 43%, and the contribution of calcium had increased from 8 to 13%. Since 2010, the contribution of K+ ions has increased to 8-10%, indicating the effect of smoke aerosols from wildfires. In precipitation, despite the dominance of sulphates (26%) and calcium (18%) throughout the year, the contribution of nitrates increases to 19% during the cold season (from October to March), while the contribution of ammonium ions and hydrogen ions increases to 13% and 17%, respectively, in the warm season (from April to September). In 2020, as in previous research years, the acidity of precipitation at the Listvyanka station was elevated (pH 5.1 & PLUSMN; 0.5); 50% of precipitation in 2020 had pH < 5. We quantified ions in atmospheric aerosols and precipitation on the underlying surface of the coastal southwestern part of Lake Baikal. Ion fluxes with precipitation were the highest in the warm season, which corresponds to the annual maximum precipitation. Unlike previous years (from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2019), wet deposition of most ions-especially calcium, ammonium and nitrates-had decreased in 2020. There was a 35-fold decrease in nitrogen fluxes and a 5-fold decrease in sulphur fluxes in aerosols, as well as 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold decreases, respectively, in precipitation.

Physicochemical parameters and concentrations of potentially toxic metals were evaluated in an urban reserve in the Central East of Argentina, created for urban flood risk management. During 1 year, in seasonal samplings, environmental parameters, nutrients, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and concentrations of potentially toxic metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd) in water and benthic sediments were analyzed in four sampling sites. The heavy metal geo-accumulation index (Igeo) was also calculated. Quali-quantitative analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton samples was performed and summarized in ecological attributes and indices: Total density, specific richness, Shannon's diversity index, Simpsons' dominance index, and evenness index, as well as phytoplanktonic biovolume and functional groups. Except Cu, metal concentrations in water exceeded recommended limits for freshwaters in 37.5% (Cr), 31.3% (Pb), and 18.8% (Cd) of samples. Igeo revealed that sediments were moderately, highly, and very seriously polluted with Cu, Cr, and Pb, respectively. Phytoplankton showed the predominance of functional groups typical of eutrophic and low-flow environments, with high concentrations of nutrients. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred in 75% of the samples, considered high-risk events for the aquatic life and users of the urban reserve. The zooplankton community was dominated by microzooplankton, characterized by smaller species, more tolerant to polluted and eutrophic waters. This survey evidences the urgent need to develop a comprehensive management plan for the area.					; Andrade, Victoria/D-4170-2015	Regaldo, Luciana/0000-0002-7953-4122; Andrade, Victoria Soledad/0000-0002-1860-9792; Vaschetto, Pablo Andres/0000-0001-7802-3913; Gervasio, Susana/0000-0001-7141-8699; Gagneten, Ana Maria/0000-0001-6402-2389; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2021	232	10							427	10.1007/s11270-021-05380-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05380-0													WOS:000705238200003

Microbial metabolisms can drive such alteration by changing carbonate saturation in situ, thereby driving dissolution or precipitation. The net impact these microbial processes have on the primary delta O-18, delta C-13, and Delta(47) values of lacustrine carbonate is not fully known. We studied the evolution of microbial community structure and the porewater and sediment geochemistry in the upper similar to 30 cm of sediment from two shoreline sites at Green Lake, Fayetteville, NY over 2 years of seasonal sampling. We linked seasonal and depth-based changes of porewater carbonate chemistry to microbial community composition, in situ carbon cycling (using delta C-13 values of carbonate, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and organic matter), and dominant allochems and facies. We interpret that microbial processes are a dominant control on carbon cycling within the sediment, affecting porewater DIC, aqueous carbon chemistry, and carbonate carbon and clumped isotope geochemistry. Across all seasons and sites, microbial organic matter remineralization lowers the delta C-13 of the porewater DIC. Elevated carbonate saturation states in the sediment porewaters (Omega > 3) were attributed to microbes from groups capable of sulfate reduction, which were abundant in the sediment below 5 cm depth. The nearshore carbonate sediments at Green Lake are mainly composed of microbialite intraclasts/oncoids, charophytes, larger calcite crystals, and authigenic micrite-each with a different origin. Authigenic micrite is interpreted to have precipitated in situ from the supersaturated porewaters from microbial metabolism. The stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13(carb)) and clumped isotope values (Delta(47)) of bulk carbonate sediments from the same depth horizons and site varied depending on both the sampling season and the specific location within a site, indicating localized (mu m to mm) controls on carbon and clumped isotope values. Our results suggest that biological processes are a dominant control on carbon chemistry within the sedimentary subsurface of the shorelines of Green Lake, from actively forming microbialites to pore space organic matter remineralization and micrite authigenesis. A combination of biological activity, hydrologic balance, and allochem composition of the sediments set the stable carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotope signals preserved by the Green Lake carbonate sediments.					; Ingalls, Miquela/AAJ-2645-2020	SNELL, KATHRYN/0000-0001-5373-7143; Olsen-Valdez, Juliana/0009-0000-0092-9707; Frantz, Carie/0000-0003-2544-9245; Trower, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9898-5589; 													1472-4677	1472-4669				JUL	2024	22	4							e12609	10.1111/gbi.12609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12609								38958391					WOS:001266667700001

Ecological connectivity indicates the potential for rapid recolonization upon local depletion, while genetic connectivity informs about the conservation needs related to the evolution of subpopulations and ecotypes in metapopulations. We combined acoustic biotelemetry and pooled-genome sequencing to study a northern pike (Esox lucius) population as a model of a freshwater piscivore that inhabits a network of shallow brackish lagoons in the southern Baltic Sea. We found limited ecological connectivity among genetically similar subpopulations of pike, suggesting a metapopulation structure characterized by discrete local subpopulations with infrequent migrations between them. Connectivity of different lagoons increased during spawning, suggesting directed spawning migrations to either freshwater rivers or low salinity patches in connected lake-like bays. Spawning site fidelity to either brackish or freshwater spawning sites was observed, further contributing to the reproductive isolation of certain subpopulations. The genetic population structure aligned with salinity gradients and geographical distance and was significant between pairs of rivers draining into the lagoon network, but it was unrelated to ecological connectivity. The results collectively suggest that local subpopulations may not rapidly replenish upon local depletion and that even weak connectivity among subpopulations was sufficient to maintain genetic homogeneity across lagoons with similar salinity levels. Effective management and conservation of species forming metapopulations, such as the coastal northern pike studied here, necessitate localized approaches that adapt fishing mortality to local abundance and promote access to specific habitats, especially rivers, during spawning to conserve the entire genetic biodiversity and foster resilience of the metapopulation.					; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010; Lukyanova, Olga/JSK-1924-2023; Dhellemmes, Félicie/AAY-8522-2021	Dennenmoser, Stefan/0000-0003-4624-0598; Lukyanova, Olga/0000-0001-7091-7648; Dhellemmes, Felicie/0000-0002-2043-4653; Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2024	86	3							77	10.1007/s00027-024-01090-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01090-x													WOS:001254799500001

Seasonal traces of hydrometeorological variables at a daily or sub-daily resolution are needed to drive hydrological models at this timescale. Operationally available models such as the Climate Forecast System (CFS) provide seasonal precipitation forecasts, but their coarse spatial scale requires further processing for use in local or regional hydrologic models. We focus on three methods to generate such forecasts: (1) a bias-adjustment method, in which the CFS forecasts are bias-corrected by ground-based observations; (2) a weather generator (WG) method, in which historical precipitation data, conditioned on an index of the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, are used to generate synthetic daily precipitation time series; and (3) a historical analog method, in which the CFS forecasts are used to condition the selection of historical satellite-based mean areal precipitation (MAP) traces. The Yaque del Norte River basin in the Dominican Republic is presented herein as a case study, using an independent dataset of rainfall and reservoir inflows to assess the relative performance of the methods. The methods showed seasonal variations in skill, with the MAP historical analog method having the strongest overall performance, but the CFS and WG methods also exhibited strong performance during certain seasons. These results indicate that the strengths of each method may be combined to produce an ensemble forecast product.

The authors developed an approach that combines a multimedia environmental exposure model (Grid-Catchment Integrated Modeling System) and density dynamics models for algae. This approach enabled assessment of ecological risk when the exposure concentration shows spatiotemporal variation. First, risk maps of 5 herbicides (pretilachlor, butachlor, simetryn, mefenacet, and esprocarb) were created from the spatial predictions of environmental concentrations and 50% inhibitory concentrations of the herbicides. Simulations of algal density dynamics at high-risk sites were then conducted by incorporating the predicted temporal dynamics of the environmental concentration of each herbicide at the sites. The results suggested that the risk of pretilachlor was clearly the highest of the 5 herbicides, in terms of both the spatial distributions and the temporal durations. The present study highlights the importance of integrating exposure models and effect models to clarify spatial and temporal risk and to develop management plans for chemical exposure that shows high spatiotemporal variation.

J	Möller, P; Siebert, C				Moeller, Peter; Siebert, Christian			Cycling of calcite and hydrous metal oxides and chemical changes of major element and REE chemistry in monomictic hardwater lake: Impact on sedimentation	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												The variation of major and rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in the monomictic hardwater Lake Tiberias during the wet and dry seasons of the hydrological year was studied in two profiles. The average volume and CI concentration of the known and unknown saline inflows of 1.6 x 10(7) m(3) and 1.2 x 10(9) mol are derived by closing both balances. This brine corresponds to a mixture of 83% of groundwater from Cretaceous aquifers and 17% of very saline deep brine. Taking cycling of calcite in the hypolimnion into account, the settling rate of authigenic calcite is estimated to be 3.3 mol m(-2) a(-1). In the stratified lake of the dry season dissolved inorganic carbon increases by 490 mu M at the thermoichemocline due to microbial reduction of SO42-, NO3-, chemical reduction of Fe(III) and MnO2 colloids, and cycling of calcite in the hypolimnion. REY distribution in the stratified water column is dominantly controlled by coprecipitation with calcite, hydrous ferric oxides and MnO2 in the epilimnion and cycling of these compounds in the hypolimnion. The positive Ce anomaly in the hypolimnetic water is produced by cycling of MnO2. The simulation of the increase of REY in the hypolimnion reveals that hydrous ferric and manganese oxides only play a negligible role except Ce. Only about 10% of REY from cycled matter enhance REY in solution. Most of the released REY are adsorbed by particular matter and thus settling on the floor of the lake. Different from Na, U, SO42- and SiO2, the other elements, in particular REY, increase in the mixed water column from the top to the lower third and mostly decrease thereafter toward the bottom in the mixed lake during the wet season. The behavior of REY is caused by some cycling of calcite and pH-dependent re-equilibration of REY bound to hydrous ferric and manganese oxides adsorbed by.particular matter. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF MICROCYSTINS FROM THE HOUSEHOLD'S DRINKING WATER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria produce toxins which are hazardous to the health of people who are using water that is contaminated. The hazard quotient suggested by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was used to assess the human health hazard of using contaminated water containers. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.5511) in the level of microcystin between blooming and decaying seasons. Findings show that all treated water samples in the containers were below the 1.0 mu g/L level, which underscore this important issue: drinking water from treated water in containers has no adverse health effect when compared to drinking water from non-treated water containers, whether used by adults or children. In conclusion, collecting and storing of either pre-treated or non-treated water using containers needs post-treatment before drinking.

Crayfish meat yield ranged from a minimum of 11.3% to a maximum of 16.3% of wet weight in specimens from Keban and Iznik, respectively. Meat yield was significantly different, depending on the living environment. The protein content of the meat of A. leptodactylus ranged from 15.4 to 17.5%. The moisture content of crayfish was significantly lower in the high lipid containing Iznik Lake's crayfish. Crayfish lipids were poor in saturated fatty acids, but rich in PUFA's and in particular EPA, DHA and ARA. In all groups, the major saturated fatty acids were palmitic acid, stearic acid and myristic acid. Among the omega-6 fatty acid series, a high level of ARA was observed in crayfish meat. EPA may be considered as the major omega-3 fatty acid in crayfish lipids. There was no single fatty acid indicating regional differences in crayfish specimens.

From March 2011 to May 2013, the spatiotemporal distribution variation of cyanobacteria community associated with environmental factors was comprehensively investigated based on a monthly sampling. A total of 27 cyanobacteria species belonging to 14 genera were identified, and the most predominant cyanobacteria genus was Pseudanabaena, not the usual bloom-forming genera such as Microcystis and Anabaena. The cyanobacteria abundance at all the sampling sites exhibited similar spatio-temporal distribution variation, and the cyanobacteria abundance ranged over seven orders of magnitude from the undetectable level to 3.9 x 10(7) cells/L. Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were applied to analyze the relationship between species and environment variables. The results suggested there was a positive correlation between cyanobacteria abundance and water temperature and ammonium concentration, while that between cyanobacteria abundance and dissolved oxygen concentration was negative. In addition, other environmental factors like precipitation and water turbulence could affect the cyanobacteria community distribution. Cyanobacterial blooms might not occur in Luoma Lake, with the predominant cyanobacteria genus being Pseudanabaena and water quality improved owing to the implementation of the water diversion project.																			1944-3994	1944-3986					2016	57	15					6658	6669		10.1080/19443994.2015.1015450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2015.1015450													WOS:000372747700004

Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in a naturally acidic lake (Lake Caviahue, Argentina)	LIMNOLOGY												As a result of a low pH, the inorganic carbon of acidic lakes is present as CO2 at air-equilibrium concentration and is substantially lower than the inorganic carbon concentration in higher-pH waters with bicarbonate. This situation is quite common in artificially acidified lakes and where inorganic carbon is considered the limiting factor in phytoplankton growth. Apart from low inorganic carbon content, Lake Caviahue in Argentina has low nitrogen and high phosphorus content. The aim of this work was to assess the importance of inorganic carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen, relating data on lake nutrients to phytoplankton species requirements. Lake samples taken in the 2004-2006 period did not show any particular trend in the vertical distribution of the water column of ammonium, inorganic carbon, and phosphorus with reference to either seasonality or depth. A decrease of some 15% in the lake's phosphorus concentration was observed over the same period. Although the total phytoplankton biomass in Lake Caviahue was similar throughout the period, a seasonal variation was observed. Lab bioassays were carried out with solutions of bicarbonates, ammonium, nitrates, and phosphate. We worked with three species separately, namely, two chlorophytes, Keratococcus rhaphidioides and Watanabea sp.; and one euglenophyte, Euglena mutabilis. Answers to specific nutrient requirements differed for each algal species: both chlorophytes prefer ammonium or nitrates added on their own, whereas the euglenophyte registered a higher growth rate with the joint addition of ammonium and phosphorus. Even when the limiting nutrient(s) for phytoplankton yield and rate varied between species, we observed a tendency for nitrogen limitation in Lake Caviahue.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2010	11	2					103	113		10.1007/s10201-009-0295-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0295-3													WOS:000278932000002

The study showed that the number of bacteria and level phosphatase activity were higher in the sand of the beach subjected to stronger anthropopressure. In both studied beaches bacteria hydrolysing DNA were the most numerous (92.7-302.8 CFU.g(-1) d.w.). The least numerous were phytin (26.0. 10(3) CFU.g(-1) d.w.) and phenolphthalein diphosphate (11.1.10(3) CFU.g(-1) d.w.) decomposing bacteria. Number of bacteria able to attack tested organic phosphorus compounds were the most numerous in dry zones (10.77-739.92 CFU.g(-1) d.w.) then wet zones (3.34-218.15 CFU.g(-1) d.w.). In both studied beaches bacteria hydrolysing organic phosphorus compounds and phosphatase activity generally were more numerous in surface sand layer. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of bacteria in both studied beaches was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chlorophyll and its degradation products provide an estimate of overall biomass, and carotenoid pigments provide taxonomic biomarkers of phytoplankton. We examined the pigments preserved in sediment cores from the Louisiana continental shelf adjacent to the outflow of the Mississippi River system to document changes in phytoplankton community composition, phytoplankton abundance, and conditions of hypoxia over time. Carbon accumulated in sediments from water depths of 20-60 in is primarily derived from marine phytoplankton and represents the history of phytoplankton communities in the overlying water. There is a general increase in chlorophyll a, pheopigments, zeaxanthin, fucoxanthin and most carotenoids over time, with the change gradual from 1955 to 1970, followed by a fairly steady increase to 1997. The highest chloropigment concentrations are in cores from areas more likely to be exposed to seasonal hypoxia. These indicate an increase in eutrophication in the form of greater diatom and cyanobacterial production, or a worsening of hypoxia, or both. This trend expanded westward along the Louisiana shelf in the 1990s. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The water temperature and hydrology variations affect the distribution of zooplankton. A positive correlation was established between the total zooplankton and the water temperature (r=0.9, n=9, p < 0.05). Fourteen zooplankton species were identified. Seasonal changes in the density (ANOVA, F=3.7, d.f=36, p < 0.01) and the biomass of total zooplankton (ANOVA, F=4.4, d.f=36, p < 0.001) were observed. Our results suggest that planktivorous fish may not modify the zooplankton dynamics in Beni Mtir reservoir (oligotrophic). On the contrary, in Sidi Saad reservoir (mesotrophic), fish predation has major effects on seasonal zooplankton dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rebollal, MB; Pérez-González, A				Bernat Rebollal, M.; Perez-Gonzalez, A.			Inland aeolian deposits of the Iberian Peninsula: Sand dunes and clay dunes of the Duero Basin and the Manchega Plain. Palaeoclimatic considerations	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper describes the latest research on the geomorphological characteristics, formation environment and chronology of the main inland aeolian deposits from the south-eastern Duero Basin (DB) and the Manchega Plain (MP) of the Iberian Peninsula. Similarities and differences between the aeolian deposits of these two locations are summarised. Wind deflation from the Guadiana and Jucar alluvial systems created the aeolian deposits of the MP. These deposits are mainly composed of quartz sands. However, in the San Juan alluvial plain (MP) there is a large extent of clay dunes formed by exposure to prevalent winds of seasonal playa-lakes with salt and clay sediments. In the DB, wind remobilisation of the small particles from Quaternary terraces and Tertiary arkosic sediments left aeolian deposits of quartz-feldspar sands. Textural parameters of the aeolian deposits show large variations depending on the location and the original deposit. Thus, in the DB the aeolian sands derived from the deflation of fluvial sediments are better sorted and smaller in grain size than those created by the deflation of arkosic sediments. Morphologically, simple and compound parabolic dunes (U-V forms, hemicyclic, lobate and elongate), crescentic and linear dunes, climbing dunes and blowout dunes have been recognized at both sites. Barchan and dome dunes are present only in the DB while "lunette lunette-clay dunes" are found only in the MP. In both locations, the large extent of aeolian sand sheets and the predominance of simple and compound parabolic dunes indicates the active role of sparse vegetation cover in the formation of this aeolian system. In the DB, dunes were formed by southwest and west winds, while in the MP the aeolian morphologies indicate that the prevalent winds were west and northwest. The chronology of the dune deposits is being determined with luminescence (TL-OSL) dating and Mass Spectrometry Analysis (C-14-AMS). In this way, the aeolian activity and stabilisation stages can be established, the latter well marked in the DB through soil A horizon development. Thus, the main sand dune formation in the DB and the eastern regions of the MP occurred between 13.5 and 7 ka BP, during the cold and and Younger Dryas episode and the Early Holocene. The clay dunes of the MP accumulated mainly from 29 to 19 ka BP that corresponds with Heinrich events HE-3 and HE-2 and the Last Glacial Maximum. However, clay dunes were also formed between 13.5 and 7 ka BP. In both locations, there have been reactivations of some sand deposits in the recent Holocene, with maximum activity around 5-2 ka BP and 0.5-0.2 ka BP. On the other hand, three marked stages of stabilisation of the DB aeolian system have been established with C-14-AMS, around 10.2, 6.2 and 1.2 ka BR Finally, the main winds contributing to dune construction were also responsible for the deflation processes with the formation of erosional depressions.

Fish Diversity and Abundance in Relation to Interannual and Lake-Specific Variation in Abiotic Characteristics of Floodplain Lakes of the Lower Kaskaskia River, Illinois	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The importance of floodplain lakes to tropical river systems is well established, but little is known about the function of these habitats in temperate river systems. We examined fish diversity, abundance, and reproduction within six oxbow lakes of the Kaskaskia River, Illinois, over 5 years and their relationship to 11 abiotic environmental variables. The lakes were hydrologically dynamic within and among years, varying in the nine connected with the main stem (0-22 weeks/year) and the frequency of low (<0.3-m) water (0-23 weeks/year), Differences were found both among years and lakes. All measured limnological variables (dissolved oxygen, Secchi disk depth, conductivity, and temperature) varied temporally, but only conductivity and Secchi disk depth varied among lakes. Fish species differed among lakes and between adjacent lotic habitats, and species-specific abundance varied among years, seasons, and lakes. This variation was related to several environmental variables. Diversity was positively related to the distance between the oxbow lake and the river but not to any variables that had interannual variation. Seine catch per unit effort (CPUE) was negatively related to mean water level and Secchi disk depth. Total electrofishing CPUE was not related to any variables however, that of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus was positively related to maximum depth and that of warmouths L. gulosus was positively related to vegetated area. Across all lakes, evidence of reproduction was found for five species and was negatively related to the mean water level and frequency of low water and positively related to flood periodicity. The oxbow lakes have the potential to contribute to the fish community of the main river by providing spawning and nursery habitat for several fish species as well as helping maintain several less abundant main-stern species. However, when considering management options to maintain or restore these ecosystem functions. interannual variation in environmental variables, particularly those related to flood periodicity, should be considered.

Isotopic analysis of calcite from Lake Junin, Peru, provides a record of hydrologic variability that spans the last glacial-interglacial transition in the southern tropics. The record reveals a 6 parts per thousand enrichment in delta(18)O(calcite) during the late glacial followed by a gradual depletion during the Holocene, which can be interpreted as a decrease followed by a long-term increase in effective moisture. Close agreement between delta(18)O(calcite) and rainy season insolation indicates that long-term changes in tropical hydrology were linked to orbital variations. Furthermore, hydrologic change was out of phase in the northern and southern tropics over this time period.

HIGH STAGE EVENTS AND STREAM BANK EROSION ON SMALL GRAZED PASTURE STREAM REACHES IN THE RATHBUN LAKE WATERSHED, SOUTHERN IOWA, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES												Stream bank erosion in agricultural landscapes is a major pathway for non-point source sediment and phosphorus loading of receiving waters. Previous studies have shown direct and indirect effects of land use on stream bank erosion, and identified high erosion rates within riparian pastures. One potential impact of agricultural land-use on stream bank erosion is the alteration of stream stage characteristics, including an increase in frequency of high-stage events over short periods of time (forming flash hydrographs). The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the number of high stream stages and corresponding stream bank soil erosion. The study was conducted in six grazed pasture stream reaches within the Rathbun Lake Watershed, a reservoir on the Chariton River located within the Southern Iowa Drift Plain. The erosion pin method was utilized to measure the change in stream bank erosion in response to differences in the number of high stream-stage events, which were monitored by pressure transducers. The measured seasonal bank erosion rates were correlated with the different stream stages data to assess their impact on stream bank erosion. Based on the different model assumptions, there were generally strong linear relationships between high stage and bank erosion. Approximately 75% of the variability in stream bank erosion rates was directly linked to the number of high stages/erosive stream flow depths. Conservation practices that reduce these erosion rates will be those that increase soil-water infiltration, reduce the frequency of high stream flow events and increase bank stability through perennial vegetation cover or reducing disturbance within the riparian zone.

Temperatures were warmer in the preferred spawning habitat of largemouth bass, and the majority of nests had offspring that had reached the swim-up stage at the opening of the bass angling season in 2 of the 3 years examined. In contrast, the proportion of smallmouth bass nests that had reached the swim-up stage when the bass angling season opened ranged from 4 to 13% during these years. Using models created from nest observations and temperature data, we provide estimates of the additional time required to allow higher percentages (20%, 50% and 80%) of smallmouth bass nests to reach the swim-up stage. Invasive round goby, which are an important nest predator, were more abundant in the spawning habitat preferred by smallmouth bass. A simulated angling experiment showed that round gobies invaded about half of the nests when the guarding male was briefly angled and released. In view of these results, it may be important to reevaluate the dates for the closed season in order to maintain the quality of the bass fisheries in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River.

Thus, quick and effective methods for detecting the abundance of cyanobacteria in waterbodies are needed to complement conventional laboratory methods. In addition, inadequate control techniques that are applied at times of high cyanobacterial concentrations can cause the cells to lyse and release toxins into the water. In the present study we investigated the behaviour of cyanobacteria by determining phycocyanin and chlorophyll concentrations, using spectroradiometric and fluorometric techniques, in three field campaigns performed at the Nova Avanhandava Reservoir, Brazil. The sampling rate and favourable season for data collected had been determined previously by remote sensing analysis. Seasonal estimates of cyanobacteria were made because fluorometric sensors were able to record low concentrations, whereas the spectral analyses only detected phycocyanin at higher concentrations. Results of spectral analyses highlighted the subtle spectral characteristics indicating the presence of phycocyanin, even without a clear definition of the diagnostic features in the reflectance curve. Therefore, multiscale remote sensing complemented by fluorometric analysis and relevant environmental variables is an effective approach for monitoring cyanobacteria in Brazilian inland waters.

The annual dataset belonging physical and chemical features in the reservoir was obtained by the monthly intervals between the years 2010 and 2011. A total of 15 parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), light permeability, conductivity, salinity, chloride, pH, total hardness, Ca, Mg, NO2-N, NO3-N, o-PO4, SO4) have been monitored at three different sampling stations in the reservoir and a total of 495 observations were grouped statistically. The sampled periods have been classified into three different groups by using the BCCA. The results were supported by the PCA and CA statistical methods. Consequently, in order to determine and to evaluate for large complex datasets that belong to environmental properties, multivariate analyses are very useful techniques. Thus, the sampling periods to monitor the physicochemical including in a water resource can be determined.

J	Estigoni, MV; Miranda, RB; Mauad, FF				Estigoni, Marcus Vinicius; Miranda, Renato Billia; Mauad, Frederico Fabio			Hydropower reservoir sediment and water quality assessment	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Purpose - Finer sediment particles (silt and clay) transported by rivers carry the major part of nutrient loads by absorption; thus, sediment settling can remove nutrients from the water column. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relation between reservoir sedimentation and water quality by assessing the reservoir sedimentation process and the sediments' characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Bathymetric surveys from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed to assess the sedimentation process. Core samples provided information on a layer-by-layer basis of the sediment deposits, and water samples near the surface and near the bottom provided information on sediment concentration, and adsorbed and dissolved nutrients. Findings - The upstream region of a reservoir is already silted. From 2004 to 2014, the delta evoluted approximately 500 m downstream and the deposits were mainly composed of clay. An area of approximately 1,000 m between the delta and the dam should still be able to continue allowing sediment deposition in the coming years. Most of the nutrients were absorbed into the sediment particles, except for the nitrogen measured in the dry season. Research limitations/implications - Although analyses of the full cycle of the nutrients were not carried out, the constant sediment trapping of finer sediments and the high rate of absorbed nutrients in the suspended sediment support the hypothesis that the reservoir has removed nutrients from aqueous media by adsorption into sediments. Practical implications - In the studied case, reservoir sedimentation has led to better water quality downstream. Originality/value - It is shown in this study that reservoir sedimentation may have positive effects on river water quality.					; Estigoni, Marcus/O-2566-2015; Mauad, Frederico/AAR-7002-2021	Estigoni, Marcus Vinicius/0000-0002-0654-9219; Mauad, Frederico/0000-0002-2477-2019													1477-7835	1758-6119					2017	28	1					43	56		10.1108/MEQ-07-2015-0153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MEQ-07-2015-0153													WOS:000413397700004
J	Griffith, S; Pradalier, C				Griffith, Shane; Pradalier, Cedric			Survey Registration for Long-Term Natural Environment Monitoring	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS												This paper presents a survey registration framework to assist in the recurrent inspection of a natural environment. Our framework coarsely aligns surveys at the image-level using visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and it registers images at the pixel-level using SIFT Flow, which enables rapid manual inspection. The variation in appearance of natural environments makes data association a primary challenge of this work. We discuss this and other challenges, including 1) alternative approaches for coarsely aligning surveys of a natural environment, 2) how to select which images to compare between two surveys, and 3) strategies to boost image registration accuracy. We evaluate each stage of our approach, emphasizing alignment accuracy and stability with respect to large seasonal variations. Our domain is lakeshore monitoring, in which an autonomous surface vessel surveyed a 1-km lakeshore 33 times in 14 months. Our results show that our framework precisely aligns a significant number of images between surveys captured up to roughly three months apart, often across marked variation in appearance. Using these results, a human was able to spot several changes between surveys that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Condition dependence in the marine exit timing of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) returning to Copper Creek, Haida Gwaii	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined a small population of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that enters their natal stream, to hold in their natal lake, months (>130 days) prior to spawning. This effectively decouples the influence of spawn timing requirements and behaviours from river entry (alternately referred to as "marine exit") timing and is therefore a good model to study the migration strategies specifically associated with marine exit. We found individuals with early marine exit had higher growth rates in the months prior to river entry, had greater lipid density, were more likely male, more likely of the 2.2 versus 1.2 age class, had smaller gonads, and (if female) had more and smaller eggs. Body size at river entry did not vary seasonally. These patterns are explained using a life history model proposing that individual fish exit the sea when the marginal fitness benefits of further growth are outweighed by the marginal fitness cost of further marine residence. This point is reached at different times depending on body size, sex, lipid reserves, and the growth rate.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2017	74	1					15	22		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0533													WOS:000392100800003
J	Qian, KM; Liu, X; Chen, YW				Qian Kuimei; Liu Xia; Chen Yuwei			Effect of hydrological variability on diatom distribution in Poyang Lake, China	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, and it has a seasonal flooding cycle that significantly changes the water level every year. The aim of this paper was to explain how these hydrological changes influence diatom populations in Poyang Lake. The yearly hydrological cycle can be divided into 4 phases: low water-level phase, increasing water-level phase, high water-level phase and decreasing water-level phase. Variations in the abundance of planktonic diatoms were studied using quarterly monitoring data collected from January 2009 to October 2013. Generally, diatoms were dominant in Poyang Lake and accounted for more than 50% of the total phytoplankton biomass except in July 2009 (26%) and January 2012 (35%). Aulacoseira granulata and Surirella robusta were the predominant species in all four phases, and they accounted for 25.02% to 56.89% and 5.07% to 14.78% of the total phytoplankton biomass, respectively. A redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that changes in physico-chemical parameter were related to the water level, and changes in diatom biomass were related to nitrite levels and pH. These results indicate that changes in environmental parameters related to both seasonal variations and water-level fluctuations caused variations in diatom biomass and community composition in Poyang Lake. Furthermore, extreme hydrological events can have different influences on the diatom community composition in the main channel and lentic regions. This research provides data on the diatom variations in Poyang Lake and will be useful for establishing biological indicators of environmental change and protecting Poyang Lake in the future.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023														0254-4059	1993-5005				JAN	2017	35	1					174	184		10.1007/s00343-016-5264-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-016-5264-1													WOS:000390003700015

Identification of two gill parasites Lamproglena compacta (Copepoda: Lernaeidae) and Paradiplozoon bliccae (Monogenea: Diplozoidae) from endemic Aegean chub (Squalius fellowesii)	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												In this study, the occurrence of gill parasites in the Aegean chub Squalius fellowesii (Gunther, 1868) of Doganbaba Creek (Yesilova-Burdur, Turkey) was investigated. To date, very little is known about fish parasitofauna in this region and new research into parasites and their hosts are still required. The aim of the research was to improve the understanding of parasite communities in a native fish species, therefore 152 S. fellowesii were collected by electrofishing between January 2014 and February 2015. Fish gills were examined microscopically for parasites and the pathological changes, induced by parasites, were investigated. Two helminth species - Lamproglena compacta (Copepoda: Lernaeidae) and Paradiplozoon bliccae (Monogenea: Diplozoidae) were recorded localised on the extremity of the filaments. They caused an irregular appearance of the tissues at the attachment sites. In some cases more than one individual of the same or different species was observed at the same site. Histopathological examination in areas of parasite attachment revealed inflammation, hyperaemia and haemorrhages in the gills and slight hyperplasia. Prevalence, intensity and seasonality of infection, length classes, ages and sex compositions of infected populations were monitored and compared with other studies. To our knowledge, this is the first record of L. compacta and P. bliccae in Turkey.

Most studies, however were based on observation on independent water bodies, which may complicate the results with uninterested factors. A large river-connected lake has partitioned regions with the characteristics of either a river or a lake albeit allowing exchanging of zooplankton of different regions. Thus, a river-connected lake is an ideal system for studying distribution of crustacean zooplankton and investigating its affecting factors. In this study, 11 stations of a large river-connected lake, Lake Gaoyou, were sampled in all four seasons. Taxonomic diversity and species abundance were recorded and their correlation with environmental factors was investigated. A total of 26 and 22 species of crustacean zooplankton were recorded in the river and lake region, respectively. The abundance of crustacean in the river region was significantly higher than that in the lake region. The relative abundance of calanoids and Bosmina fatalis in the river region was lower than that in the lake region, whereas the abundance of cyclopoids and other cladocera species was lower in the lake region than in the river region. Cluster analysis showed that crustacean assemblages could be divided into two, one cluster grouping all sites from the river region, and the other cluster included all sites in the lake region. According to Pearson correlation and canonical correspondence analysis, the distribution of crustacean was positively correlated with water temperature and chlorophyll a gradient. Chlorophyll a and fish abundance are excellent predictors on spatial distribution of crustacean zooplankton in Lake Gaoyou. Our findings may also help in planning of bighead carp stocking in Lake Gaoyou.					chen, riming/B-5113-2012														1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	3					546	554		10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1622	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1622													WOS:000416222200009

Here, we asked how fish taxonomic and functional structures vary in response to different WLFs, and how environmental parameters influence fish metacommunity structures among different WLFs. Our results demonstrated significantly higher Richness, Pielou' evenness, Shannon-Wiener index, functional richness, and functional evenness in high water phase, which was probably due to high fish recruitments originating from floodplain rivers. The high abundance of riverine gudgeons in high water phase confirmed the enhanced fish dispersal processes from rivers to floodplain lakes which were triggered by flood pulses. Compared to the scenario of high-water level, our results demonstrated significantly lower taxonomic and functional diversity during low water phase with more abundant generalist fish species. Such changes were probably triggered by enhanced environmental filtering during the low water phase, since we detected significantly intensified environmental loadings in low water level. Water temperature, conductivity, total nitrogen, and phosphate phosphorus were retained as significant predictors of fish taxonomic and functional structures across different water levels, which suggested that WLFs influenced fish assemblages through physicochemical changes. The present findings highlighted the importance of sustaining natural WLFs as well as seasonal floods in high water for the fish recruitments in floodplain lakes.

Gastropod palaeohabitats of Miocene Lake Randeck Maar and its hinterland defined by an actualistic genus-level approach	LETHAIA												The Randeck Maar lake sediments from SW Germany were deposited during a climatic phase known as the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, providing a unique window into this last favourable period for a more thermophilous fauna in Central Europe. Previous palaeoecological reconstructions of Randeck Maar's environment focused on the flora and vertebrate fauna. Here, we present a palaeoecological analysis using gastropods as proxies by means of an actualistic genus-level approach. This approach is grounded in comparisons of habitat preferences between extant and fossil congeners and thus obviously requires a sound taxonomic framework. Despite being commonly applied in the literature, this approach has hardly been defined so far. Therefore, we thoroughly delineate it, exploring its applicability, potential and shortcomings. The molluscan fauna of Randeck Maar counts with 32 species of continental snails, mostly terrestrial pulmonates, related to the following palaeohabitats: littoral, supralittoral, rocky walls, shrubland, forests and open habitats. The gastropods indicate a warm-temperate climate with a dry season, in line with previous works on Randeck Maar's flora and vertebrates.					; Salvador, Rodrigo/F-7524-2012	Salvador, Rodrigo Brincalepe/0000-0002-4238-2276; Rasser, Michael W./0000-0003-0024-5561													0024-1164	1502-3931				APR	2020	53	2					229	241		10.1111/let.12353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/let.12353		SEP 2019											WOS:000487990300001
J	Buzzelli, C; Gorman, P; Doering, PH; Chen, ZQ; Wan, YS				Buzzelli, Christopher; Gorman, Patricia; Doering, Peter H.; Chen, Zhiqiang; Wan, Yongshan			The application of oyster and seagrass models to evaluate alternative inflow scenarios related to Everglades restoration	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The South Florida landscape is highly engineered featuring similar to 3380 km of canals, similar to 1225 water control structures, >70 pumping stations, managed wetlands, densely populated coastal watersheds, and impacted estuaries. Landscape scale agricultural and urban modifications require flood control which sometimes results in the release of excess freshwater that potentially damages estuarine ecology. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District focused on restoring natural patterns of freshwater flow to the Everglades and associated estuaries. One of the primary project goals is to reduce deleterious inflows eastward to the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) and westward to the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) by diverting freshwater south from Lake Okeechobee. Performance evaluation of the CEPP relies upon integrated modeling which links the watershed engineering projects to estuarine salinities and biotic responses. The objective of this study was to utilize seagrass and oyster models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative inflow scenarios. There are three different scenarios: the existing condition base (ECB), the future without proposed CEPP projects (FWO) but with other landscape features that could alter freshwater inflows, and alternative 4R (ALT4R) that incorporates a suite of restoration projects including those associated with the CEPP. Each of these inflow scenarios was used to generate daily salinity time series from 1965 to 2005 at multiple locations in the SLE and CRE which were used to run site-specific seagrass and oyster models. The hydrodynamic and ecological effects of freshwater inflow were greater in the SLE compared to the much larger CRE. Predicted densities of oysters (individuals m(-2)) and seagrass (shoots m(-2)) were greater in the wet season (May-Oct) vs. the dry season (Nov-Apr) in both estuaries. Oyster and seagrass densities increased under the ALT4R inflow scenario that mitigated high inflows to the estuaries in the wet season. This result improved environmental conditions while increasing freshwater availability for other parts of the Greater Everglades and the southern estuaries such as Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.

This conservation deposit is recorded in a 9 m-thick interval of laminite, microbialite, and grainstone deposited in a lake system with variable water level, alternating moments of hypersaline and freshwater conditions. Despite numerous studies describing new species of plants, arthropods, fish, pterosaurs, birds, and many others, there remains a signi ficant gap in our understanding of the most common and archetypal fossils, which are the rod-shaped macrofossils found on bedding surfaces in distinct stratigraphic intervals of the Crato Konservat-Lagerstiitte . The rodshaped macrofossils are up to 1.6 cm-long and 0.1 cm-wide, straight to curved compressions that preserve pyritized microfossils. Here we interpret the rod-shaped macrofossils as macroscopic organic aggregates that sank into the lakebed in a process called lake snow. During high organic productivity periods in the epilimnion, planktonic organisms thrived and produced exopolymers responsible for aggregation. Their concentrations in the limestone bedding planes re flect intensity of lake snow and environmental seasonality. Aggregates are prolate particles that are commonly oriented, suggesting their transport as bedload for short distances, which was facilitated by biostabilization by microbes and their exopolymers.

Fluctuations of the population of Daphnia laevis Birge 1878: a six-year study in a tropical lake	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The fluctuation of the population of Daphnia laevis in Lake Jacare (Middle River Doce, Minas Gerais) was monitored monthly (at one point in the limnetic region) for six years (2002-2007) as part of the Program of Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER/UFMG). The following parameters were also monitored: water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, phosphate, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and densities of Chaoborus and ephippia of Daphnia laevis in the sediment. A seasonal pattern was observed in the fluctuation of D. laevis, with higher densities recorded during periods of circulation (May-August). A significant correlation was found between the density of D. laevis and temperature (r = -0.47, p = 0.0001), chlorophyll-a (r = -0.32, p = 0.016) and indicators of the lake's trophic status (total phosphorus, r = 0.32, p = 0.007 and trophic state, r = 0.36, p = 0.003), as well as Chaoborus density (r = 0.43 and p = 0.002). These results indicate that changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the water related with stratification and circulation of the lake may have a direct (temperature, total phosphorous) or an indirect (food availability, presence of predators, ephippia eclosion) influence on the fluctuation of the D. laevis population.

Various types of rushes and underwater meadows were taken into consideration as lake microhabitats. The research was conducted in the shallow Lake widwie (NW Poland). Multivariate (constrained) ordination methods were used to analyse the relationships between species composition and environmental variables. In the lake and its margins 31 species of the Ostracoda were identified. The development of water vegetation during the vegetation season was conducive to growth in ostracod density. The accessibility of mud in plant habitats had a favourable effect on the general density of ostracods. Species which preferred a high mud content in their habitats included: Cypria ophtalmica, C. exsculpta and Physocypria kraepelini. Species typically encountered in underwater meadow habitats were: Cyclocypris ovum and Cypridopsis vidua. Underwater meadows of charophyte were characterized by the highest ostracod density in the whole lake system, with the average of 7860 ind. m2 and the maximum of 17 470 ind. m2. Species typically encountered in rush habitats included Notodromas monacha, Dolerocypris fasciata and Metacypris cordata. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim was to test whether the valves are built in isotopic equilibrium and how seasonal water temperatures are recorded in the shells, We find systematic offsets between delta(18)O of valve carbonate compared to delta(18)O expected for a theoretical calcite formed in isotopic equilibrium. Offsets are higher than +2 parts per thousand for different species of the Candona roup, +1.5 parts per thousand or Cytherissa lacustris, and around 0.8 parts per thousand for Limnocythere inopinata and Darwinula stevensoni. They seem to be constant for all instars of a species and temperature independent. Mean water temperatures of the calcification period are readily reflected in the valve-delta(18)O if corrected for the offsets. delta(13)C of valve carbonate is mainly controlled by delta(13)C of the dissolved carbonate in ambient lake water, but seems to be biased by micro-habitat effects and vital offsets.. The study provides information on the seasonality of valve formation, thus potentially allowing the quantification of temporal and spatial water temperature gradients from specific delta(18)O records.

Taxonomic composition, diversity, biovolume and abundance of phytoplankton were studied at 3 representative stations from March 2002 to March 2003, in relation to various climatic factors (wind, insolation), physical and chemical factors (temperature, conductivity, nutrients) and biological factors (zooplankton grazing). A total of 111 species of phytoplankton belonging to 7 algal classes were identified, predominately Chlorophyceae (32% of species) followed by Cyanobacteria (25%) and Bacillariophyceae (diatoms, 15%). From December to March, a period characterised by low temperature, solar insolation and north-easterly winds that mixed the water column, the community was dominated by the diatom Fragilaria sp. and cyanobacterium Anabeana miniata. From April to September, during higher temperatures, solar insolation and predominant north-westerly winds that mixed the water column less effectively, the community was dominated by cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Lyngbya versicolor. A statistical approach based on co-inertia analysis was used to describe the phytoplankton/ environment relationships, in particular the factors governing the presence of C, raciborskii. The phytoplankton community was characterised by a clear succession of species groups: Fragilaria sp.-A. miniata (November to March) -> Microcystis aeruginosa (March to May) -> C. raciborskii-L, versicolor (June to November). Finally, a functional approach originally designed for temperate zones was applied to the algal groups (11 functional groups), which gave valuable information on algal strategies in a shallow tropical lake.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				NOV 24	2006	45	2					147	161		10.3354/ame045147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame045147													WOS:000243038700005

The problems of water quality deterioration and water shortage can be alleviated by introducing water of higher quality. However, the mechanism of water replenishment in the improvement of the water quality and trophic status of lakes remains unclear. This study investigated water replenishment in Wuliangsuhai Lake (WLSHL) from 2011 to 2021 by collecting seasonal water samples and conducting laboratory analyses. Water replenishment was found to be capable of significantly improving lake water quality and alleviating eutrophication. It is worth noting that single long-term water replenishment measures have limitations in improving the water quality and trophic status. The whole process was divided into three stages according to the water quality and trophic status, namely the buffer period, decline period, and stable period. During the buffer period, the water quality and trophic status showed only slight improvement because of the small amount of water replenishment and the low proportion of higher-quality water from the Yellow River. In the decline period, with increasing water replenishment, the proportion of higher-quality water from the Yellow River gradually increased, leading to the most significant and stable degree of improvement. In the stable period, increases in the amount of water replenishment had little effect on improving the water quality and trophic status, which is attributable to the balance between internal pollutants (lake water-sediment), and the balance between internalexternal pollutants (lake water-irrigation return flow + Yellow River water). On the premise of stable water quality, with eutrophication control as the management goal, the optimal water replenishment would be approximately 10.58 x108 m3. Further necessary measures for solving aquatic environmental problems include the combination of sediment dredging, optimization of the water replenishment route, and implementation of quality management in water replenishment.

The model includes error terms for isotope ratios, diet proportions, and fractionation. The model accurately predicted temporal delta(15)N dynamics of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a diet-switch experiment but was less successful for delta(13)C, possibly because of variable fractionation. The model was then used in three heuristic applications. In a diet-validation scenario, a model derived from limited knowledge of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) diet reasonably estimated delta(13)C and delta(15)N compared with a null model but inaccurately estimated prey consumption. In a scenario where adult lake trout briefly cannibalized stocked lake trout fingerlings, the detectability of a cannibalism-induced delta(15)N increase depended on predator size, duration of cannibalism, and sample size. In a scenario where seasonal isotopic variability occurred at the base of a food web, variation propagated to higher trophic levels depended on consumer size and diet. Our approach is most valuable when used to examine multiple diet combinations that produce observed stable isotope ratios; one can then identify the most reasonable diets through field tests or other observations.

U.; Staehr, Sanjina U.; Tonetta, Denise; Hogslund, Signe; Nielsen, Mette Moller			Contribution of boulder reef habitats to oxygen dynamics of a shallow estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We assessed the importance of boulder reefs to the oxygen dynamics of a shallow estuary during two growing seasons in 2017 and 2018. Using open-system diel oxygen measurements and benthic and pelagic incubations, we evaluated the relative contribution of pelagic and benthic habitats to the ecosystem metabolism along a depth gradient in two areas, with (Reef) and without (Bare) boulder reefs in the Limfjorden, Denmark. System integrated areal rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) both increased with depth in both areas. Benthic contribution to system GPP and ER was highest at shallow depth where it represented 47 and 53% respectively. However, with increasing depth pelagic processes dominated GPP and ER (98 and 94%) even in the Reef area. Although the Reef area had higher biomass of auto- and heterotrophic organisms (macroalgae and macrofauna), benthic GPP was at similar level in both areas, due to a significant contribution from micro-phytobenthic organisms. The Reef area had lower sediment pools of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorous and was slightly more oxygenated compared to the nearby Bare area. Extreme temperatures and higher levels of nutrients in 2018 caused a marked increase in benthic ER rates resulting in net heterotrophy (NEM = GPP - ER 0) in 2018 compared to net autotrophy (NEM 0) in 2017. Under current eutrophic conditions, boulder reefs do not contribute positively to the oxygen dynamics in the estuary.

If CA does provide a better sustainability with adapted cropping patterns when adopted, a question is, whether CA is able to alleviate the impact of climatic variations thanks to the mulching effect and to which extent. We took the example of medium altitude zones in the Lake Alaotra area to illustrate farmers' perceptions. If climate change is not proven in these areas, climatic variations are very high and erratic rainfall patterns at the beginning of the rainy season induce serious risks of crop failure. Two surveys were implemented in 2013: (i) on CA changing practices of 92 farmers (during the 10 years project duration) and (ii) on the evolution of behavior among 28 farmers who have recently adopted CA (less than 5 years). In CA systems, the mulch contributes to better cropping systems resilience and helps alleviating the effect of climatic variations. If a limited number of farmers have effectively adopted CA practices, in the long run, most farmers have developed innovative cropping systems between conventional agriculture and CA, to address their own constraints, leading to a widespread range of agro-ecological practices. A typology of behavior is presented to identify farmers' strategies regarding risks in a context characterized by multiple uncertainties.

J	Cenderelli, DA; Wohl, EE				Cenderelli, DA; Wohl, EE			Peak discharge estimates of glacial-lake outburst floods and "normal" climatic floods in the Mount Everest region, Nepal	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the Mount Everest region of Nepal on 3 September 1977 and 4 August 1985 dramatically modified channels and valleys in the region by eroding, transporting, and depositing large quantities of sediment for tens of kilometers along their flood routes. Prior to this research, the GLOF discharges had not been determined and the hydrology of "normal" climatic floods (SHFFs: seasonal high flow floods) was not known. A one-dimensional step-backwater flow model was utilized, in conjunction with paleostage indicators, to estimate the peak discharges of the GLOFs and SHFFs and to reconstruct the hydrology and hydraulic conditions of the GLOFs at 10 reaches and SHFFs at 18 reaches. The most reliable GLOF and SHFF peak discharge estimates were upstream from constrictions where there was critical-depth control. The peak discharge of the 1977 GLOF at 8.6 km from the breached moraine was approximately 1900 m(3)/s. At 7.1 km downstream from the breached moraine, the 1985 GLOF discharge was estimated at 2350 m(3)/s. At 27 km downstream from the breached moraine, the 1985 GLOF attenuated to an estimated discharge of 1375 m(3)/s. The peak discharges of SHFFs ranged from 7 to 205 m(3)/s and were positively correlated with increasing drainage area. The GLOF discharges were 7 to 60 times greater than the SHFF discharges with the greatest ratios occurring near the breached moraines. The downstream decline in the ratio between the GLOF discharge and SHFF discharge is the result of the downstream attenuation of the GLOF and the increased discharge of the SHFF because of increased contributing drainage area and the increased effects of monsoonal precipitation at lower elevations.

Spatial distributions of alpine grasses, however, are not well documented in this remote, highly uninhabited region. Taking advantage of the frequently observed moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (500-m, 8-day) in 2010, this study extracted the phenological metrics of alpine grasses from the normalized difference vegetation index time series. With the Support Vector Machine, a multistep classification approach was developed to delineate alpine meadows, steppes, and desert grasses. The lakes, permanent snow, and barren/desert lands were also classified with a MODIS scene acquired in the peak growing season. With ground data collected in the field and aerial experiments in 2011, the overall accuracy reached 93% when alpine desert grasses and barren lands were not examined. In comparison with the recently published national vegetation map, the alpine grassland map in this study revealed smoother transition between alpine meadows and steppes, less alpine meadows in the southwest, and more barren/deserts in the high-cold Kunlun Mountain in the northeast. These variations better reflected climate control (e.g. precipitation) of different climatic divisions on alpine grasslands. The improved alpine grassland map could provide important base information about this cold region under the pressure of rapidly changing climate.					; Liao, Jiajun/AAL-3864-2021; Guo, Huadong/G-9388-2017	liao, jing juan/0000-0002-5915-2661; zhang, yili/0000-0002-9474-1664; Guo, Huadong/0000-0003-0337-1862													1753-8947	1753-8955				FEB 1	2015	8	2					133	152		10.1080/17538947.2013.860198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2013.860198													WOS:000348507600004

Most species showed similar patterns of occurrence in both basins while having differences in abundance. Several rotifer species were more abundant in FC sites most of the year, while for microcrustaceans higher abundances in FC sites only happened during the first 2 months. Their distribution is attributed to the presence of higher nutrient levels in FC sites as well as wind-induced basin-wide water movements during the different monsoon seasons which disperse plankton and nutrients from FC sites to other parts of the lake. Zooplanktonic indicators, such as the Brachionus-Trichocerca quotient (Q(B/T)) and the ratio of calanoids to cladocerans and cyclopoids, clearly demonstrate the eutrophic state of the lake. A comparison with previous studies suggests that the lake was already eutrophic prior to the introduction of aquaculture in the 1970s. The trophic conditions in Lake Taal may be attributed to the lakes' tropical and volcanic nature, with productivity further enhanced by increased nutrient input from aquaculture.					; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022	Papa, Rey Donne/0000-0003-0146-2525; 													0018-8158					APR	2011	664	1					119	133		10.1007/s10750-010-0591-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0591-2													WOS:000288562800009

In this study, we analysed T4-type phage communities in an upland black soil by monitoring g23 clones in DNA extracted from seasonal soil samples with no fertilizer, chemical fertilizers, chemical fertilizers plus manure, and natural restoration treatments. PCR products with degenerate primers MZIA1bis and MZIA6 were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. In total, 46 clones with different g23 sequences were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that T4-type phage communities in the upland black soil were distinctly different from those in marine environments and in an Antarctic lake, which strongly suggested that T4-type phage communities in soil differed from those in aquatic environments. Among 46 clones, 18 clones formed clusters with the clones from rice field soils, 14 clones formed three new clusters, and 13 clones were left as ungrouped, which indicated that T4-type phage communities in the upland black soil were relatively similar to those in rice field soils but that specific communities also inhabit in the upland black soil exclusively.					wang, guang hua/ADE-3570-2022; Wang, Guanghua/ADE-3570-2022; Liu, Xiaobing/AAQ-3881-2020; 于, 镇华/AAR-6878-2021	wang, guang hua/0000-0003-4737-8126; 													0178-2762	1432-0789				APR	2011	47	3					273	282		10.1007/s00374-010-0533-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-010-0533-1													WOS:000288251700004

Daily variations in temperature, pH, calcium concentration, and alkalinity were measured at seasonal intervals from September 1993 to January 1995 in two small woodland streams with lengths of 1.0 and 1.5 km. The principal cause of supersaturation in these fast-growing streams is inorganic carbon dioxide outgassing from resurging groundwater, locally enhanced by turbulence at waterfalls and cascades. Photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide and temperature effects are negligible. Nonetheless, organic substrates, particularly cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats and biofilm, significantly localize precipitation by providing suitable nucleation sites. Precipitation rates on artificial substrates, up to 2.2 mm/yr on limestone, correlate with high Saturation Index values. Copper substrates inhibited microbial colonization and received negligible encrustation. Tufa formation and external calcium carbonate encrustation of cyanobacteria are conspicuous where the annual WATEQ4F Saturation Index exceeds 0.8, and are slightly below 0.7. Calcium carbonate impregnation of cyanobacterial sheaths has not been observed. We infer that in these fast-flowing streams cyanobacteria utilize CO2 in photosynthesis whereas elsewhere, in sluggish freshwater, cyanobacteria utilize HCO; leading to sheath impregnation by calcium carbonate even where Saturation Index is only I 0.2-0.3. Thus, photosynthetic influence on cyanobacterial calcification appears to be negligible in fast-flowing CO2-rich streams and cyanobacterial calcification takes the form of external encrustation. In slow-flowing CO2-poor streams and lakes cyanobacteria preferentially utilize bicarbonate and sheath impregnation can result. Modern tropical marine carbonate shelves have saturation indices commonly in the range 0.62-0.82 and cyanobacterial calcification is negligible. Extrapolation suggests that cyanobacterial calcification could occur in present-day seas if Saturation Index exceeded 0.8. This level, corresponding with heavy calcification in the freshwater streams studied, may have been widespread in marine environments in the geological past at times when calcified cyanobacteria and environmentally influenced non-skeletal calcium carbonate precipitates were abundant.

Subtropical stormwater ponds are more frequently net nitrogen fixing compared to natural ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Urban stormwater ponds (SWPs) are engineered ecosystems designed to prevent flooding and protect downstream ecosystems by retaining nutrients associated with stormwater runoff, including nitrogen (N). Despite these expectations, multiple studies have found that SWPs have low N removal efficiencies and can be sources of N to downstream ecosystems. To understand mechanisms controlling the fate of N in SWPs, we quantified dinitrogen (N2) gas saturation to characterize net N2 exchange as either net denitrification or net N-fixation. We assessed temporal and spatial patterns of N2 dynamics in fifteen SWPs and six naturally occurring ponds in undisturbed watersheds (Florida, USA) by sampling in two seasons (dry and wet) and from multiple depths of the water column. Samples from SWPs were equally likely to exhibit N2 supersaturation (net denitrification; 50%) or undersaturation (net N-fixation; 50%). In contrast, the majority (82%) of samples from natural ponds were supersaturated with N2, indicating net denitrification. The mean SWP air-water N2 flux was - 1.7 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1 (range - 500 to 433 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1), which was lower than clear (40 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1; range - 68 to 74 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1) and humic (202 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1; range 41 to 407 mu g N2-N m-2 h-1) natural ponds despite considerably higher variation in SWPs. These results indicate that SWPs may have low N removal efficiencies in part due to N-fixation adding new N to the system. Overall, this study shows that SWPs are less effective than natural ponds at removing reactive N from the environment, potentially impacting downstream water quality.

Historically, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have negatively affected the aquatic environment and the health of surrounding residents. In this study, the pollution status and environmental fate of OCPs in multiple environmental media in the Huixian wetland were investigated. The 15 OCPs' total concentration ranges in lake water, ditch water, groundwater, and lake sediment were 46.8-306 ng center dot L -1 , 77.8-251 ng center dot L -1 , 26.0-233 ng center dot L -1 , and 44.8-345 ng center dot g - 1 , respectively. The concentrations and proportions of the different OCPs demonstrated significant seasonality. Historical residues are the main source of OCPs in the region, as evidenced by the typical ratios of DDTs and HCHs. Karst regions are extremely vulnerable to environmental changes, as evidenced by the highly dynamic character of the karst wetland system and the rapid migration of multimodal OCPs in different media without considerable damage. According to the risk assessment, both the possible carcinogenic risk to sediments in the Huixian wetland and the ecological risk to water bodies were acceptable. In contrast, the consumption of lake water may put the local population at health risk, which is a cause of concern.

Climate-driven changes in water level: a decadal scale multi-proxy study recording the 8.2-ka event and ecosystem responses in Lake Sarup (Denmark)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A two-stage change in lake level during the 8.2-ka event was identified in Lake Sarup, Denmark (55A degrees N), using a multiproxy approach on precise radiocarbon wiggle-matched annually laminated sediments deposited 8740-8060 cal. yr BP. Changes in delta C-13 and delta O-18 indicated closed lake hydrology driven by precipitation. The isotopic, sedimentary and plant macrofossil records suggested that the lake level started to decrease around 8400 cal. yr BP, the decrease accelerating during 8350-8260 before an abrupt increase during 8260-8210. This pattern shows that the climate anomaly started similar to 150 years before the onset of the 8.2-ka cooling event registered in Greenland ice cores, but was synchronous with hydrologic change in the North American Lake Agassiz drainage. The lake level decrease was accompanied by a higher accumulation rate of inorganic matter and lower accumulation rates of cladoceran subfossils and algal pigments, possibly due to increased turbidity and reduced nutrient input during this drier period. Pigment analysis also showed added importance of diatoms and cryptophytes during this climate anomaly, while cyanobacteria became more important when the water level rose. Moreover, Nymphaeaceae trichosclereids were abundant during the period of algal enrichment. Cladoceran taxa associated with floating leaved plants or benthic habitats responded in a complex way to changes in water level, but the cladoceran assemblages generally reflected deep lake conditions throughout the period. The lake did not return to its pre-8.2-ka event status during the period of analysis, but remained more productive for centuries after the climatic anomaly as judged from the pigment accumulation and assemblage composition. The change to more eutrophic conditions may have been triggered by erosion of marginal deposits. Together, these data confirm the chronology of hydrologic changes and suggest, for the first time, that lake levels exhibited both a decline and an increase in rapid succession in response to the 8.2-ka event in southern Scandinavia.

A semi-mechanistic seasonal temperature-profile model (STM) for the period of stratification in dimictic lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A semi-mechanistic seasonal temperature-profile model (STM) for stratified lakes was successfully tested with six Ontario data sets. The STM has eight parameters: the days of year for the start and end of stratification and the midsummer surface temperature peak (T-X*); the temperature at the onset and end of stratification and T-X*; the seasonal development of the thermocline depth (two parameters); and the steepness of the depth transition from epilimnion to hypolimnion. The STM was fitted using nonlinear least squares with R-2 ranging from 0.91 to 0.99 and root mean square errors of 0.80 to 1.42 degrees C. Residuals were evenly distributed with respect to date and depth with 69.4% to 95.9% +/- 1.0 degrees C. On average, observed-estimated temperature differences range from -0.24 to -0.03 degrees C and + 0.16 to + 0.37 degrees C for estimated temperatures of 5 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Simulations with daily data sets showed the STM fit was insensitive to reductions in the length of sampling duration and sampling frequency. Several STM parameters were well-estimated by published equations based on morphometric, climatic, and location variables.					; Minns, Charles/GYU-2209-2022; Shuter, Brian/A-3991-2008	Shuter, Brian/0000-0002-3733-6005; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2013	70	2					169	181		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0253													WOS:000316017500004
J	Strauch, AM				Strauch, Ayron M.			Interactions between soil, rainfall, and wildlife drive surface water quality across a savanna ecosystem	ECOHYDROLOGY												Surface water resources play an important role in the transportation of nutrients within and between regions. Water quality varies spatially across landscapes, but the extent of this variability and the interaction between water quality and wildlife are not well-known. In some savannas, heterogeneous climatic and geologic patterns result in gradients of precipitation and soil nutrients, leading to temporal and regional differences in soil and vegetation quality. Wildlife utilise these seasonal patterns, influencing soil nutrient dynamics and vegetation. However, the impact of seasonally abundant wildlife, climate, and soils on surface water quality is unknown in savannas. Fluctuations in surface water quality were measured across the Serengeti ecosystem at 6-month intervals, and the influence of rainfall, watershed, and seasonal wildlife migration were then modelled. The results suggest that although soil composition in watersheds influences the concentration of soil-derived nutrients in rivers, rainfall and wildlife have a significant effect on the seasonal concentrations of most nutrients. The role of migratory wildlife in surface water quality in some watersheds is likely dampened by the large influence of resident species across seasons and habitats. The alteration of rainfall patterns by climate change is expected to influence nutrient transport into savanna rivers.

However, long-term seasonal monitoring of BPP is limited, leaving us with little information on the cause, directionality, and consequences of the potential shifts in timing of BPP life cycle events. Here, we review the literature on the phenological changes of BPP and show that BPP respond primarily to temperature, but also to other interactive drivers related to climate change and eutrophication. In addition, we present four rare case studies where BPP display strong and earlier shifts in event timing associated with increasing temperature and discuss potential impacts of these changes on ecosystem functioning. Given the responsive nature of BPP to multiple human drivers, we provide suggestions on how to improve basic monitoring to better understand the future impact of phenological changes of this critical habitat.

An upward-looking 600 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) moored at a fixed 22 m station in the lake recorded acoustic backscatter continuously during the study period. Zooplankton samples collected indicated that the abundance of C. punctipennis larval instars accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in the linear backscatter from the ADCP. The large fourth-instar larvae underwent normal diel vertical migration throughout the study. Smaller second-instar larvae underwent reverse migration during late June but switched to normal migration by late July. The acoustic record indicates that the switch occurred over a few days around late June, and at this time a double vertical migration appeared with the second instars leading and following the migration of fourth instars. We speculate that these changes in the migration of second instars are driven by seasonal shifts in predation risk from larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) and by the need to minimize spatial overlap with the larger fourth instars.					; wells, mathew/A-7101-2012	wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2014	71	5					665	674		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0440													WOS:000334921000003

Responses of P. lenticularis to a changing lake environment therefore have potential implications for the calcium carbonate flux in lakes. How meteorological variability in interaction with the CaCO3 saturation state may influence the abundance and phenology of P. lenticularis has not been investigated so far. We measured, biweekly to daily, algal abundance, CaCO3 saturation, pH, water temperature and nutrient status in three hard-water lakes that varied in lake morphology and wind exposure. Our data provide evidence that increasing supersaturation of CaCO3 mediates the onset of P. lenticularis exponential growth and stimulates seasonal peak development. However, total cell concentration in the lake water appears to be independent of the CaCO3 saturation state and was the highest in the most wind exposed lake. Phacotus lenticularis abundance and epilimnetic CaCO3 supersaturation were significantly positively correlated at a time lag of about 1 day. Wind caused an immediate decline in epilimnetic pH followed by a decline in CaCO3 saturation about 2 days later. Solar irradiance positively affected both pH and water temperature, but water temperature changes were insufficient to produce a significant CaCO3 saturation response. We conclude that the CaCO3 saturation state is a determinant factor driving the timing of P. lenticularis peaks in alkaline lakes.

In the Brealito Member, aquatic species (mainly freshwater algae) dominate the palynoflora, while terrestrial species are represented by trilete spores (mainly Anemiaceae) and gymnosperm pollen grains. In the Don Bartolo Member, Classopollis spp. dominate most of the assemblages, trilete Anemiaceae spores constitute half of the total counts in one of the assemblages and a unique angiosperm species (Tricolpites variabilis) was found in two assemblages. Ephedra-type pollen grains (three genera and six species) appear in both members, although in low abundance. The results support previous sedimentology studies that indicate a perennial lake environment at the time of deposition of the Brealito Member, with evidence for dry seasonality in the Don Bartolo Member.

The mean body length of cladoceran species occurring at different latitudinal intervals was greatest in north temperate regions, declining in size toward the poles and equator. Thus, mean cladoceran size was greatest in regions where the mean annual surface temperatures of lakes ranged from 6 to 8 degrees C in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The date of maximum Daphnia abundance and the period of minimum Daphnia abundance in lakes of North America was positively, linearly related to the latitudinal position of the lakes. The date of maximum abundance increased with latitude such that Daphnia peaked during nearly all months of the year depending on latitude, but usually within the same, narrow temperature range (15-20 degrees C). The period of minimum Daphnia abundance decreased linearly with latitude such that abundance generally was minimal when water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2000	45	1					22	30		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0022	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0022													WOS:000084949600003

Trophic ecology of the exotic Lerma livebearer Poeciliopsis infans (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae) in the Lago de Patzcuaro, Central Mexico	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Exotic fish species has caused several impacts on aquatic biodiversity. The Lago de Patzcuaro has some well-studied exotic species, except the Lerma livebearer Poeciliopsis infans. This fish species was introduced into the Lago de Patzcuaro before 1997 and the aspects of its biology are still unknown. In this study we assessed aspects of the trophic ecology of this exotic fish, P. infans, using gut content and stable isotope analysis to understand its capacity to tolerate anthropogenic environmental degradation in the Lago de Patzcuaro. We also determined its trophic guild position (TP) using the TrophLab Program and stable isotope. Niche breadth was calculated by standardized Levins' Index (Bi). Fish was captured with a seine during wet and dry seasons at six environmentally different sites and gut contents were obtained. We analyzed a total of 239 gut contents of P infans. The contribution of each food item in the diet was quantified using frequency of occurrence and area percentage. The importance of each prey item was determined according to the index of relative importance (IRI), and the omnivory index (OI) was used to assess the feeding behavior. Fish were categorized by size and the diet was compared between fish sizes and sites. Dorsal muscle tissue and water hyacinth tissue was obtained for nitrogen isotope signature (delta N-15) analysis. Additionally, we measured water and habitat quality to evaluate environmental conditions at each site. We concluded that P. infans is an omnivore (OI=0.28) that consumes mainly detritus (44%), epiphytic diatoms (37%), and secondary on terrestrial insects (6%) and zooplankton (10%). The fish can behave as a specialist (Bi=0.39) or generalist (Bi=0.68) and as a primary consumer (TROPH=2.2; TP=2.3) with a feeding strategy that was the same at different sizes, seasons and sites. None of the evaluated sites showed good environmental quality. We argue that P infans can tolerate changes in water quality and feeding items availability, because it can exploit resources in multiple trophic webs. However, this species could be dependent on habitat complexity, especially in the aquatic vegetation cover.					; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/Q-8229-2018; Ramirez, Juan Pablo/ITU-5096-2023	Balart, Eduardo F./0000-0001-8752-1017; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0204-1482; 														2215-2075				SEP	2013	61	3					1289	1300											24027924					WOS:000324509200023

Food web consequences of size-based predation and vertical migration of an invertebrate predator (Leptodora kindtii)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In an intensive study of the vertical and horizontal distribution of zooplankton in a eutrophic lake (Katepwa Lake), we found that only adult Leptodora kindtii (> 5 mm in body size) exhibited diel vertical migration (DVM), whereas juvenile Leptodora (< 5 mm) and other zooplankton species did not. Even though a longitudinal survey of five lakes (1994-2004) indicated that variation in Leptodora density was correlated with several indicators of habitat use (e.g., water temperature) and resource availability (e. g., zooplankton abundance), feeding experiments performed in both lit and unlit conditions demonstrated that a vertebrate predator (perch) strongly reduced Leptodora abundances under all conditions and always preferentially selected large-bodied individuals. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the migratory behavior of large Leptodora is consistent with an anti-predator defense strategy. To estimate the ecological significance of Leptodora DVM behavior, we modeled how predation rates on different zooplankton taxa differed between day and night in Katepwa Lake. We found that Leptodora had as much as five-fold higher prey-specific predation rates at night, particularly for intermediatesized prey. We conclude that ignoring the habitat use, size-structure, and vertical migration behavior of Leptodora could considerably underestimate the significance of invertebrate predation in lake food webs, particularly in eutrophic lakes where Leptodora can coexist at high densities with planktivorous fish.					; Matthews, Blake/B-5608-2009; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Cobb, Tyler/0000-0002-8202-9143; Matthews, Blake/0000-0001-9089-704X; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2013	58	5					1790	1801		10.4319/lo.2013.58.5.1790	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.5.1790													WOS:000327393800019

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												The chemical composition of secretions of precloacal pores from two populations of the lizard Liolaemus fabiani (Puilar and Punta-Brava) were compared. This is an endemic species from the Atacama Salt Flat (26degrees46'S 68degrees14'W;2400 m) in northern Chile, restricted to the internal lakes of the salt flat. Interpopulational differences in the chemical composition of the secretions were expected considering that populations have genetic differences and are subject to different thermal conditions. By using GC-MS, a total of 44 compounds were found belonging to three categories: n-alkanes, long-chain carboxylic acids, and steroids. Six compounds were found in all the individuals studied: tetradecanoic, pentadecanoic, hexadecanoic, hexadecenoic, octadecanoic, and octadecenoic acids. The secretions of both populations had similar types and proportions of the different compounds, except for cholesterol and hexanoic acid, which were more abundant in the Puilar population.

Zooplankton succession on seasonal floodplains: surfing on a wave of food	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Floodplains represent ecotones with frequent high productivity mediated by regular shifts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We examined interactions along this intercept on a seasonal floodplain of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We focused on the zooplankton communities in order to gain knowledge on the energetic and stoichiometric interplay of the two systems involved. A conspicuous horizontal migration and pulsed biomass increase was found for the dominant zooplankton species ( Moina micrura, Daphnia laevis, Mesocyclops leuckarti), culminating in truly extreme numbers before a final collapse. There was a distinct succession in the peak abundance of these species, apparently subsidized by hatchlings from the seed bank of resting eggs as the flood proceeded over the savannah. The high productivity of the system seems to be driven by a strong coupling of the terrestrial and aquatic phase of the floodplains via a mobilization of terrestrially derived nutrients, through nutrients from grazing ungulates during dry periods. Carbon of terrestrial origin, however, appeared to be of minor importance for the planktonic part of the food web.

J	Heinrichs-Caldas, W; de Almeida-Val, VMF				Heinrichs-Caldas, Waldir; Fonseca de Almeida-Val, Vera Maria			Hypoxia tolerance in two amazon cichlids: mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism adjustments are result of species environmental preferences and distribution	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												The amazon fishes' responses to hypoxia seem to be related to the Amazon basin diversity of aquatic environments, which present drastic daily and seasonal variations in the dissolved oxygen concentration. Among these fishes' adaptation to hypoxia, behavioral, metabolic, physiological, and biochemical responses are well known for some species. In this work, we aimed to identify how two different aquatic environments, normoxic forest streams and hypoxic lakes, dictate the responses to hypoxia for two cichlid species, Mesonauta festivus and Aequidens pallidus. In our results, we found that A. pallidus is less tolerant to hypoxia, which seems to be related to this animal's natural normoxic environment. Even though this species modulated the mitochondrial respiration in order to improve the oxygen use, it also showed a lower decrease in metabolic rate when exposed to hypoxia and no activation of the anaerobic metabolism. Instead, M. festivus showed a higher decrease in metabolic rate and an activation of the anaerobic metabolism. Our data reveal that the natural dissolved oxygen influences the hypoxia tolerance and the species' tolerance is related to its ability to perform metabolic depression. The interest results are the absence of mitochondrial respiration influences in these processes. The results observed with A. pallidus bring to light also the importance of preserving the forests, in which streams hold very specialized species acclimated to normoxia and lower temperature. The importance of hypoxia tolerance is, thus, important to keep fish assemblage and is thought to be a strong driver of fish biodiversity.					; de Almeida e Val, Vera/J-5818-2014	Heinrichs-Caldas, Waldir/0000-0002-5052-9282; 													0920-1742	1573-5168				DEC	2021	47	6					1759	1775		10.1007/s10695-021-01000-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-01000-0		SEP 2021						34480679					WOS:000692431100001

Movement of a South American perch Percichthys trucha in a mountain Patagonian lake during spawning and prespawning periods	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Movement of the South American perch Percichthys trucha (Perciformes: Percichtllyidae) was studied in a set of interconnected mountain lakes in northern Patagonia. F'ish were tracked using attached acoustic tags and a fixed hydrophone array over two seasons, corresponding to the spawning (1999) and prespawning periods (2000). Percichthys trucha was found to move throughtout the lake system. and to use a small. shallow, connected lake as a principal spawning area. In addition, detailed behavioural information was obtained for the spawning period. Most fish spent the initial 2 weeks descending from the littoral zone to depths of 5-8 m, presumably while feeding. Fish changed depth slowly, spending several days at each depth. and moving throughout the lake. A few days prior to the full moon, there was a change in behaviour thought to be associated with spawning. where the fish moved toward the vegetated littoral areas. Marked daily behaviour also began at this time, with movement to particular near-shore locations at dusk, and return to slightly greater depths offshore at or before dawn. Study of the behaviour of P. trucha during, the breeding season has highlighted the conscrvation significance of the main locations within the lake system.

The effects of wind events on phytoplankton dynamics were investigated in two temperate reservoirs. 2. Meteorological forcing, change in physical and chemical structure of the water column and biological responses of phytoplankton communities were followed for 3 weeks in three seasons. 3. Depending on the season, the phytoplankton response differed in response to nutrient and light conditions, and to the intensity of stratification and mixing. 4. We demonstrated that, on a time scale of a few days, wind events can modify phytoplankton dynamics, in terms of size structure and exported biomass. An increase of mixing favoured the largest size class and disadvantaged the smallest size class, while an increase in stratification had the opposite effects. The short-term change in size structure was reflected in the sedimentary fluxes but with a time lag.					; Lagadeuc, Yvan/AAH-9472-2019	Pannard, Alexandrine/0000-0003-2997-5744; Bormans, Myriam/0000-0002-4755-6327													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2007	52	1					12	27		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01667.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01667.x													WOS:000242660200002

Stable nitrogen isotopes of plankton and benthos reflect a landscape-level influence on great lakes coastal ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As populations and human activities increase in coastal watersheds, an understanding of the connections of aquatic ecosystems to the adjacent terrestrial landscape is necessary to identify, monitor, and protect vulnerable coastal habitats. This study investigates the relationships between land-use patterns and (delta N-15 values of aquatic organisms in coastal ecosystems, across a defined watershed gradient for the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes shoreline. delta N-15 measured in plankton and benthic invertebrates reflects a range of basin wide land-use gradients and demonstrates a strong connection between watershed-based anthropogenic activities and exposure in aquatic biota. For example, benthos a delta N-15 values range over 12 parts per thousand across sites in our study, but regression analyses suggest that over 50% of the variability is explained by the regional landscape. Further, multiple taxa at comparable trophic position showed similar patterns in relation to watershed-scale land use. Our results suggest that within the coastal environment, the expression of landscape in aquatic biota is stronger in habitats such as embayments and wetlands than open nearshore. These results support the use of delta N-15 in Great Lakes coastal biota as an exposure indicator of watershed-scale N loading.																			0380-1330						2007	33				3		27	41		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[27:SNIOPA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[27:SNIOPA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000254896200003

In this study, we used fluorescently labeled particles (FLP) as Synechococcus-sized mimics to examine the contribution of pigmented (may include autotrophic and mixotrophic spp.) versus non-pigmented (heterotrophic) nanoflagellate grazing to Synechococcus morality. During the warm season from June to September, > 50% of the nanoflagellate population was pigmented (1.8-2 x 10(3) versus 1.2-1.6 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)). Consumption, or clearance rates per pigmented nanoflagellate, varied considerably (0.50-46.90 nL cell(-1) h(-1)), with the highest rates in June. Raw data showed pigmented nanoflagellate grazing to account for 2-94% (mean 43%) of Synechococcus production from May to October. Pigmented nanoflagellates consumed 12.5-fold more Synechococcus than did ciliates. This study provides the first evidence that pigmented nanoflagellates are key grazers of Synechococcus populations in subtropical western Pacific coastal waters.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	2007	29	1					71	77																WOS:000245354000007

The common cichlid species Sarotherodon melanotheron was collected in both systems over 16 months (June 2001 to September 2002) at five locations. We quantified reproductive traits from macroscopic examination of the gonads, oocyte counts and measurements, and growth from interpretation and measurements of an otolith sub-sample. There was a clear seasonal cycle of reproduction in the estuaries with a peak at the beginning of the wet season (May-July). Size at maturation was smaller in the more saline environment, the Saloum, for both females (170 mm in Gambia and 131 mm in Saloum) and males (162 and 113 mm respectively). The relative fecundity was lower and the oocyte size was bigger in the freshwater location of the Gambia river. Growth, estimated by counting the annual opaque zones on whole otoliths, was reduced in the hypersaline environment of the Saloum (L-infinity = 198 mm, K = 0.26). Differences are less obvious between the growth in the Gambia (L-infinity = 238 mm, K = 0.21) and that in the Saloum with a salinity of less than 60 (L-infinity = 244 mm, K = 0.22). All these observations suggest that S. melanotheron is able to withstand saltier environments by limiting its growth, reducing the size-at-maturity, and changing its fecundity, but the most profound changes are only visible in hypersaline conditions.

In the present study, the chemical composition related to water-soluble ions and elements was assessed in both water and sediment samples collected from the area of interest during July 2017 and October 2017, representative months for warm and cold seasons, respectively. Water-soluble ions (H3C2O2-, HCO2-, C2O42-, F-, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3-, SO42-, Li+, Na+, NH4+, K+, and Ca2+) were analyzed by ion chromatography, while inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to quantify water-soluble fractions of elements (Be, B, Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, Ba, Ir, Tl, Pb, Bi, and U). Evidence was obtained on the contributions of both anthropogenic and natural (pedologic) related sources in controlling the chemical composition of the water and sediment samples in the area. Analysis of Piper diagrams revealed the existence of CO32-/HCO3- and Ca2+/Mg2+ as dominant species for the sediment samples. The interest water pool was found to be oligotrophic over the warm period and eutrophic over the cold period. Overall, abundances and the association of chemical species in the area seemed to be controlled by a complex interplay between the water body's main characteristics, meteorological factors, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, the present results suggest that precautions should be taken for physicochemical parameter monitoring and prevention acts for surface water quality assurance in order to control the potential negative influence of some chemical parameters on fish productivity. Reported data also have a high potential to be used by experts in the field of developing lake water management policies for a sustainable exploitation of various aquatic systems.

The physical and chemical limnology of Yukon's largest lake, Lhu'aan Man' (Kluane Lake), prior to the 2016 'A'ay Chu' diversion	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Despite increasing evidence that large northern lakes are rapidly changing due to climate change, descriptive baseline studies of their physicochemical properties are largely lacking, limiting our ability to detect or predict change. This study represents a comprehensive scientific assessment of the limnology of Yukon's largest lake: Lhu'aan Man' (Kluane Lake), an important waterbody for local and First Nation communities, and key habitat for trout and salmon. Water sample and instrument data generated throughout 2015 describe distinct regions within the lake and their respective seasonal variability. A deep, glacially-influenced southern basin was characterized by cold, turbid, poorly stratified, unproductive, and nutrient-poor conditions; a shallower northwestern region (Tthe Kaala Daagur (Brooks/Little Arm)) was warmer, fully mixed, and more productive; a northeast region ('Uha K'enji (Talbot/Big Arm)) was clear and stratified with intermediate depth, temperature, productivity, and nutrient concentrations; and a central region had intermediate physicochemical conditions relative to the other three. This variability demonstrates the need for adequate spatial (within lake) and temporal (between seasons) monitoring of large northern lakes. In 2016, glacier recession within the watershed resulted in diversion of the lake's primary inflow ('A'ay Chu' (Slims River)). Our results, when used together with Indigenous knowledge, form a historical reference that enables assessments of the potential ecological consequences to Lhu'aan Man'.

Non-parametric seasonal Kendall and Mann-Kendall tests, Sen slope estimator, and potential energy anomaly (PEA) were applied. The lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) of SY and DC increased at the same rate (0.125 degrees C/y), followed by those of CJ (0.071 degrees C/y) and PD (0.06 degrees C/y). Seasonally, the LSWT increase rates for all lakes, except PD, were 2-3 times higher than the air temperature increase rates. The lake stratification intensity order was similar to those of the LSWT increases and correlations. SY and DC displayed significant correlations between LSWT (0.99) and PEA (0.91). Thus, the LSWT significantly affected stratification when the water temperature increased. PD demonstrated the lowest correlation between LSWT and PEA. Inflow, outflow, rainfall, wind speed, and retention time were significantly correlated, which varied within and between lakes depending on lake topographical, hydraulic, and hydrological factors. Thus, hydraulic problems and nutrients should be managed to minimize their effects on lake water quality and aquatic ecosystems because lake cyanobacteria can increase as localized water temperatures increase.																				2073-4441				SEP	2021	13	17							2341	10.3390/w13172341	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13172341													WOS:000694509800001

Few low-cost techniques are avail-able for rehabilitating gullies. The objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of a low-cost horizontal sub-surface drainage system for decreasing gully erosion by stabilizing gully banks. The study was conducted in the sub -humid Ethiopian highlands in two active gullies, one in a Vertisol and another in a Nitisol. One bank was drained with a plastic pipe, and the other bank acted as the control. The two opposite banks are hydrologically isolated from one another. The surrounding groundwater tables were continuously monitored for two years. Over two wet seasons, the average bank retreat in the Vertisol gully was 0.62 m for the control and 0.15 m for the drained bank. Similarly, in the Nitisol gully, in 1.1 m for the control and 0.29 m for the drained bank. The average groundwater table of the drained bank was 20% lower than the non-drained banks during the monitoring periods. These results suggest that bank dewater-ing maintained higher levels of stability of gully banks and promoted lower rates of bank retreat on both soil types. The initial cost of the dewatering treatments was significantly less than the conventional bank stabilization measures. Bank dewatering could be one of the technologies for gully rehabilitation. Gully management techniques in Ethiopia and else-where could benefit from integrating bank drainage with other physical and biological protective measures.																				1338-4333				SEP	2021	69	3					311	318		10.2478/johh-2021-0019	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2021-0019													WOS:000685284600007

Touhidul; Pan, Shijun			Assessment of spawning habitat suitability for Amphidromous Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) in tidal Asahi River sections in Japan: Implications for conservation and restoration	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The Amphidromous Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), vital for Japan's riverine commercial fisheries, is experiencing population decline due to habitat degradation. In response, Japan is implementing restoration efforts by releasing juvenile fish and cultivating spawning habitats. This study, focusing on the Asahi River's Heidan area, evaluates Ayu spawning habitat suitability, especially in tidal zones, and its conservation implications. Through field surveys and numerical analysis, the research identifies optimal conditions for spawning amid dwindling numbers. Observations from the 2020 peak spawning season showed that water temperatures below 20 degrees C are conducive to spawning, with the best sites producing up to 48,817 eggs/m(2). Gravel sizes between 0.85 and 53.0 mm were identified as crucial for effective spawning. Notably, artificial spawning grounds established in 2019 showed no spawning activity, likely due to saline intrusion from tides. Using the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-aquatic ecosystem numerical model, the study assesses flow, substrate, and water quality's impact on spawning, corroborated by sensor data. A key finding is the negative correlation between salinity and egg density in tidal sections of the Asahi River. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based YOLOv5 model, trained on underwater images, effectively detected Ayu aggregations, demonstrating an F1-score of 0.757 in differentiating Ayu from other coexisting fish species in the same aquatic environment. This AI approach provides a nonintrusive method for monitoring Ayu populations and habitat preferences. The research underlines that successful spawning habitats require minimal saline intrusion, with optimal salinity and flow conditions. These insights are critical for spawning ground development, emphasizing the management of tidal effects and riverbed conditions to bolster Ayu populations and preserve aquatic ecosystems.					; Yajima, Hiroshi/AAE-1959-2021; Pan, Shijun/JMC-8745-2023	Yajima, Hiroshi/0000-0002-0361-1080; Islam, Dr. Md.

This study investigated the relationship between water quality and the occurrence and diversity of macrophyte species of the wetland. Spatio-temporal variability in terms of water quality and macrophytes were studied in the wet and dry seasons at purposely-selected sites selected based on human disturbance levels. Six sites were selected, two from each of 'severely', 'moderately' and 'least disturbed', and data collected on water quality parameters, macrophytes richness and abundance. The results showed 25 macrophyte species dominated by Cyperaceae (24%), Poaceae (20%) and Nymphaeaceae (12%). Species diversity and abundance were significantly different between seasons and among the sampling sites (p < 0.05), with the richest taxa recorded at the least disturbed sites. A redundancy analysis of the species-environment relationships identified nutrient loads as significant drivers of macrophyte diversity and abundance in the wetland. Generally, the results showed the spatial and temporal variation of macrophyte diversity and abundance are affected by water quality, and poor water quality has resulted in poor ecological conditions of the Cheleleka Wetland.					; Dullo, Bikila Warkineh/AGX-9560-2022	Tesfaye, Haymanot/0000-0003-2152-8894; Dullo, Bikila Warkineh/0000-0002-8488-4020													1608-5914	1727-9364				JAN 2	2022	47	1					36	46		10.2989/16085914.2021.1940823	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2021.1940823		AUG 2021											WOS:000691477500001

Although investment in sexual stages is often synchronized with seasonal cycles, the degree of investment is a quantitative trait associated with habitat instability. Populations of cyclic parthenogens from stable environments, such as large lakes and oceans, generally show reduced or undetectable investment in males. Indeed, males of many species of lacustrine cyclic parthenogens are unknown to science. Methyl farnesoate (MF), a crustacean juvenile hormone, has been implicated as an inducer of male formation in Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Cladocera), a denizen of unstable habitats with marked sexual recruitment. Here, we show experimentally that MF induces male production in four distantly related lacustrine species of cladocerans under growth conditions unfavourable for male production. The males of three species are new to science. Unlike females, the anatomy of the previously unknown males of Bosmina (Lunobosmina) oriens permitted ready morphological diagnosis of sibling species and subfossils.

A total of 32 groundwater samples were collected from 16 stations via piezometers and boreholes at the end of both the dry (June 2021) and wet (October 2021) seasons. Utilizing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), and in situ metering, 22 physicochemical and 24 heavy metal parameters were analyzed. The data revealed significant levels of contamination; notably, sample GW11 had extraordinarily high concentrations of total dissolved solids (10,826 mg/L), strontium (908 mu g/L), molybdenum (802.4 mu g/L), zinc (6060 mu g/L), and electrical conductivity (15,645 mu S/cm), while GW12 exhibited elevated levels of aluminum (2615 mu g/L), zinc (4446 mu g/L), and arsenic (117.2 mu g/L). Contaminants such as arsenic, vanadium, gallium, lithium, rubidium, chromium, manganese, copper, and zinc were found enriched in groundwater near Lake Beseka, majorly influenced by geogenic activities, volcanic ash, and weathering of rocks. The sampled waters might be affected by human activities including agricultural runoff from sugarcane plantations, sugar factories wastewaters, and agro-industry activities (decade's activities). Over half of the groundwater sources were unsuitable for drinking, posing significant health risks to local communities that rely heavily on these sources due to limited access to clean surface water. The findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive groundwater management and remediation plans in the Middle Awash region to ensure safe and sustainable water use, particularly addressing the variation in contamination levels influenced by Lake Beseka. These measures are critical to protect public health and support local development in the face of ongoing environmental and anthropogenic pressures.					; Wolde, Behailu/JFS-6878-2023; Agumassie, Tena/AAL-3707-2021; Prof., Esayas/AAK-1907-2020	Alamirew, Tena/0000-0001-7491-4401; Berehanu, Behailu/0000-0003-2607-334X; Alemayehu, Esayas/0000-0001-8843-1136; 														2071-1050				JUN	2024	16	12							5257	10.3390/su16125257	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16125257													WOS:001255989300001
J	Latifovic, L; Arain, MA				Latifovic, Lejla; Arain, M. Altaf			The impact of spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) defoliation on carbon balance of a temperate deciduous forest in North America	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Temperate deciduous forests are an important contributor to the global carbon (C) sink. However, changes in environmental conditions and natural disturbances such as insect infestations can impact carbon sequestration capabilities of these forests. While, insect infestations are expected to increase in warmer future climates, there is a lack of knowledge on the quantitative impact of these natural disturbances on the carbon balance of temperate deciduous forests. In 2021, a record-breaking defoliation, caused by the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar (LDD), formerly knows as the gypsy moth) occurred in eastern North America. In this study, we assess the impact of this spongy moth defoliation on carbon uptake in a mature oak-dominated temperate forest in the Great Lakes region in Canada, using eddy covariance flux data from 2012 to 2022. Study results showed that the forest was a large C sink with mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 207 +/- 77 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from 2012 to 2022, excluding 2021, which experienced the infestation. Over this period mean annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was 1,398 +/- 137 g C m(-2) yr(-1), while ecosystem respiration (RE) was 1,209 +/- 139 g C m(-2) yr(-1). However, in 2021 due to defoliation in the early growing season, annual GEP of the forest declined to 959 g C m(-2) yr(-1), while annual RE increased to 1,345 g C m(-2) yr(-1) causing the forest to become a large source of C with annual NEP of -351 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The forest showed a rapid recovery from this major disturbance event, with annual GEP, RE, and NEP values of 1,671, 1,287, and 298 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively in 2022 indicating that the forest was once again a large C sink. This study demonstrates that major transient natural disturbances under changing climate can have a significant impact on forest C dynamics. The extent to which North American temperate forests will remain a major C sink will depend on the severity and intensity of these disturbance events and the rate of recovery of forests following disturbances. Lay abstract: Temperate deciduous forests play an important role in carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. However, the impact of climate change, extreme weather, and disturbance events can alter the extent to which these forests sequester carbon, in some cases shifting their role from being a carbon sink to becoming a carbon source to the atmosphere. In 2021, a spongy moth infestation severely defoliated a mature oak-dominated temperate forest north of Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada, turning the forest from a 10-year mean carbon sink of about 2 tons of carbon per hectare to a carbon source of about 3.5 tons of carbon per hectare. Our analysis indicates that meteorological conditions during the early growing season might have influenced the severity of this infestation. Specifically, the prevalence of dry and warm weather conditions enabled the moth to survive and thrive longer. This study shows the significant influence of natural disturbances on forest carbon dynamics as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change. The future role forests play in carbon sequestration will be determined by the severity of disturbance events and the effectiveness of forests to recover in the aftermath of these events.					; Arain, M./ABA-9750-2020	Arain, M.

K.; Mercan, Oya			Resolution Dependence of Extreme Wind Speed Projections in the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The effect of anthropogenic climate change on extreme near -surface wind speeds is uncertain. Observed trends are weak and dif fi cult to disentangle from internal variability, and model projections disagree on the sign and magnitude of trends. Standard coarse -resolution climate models represent the fi ne structures of relevant physical phenomena such as extratropical cyclones (ETCs), upper -level jet streaks, surface energy fl uxes, and land surface variability less skillfully than their high -resolution counterparts. Here, we use simulations with the NCAR Community Earth System Model with both uniform (110 km) resolution and the variable -resolution con fi guration (VR-CESM-SONT, from 110 to 7 km) to study the effect of re fi ned spatial resolution on projections of extreme strong and weak wind speeds in the Great Lakes region under end -of -century RCP8.5 forcing. The variable -resolution con fi guration projects strengthening of strong -wind events in the re fi ned region with the opposite occurring in the uniform -resolution simulation. The two con fi gurations provide consistent changes to synoptic -scale circulations associated with high -wind events. However, only the variable -resolution con fi guration projects weaker static stability, enhanced turbulent vertical mixing, and consequentially enhanced surface wind speeds because boundary layer dynamics are better captured in the re fi ned region. Both models project increased frequency of extreme weak winds, though only VR-CESM-SONT resolves the cold -season inversions and summertime high temperatures associated with stagnant wind events. The identi fi able mechanism of the changes to strong winds in VR-CESM-SONT provides con fi dence in its projections and demonstrates the value of enhanced spatial resolution for the study of extreme winds under climate change.

J	Özçelik, S; Tekin-Özan, S				Ozcelik, Sule; Tekin-Ozan, Selda			Evaluation of selected heavy metal and selenium pollution in water and sediments of Lake Eğirdir (Isparta/Türkiye) using statistical analysis and pollution indices	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The purpose of this study is to assess heavy metal and selenium pollution in water and sediment of Lake E & gbreve;irdir using some indices. The water and sediments have the highest content of Fe. According to Water Quality Index (WQI) results, the lake water is in the good category, while the low pollution category depends on HPI and HEI values. The Enrichment Factor (EF) showed that the sediments contained very high, extremely high and significant levels of Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Fe. The Geoaccumulation Index (I-geo) revealed that Lake E & gbreve;irdir was not polluted with Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn. Based on the results of the Contamination Factor (CF), Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn were in the low contamination category. The results of The Pollution Load Index (PLI) for lake sediments indicated no contamination for all metals in all seasons. Sediment quality guidelines were used to determine the possible risk of heavy metal contamination of sediments, and the results show that Cd and Pb were at the minimal effect threshold (MET), while Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were at the lowest effect levels (LEL). These results indicate that precautions should be taken to prevent an increase in metal pollution and reduce the existing pollution.

J	Wang, H; Li, ZH; Chen, L; Li, DL; Jiang, YC				Wang, Hui; Li, Zhenghao; Chen, Lian; Li, Dongliang; Jiang, Yuanchun			The Disparity in Normalized Difference Vegetarian Index Response to Climate Warming and Humidification in the Tibetan Plateau before and after 1998	REMOTE SENSING												The Tibetan Plateau (TP) serves as a crucial ecological barrier in Asia, with vegetation playing a pivotal role in the terrestrial ecosystem by facilitating energy exchange between the land and atmosphere, regulating climate, and participating in the carbon cycle. In this study, we analyze the characteristics of surface vegetation on the TP in the growing season during 1982-2018 using satellite remote sensing data obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). We investigate how these characteristics respond to climate change under different warming and humidification conditions across the TP. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values on the TP exhibit a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest during the growing season. There is a significant overall increasing trend at a climate tendency rate of 0.01<middle dot>decade(-1) (p < 0.01) from 1982 to 2018, characterized by a notable mutation of around 1998. Over the past 37 years, a polarized trend of vegetation was observed on the TP, with notable improvement in its central and eastern regions. However, there has been noticeable degradation in northwestern TP, specifically within the Kunlun Mountains and Qaidam Basin. (2) The climate of the TP demonstrates distinct regional disparities in terms of warming and humidification characteristics before and after 1998. During the period of 1982-1998 (1998-2018), the temperature increase is primarily concentrated in the northern (southern) TP, while precipitation increase is mainly observed in the southern and northwestern (northeastern and western) regions of the TP. (3) The responses of surface vegetation to climate factors exhibit significant variations across diverse climatic backgrounds. It is noteworthy that moisture conditions have a substantial impact on the response of vegetation to air temperature on the TP. During the period of 1982-1998, under relatively insufficient moisture conditions, a positive correlation was observed between air temperature and surface vegetation in the humid and semi-humid regions of the southeastern TP, while a negative correlation was found in the semi-arid regions of northeastern TP. During 1998-2018, as moisture conditions became relatively sufficient, surface vegetation in the semi-arid regions showed positive correlations with both temperature and precipitation. However, surface vegetation in the humid and semi-humid regions exhibited a significant negative correlation with precipitation. During this period, the synergistic effects between warm and humid climates in the semi-arid regions of northeastern TP and warm and dry climates in humid and semi-humid regions of southeastern TP substantially enhanced surface vegetation on the TP. Furthermore, our results indicate that thermal factors (air temperature) primarily influence variations in surface vegetation within the high-altitude arid region of the TP. During 1998-2018, a significant cooling trend was observed in the northwestern TP, which could potentially account for the degradation of surface vegetation in the Kunlun Mountains. The findings of this study establish a scientific basis for the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems on the TP.

Some large water reservoirs are constructed in karstic carbonate areas. In order to understand underground circulation in the limestone/dolomite foundation of the Vouglans dam (Jura, France), groundwater chemistry analysis, according to geological conditions, is used. Statistical analyses (PCA and DFA) are carried out: (1) to accurately characterize the contrast in chemical composition resulting from the interaction between surface and groundwater in a poorly contrasted environment, due to the shared carbonated context, and (2) to reassign individuals into homogeneous groups with respect to the variables studied. PHREEQC is used to determine the potential for the precipitation of secondary minerals from the water chemistry mainly in order to determine the geochemical control of clogging. Three types of hydrodynamic behavior were identified in the sector. The origin and transfer time of inflows vary with respect to seasons. The area of influence of the rapid transit of the lake water varies predominantly in response to changes in the lake water level. The hydrostatic pressure of the water column influences the opening and closing of cracks at the bottom of the dam. Drains intercepting an upstream fissure are highlighted by hydrochemical measurements. Inflows are oversaturated with respect to calcite and are thus likely to precipitate this mineral. Zones with a strong clogging capacity correspond to the zones with slow transit groundwater.

Functional variability of dissolved organic matter from the surface water of a productive lake	WATER RESEARCH												Functional variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the surface water of Esthwaite Water (N. England) was investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays, which provide quantitative information on light absorption, fluorescence, photochemical fading, pH buffering, copper binding, benzo(a)pyrene binding, hydrophilicity, and adsorption to alumina. Ten lakewater samples were collected at different times of year during 2003-2005, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid was used as a quality control standard. For nine of the assays, variability among DOM samples was significantly (p < 0.01) greater than could be explained by analytical error. Seasonal trends observed for six of the assays could be explained by a simple mixing model in which the two end-members were DOM from the catchment (allochthonous) and DOM produced within the lake (autochthonous). The fraction of autochthonous DOM predicted by the model is significantly correlated (p<0.01) with chlorophyll concentration, consistent with production from phytoplankton. Autochthonous DOM is less light-absorbing, less fluorescent, more hydrophilic, and possesses fewer proton-dissociating groups, than allochthonous material. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the intricate interplay between electrolyte concentrations and seasonal fluctuations along with their impact on the persistence of organic constituents remains insufficiently elucidated. This study utilized PASS-treated FFT (i.e., permanent aquatic structure storage) from Lake Miwasin to address these questions. Experiments were conducted to investigate the desorption of organics from FFT into lake water under different conditions, including FFT dosage, contact time, temperature, and ionic strength. Results revealed that higher FFT dosage and lake water organic matter led to increased desorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), while temperature and conductivity of the lake water had minimal effects. The presence of electrolytes regulated the equilibrium desorption capacity of DOC, with cations (K+ and Ca2+) significantly affecting the desorption process from negatively charged treated FFT particles. Temkin isotherms displayed that desorption dynamics followed physically favorable patterns whereas the Intraparticle diffusion kinetic model suggested the equilibrium desorption capacity of DOC as 0.65 mg/g of PASS-treated FFT. A small percentage (5.82 %) of the DOC and less than half of naphthenic acids (NAs) (39.1 %) in PASS-treated FFT were potentially released. The distribution coefficient value of DOC and NAs was comparably high, indicating that DOC and NAs were mostly stable within the PASS-treated FFT deposition. The study reflects considerable stability of PASS-treated FFT about the physical and chemical conditions of the lake water, making them a promising alternative in FFT management.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of climate change on streamflow in Joumine watershed, upstream the Ichkeul Lake, a RAMSAR wetland and the most productive ecosystems in Tunisia and the Mediterranean. The hydrologic response of the basin was simulated based on Hydrologic Modelling System HEC-HMS. Climate data were generated from the emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from the Irish Regional Climate Model (RCM) for the periods 2030-2060 and 2061-2100. The statistical analysis showed that model performance is satisfactory, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.7 and 0.64 for calibration and validation, respectively. The climate projections exhibited a declining trend in precipitation during the two future periods with more frequent extreme rainfall events in dry season and a rise in temperature which is more accentuated during the period 2061-2100. Climate change is expected to have profound impacts on water resources and resilience of ecosystems. Results showed that Joumine basin is projected to experience reduction in streamflow which is more pronounced under RCP8.5. The frequency and magnitude of hydrological extremes are expected to be intensified, notably during the far future period, leading to pressure on water availability in the end of the twenty-first century. Hence, sustainable water resources management is needed to close the water demand and supply gap in the Joumine river basin.

Research demonstrates that excessive water level fluctuations impair ecosystem functioning, ultimately leading to shifts between clear-water and turbid states in shallow lakes. However, these data lack for Manjirenji Dam in Zimbabwe, thus hampering efforts towards effective freshwater resources management in the shallow reservoir. This study analyzed water levels and their fluctuations, and assessed the effects of climatic factors and catchment dynamics using a combination of historical and remote sensed data for the shallow Manjirenji Dam in Zimbabwe. Time series and multiple regression analysis were used to determine water level trends, and the influence of catchment and climatic components in Manjirenji Dam. Lake levels have increased since construction, though their non-significant seasonal variation in the Manjirenji Dam reflects the overlapping effects of catchment and climatic variables. Despite the inferred high stability and resilience, the high fluctuation widths expose the dam to hydrodynamic and climate shocks which have major ecological and conservation implications. A climate change based integrated water resources management approach is necessary for sustainable water resources utilisation in the Manjirenji Dam.

To investigate the impact of nitrogen (N) fertilization on seasonal variance in AM colonization and soil erosion, we conducted a field experiment with rice cultivation under four N fertilizer levels (0 kg N ha(-1), 270 kg N ha(-1), 300 kg N ha(-1), and 375 kg N ha(-1) plus organic fertilizers) in the Taihu Lake region, China. We investigated AM colonization before rice transplantation, during rice growth, and after rice harvest. We also assessed soil splash erosion of intact soil cores sampled at tillering and after rice harvest. We found that AM colonization (indicated by percentage of root length colonization) varied from 15 to 73%, which was attributed to rice growth, N fertilization, and their interaction. Soil loss due to splash erosion was cut down by organic N fertilizer at tillering, while higher inorganic N fertilization significantly increased soil loss after rice harvest. Additionally, we found significantly negative relationships of AM colonization to soil loss but positive relationships to soil aggregate stability. We highlighted the potential role of AM fungi in decreasing soil erosion and suggested that high N fertilization should be considered carefully when seeking after high yields.

Our objective was to characterize the dominant solid phase materials and diagenetic processes controlling metal(loid) solubilities, and thus their potential release to the overlying water column. Aqueous and solid concentrations of metal(loid) contaminants were examined along with distinct species of Fe and S within sediments and interstitial water. A gradient from oxic conditions at the sediment-water interface to anoxic conditions below 15 cm exists at all sites, resulting in a dynamic redox environment that controls the partitioning of contaminants. Fluvial deposition from frequent seasonal flood events bury ferric oxides residing at the sediment-water interface leading to reductive dissolution as they transition to the anoxic zone, consequently releasing associated metal(loids) to the interstitial water. Insufficient sulfur limits the formation of sulfidic minerals, but high carbonate content of this mining region buffers pH and promotes formation of siderite. Diagenetic reactions create chemical gradients encouraging the diffusion of metal(loids) toward the sediment-water interface, thereby, increasing the potential for release into the overlying water.

J	van Straaten, P				van Straaten, P			Mercury contamination associated with small-scale gold mining in Tanzania and Zimbabwe	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					5th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	MAY 23-28, 1999	RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL	Ctr Miner Technol, Canadian Int Dev Agcy, Brazilian Res Council, Elect Power Res Inst, Res Support Fdn				Mercury contamination associated with small-scale gold mining and processing represents a major environmental and human health concern in Eastern and Southern Africa. Approximately 200000-300000 persons are involved in small-scale gold mining activities in Tanzania and >200000 persons in Zimbabwe. Mercury (Hg) is used mainly for the processing of primary gold quartz veins and supergene gold mineralizations. Gravimetric material flow analyses show that 70-80% of the Hg is lost to the atmosphere during processing, 20-30% are lost to tailings, soils, stream sediments and water. For every 1 g Au produced, 1.2-1.5 g Hg are lost to the environment. Cumulatively, the anthropogenic Hg released annually into the atmosphere is approximately 3-4 t in the whole Lake Victoria Goldfields of Tanzania and >3 t in Zimbabwe. Tailings are local 'hot spots' with high concentrations of As, Pb, Cu and Hg. Lateral and vertical dispersion of Hg lost to soils and stream sediments is very limited (laterally <260 m, vertically <20 cm). Dispersion of mercury from tailings is low because Hg is transported largely in the elemental, metallic form. In addition, Fe-oxide rich laterites and swamps appear to be natural barriers for the dispersion of metals in soils and streams. Ground and surface water quality data indicate very low dispersion rates during the dry season. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

D.; Pernthaler, Jakob			Spatial microheterogeneity and selective microbial consumption of dissolved free amino acids in an oligomesotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the cm to m scale spatial distribution of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) in the upper epilimnion of oligomesotrophic Lake Zurich in 14 sampling campaigns over > 3 years and at various periods of the growing season. During each campaign, 10 sets of 10 simultaneously drawn samples (10 mL, 2 cm distance) were collected from 5 m depth. DFAA concentrations varied by one to > 3 orders of magnitude within sets, providing field evidence for DFAA release from macroscopic point sources and for substantial variability of the in-situ growth conditions of bacterioplankton metacommunities. There was a tight relationship between the median DFAA concentration per sampling campaign and the compositional heterogeneity of the 15 most common AA: their composition was similar in samples from campaigns with high median DFAA concentrations, indicating that spatial distribution patterns were mainly a result of physical mixing. By contrast, AA composition was spatially variable in campaigns with low median DFAA concentrations, and serine, aspartate, and glycine were disproportionally high in the 10% samples with highest DFAA concentrations. We hypothesized that pelagic bacteria would preferably target pulses of such locally overrepresented AA. Short-term incubations with radiolabeled tracers revealed substantially higher microbial uptake of serine and, to a lesser extent, aspartate, than of two amino acids with consistently low in situ concentrations (leucine, isoleucine). This illustrates a "preparedness" of the bacterioplankton to preferably incorporate those AAs that are more available in DFAA hotspots.

Particle tracking showed that lateral hyporheic area (planimetric area of flow paths lateral to the stream that are recharged by and return to the stream with travel times of 10 days or less) differed between the two study streams and varied with discharge within each system. At the Rio Calaveras (welded tuff), lateral hyporheic area ranged from 1.7 to 4 m(2) over the annual cycle. In the Aspen Creek system (sandstone), lateral hyporheic area (1-1.5 m(2)) was restricted to roughly half of that observed at Rio Calaveras. The size of the hyporheic zone lateral to the streams at both sites decreased by approximately 50% during high flows. Sensitivity analyses indicated that changes in the hydraulic conductivity of alluvial and streambed sediments and variation in recharge rates have greatest impact on the magnitude, direction, and spatial distribution of stream-groundwater exchange.																			0043-1397					MAR	1998	34	3					317	328		10.1029/97WR03285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97WR03285													WOS:000072273000001

In Ontario, three distinct viticultural regions are experiencing climatic shifts towards warmer growing seasons. According to historical records collected from Environment and Climate Change Canada, Lake Erie North Shore has transitioned from an intermediate -to -warm growing season classification, the Niagara Peninsula from the lower to upper limits of the intermediate zone, and Prince Edward County from cool to intermediate, when analyzing their average growing season temperatures. Terroir is directly related to vine water status, an indicator of grapevine stress. Biophysical responses controlled by air temperature and precipitation include fluctuations in vapour pressure deficits, evapotranspiration, and water -use -efficiency rates, as well as soil water content levels. By conducting an extensive literature review, the development of a conceptual model addresses how variations in climatic controls, under the scope of climate change, may influence grapevine water status, biophysical responses, and associated production outcomes for Ontario vineyards. Cool -to -intermediate air temperatures, when paired with increased precipitation will lead to no or low vine stress, increasing photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and variable plant water -use -efficiency levels, producing higher yields and lower quality grapes, if no management strategies are applied. Oppositely, higher air temperature as a product of climate change, when paired with variable precipitation may produce mild -to -severe stress, reducing yield, and increasing grape quality. With the appropriate management strategies, both traditional and new, growers may be able to accommodate for the influence of climate change on their vineyards.

However, at least in Europe, most systematic surveys post-date the onset of human-induced pressures on aquatic ecosystems, and thus fail to capture earlier degradation to water chemistry and flora and fauna, which were already advanced. Paleolimnological methods can be used to assess a range of anthropogenic stressors, but variability within a system is often smoothed to give long-term patterns. Here, we compile monitoring, documentary, and archival records from a range of sources to extend our understanding of centennial-scale lake ecosystem change and recovery from increasing salinity. We use a case study of the Thurne Broads shallow lake coastal wetland system (Broads National Park, UK), which has been subjected to multiple pressures of anthropogenic land drainage and North Sea storm surges (primarily in 1938 and 1953 CE) that have influenced salinity. Although there are still periods with significant data gaps and the interactions with eutrophication remain unclear, we demonstrate that historical data sources can be used in combination to observe seasonal patterns and extend knowledge on past salinity change and macrophyte community structure back to the 1800s. A demonstrable change in the ecosystem is observed after the sea flood of 1938 CE, when salinity levels in parts of the Thurne Broads were close, or equivalent, to seawater. With the added anthropogenic pressures of the late 1900s, the system has failed to fully recover. Future management, whilst balancing the needs of multiple users, should focus on the current large seasonal fluctuations in salinity and the vulnerability of the system to future large salinity increases.

Rediscovery of a lost Lagerstatte: a comparative analysis of the historical and recent Mare aux Songes dodo excavations on Mauritius	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												The Mare aux Songes (MAS), Mauritius, Mascarene Islands, is best known for the remarkable quality and quantity of macro- and micro-fossil remains, including those of the iconic Dodo Raphus cucullatus. It remains the most productive oceanic island fossil locality in the Indian Ocean, and is considered an integrated vertebrate bone Konzentrat-Lagerstatte. Fossil remains were first discovered in September 1865, again in the 1890s and early 1900s, but all without contextual data. The discovery of additional fossil remains in 2005 initiated an international, interdisciplinary research programme in 2006, which resulted in the first contextual analysis. However, it became clearly apparent that the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century fossil collections differed both in taphonomy and in age from late twentieth- and twenty-first-century excavations, and that it was likely that each represented a different depositional setting. Here, we provide evidence for the genesis of the MAS and show that two different fossil deposits were indeed present, each differing significantly taphonomically. Furthermore, the historical material represents a younger, seasonally desiccated, lake-shore accumulation with age range from ca. 1600 yr bp to sub-recent, whereas the 4200-year-old twenty-first-century material is more associated with a deeper, lacustrine environment.

J	Semyalo, R; Nattabi, JK; Larsson, P				Semyalo, Ronald; Nattabi, Juliet K.; Larsson, Petter			Diel Vertical Migration of zooplankton in a eutrophic bay of Lake Victoria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) of several zooplankton taxa and an important zooplanktivore Rastrineobola argentea in a eutrophic bay of Lake Victoria for a total of 3 months during wet and dry seasons. Zooplankton were sampled twice a month at full moon and new moon. The zooplankton community of this lake was numerically dominated by cyclopoid copepods ( > 80%) of which 80% were juveniles. The composition of zooplankton was not significantly different (P > 0.05) for the different sampling months (November 2000, March 2001 and July 2001), but total zooplankton abundance was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in July (dry season) than during March or November (wet seasons). DVM behaviour was observed in some of the zooplankton groups including Tropocyclops spp., Thermocyclops spp., Thermodiaptomus galeboides and Diaphanosoma excisum. In these groups, we also observed that they were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant at full moon than at new moon in some months, a pattern not seen in non-DVM groups. The amplitude of migration tended to be higher at new moon than full moon for all DVM zooplankton but not significantly so (P > 0.05). The zooplanktivore R. argentea exhibits typical DVM behaviour, perhaps to avoid visual predation itself, but it also increases the predation pressure on zooplankton in deeper waters. Feeding times for R. argentea peak just after dusk and dawn. For the copepod calanoid T. galeboides, there was a strong relationship (P < 0.05) between the amplitude of migration and midday (12: 00) water transparency, suggesting that these zooplankton may have descended deeper on days with higher water transparency. In the absence of temperature and food gradients but with predation pressure from a migrating zooplanktivore, the depth of descent of zooplankton may be well associated with water transparency.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2009	635	1					383	394		10.1007/s10750-009-9931-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9931-5													WOS:000270652200034

Here we employ a novel approach called "successional state dynamics'' (SSD) to model a seasonally forced predator-prey system. We first generated analytical predictions of the effects of altered seasonality on species persistence and the timing of community state transitions. We then parameterized the model using a zooplankton-phytoplankton system and tested quantitative predictions using controlled experiments. In the majority of cases, timing of zooplankton and algal population peaks matched model predictions. Decreases in growing-period length delayed algal blooms, consequently delaying peaks in zooplankton abundance. Predictions of increased probability of predator extinction at low growing-period lengths were also upheld experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of the SSD modeling approach as a framework for predicting the effects of altered seasonality on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic communities.					; Klausmeier, Christopher/J-9339-2012; Huber, Veronika/AAI-1638-2019	Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332; Klausmeier, Christopher/0000-0002-6987-5871; Huber, Veronika/0000-0001-9633-2752; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				NOV	2009	90	11					3099	3107		10.1890/08-2377.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-2377.1								19967865					WOS:000271457300013
J	Baehr, MM; DeGrandpre, MD				Baehr, MM; DeGrandpre, MD			In situ pCO2 and O2 measurements in a lake during turnover and stratification: Observations and modeling	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Sensors for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and dissolved O-2 (DO) were deployed near the surface and bottom of a freshwater lake (Placid Lake, Montana) during the period from ice cover to seasonal stratification. Sources of variability were examined using one-dimensional physical and biogeochemical models. Model predictions for pCO(2) and DO were compared to further constrain model parameters. A number of transient processes were documented that have not been well characterized in previous studies. The models made it possible to link these short-term events to specific forcings. We found that (1) 11 d of the 13-d turnover period occurred under ice through light-driven convective mixing, (2) phytoplankton biomass increased to its highest seasonal level under ice, (3) weak stratification set up immediately after ice-out, causing bottom water pCO(2) and DO to diverge from surface levels, (4) subsequent diel convective mixing brought bottom pCO(2) and DO back toward surface levels, and (5) before stable stratification, vertical entrainment of CO2-rich water, net production, and air-water exchange drove 100-200 muatm daily changes in pCO(2) but, because of their counterbalancing effects, surface pCO(2) remained > 1,000 muatm for nearly I month after ice-out. Upon stable stratification, net production and air-water exchange overcame pCO(2) gains from mixing and heating and reduced pCO(2) to near atmospheric levels within 20 d. Net production and gas exchange accounted for similar to75% and 25%, respectively, of the decrease in surface pCO(2) observed after ice-out. Diel convection was the dominant mixing process both under ice and after ice-out and may be an important underrepresented mechanism for CO2 and DO exchange between surface and bottom water.

We report on a survey of the extant terrestrial gastropod faunas of the Laetoli-Endulen area, examine their ecological associations and re-examine the utility of Pliocene fossil molluscs in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Standardised collecting at 15 sites yielded 7302 individuals representing 58 mollusc species. Significant dissimilarities were found among the faunas of three broad habitat types: forest, woodland/bushland and open (grassland and scattered, xeric shrubland). Overall, more species were recorded in the woodland/bushland sites than in the forest sites. Open sites were less diverse. Environmental factors contributing most strongly to the separation of habitat types were aridity index and elevation. The results are supplemented with new mollusc data from the Mbulu Plateau south of Lake Eyasi, and compared to the list of species cumulatively recorded from the Ngorongoro area. Some regional variation is apparent and historical factors may explain the absence of some fossil taxa from Laetoli today. Differences in seasonality separated upland forest sites on the Mbulu plateau from those at Lemagurut at Laetoli. Indicator species were identified for each habitat. These included several large-bodied species analogous to the Laetoli Pliocene fossil species that were then used for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Based on the estimated aridity index, and adopting the widely used United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) global climate classification, the four stratigraphic subunits of the Upper Laetolil Beds (3.6-3.85 Ma) would be placed in either the UNEP's Dry Sub-humid or Semi-arid climate classes, whereas the Upper Ndolanya Beds (2.66 Ma) and Lower Laetolil Beds (3.85-<4.36 Ma) would be assigned to the Humid and Semi-arid climate classes respectively. Pliocene precipitation at Laetoli is estimated as 847-965 mm per year, refining previous estimates. This is close or slightly higher than the present mean annual precipitation, and is likely to have corresponded to a mosaic of forest, woodland and bushland within a grassland matrix consistent with other reconstructions.

Relationship between gill raker morphology and feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Bigheaded carps and especially silver carp have been considered as an effective biological control for algal blooms, thus were introduced to several countries in the last decades, including Hungary. Our aim was to explore the feeding habits of bigheaded carps in Lake Balaton (Hungary), where the stock consists mainly of hybrids (silver carp x bighead carp). We examined the relationship between filtering apparatus (gill raker) morphology and size-distribution of planktonic organisms in the food. We failed to find any significant relationship between gill raker parameters and plankton composition in the filtered material. Bigheaded carps with various types of gill rakers consumed food within the same size- spectrum, independently of the rate of hybridization. However, the linkage between the proportion of different planktonic size classes in the water and in the diet of fish was detectable in case of both phytoplankton and zooplankton consumption, suggesting that the seasonally variable availability of different food items was an important factor in determining the food composition of bigheaded carps. We can deduce that bigheaded carps consume high amounts of zooplankton to meet their energy requirements, and the diet overlap among bigheaded carps and other planktivores may exert negative effects on native fish populations.

J	Bloszies, C; Forman, SL				Bloszies, Chris; Forman, Steven L.			Potential relation between equatorial sea surface temperatures and historic water level variability for Lake Turkana, Kenya	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water level in Lake Turkana, Kenya in the past ca. 150 years is controlled primarily from the biannual passage of the East and West African Monsoon, with rainfall volume related partially to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Western Indian and East Atlantic oceans. Empirical orthogonal function analyses show significant correlation between Eastern Atlantic or Western Indian SSTs and lake level anomalies, with the first mode accounting for 66% and 55% of the variability. The primary geographic loadings are consistent with a Gulf of Guinea moisture source and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) state. The second mode explains 10% of variability, and reflects the westward extension of an Indian Ocean cool pool, potentially indicative of a normal to a negative IOD state. There is significant spatial correlation between basin rainfall anomalies associated with Eastern Atlantic SSTs and a low in the continental divide between the Kenyan and the Ethiopian Highlands, which is a passage for moisture from the Congo Basin. Linear regression analysis with Bootstrap sampling and Monte Carlo simulations define numeric relations between Western Indian and Eastern Atlantic SSTs and lake level change for AD 1992-2013. The monthly and yearly lake level reconstructions based on this numeric analysis capture the decadal-scale variability and the 15 m drop in water level in the early 20th century. Meter-scale variability in lake level since ca. AD 1930 is associated with precipitation sourced from the Western Indian Ocean with IOD variability, whereas the 15 m drop in water level in the early 20th century may reflect a profound decrease in moisture from Atlantic/Congo Basin source. These numerical solutions are poised to reconstruct water level variations in the past ca. 300 years for Lake Turkana with new proxy records of SSTs from the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea.

For this case study a 33 cm long interval of exceptionally well-preserved sub-millimetre scale calcite varves of the interglacial lake deposits from Pi...nico has been selected. In addition to the demonstration of the very good repeatability of XRF element scans, one focus of this paper is on discussing a suitable scanner resolution in terms of a compromise between short analyses times and a resolution that allows capturing the geochemical signature even of seasonal sub-layers. By combining scanner data with microscopic sediment inspection geochemical signatures of various micro-facies as, for example, varves, detrital layers and matrix-supported and clay layers are explored. The potential of counting varves using the seasonal signature of specific elements is discussed and potential error sources are disclosed by comparison with microscopic varve counts. Detailed grid-mu XRF-scanning provides for the first time an insight into the internal structure of varves presented as high-resolution 3D-images. Finally, an approach of calibrating scanner data through comparison with ICP-MS analyses is introduced. Sensitivity factors for each element have been defined as ratios between mean count rates and bulk element concentrations.																			1571-5299		978-94-017-9849-5; 978-94-017-9848-8				2015	17						325	349		10.1007/978-94-017-9849-5_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9849-5_12	10.1007/978-94-017-9849-5												WOS:000404898700013

To assess invasive and native plant frequency and abundance over multiple seasons following management, we collected plant frequency, herbicide concentration, biomass, and hydroacoustic data. Two enclosed bays, St. Albans (64 ha) and Grays (64 ha), were treated at 300 mu g/L. St. Albans was treated in late May 2011 and 2013 and Grays was treated in late May 2012. Triclopyr half-lives ranged from 8.6 to 12.1 days. A larger, more open bay, Gideons (133 ha), was treated by targeting 50 ha of EWM beds at 1500 mu g/L in early June 2011. Triclopyr half-lives in Gideons treatment blocks averaged 3.7 days with a bay-wide half-life of 9.4 days. Near complete loss of EWM in the 3 bays was observed the year of treatment. Increased EWM frequency was observed the following June and August; however, EWM remained a minor component of bay-wide biomass (<2%). Number of points with native plants, mean native species per point, and native species richness in the bays were not reduced following treatment. Native species decreasing in frequency included Myriophyllum sibiricum, Zosterella dubia, Elodea canadensis, and Potamogeton zosteriformis. Most native plants showed no significant posttreatment change in frequency. Hydroacoustic data did not indicate bay-wide decreases in percent coverage or biovolume. Treatments provided up to 2 seasons of EWM control without reducing the overall distribution and abundance of native plants.

The benthic assemblage was sampled seasonally at six sites during a period of 2 years (June 2008-March 2010). Additionally, hypolimnetic water quality variables were monitored over the same period at each site. The benthic fauna of Lake Golcuk was found to be very limited with 16 species belonging to four taxonomic groups. Potamothrix hammoniensis was the dominant benthic species and represented more than 72% of the total benthic fauna. Depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, transparency, and water temperature seemed to be the main environmental factors affecting community indices. Benthic communities are affected by human disturbances in Lake Golcuk shifting their composition to more tolerant taxa, reflecting also the eutrophic to hypertophic character of the lake.

A Comparison of Three Anatomical Structures for Estimating Age in a Slow-Growing Subarctic Population of Lake Whitefish	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												It has been well documented in previous research that otoliths are the preferred hard structure for estimating age in coregonids. However, the slower growth due to short growing seasons experienced by populations in the subarctic region of the boreal zone may alter the utility of alternative nonlethal structures for estimating age. We compared the three most commonly used age estimation structures (otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales) for Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in a northern (above 50 degrees N) population from Great Slave Lake. This study provides new perspectives regarding the use of different aging structures with fish populations typical of subarctic and arctic environments. Results of ANOVA showed that reader confidence, within-reader precision, and the age estimates themselves were all affected by age structure; reader confidence also varied with age-class. Reader confidence was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by pectoral fin rays and then scales. Similarly, within-reader precision (as measured by CVs) was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by scales and then pectoral fin ray sections. Pairwise comparisons between age estimates from otoliths and those from scales or pectoral fin rays indicated no significant differences when fish were younger than 10 years (scales) or 12 years (fin rays), suggesting that these nonlethal structures could be conservatively used to reliably estimate ages of younger (<10 years) and smaller (<= 300 mm FL) Lake Whitefish. Of particular significance are the findings that (1) divergence between scale and otolith age estimates is delayed by 5-6 years relative to more southerly populations; and (2) in contrast to examples from southern populations, fin rays do not offer a suitable nonlethal alternative for estimating ages of older Lake Whitefish (>11 years).

The EPT index (abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera larvae), as well as their proportion to Chironomidae indicated that groups sensitive to environmental conditions occurred at low abundance in relation to the different hydrological types of oxbow lakes. The Family Biotic Index, the Biological Monitoring Working Part index adapted to Polish conditions and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) revealed low water quality regardless of the level of hydrological connectivity. In turn, the indices of biodiversity Margalef (d) and probability of interspecific encounters indicated good or satisfactory water quality. The pH correlated positively with the total abundance of aquatic invertebrates, while lower macroinvertebrate abundance was observed in turbid waters of lentic oxbows with a high content of total dissolved solids. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that hydrological connectivity was the main factor responsible for the value of monitoring indices, followed by the physical and chemical parameters of the local environment. Among the indices used, it was ASPT-PL that grouped the studied oxbow lakes according to their hydrological types and seems to be the best index. This study shows that the structure of invertebrate communities inhabiting oxbow lakes reflects physico-chemical conditions of water and can be a valuable source of monitoring data, indispensable to the management and protection of these important aquatic ecosystems.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019; Strzelczak, Agnieszka/B-5671-2011	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; Strzelczak, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3024-2225; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286													0270-5060	2156-6941				APR 3	2014	29	2					225	242		10.1080/02705060.2013.876943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2013.876943													WOS:000334039500006

Eating the Invaders: The Prevalence of Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus) in the Diet of Double-crested Cormorants on the Niagara River	WATERBIRDS												The Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus) is a small benthic fish, native to the Eurasian Ponto-Caspian region, that has rapidly spread through the entire Laurentian Great Lakes system since its 1990 discovery in Lake St. Clair. Tolerant of high population densities, the exotic Round Goby competes aggressively with native fish for food and habitat, and has increasingly been exploited by endemic Great Lakes predators. A management program for the Upper Niagara River, initiated in 2004, has provided an opportunity to study the interactions between these invaders and the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), a native top predator. The gut contents of 1,119 cormorants nesting at two sites in the Upper Niagara River from 2004 to 2007 were examined, and the species composition of ingested prey (by number and weight) was quantified for the 600 stomachs that contained identifiable prey. Results of these analyses indicate that Round Goby can constitute up to 85% of the biomass in cormorant diet during periods of the breeding season, and that gobies are consumed by cormorants through all dates sampled (May through August). Lengths of Round Gobies recovered in the cormorant diet were skewed towards larger members of the goby population, suggesting non-random selection relative to the range of size possibilities, and displayed significant declines in length between and within seasons.

Wetland inundation modeling of Dongting Lake using two-dimensional hydrodynamic model on unstructured grids	18TH BIENNIAL ISEM CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGICAL MODELLING FOR GLOBAL CHANGE AND COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEM	Procedia Environmental Sciences				18th Biennial ISEM Conference on Ecological Modelling for Global Change and Coupled Human and Natural Systems	SEP 20-23, 2011	Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling	Beijing Normal Univ			To understand the inundation process (wetting and drying) in the bottomlands of Dongting Lake, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model based on shallow water equations has been developed to model complex flow regime controlled by both the Yangtze River and its own basins. The governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method with the combination of quadrilateral and triangular grids and the mass and momentum fluxes are solved using the approximate Riemann solver, HLLC scheme with high spatial resolution. The processes of wetting and drying are specially treated to simulate the flow routing over dry bed. Verification shows that the proposed method can accurately capture flow propagation over dry bed resulting from suddenly breach of the dam. This performance is preferred for inundation modeling. After theoretical test, we applied the model to simulate the inundation process in Dongting Lake. Setting the calibrated roughness parameters, we successfully simulated flow processes in the lake from 2006 to 2010. The water extent changes rapidly along with the stage fluctuation in the lake. In dry season, water is mainly limited in channels, large parts of bottomlands are exposed and water extent reaches the yearly minimum. The whole lake is inundated in the flood season and the maximum of water extent reaches. After the flood season, the bottomlands expose again along with the gradual decrease of water. Particular hydrological regimes cause the regular zonal distribution of vegetation in Dongting Lake Wetland. Hydrology in the middle Yangtze River Basin is undergoing great changes. This model can be applied to assess possible responses of lake wetland for the changing environment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

Temporal and spatial variations in hydro-climatic extremes in the Lake Victoria basin	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												A study was carried out to investigate variability in long term hydro-climatic extremes in the Lake Victoria basin, East Africa. The study aimed at determining whether the long term historical changes in frequency and magnitude of hydro-climatic extremes are statistically significant, to give more light on the differentiation of climate variability from climate change. Long term extremes for 22 rainfall and 10 river flow gauge stations were examined. The hydro-climatic extremes were aggregated at levels from daily, decadal, to monthly scales defined for two wet seasons in the area, the long rainy season extending from March to May (MAM) and the short rainy season extending from October to December (OND), and time slices of 10 years using a sliding window approach. An empirical statistical technique based on Quantile Perturbation Method (QPM) was used. Quantile perturbations that represent empirical changes for precipitation and river flow extremes were derived. Significant decreasing trends in precipitation were observed in the 1930s, 1970s and 1980s. while significant increasing trends were common in the 1960s, late 1980s, and 1990s to the most recent years (2000-2006). In general, significant trends were dominant in the OND compared to MAM season for precipitation and river flow extremes. Results indicated further that there are differences in geographic location of significant trends in the hydro-climatic variables investigated implying that impacts are not spatially coherent. Areas with significant trends appeared to be concentrated in the North to North eastern parts compared to those in the southern parts of the basin. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To know their seasonality, morphology and habitat use is relevant to understand their biology and to allow the conservation of this highly threatened ichthyofauna. Likewise, the early stages of fish's life cycle are highly labile and their success determines the persistence of the populations over time. For this reason the aims of this work is to report and describe the results of intensive samplings performed to find the early stages of the 14 native species that inhabit in the San Pedro River (Valdivia river Basin). Samplings were done during 465 days along the river, from October 2005 to March 2008. We found eggs, larvae and juveniles of Galaxias maculatus, Basilichthys australis and Percilia gillissi, larvae and juveniles of Geotria australis and Trichomycterus areolatus; and juveniles only of Diplomystes camposensis, Percichthys trucha and Cheirodon australe. We describe the season and habitat of occurrence, as well as their general morphological characteristics. This is the first description of embryonic and larval development stages for P gillissi. A spatial-temporal segregation of the spawning and larvae rearing is observed, mainly marked by the use of the floodplain as rearing sites. The temporal extention of this study at riparian scale suggests than efforts in search of early stages of knowless species would be focus in deeper and/or rushing environments.

However, the mechanism and pathways of cyanobacteria decline are less understood. To identify and define the growth and decline of Microcystis blooms in Taihu Lake of China, and to illuminate the destination of surface floating blooms, we investigated the biomass distribution and variations in colony size, morphology, and floating velocity from October 2008 to September 2009. The results showed that the Microcystis bloom declined in response to biomass decrease, colony disaggregation, buoyancy reduction, and increased phytoplankton biodiversity, and these indicative parameters could be applied for recognition of the development phases of the bloom. Three major decline pathways were proposed to describe the bloom decline process, colony disaggregation (Pathway I), colony settlement (Pathway II), and cell lysis in colonies (Pathway III). We proposed a strategy to define the occurrence and decline of Microcystis blooms, to evaluate the survival state under different stress conditions, and to indicate the efficiency of controlling countermeasures against algal blooms.

J	Carrasco, NK; Perissinotto, R				Carrasco, Nicola K.; Perissinotto, Renzo			The comparative diet of the dominant zooplankton species in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The copepods Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni, Acartia natalensis and the mysid Mesopodopsis africana are the three dominant zooplankton taxa in the St Lucia Estuary, Africa's largest estuarine lake. This system is currently undergoing severe desiccation, owing to freshwater deprivation. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of the main primary and secondary producers were analysed temporally in two contrasting habitats, Charters Creek, heavily affected by desiccation, and the Mouth, virtually under unchanged conditions. This study aimed to compare the diet composition of these species under different environmental conditions. The mixed model SIAR (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) v 4.0 was used to determine the contribution of each food item to the diet of these taxa. Copepods made a substantial contribution to the diet of M. africana in the Mouth region, while those at Charters Creek utilized an even mixture of the available sources. At the Mouth, P. stuhlmanni utilized mostly particulate organic matter (POM), while feeding on an even mixture of available sources at Charters Creek. Limited data were available for A. natalensis, due to its short seasonal occurrence. Results do, however, indicate that this species feeds primarily on POM at the Mouth. Overall, diet composition of all three species is more selective at the Mouth. This can be attributed either to the harsh environmental conditions prevailing at Charters Creek or to the poor separation of delta C-13 signatures of primary producers in this region. The food partitioning abilities shown by these species may facilitate the utilization of resources available in the estuary.

J	Fathi, AA; Flower, RJ				Fathi, AA; Flower, RJ			Water quality and phytoplankton communities in Lake Qarun (Egypt)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Qarun is a closed saline lake in the northern part of El-Fayoum Depression (Middle Egypt) at the margin of the Great Western Desert. It is almost entirely sustained by inflow from the Nile River and, during the 20th century, lake water salinity has increased strongly. Physico-chemical characteristics and phytoplankton periodicity in the lake were monitored during 2001. All the water quality variables measured showed considerable seasonal variation, and quantitative and qualitative differences in phytoplankton communities were recorded. The maximum crop density was in August, whereas lowest values occurred in December. Highest crop densities coincided with a high abundance of Bacillariophyceae. The Bacillariophyceae were most diverse with 23 species, then Chlorophyceae with 16, Cyanophyceae with 8, and Chrysphyceae and Dinophyceae with one species each. Despite being a saline inland lake, the open-water phytoplankton communities were composed of some marine/brackish forms but mainly of freshwater communities tolerant to high salinity. The identified phytoplankton species indicate a tendency towards eutrophy but total crop densities were relatively low compared with eutrophic lakes elsewhere. Light limitation by suspended solids as well as hydrological related factors are believed responsible for the relatively low phytoplankton abundance. The lake appears to be ecologically unstable and careful limnological monitoring is recommended.

Body Mass in Common Loons (Gavia immer) Strongly Associated with Migration Distance	WATERBIRDS												During 25 field seasons between 1988 and 2012, Biodiversity Research Institute captured and uniquely color-banded 2,730 adult Common Loons (Gavia immer) on breeding territories in 11 States and seven Provinces throughout North America. Body mass was obtained from each individual; tarsus and bill measurements were obtained from more than half the birds banded. Clinal variation in body mass, tarsal width and bill length was observed. Body mass varied from 2,700 g to 7,600 g; loons from populations in the upper Great Lakes and central Canada were smallest, and size increased to the east and west. Examination of band return and satellite tracking data resulted in three migration distance groups: < 1,500 km; 1,500-3,500 km; and >= 3,500 km. Body mass was inversely related to migration distance. Males were significantly larger (> 20%) than associated females, and within-pair differences increased with decreasing migration distance (i.e., males from coastal States were proportionally larger than their mates compared to interior State pairs).																			1524-4695	1938-5390				APR	2014	37				1		64	75		10.1675/063.037.sp109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.037.sp109													WOS:000335613500009

Hydrological manipulation to assist spawning of a threatened galaxiid fish in a highland lake system	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Hydrological alterations threaten freshwater fishes globally, with infrastructure-related modification of inland waterways (e.g. dams, water diversions) having profound impacts on many species. Adapting existing water-management systems can provide opportunities for undertaking hydrological manipulations to assist management of threatened fishes. The present study conducted two hydrological manipulations in an impounded highland lake system in Tasmania, Australia, under differing hydrological conditions in 2007 and 2009, to assist recovery of an endemic species, Galaxias auratus, following a prolonged drought. Monitoring at egg, larvae, juvenile and adult life stages revealed a positive response by G. auratus in Lake Crescent (recipient of water release), with no adverse impact on the species in Lake Sorell (source of water release). In both years, reproductive constraints imposed by water level-related availability of sediment-free rocky substrata delayed spawning (similar to 1 month) of G. auratus in Lake Crescent. Despite this, spawning and recruitment occurred in 2007 (drought year) and 2009 (drought-breaking year), and the 2007 manipulation resulted in a two-fold increase in the seasonal density of larvae in Lake Crescent and an abundant cohort of YOY fish. Given knowledge of life histories and eco-hydrological relationships, manipulating (or re-instating) hydrologic conditions is a powerful tool for assisting recovery of threatened lacustrine fishes.

Riparian buffers are now well recognized for their roles in the removal of inorganic nitrogen mainly via denitrification. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms of nitrate removal in the riparian buffers of Lake Dianchi. We investigated the wet and dry seasonal dynamics of denitrification rate (DNR) in the soil profiles along the topographic gradient in three riparian buffers with different vegetation types (i.e. forest, open forest, and grass). A strong vertical pattern was observed in soil organic C and N concentrations (i.e. total N, DON, NO3-N, and NH4-N) along the soil layers. We also found significantly higher in situ denitrification activity in the upper horizon along each topohydrosequence while the activities of soil denitrification could be detected down to deeper soil horizons (0.1 to 0.8 mg N per kg dry soil per day), which may contribute significantly to the reduction of the ground water nitrate. Meanwhile, the DNR in the zones near the lake was significantly higher than that in zones near the border with the upland terrace, and also in the wet seasons than in dry seasons. Denitrification rates in the forest, open forest and grass sites were significantly different only in wet seasons. Especially, we found soil organic C had a strong correlation with denitrification in all sites, despite the large intersite variability of soil and vegetation. Our data suggested spatial heterogeneity of substrate availability along a hydrologic and topographic gradient can be the primary control on spatial-seasonal patterns of denitrification in riparian buffers.																			2050-7887	2050-7895					2013	15	5					963	971		10.1039/c3em30808a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em30808a								23525252					WOS:000318309700008

Potential for the development of submerged macrophytes in eutrophicated shallow peaty lakes after restoration measures	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Biomanipulation of eutropicated peaty lakes has rarely been successful; clear water with dense macrophyte stands fails to develop in most cases. It was unclear whether (1) high turbidity due to resuspension by benthivorous fish or wind is the major cause of low macrophyte density or whether (2) the establishment of submerged macrophyte stands is prevented by a lack of propagules, low cohesive strength of the lake sediment, high concentrations of phytotoxics, grazing by waterfowl and/or shading by periphyton growth. These hypotheses were tested in an experiment in a shallow peat lake in the Netherlands (Terra Nova). Removal of fish from a 0.5 ha experimental site resulted in clear water and the development of a dense (90% coverage) and species-rich (10 species) submerged vegetation. At a fish-stocked site and a control site the water remained turbid and dense macrophyte stands did not develop. The establishment of submerged macrophytes appeared not to be limited by a lack of propagules. Introduced plants grew poorly in turbid water, but very well in clear water. Exclosures showed that bird grazing reduced the plant biomass. In clear water grazing seemed to enhance the vegetation diversity. Periphyton development did not prevent plant growth in clear water. After the experiment, the fish stock was greatly reduced in the whole lake (85 ha), to test if (3) in a large lake, submerged macrophyte stands will not develop after biomanipulation. In the first season after fish reduction, transparency increased and species-rich submerged macrophyte stands developed, covering 60% of the shallow parts of the lake. Most of the species known to have occurred in the past re-established. The results indicate that high turbidity caused by benthivorous fish in combination with bird grazing were the major causes of the absence of submerged macrophyte stands in this lake. Abiotic conditions after the clearing of the lake were suitable for the growth of macrophytes. We infer that the restoration potential of submerged macrophyte stands in eutrophicated peaty lakes can be high, and results can be obtained quickly.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	584						277	290		10.1007/s10750-007-0593-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0593-x													WOS:000246583500026

H.; de Moel, Hans; Renssen, Hans			Verification of a coupled climate-hydrological model against Holocene palaeohydrological records	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												We have coupled a climate model (ECBilt-CLIO-VECODE) and a hydrological model (STREAM) offline to simulate palaeodischarge of nineteen rivers (Amazon, Congo, Danube, Ganges, Krishna, Lena, Mackenzie, Mekong, Meuse, Mississippi, Murray-Darling, Nile, Oder, Rhine, Sacramento-San Joaquin, Syr Darya, Volga, Volta, Zambezi) for three time-slices: Early Holocene (9000-8650 BP), Mid-Holocene (6200-5850 BP) and Recent (1750-2000 AD). To evaluate the model's skill in retrodicting broad changes in mean palaeodischarge we have compared the model results with palaeodischarge estimates from multi-proxy records. We have compared the general trends inferred from the proxy data with statistical differences in modelled discharge between the three periods, thereby developing a technique to assess the level of agreement between the model and proxy data. The quality of the proxy data for each basin has been classed as good, reasonable or low. Of the model runs for which the proxy data were good or reasonable, 72% were in good agreement with the proxy data, and 92% were in at least reasonable agreement. We conclude that the coupled climate-hydrological model performs well in simulating mean discharge in the time-slices studied. The discharge trends inferred from the proxy and model data closely follow latitudinal and seasonal variations in insolation over the Holocene. For a number of basins for which agreement was not good we have identified specific mechanisms which could be responsible for the discrepancy, primarily the absence of the Laurentide ice sheet in our model. In order to use the model in an operational sense within water management studies it would be useful to use a higher spatial resolution and a daily time-step.

Geoheritage values of consanguineous wetland suites on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES					Australian Earth Science Convention	JUN, 2016	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA					A wide range of wetland types occur on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia. They vary from basins, and flats, to slopes and channels, and vary in size, shape, water characteristics, sediment types, stratigraphy, vegetation, origin, and maintenance processes. The wetlands range from large linear lakes to small round or irregular seasonally damp wetland basins to seasonally flooded flats, to seasonally flooded or permanently flowing channels. Salinity ranges from fresh to saline to hyposaline; and recharge mechanisms from perching of surface-water to wetting and inundation by groundwater, as determined by regional features such as geology, geomorphology, soils, climate and hydrology, and local physical/chemical processes. The Swan Coastal Plain presents a bewildering array, diversity, and complexity of wetlands, but patterns and ordering can be recognised if the wetlands are aggregated into natural groups. The wetlands, in fact, have been aggregated into natural groupings termed consanguineous suites', resulting in some 30 different formally named wetland suites related to geomorphic setting varying, for instance, from interdune depressions on a beach-ridge plain (the Becher Suite), to karst-formed linear lakes in limestone-ridge country (the Yanchep Suite), to irregular to round, semi-interconnected basins on a quartz sand subdued dune system (the Jandakot Suite), to linear and round basins formed along the hydrological contact between limestone and quartz sand (the Bibra Suite), among others. The variety of wetland types on the Swan Coastal Plain represents geodiversity that needs to be addressed in geoheritage assessments of the State of Western Australia. Further, as repositories of Holocene to Pleistocene sedimentary sequences, the wetlands present significant reservoirs of information on wetland history, climate changes, and hydrochemical history, and are templates on wetland maintenance and functioning, diagnostic for their geologic/geomorphic setting useful for management of wetlands in Western Australia, nationally, and globally. From a global perspective, the diversity and array of consanguineous suites of the Swan Coastal Plain is unique. An understated aspect of the approach in identifying consanguineous suites of wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain is that in their geological, geomorphological, and hydrological/hydrochemical setting they provide profound insights into gradual and uninterrupted wetland development, sedimentary filling and ecological functioning because, for a given east-west transect, they are located in the same climate setting but in different geologic/geomorphic and hydrochemical settings. They appear to be unrepresented globally, and therefore, in terms of geoheritage, are internationally significant.																			0812-0099	1440-0952				AUG 18	2019	66	6					837	853		10.1080/08120099.2019.1566177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2019.1566177													WOS:000474602700009

Sixteen zooplankton species belonging to three main groups were identified at the "bordo": 11 rotifers, 3 cladocerans, and 2 copepods. The most frequent species was the copepod Arctodiaptomus dorsalis, occurring in 100% of the samples, with a density of 1182 org/L. Among the cladocerans, Diaphanosoma birgei was the most frequent and abundant (100% and 85 org/L, respectively). The most abundant rotifer species was Brachionus falcatus (1511 org/L) and the most frequent was B. caudatus (92%). The family Brachionidae had the highest species richness in the surveyed system. The highest zooplankton abundances and species richness were recorded during the dry season. Huitchila microreservoir is a eutrophic system, with warm water (20.3-28 degrees C), high availability of dissolved oxygen (4.1-16.2 mg/L), slightly alkaline, hard waters, with low conductivity (693-1258 mu S/cm). This aquatic system is productive and has high food availability for the tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, a local fisheries resource.

Using the TOPEX/Poseidon GDR-M dataset from January 1993 to December 2004, we study the spatial and temporal distribution of sigma at bands Ku and C over Xinjiang, western China. The results show that the sigma0 is influenced by the water distribution over land and the time evolution of sigma0 has clear seasonal changes. River basins or deserts are classified over the spatial distribution based on different sigma0 values. For example, high sigma0 values are found in the Tarim River Basin and low values are found in the Taldimakan Desert. The periodic components of sigma0 time series are determined using the fast Fourier transformation method. The annual variation is the dominating cycle and the semi-annual variation is the secondary signal. The amplitudes of sigma0 time series at bands Ku and C are also given and most areas have quite low amplitudes except for the Tarim River Basin. Several areas including the Tarim River Basin, Tianshan Mountain and Taldimakan Desert are selected for sigma0 time series spacial analysis to discuss the reasons for variations in sigma0. The main factors are precipitation and vegetation growth, which are affected by the global/regional climate change. The correlation between the brightness temperature, which is related to the water-vapor content in the atmosphere measured by TMR at the 21 GHz channel and sigma0 at two bands, is analyzed.						guo, jinyun/0000-0003-1817-1505													1017-0839					AUG	2013	24	4	1		SI		565	579		10.3319/TAO.2012.11.01.01(TibXS)	http://dx.doi.org/10.3319/TAO.2012.11.01.01(TibXS)													WOS:000329894700010

This situation highlights the urgent need to develop measures for the conservation and recovery of the species based on a deep understanding of its specific habitat requirements. In this study, spatial distribution and habitat selection patterns were investigated to determine the limiting factors for the species at different times of the year and at different spatial scales, from macro to microhabitats. The presence of the freshwater blenny was assessed at 127 sites in the Ebro River basin, Spain, between 2002 and 2012. It was only detected at 25 sites, corresponding to the intermediate and lower reaches of medium-sized tributaries and in the main river, in accordance with the ecology of the species. Whether the species was present depended on the physicochemical, habitat and biological conditions of the study sites. Freshwater blenny was very sensitive to organic pollution and eutrophication, the deterioration of substrate composition and channel structure, and the degradation of aquatic and riparian vegetation. Freshwater blenny showed a selective use of microhabitat locations with high current velocity, linked to gravel or cobble substrate. It was also observed that the species is capable of adapting its selection behaviour to the flow-mediated seasonal changes in its physical environment. Although the results presented indicate that the species is not a microhabitat specialist, individual survival is likely to be dependent on the availability of key microhabitats, which must be protected against detrimental human activity.					; Almodóvar, Ana/L-5400-2014; G.

In this paper, the Sobol's sensitivity analysis method was applied to a quantitative analysis of the important factors governing a water quality model, which has been developed to simulate algal dynamics in Caotang Bay, one of the tributary bays in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The analysis focused on the response of chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen to 11 parameters. The results show that chlorophyll-a is influenced mainly by the maximum phytoplankton growth rate, the lower optimum temperature for algal growth, the phosphate half-saturation constant, and the phytoplankton linear mortality rate; while dissolved oxygen is influenced mainly by the maximum phytoplankton growth rate, the lower optimum temperature for algal growth, the phytoplankton basal respiration rate, and the detritus remineralization rate. These parameter sensitivities change with time and have a marked seasonal pattern. The parameter sensitivity differences between a shallow lake or reservoir and a deep reservoir suggest that mechanisms of cycling in nutrients and dissolved oxygen are different.					; Ji, Fei/JSK-3829-2023	Cheng, Yao/0000-0001-5739-7924; Ji, Fei/0000-0002-6890-4933; Wang, Yuchun/0000-0002-7243-353X													2073-4441					FEB	2018	10	2							153	10.3390/w10020153	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020153													WOS:000426775500063

Diel timing of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) activity revealed by satellite tags in the Laurentian Great Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are slow-growing and long-lived residents of the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, making them vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. The behavior of lake sturgeon, and how it may result in conflict with human activities, remain incompletely understood. Our goal was to describe how environmental conditions, such as depth, temperature, and time of day, influence lake sturgeon activity. Data were recorded using pop-up archival satellite tags, which have provided insight into the ecology, physiology, and behavior of challenging to study marine megafauna, yet are rarely deployed within freshwater ecosystems despite parallel research needs. Adult lake sturgeon were fitted with satellite tags containing integrated accelerometers near spawning grounds in the Niagara River between Canada and the United States. We used the time-series of acceleration in recovered tags to test the hypothesis that lake sturgeon exhibit diel activity cycles in situ. We defined activity as acceleration greater than two standard deviations from a running average. We applied this classification to partial records obtained from satellite transmission, an approach that can render incomplete datasets a useable product for analysis. Lake sturgeon were most active nocturnally with a significant mean at 22:32 h. Generalized linear mixed-effect models showed temperature and time of day to be significant predictors of activity. Temporal cycles of fish activity should be understood and could be exploited to reduce human-fish conflict in the increasingly altered waterways of the globe.

As a surrogate of productivity, the number of cells/ml and the total biovolume[mu m(3)]/ml, both spanning over more than six orders of magnitude (from 10(1) to 10(7) for the number of cells and from 10(2) to 10(9) for the biovolume) were used. The phytoplankton was characterized by its species composition and also by the composition of large taxonomic groups. The data were analysed by constrained ordination (Canonical Correspondence Analysis), including variation partitioning, and by ANOVA of the estimates of species optima based on weighted averages of environmental characteristics. All the explanatory variable groups, i.e. productivity, geography/climate, and season have significant effects on both the species composition and the composition of large taxonomic groups. Productivity is the best predictor of both species and large taxonomic group composition, followed by climatic variables and finally season. The relative effectiveness of productivity as a predictor was considerably greater for large taxonomic groups. The productivity characterized by the number of cells was always a better predictor than when characterized by biovolume. The species optima estimated as weighted averages of corresponding environmental variables show consistent patterns according to large taxonomic groups, but also according to the genera within the groups: in particular, the cyanobacteria and Chrysophyceae preferred on average the most and the least productive environments respectively, however, there were large differences in species preferences also within groups and even within genera. The optima of species on the trophic gradient are suitable characteristics for ecological indication and are presented for more than 400 taxa in the appendix together with estimates of species tolerance.

J	Hutalle-Schmelzer, KML; Grossart, HP				Hutalle-Schmelzer, Kristine Michelle L.; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Changes in the bacterioplankton community of oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (northeastern Germany) after humic matter addition	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In an effort to better understand the dynamics of members of the bacterioplankton community in relation to humic matter (HM) addition, and to provide insight into the ecology of common and persistent as well as transient freshwater bacteria, we designed a study with a batch and a dilution approach. We used single vs. repeated HM additions in incubations with bacterial communities from the epilimnion (0-10 m) and hypolimnion (40 m) of oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (northeastern Germany). Molecular methods were applied for detailed phylogenetic characterization of bacterial community composition (BCC) every 2 wk over 8 wk of incubation at in situ temperature. Whereas no significant differences in the development of BCC in batch vs. dilution cultures were observed, the BCC of epilimnic and hypolimnic samples greatly differed. This indicates that HM addition led to the establishment of a highly specific but different BCC depending on the source community in combination with the respective in situ temperature. Further, DGGE banding patterns revealed a high variability in the BCC of epilimnic and hypolimnic samples. Betaproteobacteria were consistently present and specific Alphaproteobacteria, such as members of the Roseisalinus group, Bacteroidetes, and Deltaproteobacteria were enriched only after HM addition. Other phylogenetic groups, including Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, were only sporadically present. Our approach resulted in the cultivation of a variety of bacteria such as Lysobacter, Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhodopila, and Variovorax species. The addition of HM selected for specific HM-degrading bacterial phylotypes, which are found at different depths even in the clear waters of Lake Stechlin.

The hydrodynamics of the lake followed a warm-monomictic pattern with mixing at a minimum temperature during the early dry season while the stratification was pronounced in the late dry season and throughout the rainy season; anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion lasted <9 months. The annual mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a were below 4 mu g L-1 in 1998, 1999 and 2001, however, 6.1 and 5.2 mu g L-1 in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Total picoplankton, TPP, displayed a temporal pattern that followed the mixing-stratification cycle. The highest TPP values (the whole water column >= 5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)) were found during mixing and early stratification (January-March). The minimum numbers were present during late stratification (October-November). The maximum TPP numbers were observed within the layer 0-20 m, which corresponded to the epilimnion during the stratification period. Neither the thermocline nor the deep chlorophyll maximum showed an elevated TPP concentration. In the hypolimnion, TPP numbers were low (frequently <1 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)) apparently as a result of the long period of anoxia. Nothwithstanding autotrophic picoplankton (APP) contributed even >= 30% of TPP (2001 to 2002); no significant correlation was found between TPP and chlorophyll-a.

Controlling Factors of Phytoplankton Productivity in Marshes in a Hot Climate with High Seasonal Variation	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												In this work the Auda marsh, which is part of a system of Iraqi marshes, was sampled to assess the seasonal dynamics and controlling factors of microalgae productivity. The marshes are situated in a hot climate with high seasonal variation near the Arabian Gulf. Physicochemical and biological measurements were taken for water in three areas. Bio-optical models were constructed to describe the primary productivity and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the wet and dry seasons separately and also for the entire area of the Iraqi marshes. The models, as well as almost all measurements, showed high seasonal variation. The mean water temperature was 16 degrees C in the wet season and 28 degrees C in the dry season. An almost twofold difference was measured for turbidity and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a for the two seasons. Chlorophyll-a appeared to be a better indicator of ecosystem conditions than primary productivity or biological oxygen demand, according to the results obtained from canonical correlation analysis. Nitrogen or phosphorous did not explain primary productivity or chlorophyll-a to an appreciable extent. Biological variables were related most strongly to water temperature and turbidity, which were the factors most important for controlling phytoplankton productivity in the marshes.

Parameters related to growth. fecundity and survival were estimated for post-recruitment (age > 1 growing season) life stages of Lake Southern Konnevesi vendace in both very high and low population abundance regimes. Pre-recruitment survival producing population stability was then determined. We found a very strong compensatory density dependence in growth, fecundity and survival: during low abundance, a lifetime reproductive output of a female was almost 20 times that of the abundant regime. To maintain the low abundance regime, pre-recruitment survival must counterbalance it by decreasing to a very low level. Potential drivers of high variability in pre-recruit survival and potential for depensation, Allee effect, are discussed, as well as the implications of the results on fisheries management and risk of extinction due to anthropogenic stressors such as global warming or extensive predator stocking.

Nutrient Budgets Calculated in Floodwaters Using a Whole-Ecosystem Reservoir Creation and Flooding Experiment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Flooding in forested areas can release nutrients via organic matter flushing and organic matter decomposition and contribute to nutrient loading in aquatic ecosystems. Organic matter content may set an upper limit for nutrient release during flooding, but variation in timing, depth, duration of inundation, and site organic matter substrate inhibit comparison across sites and events. We used data collected during a whole-ecosystem flooding experiment conducted at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario to examine the relationship between site organic matter content and nutrient release on both a short-term (first 3 weeks) and annual scale (open-water season). Three upland forest sites with differing amounts of organic matter stored in soil and vegetation were flooded to create experimental reservoirs. We hypothesized that the magnitude of nutrient release would be related to the organic matter content in each site. We found that nutrient concentrations increased relative to low-nutrient water pumped into each reservoir at both scales, but there was no relationship between site organic matter content and short-term total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations or annual TN and TP fluxes. Additionally, N and P release rates differed, decreasing TN:TP ratios in reservoirs and outflows relative to inflows. Nutrient concentrations increased immediately after inundation each year and continued for 5 years of repeated flooding. Predicted increases in flooding due to changing precipitation patterns and reservoir creation may cause forested areas to be a long-term nutrient source to aquatic ecosystems. Over time, nutrient accumulation may affect water quality, shift biological communities, and influence ecosystem functioning.

Sustained-Flux Global Warming Potential Driven by Nitrogen Inflow and Hydroperiod in a Model of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Wetlands impact global warming by regulating the atmospheric exchange of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated GHG emissions in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands across various hydrologic, temperature, and nitrogen (N) inflow regimes using a process-based simulation model. We found the emission of CH4, N2O, and sequestration of C (i.e., negative net ecosystem exchange, NEE) in our simulations were all positively related to water residence time and N inflow, primarily due to greater plant productivity and N uptake, which facilitated greater C and N cycling rates in the model. Water level scenarios also had an effect on GHG exchanges by moderating the transitions between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Temperature effects on GHGs were minimal compared with other factors. The net sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP; i.e., sum SGWP of CH4, N2O, and NEE) of wetlands on 20-year and 100-year time horizons were both primarily driven by CH4 emissions and strongly controlled by the tradeoffs between CH4 emission and CO2 sequestration, with a negligible amount of simulated N2O emissions. Future research could include model enhancements to provide increased process-level details on the aerobic-anaerobic transitions or the direct effects of plants on mediating GHG exchanges. Field studies addressing the interaction of N inflows and water residence time at appropriately large scales are needed to test the complex interactions revealed by our modeling study. Our results highlight the previously under-appreciated role of nitrogen and water residence time in modulating SGWP in coastal wetlands.					; Kritchevsky, Stephen/JWP-7971-2024	Currie, William/0000-0003-1975-0808; Martina, Jason/0000-0002-3912-4911; Yuan, Ye/0000-0003-1330-4049; Sharp, Sean/0000-0002-6724-0186													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2021	126	8							e2021JG006242	10.1029/2021JG006242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006242													WOS:000688734500018
J	Hecky, RE; Bootsma, HA; Kingdon, ML				Hecky, RE; Bootsma, HA; Kingdon, ML			Impact of land use on sediment and nutrient yields to Lake Malawi/Nyasa (Africa)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Thirteen rivers flowing into Lake Malawi/Nyasa from the country of Malawi in southern Africa were studied over 1 year to estimate annual yields of sediments and nutrients from the terrestrial catchments to the take. The river basins ranged in size from 113 to 12,110 km(2), but maximum elevations above lake level were similar in all the catchments yielding quite different mean basin slopes. Flow was seasonally variable with low or no flow at the end of the prolonged dry season. Annual runoff varied from 37 to 617 mm with most rivers having below average discharges in 1997. The river basins were all affected to varying degrees by subsistence farming which is the dominant land use in Malawi. Sediment and nutrient (C, N, P, Si) concentrations, loads, and yields were sensitive to the degree of agricultural land use in the basins. Lowest sediment concentrations, loads, and yields were characteristic of the small, steep catchments with a high proportion of intact forest. Highest concentrations, loads, and yields of sediments were from densely settled catchments with extensive agricultural activity. Concentrations, loads, and yields of nutrients tended to follow the particulate fluxes as dissolved components were less responsive to basin disturbance. Increasing populations and associated agricultural development may already have increased nutrient loading to Lake Malawi by 50% as forests have been increasingly cleared for agriculture.																			0380-1330						2003	29			2			139	158		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70544-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70544-9													WOS:000221126800011

Variations in local components, including pollen, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs, and related changes in sedimentation document the lake development from initially seepage and shallow basin to deeper lake during the mid Holocene and then to the hydrologically open system during the late Holocene. The studies of volcanic ashes from the lake sediment core show their complex depositional histories. Lake Sokoch occupies a former proglacial basin between two terminal moraines of the LGM time. The undated basal part of record before ca. 9600 year BP, however, does not reflect properly cold conditions. At that time, although shrublands and tundra dominated, stone birch and white birch forests have already settled in surroundings; the presence of alder woodland indicates wet and maritime-like climate. The subsequent forest advance suggesting warmer conditions was interrupted by the ca. 8000-7600 year BP spell of cooler climate. The following culmination of warmth is bracketed by the evidence of the first maximal forest extent between ca. 7400 and 5100 year BP. During that time, dramatic retreat of alder forest suggests a turn from maritime-like to more continental climate conditions. The cool and wet pulse after ca. 5100 year BP was pronounced as forests retreat while shrublands, meadows and bogs extended. An expansion of white birch forest since ca. 3500 year BP reflected the onset of drier climate, strengthening continentality and seasonal contrast. The second maximum of forests dominated by both stone and white birches occurred between ca. 2200 and 1700 year BP and indicated warming in association with relatively dry and increasingly continental climate. The following period was wetter and cooler, and minor outbreak of alder forest around ca. 1500 year BP suggests a short-term return of maritimelike conditions. Since ca. 1300 year BP forests retreated and replaced by shrublands, tundra and bogs, pointing to cool and wet climate and likely increased back continentality. A prominent re-advance of stone birch forest shown atop the record, most probably reflects recent warming trend. The reconstructed cool periods correlate well with Holocene glacial advances in neighboring mountain areas and with the tree ring and ice core records from the Central Kamchatka Depression. The Lake Sokoch pollen record, being consistent with the previously obtained regional paleoclimatic data, yet contributes new detailed information, especially for the late Holocene.

The role of vegetated areas on fish assemblage of the Parana River floodplain: effects of different hydrological conditions	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												In this paper, we analyze the changes in composition and abundance of fish assemblages in seven vegetated floodplain wetlands with different connectivity across different hydrologic conditions: after a prolonged connection of the floodplain with the main channel, during receding water, and after a prolonged isolation. We also investigated the size and abundance of large-sized migratory species found in these wetlands and the food resources exploited by the dominant fish. Fishes were captured by diurnal seining (8.0 m x 1.50 m, 5 mm mesh) along macrophyte banks. Despite the high total number of species registered (100), sample species richness varied between 7 and 31, depending on the sampling site and the sampling date. Cluster analysis indicated low similarity between sites during both the isolation and the prolonged connection. Species turnover decreased from high water (beta = 40.33) to low water (beta = 33.83), with the minimum value of beta diversity index obtained during the isolation of the floodplain wetlands (beta = 26.83). Our results indicated that different dominant populations of fish occur in different hydrological conditions, even though high water and isolation phases occur in the same season of different years. The ordination (NMDS) indicated the importance of hydrologic conditions in structuring fish assemblages in the studied floodplain. Small-sized characids, typically associated with macrophytes, dominated the fish assemblages, whereas the younger stages of large sized migratory species were found in low abundance. The maximum standard length of the fish captured was 28 cm and for large migratory fish, standard length varied between 1.6 and 25.0 cm. The dominant fish used several food resources, but littoral macrophytes-associated organisms had a high frequency of occurrence in the three hydrologic conditions. The high species richness of fish in the small, vegetated lakes was related to the high spatial heterogeneity during different hydrological conditions. Disturbances in the hydrological pulses could reduce the biodiversity by modifying the connectivity of the floodplain with the river channel. Conservation of these vegetated wetlands requires maintenance of actual width range of connectivity that provide diverse habitat along the time.																			1679-6225					MAR 31	2009	7	1					39	48		10.1590/S1679-62252009000100006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252009000100006													WOS:000265286200006
J	Birkett, CM				Birkett, CM			Synergistic remote sensing of Lake Chad: Variability of basin inundation	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During recent decades, drought and anthropogenic influences have led to the diminishment of Lake Chad with adverse effects on both food and water resources. The local population has learned to adapt to the reduced seasonal inundation of the lake basin but are vulnerable to both droughts and excessive inflows. Here synergistic satellite radar altimetry and near-infrared imagery are employed to gain knowledge of the current flooding patterns. Variations in surface level for the inflowing rivers and the permanent and seasonal lake waters are derived for the 1990s using data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer images provide additional variations of basin inundation from 1995 to 1998, using a simple pixel histogram technique. With accuracy greater than or equal to 10cm rms, the altimetry reveals seasonal water-level variations of the order 0.5-6 m and there is a notable rise in minimum levels, 15-35 cm year(-1) within the lake basin. Peak-level phase lags of 4 to 5 months are also observed between the headwaters of the Chari/Logone rivers and the western lake marshes. Image results reveal that the permanent lake area is similar to 1.385 km(2), and that with an accuracy of similar to 5% the surrounding regions have been additionally flooding by up to similar to 3,600 km(2) year (-1). Despite current basin complexities, the synergistic area/level measurements corroborate the know hydraulic relationship at low water levels. Both measurement sets reflect the poor inundation years of 1993/1994 and 1997/1998, despite the indication of a general recovery in regional precipitation, inundation extent, and surface water level offers these remote sensing techniques as an additional tool for flood/drought forecasting and the availability of future fast delivery data, a mechanism for near-real time monitoring.

In addition, it is also a solid reservoir of freshwater resources. Along with climate change, clarifying the dynamic changes of glacier in the Aksu River Basin (ARB) are important for hydrological processes. The study examined the variations in glacier area, elevation, and their reaction to climate change in the ARB between 1990 and 2022. The glacier melt on the runoff is explored from 2003 to 2020. This investigation utilized Landsat and Sentinal-2 images, ICESat, CryoSat, meteorological and hydrological data. The findings suggest that: (1) The glacier area in the ARB retreated by 309.40 km2 (9.37%, 0.29%<middle dot>a-1) from 1990 to 2022. From 2003 to 2021, the ARB glacier surface elevation retreat rate of 0.38 +/- 0.12 m<middle dot>a-1 (0.32 +/- 0.10 m w.e.a-1). Comparison with 2003-2009, the retreat rate is faster from 2010 to 2021. (2) From 1990 to 2022, the Toxkan and the Kumalak River Basin's glacier area decreases between 61.28 km2 (0.28%<middle dot>a-1) and 248.13 km2 (0.30%<middle dot>a-1). Additionally, the rate of glacier surface elevation declined by -0.34 +/- 0.11 m<middle dot>a-1, -0.42 +/- 0.14 m<middle dot>a-1 from 2003 to 2021. (3) The mass balance sensitivities to cold season precipitation and ablation-phase accumulated temperatures are +0.27 +/- 0.08 m w.e.a-1(10%)-1 and -0.33 +/- 0.10 m w.e.a-1 degrees C-1, respectively. The mass loss is (962.55 +/- 0.57) x 106 m3 w.e.a-1, (1087.50 +/- 0.68) x 106 m3 w.e.a-1 during 2003-2009, 2010-2021 respectively. Warmer ablation-phase accumulated temperatures dominate glacier retreat in the ARB. (4) Glacier meltwater accounted for 34.57% and 41.56% of the Aksu River's runoff during the ablation-phase of 2003-2009 and 2010-2020, respectively. The research has important implications for maintaining the stability of water resource systems based on glacier meltwater.

However, the reliability of the commonly used chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) to characterize phytoplankton density in lake environments needs to be further investigated. In this paper, we sampled and analyzed 365 samples from nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province during the dry and rainy seasons. The Chl-a data measured by the laboratory spectrophotometric method and the portable YSI multi-parameter water quality meter (YSI) directly used in the field were compared, and regression analysis and correlation analysis with phytoplankton density were performed. Most of the Chl-a values measured by the laboratory instrument were greater than those measured by the YSI, and the correlation between the two methods was weak (0.492, p < 0.001). The correlation between Chl-a and phytoplankton density measured by the YSI reached 0.67 (p < 0.001) in the dry season, while the laboratory methods used to measure Chl-a to characterize phytoplankton density may have led to an overestimation of phytoplankton density due to nonspecific sources of Chl-a. However, both methods are relatively inaccurate for characterizing phytoplankton density. For different trophic states of lakes, nutrient concentration changes affect the Chl-a concentration of phytoplankton. During different seasons, changes in the fluorescence intensity of phytoplankton in response to environmental conditions prevent the YSI results from reflecting the authentic phytoplankton density. Furthermore, high species diversity can lead to inconsistent changes in Chl-a and phytoplankton because the content of Chl-a in individual cells of different phytoplankton is different. The relationship between Chl-a and phytoplankton density was species specific. Therefore, when applying Chl-a to characterize phytoplankton density in lakes, it is necessary to consider environmental conditions, phytoplankton community structure and other practical conditions. In addition, laboratory analytical methods and instrumental techniques and instruments need to be improved.

Occupancy dynamics of free ranging American mink (Neogale vison) in Greece	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Identifying the environmental factors that determine the occurrence of invasive species is essential in defining and implementing effective control campaigns. Here, we applied multi-season occupancy models to analyze American mink (Neogale vison) track data collected using 121 floating rafts, as a function of factors occurring at multiple spatial scales. Our overall aim was to identify those factors that determine the use, colonization or abandonment of rafts by free ranging individuals found in western Macedonia, Greece. We found that increasing values of shrubs and rock cover at the micro-habitat scale were positively associated with the species' probability of raft use, as was the density of medium-sized rivers at the landscape scale. Colonization was found to increase with increasing amounts of shrub and reed cover; however, both variables were not informative. Conversely, the distance from the nearest fur farm was highly informative in predicting raft abandonment by the species. Effective control actions may require removal by trapping along rocky or densely vegetated riverbanks or lake shores located in the vicinity of the established fur farms in the area. Habitat management, although possible, may be difficult to implement due to the ability of the species to adapt. Finally, fur farms should maximize security and establish an early warning and rapid eradication system in case of future escapes.

Hypoxia tolerance of two centrarchid sunfishes and an introduced cichlid from karstic Everglades wetlands of southern Florida, USA	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In this study, the hypoxia tolerance of three Everglades fishes, two native centrarchids (Lepomis gulosus and Lepomis marginatus) and a recently introduced cichlid (Hemichromis letourneuxi), were documented. Aquatic surface respiration (ASR) thresholds were lowest for H. letourneuxi, followed by L. gulosus, then L. marginatus. The ASR thresholds for L. marginatus were within ranges reported for small, freshwater tropical fishes, while those for L. gulosus were similar to swamp-adapted fishes. For H. letourneuxi, ASR thresholds were some of the lowest reported. All three species showed excellent tolerance of low dissolved oxygen levels when allowed access to the surface. When denied surface access, L. marginatus lost equilibrium at a higher oxygen tension than the other species. Overall, although all species easily tolerated hypoxia, H. letourneuxi appeared to be best equipped to deal with hypoxia, followed by L. gulosus, then L. marginatus. Hemichromis letourneuxi also exhibited more aggressive behaviours than the centrarchids. These results suggest that hypoxia is not likely to prevent H. letourneuxi from exploiting the seasonally inundated wetlands of south Florida while expanding its range there.

Base cations in biomass, forest floor, and mineral soil (0-15 cm and 15-40 cm) pools were estimated for five replicated trees of each species; measured fluxes included bulk precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, litterfall, forest-floor leachate, mineralization + weathering, shallow-soil leachate, and deep-soil leachate. The three species differed in where base cations had accumulated within the single-tree ecosystems. Within these three single-tree ecosystems, the greatest quantity of base cations in woody biomass was found in sugar maple, whereas hemlock and basswood displayed the greatest amount in the upper 40 cm of mineral soil. Base-cation pools were ranked: sugar maple > basswood, hemlock in woody biomass; sugar maple, basswood > hemlock in foliage; hemlock > sugar maple, basswood in the forest floor, and basswood > sugar maple, hemlock in the mineral soil. Base-cation fluxes in throughfall, stemflow, the forest-floor leachate, and the deep-soil leachate (2000 only) were ranked: basswood > sugar maple > hemlock. Our measurements suggest that species-related differences in nutrient cycling are sufficient to produce significant differences in base-cation contents of the soil over short time intervals (< 65 years). Moreover, these species-mediated differences may be important controls over the spatial pattern and edaphic processes of northern hardwood-hemlock ecosystems in the upper Great Lakes region.

In tropical floodplain areas, however, floating meadows and flooded forests extend over large areas and can be important Hg methylating sites. We present here a cross-system comparison of the Hg net methylation capacity in surface sediments, flooded soils and roots of floating aquatic macrophytes, assayed by in situ incubation with Hg-203 and extraction of formed (MeHg)-Hg-203 by acid leaching and toluene. The presence of mono-MeHg was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and other techniques. Study areas included floodplain lakes in the Amazon basin (Tapajos: Negro and Amazon rivers), the Pantanal floodplain (Paraguay river basin), freshwater coastal lagoons in Rio de Janeiro and oxbow lakes in the Mogi-Guacu river, Sao Paulo state. Different Hg levels were added in assays performed in 1994-1998, but great care was taken to standardise all other test parameters, to allow data comparisons. Net MeHg production was one order of magnitude higher (mean 13.8%, range 0.28-35) in the living or decomposing roots of floating or rooted macrophyte mats (Eichhornia azurea, E. crassipes, Paspalum sp., Eleocharis sellowiana, Salvinia sp., S. rotundifolia and Scirpus cubensis) than in the surface layer of underlying lake sediments (mean 0.6%, range 0.022-2.5). Methylation in flooded soils presented a wide range and was in some cases similar to the one found in macrophyte roots but usually much lower. In a Tapajos floodplain lake, natural concentrations of MeHg in soil and sediment cores taken along a lake-forest transect agreed well with data on net methylation potentials in the same samples. E. azurea, E. crassipes and Salvinia presented the highest methylation potentials, up to 113 times higher than in sediments. Methylation in E. azurea from six lakes of the Paraguay and Cuiaba rivers, high Pantanal, was determined in the 1998 dry and wet seasons and ranged from 1.8 to 35%. Methylation was lower in washed roots than in untreated roots of E. azurea and methylation in solids isolated from the roots, was higher than in sediments but lower than in untreated roots. This indicates that the methylation in roots zones occurs mainly in the root-associated solids. Floating meadows are sites of intense production of biomass and of highly bioavailable MeHg and appear to be an essential link of the MeHg cycle in tropical aquatic systems.

However, due to the scarcity of natural archives, South Africa's environmental evolution during the late Quaternary remains highly debated. Many available sediment archives are peri-coastal lakes and wetlands; however, the paleoenvironmental signals in these archives are often overprinted by sea-level changes during the Holocene. This study presents a new record from the coastal wetland Voelvlei, which is situated in the year-round rainfall zone of South Africa on the southern Cape coast. It presents an ideal sedimentary archive to investigate both sea level and environmental changes. A 13 m long sediment core was retrieved and analysed using a multi-proxy approach. The chronology reveals a basal age of 8440(+200)/(-250) cal BP. Paleoecological and elemental analyses indicate marine incursions from ca. 8440 to ca. 7000 cal BP with a salinity optimum occurring at 7090(+170)/(-200) cal BP. At ca. 6000 cal BP, the basin of Voelvlei was in-filled with sediment resulting in an intermittent (sporadically desiccated) freshwater lake similar to present. In contrast to previous investigations which used indirect proxies for hydrological reconstructions, here we apply a combined biomarker-sedimentological approach that allows the potential identification of precipitation sources, in combination with relative estimates of moisture availability. Increasing moisture is observed throughout the record starting from 8440(+200)/(-250) cal BP with contributions from both westerlies and easterlies from ca. 8440 to ca. 7070 cal BP. Westerly-derived rainfall dominates from ca. 7070 to ca. 6420 cal BP followed by a distinct shift to an easterly dominance at ca. 6420 cal BP. An overall trend to westerly dominance lasting until ca. 2060 cal BP is followed by a trend towards an easterly dominance to the present, but both phases show several intense, short-term variations. These variations are also evident in other regional studies, highlighting that the source and seasonality of precipitation has varied distinctly on the southern Cape during the Holocene. Comparison of the Voelvlei record with other regional studies suggests a coherent trend in the overall moisture evolution along the southern Cape coast during the past 8500 years.					; Struck, Julian/I-8882-2017; Szidat, Sonke/D-6706-2011; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021; Szidat, Sönke/D-6706-2011	Strobel, Paul/0000-0002-7860-5398; Klaes, Bjorn/0000-0002-9068-0278; Struck, Julian/0000-0001-6102-7547; Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Szidat, Sonke/0000-0002-1824-6207; Salazar, Gary/0000-0002-0425-5997; Frenzel, Peter/0000-0002-3821-4632; Bliedtner, Marcel/0000-0002-4109-9014; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				JUL 28	2021	17	4					1567	1586		10.5194/cp-17-1567-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1567-2021													WOS:000679663800001
J	Hassan, S; Schmieder, K; Böcker, R				Hassan, Siba; Schmieder, Klaus; Boecker, Reinhard			Spatial patterns of submerged macrophytes and heavy metals in the hypertrophic, contaminated, shallow reservoir Lake Qattieneh/Syria	LIMNOLOGICA												Our investigation on macrophytes in Lake Qattieneh, a large, shallow reservoir in western Syria, is a first assessment of ecological status of this lake. We studied spatial distribution patterns of aquatic macrophyte vegetation and heavy metal concentrations to determine if they can be used as indicators of point sources of pollution. Industrial and municipal point sources at the lake shore increase nutrient load and contamination by heavy metals. Water analyses revealed high concentrations of some heavy metals at some littoral sites: Ni 88.7 mu g L-1, Cr 49.99 mu g L-1, Co 14.38 mu g L-1, and Cu 11.65 mu g L-1. Despite hypertrophic conditions and high heavy metal contamination, we recorded several submerged macrophyte species with heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns. Whereas Potamogeton pectinatus L. dominates in the eastern part of the lake, near industrial point sources, both Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Potamogeton lucens L. form extended patches in the western part of the take. The shallow, littoral areas near villages are dominated by Ranunculus trichophyllus Chaix in Villars and Ceratophyllum demersum L. The west-east gradient in nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in waters and sediments are reflected by the spatial distribution of submersed species. While the heavy metal concentrations of the water body vary considerably in different seasons, the contents in submersed macrophytes integrate seasonal variations of longer time periods. Spatial distribution and tissue accumulation of littoral macrophyte species reflect the environmental conditions at respective sites such as heavy metal contents in water and sediment.

Chemical amplification in an invaded food web: Seasonality and ontogeny in a high-biomass, low-diversity ecosystem	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The global spread of invasive species is changing the structure of aquatic food webs worldwide. The North American Great Lakes have proved particularly vulnerable to this threat. In nearshore areas, invasive benthic species such as dreissenid mussels and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) have gained dominance in recent years. Such species are driving the flow of energy and material from the water column to the benthic zone, with dramatic effect on nutrient and contaminant cycling. Here, we develop a stage-structured model of a benthified food web in Lake Michigan with seasonal resolution and show how its bioaccumulation patterns differ from expected ones. Our model suggests that contaminant recycling through the consumption of lipid-rich fish eggs and mussel detritus is responsible for these differences. In southern Lake Michigan's Calumet Harbor (Chicago, IL, USA), round gobies have nitrogen isotope signatures with considerable spread, with some values higher than their predators and others lower than their prey. Contrary to patterns observed in linear pelagic systems, we predict that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in these fish decrease with increasing size due to the lipid- and benthos-enriched diets of smaller fish. We also present here round goby PCB concentrations measured in 2005 after an invasional succession in Calumet Harbor and demonstrate how the change from one invasive mussel species to another may have led to a decrease in round goby PCB accumulation. Our results suggest that benthic-dominated systems differ from pelagic ones chiefly due to the influence of detritus and that these effects are exacerbated in systems with low species diversity and high biomass.

Here, we produce seasonally resolved climate records from subarctic-Canada using micron-scale measurements of oxygen isotopes (delta 18O) in speleothems with apparent annual growth bands from three interglacial periods-Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11, 9, and 5e. We find 3 parts per thousand lower delta 18O values during MIS 11 than MIS 5e, despite MIS 11 likely being warmer. We explore controls on high-latitude speleothem delta 18O and suggest low MIS 11 delta 18O values reflect greater contribution of cold-season precipitation to dripwater from longer annual ground thaw durations. Other potential influences include changes in precipitation source and/or increased fraction of cold-season precipitation from diminished sea ice in MIS 11. Our study highlights the potential for high-latitude speleothems to yield detailed isotopic records of Northern Hemisphere interglacial climates beyond the reach of Greenland ice cores and offers a framework for interpreting them. Few climate records pre-dating the last ice age exist from high-latitude North America, which inhibits our understanding of how regions with permafrost responded to past warming and how they might change in the future. Here, we help fill this data gap by using six speleothems (cave mineral deposits) from a cave in the Northwest Territories, Canada to produce climate records that span thousands of years during former warm periods of Earth's history. We find that speleothems that grew during an exceptionally warm super-interglacial period 400,000 years ago have 3 parts per thousand lower oxygen isotope (delta 18O) values compared to those that grew during a likely cooler interglacial 125,000 years ago. We explore potential explanations for the difference in delta 18O across interglacials, and suggest that lower delta 18O values during warmer periods reflect greater infiltration of cool-season precipitation with longer annual ground thaw durations. This study highlights the importance of high-latitude speleothems to provide detailed climate records beyond the range available from Greenland ice cores. Long high-latitude terrestrial climate records are rare in the Northern Hemisphere High-latitude speleothems can provide ultra-high-resolution climate records beyond the reach of Greenland ice cores Mean oxygen isotopes of Arctic and subarctic speleothems likely are controlled by annual ground thaw durations					; Woodhead, Jon/C-2227-2012	Kinsley, Christopher/0000-0002-3185-520X; Batchelor, Cameron/0000-0003-4166-6901; Woodhead, Jon/0000-0002-7614-0136; Jost, Adam/0000-0002-3934-704X; McGee, David/0000-0002-7329-3428													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2024	51	8							e2024GL108459	10.1029/2024GL108459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108459													WOS:001200412900001

Results shown that the net load of nutrients from white soil is 34.1 kg ha(-1) for total nitrogen (TN), distributed as 19.4 kg ha(-1), in the rice season and 14.7 kg ha(-1) in the wheat season, and for total phosphorus (TP) 1.75 kg ha(-1), distributed as 1.16 kg ha(-1) in the rice season and 0.58 kg ha(-1) in the wheat season. The major chemical species of N loss is different in the two seasons. NH4-N is main the form in the rice season (53% of TN). NO3-N is the main form in wheat season (46% of TN). Particle-P is the main form in both seasons, ( about 56% of TP). The nutrient loss varied with time of the year. The main loss of nutrients happened in the 10 days after planting, 64% of TN and 42% of TP loss, respectively. Rainfall and fertilizer application are the key factors which influence nitrogen and phosphorus loss from arable land, especially rainfall events shortly after fertilizer application. So it is very important to improve the field management of the nutrients and water during the early days of planting.					; Guo, Hongyan/I-2252-2012; Zhang, Zhenke/AAH-8309-2020	Zhang, Zhenke/0000-0003-2751-1153; 													0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN-SEP	2004	26	2-3					209	219		10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039583.71423.b4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039583.71423.b4								15499776					WOS:000223553200013
J	Persic, A; Roche, H; Ramade, F				Persic, A; Roche, H; Ramade, F			Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope quantitative structural assessment of dominant species from the Vaccares Lagoon trophic web (Camargue Biosphere Reserve, France)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Vaccares Lagoon (Camargue Biosphere Reserve), a complex brackish ecosystem, is the natural habitat for numerous freshwater, marine and euryhaline species forming a particularly intricate food web. The main objectives of this study were to describe its trophic relations and investigate factors influencing its structure and dynamics. The combined stable C and N isotope method was used to establish a quantitative assessment of the trophic status of Vaccares organisms. Although the levels of delta(15)N and delta(13)C showed large intraspecific and interspecific variations, the isotopic signatures of the species assessed revealed a general trend of N-15 enrichment with trophic level. Distribution of the biota into four trophic compartments-depositivore, zooplanktivore, predator, and top-predator-was corroborated by the general analysis of the relationship between delta(13)C and delta(15)N. Analysis of seasonal and annual isotopic variations showed that natural environmental changes (increase in food abundance, climatic and salinity variations) as well as individual metabolic capacities would affect the relative stability of an organism's trophic position. No significant correlation was found between isotopic variation and size and growth in fishes except for the eel population where the positive correlation between these two parameters confirmed intra-population trophic variations. Finally, separately examined species exhibited significant, although incoherent, correlation between their isotopic signature and lipid content. This study confirms the efficiency of the isotopic approach in trophic studies and highlights the need for further investigations of anthropic environmental modifications occurring in this protected area and frequently disturbing its food web.

J	Heard, AM; Sickman, JO				Heard, Andrea M.; Sickman, James O.			Nitrogen assessment points: development and application to high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California	ECOSPHERE												Increased nitrogen (N) inputs to oligotrophic high-elevation lakes are contributing to long-term eutrophication, changes in nutrient cycles, and shifts in phytoplankton communities. State of California water quality standards do not adequately protect mountain lake ecosystems from atmospheric deposition, including lakes in national parks and other protected areas. The development of quantitative nutrient assessment points based on measurable ecological effects specific to high-elevation lakes is an important step in long-term protection of these ecosystems. We conducted in situ bioassay experiments during the phytoplankton growing season and modeled the response of phytoplankton to nutrient additions using algal growth models. Phytoplankton responded to nutrient additions (N and N + phosphorus) in five of seven experiments conducted in N-limited lakes. Results were modeled using Michaelis-Menten, Monod, and dose-response curves and used to calculate effective doses (ED) for excess phytoplankton growth. The 10%, 50%, and 90% ED estimates were determined for early and late hydrologic seasons. Results for the 10% ED were 0.33 (early hydrologic season) and 0.89 (late hydrologic season), the 50% ED were 1.0 mu mol/L (early hydrologic season) and 4.0 mu mol/L (late hydrologic season), and the 90% ED were 3.1 mu mol/L (early hydrologic season) and 18 mu mol/L (late hydrologic season). We then applied these assessment points to lake chemistry data from the National Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring Program to assess the status of lakes across Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks. Mean nitrate concentration during the growing season was 4.58 mu mol/L and ranged from <0.04 to 11.8 mu mol/L (n = 75). The 10% ED were exceeded by 28% (late hydrologic season) and 37% (early hydrologic season) of lakes, the 50% ED were exceeded by 18% (late hydrologic season) and 29% (early hydrologic season) of lakes, and the 90% ED were exceeded by 0.0% (late hydrologic season) and 21% (early hydrologic season) of lakes. Our results suggest that phytoplankton populations in many Sierra Nevada lakes are affected by N deposition based on exceedance of growth assessment points. The most sensitive lakes are typically found at higher elevations in watersheds with steep, north-facing slopes and minimal vegetation.																			2150-8925					NOV	2016	7	11							e01586	10.1002/ecs2.1586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1586													WOS:000392207600012
J	Hudson, PF; Colditz, RR				Hudson, PF; Colditz, RR			Flood delineation in a large and complex alluvial valley, lower Panuco basin, Mexico	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Determining the extent of flooding is an important role of the hydrological research community and provides a vital service to planners and engineers. For large river systems located within distant settings it is practical to utilize a remote sensing approach. This study combines a remote sensing and geomorphic approach to delineate the extent of a large hurricane generated flood event in the lower Panuco basin (98,227 km(2)), the seventh largest river system draining into the Gulf of Mexico. The lower Panuco basin is located within the coastal plain of eastern Mexico and has a complex alluvial valley. Data sources included a Landsat 5TM and Landsat 7ETM(+) scene, and topographic and particle size data from fieldwork and laboratory analysis. The Landsat 5TM image was acquired after the peak of a large flood event in 1993, whereas the Landsat 7ETM(+) scene was acquired during the dry season in 2000. The increasing number of days between flood crest and the date of flood image acquisition along the river valley provided the opportunity to examine several methods of flood delineation and to consider differences in floodplain geomorphology. Backswamp environments were easily delineated in flooded reaches within the Panuco and Tamuin valleys, whereas in the Moctezuma valley more sophisticated methods were required because of the greater time between image acquisition and flood peak, and the complex floodplain topography. This included Principal Component (PC) analysis and image classification. Within the floodplain, residual Holocene terraces complicated flood mapping. Classification of both images allowed consideration of the influence of permanent standing water. Although the flooded areas were greater in the lower reaches of the study area, because this portion of the valley contained large floodplain lakes, the amount of inundation was actually lower. Remote sensing offers the ability to examine large alluvial valleys in distant settings but does not imply that geomorphic criteria should be excluded. Indeed, because of heterogeneous floodplain topography this study illustrates the Importance of including field based geomorphic analysis so that the complexity of distinct floodplain environments are considered. The findings from this study are significant because most remote sensing data obtained for the purpose of flood mapping will not coincide with the flood crest. Thus, this study provides an appropriate method for mapping flood inundation in large and complex floodplain settings after flood crest recession. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Swezey, C				Swezey, C			Eolian sediment responses to late Quaternary climate changes: temporal and spatial patterns in the Sahara	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper presents a compilation of eolian-based records of late Quaternary climate changes in the Sahara. Although the data are relatively sparse, when viewed as a whole, they reveal a general pattern of widespread eolian sediment mobilization prior to 11,000 cal. years BP, eolian sediment stabilization from 11,000 to 5000 cal. years BP, and a return to widespread eolian sediment mobilization after 5000 cal. years sp. Furthermore, an eolian-based record from southern Tunisia reveals the existence of millennial-scale changes in eolian sediment behavior. These: millennial-scale variations provide examples of eolian sediment responses to climate changes at a scale intermediate between seasonal and orbital ('Milankovitch') changes, and they are also coincident with abrupt atmospheric and oceanic changes. The general synchroneity of the eolian stratigraphic records and their coincidence with various oceanic and atmospheric changes suggest that global forcing mechanisms have influenced late Quaternary eolian sediment behavior in the Sahara.

However, high-resolution spatiotemporal tracking of the variations and vegetation dynamics of RDAs remains challenging because they often change dramatically and are controlled by both human activities and natural factors. Herein, a modified image fusion method was proposed to capture rapid variations in RDAs by integrating impact factor information into the analysis. The capability of the proposed method was tested in the Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir as it is the largest artificial freshwater lake in Asia with a highly variable RDA, since it is surrounded by gently sloping plains or hills. The results showed that the modified workflow produced reliable predictions (r = 0.83, RMSE = 0.097) compared with the original Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) workflow (r = 0.60, RMSE = 0.195), demonstrating improved capability for mapping water surface changes and vegetation dynamics. Using the proposed method, the 15-d variations in the RDA were derived from 2013 to 2022 with a 30-m resolution. The interannual maximum RDA was estimated to be 278 km2 after the dam was elevated in 2013. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decreased as inundation frequency (IF) increased. Mean NDVI in the growing season (May-October) decreased by 0.109 (17.6 %) and 0.156 (26.0 %) under 30 %-40 % IF and 60 %-70 % IF, respectively, compared with the vegetation under 0 %-10 % IF, which was referred as "natural" vegetation considering its rare inundation. Moreover, the mean growing season length decreased to only 63 and 19 d for 30 %-40 % IF and 60 %-70 % IF, respectively. Furthermore, 77.3 % of the RDA exhibited a decrease in NDVI, whereas 22.7 % showed an unusual increase, possibly due to the selection of dominant species welladapted to inundation during vegetation succession. Overall, this study not only proposed a new method for the high spatiotemporal monitoring of RDAs, but also highlighted the importance of variations and vegetation dynamics within RDAs for accurate estimation of their carbon budgets.					; Liu, Pan/E-9344-2011; Cheng, Lei/J-5552-2013	Fu, Chenhao/0000-0003-2104-8380; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				MAY	2024	129								103855	10.1016/j.jag.2024.103855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103855		APR 2024											WOS:001234648200001

Spatial patterns of rainbow smelt energetic condition in Lakes Huron and Erie in 2017: Evidence for Lake Huron resource limitation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a key planktivore and prey fish in Lake Huron. Given the declining offshore productivity in the lake since the early 2000s, we described the energy content of rainbow smelt in 2017 across five different regions (North Channel, Georgian Bay, Saginaw Bay, northern main basin, southern main basin) where phytoplankton and zooplankton productivity likely varied. To increase contrast across the productivity gradient, rainbow smelt energy content was also estimated from western Lake Erie. Within the North Channel where large fish (>= 90 mm, total length) were sampled most frequently, mean energy density (kJ/g wet weight) varied seasonally: 4.29 in April (month of spawning), 3.86 in June, 3.99 in July, and up to 435 in September. Energy density of rainbow smelt from higher productivity western Lake Erie was 37% (large fish 90 mm) to 60% higher (small fish <90 mm) than that of fish from Lake Huron. Within Lake Huron, energy density of rainbow smelt from North Channel was slightly higher than those from other regions; rainbow smelt from Georgian Bay generally had the lowest energy density. Across regions, including western Lake Erie, energy density increased with chlorophyll a concentration. Compared with Lake Huron studies prior to 2004, when oligotrophication had not yet accelerated, energy density of rainbow smelt in 2017 was up to 31% lower. The decline in rainbow smelt energy density is likely the result of declining primary and secondary pelagic production and increased resource limitation for planktivorous fish.

Both species had similar food composition consisting of zooplankton and detritus. However, diet composition of both species significantly varied amongst lakes, and particularly so for P. semilunaris with seasonal and ontogenetic differences. Diet composition and seasonal/ontogenetic differences were overall similar to other populations of these gobiid species from both their native and nonnative ranges. The present findings suggest high plasticity in the diet of these two gobies, which can opportunistically utilize available food resources.					; Karakus, Nildeniz/AAB-5049-2022; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/IXD-6486-2023; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/C-6263-2012	KARAKUS, NILDENIZ/0000-0001-8490-6261; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8103-885X													1434-2944	1522-2632				AUG	2019	104	3-4					57	67		10.1002/iroh.201801974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201801974													WOS:000483555000002

This is consistent with the power law that characterizes size frequency distributions. While many previous studies have used the estimated exponent in size spectra as a metric to assess external perturbations, limited empirical studies have focused on the fitting methods. Here, we compared the effects caused by fitting methods and distribution models based on one-year pelagic fish data from Daya Bay, China. Our empirical results showed that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is more suitable than traditional normalized biomass spectra (NBS), and that a power law is not always the best model when using MLE. Moreover, we found significant size structure variation in different seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear mixed effects model (LMM) results showed that temperature was the major factor in seasonal environmental variation, and fish migration might be the essential response strategy causing size structure changes. The estimated exponents and nonlinear structure indicated that the Daya Bay is under intensive human impact. Our results suggest that MLE methods are recommended in future size-based studies, and that environmental variation and migration patterns are crucial in understanding seasonal community structure changes.

J	Luo, YQ; Ierapetritou, M				Luo, Yuqing; Ierapetritou, Marianthi			Design and operation of modular biorefinery supply chain under uncertainty using generalized Benders decomposition	AICHE JOURNAL												Biomass supply chain performance is heavily affected by uncertainties stemming from supply, demand, or unexpected disruptions. Unlike petrochemical plants that use crude oil, biorefineries often have to deal with the uneven spatial-temporal distribution of feedstock supply. The modular production strategy provides more flexibility in chemical manufacturing by allowing fast capacity expansion and unit movement. However, modeling and optimizing modular biomass supply chain under uncertainties becomes challenging due to high dimensionality and the existence of discrete decisions. This work optimizes the multiperiod biomass supply chain using the rolling horizon planning and two-stage stochastic programming framework. We then applied generalized Benders decomposition to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming supply chain optimization. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic programming could be used to quantitatively describe the life-cycle assessment uncertainties of the biomass supply chain performance, demonstrating seasonality and random variability.					; Ierapetritou, Marianthi/GVT-1369-2022; Luo, Yuqing/JZT-8171-2024	Luo, Yuqing/0000-0002-4174-946X; 													0001-1541	1547-5905				AUG	2024	70	8								10.1002/aic.18458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aic.18458		APR 2024											WOS:001206773000001

Genetic data from the maternally mouthbrooding cichlid fish Simochromis pleurospilus revealed the opposite pattern low polyandry and allomaternal care. More than 70% of the investigated females had mated with a single male, and 14% of the females had unrelated fry in their broods. Broods with foreign fry were in the late stage of brood care, in which females guard free-swimming fry and recall the broods into their mouths for protection. With one exception, fostering females were related to their adopted fry at the level of first cousins (RQG > 0.12), but relatedness between fosters and adopted fry was not significantly higher than between fosters and fry tended by other females. Relatedness among breeders extended to the level of first-order relatives. Mean relatedness among contemporaneously breeding dams (RQG = 0.08) was significantly higher than among dams breeding in different seasons (RQG = -0.04), which suggests a temporal or spatial concentration of mouthbrooding relatives. Indeed, females sometimes brood in small groups. This behaviour may reduce brood predation but will increase the risk of brood mixing, which is possibly mitigated by low costs of brood care and indirect benefits accrued by relatedness among the breeders in the group. Remarkably, the apparent inbreeding potential did not give rise to bet-hedging polyandry or active avoidance of relatives, as half of the mated individuals were related at RQG > 0.13 and polyandry did not coincide with high within-pair relatedness.					; Koblmüller, Stephan/AFI-3908-2022	Koblmuller, Stephan/0000-0002-1024-3220; Taborsky, Barbara/0000-0003-1690-8155; Sefc, Kristina/0000-0001-8108-8339													0962-1083	1365-294X				JUN	2012	21	11					2805	2815		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05573.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05573.x								22493973					WOS:000304389500020

Individual resting eggs were obtained from a large selection of lakes which were representative of five endorheic basins and the chain of coastal ponds in the Iberian Peninsula. The novel use of resting eggs allows the integration of seasonal and annual variations as well as the impact of stochastic effects such a drift and local extinction. A 653 bp fragment of the mitochonrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was sequenced from 98 eggs. Our results revealed a deep phylogeographical structure in this species, with a division into two main lineages with distinct geographical distributions, which probably diverged at the beginning of the Pleistocene period. Most of the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were restricted to single lakes. Nested clade analysis supported Early Pleistocene fragmentation of populations, low gene flow and some long-distance colonization. These conclusions contrast strongly with previous ideas on rotifer biogeography and this pattern is consistent with a recolonization of the Iberian Peninsula from two glacial refugia. The results provide new insights into the processes responsible for the genetic diversification of passive dispersers, a life-history trait typical of zooplanktonic biotas.

When the grass wasn't greener: Megafaunal ecology and paleodroughts	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 42,000-year record of coprophilous fungal (Sporormiella, Podospora, Cercophora), fossil pollen and charcoal data assessed megafaunal use of woodland versus grassland settings in Central American landscapes by Pleistocene megafauna. The sedimentary record from Lake Peten-Itza showed that vegetation growing around the lake shifted between scrub grasslands, Pinus-dominated woodlands, Quercus-dominated woodlands, and tropical seasonal forest. A series of regression analyses and probabilistic models revealed that vegetation assemblages and temperature influenced the abundance of coprophilous fungus, a proxy for megafaunal abundance. We found that megafaunal populations were almost continuously present around Peten-Itza during the Pleistocene, and that the peak abundances appear to have been associated with cool, moist Quercus-rich parklands. In contrast, the lowest inputs of coprophilous fungi occurred during cold, dry events when scrub grasslands expanded. The dry grasslands may have been nutrient-limited, offering poor quality grazing for megafauna. The decline of the Pleistocene megafauna at Peten-Itzawas a multi-stage event, with a series of population collapses prior to an inferred local extirpation c. 13,600 years ago. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and phenol oxidase activities were determined over a 2-year period in 30 piezometers spread in an area of approximately 100 km(2). Taking into account all enzymes, piezometers, and seasons, EEA ranged over several orders of magnitude, from 1.01 Au 10(-5) +/- 2.92 Au 10(-6) to 1.37 +/- 0.13 nmol (methylumbelliferyl, amido-4-methylcoumarin, or dihydroxyphenylalanine) mL(-1) h(-1). The quality, much more than the quantity, of organic matter and nutrients seemed to be the major variables that controlled the spatiotemporal patterns showed by EEA. EEA patterns obtained in this study agree with several functional models of microbial communities, such as optimal resource allocation and nutrient co-limitation. This study probably represents the first one in which these functional models have been tested in subsurface systems. Results obtained in this study seem to suggest that microbial communities inhabiting groundwaters in Doana are not dead or compromised cells. By contrast, these communities play relevant roles in carbon and nutrient cycling, continue with the decomposition process that begins in the sediments of the shallow lakes located in the area, provide remineralized carbon and nutrients to producers of these surface aquatic systems, and close energy and matter cycles. This study proposes that groundwater systems should be considered dynamic systems, comparable in functional complexity to surface systems.

Biofilms on artificial substrata were sampled at 8 sites in the lake during different seasons. The responses of biofilms to land use and water quality changes were analyzed. The biofilm structural and functional attributes fluctuated seasonally. All attributes we tested differed significantly with different land use. Generally, biomass and enzyme activities increased, whereas chl c/a decreased with human disturbance. Attributes were strongly correlated to environmental variables, especially the trophic status of the lake. Overall, biofilms were good indicators of macrophyte-dominated lake health. The proportions of Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta, Chlorophyll-a, b, chlorophyll-b/a, chlorophyll-c/a, algal density, beta-glucosidase, aminopeptidase and ash-free dry weight of biofilms are recommended as tools for assessing responses to land use changes, and for monitoring the effectiveness of ecosystem rehabilitation.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2011	20	5			SI		982	992		10.1007/s10646-011-0677-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-011-0677-2								21503613					WOS:000291887500007
J	Mallol, C				Mallol, Carolina			What's in a beach? Soil micromorphology of sediments from the Lower Paleolithic site of 'Ubeidiya, Israel	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												A micromorphological study of archaeological sediments from the early Pleistocene site of 'Ubeidiya (Jordan Valley, Israel) was conducted to provide microenvironmental detail for the hominin occupation contexts and investigate site formation issues. Previous research shows that the hominin groups occupied the marshes and pebbly beaches at the shores of a lake during a regressive period, but given that some portions of the lithic and faunal assemblages are abraded and others fresh, there remains a question of whether the archaeological assemblages are in situ or reworked, and if reworked, by what mechanisms and from where. The rates of sedimentation within the regressive cycle, by which we can learn about the frequency and duration of exposed surfaces amenable for hominin occupation is also unknown. Finally, the artificial nature of some of the pebbly layers has been questioned. The micromorphological analysis yielded the identification of twelve microfacies; the majority of these represent fluvially derived floodplain soils or distal mudflow deposits, and a minor number are sediments of lacustrine origin: mudflats and shallow subaqueous sediments. These represent the natural habitats of the 'Ubeidiya hominins and might serve as a reference to similar contexts of other early hominin sites. The sedimentary model proposed here entails the rapid deposition of fluvially derived low-energy sediments at and around the shoreline, followed by prolonged periods of exposure, during which surfaces stabilized within a relatively wet, marshy environment. This interpretation suggests that the abraded portions of the archaeological assemblages are a result of prolonged surface exposure rather than high-energy transport from a distant source or to wave reworking at the shoreline, and supports the consideration of these assemblages as archaeological palimpsests, with locally reworked fresh and abraded elements. No micromorphological evidence supporting anthropogenic agency in the formation of the pebbly layers was found. The entire regressive cycle entailed unvarying climatic conditions with seasonal fluctuations and episodic lacustrine incursions, and with a trend towards and conditions in the end.

Abundance of microplastics in surface water of tropical reservoirs during contrasted season, the case of Dau Tieng and Tri An, Vietnam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Microplastic concentrations were studied in surface waters of two reservoirs playing an important role in water storage and supply in Vietnam, the Dau Tieng and Tri An reservoirs, by collecting water samples during dry and rainy seasons. Microplastic mean concentration (including all sites and seasons per reservoir) was of 3.96 +/- 1.38 items m-3 at Dau Tieng and 4.04 +/- 1.35 items m-3 at Tri An, and is in the range of concentrations found in other reservoirs studied worldwide. We noted that microplastic spatial distribution was driven by difference levels of anthropogenic activities and population density surrounding each area of the reservoirs. Between the two seasons, microplastic mean abundance did not change at the level of the Dau Tieng reservoir (4.36 +/- 1.71 items m-3 and 3.57 +/- 0.95 items m-3 during dry and rainy season, respectively), but their value significantly decreased at specific sites under intense anthropogenic activities during the rainy season. Meanwhile, in Tri An reservoir, mean microplastic abundance and size significantly decrease during the rainy season. Although the mean abundances are low value, ecological concern needs to be addressed because of the important touristic activities and their potential impact to the quality of the water and to the agriculture development of the surrounding areas. We therefore questioned microplastic as a new parameter to include into local environmental monitoring network, and we recommended to consider microplastic as an important parameter in the monitoring control of the surface water quality of the two reservoirs.					strady, emilie/O-1219-2016; STRADY, Emilie/O-1219-2016	strady, emilie/0000-0001-5683-0810; Kieu-Le, Thuy-Chung/0000-0003-3216-0191													1735-1472	1735-2630				NOV	2024	21	15					9391	9408		10.1007/s13762-024-05543-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-024-05543-6		APR 2024											WOS:001205045600002

Erythemal ultraviolet radiation exposure of high school rowers in Aotearoa/New Zealand	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												Athletes who compete in outdoor sports can receive potentially harmful levels of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Rowing is a popular outdoor sport that takes place during the peak UVR season. Using electronic dosimeters attached to the shoulder strap of the rower's uniform, this study aimed to quantify the real-time solar UVR exposure experienced by high school rowers during competition. We measured personal UVR exposure (PE) during the time spent on the water in order to compete in a single rowing-race (race-time), when rowing administrators are responsible for athletes' wellbeing. Data collection took place in Aotearoa (New Zealand) at Lake Ruataniwha (44.28 degrees S, 170.07 degrees E), during two consecutive rowing seasons (December-February 2018-19 and 2019-20). Analysis of dosimeter data generated from 56 race-times over five regattas revealed a median personal UVR exposure (PE) of 1.15 standard erythemal dose (SED), where 1 SED is defined as an effective radiant exposure of 100 Jm(-2). Mean race-time was 46 min. Over two-thirds of race-times (69.6%) exceeded the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency recommendation of 1 SED being considered safe for most people in a day. An exposure of 1.5-3.0 SED produces perceptible erythema for people with light coloured skin and the lower parameter of 1.5 SED was exceeded in 14 (25.0%) of the race-times. By regatta, the median SED/h ranged from 0.96-2.40 and the median percentage of total concurrent ambient UVR ranged from 17 to 31%. Our results indicate that rowing is a high UVR sport and that races outside of peak UVR times also warrant the use of sun protection even when the UVI < 3. Given that acute and cumulative UVR exposure are recognised risk factors in the development of ocular diseases and skin cancers later in life, risk management guidelines for competitive school rowing will be incomplete until a long-term approach to well-being is considered and comprehensive sun protection measures adopted.

J	Van Buskirk, J				Van Buskirk, J			Habitat partitioning in European and North American pond-breeding frogs and toads	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Distributions of species along a freshwater habitat gradient, ranging from ephemeral pools with few predators to permanent lakes with fish, have been used to infer how predation establishes trade-offs that promote ecological specialization. Larval anurans are said to support the trade-off model, but there are few comparable and quantitative habitat data available to assess this claim. I performed a survey of field biologists to evaluate the habitats of similar sets of species in the northern parts of Europe (40 respondents and 12 species) and eastern North America (30 respondents and 8 species), using a standard set of criteria. For six European species I also had quantitative field sampling data, and found close agreement between survey results and predator densities experienced by tadpoles in the field. Distributions of most species were restricted to only part of the habitat gradient, as expected under the trade-off model. The survey confirmed reports that North American Rana species replace one another along the gradient, but this was not true in Europe. European Rana were no different from the North American species in their seasonal and geographical overlap, so the absence of habitat partitioning in European Rana may result from interactions with other species or the special impact of glaciation in Europe. Habitats were unrelated to evolutionary relationships among species, suggesting that changes in habitat evolve quickly. The survey approach was useful for comparing distributions of species, and for generating hypotheses about evolutionary responses to habitat gradients.																			1366-9516					SEP	2003	9	5					399	410																WOS:000185113600006

Food niche segregation between two herbivorous cyprinid species in a turbid lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diet and growth of two cyprinids, roach Rutilus rutilus and rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus, in the clay-turbid Kirkkojarvi basin in Lake Hiidenvesi (Finland) were studied. Young R. rutilus fed mainly on detritus, molluscs, chironomids and zooplankton, while older individuals consumed mostly detritus, molluscs and filamentous algae. In the food of S. erythrophthalmus, detritus was less prevalent and animal food and plants contributed to most of the diets. The animal food of S. erythrophthalmus consisted mostly of surface insects. Of the plant food, the macrophytes Potamogeton obtusifolius and Ranunculus circinatus had the highest representation, while the proportion of filamentous algae was low. The growth rate of S. erythrophthalmus was significantly higher than that of R. rutilus. The results suggested that the species composition of vascular macrophytes was not favourable for R. rutilus. Small submerged species suitable for R. rutilus were absent and they fed on filamentous algae and detritus, which resulted in a slow growth rate. The results suggested that in a clay-turbid lake the food spectrum is more suitable for S. erythrophthalmus than for R. rutilus. In such conditions, R. rutilus may have no benefit from its generalistic feeding abilities.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				OCT	2009	75	6					1230	1243		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02359.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02359.x								20738611					WOS:000271523700008

The volatile compounds and sensory notes of 'Casaliva' and 'Leccino' olive oils from 16 olive orchards near lake Garda. northern Italy, were analyzed for three years. Results showed that in this specific mesoclimate the aromatic olive oil quality depends firstly on the year and secondly on the cultivar. 'Casaliva' oils showed a higher content of volatiles (aldehydes and compounds from LOX) and phenols, higher 'green', 'fruity' and 'taste' notes than 'Leccino'. The most effective in separating cultivars were: trans-2-hexenal. cis-2-penten-1-ol, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, total phenols, 'lawn', 'olives' and 'bitter' sensory descriptors. The cultivar x year interaction also significantly differentiated and characterized quality and typicality of oils. Moreover, this study showed that oils volatile compounds were more significant than sensory evaluation in discriminating the cultivars and the years. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Light harvesting pigments such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a) can be used to understand marine primary productivity, especially phytoplankton abundance. Sea surface temperature is closely linked with phytoplankton abundance and climatic changes. The objective of the current study is to determine spatial and temporal variations of chl-a and sea surface temperature and their co-variation, over 12 years using statistical methodologies and Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Cloud Computing Approach. In this study, the available sea surface temperature and chl-a data acquired from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor were proceeded through Google Earth Engine and Earth Science Data System. Data visualization was carried out using ArcMap (TM) software. Results show a weak negative linear relationship (-0.40, P < 0.05) between sea surface temperature and chl-a. Therefore, additional favorable environmental factors such as coastal upwelling, and nutrient discharge through river run-off can control the primary productivity of phytoplankton. We also illustrated spatial and temporal maps for chl-a and sea surface temperature distribution in the exclusive economic zone of Sri Lanka. Chlorophyll-a concentration is enhanced during the southwest monsoon, and the lowest concentration is observed during the first inter-monsoon period. Next, the highest sea surface temperature is recorded during the first inter-monsoon period, and the lowest sea surface temperature is observed during the northeast monsoon.

Climate influences on water and sediment properties of Genovesa Crater Lake, Galapagos	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Genovesa Crater Lake is a remote, hypersaline lake in the northern Galapagos archipelago that contains a finely laminated sediment record. This sediment record has the potential to provide a high-resolution history of past climate variability in the eastern tropical Pacific. Here we present modern climate, lake, and sediment observations from 2009 to 2012 to explore how local climate variability influences Genovesa Crater Lake and its sediments. Surface lake temperature is strongly linked to air temperature and is highly seasonal. Temperature stratification is strongest during the warm season, whereas temperature becomes more uniform through the water column in the cool season. Deeper and earlier mixing occurred during the 2010 La Nia, which subsequently delayed 2011 cool season mixing and maximum warm season surface temperatures in 2011 and 2012. Lake salinity changes are influenced by precipitation, evaporation and persistent seawater influx. The largest declines in subsurface salinity follow months after the rainy season, when temperatures cool and fresher surface water from the previous warm/wet season mixes into the subsurface. Between 2009 and 2012, more calcium carbonate precipitated during a period of higher salinity. The period of highest calcium carbonate abundance measured in sediment records that span the late nineteenth to twentieth century coincides with the failure of two consecutive rainy seasons in 1988 and 1989 as well as the coldest monthly sea surface temperature measured at Puerto Ayora in 1989. More calcium carbonate-rich laminae from AD 1550 +/- A 70 to 1675 +/- A 90 may indicate a greater frequency of prolonged droughts or cooler temperatures, although enhanced productivity may also modulate carbonate precipitation. More Ca-rich laminae in Genovesa coincide with dry conditions inferred from other Galapagos sediment proxies, as well as prolonged dry and cool conditions inferred from reconstructions of the Southern Oscillation Index and NINO3 sea surface temperatures.

Pollen assemblages from the diamicton (ca. 11,000-10,700 cal. yr BP) are dominated by Pre-Quatemary spores and redeposited Pinaceae pollen, pointing to a high terrestrial input. Turbid and nutrient-poor conditions existed in the lake ca. 10,700-10,550 cal. yr BP. The chironomid-inferred reconstructions suggest that mean July temperature increased rapidly from 10.0 to 11.8 degrees C during this period. Sparse, treeless vegetation dominated on the disturbed and denuded soils in the catchment area. A distinct dominance of planktonic diatoms ca. 10,500-8800 cal. yr BP points to the lowest lake-ice coverage, the longest growing season and the highest bioproductivity during the lake history. Birch forest with some shrub alder grew around the lake reflecting the warmest climate conditions during the Holocene. Mean July temperature was likely 11-13 degrees C and annual precipitation-400-500 turn. The period ca. 8800-5500 cal. yr BP is characterized by a gradual deterioration of environmental conditions in the lake and lake catchment. The pollen- and chironomid-inferred temperatures reflect a warm period (ca. 6500-6000 cal. BP) with a mean July temperature at least 1-2 degrees C higher than today. Birch forests disappeared from the lake vicinity after 6000 cal. yr BP. The vegetation in the Lyadhej-To region became similar to the modem one. Shrub (Betula nana, Salix) and herb tundra have dominated the lake catchment since ca. 5500 cal. yr BP. All proxies suggest rather harsh environmental conditions. Diatom assemblages reflect relatively short growing seasons and a longer persistence of lake-ice ca. 5500-2500 cal. yr BP. Pollen-based climate reconstructions suggest significant cooling between ca. 5500 and 3500 cal. yr BP with a mean July temperature 8-10 degrees C and annual precipitation-300-400 mm. The bioproductivity in the lake remained low after 2500 cal. yr BP, but biogeochemical proxies reflect a higher terrestrial influx. Changes in the diatom content may indicate warmer water temperatures and a reduced ice cover on the lake. However, chironomid-based reconstructions reflect a period with minimal temperatures during the lake history. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

There is little information on the factors that explain the temporal changes in biotic communities in the high-mountain reservoirs that provide water to the city of Bogota (Colombia). Our objective was to identify the environmental factors controlling the biomass and composition of algal communities in four tropical high-mountain reservoirs. We hypothesised that hydraulic dynamics is the major determining factor in temporal changes in phytoplankton communities in tropical mountain reservoirs regardless of the nutrient concentration in the system. We studied the temporal changes in phytoplankton over five years in four reservoirs that exhibit different nutrient concentrations and hydraulic management regimes. The phytoplankton in all of the reservoirs were characterised by the dominance of Dinophyceae. Canonical correspondence analyses and Pearson's correlations showed that the water renewal rate primarily explains the phytoplankton composition, followed by total nitrogen, total phosphorous and silicates. The effect of the water renewal rate was different depending on the particular conditions in each system; thus, in reservoirs with greater hydraulic dynamics, the water renewal rate explained the selection of secondary species and dominant species adapted to a broad range of environmental conditions. In the reservoir with a higher physical stability, eventual changes in the water renewal rate shifted the dominant species, reduced diversity and altered phytoplankton succession. In the reservoir with the largest volume and lowest nutrient concentration, phytoplankton species were selected primarily based on chemical and physical variables related to climatic seasonality. Our results suggest that the model for hydraulic management of the reservoirs plays an important role: in highly dynamic reservoirs, there is a direct causal relationship between phytoplankton and physical variables such as stability and water renewal rate; in less dynamic environments, phytoplankton species growth responds primarily to water chemistry.

Integration of monthly water balance modeling and nutrient load estimation in an agricultural catchment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Non-point sources pollution has become a serious environmental problem in the aquatic systems throughout the world. The Xitiaoxi catchment is located in the southwest of Taihu Basin, contributing large amounts of runoff and associated nutrients to Taihu Lake. Thus, identifying critical non-point sources pollution in this catchment is urgent and essential to control water pollution, improve the water quality, and reduce the pollutants drained into water bodies. The present study integrated a monthly water balance model with the export coefficient model for total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads estimation in the Xitiaoxi catchment in southeastern China. The simulated monthly runoff are in good agreement with the observed streamflow at both Hengtangcun and Fanjiancun stations with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients higher than 0.80. The predictions showed reasonable ranges from 1687 to 2046 t/y (2002-2005) for total nitrogen loads, and from 106 to 157 t/y for total phosphorus loads (1999-2007), respectively, which are consistent with the observed values at Hengtangcun. Overall, the monthly export coefficient model coupling monthly water balance simulation to export coefficient model presented both the seasonal dynamics and magnitude for streamflow and nutrients loads, which generally match well with the observations. These findings demonstrate that the proposed model can provide encouraging results and can be used as an efficient tool to identify the pollution sources for planning and management of large-scale agricultural catchment.					; yalan, zhang/AAH-9178-2019	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; 													1735-1472					WIN	2012	9	1					163	172		10.1007/s13762-011-0010-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-011-0010-x													WOS:000300149200018

High variability of phytoplankton photosynthesis in response to environmental forcing in oligotrophic Lake Malawi/Nyasa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In southern Lake Malawi, seasonal pelagic chlorophyll means were 1.0 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1 in the deep mixing season (DMS) (May-August), 0.8 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1 in the dry stratified season (DSS) (September to November) and 0.7 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1 in the wet stratified season (WSS) (December to April). Despite the low variability in chlorophyll, there was a wide range in chlorophyll specific photosynthetic activity. The photosynthetic parameters, P-m(b) (the light saturated rate) and alpha(b) (the light limited slope), varied significantly among seasons and were highly positively correlated, with lowest values in the DSS and highest values in WSS. During deep mixing, P-m(b) did not covary with alpha(b); and the light saturation index, E-k (= P-m(b)/alpha(b)), varied in response to changes in alpha(b) rather than in P-m(b). Phytoplankton appeared to be nutrient deficient at all times but less deficient during deep vertical mixing in the DMS. Average daily rates of integrated phytoplankton primary productivity were lowest in the DSS (337 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and highest in the WSS (629 mg C m-2 d-1) despite nearly identical mean chlorophyll concentrations. Along a near shore transect off the Linthipe River, chlorophyll concentrations were higher and more variable (1.4 +/- 1.3 mu g L-1), phytoplankton were not strongly nutrient deficient and chlorophyll specific photosynthetic activity was as high or higher than at the offshore station. Estimates of phytoplankton productivity in this tropical great lake must account for spatial and temporal variability in photosynthetic parameters imposed by seasonal changes in mixing dynamics.

Macro-regional interconnections among ancient hunter-gatherers of the Cis-Baikal, Eastern Siberia (Russia)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We provide a multi-scalar investigation of interactions among hunter-gatherers in the Cis-Baikal region of Eastern Siberia during the transition to the Bronze Age (4900-3700 cal BP). We review and synthesize published data on burial goods and isotopic variation to reconstruct interconnections that existed both within and between hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting the Cis-Baikal's distinct micro-regions, as well as macro-regional interconnections between the Cis-Baikal and neighboring regions of Eurasia. While an extensive body of English-language literature has recently been published on the prehistory of the Cis-Baikal, this literature does not address patterning in the archaeological record at the macro-regional scale. The data we discuss here suggest that by the Bronze Age, Cis-Baikal hunter-gatherers shared several of the hallmark developments that characterized the Bronze Age of the Eurasian Steppe. We attempt to situate the Cis-Baikal within its broader geographic and historical context, and suggest that despite the absence of food production (e.g., herding) in the region at this time, local hunter-gatherers' mobility practices involving seasonal movement and periodic aggregation enabled these groups to participate in networks of interaction that developed throughout the larger region in the Bronze Age.

Although the lake is shallow (similar to 4.7 m), it shows a strong meromixis. The permanent chemocline which is connected with stable density stratification, separates the mixolimnion from the anoxic monimolimnion at a variable depth of only 0.6-1.9 m. We conducted a tracer experiment, injecting similar to 3 mu mol of anthropogenic gas SF6 into the monimolimnion. With monthly measured vertical concentration profiles extended over 2 years we detected and quantified the groundwater coupling. An exchange time close to once per year was estimated for the monimolimnion by balancing the tracer. From CTD casts and thermistor chain data we extracted additional information about mixing. For the water and tracer balances, we included the erosion of the monimolimnion surface by strong daily convective mixing in the mixolimnion during the warm period. SF6 background measurements before spiking indicate that diffusive transport through the chemocline density step must be very low, i.e., close to the molecular level. The observed seasonal variability of the chemocline depth can be considered as the result of a virtually steady inflow of groundwater, which supports the growth of the monimolimnion, and strong seasonal mixing in the mixolimnion, which acts against the stratification and erodes the monimolimnion. Over longer time scales, the chemocline is to be found at the level where erosive processes balance the recharging of the monimolimnion from groundwater. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of habitat use among vegetation-dwelling littoral fishes in the Atchafalaya River Basin, Louisiana	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Information regarding the relative value of different aquatic macrophytes as fish habitat is lacking for large floodplain river systems, such as the Atchafalaya River basin in south-central Louisiana. We made seasonal comparisons of fish (total length, <100 mm) density, diversity, and biomass and physicochemistry among submersed hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata, emergent bulltongue Sagittaria lancifolia, and floating water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes. In addition, we examined the influence of habitat structure and physicochemistry on fish assemblage composition and density. Although there were no seasonal differences in fish biomass among plant types, hydrilla consistently supported the greatest fish density and diversity across seasons. While hydrilla and water hyacinth fish density changed little among seasons, density in bulltongue was higher during tow water. Of the 12 most common fish species, the pirate perch Aphredoderus sayanus and yellow bullhead Ameiurus natalis showed no consistent pattern of habitat use. However, the densities of golden topminnow Fundulus chrysotus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, warmouth L. gulosus, redear sunfish L. microlophus, and pugnose minnow Opsopoeodus emiliae were highest in hydrilla, whereas the density of bantam sunfish L. symmetricus was highest in water hyacinth. A seasonally variable pattern was found for western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, redspotted sunfish L. miniatus, sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna (higher in bulltongue), and least killifish Heterandria formosa (lower in water hyacinth). Overall, littoral fish distributions reflected responses to several spatially and temporally variable environmental factors (e.g., water quality, plant complexity, and seasonal depth changes). We suggest that the consistently high fish density and diversity in hydrilla across seasons were related to an optimization of favorable water quality (particularly dissolved oxygen [DO]), architectural complexity, and biovolume. However, during low water, as hydrilla and water hyacinth canopies became very dense and water hyacinth DO levels remained low, bulltongue was more heavily used by several species, presumably because of a more favorable combination of DO, complexity, and particularly depth.																			0002-8487					JUL	2007	136	4					1063	1075		10.1577/T06-118.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-118.1													WOS:000248203500018

CREATING SYNERGIES BETWEEN CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE AND CATTLE PRODUCTION IN CROP-LIVESTOCK FARMS: A STUDY CASE IN THE LAKE ALAOTRA REGION OF MADAGASCAR	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted as a strategy to cope with deterioration in soil fertility, but its adoption on smallholder farms in tropical areas remains limited. In Madagascar, livestock production is facing shortages in forage especially during the dry season. The value of cover crops used in CA as livestock feed could be an incentive to make this form of agriculture more acceptable in rural areas. To do so, farmers must find a trade-off between the use of biomass from cover crops for animal production and its maintenance on the soil to meet CA's criteria. In this study, we evaluated the impact of biomass flows (cover crops and manure) between cropping and cattle production in crop-livestock farms in the Lake Alaotra region. Surveys among crop-livestock farmers were used to calculate feed concentrate and mineral fertilizer equivalents. Our results show that on average 42, 22 and 10% of biomass production (dry matter basis) of Brachiaria spp., Stylosanthes guianensis and Vicia villosa, respectively, are used for livestock feeding. The economic benefit in feed concentrate equivalent is between (sic)73 and (sic)723/year per farm. The use of manure contributes, just as CA, to improve soil fertility without using external fertilizing resources. The economic benefit in mineral fertilizer equivalent is between (sic)116 and (sic)2365/year per farm. The integration of CA and livestock production shows, beyond the agronomic advantages, an obvious economic benefit, which is essential to secure the Malagasy agricultural systems. Moreover, this economic benefit is another argument for the dissemination of CA practices in rural areas.					; Penot, Eric/AAY-8587-2020; Naudin, Krishna/G-3119-2010	Andriamandroso, Andriamasinoro Lalaina Herinaina/0000-0002-3786-7738; Naudin, Krishna/0000-0002-9108-2456													0014-4797	1469-4441				JUL	2013	49	3					352	365		10.1017/S0014479713000112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479713000112													WOS:000319702100003

This marine lake features regular seasonal anoxic conditions in the deepest part (the Western Trough). Building on previous studies of the effects of the oxycline on demersal fauna, a ROV was used to film the benthic assemblage. Transects above, within and below oxycline depth were filmed on each sampling occasion. Animals were identified and their sizes measured. Data on oxygen concentration of the water column were taken monthly during this period to correlate with the presence and absence of animals in the Trough. Most noteworthy was the establishment of a demersal fish assemblage during normoxic conditions in the deeper areas of the Trough. The goby Lesueurigobius friesii was the most abundant species and their population contained all size classes. They are territorial and build burrows into which they retreated when the ROV approached. The main factor influencing benthic fauna below oxycline depth was oxygen concentration, while the assemblage above the oxycline was never affected by hypoxia. This study shows that mobile animals make use of areas affected by hypoxia as soon as conditions improve, and can establish resident communities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The data indicated that R. tagatzi is a neritic tintinnid ciliate, which has been reported, to date, only from the Northern Hemisphere at tropical to warm-temperate latitudes. It has most often been detected in estuaries or lagoons characterized by a high trophic level and stable water column, and typically in the seasonal periods of highest abundance of small-sized phytoplankton. The biogeographic pattern emerging from this study, along with the prevalence of this species in ports and in transition environments exploited for bivalve culture, confirms the former assumption of an invasive behaviour of R. tagatzi, and suggests aquaculture transplants as a possible means of dispersion for ciliated protozoa.

While being members of a single species with the same ecological requirements, multiple asexual genotypes within a species are often found in a single habitat. Niche partitioning in time and space among genotypes has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. However, it is not clear whether these different genotypes co-occur in the long term. Therefore, we examined the population dynamics of two asexual Daphnia cf. pulex genotypes (JPN1 and JPN2) over 9 years in a small mountain lake. These two genotypes consistently occurred in the same seasons and layers, suggesting that niche partitioning cannot explain their long-term co-occurrence. The abundance of JPN1 was typically higher in most years. However, the abundance of dormant eggs in lake sediments was at the same level between the genotypes. Results of a laboratory experiment showed that JPN1 competitively excluded JPN2. However, many JPN2 individuals produced dormant eggs before JPN1 competitively excluded them from the experiment. Furthermore, the competitively inferior JPN2 produced dormant eggs abundantly in the medium containing a crowding cue from JPN1 while no such trend was observed for JPN1. These results showed that a competitively inferior asexual genotype could maintain a population with a competitively superior genotype for a long period of time because it had the ability to detect an increase in competitors and produce dormant eggs each year before being competitively eliminated. Based on these results, we suggest that the variation in genotype-specific response in dormant egg production to environmental change plays a key role in the long-term co-occurrence of different asexual genotypes in single habitats.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

The effect of seasonal flooding and livelihood activities on retention of nitrogen and phosphorus in Cyperus papyrus wetlands, the role of aboveground biomass	HYDROBIOLOGIA												With growing demand for food production in Africa, protecting wetlands and combining increased agricultural production with conservation of the ecological integrity of wetlands is urgent. The role of aboveground biomass of papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) in the storage and retention of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) was studied in two wetland sites in East Africa under seasonally and permanently flooded conditions. Nyando wetland (Kenya) was under anthropogenic disturbance from agriculture and vegetation harvesting, whereas Mara wetland (Tanzania) was less disturbed. Maximum papyrus culm growth was described well by a logistic model (regressions for culm length with R-2 from 0.70 to 0.99), with culms growing faster but not taller in Nyando than in Mara. Maximum culm length was greater in permanently than in seasonally flooded zones. Total aboveground biomass was higher in Mara than in Nyando. The amounts of N and P stored were higher in Mara than in Nyando. In disturbed sites, papyrus plants show characteristics of r-selected species leading to faster growth but lower biomass and nutrient storage. These findings help to optimize management of nutrient retention in natural and constructed wetlands.

The hydrology of the Jezero crater paleolake: Implications for the climate and limnology of the lake system from hydrological modeling	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Jezero crater, the landing site of the Perseverance rover, hosts sedimentary fan deposits, aqueously altered sedimentary rock, and an outlet breach of the crater rim, all of which indicates that a long-lived lake (or lakes) once existed within the crater. The deltaic deposits in the crater may preserve evidence of habitable conditions within the past lake system, which would have been influenced by the climate and conditions of the past hydrological system within the watersheds and basin. However, the aqueously altered sedimentary deposits within Jezero are less extensive than those found in other crater lakes on Mars, like Gale with a crater filling mound of cemented sediment. In this work we use hydrological models of the past Jezero lake system to constrain the climatic and hydrological conditions by comparing model predictions to the proposed lake stands and mineralogy in the crater observed from orbit and by the Perseverance rover thus far. We then compare these results to Gale crater to understand the influence of basin hydrology on the depositional setting found within past crater lakes. We show that a lake forming at the outlet breach elevation or higher in Jezero requires a semiarid or wetter-arid climate, consistent with previous estimates. An integrated hydrologic system with seasonal variations similar to arid and semiarid climates on Earth results in a lake system at Jezero characterized by both surface and subsurface outflow from the lake. Outflow to the subsurface and through the outlet breach will remove dissolved solids from the lake system, mitigating large-scale evaporite cementation within the Jezero basin, which is in contrast to Gale crater, where subsurface inflow constituted a larger percentage of the total inflow to the lake and all loss was through evaporation due to the setting in a deeper impact crater. Furthermore, at hyperarid climatic and/or groundwater-driven hydrological conditions, lake formation within Jezero would have ceased while a lacustrine depositional environment would have continued at Gale. This highlights the importance of considering basin hydrology, in addition to climate, when interpreting lacustrine sedimentary deposits in craters on Mars.																			0012-821X	1385-013X				JUN 1	2024	635								118690	10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118690		APR 2024											WOS:001223621800001

To better understand rusty crayfish life-history on these unique habitats, we conducted monitoring in 2012 and 2013 at four locations previously identified as spawning areas for native fish. With the aid of a graphical causal model, we conducted an exploratory statistical analysis using a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach with model selection based on information criteria to identify important environmental variables for predicting rusty crayfish distribution and abundance on spawning reefs. We also compared seasonal trends in relative abundance, inferred from catch-per-unit-effort calculations from trapping, to previously reported accounts from a smaller inland lake. The results from our modeling provide evidence of size-class segregation across subtle changes in habitat characteristics of spawning reefs. Specifically, we found evidence that the distribution of >30 mm rusty crayfish was only weakly related to rock density (#/m2) relative to juveniles and smaller size classes. We also observed highest relative abundances from minnow trap monitoring in mid-October when water temperatures averaged 13.9 degrees C, which is later in the year and at cooler temperatures than similar monitoring from smaller inland lakes has reported. We hypothesize that unique environmental conditions elicit novel life-history responses from rusty crayfish on Lake Michigan spawning reefs and discuss our findings in the context of native fish restoration in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

We studied the taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of catfish assemblages in one lotic and one lentic habitat of a segment of this floodplain during one hydrological cycle, from August 2014 to August 2015, comprising six samplings using gillnets, and identified the relationships between catfish traits and the environment based on five limnological variables. The functional structure was studied through 11 morphological measures and the species diets. We identified 31 catfish species and nine trophic groups. There were significant differences in species composition and diversity between habitats and months, but the functional structure of the catfishes was only determined by the temporal variability. The functional structure of the catfish assemblages was ordered by morphological traits related to locomotion, habitat use, and trophic ecology and these traits were correlated with the limnological variables, supporting the existence of environmental filters. Integrating the taxonomic and functional perspectives can provide a more complete picture of the ecological patterns of freshwater fish assemblages in the Neotropics and can help us predict how these assemblages might change in response to anthropogenic alterations of the environment.

J	Fouzari, A; Samraoui, F; Samraoui, B				Fouzari, Aicha; Samraoui, Farrah; Samraoui, Boudjema			The breeding ecology of Mallard Anas platyrhynchos at Lake Tonga, north-eastern Algeria	OSTRICH												The breeding ecology of Mallard Anas platyrhynchos was investigated at Lake Tonga, north-eastern Algeria, which is at the southern edge of the specie's range in the Western Palearctic. Breeding was mainly carried out in stumps of alder carr (Alnus glutinosa) that border the northern limit of the lake. The breeding season was relatively short, spanning two months. Laying occurred mainly in April but continued until end of May. The average clutch size was 8.4 +/- 1.9 eggs (N = 19 clutches) with 10 eggs being the modal clutch. The overall nesting success was 54% (N = 29 clutches), whereas predation accounted for most nest failure (76%). As often happens in arid climates and instable habitats, breeding outcome was significantly and negatively related to egg-laying date with precocious nests conferring better survival to eggs. In contrast, nest predation was positively associated with a deferred laying date. Seven cases of interspecific brood parasitism were recorded, all involving the Mallard and the Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca, with both species acting as either a host or a parasite. Nests in dense vegetation were more likely to harbour this interspecific interaction.					; Samraoui, Farrah/E-6757-2011; FOUZARI, Aicha/NYS-8825-2025; Samraoui, Boudjéma/E-6761-2011	Samraoui, Boudjema/0000-0002-0608-9021; Samraoui, Farrah/0000-0003-2407-3004													0030-6525	1727-947X					2018	89	4			SI		315	320		10.2989/00306525.2018.1443291	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2018.1443291													WOS:000454157800004

TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Habitat conditions may shape the abundance and community structure of planktonic fauna. In this study, we investigated whet her reservoirs with different locations and drainage basins also differed in the structure and abundance of zooplankton. The studies were conducted in 2010-2011 between June and October in the Vistula Lagoon and Lake Lebsko. The zooplankton was dominated mainly by small eurytopic organisms belonging to Rotifera. Plankton crustaceans showed a limited diversity of species. Copepods were predominant, while Cladoccra were observed sporadically in more freshwater habitats. In the first experimental season (2010), the Vistula Lagoon and Lake Lebsko showed a comparable taxonomic structure and an abundance of investigated zooplankton; a substantially higher density was recorded in Lake Lebsko in 2011, although the taxonomic diversity was higher in the Vistula Lagoon. Zooplankton biomass in a given season differed between these 2 water bodies, but not statistically significantly. The differences in location in the investigated water bodies impacted zooplankton assemblage structure and abundance. The drainage basin type (urbanized areas, forested areas, waterlogged areas) appeared to influence zooplankton species richness significantly.					; K, J/HJP-6006-2023	Paturej, Ewa/0000-0002-9459-9960; Koszalka, Jacek/0000-0003-3434-2036													1300-0179	1303-6114					2018	42	2					230	244		10.3906/zoo-1705-22	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-1705-22													WOS:000432550600008
