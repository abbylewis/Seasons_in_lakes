The boundaries of ecological islands are risky because of habitat loss and human-carnivore conflict. From snow track survey data collected over a 5-winter period we developed a population-level resource selection function for Canada lynx Lynx canadensis in Riding Mountain National Park, Canada. This park has been characterized as an 'ecological island situated amidst a sea of agricultural land' and while lynx are protected within the park, they are subject to harvest outside of the park. Winter resource selection of lynx increased with higher elevation and in highly suitable habitat for snowshoe hare Lepus americanus and decreased in habitat with greater proportions of agriculture and grasslands, both of which are common along the edge of the park. Habitat with medium to high relative probabilities of lynx occurrence tended to be distributed in the interior of the park. However, the highest relative probability of lynx occurrence was associated with habitat near the southeast border of the park in close proximity to a human community and a lake where snowmobiling, skiing, and snowshoeing are common recreational pursuits. We attribute this relationship to a 25-year old fire which presently created successional habitat highly suitable for snowshoe hare and correspondingly for lynx in this area. Our results suggest that Canada lynx occurrence tends to be associated with habitat that is highly suitable for their primary prey even if that habitat is located near to sources of human recreational activity.

Modern spaceborne radars can significantly extend the capabilities of the terrestrial hydrological network, since they enable one to perform measurements over large areas. In 2014, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the spaceborne dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). The main objective of the mission is the precipitation measurement. However, the radar cross section (RCS) measured at the maximal range contains information about the scattering surface. For the first time, DPR measurements over the Russian territory were processed. The sources of in situ data were hydrological stations. The Gorky reservoir and the Volga River were selected for sensing small-area inland waters. The data processing confirmed the possibility of detecting inland waters whose area is significantly smaller than the radar footprint. A ground-to-water ratio was introduced to estimate the open water area inside the footprint. Processing of the DPR data obtained for the Lake Baikal enabled us to calculate the dependence of the RCS on the incidence angle and propose a novel algorithm for separating open water and ice cover. The Moksha River was selected as a wetland with many small rivers. The data processing has shown that the spring change of inland waters and soil can be observed in the DPR image.

The molecular masses of the determined peptides range from 700 to 1100 Da. These results confirm the remarkable ability of cyanobacteria to synthesize a wide array of peptides.

In this study, interannual changes in food web structure were investigated in a lake-swamp-river system in the semi-arid West Siberian forest-steppe region using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15). The delta N-15 signatures of aquatic producers and consumers including zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish sharply increased (up to 7.2 parts per thousand in range) in 2009 under high summer precipitation. This would reflect the inflow of(15)N-rich nutrients accumulated in the catchment through natural and anthropogenic activities, e.g., sewage, livestock farming, evaporation, and/or microbial denitrification. In 2010, benthic producers including epiphytes and macrophytes were more(13)C-enriched, which is likely due to limited supply of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) under water stagnation, leading to a large isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis. However,C-13-enrichments in the benthic producers were not reflected to those of aquatic consumers in the habitat. Interannual changes in delta C-13 of particulate organic matter (POM; a proxy of phytoplankton) were reflected to those of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish fry, suggesting the trophic importance of autochthonous phytoplankton in the system. These findings suggest that occasional precipitation events in semi-arid forest-steppe regions can modify nutrient flux from the catchment, leading to changes in delta N-15 baseline in the lotic food web.

J	MCINERNY, MC				MCINERNY, MC			GAS-BUBBLE DISEASE IN 3 FISH SPECIES INHABITING THE HEATED DISCHARGE OF A STEAM-ELECTRIC STATION USING HYPOLIMNETIC COOLING WATER	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												White bass (Morone chrysops) bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) inhabiting the heated discharge canal of Duke Power Company''s Marshall Steam Station, Lake Norman, North Carolina, were examined for signs of gas-bubble disease (GBD) during the winters of 1982-1983 and 1983-1984. Peak percentages of these fish species with GBD occurred between late February and early May each year, corresponding with peaks in total gas saturation in the discharge water. Cooling and warming water temperatures, and thermal stratification of Lake Norman influenced saturation of dissolved gases in the hypolimnetic intake water of Marshall Steam Station, and directly affected the variability in total gas saturation in the discharge canal. Temperature change in the condenser cooling water and electricity output were unrelated to the within-year variability in total gas saturation and GBD. The use of hypolimnetic water for cooling at this station restricts the time to a few months that levels of total gas saturation are sufficient to induce GBD, but probably led to higher peaks in GBD than if epilimnetic water was used. Among years, levels of GBD in white bass, bluegill, and largemouth bass were higher when electrical demand and mean temperature changes of the condenser cooling water at Marshall Steam Station were higher. Higher incidences in GBD in these fishes also occurred during winters when intake water temperatures were coldest.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	1990	49	1-2					7	15		10.1007/BF00279506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00279506													WOS:A1990CT58400002
J	Adams, SB; Frissell, CA; Rieman, BE				Adams, SB; Frissell, CA; Rieman, BE			Geography of invasion in mountain streams: Consequences of headwater lake fish introductions	ECOSYSTEMS												The introduction of fish into high-elevation lakes can provide a geographic and demographic boost to their invasion of stream networks, thereby further endangering the native stream fauna. Increasingly, remaining populations of native salmonids are concentrated in fragmented headwater refugia that are protected by physical or biological barriers from introduced fishes that originate in the pervasive source populations established at lower elevations. Although fish introduced near mainstem rivers frequently encounter obstacles to upstream dispersal, such as steep slopes or falls, we found that brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) dispersed downstream through channel slopes of 80% and 18-m-high falls. Thus, headwater lake stocking provides source populations that may be capable of invading most downstream habitats, including headwater refugia of native fishes. The extent of additional area invasible from lakes, beyond that invasible from downstream, depends on the geography of the stream network, particularly the density and distribution of headwater lakes and their location relative to barriers inhibiting upstream dispersal. In the thermal and trophic environments downstream of lakes, fish commonly grow faster and thus mature earlier and have higher fecundity-at-age than their counterparts in other high-elevation streams. The resulting higher rates of population growth facilitate invasion. Larger body sizes also potentially aid the fish in overcoming barriers to invasion. Trout introductions to high-elevation headwater lakes thus pose disproportionately large risks to native fishes-even when the place of introduction may appear to be spatially dissociated from populations of the native species. Mapping the potential invasible area can help to establish priorities in stocking and eradication efforts.

The remote Antarctic region is home to a wealth of uncovered microbial diversity, some of which is associated with its megafauna, including penguin species, the dominant avian biota. Penguins interface with a number of other biota in their roles as marine mesopredators and several species overlap in their ranges and habitats. To characterize the circular single-stranded viruses related to those in the phylumCressdnaviricotafrom these environmental sentinel species, cloacal swabs (n= 95) were obtained from King Penguins in South Georgia, and congeneric Adelie Penguins, Chinstrap Penguins, and Gentoo Penguins across the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, abutting primers-based PCR recovery of circular genomic elements, cloning, and Sanger sequencing, we detected 97 novel sequences comprising 40 ssDNA viral genomes and 57 viral-like circular molecules from 45 individual penguins. We present their detection patterns, with Chinstrap Penguins harboring the highest number of new sequences. The novel Antarctic viruses identified appear to be host-specific, while one circular molecule was shared between sympatric Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins. We also report viral genotype sharing between three adult-chick pairs, one in each Pygoscelid species. Sequence similarity network approaches coupled with Maximum likelihood phylogenies of the clusters indicate the 40 novel viral genomes do not fall within any known viral families and likely fall within the recently established phylumCressdnaviricotabased on their replication-associated protein sequences. Similarly, 83 capsid protein sequences encoded by the viruses or viral-like circular molecules identified in this study do not cluster with any of those encoded by classified viral groups. Further research is warranted to expand knowledge of the Antarctic virome and would help elucidate the importance of viral-like molecules in vertebrate host evolution.					; Varsani, Arvind/JOZ-5299-2023	Djurhuus, Anni/0000-0002-3517-7522; Smith, Adrian/0000-0002-7657-6191; Levy, Hila/0000-0001-9204-6417; Varsani, Arvind/0000-0003-4111-2415; Hart, Tom/0000-0002-4527-5046; Salgado Fontenele, Rafaela/0000-0001-5638-7134; 														1999-4915				SEP	2020	12	9							1029	10.3390/v12091029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v12091029								32947826					WOS:000580222400001

Pollen-based continental climate reconstructions at 6 and 21 ka: a global synthesis	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Subfossil pollen and plant macrofossil data derived from C-14-dated sediment profiles can provide quantitative information on glacial and interglacial climates. The data allow climate variables related to growing-season warmth, winter cold, and plant-available moisture to be reconstructed. Continental-scale reconstructions have been made for the mid-Holocene (MH, around 6 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21 ka), allowing comparison with palaeoclimate simulations currently being carried out as part of the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The synthesis of the available MH and LGM climate reconstructions and their uncertainties, obtained using modern-analogue, regression and model-inversion techniques, is presented for four temperature variables and two moisture variables. Reconstructions of the same variables based on surface-pollen assemblages are shown to be accurate and unbiased. Reconstructed LGM and MH climate anomaly patterns are coherent, consistent between variables, and robust with respect to the choice of technique. They support a conceptual model of the controls of Late Quaternary climate change whereby the first-order effects of orbital variations and greenhouse forcing on the seasonal cycle of temperature are predictably modified by responses of the atmospheric circulation and surface energy balance.					; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Scholze, Marko/N-4573-2014; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; Brewer, Simon/0000-0002-6810-1911; Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Connor, Simon/0000-0001-5685-2390; Scholze, Marko/0000-0002-3474-5938; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				AUG	2011	37	3-4					775	802		10.1007/s00382-010-0904-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-010-0904-1													WOS:000293403500022

HABs are likely to increase in frequency and intensity due to rising summer temperatures caused by climate change and higher nutrient enrichment from increased urbanization. Policymakers need information on the economic costs of HABs to design optimal management policies in the face of limited budgets. Using a detailed, multi lake hedonic analysis across 6 Ohio counties between 2009 and 2015 we show capitalization losses associated with near lake homes between 11% and 17% rising to above 22% for lake adjacent homes. In the case of Grand Lake Saint Marys, we find one-time capitalization losses exceeding $51 million for near lake homes which dwarfs the State of Ohio's cleanup expenditure of $26 million.

A speciation method for arsenic species has been developed in which hidden arsenic was classified into two fractions by their lability to the photochemical degradation procedure: the ultraviolet-labile fraction and the ultraviolet-resistant fraction. The ultraviolet-labile fraction was the major fraction of hidden arsenic and comprised 15-45% and 4-26% of the total arsenic in Uranouchi Inlet and Lake Biwa (Japan), respectively. The highest concentration of the ultraviolet-resistant fraction was observed in Uranouchi Inlet during the summer, in which dimethylarsinic acid increased in the water column. We discuss the hidden arsenic fraction as the key to explaining arsenic speciation in natural waters. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The study area was Playa Colorada Bay, located in the northwest of Mexico, in the eastern part of the Gulf of California. In two seasons of the year, on-site and laboratory characterizations were carried out to determine the spatial and temporal variation of phosphates (PO4), electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and pH of water. Samplings were selected to match Landsat 8 satellite overpass in the study area. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the images, prior to the generation of the models. The models were generated using the linear regression technique of successive steps; water quality parameters and their logarithms were used as dependent variables, and as independent variables were used corrected reflectance values of Landsat images. The results showed that the concentration of PO4 in the analyzed water samples were higher than those recommended in the Mexican ecological criteria of water quality, to protect the aquatic life of marine water in coastal areas. In autumn, PO4 was correlated with turbidity, T, pH, and TSS. The highest correlation coefficients were presented by TSS with PO4 (r = - 0.979) and pH (r = 0.958). The water quality models that were generated had coefficients of determination (R (2)) in the range of 0.637 to 0.955 and show the viability of the application of Landsat 8 images in the characterization of water quality parameters in Playa Colorada Bay. Models allowed the estimation of the distribution of water quality parameters over the whole bay instead of only at the sampling stations, favoring a better understanding of their spatial distribution.

Asian Fish Tapeworm Bothriocephalus acheilognathi in the Desert Southwestern United States	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												The Asian fish tapeworm Bothriocephalus acheilognathi (Cestoda: Bothriocephalidea) is an introduced fish parasite in the southwestern United States and is often considered a serious threat to native desert fishes. Determining the geographic distribution of nonnative fish parasites is important for recovery efforts of native fishes. We examined 1,140 individuals belonging to nine fish species from southwestern U. S. streams and springs between January 2005 and April 2007. The Asian fish tapeworm was present in the Gila River, Salt River, Verde River, San Pedro River, Aravaipa Creek, and Fossil Creek, Arizona, and in Lake Tuendae at Zzyzx Springs and Afton Canyon of the Mojave River, California. Overall prevalence of the Asian fish tapeworm in Arizona fish populations was 19% (range = 0-100%) and varied by location, time, and fish species. In California, the prevalence, abundance, and intensity of the Asian fish tapeworm in Mohave tui chub Gila bicolor mohavensis were higher during warmer months than during cooler months. Three new definitive host species-Yaqui chub G. purpurea, headwater chub G. nigra, and longfin dace Agosia chrysogaster-were identified. Widespread occurrence of the Asian fish tapeworm in southwestern U. S. waters suggests that the lack of detection in other systems where nonnative fishes occur is due to a lack of effort as opposed to true absence of the parasite. To limit further spread of diseases to small, isolated systems, we recommend treatment for both endo- and exoparasites when management actions include translocation of fishes.					; Archdeacon, Thomas/JXL-2562-2024	Archdeacon, Thomas/0000-0002-6261-1849; 													0899-7659					DEC	2010	22	4					274	279		10.1577/H09-009.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/H09-009.1								21413512					WOS:000285991400009
J	Bahati, G; Pang, ZH; Armannsson, H; Isabirye, EM; Kato, V				Bahati, G; Pang, ZH; Armannsson, H; Isabirye, EM; Kato, V			Hydrology and reservoir characteristics of three geothermal systems in western Uganda	GEOTHERMICS												Several sampling surveys have been carried out in three geothermal areas in western Uganda, known as Katwe-Kikorongo (Katwe), Buranga, and Kibiro. Sixty-three water samples from hot and cold springs, dug wells, rivers, and lakes, and 14 rock samples from Surface outcrops have been collected and analyzed. They were then analyzed for chemistry and isotopes of hydrogen (delta(2)-H-H2O, H-3(H2O)), oxygen delta O-18(H2O), O-18(SO4),) carbon (delta C-13(DIC), C-14(DIC). sulfur (delta S-34(SO4)), and strontium (Sr-87/86(H2O), Sr-87/86(Rock)). The results suggest a meteoric origin for the geothermal waters, with little secondary alteration. Based on isotope data, Katwe and Buranga are recharged from the Rwenzori Mountains, and Kibiro from high ground represented by the Mukihani-Waisembe Ridge in Kitoba Sub-county, 20km to the southeast. Oxygen isotope geothermometry, based on aqueous sulfate and water equilibrium fractionation, indicates a subsurface temperature of 200 C for Buranga, which is higher than that inferred from chemical geothermometry (160-170 C). and lower temperatures (140-150 degrees C) for Katwe and Kibiro that are similar to the results of chemical geothermometry. Tritium concentrations indicate some involvement of modern cold water close to the surface at Kibiro but not at Buranga and Katwe, where hot springs discharge tritium-free waters. Sulfur isotope ratios (delta S-34(SO4)) of hot water suggest magmatic contributions of sulfate in all three areas, confirming the results of earlier geochernical investigations.

Influence of recent climatic events on the surface water storage of the Tonle Sap Lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lakes and reservoirs have been identified as sentinels of climate change. Tonle Sap is the largest lake in both the Mekong Basin and Southeast Asia and because of the importance of its ecosystem, it is has been described as the "heart of the lower Mekong". Its seasonal cycle depends on the annual flood pulse governed by the flow of the Mekong River. This study provides an impact analysis of recent climatic events from El Nino 1997/1998 to El Nino 2015/2016 on surface storage variations in the Tonle Sap watershed determined by combining remotely sensed observations, multispectral images and radar altimetry from 1993 to 2017. The Lake's surface water volume variations are highly correlated with rainy season rainfall in the whole Mekong River Basin (R = 0.84) at interannual time-scale. Extreme droughts and floods can be observed when precipitation deficit and excess is recorded in both the Tonle Sap watershed and the Mekong River Basin during moderate to very strong El Nino/La Nina events (R = -0.70) enhanced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (R = -0.68). Indian and Western North Pacific Monsoons were identified as having almost equal influence. Below normal vegetation activity was observed during the first semester of 2016 due to the extreme drought in 2015. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Are tropical cyclones possible over Titan's polar seas?	ICARUS												While extratropical cyclones cannot be expected in Titan's barotropic troposphere, tropical cyclones which gain their energy from the latent heat of sea evaporation cannot be entirely dismissed over Titan's polar hydrocarbon seas. The most essential condition for the genesis of tropical cyclones on Titan is a methane-rich composition of the polar seas. The most likely season for Titan's hypothetical tropical cyclones is around the northern summer solstice when the sea surface gets warmer and the relative vorticity of the near-surface air increases by seasonal convergence and equatorial wave activity. A tropical cyclone would manifest itself as an anti-clockwise swirling vortex right over one of the northern seas (Kraken Mare, Ligeia Mare, Punga Mare) and increase the surface wind over the seas by an order of magnitude. On the other hand, tropical cyclones are unlikely to emerge over Titan's few tropical lakes for dynamic reasons such as negligible Coriolis parameter and large vertical wind shear.

However, the accumulation of supersaturated methane in fully oxygenated water columns is commonly observed in many lakes, and factors responsible for the formation of the subsurface methane maximum (SMM) remain largely unknown. The present study conducted in 14 Japanese freshwater lakes showed that the SMM formation during the summer stratification period is a common feature in large and deep oligotrophic lakes. The seasonal survey of a deep oligotrophic lake revealed that SMM formation may be uncoupled with the dissolution of atmospheric methane, as well as with the transport of methane from tributary rivers, littoral sediments, and hypolimnetic anoxic sources, suggesting the contribution of in situ methane production. In fact, batch-culture experiments confirmed that bacterioplankton present in lake subsurface waters produce methane aerobically through the decomposition of methylphosphonic acid. Moreover, the development of SMM was closely associated with the seasonal dynamics of planktonic cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus, which may carry the enzyme to catabolize organophosphonate compounds. Therefore, we suggest that the predominance of Synechococcus during the thermal stratification period plays a significant role in SMM formation, and likely the methane flux from lakes to the atmosphere.

Geophagy of Wild Forest Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus valentinae, Flerov, 1933) in Yakutia	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The results of a study of salt licking features in wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus valentinae) using camera traps on two natural salt licks in Southern and Central Yakutia in 2015-2018 are presented. In Southern Yakutia, the highest number of visits to salt licks was recorded in autumn in September-October and occurred mostly in the morning and afternoon, while in Central Yakutia, salt licking activity was higher in June closer to evening and at dawn. The average number of visits per day by animals was 2.3 in Southern Yakutia and 1.4 in Central Yakutia. The duration of salt licking in wild reindeer in Southern Yakutia averaged 4.7 +/- 1.0 min, and in Central Yakutia, 3.1 +/- 0.4 min. In the snowy season, reindeer licking ice formed on salt licks, as well as gnawing on exposed areas of coastal soil and ice on alas lakes, were observed. The sex and age structure of wild reindeer visiting natural salt licks was as follows: males, 25.6%; females, 74.4%; calves, 17.3%. In Southern Yakutia, females with calves accounted for 20.0% of all visits, in Central Yakutia, 13.6%.

J	Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ				Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ			Climate effects on sulphate flux from forested catchments in south-central Ontario	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Net export of sulphate from watersheds may delay the response of surface waters to changes in acid deposition. Long-term (18-yr) sulphate budgets were calculated for 8 headwater streams located in the acid-sensitive region of Muskoka-Haliburton, south central Ontario. Sulphate deposition in this region has decreased by almost 40% over the last 2 decades, and sulphate export from catchments has also generally declined over time, but most catchments are still a net source of sulphate to drainage streams. Net export of sulphate occurred in the majority of catchments in most years of record, but was particularly large following dry, warmer than average summers, when stream flow ceased for up to several weeks at a time. In years with warm dry summers, such as occurred in 1983/84 and between 1987/88 and 1990/91, inclusive, stream export from most catchments was between 1.5 and 2 times greater than was input via bulk deposition. Annual average sulphate concentrations in streams were strongly correlated with stream dryness, and were greater in years in which streams were dry for longer periods of time. Temporal patterns of annual sulphate concentrations and export were highly coherent among the 8 streams, and net sulphate export occurred in both wetland-draining and predominantly upland streams. Climate variables, specifically temperature and precipitation act on a regional scale and are likely responsible for similar temporal patterns of sulphate retention among these 8 physiographically different catchments. Net sulphate export from catchments may delay the recovery of acid impacted surface waters, despite reductions in industrial SO2 emissions.

J	Woodland, RJ; Cook, PLM				Woodland, Ryan J.; Cook, Perran L. M.			Using stable isotope ratios to estimate atmospheric nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria at the ecosystem scale	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Diazotrophic cyanobacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric N-2 to satisfy their physiological nitrogen requirements. This process can result in the transfer of substantial amounts of new diazotrophic nitrogen (N-D) to aquatic ecosystems during blooms of these taxa. Using in situ measurements of plankton natural abundance stable isotope composition and a combination of underway and fixed site survey data, the total N-D flux into the Gippsland Lakes estuary (Australia) was estimated during a summer bloom of the diazotrophic cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. Over the course of the bloom, N-D increased in the upper water column of the estuary from 33% +/- 17% (mean +/- SD) to 73% +/- 13% of the standing pool of total particulate N. A conservative estimate of total N-D flux (146 Mg) equates to an estimated 177% of the summer total N load and 22% of the annual total N load to the estuary. Combining natural abundance stable isotope measurements with relatively simple fixed and underway survey designs can provide a cost-effective approach for monitoring the N-D flux into estuary or lacustrine environments. This approach relies on an isotopic differential between the diazotrophic and the non-diazotrophic components of the plankton community; it may not be appropriate in ecosystems that experience low-level blooms or blooms of intermittent N-fixing cyanobacteria. Large-scale blooms of diazotrophic cyanobacteria are considered uncommon in estuaries, yet it is clear that these blooms can represent major sources of new N to estuarine ecosystems when and where they occur.

VEGETATION HISTORY IN THE LAKE ILCHIR BASIN (EAST SAYAN MOUNTAINS) FOR THE LAST 8500 YEARS	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												Holocene climate is more complex both temporally and spatially than is commonly recognized. Pollen records from inland regions are important for understanding past changes in landscapes, assessing the sensitivity of ecosystems to future climatic variations that affect the composition of vegetation and its change over time. High-mountain boreal ecosystems are very vulnerable to climate change, and even minor fluctuations in it can lead to serious natural changes. We carried out analysis of pollen, spores, micro-charcoal particles, conifer stomata, and lithology of an AMS C-14-dated core from high-mountain Lake Ilchir situated in the Eastern Sayan mountains, in order to reveal changes in vegetation and climate since 8490 cal yr BP. The sediments of 133 cm long core consists of gray silty clay and shows no signs of sedimentary hiatuses. Fife bulk sediment samples were dated with an accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system. The modern vegetation of the Lake Ilchir basin is ranges from moist forb-grass meadow around the lake to small patches of open larch stands and shrubby birch on the basin slopes. The pollen record presented here is the first continuous and well-dated records from Lake Ilchir covering the last 8490 cal years, allowing detailed reconstruction of vegetation and environmental dynamics in the region. The results of the pollen analysis and pollen-based vegetation and climate reconstruction suggest that grass-dominated meadow communities prevailed in the lake basin from 8490 to 6000 kyr BP. The absence of larch and fir stomata in the sediments suggests the growth of trees rather far from the Lake shore. Probably, the climate in the basin was moderately cold with insufficient moisture. The high Scots pine pollen percentage in comparison with surface pollen spectra suggests a higher than today position of the upper boundary of the pine in response of higher-than-present summer insolation. Between 6000-3700 kyr BP the climate was characterized by warmer than modern winter seasons and high snow cover, which did not allow the soils to freeze and supported the development of fir in the Ilchir Lake basin. However, the increased abundance of larch pollen and stomatal cells of its needles in sediments suggest an increased role of larch in the composition of local vegetation and / or its approach to the lake shoreline. Expansion of the areas of larch means that climate gradually became sharply continental, more arid. The last 3700 years was characterized by a continuing increase in climate continentality and cooling that led to the complete disappearance of fir and appearance of spruce in the lake catchment. The more detailed temporal resolution of future palaeoecological records from this region will improve our understanding of the interaction of the lakes hydrology with climate and will provide valuable information for the efficient use of water resources.

This deep Italian basin is characterized by the presence of a large island, imparting attributes of an annulus to the lake. During the summer of 2010, the internal wave activity was dominated by a basin-scale internal wave of vertical and horizontal modes 1 (V1H1), superimposed on which were occasional higher vertical modes (V2H1) and higher horizontal modes (V1H5) trapped by the main island. The occurrence of these motions was interpreted as forcing by the wind components with similar horizontal structures and with energies at frequencies near the natural oscillations of the excited modes. The modifications of the wind field by the topography, in particular, controlled the excitation of an anticyclonic wave trapped around the island, whose features were investigated on the basis of an extension of the circular model to the case of an annular basin of constant depth.

Their sedimentary archives can therefore provide insights in the past magnitude and frequency of local mountain hazards, which is key for reliable hazard assessment and understanding of mountain landscape evolution. Here we present morphological, seismic-reflection and sedimentary data from Lake Altaussee, a groundwater-fed lake surrounded by steep topography in the Eastern Alps (Austria). The slow organic-rich sedimentation is interrupted by one phase of inflow (by the Augstbach creek), resulting in clastic sediment input between similar to 1110-1346 cal yr CE. This inflow phase was terminated by an artificial diversion of the creek as documented in historical reports. The combination of large blocks (max. 70 m in diameter), a mass-flow deposit and megaturbidite deposited on deformed basin floor sediments points to multiple terrestrial mass movements with a total volume of similar to 430,000 m(3) that propagated into the lake and which occurred 755-991 cal yr CE. A 3D hydrodynamic model suggests that the potential mass movement at the northern shore induced an impact wave that inundated the western shoreline with flow depth of up to 9 m and reaching up to ca. 210 m inland. Calculated speed of the backflow indicates that coarse shore sediments can be transported into the lake, which can explain the abundance of gravel/coarse sand at the base of the megaturbidite at the periphery of the basin. Moreover, such impact wave would lead to a standing lake water oscillation (seiching), which is further attested by regular lamination and oscillating grain-size parameters at the base of the main silty unit of the megaturbidite. A persistent change in sediment dynamics around a main subaqueous karst spring pit occurred at 165 cal yr BCE-222 cal yr CE when repeated sediment expulsions from the spring pit started to build up a crater rim. This onset of sediment expulsions is directly overlying a soft-sediment deformation structure (micro-faults). A good age correlation of the two major Altaussee events (i: multiple mass movements, ii: onset of sediment expulsions from spring pit) to large mass-transport deposits in the sedimentary record of the nearby Lake Hallstatt let us hypothesize that two large earthquakes took place in the Late Holocene that led to a multitude of morphological and sedimentary responses in the Upper Traun region. Our findings provide the first indication of an impact wave on a natural lake in the Eastern Alps, highlighting the potential for hazard cascades that remain undocumented in historical records, underscoring the need for reassessing natural hazard risks in alpine lake environments.

The results indicate that Holocene climate change at different altitudes is both consistent and different: a synchronous record of an increased warm-humid phase (10.0-8.5 ka) and a cold phase around 8.2 ka in the Early Holocene; an optimal warm-humid condition in marginal mountains of the Gonghe Basin in the Mid-Holocene; and a gradual decline in temperature and humidity in the Late Holocene. The Gonghe Basin interior in the Mid-Holocene was relatively arid, with increased moisture in the Late Holocene. On this basis, we compared our results to the paleoclimatic record in the low-latitude Asian monsoonal region, which indicates that, in addition to the Asian summer monsoonal strength having influenced regional climate change, the upward and subsidence motion of airflow over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau induced by topographic conditions, evaporation, and the feedback effect by the substrate was also influential. The latter was especially important for spatial-temporal differences in Middle and Late Holocene climatic changes at different altitudes.

We have gathered existing data on Greater Flamingos in Turkey and carried out field surveys to present the most up to date information on wintering (1999-2014) and breeding (1969- 2014). The wintering population of flamingos shows an increasing trend with 54,947 +/- 20,794 individuals mainly concentrated in the Gediz, Buyuk Menderes and Cukurova deltas, respectively. Breeding attempts were recorded in at least seven wetlands in Turkey in the past, yet after 1999 most of the colonies were abandoned due to basin scale intensive water management practices in Central Anatolia. Currently, only Tuz Lake and Gediz Delta are used as regular breeding sites, while breeding has been recorded sporadically in Acgol and Akehir Lakes. The breeding colony of Tuz Lake is of prime importance at the Mediterranean scale, with the number of young chicks in 2011, 2012 and 2013 accounting for the highest number of fledglings in the Mediterranean Region and West Africa (18,418, 20,274 and 20,292 respectively). Finally, building upon the previous findings about Turkey and the western Mediterranean metapopulation links, recent resightings of Turkish flamingos (despite the limited numbers) confirm post-fledging and natal dispersal reaching the western Mediterranean Basin and West Africa. Flamingos from Turkey were also found to disperse to Israel and to a region outside the known flyways of the western Mediterranean and West African flamingos (i.e. to Israel and UAE). Thus, Turkey, due to its geographic position, appears to be a crossroad between the western and eastern Mediterranean Region and southwest Asia.					; Ozbek, Melih/GXM-5275-2022; Özesmi, Uygar/HPC-1645-2023; Onmus, Ortac/I-4717-2015; Isfendiyaroglu, Süreyya/AAF-4369-2020; Béchet, Arnaud/AAA-4398-2021	Ozesmi, Uygar/0000-0002-4058-1116; Bechet, Arnaud/0000-0002-0330-6342; 													0939-7140	2326-2680				JUL 3	2015	61	3					201	214		10.1080/09397140.2015.1058452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2015.1058452													WOS:000366182900001

Two periods differing in external nutrient load and water level were compared by analysis of variance. The years 1985-1988 were characterized by the highest loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, high water level and cool summers. The years 2000-2003 were distinguished by low or medium water levels and warm summers. The first period showed statistically significantly higher values of total nitrogen (N-tot) and a higher N-tot:P-tot mass ratio. The second period showed a higher content of total phosphorus (P-tot), a higher ratio of dissolved inorganic compounds N to P and higher phytoplankton and cyanobacterial biomasses. Comparison between parts of the lake demonstrated that the differences between the two periods were more evident in the shallower and strongly eutrophic parts, Lake Pihkva and Lake Lammijarv, than in the largest and deepest part, the moderately eutrophic Lake Peipsi s.s. Temperature and water level acted synergistically and evidently influenced phytoplankton via nutrients, promoting internal loading when the water level was low and the temperature high. The effect of water level was stronger in the shallowest part, Lake Pihkva. The difference in P-tot content between the southern and northern parts was twofold; the N-tot:P-tot mass ratio was significantly lower in the southern parts, and phytoplankton biomass (particularly the biomass of cyanobacteria) was significantly higher for Lake Pihkva and Lake Lammijarv than for Lake Peipsi s.s.

However, data for the direct measurement of CO2 effluxes through field-scale waste-rock piles are lacking. This study investigated the influence of a short-term, multi-day (29 July to 5 August 2002) heavy rainfall event on waste-rock water conditions and CO2 effluxing from two large waste-rock piles at the Key Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan. The study also investigated spatial and temporal variation in CO2 effluxes in these waste-rock piles over a 2-year period (summer 2000 - summer 2002). Results showed that the impact of a heavy rainfall event on surface-water conditions and CO2 effluxes from these waste-rock piles is of relatively short duration. Results also showed that the CO2 effluxes were relatively uniform, both spatially and temporally (average covariance (CV) is 28%-39%), over the 2-year test period. This information can provide an important tool in the development of a long-term management plan for mine waste-rock piles.

PLUTONIUM ISOTOPES IN ECOSYSTEM OF A RUNNING SHALLOW LAKE	LITHUANIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												The aim of the present work is to get information on the possibilities of the shallow lake self-cleaning from plutonium isotopes using Lake Zuvintas as an object of study. A choice of the object is mainly related to the peculiarity of hydrology and hydrodynamics of Lake Zuvintas located in the southern part of Lithuania that was affected by radioactive fallouts after the nuclear events. During the period of study the bottom sediments of Lake Zuvintas behaved mainly as an accumulator of Pu isotopes. The main part of plutonium of the Chernobyl origin in surface sediments is present in exchangeable and potentially mobile physico-chemical forms. Processes of Pu migration are especially active during winter season when under anaerobic conditions the most important role in the Pu isotopes transfer belongs to reduced plutonium ions.

Dynamics of changes of individual parameters were analysed in the entire year. We stated that the scope of temperatures showed the cleanness of waters rivers in principle to the first class, however in summer, cleanness of waters is higher. Concentration of dissolved oxygen, generally it is high, which in the summer indicated purities of waters to the third class in chosen points. Conductivity and pH of water was very good. Values of BOD5 was high, which pointed on second or third class. Concentration of all compounds of nitrogen didn't exceed norms. However the concentration of orthophosphates and total phosphorus was relatively high and it qualified waters for the third class.

We present a novel method to quantitatively reconstruct past summer air temperatures based on fossil chydorid (Cladocera: Chydoridae) ephippia assemblages. We examined a 76-lake training set from Finland for chydorid ephippia distribution to develop a transfer function for summer air temperatures. Subsequently, we tested its usability in downcore reconstructions by inferring Holocene temperatures from Lake Arapisto in southern Finland. Significant climate-related variation was found in the distribution and abundance of chydorid ephippia in the training set. A transfer function for palaeotemperature reconstructions was developed using the partial least squares technique, which showed favourable performance statistics, enabling the test use of the model in a downcore reconstruction. The ephippia assemblages were responding to the Holocene climate development in the Lake Arapisto core. The ephippium-inferred temperatures correlated closely with the previously available independent palaeoclimate data from Lake Arapisto and from an adjacent lake, although the early Holocene samples had poor modern analogues in the training set. The use of fossil chydorid ephippia in palaeoclimatological reconstructions is a promising tool and it can contribute as a valuable addition for multiproxy assessments of past climate changes.

Larry			Nonlinear causal analysis reveals an effective water level regulation approach for phytoplankton blooms controlling in reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reservoirs are a rapidly increasing water body providing water supply, irrigation, and many other benefits for human societies globally. However, due to changes in hydrological conditions, building reservoirs tends to bring adverse effects such as eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms, reducing the ecosystem service values. This study focuses on using the empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), an emerging approach for nonlinear analysis, to investigate the nonlinear causal relationship of water level fluctuation (WLF) on phytoplankton biomass and then develop a quantitative model guiding effective phytoplankton blooms controlling based on water level regulations in reservoirs. Specifically, with 9-year continued daily observed data in the Three Gorges Reservoir, we examined the causal effects of different WLF parameters on the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms for the first time. We found that the water level change in the past 24 h (AWL) has the strongest causal effect on the daily dynamics of phytoplankton biomass among all WLF parameters (AWL, |AWL|, and the water level), with a time lag of 2 days. Moreover, EDM revealed a nonlinear relationship between AWL and daily dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and achieved a successful prediction for the chlorophyll a concentration 2-day ahead. Further scenario analyses found that both the rise and fall of water level will significantly reduce the chlorophyll a concentration when phytoplankton blooms occur. Nevertheless, on the whole, the rising water level has a more substantial effect on phytoplankton blooms than falling the water level. This result reveals that regulating AWL is a simple and effective approach in controlling phytoplankton blooms in reservoirs. Our study reported the nonlinear causal effect of AWL on the dynamics of chlorophyll a and provided a quantitative approach guiding effective phytoplankton blooms controlling based on the water level regulation, which might have a broad application in algal blooms controlling in reservoirs and similar waterbodies.

Results show that precipitation amounts decreased by 16.2 mm per decade, which was attributable to a significant reduction in precipitation frequency. Contrary wave trains were found in the subtropical westerly jet (wave guide) over Eurasia for the wet and dry years of North. China. When the wave trains had a ridge (trough) around the Korean Peninsula, conditions favored (disfavored) the westward and northward extension of the West Pacific subtropical high. The westward and northward extension of the West Pacific subtropical high is, and was, beneficial to rainfall in North China. The downstream propagation of Rossby waves was found to favor the maintenance of these wave trains. Sensible heating in the south of Lake Baikal and latent heating from the Korean Peninsula to the south of Japan increased during the period 1980-2007, as compared to that during 1957-1979, the wet period. These changes had positive influences on the maintenance of Anticyclonic-Cyclonic anomaly centers in the wave trains. Furthermore, northerly winds were prevalent in the lower troposphere during the dry period (1980-2007), which prohibited the transportation of water vapor to North China from the seas and thereby led to a decrease in rainfall in North China. The weakening of the Indian Monsoon during the dry period might be one of reasons for the reduction in water vapor transportation.

J	Trauth, N; Haupt, R				Trauth, Nico; Haupt, Ralf			Lowflow situations in Thuringia - Time series analysis of discharges at river gauges	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG												In the summer of 2018, an intense heat wave occurred in Central Europe followed by extreme low water level in rivers, lakes and ground-water bodies. In this study, the occurrence and the magnitude of low flow periods are evaluated by means of time series analysis of discharge measurements at river flow gauges of the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. The analysis includes 122 gauges evaluating the daily mean discharge measurements within monitoring periods from 1925 to 2018. The results show that low flow periods occurred in Thuringia during almost every decade. Specifically, during the year 2018 the low flow period was extremely long lasting and regionally equally distributed over all gauges (percentage mean deviation from MQ: 36.5 %, duration below the threshold value of long-term mean NM30Q: 169 days). However, with respect to low flow statistics the period during the year 1976 was not surpassed in the year 2018. Despite that fact, the low flow period during 2018 showed the most extreme reoccurrence period since 1959 (15.4 years), in consideration of the mean value of all gauges. Catchments at lower altitudes with little forest areas, small mean slopes and low precipitation are more affected by low flow periods. Mann-Kendall trend tests applied to annual mean discharges between 1978 and 2018 reveal that for 74.3 % of the gauges the discharges decrease significantly. For the mean discharge values during the summer months (April to September), a significant discharge decrease was observed for 85.1 % of the gauges.																			1439-1783					AUG	2022	66	4					178	188		10.5675/HyWa_2022.4_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.5675/HyWa_2022.4_1													WOS:000842030500002

The crabs were caught during the autumn of 1987 in freshwater lakes near Emden (Federal Republic of Germany). N6-2''-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3'':5''-cyclic monophosphate (db-cAMP), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 7.beta.-acetoxy-8,13-epoxy-1.alpha., 6.beta.,9.alpha.-trihydroxy-labd-14-ene-11-one (forskolin) induce an increase in the influx of both Na+ and Cl- in the gills. They also induce significant hyperpolarization. This last result indicates that the increase in NaCl uptake is related to an activation of both the Na+/K+ pump and the Cl- channels located at the serosal side of the gill epithelium. The possibility that cAMP acts as a second messenger, mediating the effects of different neuroendocrine factors involved in ionic and osmotic regulation in crustaceans is discussed.

While a number of studies have focused on the ozone-pollution-prone regions such as the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta regions, few studies have investigated the mechanisms modulating the interannual variability of ozone concentrations in Shandong Province, where a large population is located and is often subject to ozone pollution. By utilizing both the reanalysis dataset and regional numerical model (WRF-CMAQ), we delve into the potential governing mechanisms of ozone pollution in Shandong Province-especially over the major port city of Qingdao-during summer 2014-2019. During this period, ozone pollution in Qingdao exceeded the tier II standard of the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality (GB 3095-2012) for 75 days. From the perspective of meteorology, the high-pressure ridge over Baikal Lake and to its northeast, which leads to a relatively low humidity and sufficient sunlight, is the most critical weather system inducing high-ozone events in Qingdao. In terms of emissions, biogenic emissions contribute to ozone enhancement close to 10 ppb in the west and north of Shandong Province. Numerical experiments show that the local impact of biogenic emissions on ozone production in Shandong Province is relatively small, whereas biogenic emissions on the southern flank of Shandong Province enhance ozone production and further transport northeastward, resulting in an increase in ozone concentrations over Shandong Province. For the port city of Qingdao, ship emissions increase ozone concentrations when sea breezes (easterlies) prevail over Qingdao, with the 95th percentile reaching 8.7 ppb. The findings in this study have important implications for future ozone pollution in Shandong Province, as well as the northern and coastal areas in China.					; GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023; Cheng, Wenxuan/KHW-8223-2024; Wang, Yuhang/B-5578-2014	, Yuhang/0000-0002-7290-2551; Chen, Qing/0000-0002-4383-617X; 														1660-4601				JUN	2022	19	11							6758	10.3390/ijerph19116758	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116758								35682342					WOS:000808888200001
J	Faude, UC; Hofle, MG				Faude, UC; Hofle, MG			Development and application of monoclonal antibodies for in situ detection of indigenous bacterial strains in aquatic ecosystems	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Strain-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were developed for three different bacterial isolates obtained from a freshwater environment (Lake Plusssee) in the spring of 1990. The three isolates,,which were identified by molecular methods, were as follows: Cytophaga johnsonae PX62, Comamonas acidovorans PX54, and Aeromonas hydrophila PU7718. These strains represented three species that were detected in high abundance during a set of mesocosm experiments in Lake Plusssee by the direct analysis of low-molecular weight RNAs from bacterioplankton. We developed one MAB each for the bacterial isolates PX54 and PU7718 that did not show any cross-reactivity with other bacterial strains by immunofluorescence microscopy. Each MAb recognized the general lipopolysaccharide fraction of the homologous strain. These MAbs were tested successfully for their ability to be used for the in situ detection and counting of bacteria in lake water by immunofluorescence microscopy. During the spring of 1993, A. hydrophila PU7718 showed a depth distribution in Lake Plusssee with a pronounced maximum abundance at 6 m, whereas Comamonas acidovorans PX54 showed a depth distribution with a maximum abundance at the surface. The application of these;MAbs to the freshwater samples enabled us to determine the cell morphologies and microhabitats of these strains within their natural environment. The presence of as many as 8,000 cells of these strains per mi in their original habitats 3 years after their initial isolation demonstrated the persistence of individual strains of heterotrophic bacteria over long time spans in pelagic habitats.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				NOV	1997	63	11					4534	4542		10.1128/AEM.63.11.4534-4542.1997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.63.11.4534-4542.1997								9361440					WOS:A1997YE28100057

The surveys were conducted in Perry Lake in Kansas and showed that spring runoff laden with triazine herbicides entered the reservoir and did not mix immediately. Concentrations varied threefold between the inlet and the public water supply intakes located at the opposite end of the reservoir. The concentration range in the outflow varied much less than the concentration in the reservoir because of mixing throughout the season near the dam and outflow. A major conclusion from the study was that multiple analyses by a low-cost immunoassay technique coupled with computer visualization software gave a good three-dimensional view of the mass of herbicide present in a drinking water reservoir.					; Thurman, Earl/B-5131-2011	THURMAN, Earl Michael/0000-0002-2191-1407; 													0003-150X					NOV	2002	94	11					54	66																WOS:000179705500018
J	PLATT, T; BIRD, DF; SATHYENDRANATH, S				PLATT, T; BIRD, DF; SATHYENDRANATH, S			CRITICAL DEPTH AND MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCTION	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The concept of critical depth, as formulated by Sverdrup (J. Cons. perm. int. Explor. Mer. 18, 287 (1953)) to explain the onset of the spring bloom of phytoplankton, is discussed. Simplifying assumptions (use of a linear photosynthesis-light curve, use of daily averaged irradiance), adopted by Sverdrup in his computation of the growth term, are removed. An exact expression is found for the critical depth in terms of a generalized, biomass-specific, loss term. The loss term is calculated as the sum of contributions from algal respiration and excretion, grazing by micro- and macro-zooplankton, and sedimentation. Critical depth is then estimated using figures typical of the North Atlantic, and a sensitivity analysis is done. The respiratory costs of algal growth and metabolism dominate the generalized loss term. It is pointed out that the Sverdrup critical depth criterion is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the initiation of phytoplankton blooms. As a diagnostic tool, its value is therefore limited. It tells only whether net growth is possible: it tells nothing about how rapidly the phytoplankton will increase. But from the information used to calculate critical depth, it is possible to deduce the rate of increase in algal biomass (or, equivalently, the net production) for the mixed layer. As long as the growth rate is positive, the Sverdrup criterion is respected. This leads to a characteristic timescale for the development of a bloom. When the timescale is short relative to the time between mixing by storms, a bloom can be expected to occur.																			0962-8452	1471-2954				DEC 23	1991	246	1317					205	217		10.1098/rspb.1991.0146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1991.0146													WOS:A1991GX98500003

LAKE ISSAQUEENA	JOURNAL OF PROTOZOOLOGY												A quantitative study of the seasonal distribution of thermotolerant (37.degree. C and 45.degree. C), small free-living amoebae (FLA) was conducted in Lake Issaqueena, a warm, monomictic lake with steep, sloping banks and a maximum basin depth of 10 m in the Piedmont region of South Carolina [USA], Naegleria and Vahlkampfia were the most frequently encountered FLA in littoral sediment and surface water samples whereas Acanthamoeba was most commonly isolated from profundal sediment, especially during late summer. In the water column, FLA populations were highest in a persistent detrital layer; however, few amoebae were isolated from a massive (.apprx. 1.5 m thick) layer of Oscillatoria. The only N. fowleri isolated in this study was from the detrital layer. Discussion of the influence of differences in watershed and basin morphology on variations in the size and generic composition of FLA populations for the aquatic ecosystems of Lake Issaqueena and Willard''s Pond is included.

The DOC concentration was shown statistically to affect as the limiting factor differentialy on the bacterial growth rate in either the period while phytoplankton in the bog water was the major DOC source or another period while dead littoral vegetation in the bog sediment was responsible for supplying the DOC into the water column. Annual average of the growth rate of bacterioplankton was 0.083 hr-1, therewith the daily bacterial production was 24 .mu.gC/l/day on the annual average. Seasonal fluctuation of the bacterial growth rate was shown to be approxiamtely simulated by combining three environmental factors of the DOC concentration, the water temperture and the bacterial population density.																			0003-9136					FEB	1988	111	4					519	531																WOS:A1988M489000004

The results indicate that a valley glacier occupied the entire valley during the Last Glacial Maximum (before 21 970 +/- 620 cal. a BP). The glacier remained large throughout the early Lateglacial until a significant glacier retreat took place about 14 300 +/- 330 cal. a BP. Major advances occurred during the Older Dryas (OD) and during the Younger Dryas (YD), while minor advances are suggested to have taken place during the Intra Allerod Cold Period and the Late Allerod Cooling. Additionally, three smaller glacier retreats/re-advances within the YD are suggested to have taken place, the latter being the largest. The glacier re-formations/advances during the Lateglacial are consistent with increases in temperature, and they are thus suggested to be the result of increased winter precipitation. Comparing the results with relevant glacier and sea-surface temperature records, a south-north migration of storm tracks may have occurred between 12 100-11 810 +/- 220 cal. a BP. The high temporal resolution of local glacier activity in Finnkongdalen improves our understanding of the climate forcing of the regional glacier fluctuations of the northwestern sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Skarpnes- (OD) and Tromso-Lyngen (YD) re-advances.

J	Aguilar, P; Sommaruga, R				Aguilar, Pablo; Sommaruga, Ruben			The balance between deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring lake bacterioplankton community over time	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												One major goal in microbial ecology is to establish the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for community assembly. This is relevant to explain and predict how diversity changes at different temporal scales. However, understanding of the relative quantitative contribution of these processes and particularly of how they may change over time is limited. Here, we assessed the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes based on the analysis of the bacterial microbiome in one alpine oligotrophic and in one subalpine mesotrophic lake, which were sampled over two consecutive years at different time scales. We found that in both lakes, homogeneous selection (i.e., a deterministic process) was the main assembly process at the annual scale and explained 66.7% of the bacterial community turnover, despite differences in diversity and temporal variability patterns between ecosystems. However, in the alpine lake, homogenizing dispersal (i.e., a stochastic process) was the most important assembly process at the short-term (daily and weekly) sampling scale and explained 55% of the community turnover. Alpha diversity differed between lakes, and seasonal stability of the bacterial community was more evident in the oligotrophic lake than in the mesotrophic one. Our results demonstrate how important forces that govern temporal changes in bacterial communities act at different time scales. Overall, our study validates on a quantitative basis, the importance and dominance of deterministic processes in structuring bacterial communities in freshwater environments over long time scales.

Coarse grained sediments in association with higher percentages of wetland pollen (Cyperaceae) and upper conifer pollen (Tsuga and Pinus) in the lower part of the core indicate low lake levels and a relatively cold/dry climate between 3500 and 2030 cal BP, reflecting a decline of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Muddy sediments coupled with reduction of wetland pollen represent the rise of lake levels, implying the re-strengthening of the EASM during the past 2000 years. Paleotemperature was inferred from the variation of pollen origin from the upper and lower mountain forest, indicating the global temperature anomalies of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). In comparison to the main climate forces in the North Pacific, we suggest that the long-term climatic trend in Taiwan was controlled by variations in EASM intensity, while increased precipitation over the past 2000 years may also be linked to warmer sea surface temperature (SST) of the western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and increased El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which increased typhoon intensity. Higher diatom-inferred pH during 2930-2030 cal BP and the LIA suggest strong hydrological disturbances, reflecting more typhoons passing over Taiwan. The frequent typhoon events could be linked by an abrupt shift of typhoon track, due to the reduction of the WPWP and expansion of the Northwestern Pacific High, which move typhoons in a more westerly direction.

The reconstruction shows a significant downward trend in the frequency of large fires from 0.0061 fire.yr(-1) ca. 5000 cal yr BP to 0.0033 fire.yr(-1) at present. Simulations of fire-season climate based on UK Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Programme output and reconstructions based on proxy data both indicate a shift toward increasing available moisture in the region between the mid-Holocene and today. We infer that the diminishing trend in wildfire activity was ultimately caused by the steady orbitally driven reduction in summer insolation. Future higher temperatures not compensated for by significant precipitation increases will bring fire frequency back toward its upper limit, recorded between 6000 and 2000 cal yr BP.

W.; Trouet, Valerie			Drivers of California's changing wildfires: a state-of-the-knowledge synthesis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Over the past four decades, annual area burned has increased significantly in California and across the western USA. This trend reflects a confluence of intersecting factors that affect wildfire regimes. It is correlated with increasing temperatures and atmospheric vapour pressure deficit. Anthropogenic climate change is the driver behind much of this change, in addition to influencing other climate-related factors, such as compression of the winter wet season. These climatic trends and associated increases in fire activity are projected to continue into the future. Additionally, factors related to the suppression of the Indigenous use of fire, aggressive fire suppression and, in some cases, changes in logging practices or fuel management intensity, collectively have produced large build-ups of vegetative fuels in some ecosystems. Human activities provide the most common ignition source for California's wildfires. Despite its human toll, fire provides a range of ecological benefits to many California ecosystems. Given the diversity of vegetation types and fire regimes found in the state, addressing California's wildfire challenges will require multi-faceted and locally targeted responses in terms of fuel management, human-caused ignitions, building regulations and restrictions, integrative urban and ecosystem planning, and collaboration with Tribes to support the reinvigoration of traditional burning regimes.

Algae characteristic of Lake Matheson (12 m deep) were flagellates (Synura, Cryptomonas, Vacuolaria), Closterium aciculare, Gymnozyga moniliformis and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Differences between phytoplankton in 1933 and 1965-1975 reflect the different seasons when samples were collected rather than changes in the trophic level of the water.

Here, we tested a new monitoring tool that uses environmental DNA (eDNA), an assemblage of DNA in environmental water, to specifically detect Japanese native and introduced non-native genotypes of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Lake Biwa, Japan, and estimated differences between the two genotypes in the use of inland habitats. We monitored the ratios of native and non-native single nucleotide polymorphism alleles of a mitochondrial locus of common carp in a lagoon connected to Lake Biwa for 3years using eDNA. We observed seasonal dynamics in the allele frequency showing that the native genotype frequency peaked every spring, suggesting that native individuals migrated to the lagoon for spawning and then returned to the main lake, whereas non-native individuals tended to stay in the lagoon. The estimated migration patterns corresponded with the estimates of a previous study, which were based on commercial fish catch data. Our findings suggest that eDNA-based monitoring can be useful tool for addressing intraspecific behavioral differences underwater.

Oocyte atresia started during vitellogenesis in autumn, and was often followed by asynchronous egg cell development. Among other anomalies, multi-nucleus oocytes and hermaphroditism were observed. No significant impact was seen in silver bream Blicca bjoerkna. Ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus reacted by a tendency to produce an additional mature oocyte generation during the spawning period. Ovaries in roach from coastal areas were often infected by a microsporidian parasite Pleistophora mirandellae, causing severe damage to the gonad. Parasites were also detected in pike, but neither in perch nor in lake populations of roach. Fish living in open coastal environments did not, avoid impact by moving out of the heated areas. There seems to be a conflict in some temperate fish between temperature preference behaviour and safeguarding normal reproduction.

To do so, the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic and water temperature model was used with data from 10 climate models representing two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5) over two future time periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2100). The results showed an upward trend in projected water temperatures for all tested discharge rates from the impounding reservoir during the warmest periods of the year. The study found that water temperatures are expected to increase by up to 2.57 degrees C for the near future (2041-2070) and up to 3.56 degrees C on average for all flow scenarios studied for a far future (2071-2100) when using SSP5-8.5. The timing of the peak water temperature during the summer is also expected to shift, with maximum water temperatures occurring up to 10days later than in the reference period. In 10.3% of the far future SSP5-8.5 scenarios, at least one day per summer had a mean daily temperature of at least 24 degrees C, which exceeds limits of 20 degrees C for sockeye salmon and 21 degrees C for white sturgeon which are considered detrimental for the fish. It has been shown that over 50% of sockeye salmon will stop their sustained swimming at water temperatures of 24 degrees C due to cardiac limitations.

The combination of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid distributions and published pollen and plant macrofossil records for the lake sediments underlying the peat reveal that the region experienced a warmer and wetter period before ca. 6 ka that corresponds to the monsoon maximum and Holocene climate optimum in northeast China. The climate then entered a cold and wet period from 6 to 4 ka. A shift to warmer and drier conditions starting 4 ka is recorded as a transformation from a shallow lake to a peat deposit. From 1.5 to 0.4 ka, the region entered a cold and wet period that was followed by warm and dry conditions for the most recent 0.4 ky. Our lipid-based paleoclimate reconstruction was compared with Holocene reconstructions based on lipid records from the nearby Hani peat sequence, peat cellulose delta C-13 results from the Jinchuan peat sequence, and pollen records from other lakes in northeast China. Most of the regional paleoclimate changes reconstructed from the lipid proxies in the Sanjiang Plain peat sequence have a strong link with sea surface temperature changes in the Sea of Japan that were influenced by summer solar insolation at 65 degrees N and the East Asia summer monsoon. In contrast, the change to the warmer and drier conditions of the last four centuries seems to be mainly a consequence of human activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The variation of the parameter b for all seasons combined was significantly allometric, for both encircled towed and gillnets, with a quite robust fit (R2 equals 0.925 and 0.947, respectively) and values equal to 2.254 and 2.089, respectively. The specimens were significantly lighter in summer than in the other seasons. The slopes of the LWRs significantly differ between seasons and exhibited relatively low values when compared to other ecosystems worldwide and in the same ecosystem in previous periods of time.

The tectonic evolution of the Zhada Basin region, located between the Himalayan Mountains in the S and the Transhimalayan Mountains in the N, is poorly understood, but sediment accumulation was probably initiated in response to the middle/late Miocene uplift of the Gurla Mandhata and Leo Pargil domes in the E and W, respectively. The sedimentary record can be subdivided into five stratigraphic units with distinctly different lithofacies associations (LA); these are, from bottom to top: a bedload-dominated fluvial LA (Unit 1, 0-90 m); a nearshore lacustrine, deltaic LA (Unit 2, 90-220 m); an offshore lacustrine LA (Unit 3, 220-500 m); a nearshore lacustrine, fan-delta LA (Unit 4,500-600 m); and a fan-delta/alluvial fan LA (Unit 5, 600-810 m). Clast and heavy mineral compositions revealed sediment supply from two different provenance areas, one from the south and one from the north/east, based on catchment geology of the Himalaya and Transhimalaya. Ostracode faunal assemblages are largely comparable to those of modern Tibetan lakes and allow the reconstruction of paleo-lake environments, including lake-level changes and salinity. The sedimentary pattern shows strong cyclicity at various scales (m, 10 s m, and >100 m). Small-scale cycles are interpreted as intrinsically-controlled depositional processes of deltas (lobe switching), whereas medium- and large-scale cycles are most likely forced by climate fluctuations. The overall evolution of the sedimentologic record includes: a strong and rapid increase in fluvial discharge in the uppermost portion of Unit 1, a transition from fluvial to lacustrine deposition during deposition of Unit 2, rhythmic variations in the style of lacustrine sedimentation during deposition of Unit 3, an increase in the supply of coarse clastics starting with deposition of Unit 4, and a transition from lacustrine to alluvial sedimentation during deposition of Unit 5. We speculate that the increase in discharge and, presumably, precipitation leading to the establishment of lacustrine conditions in the lower part of the section (Unit 2) is largely due to regional summer monsoon intensification during the late Miocene, and that the transition from lacustrine to alluvial sedimentation in the uppper part of the section reflects the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and winter monsoon strengthening at similar to 2.6 Ma.

J	Millspaugh, SH; Whitlock, C; Bartlein, PJ				Millspaugh, SH; Whitlock, C; Bartlein, PJ			Variations in fire frequency and climate over the past 17 000 yr in central Yellowstone National Park	GEOLOGY												A 17000 yr fire history from Yellowstone National Park demonstrates a strong link between changes in climate and variations in fire frequency on millennial time scales. The the history reconstruction is based on a detailed charcoal stratigraphy from Cygnet Lake in the rhyolite plateau region. Macroscopic charcoal particles were tallied from contiguous 1 cm samples of a 6.69-m-long core, and the data were converted to charcoal-accumulation rates at evenly spaced time intervals. Intervals of high charcoal-accumulation rates were interpreted as local fire events on the basis of information obtained from modern charcoal-calibration studies in the Yellowstone region. The record indicates that fire frequency was moderate (4 fires/1000 yr) during the late glacial period, reached highest values in the early Holocene (>10 tires/1000 yr), and decreased after 7000 calendar Sr B.P. The present fire regime (2-3 fires/1000 yr) was established in the past 2000 Sr The charcoal stratigraphy correlates well with variations in July insolation through time, which suggests that regional climate changes are responsible for the long-term variations in fire frequency. In the early Holocene, summer insolation was near its maximum, which resulted in warmer, effectively drier conditions throughout the northwestern United States. At this time, the fire frequency near Cygnet Lake was at its highest. After 7000 calendar ST B.P., summer insolation decreased to present values, the regional climate became cooler and wetter, and fires were less frequent. The Cygnet Lake record suggests that long-term fire frequencies have varied continuously with climate change, even when the vegetation has remained constant.

In East Dongting Lake, Carex life history synchronize the arrival of overwintering birds, Carex meadow provide vital wintering ground for migratory waterbirds, especially for the Lesser White-fronted Geese. However, significant changes had taken place in the hydrological regime of East Dongting Lake and our research showed it caused chiefly by sediment deposition in the lake basin and the replenishment of the Three Gorges Dam. The annual lowest water level of the East Dongting Lake had gradually risen and the annual water level amplitude had decreased obviously over the past 60 years. Since the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the average water level increased significantly from January to June. The Three Gorges Dam holder the incoming water from late September to late October that the status will change from flood control limited water level to normal water level, meanwhile the water level of East Dongting Lake declined significantly through the same duration, especially in October. The operation of the Three Gorges Dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22-m elevation, resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation-covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern. As the timing of water level recession at elevations of 24-27 m were 12, 17, 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981-2002, the optimum elevation for Carex growth decreased from 25-26 m to 24-25 m. After the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the annual reversal times of water level increased significantly, which is not conducive to the formation of stable habitat and the utilization of resources by organisms.

Internal wave weather heterogeneity in a deep multi-basin subalpine lake resulting from wavelet transform and numerical analysis	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												The internal wave-field of a Y-shaped lake (Lake Como, North Italy) was investigated over a 3-year long period applying wavelet time-frequency analysis to temperature and wind data time series, recorded at the edge of each of the three arms. The comparison with the results from a modal model allowed to identify the presence of both first and second vertical modes of oscillations. The field data analysis underlined a heterogeneous baroclinic response with the eastern arm decoupled from the remaining part of the lake constituted by the northern and western arms (north-south west transect). This disjoined response is expected to enhance the water exchange between the northern and the western arm, with relevant consequences on the inter-basins water exchanges and on the distribution of chemical and biological species. In the north-south west transect the analysis of the low power signals in winter underlined a residual internal wave activity ascribed to the first vertical free mode of oscillation (V1H1).

J	Moreau, S; Le Toan, T				Moreau, S; Le Toan, T			Biomass quantification of Andean wetland forages using ERS satellite SAR data for optimizing livestock management	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Spatio-temporal information on the biomass of totora reeds and bofedal water-saturated Andean grasslands, which are a critical forage resource for smallholders in Bolivia's Altiplano, is needed to promote their protection and improve livestock management. Satellite radar data appear well adapted to map biomass and to monitor biomass changes in this environment for two reasons: (a) the C-band (5.3 GHz) radar data is particularly sensitive to vegetation biomass when the canopy is over an underlying water surface or a water-saturated soil; this is through the dominant scattering mechanisms involving vegetation-water surface interaction; (b) the cloud cover during the growing period which corresponds to the rainy season. This paper assesses the potential of ERS satellite radar data for retrieving biomass information, which is spatially highly variable owing to the numerous small, nonuniform areas of totora harvesting and bofedal grazing. Ground data, including vegetation humid and dry biomass, were collected over 18 months during satellite descending passes at 12 sites located between the Eastern Cordillera and Titicaca Lake, representing three vegetation units: shoreline and inland totoras, and Puna bofedales. ERS-SAR data were analysed as a function of plant biomass at homogeneous totora and bofedal areas. Because of the small size of these areas (typically 20 x 30 m), the SAR data need to be processed using an advanced multitemporal filter which improves radiometric resolution without significant reduction of the spatial resolution. The radar backscattering coefficient (sigmadegrees in dB) measured by ERS was found to be sensitive at both per site and per vegetation unit levels to humid and dry biomass of totora reeds and bofedal grasslands. The sensitivity of the signal to biomass variation is high for dry biomass ranges less than 1 kg/m(2) for totora, and less than 2 kg/m(2) for bofedal. The corresponding biomass maps provided by inversion of SAR data are valuable information for livestock management for three critical periods: after the calving season (October-November), when animal pressure is most significant; toward the end of the rainy season (March-April), as an indicator of coming trends to promote the adoption of measures aimed at preventing shortages during the winter season; in the middle of the winter dry season (June-July), to adjust animal charge.

J	BUTTLE, JM; FRASER, KE				BUTTLE, JM; FRASER, KE			HYDROCHEMICAL FLUXES IN A HIGH ARCTIC WETLAND BASIN DURING SPRING SNOWMELT	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Hydrochemical transport within a small fen basin on Axel Heiberg Island, N.W.T., was examined during the 1990 spring melt. Snow cover, lake inflow, hillslope runoff, and basin outflow were monitored for pH, conductivity, and the storage and flux of five major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-). Ca2+ dominated the ionic load in the premelt snowpack. Although there were substantial spatial and temporal variations in runoff, ion concentrations and export rates from the basin's slopes, transport of all ions tended to rise during periods of increased runoff. Runoff became depleted in H+ and enriched in the remaining ions to varying degrees as meltwater interacted with basin soils. H+ was retained on hillslopes, while there was net export of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Cl- to the fen. Differences in active layer thickness within the basin appeared to have an important control on the contact time between infiltrating meltwater and the soil; these differences in turn accounted for spatial variations in net ionic export from the hillslopes. The snowpack represented 51 % of the total water input to the basin; however, snow cover made only a minor contribution to total ionic inputs. H+, Na+, K+, and Cl- were retained in the wetland, while there was net export of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the basin. Weathering and cation exchange between H+-rich meltwater and alkaline soils were likely responsible for the release of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to surface runoff.																			0004-0851					MAY	1992	24	2					153	164		10.2307/1551535	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551535													WOS:A1992HU71300006

Chlorophyll concentrations at Stn. 1 were higher (> 10 mu g l(-1)) than at the other five stations (< 3 mu g l(-1)). Planktonic and sessile diatoms dominated at Stn. 1, while pico-phytoplankon was dominant at other stations. Densities of heterotrophic bacteria were high in both the epilimnion and the thermocline at all stations. Nanoflagellates were abundant in the epilimnion, and ciliates in the thermocline, but no horizontal trend could be found for these heterotrophs. At Stn. 1, not only filter feeding (Strombidium and Strobilidium) and raptorial (Balanion) ciliates but also predatory ciliates (Prorodon and Spathidiosus) dominated, while at other stations only the filter feeding and raptorial ciliates were dominant. In off-shore stations (Stns. 5 and 6), significant correlations were detected between concentrations of chlorophyll a and density of filter feeding or raptorial ciliates, suggesting tight food linkages between phytoplankton and these ciliates. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, although there was no significant correlation between DOC concentration and bacterial density. We suggest that there is a shift of the dominant food linkage from a herbivorous food chain in near-shore areas to a microbial food web in off-shore areas in Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal.

We studied sediment P mobility in Vortsjarv, a large shallow lake in Estonia using both sorption experiments and long-term (1985-2020) monitoring data of the lake. Over the years studied, the lake has undergone a dedine in external phosphorus loading (EL), while no improvement in phytoplankton indicators was observed. The results of the sorption experiments revealed that it may be successfully used as a tool to determine P forms involved in P retention, as up to 100% of the P from the water column was detected in sediments. Incubation of wet sediment is preferred to dry because of the sensitivity of organic P to desiccation. In the sediments of Vortsjarv, the labile P (Lab-P) and iron bound (Fe-P) fractions are the major forms of the mobile pool that supply internal P load as sediment released P. The internal P load calculated from summer total P (TP) increases (ILin situ) in the water column was on average 42%, but could reach 240% of EL at extreme environmental conditions. ILin situ was correlated with the active area, which resembles the area involved in redox-related P release in polymictic lakes, and with the mean bottom shear stress in summer. ILin situ showed a similar decreasing pattern as the external P load over the years 1985-2020, and was likely driven by the decrease of the pool of releasable P. Similarly, the decreases in sediment loading by P retention in our P sorption experiment were associated with decreases in the concentration of the potentially mobile P forms (mainly lab-P and Fe-P). These results show that changes in external P loading can successfully control internal P loading and are useful in water quality management of large lakes.

The analyses are based on data obtained from four hydrological and two climatological stations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model was used to quantitatively separate the effects of climate change from the effects arising from the operation of the dam reservoir. An analysis of the effects of reservoir operation on the phase synchronization between air and river water temperatures based on a continuous wavelet transform was also conducted. The analyses showed that there has been an increase in the average air temperature of the study area in November by 1.2 degrees C per decade (over the period 1984-2016), accompanied by an increase in winter water temperature of 0.3 degrees C per decade over the same period. As water and air temperatures associated with the river not influenced by the reservoir increased, there was a simultaneous reduction in the duration of ice cover, reaching nine days per decade. The river influenced by the dam reservoir showed a 1.05 degrees C increase in winter water temperature from the period 1994-2007 to the period 1981-1994, for which the operation of the reservoir was 65% responsible and climatic conditions were 35% responsible. As a result of the reservoir operation, the synchronization of air and water temperatures was disrupted. Increasing water temperatures resulted in a reduction in the average annual number of days with ice cover (by 27.3 days), for which the operation of the dam reservoir was 77.5% responsible, while climatic conditions were 22.5% responsible.					; Fuks, Maksymilian/NGQ-9819-2025	Kedra, Mariola/0000-0003-3953-9823; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				NOV	2024	38	11					4275	4294		10.1007/s00477-024-02803-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-024-02803-2		AUG 2024											WOS:001299703800001

Procercoids, the larval stage of parasitic cestodes, infest copepods as their first intermediate host. Therefore, in spring 2011, zooplankton samples were taken weekly at two sampling sites and depth ranges to determine the abundances of crustaceans as well as percentages of infected copepods and temporal occurrence of parasites. In addition, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) stomach contents were analysed for food spectrum and parasite infestation. From the end of June to mid-August, procercoids of Triaenophorus spp. were detected in Cyclops abyssorum, the only first intermediate host for this parasite in Lake Achensee. Highest percentages of infected copepods were reached in mid-July (prevalence: 0.38%). Furthermore, an infestation of Proteocephalus sp. was observed in this copepod species, which occurred earlier until the end of the sampling period (prevalence: 1.34%). Besides C. abyssorum, also Eudiaptomus gracilis was occasionally infected with Proteocephalus (prevalence: 0.05%). The procercoids were found in both depth ranges, with no clear vertical infestation preference. More C. abyssorum female were Triaenophorus-infected than males, while the opposite was observed for Proteocephalus infection. The whitefish stomachs contained large numbers of Proteocephalus and Triaenophorus procercoids, coinciding with the occurrence of these parasites in the copepods.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	1					40	49		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.1021	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.1021													WOS:000352405900005
J	Wang, J; Georgakakos, KP				Wang, J; Georgakakos, KP			Validation and sensitivities of dynamic precipitation simulation for winter events over the Folsom Lake Watershed: 1964-99	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A total of 62 winter-storm events in the period 1964-99 over the Folsom Lake watershed located at the windward slope of the Sierra Nevada were simulated with a 9-km resolution using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5). Mean areal precipitation (MAP) over the entire watershed and each of four Subbasins was estimated based on gridded simulated precipitation. The simulated MAP was verified with MAP estimated (a) by the California Nevada River Forecast Center (CNRFC) for the four subbasins based on eight operational precipitation stations, and (b) for the period from 1980 to 1986, on the basis of a denser precipitation observing network deployed by the Sierra Cooperative Pilot Project (SCPP). A number of sensitivity runs were performed to understand the dependence of model precipitation on boundary and initial fields, cold versus warm start, and microphysical parameterization. The principal findings of the validation analysis are that (a) MM5 achieves a good percentage bias score of 103% in simulating Folsom basin MAP when compared to MAP derived from dense precipitation gauge networks; (b) spatial grid resolution higher than 9 kin is necessary to reproduce the spatial MAP pattern among subbasins of the Folsom basin; and (c) the model performs better for heavy than for light and moderate precipitation. The analysis also showed significant simulation dependence on the spatial resolution of the boundary and initial fields and on the microphysical scheme used.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				JAN	2005	133	1					3	19		10.1175/MWR-2814.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-2814.1													WOS:000226838700001

Because of increasing human population, industrialization and uses biggest quantity of fertilizers water is permanently polluted with different contaminants. Is very important to found new water resources or to use carefully water, even the destination is for drinking or for tourism and recreation. The paper intends to analyze some physic chemical parameters of three types of water. The samples were collected from Danube River, a natural spring and Brates Lake. It was choose those types of water for analyses because Danube River is a most important water source for drinking water in Galati city, water from a natural spring is used by many peoples for drinking and Brates Lake is an area for fishing, swimming, tourism and recreation. In order to that it is very important to tests water from these sources. It was evaluate physic-chemical parameters such as: pH, conductivity, content of anions (Cl-, No-3(-),SO42-) CCO (oxygen chemical consumption) and dissolved oxygen. The water quality evaluation was related to water quality parameters for drinking water established by the Romanian legislation the law 458/2002 according with European environmental legislation (Drinking water Directive 98/83/CE). The results showed that the tested waters have, with some exceptions, the physico-chemical parameters in agreement with the standard for drinking water according by the Romanian legislation.

Mass Change Values of Landbird Migrants at an Inland Stopover Site Dominated by Nonnative Vegetation	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Early successional habitats are declining in eastern North America while at the same time remaining habitats are being invaded by a suite of nonnative shrub species. While the significance of these transitional habitats to breeding birds is well known, increasing evidence suggests they are important during the postfledging/premigratory and migratory periods, not only for shrub-nesting species but also for many species that breed in late-successional habitats. Additionally a number of studies suggest exotic species have the potential to alter habitat quality, in turn affecting the fitness of migratory landbirds. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fitness correlates associated with migrant use of shrubland habitat dominated by nonnative honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) in order to gauge habitat quality for spring migrants using an inland stopover site in northeastern Pennsylvania. We used estimates of mass change as our fitness indicator, with positive mass change indicating quality habitat. Our results suggest most birds gain mass while using honeysuckle-dominated habitat and many species, including species that characteristically breed in forested habitats, accrue fitness advantages from using shrubland habitat during spring stopover in northeastern Pennsylvania. However, we emphasize the need to examine the cumulative effects of exotic vegetation through multiple stages of the avian annual cycle to better understand the fitness consequences of nonnative vegetation on migratory landbirds.

J	Li, LL; Xue, B; Yao, SC; Tao, YQ; Yan, RH				Li, Lingling; Xue, Bin; Yao, Shuchun; Tao, Yuqiang; Yan, Renhua			Spatial-temporal patterns of methane dynamics in Lake Taihu	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes are important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Especially for large and shallow lakes, accurate CH4 emission budgets must consider the spatial and seasonal heterogeneity which characterize these ecosystems. CH4 concentrations in sediment and lake water and CH4 fluxes from sediment were analysed in selected open water areas of Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, to test the hypothesis that CH4 concentrations and fluxes differ both spatially and temporally in relation to biological and environmental features. The results showed that Lake Taihu was a source of CH4 throughout the year. The observed CH4 concentrations and fluxes were higher in the north-western and south-eastern areas of the lake, and lower in the central area. This spatial heterogeneity in methane emissions was mainly related to local organic matter content, plant characteristics, deposition rate and sediment features. Seasonally, CH4 showed stronger emissions in summer. These results suggest that the analysis of CH4 dynamics in shallow lakes should consider the habitat heterogeneity and the different sources of organic matter. Furthermore, the CH4 emission budget should at least include high and low temperature periods to decrease temporal bias.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2018	822	1					143	156		10.1007/s10750-018-3670-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3670-4													WOS:000440587800009

However, spatial patterns of surface input and partitioning of meltwater between different pathways to the base remain poorly understood. To further our understanding of surface drainage, we apply a supraglacial hydrology model to the Paakitsoq region, West Greenland for three contrasting melt seasons. During an average melt season, crevasses drain similar to 47% of surface runoff, lake hydrofracture drains similar to 3% during the hydrofracturing events themselves, while the subsequent surface-to-bed connections drain similar to 21% and moulins outside of lake basins drain similar to 15%. Lake hydrofracture forms the primary drainage pathway at higher elevations (above similar to 850 m) while crevasses drain a significant proportion of meltwater at lower elevations. During the two higher intensity melt seasons, model results show an increase (similar to 5 and similar to 6% of total surface runoff) in the proportion of runoff drained above similar to 1300 m relative to the melt season of average intensity. The potential for interannual changes in meltwater partitioning could have implications for how the dynamics of the ice sheet respond to ongoing changes in meltwater production.					; Colgan, William/H-1570-2014; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021	Pope, Allen/0000-0001-9699-7500; Colgan, William/0000-0001-6334-1660; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				JUN	2017	63	239					464	476		10.1017/jog.2017.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2017.5													WOS:000401649100006

The Qinghai Lake (QHL) Basin is a climate-sensitive region of significant importance in paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, the reconstructed climatic variations based on delta C-13(org) in aeolian sediments in the QHL Basin in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are lacking, and their paleoclimatic significance remains poorly understood. By conducting delta C-13(org) measurements on the Niaodao (ND) aeolian profile near QHL, we reconstructed the paleoclimate changes of 11 ka-present. The variation range of the delta C-13(org) values in the ND profile indicated the terrestrial ecosystems were not the sole contributor to lacustrine organic matter. The delta C-13(org) values are an indicator of historical temperature changes in the study area, exhibiting similar trends with the reconstruction of Chinese summer temperatures, East Asian air temperature, global temperature, and Northern Hemisphere summer insolation at 37 degrees N. The temperature increased with high frequency and amplitude oscillations, with strong aeolian activity and low total organic carbon accumulation during the Early Holocene. The temperature was maintained at a high and stable level, with the weakest aeolian activity and intensified pedogenesis during the Middle Holocene. The temperature decreased at a high rate, with renewed aeolian activity and weak pedogenesis during the Late Holocene.

However, most of the research on a small spatiotemporal scale and there is a lack of studies on the impact of hydrological processes on migratory bird habitats. This study analysed the response of the Poyang Lake wetland landscape to low water levels from 1990 to 2016 and determined the relationship between hydrological processes, wetland landscape characteristics and migratory bird habitats. According to the results, the number of days during the study period when the maximum water level was higher than the current water level (MaxDay) and the average water level from the 40th to 50th day prior to the current day (D50) are two critical factors affecting the area of grassland in Poyang Lake. In particular, a D50 value of 9.5-11.0 m is important for maintaining the grassland area and growth of wetland vegetation. Besides, the water level should not exceed 11 m from mid-late October to early November and should be maintained between 7.58 and 7.97 m in mid-late December that can maximize the habitat area of migratory birds. Furthermore, this study used ecological threshold to propose the optimal inundation period of Cyperus rotundus L. community, Leersia japonica community, Polygonum criopolitanum community, Phragmites australis community, Triarrhena lutarioriparia community, Carex spp. community and Phalaris arundinacea community, which are 124-174, 31-101, 199-249, 65-147, 51-121, 110-190 and 175-253 days, respectively.

On the decadal scale, a change in bioassay response to macronutrient enrichment took place around 1980, with a decrease in the frequency of N stimulation and an increase in the frequency of P stimulation. On the annual scale, an effect of spring mixing depth on the size of the bioassay response could be observed: stronger mixing events resulted in a more positive response. On the seasonal scale, the response magnitude was affected by stratification, but the significance of the response was independent of season. in a subset of the bioassays, in vivo fluorescence and chlorophyll a were measured in addition to inorganic C-14 uptake, bioassay results were essentially the same, regardless of which of these three bioassay response indicators was used.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1993	50	7					1489	1496		10.1139/f93-170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-170													WOS:A1993MA27900017

Assessment of Temperate Floodplain Pondscapes Using Small Littoral Fish as Indicators	WETLANDS												The aim of our study was to assess the ecosystem state of floodplain pondscapes by analyzing differences in fish assemblages between water bodies. Using QGIS, we identified 634 water bodies and delineated 49 pondscapes in the upper reaches of the Khoper River (Black Sea Basin), which is located in the center of European Russia. We surveyed 36 water bodies within 6 pondscapes to determine the species structure and relative abundance of fish via the active (dip net) and passive (funnel trap) methods. A total of 11 fish species were observed, and most of the water bodies were inhabited by one to three species. The alpha diversity and gamma diversity were dependent on oxygen levels and plant cover, which were related to spring flooding. Different pondscapes had different dominant species that indicated their conditions: Carassius carassius (overgrown and desiccated), Carassius gibelio (large and mosaic), Rhodeus sericeus (water exchange with the river), Misgurnus fossilis (hypoxic) and Perccottus glenii (accessible to humans). Our study revealed that changes in fish beta diversity indicate changes in more factors than changes in alpha diversity or gamma diversity. Homogeneous fish assemblages appeared when spring flood inundation decreased and water bodies became overgrown. The results of our study may be useful for further assessments of floodplain water bodies at the pondscape scale.

J	Qi, YY; Tong, P				Qi, Yingyu; Tong, Ping			Structure of the Crustal Magmatic System in the Geysers-Clear Lake Area (Northern California) Imaged by Adjoint-State Travel-Time	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Clear Lake volcanic field (CLVF) in northern California powers the world's largest geothermal power plant, the Geysers Geothermal Complex. Volcanic-type earthquakes, hot springs, and seepage of volcanic gas suggest possible volcanic eruptions in the future. In this study, we apply a recently developed adjoint-state travel-time tomogra-phy method to high-quality manually picked P- and S-wave travel-time data to create 3D crustal VP and VS models for the Geysers-Clear Lake area. The adjoint-state travel -time tomography method has advantages of computational efficiency, ease of parallel implementation, and high accuracy in dealing with complex media. Strong velocity heterogeneities are revealed in the Geysers-Clear Lake area and its surrounding regions. Within the overall high VP, high VS Coast Ranges, a low VP, low VS anomaly is imaged beneath Mount Hannah, which indicates the existence of a large magma chamber. Our tomographic results suggest a simplified three-layer magmatic model beneath the CLVF: the upper layer (<7 km) consists of some intrusions of silicic magma from beneath Mount Hannah to the Geysers Geothermal Field in the southwest and to the Wilbur Springs area east of Clear Lake; the median layer includes the main body of the magma chamber at 5-13 km in depth and in the shape of an oblate ellipsoid; and the lower layer includes some mafic intrusions and molten or partially molten volcanic rocks from the upwelling mantle. The detailed velocity heterogeneities revealed by the newly picked travel-time data with the adjoint-state travel-time tomography method provide neces-sary constraints on seismogenic, volcanic, and geothermal processes in the Geysers -Clear Lake area, which are also useful for the mitigation of geologic hazards in northern California.

A total of 392 algal taxa (gamma diversity) were identified, of which 212 taxa (54.08%) belonged to Bacillariophyta while the rest (180 taxa) belonged to seven other groups (Chlorophyta, Charophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, Miozoa, Ochrophyta, and Cryptophyta). 150 taxa were encountered only once. The highest alpha diversity was found in ditches (H' =4.57, 235 taxa) followed by streams (H' = 4.40, 238 taxa), and the lowest diversity was recovered in troughs (H' = 2.62, 42 taxa). Relatively high Whittaker's beta diversity (Bw = 19) indicated a low level of similarity among sampling sites suggesting that no common taxonomic group was solely effective enough to change dominancy level of any species among the habitats. The first two axes of Canonical Correspondence Analysis accounted for 58.1 % of the total variance in the occurrence of 152 algal taxa (all taxa recovered from more than three samples) and described gradients across four environmental variables (habitat type, pH, elevation and water temperature). Ditches significantly contribution to alpha and gamma diversity in the province although they have relatively small surface area and shallow water compared to other habitat types. High alpha diversity in ditches may be related to the positive effect of geographic and climatic factors in mountainous area. Future possibilities are discussed.

J	Lair, N; Reyes-Marchant, P				Lair, N; Reyes-Marchant, P			The potamoplankton of the Middle Loire and the role of the 'moving littoral' in downstream transfer of algae and rotifers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal succession of the potamoplankton of the Middel Loire was studied fortnightly from June to October 1995, a period of low water flow. The increase in dissolved oxygen, suspended matter, BOD5 and chlorophyll a, associated with the decrease in nutrients downstream, are typical of eutrophic rivers. Algae were the principal components of the suspended matter flux in the river. Their density increased from the upper site of Dampierre-en-Burly to the lower site of Saint-Laurent des Eaux, with respective maxima of 68 x 10(6) cells l(-1) and 106 x 10(6) cells l(-1). A large rotifer community developed in association with the algal growth, with densities up to 3700 ind l(-1) at Dampierre-en-Burly and up to 5800 ind l(-1) at Saint-Laurent des Eaux. They had a high Shannon-Weaver diversity, while grazing appeared to control the algae. As the year progressed to the warmer season, the biomass of the beta and beta alpha mesosaprobic rotifer species increased parallel with algae. The water theoretically transported potamoplankton at 0.2 m s(-1) during mid-summer, which meant that the biomass of the algae doubled in minimum 17 km and that of the rotifers in 34 km. From these values and the distances between sampling stations, we deduce that inoculation points were located in areas which could be as short as a hundred meters. Not only algae, but also rotifers are capable of restoring an inoculum of organisms from place to place. Summer hydrodynamics, close to localised lentic areas, were responsible for an increase in plankton abundance in the stream. These movements had an ecotone effect at the boundary between standing and running water, creating pulses. The lower regions were progressively enriched by successive inoculates, dilution and seeding inputs, which did not prevent the growth of algae and of parthenogenetic species in the river. Such processes, which occur in years of low flow, are responsible for the large variations in plankton density observed between years.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 10	1997	356						33	52		10.1023/A:1003127230386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003127230386													WOS:000071763000004

J	Ouimet, C				Ouimet, C			Implications of Chaoborus pupation and ecdysis in cold water	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Cold water acted differently to delay and lengthen the pupation period for the larvae of two species of the zooplankton predator Chaoborus (Diptera: Chaoboridae). During Chaoborus pupation, the zooplankton community is released from predation, while the dark-coloured Chaoborus pupae are more susceptible to their own predators. 2. Fourth instar larvae of Chaoborus americanus and C. trivittatus, collected from an oligotrophic lake, were reared individually at 5 degreesC in the dark. Chaoborus americanus was also reared at 9 and 12 degreesC under spring photoperiod conditions (L : D, 16 : 8 h). Individuals were observed through pupation to emergence (ecdysis) or death. 3. Chaoborus americanus pupated at 5, 9 and 12 degreesC with substantial emergence only at 12 degreesC. In comparison, C. trivittatus emerged at 5 degreesC. Light was not a necessary cue for pupation and ecdysis, contrary to previous reports. Cold water delayed the onset and lengthened and increased the variability of the duration of pupation. 4. In Shirley Lake, C. americanus pupated in late June-early July while C. trivittatus pupated first in April and again in June-July. 5. Chaoborus americanus pupae needed a temperature cue to complete ecdysis. The ecdysis temperature threshold helps to explain the difference in pupation timing, and the geographical distribution, of C. americanus and its relatively inflexible life history contrasted with C. trivittatus. Delayed predator pupation in years with low spring temperature can affect the community dynamics of the prey.																			0046-5070					SEP	2001	46	9					1169	1177		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00738.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00738.x													WOS:000171284900002
J	Dissanayake, P; Amft, J; Sibbertsen, P				Dissanayake, Pushpa; Amft, Johanna; Sibbertsen, Philipp			Defining an exposure index along the Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Sea coast	MARINE GEOLOGY												A wind exposure index (EI), which indicates the main physical driver of a coastal system, was developed along the Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Sea (SH) coast - Germany, to demonstrate the highly dynamic coastal stretches (i.e., potential erosion hotspots). The approach used three steps to define more accurate EIs. Initially, a representative wind year (RWY), which has similar physical characteristics as in the long-term data, was defined by analysing measured wind data from 2000 to 2019 at four stations distributed in the entire area of interest. The RWY was identified by a statistical comparison of wind speeds in 5 classes and 36 directional sectors between summer to summer yearly wind and the overall data. The selected RWY spanned from 01.09.2016 to 31.08.2017 and showed a reasonable agreement with the overall data (Skill = 0.77 and rmsd = 0.56 m/s). Next, high spatiotemporal nearshore hydrodynamics over the RWY were predicted using a model nesting approach of two domains in Delft3D. The predicted nearshore hydrodynamics indicated fair agreements with the measured data (R-2: 0.87-0.90 for water levels and 0.75-0.86 for wave heights). Finally, the predicted water level and wave height time series in the nearshore area (similar to 5 m MSL depth) were used for the analysis of the EI adopting a 2-step procedure capturing short- and long-term correlations as well as seasonal long-range dependencies of the time series. This approach allows to model the clustering behaviour of extreme values of both parameters and provides reasonable EIs along the SH coast. The exposed areas display high EIs (e.g., 1 at the east of Fehmarn), while sheltered areas and bays have low values (e.g., 0 at Eckernf & ouml;rde Bay). The higher the EI the stronger the coastal dynamics and thus strong erosion can be expected. Interestingly, the EI varies considerably even along the exposed coastal stretches with long fetches, which indicates the sensitivity of the EI to the local morphology, which determines the nearshore hydrodynamics. Therefore, a definition of the EI based on nearshore hydrodynamics provides an accurate index of local physical drivers of a coastal system. The developed approach can be adopted to any coast, and provides useful information on the potential erosion areas for the coastal managers.

J	Ledu, D; Rochon, A; de Vernal, A; St-Onge, G				Ledu, David; Rochon, Andre; de Vernal, Anne; St-Onge, Guillaume			Holocene paleoceanography of the northwest passage, Canadian Arctic Archipelago	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A series of cores (box and piston) were collected at 2 key locations in Lancaster Sound (cores 2004-804-009 BC and PC) and Barrow Strait (cores 2005-804-004 BC and PC) in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to document the evolution of sea-surface conditions in the main axis of the Northwest Passage during the Holocene time period. Reconstruction of sea-surface parameters (summer temperature and salinity, duration of sea-ice cover) were estimated based on transfer functions using dinoflagellate cyst assemblages as proxy indicators. The chronology of these cores is based on calibrated AMS-C-14 dates, Pb-210 analyses, and correlations between paleomagnetic secular variations of the geomagnetic field and a predicted spherical harmonic model of the geomagnetic field (CALS7 K.2). Our age models for both cores indicate that 009 PC spans the last 11,100 cal BP, while 004 PC encompasses the last 10,800 cal BP. Calculated sedimentation rates are in the range of 43-140 cm/kyr for core 009 PC and 15-118 cm/kyr for core 004 PC, allowing for a millennial time scale resolution in each core. Our results indicate relatively harsh conditions in Lancaster Sound between 10,800 and 9000 cal BP (summer temperatures 2 degrees C cooler than at present), which we associate with the presence of active ice-streams in northernmost Baffin Bay and a weak West Greenland Current. This is followed by a warming trend (up to 3 degrees C higher than present) that took place between (similar to)8500 and 5500 cal BP, which we associate with the Holocene thermal maximum and to a large scale atmospheric pattern such as the Arctic Oscillation operating at the millennial time scale. This is concomitant with an increase in the relative abundance of phototrophic dinoflagellate cyst taxa. A gradual cooling of sea-surface temperature and increased sea-ice follow this from 5500 cal BP until the modern period. In Barrow Strait, harsh sea-surface conditions prevailed from 11,100 to 5500 cal BP, with summer temperatures as low as 4 degrees C cooler than at present. The warming trend occurred later in this region (between 5500 and (similar to)1000 cal BP), after which a gradual cooling is observed until the modern period. The apparent shift, or opposite warming trends, between Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait after 5500 cal BP could be the result of a change in atmospheric circulation patterns related to a possible shift in the AO mode (from AO(+) to AO(-)). Comparison of ice core delta O-18 record from Devon Island ice cap and the reconstructed sea-surface temperature from core 009 PC suggests a strong atmospheric-oceanic coupling throughout the Holocene in this area.

Resilience of Alaska's boreal forest to climatic change	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												This paper assesses the resilience of Alaska's boreal forest system to rapid climatic change. Recent warming is associated with reduced growth of dominant tree species, plant disease and insect outbreaks, warming and thawing of permafrost, drying of lakes, increased wildfire extent, increased postfire recruitment of deciduous trees, and reduced safety of hunters traveling on river ice. These changes have modified key structural features, feedbacks, and interactions in the boreal forest, including reduced effects of upland permafrost on regional hydrology, expansion of boreal forest into tundra, and amplification of climate warming because of reduced albedo (shorter winter season) and carbon release from wildfires. Other temperature-sensitive processes for which no trends have been detected include composition of plant and microbial communities, long-term landscape-scale change in carbon stocks, stream discharge, mammalian population dynamics, and river access and subsistence opportunities for rural indigenous communities. Projections of continued warming suggest that Alaska's boreal forest will undergo significant functional and structural changes within the next few decades that are unprecedented in the last 6000 years. The impact of these social-ecological changes will depend in part on the extent of landscape reorganization between uplands and lowlands and on policies regulating subsistence opportunities for rural communities.					; Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019; Johnstone, Jill/C-9204-2009; Turetsky, Merritt/B-1255-2013; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Taylor, Donald/0000-0002-5985-9210; Johnstone, Jill/0000-0001-6131-9339; 													0045-5067	1208-6037				JUL	2010	40	7					1360	1370		10.1139/X10-074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X10-074													WOS:000281208900014

This paper presents pollen and microcharcoal data generated from a sediment core extracted from the coastal lake Eilandvlei spanning the last approximate to 8900 years. With an average sample resolution of 57 years, this record represents the highest resolution record of Holocene vegetation change from the region. The data indicate that cool, seasonal and moderately dry conditions characterized the Wilderness Embayment from approximate to 8900 to 8000calaBP. Afrotemperate forests expanded from approximate to 8000calaBP until 4700calaBP. This humid period is followed by indications of more arid and seasonal conditions until 3500calaBP. A long-term increase in forest taxa suggests steadily increasing moisture availability across the late Holocene. Strong affinities are noted with records from more tropical regions of South Africa, suggesting that tropical systems are of importance in maintaining higher moisture availability in the region. An important mechanism of climate change is the Agulhas Current, which transmits what appears to be a localized signal of tropical variability to the southern Cape coast.

Although this area is subject to a permanent snow avalanche activity and a potential risk of snow avalanches, it also benefits from significant winter tourist activities. For completing our analysis, we took into consideration the terrain factors and, using the GIS Software, we drew up the appropriate maps underlying the elevation, the slope and the aspect. Based on the topographic map, satellite images, our observations and the information from the members of Balea Lake Nivometeorology Programme and from the members of Mountain Rescuers, we have identified 29 snow avalanche paths with different locations: 21 on the eastern slope, 5 on the western slope and 3 in the glacial cirque. Using the climatic variables we managed to characterize and define the winter regime of snow avalanches. We also managed to set forth an altitudinal and morphological classification of the snow avalanche paths and to identify the most frequent snow avalanches. In this context, our study can represent the basis for future studies in the Fagaras massif or in the Romanian Carpathians related to the zoning of the snow avalanches and to the hazard and risk management of the snow avalanches.

A Broad, Distributed Active Fault Zone Lies beneath Salt Lake City, Utah	SEISMIC RECORD												Although the Wasatch fault is currently known to have a high-seismic hazard from motion along range-bounding faults, new seismic data reveal faulted and folded 13,000-30,000tion trench, borehole, and other geologic and geophysical observations, we conclude that a zone of latest Pleistocene and/or Holocene faulting and folding kinematically links the East Bench and Warm Springs faults through a 3 km wide relay structure and transfer zone. We characterize faults beneath downtown SLC as active, and these faults may displace or deform the ground surface during an earthquake. Through offset but linked faults, our observations support throughgoing ruptures across faults of the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) and an elevated risk of earthquake-induced building damage.

Dynamics of a small surge-type glacier using one-dimensional geophysical inversion	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We investigate the dynamics of a small surge-type valley glacier as part of a study to characterize glacier response to climate in the Donjek Range, southwest Yukon, Canada. Pole displacements were measured using kinematic GPS techniques during three consecutive summer field seasons. Measured surface velocities range from <10 m a(-1) over the lower 1500 m of the 5 km long glacier to a maximum of similar to 25-35 m a(-1) over the upper 3500 m. Basal velocities along an approximate flowline are reconstructed from the measured surface velocities using inverse methods. Control tests are used to validate the inversion scheme, and sensitivity tests are performed to evaluate the influence of the flow-law coefficient, shape factor and longitudinal averaging length. Inversion of the real data shows that basal motion accounts for 50-100% of the total surface motion along the flowline. Based on these results, and several other lines of evidence, we suggest this glacier may be undergoing a slow surge.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2009	55	194					1101	1112		10.3189/002214309790794850	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/002214309790794850													WOS:000276469500015

Distribution and Modeled Transport of Plastic Pollution in the Great Lakes, the World's Largest Freshwater Resource	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Most plastic pollution originates on land. As such, freshwater bodies serve as conduits for the transport of plastic litter to the ocean. Understanding the concentrations and fluxes of plastic litter in freshwater ecosystems is critical to our understanding of the global plastic litter budget and underpins the success of future management strategies. We conducted a replicated field survey of surface plastic concentrations in four lakes in the North American Great Lakes system, the largest contiguous freshwater system on the planet. We then modeled plastic transport to resolve spatial and temporal variability of plastic distribution in one of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie. Triplicate surface samples were collected at 38 stations in mid-summer of 2014. Plastic particles > 106 mu m in size were quantified. Concentrations were highest near populated urban areas and their water infrastructure. In the highest concentration trawl, nearly 2 million fragments km(-2) were found in the Detroit River-dwarfing previous reports of Great Lakes plastic abundances by over 4-fold. Yet, the accuracy of single trawl counts was challenged: within-station plastic abundances varied 0- to 3-fold between replicate trawls. In the smallest size class (106-1,000 mu m), false positive rates of 12-24% were determined analytically for plastic vs. non-plastic, while false negative rates averaged similar to 18%. Though predicted to form in summer by the existing Lake Erie circulation model, our transport model did not predict a permanent surface "Lake Erie Garbage Patch" in its central basin-a trend supported by field survey data. Rather, general eastward transport with recirculation in the major basins was predicted. Further, modeled plastic residence times were drastically influenced by plastic buoyancy. Neutrally buoyant plastics-those with the same density as the ambient water-were flushed several times slower than plastics floating at the water's surface and exceeded the hydraulic residence time of the lake. It is likely that the ecosystem impacts of plastic litter persist in the Great Lakes longer than assumed based on lake flushing rates. This study furthers our understanding of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes, a model freshwater system to study the movement of plastic from anthropogenic sources to environmental sinks.					; Wigginton, Krista/D-2553-2011	Cable, Rachel/0000-0002-5859-5612; Duhaime, Melissa/0000-0001-7884-5087														2296-665X					2017	5								45	10.3389/fenvs.2017.00045	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2017.00045													WOS:000458353200005

Ramon; Lavecchia, Giusy			High-Detail Fault Segmentation: Deep Insight into the Anatomy of the 1983 Borah Peak Earthquake Rupture Zone (Mw 6.9, Idaho, USA)	LITHOSPHERE												Following observations made in a survey campaign along the Lost River Fault (Idaho, USA) in 2019, we integrate both original and previously published data to obtain a detailed segmentation of the fault sections that failed in the 1983 Borah Peak earthquake (M-w 6.9). The earthquake ruptured the topographic surface with an oblique-normal faulting mechanism, activating two SW-dipping fault segments (Thousand Springs and Warm Springs) and a branching SSW-dipping fault (Arentson Gulch Fault) and producing coseismic surface ruptures with up to 3m of vertical separation. We augment the 1983 earthquake description by interpreting high-resolution topography and fault mapping. We use quality vertical separation data, rupture zone width measurements, and fault slip data to analyze major and minor structural-geometric complexities, highlighting a partition of the deformation and a fault segmentation into four detail levels (i.e., segments, sections, subsections, and sectors). Our work provides new details of the 1983 Borah Peak earthquake, constraints for paleoseismic and seismotectonic studies, and a methodological approach applicable in other areas of the world. Our fault-slip data show variations along fault-strike that we interpret as kinematic partitioning. In 1983, the main southern segment had a large rupture zone width, while the northern segment localized the deformation. The distributed ruptures accommodate a large portion of the rupture length (similar to 19.5 km versus 31 km for the main rupture) and displacement (similar to 66%). 83% of the surface faulting and 80% of the displacement are located at the hanging wall of the main rupture. There is a strong correlation between vertical separation, rupture zone width, rupture position (footwall or hanging wall), and fault geometry. We highlight the control of the obliquity and kinematic partitioning in the surface expression of the earthquake propagation. We interpret the coseismic (i.e., 1983) and long-term (i.e., Quaternary) behavior, showing that the two activated segments had similar cumulated behaviors in distributing the deformation between synthetic and antithetic ruptures, despite the different geometries. Our results have implications for fault rupture behavior with application to rupture hazard.

For typical seepage investigations baseline geophysical data are collected at "low-pool" level and the measurements are repeated when high hydraulic gradient conditions exist. At Coursier Lake Dam a rather unanticipated outcome of the low-cool surveys was that significant seepage beneath the structure was detected. The low-pool results were conclusive enough that, when combined with visual inspection and observation of sinkholes on the embankment, an immediate restriction was placed on the pool elevation. Thus, because of the identified potential hazard, the remaining geophysical investigations were conducted under a "minimum-pool" reservoir level in order to complete the comparative study. Therefore, the dam was studied under low-and minimum-pool reservoir conditions in the spring and fall of 1993, respectively. Low-pool data indicated very high resistivities (3000 to 5000 ohm-m) throughout the embankment indicating a coarse-average grain size, probably unsaturated sands and gravels. Higher resistivities (>5000 ohm-m) were obtained within the foundation deposits along the downstream toe indicating a combination of lower moisture content, coarser average grain size and higher porosity than the embankment. These electrical data indicate the subsurface conditions in the embankment and the foundation to be conducive to seepage. Results from low-pool SP surveys, performed both on-shore and offshore, indicate a dispersed or sheet flow seepage occurring nearly 1100 feet upstream of the intake. Therefore, apparently the seepage source begins far upstream of the embankment within the foundation deposits. Modeling the SP data indicated a number of anomalous areas interpreted as concentrated seepage flow paths within the foundation and lower portion of the embankment. The minimum-pool data, acquired when only a stream entered the intake structure, confirmed the low-pool electrical and SP interpretations. Remediation of the seepage problems at Coursier Lake Dam was completed in 1996 utilizing a combination of an upstream cutoff trench to reduce the seepage flow through the foundation, and placement of a geomembrane (tied into the cutoff trench) over approximately two-thirds of the core to reduce the flow gradients within the embankment.																									1997							321	331		10.4133/1.2922404	http://dx.doi.org/10.4133/1.2922404													WOS:000073241900033
J	Cooper, D; Gregory, IN				Cooper, David; Gregory, Ian N.			Mapping the English Lake District: a literary GIS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS												To date, much of the work that uses Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to study human geographies applies a social science paradigm to quantitative data. There is a growing recognition of the need, however, to test whether GIS can be used to map out the qualitative 'data' provided by the articulation of subjective spatial experiences. This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS.

The waterbody may be a kettle lake that formed on a moraine of the Two-Yurts Lake Valley, located on the eastern slope of the Central Kamchatka Mountain Chain. At present, it is a seepage lake with no surficial outflow. Fossil diatom assemblages show an almost constant ratio between planktonic and periphytic forms throughout the record. Downcore variations in the relative abundances of diatom species enabled division of the core into four diatom assemblage zones, mainly related to changes in abundances of Aulacoseira subarctica, Stephanodiscus minutulus, and Discostella pseudostelligera and several benthic species. Associated variations in the composition and content of organic matter are consistent with the diatom stratigraphy. The oldest recovered sediments date to about 3220 BC. They lie below a sedimentation hiatus and likely include reworked deposits from nearby Two-Yurts Lake. The initial lake stage between 870 and 400 BC was characterized by acidic shallow-water conditions. Between 400 BC and AD 1400, lacustrine conditions were established, with highest contributions from planktonic diatoms. The interval between AD 1400 and 1900 might reflect summer cooling during the Little Ice Age, indicated by diatoms that prefer strong turbulence, nutrient recycling and cooler summer conditions. The timing of palaeolimnological changes generally fits the pattern of neoglacial cooling during the late Holocene on Kamchatka and in the neighbouring Sea of Okhotsk, mainly driven by the prevailing modes of regional atmospheric circulation.					; Dirksen, Veronika/A-5322-2018; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016	Diekmann, Bernhard/0000-0001-5129-3649; Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2012	47	4					549	560		10.1007/s10933-012-9580-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9580-y													WOS:000302803700002

Polar deserts are the most extensive. The water budget of its basins is dominated by snowfall and snowmelt-generated runoff, giving rise to a nival regime of streamflow. Polar oases are warmer areas with enhanced evaporation and more variable flow than the deserts. Glaciers and late-lying snow cover provide late season high flows but experience low evaporation, though ice accumulation and melt constitute important storage changes. Wetlands have high flows similar to the polar desert, but evaporation reduces summer runoff, producing the distinctive wetland streamflow regime. Runoff ratios are high for polar deserts and glacierized basins, but the vegetated polar oases and wetlands exhibit ratios more comparable to the Low Arctic. A recent attempt to model a circumpolar water budget does not yield quantities that match field results, and further research is needed to refine the regional water balance.																			0144-7815		978-1-901502-82-4				2004	290						152	163																WOS:000248597300014

In field experiments, we investigated how the natural suite of chemicals occurring in a wholly vegetated lake as well as within plant-free mesocosms with artificial macrophytes and epiphytes (either fishless or containing small fish) influenced individual daphnid growth. In laboratory experiments, we further examined how water containing chemicals from either a submerged macrophyte (waterweed, Elodea canadensis), a planktivorous fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) or both impacted daphnid growth and life-history traits. In the field, we found the greatest suppression of daphnid growth in vials containing water from the wholly vegetated lake relative to growth of daphnids housed in vials containing spring water. Water from the mesocosm with fish also suppressed daphnid growth. Daphnid growth in water from the fishless mesocosm: which contained plastic plants colonized by epiphytes, did not differ from that of daphnids grown in spring water. In the lab experiment, daphnids exposed to Elodea chemicals took longer to mature and possessed fewer eggs than daphnids in media without Elodea chemicals. Daphnids exposed to chemicals from both Elodea and roach reproduced the earliest and at a smaller size. Daphnids exposed to only roach chemical cues did not significantly differ from daphnids in control media for age or size at first reproduction although they did possess fewer eggs. Daphnia responses to chemicals from either roach or Elodea alone did not predict how Daphnia responded to the combined influence of multiple chemical cues. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to macrophyte chemicals incurs costs for Daphnia.

A 27-h cycle and daily measurements were made in a summer situation. We observed strong relative diurnal variations, compared to seasonal variations, in alpha- and beta-glucosidase. Within 24 h, 0-100% of both alpha- and beta-golucosidase were found in the dissolved phase. The aminopeptidase activities did not show a strong diurnal variation, but day to day variations were similar in magnitude to seasonal changes. Consistently, high proportions of all three enzymes were found in the dissolved phase on a seasonal scale. Seasonal measurements at 50- and 100-m depths showed a weak negative dependency on depth for extracellular enzyme activity. The potential importance of both hourly and daily changes in extracellular enzyme activity and of free enzymes is considered.

In this work, the Canadian air quality model (GEM-MACH-TEB) is used to assess the importance of solvent emissions during the Michigan Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE). Model predictions are compared to ozone and total mono-substituted aromatics (TOLU) observations collected in Windsor, Ontario. For summer 2018, model estimates of TOLU from solvent emissions are smaller (30% for an 8 h daytime average) in Windsor than estimates from positive matrix factorization (44% for a 24 h average). The use of updated U.S. solvent emissions from the EPA's VCPy (Volatile Chemical Product framework) for summer 2021 simulations increases the solvent use source contribution over Detroit/Windsor (30-50% for an 8 h daytime average). This also provides a more uniform spatial distribution across the U.S./Canada border (30-50% for an 8 h daytime average). Long-chain alkanes are the dominant speciation in the model's air pollutant emission inventory and in the observation-derived solvent use factor. Summertime 8 h daytime ozone decreased by 0.4% over Windsor for a 10% solvent use VOC emission reduction scenario. A 10% mobile NOx emission reduction scenario resulted in a 0.6% O-3 decrease over Windsor and more widespread changes over the study region.					; Zhang, Junhua/V-2129-2018	Wren, Sumi/0000-0001-7895-4814; Majdzadeh, Mahtab/0000-0003-4226-1471; 														2073-4433				JUL	2023	14	7							1094	10.3390/atmos14071094	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14071094													WOS:001034976200001

Its broadly recognised counterpart is the Younger Dryas or Greenland Stadial-1 (ca. 12.85-11.65 cal. kyr BP based on the NGRIP ice core records). Our study suggests that accumulation of the analysed late-glacial sediments occurred in a deep and relatively cold water meso-eutrophic lake with a strong mixing regime and relatively high silica content. Combining these results together with available pollen-based environmental reconstructions we suggest that climate cooling, together with an intensified winter monsoon and thicker snow cover could influence changes in regional vegetation, sedimentation processes and trophic status of the lake during the transition from the last interstadial to stadial around Lake Suigetsu. A decrease in total pollen concentration and increase in Fagus pollen percentage indicate local vegetation stress/disturbances and suggest that cooling started at least 2-3 decades prior to the major shift in the inorganic sediment (accumulation of detrital layers) and in diatom assemblages (change from Aulacoseira ambigua to Aulacoseira subarctica dominance), which took about 10 years. The transition from the last stadial to the Holocene again shows that vegetation in the lake catchment area reacted first to the regional climate change, i.e. to the weakening of the winter monsoon and decrease in winter snow accumulation. The increase in the vegetation cover density and reduced volume of surface runoff associated with the decrease in melt water supply is likely responsible for the reduced soil erosion activity which caused the cessation in detrital layer accumulation and consequent decrease in the amount of nutrients brought to the lake and lowering of the water nutrient status. The latter process finally influenced changes in the diatom assemblages, including the return to dominance of A. subarctica ca. 30 years after the virtual disappearance of detrital layers from the sediment. Our results demonstrate the rapid response of the Lake Suigetsu system to the global cooling and subsequent warming, and allow clear definition of the onset and termination of the late-glacial climate reversal. Despite the fact that the lake system shows a more abrupt shift from the warm to cold (and cold to warm) environments than terrestrial records of vegetation demonstrate, we do not see any delayed response of local vegetation to the climate change. This last conclusion is of particular importance for application of the SG06 pollen record for quantitative climate reconstruction. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

J	Fan, JW; Xiao, JL; Qin, XG				Fan, Jiawei; Xiao, Jule; Qin, Xiaoguang			Millennial- and centennial-scale droughts at the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation: Sedimentological evidence from Dali Lake	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The semi-arid areas at the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) have experienced an increased frequency of drought in recent decades. However, it is unclear whether past monsoonal precipitation in the region were determined mainly by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability or high-latitude cooling. In this study, we use a high-resolution grain-size dataset combined with a new Bayesian age depth model of a sediment core from Dali Lake to analyze the occurrence of millennial- and centennial-scale droughts at the EASM margin during the interval of climatic warming during the last deglaciation. The polymodal grain size distributions are partitioned using a log-normal distribution function fitting method. High percentages of the coarse components (C4 + C5 + C6) are recognized as proxy indicators of strong aeolian activities and low lake levels, and thus droughts in the region. The drought events indicated thereby are generally accompanied by decreases in regional temperature, catchment surface runoff and bio-productivity, on both millennial and centennial timescales. These results imply that the droughts at the EASM margin were caused by a significantly weakened EASM intensity. In addition, the droughts may be linked, within the age uncertainties, to the Heinrich 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) events on millennial timescales, and to the Older Dryas (OD) cold event on centennial timescales, implying strong high-latitude forcing. Given that these cold reversals over northern high latitudes were induced by the rapid input of glacial melt-water to the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation, it is possible that ongoing climatic warming, and the resulting high northern-latitude ice-sheet melting, may cause an increased incidence of drought in northern China.

J	HOWARD, KWF; BECK, PJ				HOWARD, KWF; BECK, PJ			HYDROGEOCHEMICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION BY ROAD DEICING CHEMICALS	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												This hydrogeochemical study concerns the distribution, origins and behaviour of groundwaters in Quaternary sediments of southern Ontario, Canada, containing elevated concentrations of chloride. Major-ion, minor-ion and trace-metal analyses of 37 potential chloride sources and over 400 well waters, 70 urban springs and 30 pore waters are reported. Source chloride concentrations ranged up to 230,000 mg L-1 for brines from southwestern Ontario; for groundwaters in Quaternary sediments, the chlorides range up to 700 mg L-1 for domestic wells, 2,840 mg L-1 for urban springs and 13,700 mg L-1 for shallow pore waters. Regional studies performed in support of the study suggest that very little chloride enrichment is associated with natural chemical evolutionary processes. Background concentrations are in the range 15-20 mg L-1 and these levels are exceeded in over half the wells in the area; potential sources include road salts, landfill leachates, agricultural fertilizers and saline bedrock waters. Most of these sources are found to be chemically pure with 2 or 3 major ions occurring to the virtual exclusion of all other constituents. Source trace-metal concentrations are low and none are diagnostic of origin. Only iodide and fluoride prove useful indicators of source. Iodide is especially useful for differentiating between road salts and saline bedrock waters, sources which are normally indistinguishable using major-ion criteria alone. From an inorganic water quality perspective, trace-metal concentrations in the chloride sources do not appear to be an environmental concern and only the primary chemical components constitute a serious threat to groundwater potability.																			0169-7722					MAR	1993	12	3					245	268		10.1016/0169-7722(93)90010-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-7722(93)90010-P													WOS:A1993KY54200004

Microcystin levels and characterization of the different microcystin variants present were measured by protein phosphatase (PP2A) inhibition assays and by LC/MS/MS, respectively Nutrient values were high, with total inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 8.4mgL(-1) and from 0.03 to 1.37mgL(-1), respectively. However, the chlorophyll-a concentrations were very low with a peak (5.3 2 mu g L-1) on 20 September 2005 at 9 m depth water samples. Microscopic examination of the phytoplankton samples showed the dominance in the autumn of three morphospecies of the genus Microcystis and the species Oscillatoria tenuis. The total (particulate and dissolved) microcystin concentrations at the surface and at 9 m depth water samples ranged between 0.008 and 1.73, and 0.0005 and 5.57 mu g microcystin (MC)-LR equivalent L-1, respectively, with a peak on 20 September. The presence of the microcystin synthetase genes (mcyA, -B, and -C) in the lysates of the three morphospecies of the genus Microcystis and the species O. tenuis indicated that these species were responsible for the microcystin production in this system. The analysis of the field cyanobacterial sample extract containing these species by LC/MS/MS revealed the presence of two microcystin variants: microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and microcystin-YR (MC-YR).

Differences in migratory behavior between age classes were examined in the Diaptomus leptopus population of Corbett Lake, British Columbia, during summer of 1963. Only the males of stages V and VI showed a significant vertical migration. Females of stages V and VI and copepodid stages I-IV showed diel changes in vertical distribution, but these were not consistent between samples. All 3 groups showed significant clumping in the vertical plane. The data suggest that the degree of aggregation in the vertical plane is related to population size. Some evidence for horizontal patchiness is also considered. The possibility that ontogenetic changes in migratory behavior provide new clues to the biological significance of vertical migration is emphasized.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1967	12	1					34	+		10.4319/lo.1967.12.1.0034	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1967.12.1.0034													WOS:A19679052800006

Alkalothermophilic Iron-Reducing Bacteria of the Goryachinsk Thermal Water Basin	MICROBIOLOGY												A study of iron-reducing prokaryotes that use the poorly crystalline mineral ferrihydrite as an electron acceptor revealed their widespread occurrence on the planet. However, the ability of iron reducers to develop under polyextreme conditions (at elevated values of pH and temperature) has not been previously demonstrated. To confirm the existence of alkalothermophilic iron reducers, we studied the water and sediment samples from the Goryachinsk nitrogen-rich thermal water basin. These springs are associated with young tectonic fractures in the Baikal rift zone; their water is characterized by low salinity, alkaline pH (8.8-9.2) and temperature of 53-55 degrees C. Enrichment cultures reducing synthesized ferrihydrite were obtained by adding this mineral to the water and sediment samples from the Goryachinsk thermal springs, followed by anaerobic incubation at 50 and 55 degrees C. The 16S rRNA gene profiling of the water and sediment samples and of the primary enrichment cultures revealed high taxonomic diversity, almost exclusively represented by bacterial taxa. Subsequent transfers with ferrihydrite and organic acids or hydrogen as electron donors resulted in stable enrichment cultures of organo- and lithotrophic alkalothermophilic iron reducers. Members of the genus Parvivirga, one of the first cultured representatives of the OPB41 group (now the order Anaerosomatales, phylum Actinomycetota), constituted 30 to 50% of the total abundance.

Egg ratio data for the most abundant species was accrued to evaluate the significance of the seasonal peaks of abundance observed for particular species. The high correlation between egg ratios and standing crops suggested that at least the major peaks were real and not the result of horizontal patchiness. No significant differences in the rotifer community or in the seasonal distribution were detected between the 2 collections. Apparent differences in the species composition could be attributed to more recent changes in rotifer systematics and to the more thorough sampling routine of the recent study. However, the 1974 data set showed a significant increase in the spring maximum standing crop of rotifers. This increase suggests a change in trophic condition which may have resulted from lakeshore development during the past 3 decades.																									1977	93	2					104	113																WOS:A1977FB75500002

Urbanization, agricultural and industrial development have led to increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) discharge, which affect CHAB potentials of receiving waters. The amounts, proportions and chemical composition of N and P sources can influence the composition, magnitude and duration of blooms. This, in turn, has ramifications for food web dynamics (toxic or inedible CHABs), nutrient and oxygen cycling and nutrient budgets. Some CHABs are capable of N-2 fixation, a process that can influence N availability and budgets. Certain invasive N-2 fixing taxa (e.g., Cylindrospermopsis, Lyngbya) also effectively compete for fixed N during spring, N-enriched runoff periods, while they use N2 fixation to supplant their N needs during N-deplete summer months. Control of these taxa is strongly dependent on P supply. However, additional factors, such as molar N:P supply ratios, organic matter availability, light attenuation, freshwater discharge, flushing rates (residence time) and water column stability play interactive roles in determining CHAB composition (i.e. N-2 fixing vs. non-N-2 fixing taxa) and biomass. Bloom potentials of nutrient-impacted waters are sensitive to water residence (or flushing) time, temperatures (preference for >15 degrees C), vertical mixing and turbidity. These physical forcing features can control absolute growth rates of bloom taxa. Human activities may affect "bottom up" physical-chemical modulators either directly, by controlling hydrologic, nutrient, sediment and toxic discharges, or indirectly, by influencing climate. Control and management of cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton blooms invariably includes nutrient input constraints, most often focused on N and/or P. While single nutrient input constraints may be effective in some water bodies, dual N and P input reductions are usually required for effective long-term control and management of blooms. In some systems where hydrologic manipulations (i.e., plentiful water supplies) are possible, reducing the water residence time by flushing and artificial mixing (along with nutrient input constraints) can be effective alternatives. Blooms that are not readily consumed and transferred up the food web will form a relatively large proportion of sedimented organic matter. This, in turn, will exacerbate sediment oxygen demand, and enhance the potential for oxygen depletion and release of nutrients back to the water column. This scenario is particularly problematic in long-residence time (i.e., months) systems, where blooms may exert a strong positive feedback on future events.

These data sets were subsampled in various ways to determine how the precision of estimates of ice-free season phytoplankton photosynthesis was affected by sampling frequency. Deviations were as large as 20% if a measurement was not taken before thermal stratification was established in the spring, or if samples were taken at monthly intervals during the ice-free season. Shorter sampling intervals (1, 2, and 3 wk were tested) all resulted in deviations of about 10%. Taking samples irregularly (every day for the 3 d subsequent to rainfall events greater than or equal to 5 mm) instead of at regular time intervals did not reduce deviations.																			0706-652X					DEC	1994	51	12					2734	2738		10.1139/f94-274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-274													WOS:A1994RD71800012

This study focuses on St. Lawrence Island, where over the last two decades, 771 of 3,271 lakes have drained-a rate around 40 times higher than across the entire northern permafrost region. The surge in lake drainage began in 2018, coinciding with record low sea ice extent in the Bering Sea and unprecedented bird mortalities. Using satellite imagery and machine learning methods, we analyzed drainage events to identify the climatic drivers and potential climate thresholds affecting the island's lake ecosystems. Our findings indicate that autumn peak temperatures above 6 degrees C more than triple the drainage probability, and warming-induced permafrost thawing may be the direct driver of lake drainage. This research highlights the vulnerability of Arctic lake ecosystems to climate change and assists in developing predictive models for permafrost response, crucial for mitigating impacts on Arctic communities.

The seasonal oxygen isotope signal preserved in an ice core from Law Dome (66 degrees 44'S, 112 degrees 50'E), Antarctica, revealed a high-resolution summer temperature record for the same time period. The two proxies show highly correlated behaviour despite having significantly different climatic response mechanisms and a large geographic separation. The correlation observed between proxies based on such differing processes and analytical methodologies provides not only a climate record for the past similar to 650 years that is both robust and regionally representative of coastal East Antarctica but also confirmation of the utility of reconstructions using these methods.

Patterns of Selenium Distribution in Associated Media of the Lake Baikal Aquatic Ecosystem	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												A comparative analysis has been conducted on the distribution of selenium concentrations in the water of the associated media of the Lake Baikal ecosystem (surface and deep water of Lake Baikal, well water on Ol'khon Island and on the lake shore, water from numerous tributaries, cold and hot mineral springs, the source of the Angara River, and snowmelt). The Se indicator role reflects the deficiency of its concentrations in all aquatic components of the environment of the Baikal Region. The selenium content in the Baikal water media varies from 0.01 to 3.1 mu g/L. The median values are similar and lie within one or two orders of magnitude. Increased selenium contents are found in the water of wells and cold springs located in the Jurassic coal-bearing rocks and in the subalkaline granitoids of Ol'khon Island. We have established the potential chemical effect of snowmelt on the water at the source of the Angara River resulting in its increased concentrations of Se brought with the snow runoff from industrial areas of the Baikal Region. We believe that the strong continental climate, high seismic activity, and the peculiarities of the water currents in Lake Baikal contribute to the renewal of deep-seated water maintaining its geochemical composition and purity, despite the entry of selenium from man-made sources.

J	CRUMPTON, WG; WETZEL, RG				CRUMPTON, WG; WETZEL, RG			EFFECTS OF DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH AND MORTALITY IN THE SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON POPULATIONS IN LAWRENCE LAKE, MICHIGAN	ECOLOGY												Factors controlling algal succession in a small, oligotrophic lake during summer stratification were investigated. Phytoplankton population densities, growth rates, sedimentation losses, and mortality due to zooplankton grazing were measured weekly. Cyclotella michiganiana was the dominant alga through the end of June, at which time C. comensis began to increase, becoming the dominant by Aug. In Aug., high grazing pressure caused the rapid declines of both C. michiganiana and C. comensis, which were followed by an increase of Sphaerocystis schroeteri. The combined effect of greater growth rates and lower loss rates of C. comensis resulted in its dominance over C. michiganiana. In contrast, the C. comensis-S. schroeteri succession clearly resulted from differential mortality alone. Losses due to sedimentation and/or grazing apparently are important in many lakes and interspecific competition may be less important in actually controlling succession.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	6					1729	1739		10.2307/1940115	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940115													WOS:A1982PS51900015

Lake Skadar is the largest lake of the Balkan Peninsula, located along the Montenegro-Albanian border. The unique features of the lake and wide range of endemic, and rare or endangered plant and animal species, resulted in the classification of the Skadar as a wetland site of international significance. In spite of its importance, the lake is influenced by inflowing waters from the river Moraca and other regional rivers contaminated by the industry, Municipal and agricultural activities in the area. Therefore, the lake has been the Subject of various physical, chemical, biological and toxicological examinations. However, community-level analyses are most relevant to assess the effect of stressors on aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, bacteria] community structure among differently polluted sites of the lake was compared using a genetic fingerprinting technique. Methods. Water and sediment samples were collected from five differently polluted sampling sites on the Lake Skadar in spring and autumn of the same year. The bacterial community Structure in the samples was characterized and compared by temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Results and Discussion. The TTGE analysis resulted in man), distinguishable and reproducible band patterns, allowing a reliable comparison of bacterial communities among sampling sites. Results on the bacterial community structure revealed that three of the selected locations call be considered as sites that have not shown any pollution degradation determined by Our method, due to similar structure of a bacterial community in the sediment samples. Oil the other hand, significant shifts in the bacterial community structure in the mouth of the rivers Mora a and Plavnica were shown. Since the results coincide with some of the bioassays and chemical analysis performed previously, the changes in bacterial community structure are explained as an effect of antropogenic pollution oil the lake ecosystem by waters of the river Moraca and the stream Plavnica. Conclusion. The TTGE has proven to be an efficient and reliable method to monitor bacterial dynamics and community shifts in aquatic environments, especially in sediments. Within the variety of environmental quality assessments, the use of TTGE analyses from bacterial communities is strongly recommended, particularly as an initial investigation. However, in any conclusion on the state of the environment, the TTGE results should be combined to some other biological, chemical and hydrological data. Recommendation and Outlook. Since prokaryotes are a crucial group of organisms in the biosphere, the ecosystem function Studies are largely based oil bacterial communities. Therefore, bacterial community structure analysis should be a part of an integrated weight of evidence approach in pollution assessment. In case of Triad approach, consisting of chemical analyses, bioassays, and community studies in the field, the TTGE bacterial community structure analyses should be placed in the later Triad leg. In comparison to other community studies, based on various biotic indices, the TTGE bacterial community analysis has proven to be very sensitive, reliable and less time consuming.

Fish collection and environmental surveys were conducted in the summer of 2020 at five forest rivers and at the Ogaki Dam reservoir (an artificial lake) with different air dose rates (mean 0.20-3.32 mu Sv/h). From the river sites, two salmonid species (masu salmon and white-spotted charr) were sampled, with masu salmon generally exhibiting higher Cs-137 concentrations, ranging widely (10.6 Bq/kg-wet to 13.0 kBq/kg-wet) depending on the fish size (size effect) and site. The Cs-137 concentrations in masu salmon were explained by the air dose rates, Cs-137 concentrations in water, sediments (excluding the lake site), and primary producers, with site-specific variations. In the rivers, masu salmon (fluvial type with parr marks) mainly fed on terrestrial insects with higher Cs-137 concentrations compared with those of aquatic insects, indicating that Cs-137 was transferred mainly to fish through the allochthonous forest food-web during summer. In the lake, masu salmon (lake-run type with larger size and silvery body coloration) mainly preyed on smaller fish with lower Cs-137 concentrations, demonstrating that Cs-137 is transferred to fish through the autochthonous lake food-web with biomagnification. Differences in Cs-137 concentrations among masu salmon (mean 441 Bq/kg-wet) and other fish species (mean 74.8 Bq/kg-wet to 2.35 kBq/kg-wet) were also found in the lake. The distinct Cs-137 transfers to river and lake fish were supported by stable isotope analysis: delta N-15 and delta C-13 values enriched stepwisely through the food-webs were, respectively, higher and lower in the lake. Our results obtained using multiple approaches clearly revealed the distinct food-web transfer of Cs-137 in river and lake ecosystems. These findings can contribute to prediction of radioactive contamination in freshwater fish in the Fukushima evacuation zone.																			0265-931X	1879-1700				DEC	2024	280								107541	10.1016/j.jenvrad.2024.107541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2024.107541		SEP 2024						39317062					WOS:001321854600001

In the NP there are no human activities that could endanger its water systems. The preventive measures in protection of karst drinking water are necessary because of great vulnerability of karst aquifers to pollution. Different pollutants percolate into deep parts through fissures and pores; and complexity of karst flow systems is suitable for its spreading to wide areas. For the purpose of this examination the samples were taken at four springs (Velika Mocila, Cmo vrilo, Zanzibar and Strazbenica), two lakes in the pit Vodarica (Cmo and Bijelo jezero) and two creeks (Brezimenjaca and Velika Paklenica). From the few chosen parameters (pH-values, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, chlorides and sulphates) it was shown that the waters were of good quality at all sampling points except at the spring Velika Mocha, where an increased concentration of ammonium and a low level of oxygen were found. The results of conductivity, alkalinity and total hardness show different chemical composition of waters at the relatively small examination area, which is a consequence of different geological composition of the rocks in the NP, the time of retention and complexity of water flows in the karst.

The phosphorus content was highest in the most seriously polluted lake area. Iron-bound phosphorus (Fe(OOH)-P) dominated (47% on average) among the phosphorus fractions determined according to Golterman (Hydrobiologia 335:87-95, 1996). Notably, organically-bound P comprised a further significant additional portion (acid-soluble + hot NaOH-extractable organic P = 25%), which was highest at the most polluted sites. The Fe(OOH)-P content was the lowest in spring (April, 2004), suggesting that degradation of organic matter led to the release of iron-bound phosphates. Sediment APA showed a significant positive relationship with both organically-bound P and Fe(OOH)-P. Consequently, organically-bound P is an important portion of the sediment phosphorus in Lake Taihu. It is mainly derived from freshly-settled autochthonous particles and from external discharges. Organically-bound P induces APA and may lead to the release of bioavailable phosphates from the organic sediments, thereby accelerating lake eutrophication.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	599						119	125		10.1007/s10750-007-9185-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9185-z													WOS:000252890800015

Recruitment traps attached to the bottom were sampled weekly throughout the summer season (June through September). A comparison between the two sites shows that the largest part of the recruited cells originated from the shallow site, although recruitment occurred at all depths in the lake. There were also differences between the species, regarding the site as well as the timing of the recruitment. The contribution of the inoculum to the pelagic population was calculated to vary between 0.003% and 0.05% for the different species. From these results we conclude that shallow sediments are more important than deep ones for the recruitment and that the inoculum in Lake Limmaren is small but may still be an important factor in the population dynamics.																				1529-8817				OCT	2004	40	5					831	836		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2004.04070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2004.04070.x													WOS:000224179100005

Ice cover and thermal regime in a dimictic seepage lake under climate change	INLAND WATERS												Changes in water temperature and ice cover are important for controlling the biogeochemical and food-web processes of dimictic lakes in temperate regions. To investigate these changes, we applied a 1-dimensional hydrodynamic lake-ice model to Crystal Lake, a 20 m deep, dimictic seepage lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, to a period of 23 years (1989-2011). The model, DYRESM-WQ-I, incorporates the evolution of blue ice, white ice, and snow cover; time-varying ice and snow albedo; and 2-way coupling across the ice-water interface by incorporating components of previous ice models embedded in the hydrodynamic component of the DYRESM-WQ model. A new element of the current model is time-varying sediment heat fluxes, important to under-ice water temperatures in shallow lakes. Simulations closely reproduce the observed annual stratification regime and ice phenology with standard errors in temperature of 0.7 degrees C; total difference of 10-20% in ice thickness compared with measured values; and standard errors of 0.9 d for ice-on and 1.55 d for ice-off. Under a likely future climate scenario involving changes in air temperature forecasted to occur by the middle of this century (2055), results suggest an average reduction in mean ice cover thickness of about 0.18 m and an increase in surface mixed-layer temperature of up to 3.5 degrees C over summer. In addition, water levels decreased by 5.1 m over the simulation period, mostly in response to greater evaporation from higher surface water temperature in summer. The results have important implications for seepage lakes in temperate regions, where projected changes in precipitation with climate warming will not compensate for increased evaporation from the lake surface and the likely alteration in groundwater flows.

We assessed the impact of climate forcing by comparing the influence of stratification on oxygen, nutrients, and global warming potential (GWP) of greenhouse gases (the sum of CH4, CO2, and N2O in CO2 equivalents) emitted from a shallow productive lake during an average versus a heat-wave year. Strong stratification during the heat wave was accompanied by an algal bloom and chemically enhanced carbon uptake. Solar energy trapped at the surface created a colder, isolated hypolimnion, resulting in lower ebullition and overall lower GWP during the hotter-than-average year. Furthermore, the dominant CH4 emission pathway shifted from ebullition to diffusion, with CH4 being produced at surprisingly high rates from sediments (1.2-4.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Accumulated gases trapped in the hypolimnion during the heat wave resulted in a peak efflux to the atmosphere during fall overturn when 70% of total emissions were released, with littoral zones acting as a hot spot. The impact of climate warming on the GWP of shallow lakes is a more complex interplay of phytoplankton dynamics, emission pathways, thermal structure, and chemical conditions, as well as seasonal and spatial variability, than previously reported.

The well-exposed Sangyuan outcrop in the north-west of Luanping Basin in the Bohai Bay area, as a major hyperpycnal flow sedimentation sequence, is selected in this research to study its sedimentary architecture and stratigraphy in depth and propose a depositional model. Based on the sedimentary architecture and lithology, the Sangyuan outcrop can be divided into nine lithofacies and four facies associations. The four facie lithofacies represent process of strong erosion by the bedload dominated hyperpycnal flows, as well as the process of transitional deposition, controlled by both the bedload and suspended-load dominated hyperpycnal flows, and finally process of deposition by the suspended-load dominated hyperpycnal flows. Moreover, a larger amounts of the sediments are deposited near the source by the hyperpycnal flows. Unlike the coarse sediments, the fine-grain sediments, deposited on the less steep slope of the shelf, are not considered as the main product of deposition by the hyperpycnal flow. Furthermore, based on the sequence stratigraphy concept, we divide the Sangyuan outcrop into 15 parasequences and 3 parasequence sets. Through a detailed study of stratigraphic patterns and sand body thicknesses in the Sangyuan outcrop, a cycle of lake level rise-fall-rise is identified. The lake level fluctuation has controlled the distribution and characteristics of sediments. The results indicate that the thick and coarse sediments are easy to form, during the lake level falling period, by the hyperpycnal flows. All of the findings propose a new guideline for the exploration of new hydrocarbon reservoirs, deposited by the hyperpycnal flow.

J	MARSH, PC; PAPOULIAS, D				MARSH, PC; PAPOULIAS, D			ICHTHYOPLANKTON OF LAKE HAVASU, A COLORADO RIVER IMPOUNDMENT, ARIZONA-CALIFORNIA	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Eight fish species representing six families were identified among ichthyoplankton samples taken from Lake Havasu, Arizona-California, during springs of 1985 and 1986. Threadfin shad, Dorosoma petenense; common carp, Cyprinus carpio, and sunfishes, Lepomis spp., were predominant, with fewer numbers of razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus; black crapple, Pomoxis nigromaculatus; largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; and striped bass, Monroe saxatilis. Although the razorback sucker reproduces upstream in Lake Mohave, larvae captured during this study constitutes the first evidence of spawning by this species in Lake Havasu since the 1950s.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				APR	1989	75	2					68	73																WOS:A1989AR75100001

Diel activity patterns of the fish community in a temperate stream	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diel activity patterns of fishes in a temperate New Brunswick stream were studied during the summer over 5 years. Young-of-the year Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and blacknose dace Rhinichthys atratulus were more active during the day than at night, whereas lake chub Couesius plumbeus, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and adult white suckers Catostomus commersonii were more active at night than during the day. Because fishes were as likely to be nocturnal as diurnal, the data suggest that more night-time sampling is needed to provide an unbiased view of fish community structure in temperate streams.

In addition, every snowfall event during the winter of 1993 was collected on a single lake near the center of the transect. Across the transect, midwestern sources appear to dominate Pb and Cd concentrations, while Sb appears to be derived from midwestern sources as well as local and/or industrial East Coast sources. In all samples, the highest Na, Cl and Mg concentrations reflect a marine influence, but at some transect sites roadspray aerosol appears to contribute to Na and Cl concentrations. The regional pattern of Ca, K, Mn and Sr concentrations and Mn/Sr ratios indicate that woodsmoke may be an important winter source of these elements at some sites. In all samples, H+ is strongly correlated with NO3- (R(2) = 0.97) and mean NO3-/SO42- molar ratios of 6.4 for transect samples, and 4.7 for temporal samples, are higher than mean NO3-/SO42- reported for other precipitation studies in the same region. The contribution of NO3- to the snowpack greatly exceeds that of SO42-, and may be a major source of acidity in aquatic ecosystems during snowmelt.					Baisden, Troy/B-9831-2008; Baisden, W.

(COPEPODA, CALANOIDA) DURING SUMMER IN A SHALLOW LAKE (BALATON, HUNGARY)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Population structure and production of E. gracilis (G.O. Sars) were calculated from daily measurements in Lake Balaton for 1 mo. during each summer in 1975 and 1977. Fecundity was different in the 2 yr, 6.98 .+-. 1.16 and 10.68 .+-. 1.42 in 1975 and 1977, respectively. A total of 80 and 64% of the population were made up of larvae in 1975 and 1977, respectively. The ratio of males to females was 1:1.63 and 1:1.1, respectively. In 1975 it was possible to follow the development of cohorts, 19-20 days in the former year, 17-20 days in the latter. In both years of examination 80-83% of nauplii and 12-15% of copepodites were eliminated. Daily net biomass production was 6.88 mg (dry wt)/m3 in 1975 and 1.94 mg (dry wt)/m3 in 1977. Ratios of eggs, nauplii and copepodites in daily production was 1:2.4:1.4 in 1975 and 1:1.0:1.0 in 1977. The daily potential biomass production were 34.40 mg (dry wt)/m3 and 10.28 mg (dry wt)/m3 and the elimination was 80 and 81 wt%, respectively. P/B ratio, allowing for net production values, was nearly the same in both periods of investigation (0.12 and 0.099, respectively).																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1982	4	4					913	926		10.1093/plankt/4.4.913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/4.4.913													WOS:A1982PS26600009
J	Hrustic, E; Bobanovic-Colic, S				Hrustic, Enis; Bobanovic-Colic, Svjetlana			Hypoxia in deep waters of moderately eutrophic marine lakes, Island of Mljet, eastern Adriatic Sea	SCIENTIA MARINA												In this study, we explored the impact of eutrophication and stratification on hypoxia in deep waters of moderately warm Croatian marine lakes. Although the Mljet Lakes (MLs) are predominantly oligotrophic, mesotrophic conditions are present at depths below 20 m in the Small Lake (SL) and below 30 m in the Big Lake (BL), along with higher apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). Hypoxia at depths >= 25 m in SL and and >= 40 m in BL was observed between October 2009 and January 2010, and in SL in summer (July and September 2010). Significant differences (p< 0.05) in several physical, biological and chemical parameters were detected between the lakes, while AOU, derived oxygen utilization rate (OUR) and organic carbon remineralization rate (OCRR) were not significantly different (p> 0.05) between the lakes. An intense and persistent pycnocline throughout the year, comparatively high water temperature, extended water renewal time and summer phytoplankton bloom were identified as physical and biological parameters which might have significantly contributed to increased frequency of hypoxic events in a shallow SL. Significantly (p< 0.05) higher ammonium concentration in SL, especially in its deep water, seems to be a long-term chemical feature related to the poor ventilation and higher sediment oxygen demand. At the current level of eutrophication and the present climate change trends, the MLs and similar systems may experience more persistent and intense stratification, which could further prevent mixing between upper and deep waters, likely leading to increasing duration of hypoxia and its negative impacts on the biodiversity of benthic communities.

High mountain lakes are a network of sentinels, sensitive to any events occurring within their waterbodies, their surrounding catchments and their airsheds. By modifying nutrient balance and availability in water, both local and global changes are expected to alter primary productivity and to trigger strong ecological impacts in these ecosystems. 2. Predicting ecological trajectories under future change is a key challenge for both scientists and conservation managers. French alpine lakes, in the most southern and western part of the European Alps, have received surprisingly little attention to date. In this article, we address how variations in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply are likely to impact the area's phytoplankton growth. We performed N and/or P enrichment microcosm experiments under controlled conditions on 12 phytoplankton assemblages sampled during the summer 2016 in four French alpine lakes with contrasting catchments and N-deposition regimes. 3. The nutrients limiting phytoplankton growth varied according to the nutrient stoichiometry of the lake water. In the lakes exposed to high N-deposition rates 0700 kg N km(2) year 1 ), the water contained more N than P and phytoplankton growth in microcosms was either limited by P or not limited by either N or P. In the lakes exposed to low N-deposition rates 0500 kg N km(2) year 1 ), N availability relative to P was lower in the lake with vegetated catchment than in the lake with rocky catchment, resulting in a switch from P to NP colimitation of the phytoplankton in microcosms. 4. Our data clearly indicate that French alpine lakes do not host the same diversity and structure of phytoplankton communities and that phytoplankton composition influenced phytoplankton growth in microcosms. First, we show that nonmotile colonial chlorophytes appeared in late summer assemblages, with lower growth rates but P-storage abilities. Second, our findings indicate that the growth of phytoplankton assemblages dominated by diatoms was increasingly limited by silica (SiO2) throughout the summer, along with a 70% decrease in SiO2 concentration in lake water. 5. The forecast global changes in the French Alps should increase phytoplankton growth in most high mountain lakes where P is the main limiting nutrient, before NP colimitation. These changes are likely to be of lesser extent in lakes with large vegetated catchments in the northern area with lower N-deposition rates and of greater extent in the southern area with higher N-deposition rates and future P-deposition rates. 6. By investigating the relationship between nutrient availability, phytoplankton composition and phytoplankton growth rate, this experimental laboratory microcosm study will help interpret current multifactorial data from in situ monitoring networks in the Alps. It will also be helpful to develop models to better predict the sentinel lake responses to local and global changes.

However, when a great fraction of phylotypes is captured within a sample, application of alpha diversity measures is also possible, enabling the exploration of structural changes in prokaryotic communities. In the present study, phylotype-abundance data of Archaea and Bacteria were compiled from previous works on freshwater, thermal springs, and submarine mud volcanoes in Eastern Mediterranean region. Samples within each environment were used as pseudo-replicates to enable comparisons between the two assemblages (Archaea and Bacteria) and among different environments whereas sampling effort was found similar among samples using rarefaction curves. Phylotypes were defined as 16S rRNA sequences with 98% similarity. The most common diversity indices were calculated and relative abundance distributions (RADs) were employed to provide a more detailed interpretation of observed diversity patterns. The freshwater and mud volcanoes environments were the most diverse with respect to Bacteria but the least diverse considering Archaea, whereas thermal springs yielded very similar diversity for both assemblages. Overall, bacterial diversity was higher than archaeal with respect to richness and evenness since Archaea were characterized by high dominance and phylotype-poor distributions. The present comparative analysis of alpha diversity may offer useful insights into ecological processes shaping prokaryotic community structure, however equal sampling effort among different environments must be verified prior to analysis.

Tracing thermal aquifers of El Chichon volcano-hydrothermal (Mexico) with 87Sr/86Sr, Ca/Sr and REE	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The volcano-hydrothermal system of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico, is characterized by numerous thermal manifestations including an acid lake, steam vents and boiling springs in the crater and acid and neutral hot springs and steaming ground on the flanks. Previous research on major element chemistry reveals that thermal waters of El Chichon can be divided in two groups: (1) neutral waters discharging in the crater and southern slopes of the volcano with chloride content ranging from 1500 to 2200 mg/l and (2) acid-to-neutral waters with Cl up to 12,000 mg/l discharging at the western slopes. Our work supports the concept that each group of waters is derived from a separate aquifer (Aq. 1 and Aq. 2). In this study we apply Sr isotopes, Ca/Sr ratios and REE abundances along with the major and trace element water chemistry in order to discriminate and characterize these two aquifers. Waters derived from Aq. 1 are characterized by Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.70407 to 0.70419, while Sr concentrations range from 0.1 to 4 mg/l and Ca/Sr weight ratios from 90 to 180, close to average values for the erupted rocks. Waters derived from Aq. 2 have Sr-87/Sr-86 between 0.70531 and 0.70542, high Sr concentrations up to 80 mg/l, and Ca/Sr ratio of 17-28. Aquifer 1 is most probably shallow, composed of volcanic rocks and situated beneath the crater, within the volcano edifice. Aquifer 2 may be situated at greater depth in sedimentary rocks and by some way connected to the regional oil-gas field brines. The relative water output (Vs) from both aquifers can be estimated as Aq. 1/Aq. 2-30. Both aquifers are not distinguishable by their REE patterns. The total concentration of REE, however, strongly depends on the acidity. All neutral waters including high-salinity waters from Aq. 2 have very low total REE concentrations (<0.6 mu g/l) and are characterized by a depletion in LREE relative to El Chichon volcanic rock, while acid waters from the crater lake (Aq. 1) and acid AS springs (Aq. 2) have parallel profile with total REE concentration from 9 to 98 mu g/l. The highest REE concentration (207 mu g/l) is observed in slightly acid shallow cold Ca-SO4 ground waters draining fresh and old pyroclastic deposits rich in magmatic anhydrite. It is suggested that the main mechanism controlling the concentration of REE in waters of El Chichon is the acidity. As low pH results from the shallow oxidation of H2S contained in hydrothermal vapors, REE distribution in thermal waters reflects the dissolution of volcanic rocks close to the surface or lake sediments as is the case for the crater lake.

The Rise and Fall of Winaymarka: Rethinking Cultural and Environmental Interactions in the Southern Basin of Lake Titicaca	HUMAN ECOLOGY												Investigations of how past human societies managed during times of major climate change can inform our understanding of potential human responses to ongoing environmental change. In this study, we evaluate the impact of environmental variation on human communities over the last four millennia in the southern Lake Titicaca basin of the Andes, known as Lake Winaymarka. Refined paleoenvironmental reconstructions from new diatom-based reconstructions of lake level together with archaeological evidence of animal and plant resource use from sites on the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia, reveal frequent climate and lake-level changes within major cultural phases. We posit that climate fluctuations alone do not explain major past social and political transformations but instead that a highly dynamic environment contributed to the development of flexible and diverse subsistence practices by the communities in the Titicaca Basin.					; Bruno, Maria/L-2861-2017; Capriles, José/X-4990-2019	Domic Rivadeneira, Alejandra Iboya/0000-0003-0762-3967; 													0300-7839	1572-9915				APR	2021	49	2					131	145		10.1007/s10745-021-00222-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-021-00222-3		MAR 2021											WOS:000627200000001

A 2D modelling study of sedimentation, fluid flow and heat flow in the Baikal rift basin undergoing flank uplift and basin subsidence has been performed in order to understand the impact of these processes on the surface heat flow and hydrothermal anomalies. The BASIN-code applied for the simulation allows for a topographically and compaction driven fluid flow coupled to heat transfer. The regional fluid circulation is an effective mechanism of heat redistribution when velocities in the basement are larger than several cm/yr. It reduces the heat flow in the flanks and increases the heat flow over the basin; heat is brought from the flanks towards the basin area, with largest fluid flow at a depth of 1-2 km at both sides. The maximum computed heat fluxes are smaller than that measured in the heat flow anomalies. Nevertheless, the model suggests that fluid flow in the sedimentary basin combined with a topographically driven heat advection in the surrounding basement is a sufficient mechanism to account for the increased heat flow within the basin and the main features of the hot springs distribution.

Columbus crater and other possible groundwater-fed paleolakes of Terra Sirenum, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Columbus crater in the Terra Sirenum region of the Martian southern highlands contains light-toned layered deposits with interbedded sulfate and phyllosilicate minerals, a rare occurrence on Mars. Here we investigate in detail the morphology, thermophysical properties, mineralogy, and stratigraphy of these deposits; explore their regional context; and interpret the crater's aqueous history. Hydrated mineral-bearing deposits occupy a discrete ring around the walls of Columbus crater and are also exposed beneath younger materials, possibly lava flows, on its floor. Widespread minerals identified in the crater include gypsum, polyhydrated and monohydrated Mg/Fe-sulfates, and kaolinite; localized deposits consistent with montmorillonite, Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, jarosite, alunite, and crystalline ferric oxide or hydroxide are also detected. Thermal emission spectra suggest abundances of these minerals in the tens of percent range. Other craters in northwest Terra Sirenum also contain layered deposits and Al/Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, but sulfates have so far been found only in Columbus and Cross craters. The region's intercrater plains contain scattered exposures of Al-phyllosilicates and one isolated mound with opaline silica, in addition to more common Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates with chlorides. A Late Noachian age is estimated for the aqueous deposits in Columbus, coinciding with a period of inferred groundwater upwelling and evaporation, which (according to model results reported here) could have formed evaporites in Columbus and other craters in Terra Sirenum. Hypotheses for the origin of these deposits include groundwater cementation of crater-filling sediments and/or direct precipitation from subaerial springs or in a deep (similar to 900 m) paleolake. Especially under the deep lake scenario, which we prefer, chemical gradients in Columbus crater may have created a habitable environment at this location on early Mars. Citation: Wray, J. J., et al.

Tibetan geothermal systems, recognized for their CMR potential, have not yet been systematically evaluated. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the spatial distributions, resource flux, reserves, and resource effects of CMRs, integrating and analyzing hydrochemical and discharge flow rate data. Geochemical findings reveal significant enrichment of lithium (Li), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and boron (B) in the spring waters and sediments, primarily located along the Yarlung Zangbo suture and north-south rift zones. Resource flux estimates include approximately 246 tons of Li, 54 tons of Rb, 233 tons of Cs, and 2747 tons of B per year, underscoring the mineral potential of the geothermal spring waters. Additionally, over 40,000 tons of Cs reserves are preserved in siliceous sinters in Tagejia, Gulu, and Semi. The Tibetan geothermal systems thus demonstrate considerable potential for CMRs, especially Cs, through stable discharge and widespread distribution, also serving as indicators for endogenous mineral exploration and providing potential sources for lithium in exogenous salt lakes. This study evaluates the CMR potential of the Tibetan geothermal systems, advancing CMR exploration while contributing to the future security of CMR supplies.

A 17,000-year multi-proxy study of the Indian Summer Monsoon from Lake Dian, Yunnan, China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Continuous lacustrine records of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) that span the Pleistocene-Holocene transition to the present are relatively rare, yet crucial to providing context to future changes in hydroclimate. We summarize here a 17,000 year continuous multi-proxy record of hydroclimate and primary productivity from Lake Dian in the central Yunnan Province of China. Analysis of sediment composition, opal, carbon to nitrogen ratios, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, and magnetic susceptibility (MS) are used to identify four distinct units in the sediment record. Unit I sediments from 17,000 to 11,500 years BP are characterized by high MS and uniformly low organic and opal content interrupted by a decrease in MS during the Bolling-Allerod indicating the influence of the North Atlantic on the ISM. We interpret this to reflect cold, dry, and windy conditions during the transition out of the Last Glacial Maximum. Unit II from 11,500 to 5000 years BP is marked by a pronounced decrease in MS, increase in opal, and decrease in delta C-13(org) of organic carbon driven by peak warmth and wet conditions increasing productivity. Unit III from 5000 to 1800 years BP shows further increases in primary productivity, marked by lower carbon to nitrogen ratios and carbonate precipitation, possibly driven by a drop in lake level. A period of aridity is in wide agreement with a number of other records from the region. Unit IV from 1800 years BP to present is dominated by anthropogenic impacts and hallmark signs of catchment soil erosion and cultural eutrophication. Our interpretations of the Dian sediment record agree well with previous palynological work and add a new dimension to our understanding of lake hydrology and productivity over the past 17,000 years.

J	VERDUIN, J				VERDUIN, J			COMPARISON OF SPRING DIATOM CROPS OF WESTERN LAKE ERIE IN 1949 AND 1950	ECOLOGY												A comparison of the 1949 and 1950 spring diatom crops in western Lake Erie showed that the 1949 yield was 12 times greater than the 1950 yield. The difference was largely attrivuted to the greater extent of turbid water (apparently injected by rivers) in the western basin during 1950. The 1950 pulse occurred a month later than in 1949, and a comparison of light and temperature data suggests that cloudy weather may have retarded the pulse. Six datum points on the 1950 growth curve indicated a fairly constant growth rate, amounting to a doubling of the population every 7 days. The euphotic zone in turbid areas represented about one-fourth of the water column; this condition severely inhibited growth. The euphotic zone in the clear areas represented one-half or more of the water column; this condition permitted development of large populations. The ash-free dry weight of suspended materials in turbid water (3 mg./l.) was almost as large as that of the 1949 crop (4.8 mg. /l.) but much of the suspended matter in turbid water does not settle out in the western basin, as diatoms apparently do, so it does not become available to the same group of organisms. This kind of yield study is an essential first step in a study of food chains in aquatic environments.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1951	32	4					662	668		10.2307/1932732	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932732													WOS:A1951XW60800006

In Italy, this category includes all the large coastal cities (such as Venice, Naples, Cagliari or Palermo) or those crossed by large rivers (Bologna, Florence, Rome), the centers that have sprung up on the edges of large lakes (Riva del Garda, Bolsena, Bracciano, etc. ) or those known because they are linked to the presence of hot springs (Saturnia, Montecatini, Fiuggi Acqui, etc.), but also the localities that bear precisely the title of "water village" and thus make it a distinctive and characteristic element. It is precisely these small and charming villages, hamlets of municipalities in inland areas, scattered in the various regions of Italy that over time have been able to enhance water both as a landscape element but also as an element of production and economic development, that are the subject of this contribution. Among these, the cases of Rasiglia and Borghetto will be analyzed to describe the role that technology in the past has played in building the relationship of these localities with water, the role it has today and could have in the next future to contribute to their path toward building a circular economy and thus sustainable development.																			2035-8792	2281-7549					2024	3						439	461		10.19246/DOCUGEO2281-7549/202403_22	http://dx.doi.org/10.19246/DOCUGEO2281-7549/202403_22													WOS:001432486900018

Initial indications of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure in Saskatchewan common loons	FACETS												Mercury (Hg) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are global pollutants known for their toxicity to wildlife. Because of their trophic position, common loons (Gavia immer (Brunnich 1764)) are excellent indicators of environmental quality. In 2014 and 2015, tissue samples of ten adult common loons (plus one recapture) were obtained in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan, and assessed for Hg and PAH exposure. Blood and feather levels of these contaminants are indicative of exposure during breeding and in wintering areas, respectively. Compared with an international Hg database, blood Hg levels were low (<1 mu g/g). In most loons (90.5%, 10 out of 11), blood PAH concentrations were also low (<10 ng/g), but high (120 ng/g) for one individual (9.5% 1 out of 11). Feather PAH concentrations were high (95.9 ng/g and 250.6 ng/g) in two of the four loons (50%) caught in 2015. These data indicate that loons breeding in Meadow Lake Provincial Park were exposed to low levels of Hg; however, some individuals are being exposed to PAHs in both their breeding and wintering locations. The effect of these environmental pollutants on individual loon fitness is unclear, but because of their extreme toxicity in biological systems we suggest that future monitoring in the surrounding region is warranted.																			2371-1671					SEP 6	2018	3						849	857		10.1139/facets-2018-0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/facets-2018-0009													WOS:000444006500001

Playas Valley and neighboring basins supported pluvial lakes during full and/or late glacial times. Plant macrofossil and pollen assemblages from nine middens in the Playas Valley allow comparisons of two time intervals: 16,000-10,000 and 4000-0 (14)C yr B.P. Vegetation along pluvial lake margins consisted of open pinyon-juniper communities dominated by Pinus edulis, Juniperus scopulorum, Juniperus cf. coahuilensis, and a rich understory of C(4) annuals and grasses. This summer-flowering understory is also characteristic of modem desert grassland in the Borderlands and indicates at least moderate summer precipitation. P. edulis and J. scopulorum disappeared or were rare in the midden record by 10,670 (14)C yr B.P. The late Holocene is marked by the arrival of Chihuahuan desert scrub elements and few departures as the vegetation gradually became modem in character. Larrea tridentata appears as late as 2190 (14)C yr B.P. based on macrofossils, but may have been present as early as 4095 (14)C yr B.P. based on pollen. Fouquieria splendens, one of the dominant desert species present at the site today, makes its first appearance only in the last millennium. The midden pollen assemblages are difficult to interpret; they lack modern analogs in surface pollen assemblages from stock tanks at different elevations in the Borderlands.

J	Williams, JW; Shuman, BN; Webb, T III				Williams, JW; Shuman, BN; Webb, T III			Dissimilarity analyses of late-Quaternary vegetation and climate in eastern North America	ECOLOGY												Plant formations different from any extant today apparently were widespread in North America and Europe during the last deglaciation. produced by the independent biogeographic responses of plant taxa to climate change. Dissimilarity analyses of modern and fossil pollen samples in eastern North America show that the unique plant associations centered around the Great Lakes at 14 000 calendar years before present (yr BP), with high dissimilarities during 17 000-12 000 yr BP The late-glacial fossil pollen assemblages are characterized by (1) high abundances of boreal conifers such as spruce and larch relative to their Holocene values. (2) high abundances of herbaceous types (sedge, sage, and ragweed), (3) high abundances of broad-leaved deciduous types (ash, hornbeam, poplar, hazel. and willow), and (4) the low abundance or absence of pine, alder, and birch. When the fossil pollen samples are assigned to biomes using the affinity score technique, the late Pleistocene pollen samples are assigned to mixed parkland, a biome that is not extant in North America today. The fastest vegetational changes occurred 13 000-11 000 yr BP, when the late Pleistocene vegetation reorganized into the Holocene biomes, which have persisted to today. Simulations by the Community Climate Model, version I (CCM 1), suggest that late-glacial climates were also unlike modern climates. featuring a "hypercontinental" mixture of colder-than-present winters, warmer-than-present summers, and lower-than-present precipitation. Dissimilarity analyses of the pollen data and CCMI simulations for 21 000. 16 000, 14 000, 11 000, and 6000 yr BP show that (1) the temporal and spatial distribution of high dissimilarities in the vegetation (relative to present) coincide with dissimilarities in simulated climate, (2) the timing and spatial distribution of changes in the vegetation and simulated climate also agree, and (3) the largest climatic and vegetational changes follow the peak period of dissimilarity from present. Taken together, these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the no-analogue plant associations were in equilibrium with orbital- and millennial-scale climate change. Nonclimatic factors such as low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the presence of now-extinct megafauna species may have increased the openness of the Pleistocene vegetation, but by themselves cannot explain the observed mixture of boreal, temperate, and herbaceous taxa in the no-analogue pollen assemblages, nor can they explain the prevalence of no-analogue pollen samples during the late glacial period.					; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024	Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	2001	82	12					3346	3362																WOS:000172791800007

The following winter was anomalously wet in the Levant, with a similar to 2-m increase in the Dead Sea level that created a distinct morphological terrace along the lake's shore. Given the global radiative and chemical effects of volcanogenic aerosols on climatic systems, we tested the hypothesis that the 1991-92 winter shore terrace is a modern analogue to the linkage between past volcanic eruptions and a sequence of shore terraces on the cliffs around the Dead Sea Basin (DSB). Sixteen shore terraces, detected using airborne laser scanning data, were interpreted as indicating short-term level rises due to episodes of enhanced precipitation and runoff during the dramatic drop in Lake Lisan's (palaeo-Dead Sea) level at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. The terraces were compared with a dated time series of volcanogenic sulfate from the GISP2 ice core, and similar numbers of sulfate concentration peaks and shore terraces were found. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between SO4 concentration peaks and the heights of the terraces. This correlation may indicate a link between the explosivity of past eruptions, the magnitude of stratospheric injection, and their impact on the northern hemisphere water balance. The record of such short-term climato-hydrological effects is made possible by the dramatic desiccation of Lake Lisan. Detailed records of such events, albeit rare because of their vulnerability and short longevity, provide an important demonstration of global climatic teleconnections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

By the late 1970s, the tephra had been mapped across tens of thousands of square kilometres, traced to its source on Long Island in the Bismarck Sea, and linked to pyroclastic density currents in the Matapun Beds on the island. With a tephra fall volume >10 km(3), this eruption was clearly one of the 10 largest globally in the past 600 years. Although almost certainly in the AD 17th or 18th centuries, determining just when this VEI 6 eruption occurred has proved difficult. Whether this eruption occurred before or after William Dampier sailed past, named, described and drew a profile of Long Island has been debated also. Dating the Long Island eruption has implications for assessing the rate of revegetation of the island, recolonisation of the island and caldera lake, Jared Diamond's theory of supertramp' birds, correlations between major eruptions and ice core chronologies, the constant rate of supply model of Pb-210 concentration in lake sediments, reservoir effects in Lake Kutubu in the southern highlands of PNG, the timing of a prehistoric phase of agriculture in the Western Highlands and the longevity of oral histories recording a taim tudak (time of darkness) when sand fell from the sky, houses collapsed, crops were ruined and people died. This paper reviews early dates based on radiocarbon, Pb-210 and paleosecular magnetic variation, historical reports and genealogical dates from oral histories, and speculation based on tree ring and ice core evidence. Analyses of 10 new radiocarbon dates from the Matapun Beds on Long Island are reported. Our best estimate places the eruption between 1651 and 1671 AD with a 95.4% probability and between 1655 and 1665 AD with a 68.2% probability.

Low water levels interact with reservoir aging to increase the severity of summertime metalimnion dissolved oxygen minima in Lake Powell, desert Southwest, USA	INLAND WATERS												Water level drawdowns are common in reservoirs and can affect dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics via several pathways. In large storage reservoirs, inflow deltas are often important sites for sediment deposition, with some sediment laden rivers forming highly dynamic delta regions as they enter the reservoir. As water levels change, deposited sediment may be remobilized and affect pelagic DO dynamics. Here, we analyze a long-term set of DO profiles to ask how water levels have interacted with both reservoir age and spring inflow volumes to affect metalimnion low DO events in Lake Powell, desert Southwest, USA. The most supported model suggests that declining water levels interact with reservoir age, such that an older and lower elevation reservoir leads to more metalimnion DO consumption, with larger spring snowmelt inflows furthering DO declines. We also conducted incubations to understand how sediment source, monsoon inputs, and water temperature affect DO demand and nutrient cycling. Incubation oxygen demand varied significantly by sediment source, exhibiting modest temperature dependence at the nonmonsoonal sites. We observed the highest oxygen demand from monsoonal inputs and substantial phosphorus release from 2 of 3 sediment types. Our findings emphasize how reservoir aging and hydrological dynamics can combine to reduce DO availability.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				DEC 31	2025	15	1							2476309	10.1080/20442041.2025.2476309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2025.2476309													WOS:001546088800001

In order to further comprehensively understand the global supply and demand pattern, development and utilization status, genesis of ore deposits and other characteristics of lithium resources, based on the achievements of many researchers at home and abroad, this paper systematically summarized the lithium supply and demand situation, resource endowment, deposit classification and distribution, typical geological characteristics, metallogenic factors and metallogenic regularity of terrestrial brine-type lithium deposits which are the main types of development and utilization all over the world. The review shows that brine-type lithium resource and (or) reserves in the plateau salt lakes are huge and play an important role. In addition, the mineralization potential of the underground brine-type lithium deposit is broad worldwide. The potential resources of underground brines are enormous, and the geothermal spring water type is also worthy of attention. Brine lithium deposits are mainly controlled by the subduction and collision of regional plate tectonics, arid climate and provenance conditions. Strengthening of the scientific research on underground brines in the future is expected to provide another significant support for the global demand for lithium resources.																			2096-5192					OCT 25	2024	8	1					1	25		10.31035/cg20230128	http://dx.doi.org/10.31035/cg20230128													WOS:001407634200001

Excitation wavelengths of 620 nm and 440 nm were used; the former for detecting the cyanobacteria themselves, and the latter for subtracting the interference due to eukaryotic algae present in the sample. The fluorescence of the cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae was measured at 645 nm and 680 nm, respectively. Applied to real samples from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, after ultrasonication, this fluorometric method is capable of the rapid determination of phycocyanin. We used this sensor system for monitoring surface water in Lake Kasumigaura in 9 months in laboratory experiments. Moreover, an automatic device based on this system was used for the continuous in situ monitoring of phycocyanin in lakewater. As expected, higher levels of phycocyanin due to cyanobacteria were observed, compared to chlorophyll a due to eukaryotic algae in summer.

Metazachlor and flufenacet are two common herbicides applied in fall (i.e., August-October) to agricultural fields in Northern Germany. High concentrations of these herbicides are often found in adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton are one of the highly susceptible non-targeted aquatic organismal groups for herbicides and effects on phytoplankton may initiate a chain of consequences in meta communities through trophic interactions. Few studies have focused on responses of the phytoplankton community for metazachlor and, no studies have focused on flufenacet. We studied the effects of metazachlor and flufenacet on the phytoplankton community by conducting a microcosm experiment exposing natural fall phytoplankton communities to environmentally realistic concentrations as 0 (control), 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g L-1 of metazachlor and flufenacet treatments over a 4-week period. We measured changes in density, composition (i.e., in phyla and species level), taxonomic diversity indices, and functional features of phytoplankton communities as a response to herbicides. A reduction in the density of Chlorophyta species (e.g., Koliella longiseta, Selenastrum bibraianum) and Cyanobacteria species (e.g., Merismopedia tenuissima and Aphanocapsa elegans) was observed in herbicide treatments compared to controls. The phytoplankton community shifted towards a high density of species from Bacillariophyta (e.g., Nitzschia fonticola and Cyclotella meneghiniana), Miozoa (i.e., Peridinium willei), and Euglenozoa (i.e., Trachelomonas volvocina) in herbicide treatments compared to controls. Metazachlor and flufenacet showed significant negative effects on taxonomic diversity indices (e.g., species richness, the Shannon-Wiener index) and functional features (e.g., functional dispersion and redundancy) of the phytoplankton communities, with increasing herbicide concentrations. Our study provides insights into direct, selective, and irrecoverable effects of metazachlor and flufenacet on phytoplankton communities in the short-term. The comprehensive understanding of these effects of environmentally realistic herbicide concentrations on aquatic biota is essential for a sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in agricultural areas.					; Riis, Tenna/AAE-4115-2020; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/C-6313-2011; Hölzel, Christina/KBB-1315-2024; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola Fohrer/C-6313-2011; Wijewardene, Lishani/AHE-1595-2022	Holzel, Christina Susanne/0000-0001-8540-5928; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/0000-0002-7456-6301; Wijewardene, Lishani/0000-0001-5586-3928; Riis, Tenna/0000-0003-2501-4444													0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 25	2021	228								113036	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113036		NOV 2021						34861440					WOS:000740121400005

However, major changes have occurred both in external nutrient loading and in the water column chemistry of the lake since the mid-1980's. Epilimnetic particulate nitrogen: particulate phosphorous (PN:PP) ratios have declined, and measurements of seston chemistry suggest that the intensity of seasonal nitrogen limitation has increased. The phytoplankton community also was altered in 1994 and 1995 by a lake-wide summer invasion of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum. This abrupt change in phytoplankton community structure is consistent with the development of conditions increasingly N-deficiency and P-sufficiency in the water column, which should favor cyanobacterial dominance.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1999	61	4					293	306		10.1007/PL00001326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001326													WOS:000085111500002

Glacial activity is sensitive to climate change in this area. However, due to high annual ablation and accumulation in this region, ice cores over long time scales are difficult to retrieve. In addition, reconstructed glacial activity from moraine dates is usually discontinuous. Here, we use a sediment core retrieved from Laigu Lake, which is a proglacial lake located in the headwaters of the Parlung Zangbo River, the largest tributary of the Brahmaputra River, to reflect glacial activities over the last-8000 years in this area. Samples of the sediment core were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, XRF (X-ray florescence) scanned elemental concentration and grain size. The results indicated that the magnetic susceptibility and CPS (peak area counts per second) of strontium (Sr) could be used as proxies for glacial activity. The CPS of Sr and the magnetic susceptibility were lower and the glacial activity was weak before 4.3 cal Ica BP. Expansion of the glaciers in this area.began from 4.3 cal ka BP and continued to develop after similar to 33 cal ka BP. From 2.2 cal ka BP to 1.6 cal ka BP, the glaciers retreated substantially, followed by another development period until the onset of modern global warming. Based on our findings and other climate records, we concluded that glacial activity in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau areas was mainly influenced by Northern Hemisphere temperatures and summer insolation over a sub-orbital time scale, but did not respond to the Indian monsoon.

J	Zhou, JC; Wu, JL; Zhang, HL				Zhou, Jianchao; Wu, Jinglu; Zhang, Hongliang			Changes of provenance of loess deposits in Nyingchi, southeastern Tibetan Plateau: Implications for paleoclimates since the last glacial	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Paleoenvironmental conditions on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the last glacial period are still unclear. Here, we present a loess record (LZP) in the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) valley of the southeastern TP, extending over the past 33 ka. Based on grain size, magnetic susceptibility, major and trace elements, sources of loess during different periods were discriminated. Combined with bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC and delta 13Corg), as well as comparisons to regional paleoclimate records, the paleoclimate and environmental impli-cations of the LZP loess were further revealed. During 33.4-24.5 ka and 8.4-0.5 ka, loess deposits were mainly derived from nearby river valley while undergoing a relatively strong Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The period of 24.5-15.4 ka witnessed a notable decrease in the contribution of nearby sources and an increase in the contribution of distant materials. The dramatic changes in loess provenance may be due to the development of a paleo-dammed lake in the YZR valley, coupled with the impact of a weak ISM. The sediment contribution of nearby sources increased during 15.4-8.4 ka due to shrinkage or disappearance of the paleo-dammed lake and enhanced ISM. Furthermore, four warmer and wetter events occurred at 31-29 ka, 26.8-25 ka, 22.3-21 ka and 15.5-14 ka were revealed by the LZP record and correspond to enhanced ISM. Our research indicates the complex responses of loess deposits in the southeastern TP to global climate change and local environmental events.

This study focuses on the first palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstruction of Pliocene and early Pleistocene coalbearing sequences cored in the two coal exploration wells (SK-1 and SK-2) using coal petrography, mineralogy, faunal (ostracod and mollusk), and floral (palynology and diatom) data from four coal seams (from bottom to top: B, A, X-1, and X-0) with the variable total thickness (1 to 7 m). According to the palynological data, warm and humid climate conditions prevailed during the early Pliocene, and the precursor peats of seams A and B were mainly accumulated under limno-telmatic conditions, with high contributions of herbaceous peat-forming plants. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of syngenetic carbonate minerals and framboidal pyrites along with calcareous fossil and diatom remains implies neutral to weakly alkaline conditions within palaeomires of these seams. Furthermore, ostracod and gastropod fauna from these seams might imply nutrient-rich shallow water conditions and spring support (e.g., karstic aquifer) into palaeomires. Thus, algal activity within the palaeomires was presumably high, and freshwater algae and diatoms were commonly identified in these seams.With the development of increased uplift ratio of central Taurides and climatic changes towards to late stages of Pliocene and particularly early Pleistocene, the common peat-forming plants within palaeomires and vegetation in the surrounding areas were changed. The increased precipitation caused an elevation of water levels in the study area; hence, the precursor peats of the seam X-1 were accumulated under wet forest mire conditions. This increase also explains the existence of ostracod and mollusk fauna related to river and spring support underlying sequences of the seam X-1. With the ceasing of accumulation of peat of the seam X-1, the climate became drier, and very shallow water conditions have been common. The development of spring support and relatively high precipitation in a short period of time allowed for final peat accumulation (seam X-0) during the early Pleistocene. Nevertheless, this period was followed by the development of relatively colder conditions in the study area, and cold small water conditions were developed during the end of the early Pleistocene. Furthermore, microthermic vegetation was common in the vicinity of the palaeomires during the early Pleistocene. Overall, the peat accumulation and water level of lakes in the study area seem to be controlled by climatic oscillations and uplift of margins of the Lake Beys,ehir Basin during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene.

Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya	NATURE												The nature of inter-group relations among prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains disputed, with arguments in favour and against the existence of warfare before the development of sedentary societies(1,2). Here we report on a case of inter-group violence towards a group of hunter-gatherers from Nataruk, west of Lake Turkana, which during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene period extended about 30 km beyond its present-day shore(3). Ten of the twelve articulated skeletons found at Nataruk show evidence of having died violently at the edge of a lagoon, into which some of the bodies fell. The remains from Nataruk are unique, preserved by the particular conditions of the lagoon with no evidence of deliberate burial. They offer a rare glimpse into the life and death of past foraging people, and evidence that warfare was part of the repertoire of inter-group relations among prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

SINKHOLES AND A DISAPPEARING LAKE: VICTORY LAKE CASE STUDY	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												Human-induced sinkhole collapse can result in drastic changes to landscape aesthetics and present challenges to land managers seeking to determine the plausibility of restoration, the amount of financial investment needed, and the long-term sustainability of tampering with karstic environments. Alteration of groundwater flow in a karstic environment expedited the formation of large sinkholes in the southern end of man-made Victory Lake, causing it to drain immediately. Soon after the lake emptied in 1986, two unsuccessful attempts were made to restore the 13 ha (32 ac) lake. The sinkholes formed in the southern basin were completely in-filled, eliminating 3 ha (8 ac) of lake basin and significantly altering the original lake morphology. Some twenty-seven years later, Victory Lake is holding some water in the shallow basin at the northern end and would primarily be classified as a marshy wetland. This study was initiated to investigate the current relationship between the groundwater and surface water at the lake's altered basin to determine the potential for it to be restored fully or partially as a recreational focal point of the Berry College campus. Over the course of one year we measured the inputs (stream flow and precipitation) and outputs (evaporation and surface water outflow) of the lake system. We were able to conclude that groundwater is not likely contributing to the lake, based on inorganic and stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) water chemistry analysis and the deep position of the groundwater table relative to the lake bottom. From the results of dye-tracer tests conducted in the lake, we concluded that basin water may not be escaping downward at measurable rates because of its clay bottom. Our overall water-budget analysis confirms an adequate water volume entering by rainfall and ephemeral stream inflow; nearly 90% of the water leaves Victory Lake through surface-water outflow. Water loss through evapotranspiration during spring and summer months overcomes the gain accomplished during wetter and cooler months, particularly February. Through an investigation of water level records kept for campus monitoring wells from 1998 through 2012 we confirm that the groundwater table has stabilized and the immediate threat of new sinkhole formation is minimal. Restoration of Victory Lake to its original picturesque meeting spot may be possible through creative engineering strategies and project financing. However, we question the longevity of managing a karstic environment and consider the potential risks to infrastructure, groundwater, and human health should lake bottom failure occur again on campus.																			1090-6924					DEC	2014	76	3					217	229		10.4311/2012ES0272	http://dx.doi.org/10.4311/2012ES0272													WOS:000348409500007

Little is known about the distribution and seasonal movement patterns of striped bass in Lewis Smith Reservoir. During a three-year period from 1999-2001, 22 striped bass were captured, surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and released back into the reservoir near their original capture site. Movement patterns of transmitter-equipped striped bass indicate that fish movement in the lake was dependent on fluctuations in seasonal temperature and water quality. During the critical summer months when the reservoir stratifies, striped bass tended to move downstream into cooler and deeper sections of the reservoir, taking advantage of lower water temperatures.																									2003							141	149																WOS:000228129800013
J	Gajewski, K; Hamilton, PB; McNeely, R				Gajewski, K; Hamilton, PB; McNeely, R			A high resolution proxy-climate record from an arctic lake with annually-laminated sediments on Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediments from a 3 ha lake (75 degrees 34.34'N, 89 degrees 18.55'W) from the coastal region of northern Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada, contain discrete laminations in the deepest part of the basin. The laminations are varves as indicated by the correspondence between counts and thickness measurements of the couplets and (210)Ppb dating. A 14 cm core representing 150 years of sedimentation contained laminated couplets consisting of a lighter inorganic layer with a higher percentage of calcium and magnesium, alternating with fine darker bands, typically more cohesive, and comprising higher proportions of silica and carbon. A reddish oxidation zone with higher iron and aluminum frequently separates the laminations. The dark layer represents a biogenic component deposited in summer and is made cohesive by bacterial filaments among the other particles. The light inorganic layer represents elastic deposition from allochthonous sources. Deposition rates were relatively consistent through the core with an increase in varve thickness in the 1950s. Diatom concentrations in the sediments increased by two orders of magnitude in this century, with major increases in the 1920s and 1950s. The increase in varve thickness and diatom abundance coincides with an increase in summer melt percentage in an ice core from the Devon Island Ice Cap (Koerner, 1977). The relatively high sedimentation rate (0.15 cm yr(-1)) coupled with the consistency of deposition makes this lake a significant indicator for recent climate changes of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

To do, sediment samples were collected from different depths in autumn 2015 using a Van Veen Grab. Phosphorus forms were recognized by a sequential extraction procedure (SEDEX). Results revealed that the range of total phosphorus (TP) was between 431 ppm and 594 ppm with a mean value of 535.25 +/- 45.05 ppm. Organic phosphorus (OP) ranged from 62 to 99 ppm and contributed 14.85 +/- 2.21% of total phosphorus in average. The contents of loosely phosphorus, iron-bound phosphorus, authigenic phosphorus and detrital phosphorus varied 35-55 ppm, 50-94 ppm, 125-189 ppm and 152-217 ppm, respectively. Generally, inorganic phosphorus (IP) was between 365 and 522 ppm which comprised 81.9-88.53% of total phosphorus. Findings showed levels of different phosphorus forms in a descending order: detrital P > Authigenic P > Organic P > Fe-P > Loosely P. Bioavailable phosphorus concentration was between 153 ppm and 240 ppm and consisted 37.21 +/- 3% of total phosphorus. Based on molar ratio of TOC/OP, organic matter obtained from the studied stations suggested a terrestrial origin.

Chloroform was analysed by liquid-liquid extraction, capillary gas chromatography followed by electron capture detection and confirmation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Maps of the regional variation of chloroform and sodium-lignin sulfonates (NaLS) show that under winter conditions with an inverse stratification the effluents of a pulp mill containing chloroform and NaLS fill the depressions of the lake bottom and flow as a thin, high-density waste water current downslope northeastward against the southward directed upper current of the epilimnion. Plots of chloroform against Ca indicate that there is only a weak net removal of chloroform from combined solution and suspension. Thus mass transfer to the atmosphere is confined in Lake Nasijarvi to seasons with vertical mixing of the water masses.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN	1986	48	1-2					123	132		10.1016/0048-9697(86)90158-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(86)90158-0													WOS:A1986AXG9500009

A wildfire burned through the area in Aug. The following spring the same quadrat was resurveyed to determine the 1st yr changes in bird populations. Species and guilds were compared by density, territorial space, existence energy and importance values. Twelve species had territories in the study grid before the fire [Dendroica castanea, D. fusca, Parus hudsonicus, Vireo olivaceus, Regulus calendula, V. solitarius, D. coronata, Certhia familiaris, Sitta canadensis, Catharus guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Troglodytes troglodytes]; six [V. olivaceus, V. solitarius, Sitta canadensis, C. guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, T. troglodytes] were not there the following spring, but 8 additional species [Nuttallornis borealis, Picoides arcticus, Catharsus minimus, C. ustulatus, Carpodacus purpureus, Turdus migratorious, Junco hyemalis and Zonotrichia albicollis] had established territories. Tree-foliage searchers had the greatest importance value before the fire and ground-brush foragers the greatest value afterwards. Density, total biomass, and combined existence energy of birds decreased after the fire by 50, 23 and 41%, respectively, but species using the area after the fire were 63% heavier on the average. Average energy consumption per unit of body weight was calculated to be 23% less after the fire. Fire apparently reduced the total food available for birds, but increased the kinds of food, especially at or near the ground.																				1938-5129					1981	83	4					347	354		10.2307/1367504	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367504													WOS:A1981MS45800009
J	Yang, FC; Shao, MQ; Wang, JY				Yang, Fucheng; Shao, Mingqin; Wang, Jianying			Distributional and behavioral responses of the wintering Oriental Storks to drought in China's largest freshwater lake	AVIAN RESEARCH												Extreme droughts are increasing in frequency and severity globally as a result of climate change. Developing understanding of species' responses to drought is crucial for their conservation, especially in regions experiencing increased aridity. Although numerous studies have investigated birds' responses to drought, the emphasis has primarily been on landbirds. Drought can significantly alter the wetland environments that waterbirds inhabit, but the response of waterbirds to drought remains understudied. In this study, we surveyed the distribution and behavior of Oriental Storks (Ciconia boyciana) in Poyang Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in China. Results indicate that drought-induced catchment areas at the lowest water level limited the total population size of Oriental Storks in the sub-lakes. Sub-lakes with large catchment areas at the lowest water level demonstrated a capacity to support a larger population of wintering Oriental Storks. Over time, Oriental Storks exhibited a gradual concentration in Changhu Lake, characterized by larger catchments, after resource depletion in sub-lakes with smaller catchments. Additionally, the duration of Oriental Storks' vigilance and moving behaviors decreased significantly compared with that observed before the drought. After the drought, Oriental Storks increased their foraging efforts, as evidenced by increased presence in deeper water and reaching their heads and necks into deeper water to forage, higher search rates, but lower foraging rates. In accordance with area-restricted search theory, reductions in habitat quality resulting from drought, including extensive fish dieoffs, forced Oriental Storks to increase their foraging efforts. Sustaining a specific water area in sub-lakes during droughts can preserve resource availability, which is crucial for the conservation of Oriental Storks. Implementing measures such as water level control and micro-modification of lake bottoms in sub-lakes might mitigate the impact of drought on the piscivorous Oriental Storks.																			2053-7166						2024	15								100176	10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100176													WOS:001235164300001

Banding stations have studied the migratory habits of this species, but these studies rarely collect significant data regarding the origin of migrant birds captured in the midwestern United States. In the last 20 years Northern Saw-whet Owl ecology has been studied broadly; however, little is known how different populations may interact with one another. Many avian species with large geographic ranges often have populations that breed and winter in separate areas. Little has been documented to establish if this pattern exists in Northern Saw-whet Owls, a species where individuals are migratory, sedentary, and nomadic. Stable isotope ratios using deuterium delta H-2 in feathers have been successfully used to estimate the breeding origin of birds. We used stable isotope analysis of delta H-2 in conjunction with an isoscape map to determine breeding origins for Indiana Northern Saw-whet Owls. We collected 41 feather samples from migrating owls at 6 different banding sites across Indiana from October to November 2017. Because higher enrichment values in adult owl feathers complicate analysis, we only analyzed samples from young (hatching-year) individuals. After analysis and exclusion of birds identified as outliers, the model suggested that the birds originated along 44 degrees N around the Great Lakes Region and as far east as Nova Scotia, Canada. When including outliers, the model suggested that individuals originated along 40 degrees N between Iowa and New York. The outliers-excluded model remained more consistent with the known breeding range of this species than the outliers-included model. We successfully used this technique and our data suggests that the majority of Northern Saw-whet Owls originated from the Great Lakes Region. We recommend further investigation on the physiology and behavior of owls on the breeding grounds, which could aid in the ability to better understand differences in delta H-2 enrichment of this species.

The reconstruction of natural and cultural events at the Pleistocene - Holocene boundary suggests that the palaeoindian occupations are closely related with the specialized hunting for mega-mammals living in lacustrine palaeoenvironments subjected to aridity stress. The resource crisis and human predation would be correlated with lake dessication events which would have affected the midlatitudes of North and South America.

J	Churchill, JH; Kerfoot, WC				Churchill, James H.; Kerfoot, W. Charles			The impact of surface heat flux and wind on thermal stratification in Portage Lake, Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Portage Lake is situated near the center of the Keweenaw Peninsula and is connected to Lake Superior via lengthy (> 7 km) navigation channels. Using moored thermistor records and meteorological data, we examine how changes in lake stratification are related to surface winds and heat flux. Frequent episodes of full water column mixing are observed throughout the summer. Convective mixing through surface cooling appears to be an important agent responsible for these events, as all occur during cold air outbreaks and when the net heat flux is directed out of the lake (negative). However, wind-induced mixing is also implicated in contributing to some vertical mixing events, as evidenced by two events initiated during a period of strong winds and declining, but not yet negative, heat fluxes. Our analysis indicates that each time the water column restratifies, it tends to become more susceptible to convectively-driven overturn during cold air outbreaks. This tendency is quantified by the estimated time over which surface cooling due to a specified set of conditions, characteristic of a cold air outbreak, would reduce the temperature contrast between the upper and lower layers by half. This time declines by more than an order of magnitude for successive restratification events observed in the summer of 1999. Our analysis also reveals successive formation and dissolution of a diurnal surface mixed layer in an otherwise homogeneous water column during a 10-day period of August 1999. This is attributed to the combination of relatively light winds and negative daily net heat fluxes.																			0380-1330					MAR	2007	33	1					143	155		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[143:TIOSHF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[143:TIOSHF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245692400013

Northern hemisphere controls on tropical southeast African climate during the past 60,000 years	SCIENCE												The processes that control climate in the tropics are poorly understood. We applied compound-specific hydrogen isotopes (delta D) and the TEX86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) temperature proxy to sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika to independently reconstruct precipitation and temperature variations during the past 60,000 years. Tanganyika temperatures follow Northern Hemisphere insolation and indicate that warming in tropical southeast Africa during the last glacial termination began to increase similar to 3000 years before atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. delta D data show that this region experienced abrupt changes in hydrology coeval with orbital and millennial-scale events recorded in Northern Hemisphere monsoonal climate records. This implies that precipitation in tropical southeast Africa is more strongly controlled by changes in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the winter Indian monsoon than by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.

To better understand the detailed physical processes responsible for holomixis, this study investigated a cold low-oxygen water intrusion event on the northeastern slope of weakly stratified Lake Biwa (Japan), observed using mooring systems. The intrusion occurred concurrently with superinertial oscillations of near-bottom currents. The effective Wedderburn number suggests that basin-scale Kelvin waves were excited by north-eastward winds (similar to 4 m s(-1)) prior to the intrusion event. The results of a modal analysis suggest that the intrusion was caused by a combination of Kelvin and Poincare waves that locally uplifted the cold deep water. The heat budget analyses revealed that a substantial part of the intruded cold water was mixed diapycnally, induced by wind stirring, nighttime convection, and bottom friction. The superinertial currents enhanced the dissipation due to bottom friction by similar to 30%. The cold water intrusion and subsequent mixing provided local heat flux of 98 W m(-2) over 6 days, which was 1.4 times larger than the average surface heat flux over the same period. In addition to previously studied processes, such as surface cooling and gravity currents from the shore, this study indicates that wind-induced baroclinic motions and subsequent diapycnal mixing of a stratified water column contribute to holomixis.					; NAGAI, Takeyoshi/O-1926-2014	Nagai, Takeyoshi/0000-0001-6400-878X; Homma, Hikaru/0000-0002-4125-220X													2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	3					364	378		10.5268/IW-6.3.898	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.3.898													WOS:000384067400009

Modular community structure suggests metabolic plasticity during the transition to polar night in ice-covered Antarctic lakes	ISME JOURNAL												High-latitude environments, such as the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, are subject to seasonally segregated light-dark cycles, which have important consequences for microbial diversity and function on an annual basis. Owing largely to the logistical difficulties of sampling polar environments during the darkness of winter, little is known about planktonic microbial community responses to the cessation of photosynthetic primary production during the austral sunset, which lingers from approximately February to April. Here, we hypothesized that changes in bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic community structure, particularly shifts in favor of chemolithotrophs and mixotrophs, would manifest during the transition to polar night. Our work represents the first concurrent molecular characterization, using 454 pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene, of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic communities in permanently ice-covered lakes Fryxell and Bonney, before and during the polar night transition. We found vertically stratified populations that varied at the community and/or operational taxonomic unit-level between lakes and seasons. Network analysis based on operational taxonomic unit level interactions revealed nonrandomly structured microbial communities organized into modules (groups of taxa) containing key metabolic potential capacities, including photoheterotrophy, mixotrophy and chemolithotrophy, which are likely to be differentially favored during the transition to polar night.					; Vick-Majors, Trista/AAQ-6258-2020	Vick-Majors, Trista/0000-0002-6868-4010; 													1751-7362	1751-7370				APR	2014	8	4					778	789		10.1038/ismej.2013.190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2013.190								24152712					WOS:000333189700005

Relative recruitment success of stocked age-1 vs age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) in the Nelson River, northern Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				Success of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) stocking programmes has rarely been evaluated. As of the early 1990s, Lake Sturgeon populations were nearly extirpated from several sections of the upper Nelson River, Manitoba, at least in part due to historical overexploitation. Between 1994 and 2011, 20885 fingerlings (age-0, untagged) and 1117 yearlings (age-1, 1014 PIT tagged) were stocked into an upper Nelson River reach. In fall 2012, a Lake Sturgeon population inventory using gill nets assessed post-release survival/retention of stocked fish. Of 91 unique Lake Sturgeon captured, 67 (74%) possessed PIT tags, signifying they were stocked at age-1. Relative recruitment success was conservatively estimated to be 17.7 times greater for age-1 vs age-0 stocked fish based only on PIT tag recapture data. However, including 19 additional fish identified as stocked at age-1 based on atypical first' annuli patterns, the revised relative recruitment success rate was 130 times greater for age-1 vs age-0. An interpreted consensus ageing method produced correct age assignment 97% of the time for juveniles of known age, despite complications caused by overwinter growth in the hatchery.

Variations in pCO2 during summer in the surface water of an unproductive lake in northern Sweden	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Unproductive lakes are generally supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 to the atmosphere continuously during ice-free periods. However, temporal variation of the partial pressure Of CO2 (PCO2) and thus Of CO2 evasion to atmosphere is poorly documented. We therefore carried out temporally high-resolution (every 6 h) measurements of the PCO2 using an automated logger system in the surface water of a subarctic, unproductive, lake in the birch forest belt. The study period was June-September 2004. We found that the PCO2 showed large seasonal variation, but low daily variation. The seasonal variation was likely mainly caused by variations in input and mineralization of allocluthonous organic matter. Stratification depth probably also influenced PCO2 of the surface water by controlling the volume in which mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) occurred. In lakes, with large variations in PCO2, as in our study lake a high (weekly) sampling intensity is recommended for obtaining accurate estimates of the evasion Of CO2.																			0280-6509					NOV	2007	59	5					797	803		10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00307.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2007.00307.x													WOS:000250752400003

Origin and diversification of the soldier meadow springsnails (Hydrobiidae: Pyrgulopsis), a species flock in the northwestern Great Basin, United States	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												The large, western North American hydrobiid gastropod genus Pyrgulopsis (commonly known as springsnails) includes a series of locally endemic faunas that are thought to be species flocks. Although these assemblages are of interest from the evolutionary, biogeographic and conservation perspectives, their monophyly and phylogenetic relationships have yet to be rigorously evaluated. Here we present a molecular phylogeny (based on mitochondrial sequence data) of a putative flock of four thermal spring-dwelling springsnails that is distributed in many sites in Soldier Meadow and a single locality in Bog Hot Valley (northwestern Nevada). Our analyses support monophyly of this assemblage ('Soldier Meadow clade') and a close relationship with other regional species and suggest that the invasion of thermal habitats by these springsnails occurred independently of other such radiations within the genus. The divergence of the Soldier Meadow clade relative to its sister group is substantial (6.7910.36% for COI, 10.35-15.88% for NDI), suggesting a split in the early Pliocene, based on the application of a COI clock for Pyrgulopsis. The splits within the Soldier Meadow clade into three main subunits also appear to be old events, based on their 5.78-8.54% COI divergence relative to each other. These findings are consistent with a long history of springsnail evolution in Soldier Meadow, which is intriguing given that this basin was flooded by Lake Lahontan during periods of the early and middle Pleistocene. We suggest that progenitors of the contemporary fauna survived in high elevation springs that may have been present in the basin during these pluvial periods and subsequently colonized contemporary habitats following the termination of the extreme Lake Lahontan highstands. We speculate that the broadly disjunct population (of P. militaris) in Bog Hot Valley, which is consistently nested within the Soldier Meadow clade in our phylogenetic analyses, is either a vicariant relict of a spring zone that may have once extended between these two areas; or was founded by a past `jump' dispersal event from Soldier Meadow. Phylogeographic structure of springsnail populations in Soldier Meadow bears the strong stamp of geologically recent, allopatric diversification, perhaps reflecting the short time that basin floor habitats have been occupied. We describe a new species (P. varneri) for a series of recently discovered populations that are monophyletic, substantially divergent and morphologically distinctive. Additional studies will be necessary to confidently assess the taxonomic status of morphologically distinctive P. limaria and P. umbilicata, which are shown herein to be little divergent genetically; and a recently discovered minute springsnail that is morphologically divergent yet closely similar genetically to P. notidicola.																			0260-1230	1464-3766				MAY	2007	73		2				167	183		10.1093/mollus/eym014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eym014													WOS:000249267200007

While 1D hydrodynamical models could be helpful in improving the knowledge of the thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour of French water bodies, the scarcity of data for calibration and validation, in addition to the unavailability of some forcing data, makes their application difficult for most French water bodies. In this article we explore an alternative statistical approach that takes advantage of the available data in order to inform future modelling applications. We used official monitoring data and satellite measurements to study the thermal characteristics of more than 400 French water bodies (depth: 1-310 m, surface area: 0.1-577 km(2), volume: 0.1-89,000 hm(3)). The objective was to identify the importance of size on their thermal behaviour. For this we analysed the annual temperature cycle, the summer temperature profiles and within-lake spatial variability. Together with size, geography and transparency determine the thermal behaviour of water bodies through complex interactions. As a result of the analysis we propose a classification of French water bodies as a function of depth and surface area that reflects the summer vertical temperature gradient and the processes influencing the deepening of the thermocline.

Extensive research has been conducted using remote imagery to estimate the recent area and volume changes of these glaciers with the goal of estimating the potential effects of these changes on watershed streamflow. Results show that the glaciers were mostly in recession since 1966, the beginning of the study period. The current research was performed to supplement results from the remote imagery analyses. In this paper, streamflows from glaciated and nonglaciated watersheds in the WRR for the period 1967-1992 were analyzed. The difference in July-August-September (JAS) watershed flow magnitude for the 26-year period between glaciated (Green River and Bull Lake Creek) and nonglaciated (East Fork River and Wind River) watersheds ranged between 8 and 23%. As expected, the effects of glaciers on local streamflows during JAS were shown to be much greater than that of ice melt alone. The influence of glaciers accounted for 23-54% of the late summer (JAS) flow in glaciated watersheds with approximately 2-12% because of loss of glacial mass, whereas the remainder of the increased flow was because of the glaciers decelerating the snowmelt runoff through internal storage/delayed release of liquid water. The glaciated watersheds provided a more stable source of streamflow because they displayed less year-to-year streamflow variability with coefficients of variation of 0.36 (Green River) and 0.29 (Bull Lake Creek) compared with the nonglaciated values of 0.55 (East Fork River) and 0.45 (Wind River).

The Ponto-Caspian invader, Hemimysis anomala, was recently found in large numbers in a gravel-pit lake connected to the Lower Rhine. Mysids were sampled with Perspex traps between September 2002 and April 2003 to study the population dynamics, vertical migration and feeding. 2. The abundance (as catch per unit effort, CPUE) of H. anomala declined from 270 individuals (ind.) trap(-1) (4 h)(-1) in December to below 4 ind. trap(-1) (4 h)(-1) in April. Average lengths ranged from 4.9 mm in autumn to 9.9 mm in March. The length-weight relationship of virgin females changed throughout the sampling period, from a size-corrected wet weight of 5.1 mg in September to 16.6 mg in April for a female of 7.8 mm. 3. Successive monthly samples taken over 24 h revealed that H. anomala preferred the surface at twilight and night. During dawn the mysids migrated to the middle and bottom layers and were hardly found during day. Diel vertical migration clearly depends on the proximate factor light. 4. Stomach analyses revealed that larger H. anomala preferred zooplankton, whereas small individuals fed more on phytoplankton. The seasonal comparison showed an increasing percentage of zooplankton with increasing length. The proportion of zooplankton in the stomachs of large H. anomala individuals was highest during night and lowest during day. 5. The results suggest that H. anomala may become an important link between primary/secondary production and higher trophic levels in the food web of its new environments at the Lower Rhine.

J	Levine, MA; Whalen, SC				Levine, MA; Whalen, SC			Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton production in Alaskan Arctic foothill lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We used 54 enrichment bioassays to assess nutrient limitation (N, P) of C-14 uptake by natural phytoplankton assemblages in 39 lakes and ponds in the Arctic Foothills region of Alaska. Our purpose was to categorize phytoplankton nutrient status in this under-represented region of North America and to improve our ability to predict the response of primary production to anticipated anthropogenically mediated increases in nutrient loading. Experiments were performed across several watersheds and included assays on terminal lakes and lakes occupying various positions in chains (lakes in series within a watershed and connected by streams). In total, 89% (48 of 54) of the bioassays showed significant stimulation of C-14 primary production by some form of nutrient addition relative to unamended controls. A significant response was observed following enrichment with N and P, N alone and P alone in 83, 35 and 22% of the bioassays, respectively. In experiments where N and P proved stimulatory, the influence of N alone was significantly greater than the influence of P alone. Overall, the data point to a greater importance for N than P in regulating phytoplankton production in this region. The degree of response to N and P enrichment declined as the summer progressed and showed no relationship to irradiance or water temperature, suggesting secondary limitation by some micronutrient such as iron as the summer advanced. Phytoplankton nutrient status was often consistent across lakes within a watershed, suggesting that watershed characteristics influence nutrient availability. Lakes in this region will clearly show increased phytoplankton production in response to anthropogenic activities and anticipated changes in climate that will increase nutrient loading.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 1	2001	455						189	201		10.1023/A:1011954221491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011954221491													WOS:000173247400018

Biogenic silica fluxes obtained from sediment trap collections were compared with fluxes predicted from the silica disappearance model. Measured and predicted fluxes agreed well for offshore stations, but at stations closer to shore measured fluxes were 2-3 times greater than predicted fluxes. Sediment trap and water chemistry data show that little of the diatom production is dissolved in the water column. Thus, greater than predicted fluxes at nearshore locations were attributed to new silica supplied from upwellings, tributary inputs, and recycling and resuspension in nearshore sediments. The good agreement between measured and predicted fluxes in offshore waters shows that biogenic silica fluxes may be useful in determining the collecting efficiency of sediment traps.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1984	29	1					99	110		10.4319/lo.1984.29.1.0099	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1984.29.1.0099													WOS:A1984SF65800008
J	Brzezinski, M; Eliava, G; Zmihorski, M				Brzezinski, Marcin; Eliava, George; Zmihorski, Michal			Road mortality of pond-breeding amphibians during spring migrations in the Mazurian Lakeland, NE Poland	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The effects of road traffic mortality on amphibian populations are in many cases hard to estimate and speculate, primarily due to the inaccuracy of the methods employed in studies. We have analyzed amphibian road mortality during two breeding seasons on selected road sections adjoining spawning ponds and have critically reviewed methods used for estimating the impact of road traffic on migrating amphibians. The mortality rates of particular amphibian species differed significantly and varied according to year, site, and traffic volume. The highest mortality was recorded for Bufo bufo and the lowest for Lissotriton vulgaris. Species-specific parameter estimates of mortality, evaluated on a daily basis counts of roadkills, were positively correlated with the mean body mass of the amphibian species. The share of a given species among carcasses found on the road, commonly used in such studies, proved to be an unreliable measure of mortality. We found that nearly 60% of amphibian roadkill victims had disappeared within 24 h of exposure, and the number of missing carcasses was inversely related to body mass.					; Zmihorski, Michal/G-7366-2011	, Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425													1612-4642	1439-0574				AUG	2012	58	4					685	693		10.1007/s10344-012-0618-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-012-0618-2													WOS:000306696100007
J	Grigg, LD; Whitlock, C; Dean, WE				Grigg, LD; Whitlock, C; Dean, WE			Evidence for millennial-scale climate change during marine isotope stages 2 and 3 at Little Lake, western Oregon, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen and geochemical data from Little Lake, western Oregon, suggest several patterns of millennial-scale environmental change during marine isotope stage (MIS)2 (14,100-27,600 cal yr B.P.) and the latter part of MIS 3 (27,600-42,500 cal yr B.P.). During MIS 3, a series of transitions between warm- and cold-adapted taxa indicate that temperatures oscillated by ca, 2 degrees -4 degreesC every 1000-3000 yr. Highs and lows in summer insolation during MIS 3 are generally associated with the warmest and coldest intervals. Warm periods at Little Lake correlate with warm sea-surface temperatures in the Santa Barbara Basin. Changes in the strength of the subtropical high and the jet stream may account for synchronous changes at the two sites. During MIS 2, shifts between mesic and xeric subalpine forests suggest changes in precipitation every 1000-3000 yr. Increases in Tsuga heterophylla pollen at 25,000 and 22,000 cal yr B.P. imply brief warmings, Minimum summer insolation and maximum global ice-volumes during MIS 2 correspond to cold and dry conditions. Fluctuations in precipitation at Little Lake do not correlate with changes in the Santa Barbara Basin and may be explained by variations in the strength of the glacial anticyclone and the position of the jet stream.

Establishing realistic management objectives for urban lakes using paleolimnological techniques: an example from Halifax Region (Nova Scotia, Canada)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												To determine pre-disturbance limnological conditions, evaluate the impact of environmental stressors (surface water acidification, nutrient inputs, climate change, and winter deicing salt), and set realistic recovery targets for lake management strategies, a rapid assessment paleolimnological approach was used to determine the amount (and likely causes) of environmental changes over the past similar to 100-150 years in 51 urban lakes from Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada). Diatom assemblages from lake sediment cores were used with "top" (recently deposited, surface) samples being matched to measured limnological conditions, and "bottom" (generally from >15 cm deep) samples used to infer pre-disturbance limnological conditions such as pH, total phosphorus (TP), specific conductance, and shifts due to changing climatic conditions. Environmental change was assessed by calculating the metric of change in species composition between present-day and pre-disturbance diatom assemblages, and inferences from quantitative estimates of diatom-inferred pH, specific conductance, and TP. All 51 study lakes have experienced floristic changes in diatom species composition since pre-disturbance times, but different environmental stressors were implicated: 8 of the 51 lakes underwent significant (i.e., >2 times the root mean-squared error [2X RMSE] of the inference model) decreases in diatom-inferred pH; 8 lakes had significant increases in diatom-inferred TP; and 19 otherwise relatively pristine lakes had increases in planktonic taxa consistent with observations linked to changes in lake seasonality and limnological changes most closely linked to climate warming in Nova Scotia and other regions. The remaining 16 lakes did not have large and consistent changes in diatom flora or changes in diatom-inferred TP or pH>2X RMSE of the prediction of the models. Lake-specific factors were related to these inferences, and the lakes that acidified were mainly the currently most acidic sites, whereas those that experienced issues related to eutrophication were generally among the most alkaline sites. Of our 51 lakes, 22 (including some experiencing pH, TP, or showing floristic changes linked to climate changes) had increases in measured conductivity (1980-2002) and, correspondingly, increased relative abundances of halophilic diatom taxa. These lakes, often with catchments containing high surface areas of impervious surfaces, are examples of a trend of increasing salinity in northeastern North American lakes likely related to winter application of deicing (road) salt. The application of this paleolimnological approach enabled us to identify which lakes have undergone significant changes in diatom assemblages, as well as which environmental stressor(s) were most probable. This information can help lake managers develop more targeted and effective management strategies.

J	James, WF				James, William F.			Nitrogen retention in a floodplain backwater of the upper Mississippi River (USA)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Backwaters connected to large rivers retain nitrate and may play an important role in reducing downstream loading to coastal marine environments. A summer nitrogen (N) inflow-outflow budget was examined for a flow-regulated backwater of the upper Mississippi River in conjunction with laboratory estimates of sediment ammonium and nitrate fluxes, organic N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification to provide further insight into N retention processes. External N loading was overwhelmingly dominated by nitrate and 54% of the input was retained (137 mg m(-2) day(-1)). Ammonium and dissolved organic N were exported from the backwater (14 and 9 mg m(-2) day(-1), respectively). Nitrate influx to sediment increased as a function of increasing initial nitrate concentration in the overlying water. Rates were greater under anoxic versus oxic conditions. Ammonium effluxes from sediment were 26.7 and 50.6 mg m(-2) day(-1) under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively. Since anoxia inhibited nitrification, the difference between ammonium anoxic-oxic fluxes approximated a nitrification rate of 29.1 mg m(-2) day(-1). Organic N mineralization was 64 mg m(-2) day(-1). Denitrification, estimated from regression relationships between oxic nitrate influx versus initial nitrate concentration and a summer lakewide mean nitrate concentration of 1.27 mg l(-1), was 94 mg m(-2) day(-1). Denitrification was equivalent to only 57% of the retained nitrate, suggesting that another portion was assimilated by biota. The high sediment organic N mineralization and ammonium efflux rate coupled with the occurrence of ammonium export from the system suggested a possible link between biotic assimilation of nitrate, mineralization, and export.																			1015-1621					JAN	2010	72	1					61	69		10.1007/s00027-009-0113-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-009-0113-3													WOS:000272901900006

Species richness decreased by 78 % and numbers of individuals by 92 %. Species diversity and equitability both increased. The main refuge for macroinvertebrates changed from emergent and submerged vegetation to the undersides of stones. The marked change in the macroinvertebrate community is attributed to a fall in water level which, owing to the particular lake morphometry, left vegetation stranded and a large area of the former littoral zone exposed.																			0003-9136						1997	139	2					197	206																WOS:A1997XC27100005

In Sulawesi, however, all 31 described species occur in lake habitats. This exclusivity is certainly an artefact, a consequence of the lack of research in non-lacustrine habitats. Indeed, recent explorations discovered three species in non-lacustrine habitats, Sulawesidrobia lasoloensis sp. nov. and S. marmer sp. nov. in small streams in Southeast Sulawesi, and S. tilangaensis sp. nov. in the spring-fed Tilanga natural pool in South Sulawesi. We describe these species based on shell morphology, anatomy as well as mitochondrial sequence data and, based on the latter, inferred their phylogenetic relationships. These analyses also included new samples from Lake Poso. Sulawesidrobia lasoloensis sp. nov. and S. marmer sp. nov. formed a sister group to a clade from the Malili-Lake system, whereas S. tilangaensis sp. nov. was nested among the species from Lake Poso. Considering the long branches as well as the geographic distances between the new species and their respective lake relatives as well as the large unexplored areas, many more species dwelling in similar, for tateids more typical habitats are to be expected.

Several studies have reported moderate to high total mercury (Hg) concentrations and contrasting methylmercury (CH3Hg+) production in different lake compartments. Sources of Hg for western Patagonian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are still not clear; while point sources can be ruled out and atmospheric deposition is a plausible source, along with contribution from active volcanic areas of the Andes. In this investigation, we reported a noticeably seasonal, spatial (between lake branches), and vertical (between water column strata) heterogeneity in the total Hg concentrations found in the pelagic zone of Lake Moreno. Sterile water samples taken in a depth profile of the lake showed moderate to high concentrations of CH3Hg+ in autumn with a decreasing trend with depth. Our results indicated that Hg is largely allocated in the plankton fraction between 10-53 mu m; which dominated within the euphotic (epilimnetic) zone of the lake due to the high densities attained by two species of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium. The 53-200 mu m planktonic size fraction (comprising rotifers, ciliates and immature stages of crustaceans) and the > 200 mu m fraction (calanoid copepods and cladocerans) were found to bear strikingly lower total Hg concentrations, suggesting that the magnification of Hg at the planktonic consumer level is negligible.

J	Nielsen, LC; DePaolo, DJ				Nielsen, Laura C.; DePaolo, Donald J.			Ca isotope fractionation in a high-alkalinity lake system: Mono Lake, California	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals from aqueous solutions causes surface-controlled kinetic stable Ca isotope fractionation. The magnitude of fractionation depends on the relative rates of ion attachment to and detachment from the mineral surface, which in turn is predicted to depend on both the saturation state and the solution stoichiometry or the Ca2+ : CO32- activity ratio. Experimental studies have not directly investigated the effects of varying solution stoichiometry on calcium isotope partitioning during calcite or aragonite growth, but natural alkaline lake systems such as Mono Lake, California provide a test bed for the hypothesized stoichiometry dependence. Mono Lake has a Ca2+ : CO32- activity ratio of about 0.0001, seven orders of magnitude lower than ocean water and typical terrestrial freshwater. We present chemical and isotopic measurements of streams, springs, lake water, and precipitated carbonates from the Mono Basin that yield evidence of stoichiometry-dependent Ca isotope fractionation during calcite, aragonite and Mg-calcite precipitation from the alkaline lake water. To estimate the Ca isotope fractionation factors, it is necessary to characterize the lake Ca balance and constrain the variability of lake water chemistry both spatially and temporally. Streams and springs supply Ca to the lake, and a substantial fraction of this supply is precipitated along the lake shore to form tufa towers. Lake water is significantly supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals, so CaCO3 also precipitates directly from the water column to form carbonate-rich bottom sediments. Growth rate inhibition by orthophosphate likely preserves the high degree of supersaturation in the lake. Strontium isotope ratios are used to estimate the proportions of fresh and alkaline lake water from which each solid carbonate sample precipitated. Carbonate minerals that precipitate directly from lake water (low Ca2+ : CO32-) experience relatively large Ca isotope fractionation during growth. Tufa and shoreline carbonates that precipitate from lake water with a significant fraction of spring water (higher Ca2+ : CO32-) are considerably less fractionated, as predicted from theory. The behavior of the Mono Lake Ca isotope system is similar in some ways to that of the global oceans, in that the average delta Ca-44/40 of lake water is positive (estimated average of +1) and both riverine inputs and precipitated carbonates are isotopically light (delta Ca-44/40 between -0.5 and 0). We present a calcium isotope budget of the lake to constrain the long-term average lake water Ca isotope composition. Archived water samples indicate that the lake delta Ca-44/40 varied by over 2 parts per thousand between 1995 and 2010. The most extreme excursions are toward higher delta Ca-44/40, and are probably caused by carbonate precipitation events induced by breakdown of chemostratification. This variability indicates that the lake is out of steady state with respect to calcium isotopes, and that unlike the ocean, calcium isotopes in Mono Basin carbonate sediments likely do not record the balance between weathering and carbonate mineralization fluxes to and from the lake.

J	Bocaniov, SA; Smith, REH				Bocaniov, Serghei A.; Smith, Ralph E. H.			Plankton metabolic balance at the margins of very large lakes: temporal variability and evidence for dominance of autochthonous processes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Planktonic metabolic balance (PMBm) of the surface mixed layer (SML) was measured as the ratio of areal rates of gross photosynthesis (AGP) to community respiration (AR) to test the idea that previously neglected allochthonous inputs of organic matter may support chronic excess respiration relative to photosynthesis even in very large lakes during the summer (May-October) season. Four Laurentian Great Lakes coastal sites of varying trophic status, physical structure and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were studied with oxygen light-and dark bottle and C-14 methods, with excess respiration anticipated in the higher DOC sites. Planktonic metabolic balance was net autotrophic in 73% of the observations. The calculated mixing depth at which respiration would predominate over photosynthesis was greater than typically observed mixing depths, varying from 11 to 25 m in the more transparent, low DOC (< 3 g m(-3)) sites to 8-15 m in the higher DOC (4-6 g m(-3)) sites. Biweekly measurements at one higher and one lower DOC site over two successive summer seasons showed that seasonal gross photosynthesis (Sigma AGP) exceeded seasonal community respiration (Sigma AR). Despite the location of the sites at the periphery of the lakes, where allochthonous influences should be strongest, the measurements indicated prevailing conditions of net autotrophy in the SML. Individual measurements of AR from this study and the literature were correlated with AGP but season average values were more tightly correlated, suggesting a tighter coupling of metabolic rates on a larger scale and a looser coupling on a shorter scale. The observed temporal variability was variable in pattern among years, and likely to confound inferences based on limited sampling. It is shown that accepted formulations for AGP and AR lead to the conclusion that PMBm should be largely predictable from knowledge of a biological properties ratio (light-saturated gross photosynthesis to plankton community respiration, P-max/R) and a physical properties ratio (euphotic to mixing depths, Z(eu)/Z(m)) and this prediction was confirmed using data from this study and from the literature. The evident success of this model points to the pre-eminent importance of plankton biomass and physical conditions in determining metabolic balance. Variation in these fundamental factors appears capable of explaining the diversity of PMBm reported for different Great Lakes.					; Smith, Ralph/F-3655-2010	BOCANIOV, SERGHEI/0000-0001-5988-2034; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2009	54	2					345	362		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02120.x													WOS:000262470300010

The Fuhe River plays an important role in determining the water ecological environment of Baiyangdian Lake. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to study the microbial distribution characteristics in the Fuhe River in different seasons. The results showed that some environmental factors of the surface water (ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP)) were different on the spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, there were no seasonal differences in the contents of TN, TP, total organic carbon (TOC), or heavy metals in the sediments. The distributions of Cyanobacteria, Actinomycetes and Firmicutes in the water and Actinomycetes and Planctomycetes in the sediments differed significantly among seasons (P < 0.05). There were significant spatial differences in bacteria in the surface water, with the highest abundance of Proteobacteria recorded in the river along with the highest nutrient concentration, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in the upstream than the downstream. Microbial communities in the water were most sensitive to temperature (T) and the TP concentration (P < 0.01). Moreover, differences in the bacterial community were better explained by the content of heavy metals in the sediments than by the chemical characteristics. A PICRUSt metabolic inference analysis showed that the effect of high summer temperatures on the enzyme action led to an increase in the abundances of the metabolic-related genes of the river microorganisms.

The removal of sales and usage of lindane in 2002 in Canada has resulted in a rapid decline in atmospheric concentrations of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in the Canadian prairies. Pre-emergent herbicides which are used on grain and oil seed crops in the Canadian prairies show the highest atmospheric concentrations during the spring (May-June) when they are typically applied. Atmospheric concentrations of triallate are much higher than trifluralin or ethalfluralin in 2003. In 2010, there was a shift in time of the spring maximum atmospheric concentration of pre-emergent herbicides attributed to delays in seeding of wheat and canola. There was also a decline in atmospheric concentrations of triallate in 2010 as compared to 2003 which was associated with an increase in production of canola, and decline both locally and regionally in wheat production due to wet weather conditions in 2010. Ethalfluralin or triallate are potential replacement herbicides for use on canola or grain crops, and the long-range atmospheric transport of these pre-emergent herbicides should be considered together with trifluralin in future implications of potential restrictions developed for United Nations Economic Commission of Europe protocol on persistent organic pollutants.

RESPONSE TO SILVER NANOPARTICLES THROUGH MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATIONS	SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS												Intensive development of nanotechnologies makes it viable to determine the influence of nanocompounds on the productive properties of crop plants, considering the environmental factors due to current climate change. The presented study aimed to investigate the effects of silver nanoparticles on the seeds' ability to germinate, variability of morphophysiological traits during the vegetation period, and grain yield of spring soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The wheat's pre-sowing seed treatment with silver nanoparticles (silver nanoparticles in aqueous solution of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) reached evaluation for variations in morphophysiological traits in three cultivars, viz., Omskaya-36, Tyumenskaya-29, and Novosibirskaya-31. All the seed treatments, carried out once, had the seeds kept in prepared solutions for three hours, as well as, the control (in distilled water only). Field experiments took place in 2018-2020 at the biostation 'Lake Kuchak' of Tyumen State University, Tyumen, Russia. Seed treatment (Ag 1.0%) contributed to an increase in field seed germination in the cultivar Omskaya-36 (by 23.8%) during 2019. For grain yield, positive results occurred in the cultivar Omskaya-36 (by 23.8% compared with the control) in 2019-2020, while in Tyumenskaya-29 (by 25.9%) in all years of the study, and cultivar Novosibirskaya-31 (by 12.8%) in 2019-2020.

J	Skov, C; Berg, S				Skov, C; Berg, S			Utilization of natural and artificial habitats by YOY pike in a biomanipulated lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				Biomanipulation by stocking with YOY pike Esox lucius has been shown to be a useful tool in the restoration of shallow hypertrophic lakes. The success of such stocking depends partly on the standing stock of the YOY pike in the first 2-3 months following stocking, this in turn depending on habitat type and abundance in the lake. The present study evaluated the general habitat use and preferences of YOY pike and the suitability of artificial submerged habitats formed by small laid out spruce trees Picea omorica using Point Abundance Sampling by Electrofishing (PASE). This sampling method was assessed as being suitable for catching and quantifying small pike. While very few pike were present in either the dominant emergent vegetation Phragmites australis or the subdominant vegetation Typha spp. in June and July, they were present in significantly greater numbers in the artificial habitats. This suggests that the use of spruce trees as artificial habitats in biomanipulation projects could potentially enhance the standing stock of YOY pike. In August, in contrast, habitat utilization by the YOY pike did not differ from that expected if they used the habitats randomly. This suggests that YOY pike change their habitat utilization as a function of their size. Thus they use habitats with a complex structure in the early summer, but in late summer when they are larger, they use habitats with a less complex structure such as Phragmites and Typha.					; Berg, Søren/AAJ-8104-2021	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Berg, Soren/0000-0001-8772-0921; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						115	122		10.1023/A:1017043015547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017043015547													WOS:000084892400012

This transboundary population, residing in Kootenay Lake and Kootenay River in Canada, and the Kootenai River in the US, has been in general decline since the mid-1960's. There has been very little recruitment to this population in the last 20 years. This population became isolated from other white sturgeon populations of the Columbia River basin during the last ice age of approximately 10,000 years ago. The population adapted to the pre-development conditions of the Kootenai system, with a high spring freshet and extensive side channel and low-lying delta marshlands. Modification of the Kootenai River by human activities, such as industrial developments, floodplain dyking, and dam construction has changed the hydrograph of the Kootenai River, altering sturgeon spawning, incubation and rearing habitats and reducing overall biological productivity. A Kootenai River white sturgeon draft recovery plan was prepared by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with other agencies in the US and Canada. The plan was peer reviewed and there was a parallel public consultation process, where public commentary was invited from both sides of the international border. The short-term recovery objectives of the recovery plan are to prevent extinction and re-establish successful natural recruitment. The identified long-term objectives are the re-establishment of a self sustaining population and the restoration of productive habitat, in order to downlist to threatened status and subsequently delist this population when recovery is well established. Specific actions needed for recovery include spring flow augmentation during the reproduction period; a conservation aquaculture program to prevent near-term extinction; habitat restoration, and research and monitoring programs to evaluate recovery progress.																			0175-8659					SEP	1999	15	4-5					157	163		10.1111/j.1439-0426.1999.tb00226.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1999.tb00226.x													WOS:000082903500035

Lake Ulansuhai, located in Hetao irrigation district in Inner Mongolia, is the only sink for the all industrial and agricultural drainage and sole outlet for this district to the Yellow River, which is one of the main source of drinking water for the numerous cities and towns downstream. Because Ulansuahi is ice-covered during winter, the QWASI model was modified by adding an ice equation to get a more accurate understanding of the fate and transport of mercury within the lake. Both laboratory and field tests were carried out during the ice growth period. The aquivalence and mass balance approaches were used to develop the modified QWASI + ice model. The margins of error between the modelled and the measured average concentrations of Hg in ice, water, and sediment were 30%, 26.2%, and 19.8% respectively. These results suggest that the new QWASI + ice model could be used to more accurately represent the fate and transport of mercury in the seasonally ice-covered lakes, during the ice growth period.

A 10,000-year lake-sediment based reconstruction of precipitation isotope values in the Canadian Rocky Mountains	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a 10,000-year carbonate oxygen isotope (518O) record from Shark Lake, Alberta, (50.8411 degrees N, 115.3983 degrees W; 1,857 m above sea level) that provides insight on past changes in precipitation seasonality, regional hydroclimate dynamics and atmospheric circulation. Shark Lake has a hydrologically open configuration, with water isotope values that mirror annual mean precipitation, and contains a continuous sediment sequence consisting largely of authigenic carbonate minerals precipitated from the water column. The sediment 518O record exhibits a shift from lower to higher-than-average 518O values from the middle to late Holocene circa 4,100 calendar years before present (yr BP). This transition generally aligns with hypothesized transformations in atmospheric circulation that ostensibly led to reduced winter precipitation in northwestern North America and heightened aridity in the southwest during the late Holocene. Monte Carlo cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that other precipitation 518O records from the Pacific Northwest have a significant positive correlation with the Shark Lake record, in contrast with records from the southern Rocky Mountains and central/eastern North America, which have a negative correlation with the Shark Lake record and others from the Northwest. We apply the previously established strong relationship between atmospheric circulation associated with the Pacific North American Pattern (PNA) and precipitation isotope values across North America to explain the marked coherency in precipitation 518O reconstructions. Collectively, the paleo-records suggest a middle to late Holocene transition in the mean state of atmospheric circulation over North America from one similar to the negative phase of the PNA to one comparable to the positive PNA phase, in response to non-linear changes in oceanatmosphere circulation driven by ice sheet decay and insolation forcing. This shift had substantial impacts on the source and isotopic composition of air masses traversing the continent and their interplay with circulation from the Gulf of Mexico as well as the seasonal amount and distributions of precipitation. Our results underscore the need for additional isotope-enabled climate model simulations and additional 518O records, especially from understudied regions across North America, for a comprehensive view of seasonal-scale hydroclimate variations and synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation pattern changes over the Holocene.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 15	2025	356								109255	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109255		MAR 2025											WOS:001443728500001

Sinking rate could not be so described. The response surfaces were calculated by multiple regressions, including first- and second-order terms of T and S and the interaction term T . S. Although the data base was rather limited (number of phytoplankton species ranged from 10 to 31), the resulting surfaces often reflected a corresponding attribute of the water along T and S (e.g. phytoplankton temperature optimum for growth reflected water temperature). The results support the frequent use of physical factors as explanatory variables for the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton.																			0024-3590					MAY	1995	40	3					589	597		10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0589	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0589													WOS:A1995RE86200016

Reduction of resuspended sediments by the pelagic herbivore, Daphnia pulex	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												We examined the removal of resuspended sediments from ambient lake water by the pelagic herbivore, Daphnia pulex, in a short-term field-enclosure experiment during the spring clear-water phase. We assessed Daphnia's ability to clear the water of suspended sediments by evaluating removal of tripton (detritus and inorganic particles) by Daphnia when ambient water conditions were turbid (>100 NTU) or clear (<20 NTU) in 2 trials, conducted 2 wk apart. Treatments consisted of 6 (0, 100, 200, 400, 700, and 1000 ind/L) or 7 Daphnia densities (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 700, and 1000 ind/L) in the 1st (turbid) and 2nd (clear) trials, respectively. We used scanning electron microscopy to examine Daphnia gut contents and measured fecal-pellet settling in settling columns. In general, Daphnia presence significantly reduced both the detrital and inorganic components of tripton, but increasing Daphnia densities did not lead to increased reductions of tripton. Ambient turbidity did not alter this effect. These results indicate that Daphnia are capable of clearing resuspended sediments during both low- and high turbidity conditions, signifying that Daphnia can affect springtime water clarity in lakes with high suspended sediment concentrations. This clearing mechanism is particularly relevant in shallow lakes during spring when rapid transport of aggregates to the lake bottom could substantially increase water transparency at a time when macrophytes are regrowing from overwintering structures.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2016	35	2					589	596		10.1086/686058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/686058													WOS:000376471600011

Removal characteristics of geosmin by advanced water treatment processes: a case study around the Han River, Republic of Korea	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Water treatment plants (WTPs) that intake raw water from the Paldang Dam of the Han River have generally adopted ozone + granular activated carbon (GAC) processes for the effective removal of taste and odor substances. In recent years, the concentration and duration of the substances causing taste and odor in Paldang Lake have gradually increased. Therefore, it is necessary to review the appropriateness of the advanced water treatment processes introduced in the WTPs located in the Han River. This study attempted to compare and review two processes for geosmin removal, one using a pre-ozone GAC filter-adsorber (pre-ozone + F/A) at the B WTP and the other using a post-ozone GAC adsorber (post-ozone + GAC) at the G WTP. The results of the investigation for geosmin and 2-MIB concentrations upstream of the Paldang Dam over the past 5 years showed that 2-MIB exceeded the standard concentration for less than 5 d per year and geosmin was the main cause of taste and odor. At the B WTP in the winter of 2011, the total geosmin concentration in the treated water exceeded 20 ng/L twice. Additionally, the average total geosmin concentration of the treated water after the application of the F/A was 7.81 ng/L. On the other hand, in the case of the G WTP, the total geosmin concentration after post-ozone and GAC treatment was 0.45 ng/L. In the summer of 2012, the fraction of particulate geosmin (66.9%-82.3%) was higher than that of dissolved geosmin (17.7%-33.1%) in the raw water of the two WTPs. During this period, the average removal rates of total geosmin in the final treated water of the G WTP were 0.7% higher than that of the B WTP. Therefore, ozone injection into filtered water after removing particulate geosmin and organic substances through the standard treatment process (coagulation, sedimentation, and filtration) is thought to be effective for removal to lower the concentration of dissolved organic matter and dissolved geosmin. In conclusion, the treatment efficiency was confirmed to vary according to the stage at which the process was used, even when the same ozone + activated carbon adsorption process was used. In addition, the 'post-ozone + GAC' method is considered advantageous when introducing advanced WTPs in the Han River.

R.; Peeters, Frank; Lorke, Andreas			Active and passive vertical motion of zooplankton in a lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temporal variability of vertical zooplankton distributions is analyzed on timescales from minutes to days based on 7 months of acoustic backscatter strength data in Lake Constance. A comparison with net samples reveals that most of the observed variability in volume backscatter strength is associated with variations in the abundance of large Daphnia. Diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton was a persistent feature throughout the entire period of observation, while amplitude, daily migration timing, and migration speed varied with season. This active motion of zooplankton was affected by internal waves on a broad range of timescales. In spring, the maximum depth of DVM follows variations in isothermal depths associated with long-wavelength, basin-scale internal waves. Propagating, short-wavelength, internal waves with comparable amplitudes affect vertical zooplankton distributions on timescales of minutes. Spectral analyses of zooplankton abundance, temperature, and current velocity reveal close correspondence of spectral peaks and slopes, indicating that up to timescales of several days, the only temporal scale at which biological processes dominate over passive transport is associated with DVM. Whereas horizontal transport dominates at long periods, vertical transport occurs only at short timescales.

The dominant variations in both phytoplankton composition and environmental variables were seasonal and strongly related to the annual temperature cycle. Phytoplankton composition was annually periodic, with filamentous cyanobacteria, pennate diatoms and chlorophytes dominant in summer, while other chlorophytes, centric diatoms, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and other flagellates either dominated in other seasons or remained abundant year round. The seasonal dynamics of several major taxa could be represented by a niche response model based on temperature alone, although seasonal variations in many environmental variables likely contributed to variation in phytoplankton composition. Such seasonal variations dominated these data, but interannual variation in phytoplankton composition and environmental variables also appeared to result from dry weather late in the study.

Detailed Characterization and Monitoring of a Retrogressive Thaw Slump from Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and Identifying Associated Influence on Carbon and Nitrogen Export	REMOTE SENSING												Ice-rich permafrost landscapes are sensitive to ongoing changes in climate. Permafrost retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) represent one of the more abrupt and prolonged disturbances, which occur along Arctic river and lake shorelines. These features impact local travel and infrastructure, and there are many questions regarding associated impacts on biogeochemical cycling. Predicting the duration and magnitude of impacts requires that we enhance our knowledge of RTS geomorphological drivers and rates of change. Here we demonstrate the utility of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) for documenting the volumetric change, associated drivers and potential impacts of the largest active RTS along the Old Crow River in Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada. RPAS surveys revealed that 29,174 m(3) of sediment was exported during the initial evacuation in June 2016 and an additional 18,845 m(3) continued to be exported until June 2019. More sediment export occurred during the warmer 2017 summer that experienced less cumulative rainfall than summer 2018. However, several rain events during 2017 were of higher intensity than during 2018. Overall mean soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) within sampled thaw slump sediment was 1.36% and 0.11%, respectively. A combination of multispectral, thermal and irradiance (derived from the RPAS digital surface model) data provided detailed classification of thaw slump floor terrain types including raised dry clay lobes, shaded and relatively stable, and low-lying evacuation-prone sediments. Notably, the path of evacuation-prone sediments extended to a series of ice wedges in the northern headwall, where total irradiance was highest. Using thaw slump floor mean SOC and TN values in conjunction with sediment bulk density and thaw slump fill volume, we estimated that 713 t SOC and 58 t TN were exported to the Old Crow River during the three-year study. Findings showcase the utility of high-resolution RPAS datasets for refining our knowledge of thaw slump geomorphology and associated impacts.

Using this new version, the Fenno-Scandinavian climate and lake characteristics were studied in a set of 35-year hindcast simulations. Additionally, sensitivity tests related to the parameterization of snow albedo were conducted. Our results show that overall the new model version improves the representation of the Fenno-Scandinavian climate in terms of 2m temperature and precipitation, but the downside is that an existing wintertime cold bias in the model is enhanced. The lake surface water temperature, ice depth and ice season length were analyzed in detail for 10 Finnish, 4 Swedish and 2 Russian lakes and 1 Estonian lake. The results show that the model can reproduce these characteristics with reasonably high accuracy. The cold bias during winter causes overestimation of ice layer thickness, for example, at several of the studied lakes, but overall the values from the model are realistic and represent the lake physics well in a longterm simulation. We also analyzed the snow depth on ice from 10 Finnish lakes and vertical temperature profiles from 5 Finnish lakes and the model results are realistic.

Fine particulate matter and visibility in the Lake Tahoe Basin: Chemical characterization, trends, and source apportionment	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												Speciated PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) data has been collected for about 20 yr (1990-present) at a rural location in the Lake Tahoe Basin (Bliss State Park) and about 15 yr (1989-2004) at an urban site in South Lake Tahoe. The Bliss State Park site is representative of the Desolation Wilderness, a Class I air quality area with visibility protection under the Clean Air Act. Carbonaceous aerosol dominated reconstructed fine mass at both sites, with 58% at Bliss State Park (BLIS) and 68% at South Lake Tahoe (SOLA). Fine mass at SOLA is 2.5 times that at BLIS, mainly due to enhanced organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC). SOLA experiences a winter peak in PM2.5 mainly due to OC and EC from residential wood combustion, whereas BLIS experiences a summer peak in PM2.5 mainly due to OC and EC from wildfires. Carbonaceous aerosol dominates visibility impairment, causing about 1/2 the reconstructed aerosol light extinction at BLIS and 70% at SOLA. Trend analysis (19902009) showed statistically significant decreases in aerosol extinction at BLIS on 20% best and 60% middle visibility days and statistically insignificant upward trends on 20% worst days. SOLA (1990-2003) showed statistically significant decreases in aerosol extinction for all day categories, driven by decreasing OC and EC. From the regional haze rule baseline period of 2000-2004 until 2005-2009, BLIS saw 20% best days improving and 20% worst days getting worse due to increased wildfire effects. Receptor modeling was performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and chemical mass balance (CMB). It confirmed that (1) biomass burning dominanted PM2.5 sources at both sites with increasing importance over time; (2) low combustion efficiency burning accounts for most of the biomass burning contribution; (3) road dust and traffic contributions were much higher at SOLA than at BLIS; and (4) industrial combustion and salting were minor sources. Implications: Visibility on the 20% worst visibility days decreased at Bliss State Park, which represents the Desolation and Mokelumne Wilderness Class I areas. This decrease in visibility, contrary to Regional Haze Rule requirements, was mainly due to increased wildfire activity. Increased sulfate-caused light extinction on worst visibility days may be due to long-range transport from Asia. These factors may make it difficult to achieve reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal. Methods need to be developed to account for the effect of wildfires and intercontinental transport when evaluating progress toward the national goal.

In the primary study area, Wakomao Lake in central Alberta, no association of any pelvic phenotype with grossly defined habitats was evident. The relative frequencies of all pelvic phenotypes were stable from 1971-1977; the frequency of the form without the pelvis and spines decreased over winter. Frequencies of the subsequent generation returned to prewinter values, suggesting some cyclical seasonal variation. Causative agents for the maintenance of the frequencies were sought. The observed frequencies are not due to sampling biases, rather the most likely cause is some selective agent(s). Mass die-off of sticklebacks during midsummer O2 depletion was not differential. Other studies implicate predation by a variety of piscivores as a selective agent.																			0008-3550						1981	95	2					178	182																WOS:A1981LP68900009

Diet Niche Width and Individual Specialization of Brook Trout in Adirondack Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We evaluated diet niche width, individual diet specialization, and diet composition in six lake populations of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, a generalist predator known to exhibit benthic and pelagic trophic specialization. Population diet niche width was broad and similar across all lakes, contrasting with that of individual fish, which exhibited specialized diets in comparison with their population and other individuals. Overall, the degree of individual diet specialization was high compared with that of other fishes. The degree of individual diet specialization did not differ among study populations, although it was generally reduced in spring. Individual diet specialization was consistent across fish sizes despite observed shifts in diet composition with increasing fish length. Population diet composition varied among lakes but was consistent within lakes in all years during the 3-year study period with regard to season and fish size. The consistency and stability in measures of population diet niche width, degree of individual diet specialization, and population diet composition for Brook Trout indicate that these metrics provide useful tools for characterizing fish foraging and measuring how it changes in response to biotic and abiotic perturbations.

Frozen ponds: production and storage of methane during the Arctic winter in a lowland tundra landscape in northern Siberia, Lena River delta	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes and ponds play a key role in the carbon cycle of permafrost ecosystems, where they are considered to be hotspots of carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 emission. The strength of these emissions is, however, controlled by a variety of physical and biogeochemical processes whose responses to a warming climate are complex and only poorly understood. Small waterbodies have been attracting an increasing amount of attention since recent studies demonstrated that ponds can make a significant contribution to the CO2 and CH4 emissions of tundra ecosystems. Waterbodies also have a marked effect on the thermal state of the surrounding permafrost; during the freezing period they prolong the period of time during which thawed soil material is available for microbial decomposition. This study presents net CH4 production rates during the freezing period from ponds within a typical lowland tundra landscape in northern Siberia. Rate estimations were based on CH4 concentrations measured in surface lake ice from a variety of waterbody types. Vertical profiles along ice blocks showed an exponential increase in CH4 concentration with depth. These CH4 profiles were reproduced by a 1-D mass balance model and the net CH4 production rates were then inferred through inverse modeling. Results revealed marked differences in early winter net CH4 production among various ponds. Ponds situated within intact polygonal ground structures yielded low net production rates, of the order of 10(-11) to 10(-10) mol m(-2) s(-1) (0 : 01 to 0 : 14 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). In contrast, ponds exhibiting clear signs of erosion yielded net CH4 production rates of the order of 10(-7) mol m(-2) s(-1) (140 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). Our results therefore indicate that once a particular threshold in thermal erosion has been crossed, ponds can develop into major CH4 sources. This implies that any future warming of the climate may result in nonlinear CH4 emission behavior in tundra ecosystems.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Loss of submerged macrophytes resulting from high turbidity has become a global environmental problem in shallow lakes, associated with eutrophication. To help macrophyte recovery, application of artificial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been proposed to complement nutrient load reductions. We set up a mesocosm experiment to test if LEDs could compensate for shading effects from phytoplankton. We incubated three submerged macrophytes (Vallisneria natans, Myriophyllum spicatum and Ceratophyllum demersum) in 12 tanks of 1000 L under three artificial LED light treatments (red, blue and white) for 94 days in summer. The results showed that 1) growth of V. natans and M. spicatum was stimulated in all the LED light treatments, while C. demersum died in the end of the experiment in all treatments. The growth variables (MLShoot, DMShoot) of V. natans in blue, red and white treatments were 1.8-4.5 times greater than those in the control treatment. For M. spicatum, all plants only survived in the treatments with artificial light supplement. 2) Growing status of V. natans was similar among the treatments of different light colors, while M. spicatum grew best in the red light treatment. The results suggest that artificial light, particularly red light, can promote the recovery of submerged macrophytes in waters where impaired light climate would prevent or delay growth of macrophytes and recovery from eutrophication. Further large-scale field studies are, however, needed to fully elucidate the potential of using artificial light to stimulate growth and recovery of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes.

Variations in cyst association are inferred to reflect changes in Indian Ocean summer monsoon intensity. Several abrupt fluctuations in monsoon intensity are detected for the interval between 20 and 10 ka BP. Comparison of these fluctuations with changes in contrast between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S July insolation and the delta(18)O GRIP ice-core values suggests that different mechanisms influenced monsoon intensity at different time intervals. A general trend in monsoon intensity follows variations in insolation contrast, lagging minimum contrast by 7.5 ka and maximum contrast by 4 ka. This phase lag difference can be explained by assuming the existence of an ice/snow cover over central Asia/Tibet during glacial times. Between 18.7 and 12.5 ka BP fluctuations in SW-monsoon intensity may be forced by variations in the thermohaline ocean circulation. A rapid transition towards strong SW-monsoons at 12.5 ka BP is possibly the result of variations in atmospheric circulation and melting of the snow/ice fields in central Asia/Tibet. Variations in glacial-interglacial boundary conditions related to temperature change at northern latitudes are likely to have influenced SW-monsoon intensity between 12.5 and 10 ka BP, whereas after 10 ka BP variations in tropical land surface boundary conditions may be the dominant forcing factor.

Cellular photochemical capacity (CPC) was measured by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence before and after addition of the photosynthetic inhibitor 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU). The CPC index was useful to define an activity coefficient for the chlorophyll levels measured in boiling methanol extracts. Large variations in CPC over time or depth were generally correlated with major shifts in phytoplankton species composition. Highest CPC values were recorded during autumnal mixing. Both CPC and floristic composition of the community demonstrated as great a variation over depth during a period of stratification as that recorded over time throughout the year. The multi-canopy structure of the Wastewater phytoplankton community in summer was observed.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	1					61	78		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01242.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01242.x													WOS:A1981LC48100005
J	Holcombe, TL; Taylor, LA; Reid, DF; Warren, JS; Vincent, PA; Herdendorf, CE				Holcombe, TL; Taylor, LA; Reid, DF; Warren, JS; Vincent, PA; Herdendorf, CE			Revised Lake Erie postglacial lake level history based on new detailed bathymetry	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Holocene lake level history and paleogeography of Lake Erie are re-interpreted with the aid of new bathymetry, existing water budget data, and published information. Morphology and elevation of present and former shoreline features (sand ridges, forelands, spits, bars, and fans) record the water level at which they were formed. Of eighteen such features observed in Lake Erie, six occur nearshore and were formed at or near present lake level, and twelve features apparently formed at lower lake levels. It seems likely that lake level fell below the level of the outlet sill during the 9-6 ka climate optimum, when warmer and drier conditions prevailed. During such times lake level likely rose and fell as controlled by the water budget, within a window of constraint imposed by increases and decreases in evaporation, which would have varied directly with lake surface area. Near Buffalo, possible shoreline features occurring 3-6 km offshore at depths of 9-12 m could have formed at lower lake levels. Annual water volumes in each term of the water budget, (runoff, precipitation, and evaporation) are large relative to the volumetric capacity of Lake Erie itself. Such events as introduction of even a modest amount of upper Great Lakes water, or the onset of cooler and less dry climate conditions, could cause significant, rapid, lake level rise. Schematic reconstructions illustrate changing paleogeography and a Holocene lake level history which has varied with: blocking/ unblocking of outlet sills; erosion of outlet sills; distance from outlet sills; differential isostatic rebound, upper Great Lakes drainage flowing into or bypassing the lake; and climate-driven water budget of the Lake Erie drainage basin.																			0380-1330						2003	29	4					681	704		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70470-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70470-5													WOS:000187946400014

Assessment of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) recruitment in a regulated spawning tributary of Rainy Lake, Ontario	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Continued study of the relationship between lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) recruitment and hydroelectric dams and operations, in a variety of river systems and habitat types is needed to improve the ability to predict and monitor impacts of the hydroelectric industry on this species. Herein, we present results of a juvenile lake sturgeon study aimed at addressing concerns over an inferred lack of recruitment resulting from spawning downstream of a hydroelectric generating station (HGS). Two years of sampling (2015 and 2016) were conducted in five sections of a 41 km long reach of the Seine River, Ontario, a lake sturgeon spawning tributary of Rainy Lake. Using an established gillnetting method, deepwater habitat was targeted to capture juvenile lake sturgeon to assess relative abundance, recruitment (cohort strength), and growth. Deepwater habitat, defined as water depths >6 m in this system, comprised only 2.1% of the wetted area in this study area. Within these habitats, a total of 331 lake sturgeon capture events were observed over the 2-years study period. The majority of the lake sturgeon catch (85%) was comprised of age-0 to age-5 individuals (both sampling years combined). Although inter-annual variation in cohort strength was apparent, each cohort between 2006 and 2016 was represented. The spatial distribution of cohorts varied among river reaches with younger individuals (age-0 and age-1) occupying reaches proximal to the Sturgeon Falls HGS, and larger, older individuals (age-2 to age-5) occupying reaches further downstream. The rarity of age-6+ individuals can likely be explained by ongoing downstream redistribution of juveniles over time, out of the Seine River and into Rainy Lake. Growth of juvenile lake sturgeon captured in the Seine River was above average relative to conspecifics from other rivers in the Hudson Bay drainage. Unfortunately, baseline data sets required to facilitate comparisons of contemporary (post-construction Sturgeon Falls HGS) versus historical (i.e. pre- Sturgeon Falls HGS) lake sturgeon recruitment, or to evaluate the influence of the Seine River Water Management Plan (2004) on lake sturgeon recruitment, are lacking. However, juvenile Lake Sturgeon are more abundant in this system than what had been surmised based on recent studies which implemented random sampling. Results indicate that juvenile lake sturgeon may reside in spawning tributaries for several years (age-0 to age-5) prior to seeking alternate habitats and highlights the value of targeted sampling (i.e. by depth) along the flow axis of rivers downstream of spawning areas when assessing lake sturgeon recruitment patterns.

Distribution and broadscale habitat relations of the wolverine in the contiguous United States	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Conservation of the wolverine (Gulo gulo) at the southern extent of its North American range requires reliable understandings of past and present distribution patterns and broad-scale habitat relations. We compiled 820 verifiable and documented records of wolverine occurrence (specimens, DNA detections, photos, and accounts of wolverines being killed or captured) in the contiguous United States from museums, the literature, and institutional archives. We spatially referenced 729 records with areal precision <= 1 township (93.2 km(2)) and temporal precision <= 10 years. Historical records (1827-1960) were located primarily in the western mountains and Great Lakes region. However, our data suggest that the historical distribution of wolverines in the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada was disjunct, contradicting previous interpretations. Our results indicate that wolverine range in the contiguous United States had contracted substantially by the mid-1900s. Current records (1995-2005) are limited to north-central Washington, northern and central Idaho, western Montana, and northwestern Wyoming, We investigated potential relations between wolverines and alpine vegetation, cold temperatures, and spring snow cover by comparing the distribution of historical wolverine records with Kuchler's potential natural vegetation types, Holdridge's climatic life zones, and EASE snow-cover maps during the latter portion of the wolverine denning period (15 Apr-14 May). In the western mountains, historical wolverine records generally occurred in or near alpine vegetation and climatic conditions, especially at the limits of their distribution in the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and southern Rocky Mountains. However, the only habitat layer that fully accounted for historical distribution patterns was spring snow cover. Causal factors for the extirpation of wolverines from the southern portions of their range in the contiguous United States are unknown, but are likely related to high levels of human-caused mortality and low to nonexistent immigration rates.																			0022-541X					SEP	2007	71	7					2147	2158		10.2193/2006-548	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-548													WOS:000249351100008

Peaks in bacterial biomass developed shortly after flooding, coinciding with the initial leaching of organic nutrients from vegetation submerged under floodwater, and again at high water, shortly before the climax of phytoplankton biomass. Rods predominated the bacterial carbon biomass. Phytoplankton developed a postflood bloom at initial falling, corresponding to the drainage of the lake water into the river. While minimal biomass occurred during the advent of flooding, most likely due to disturbance and dilution. Algal biomass was usually dominated by Chlorophyta. Highest biomass of zooplankton was recorded at the end of the flooding in connection with the decline in turbidity, and once again at early drainage, closely associated with high phytoplankton biomass. Copepods (mainly nauplii) always constituted the majority of zooplankton carbon biomass. Peaks in detrital carbon concentrations were recorded at rising and falling water phases, corresponding respectively to the riverine discharge and decomposition of macrophyte mats. At rising water phase, CPOC was abundant. While during other water phases, this predominance was shifted to FPOC alone. Taken together, average contribution of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus to total seston carbon was 3.29, 21.21, 6.83 and 68.67 %, respectively.																			0003-9136					DEC	1992	126	2					213	238																WOS:A1992KD31200006

Methylmercury (MeHg) was analysed in the original water sample (MeHg-whl) and in the humic fraction (MeHg-hum). The MeHg-hum increased with increasing concentration of humic substances (HS; measured as absorbance at 254 nm) in the water. A seasonal variation of the MeHg-hum/TOC ratio was superimposed on a negative relationship to the water flow, which indicates that the methylation is a slow process which results in a rapid drainage of the storage during periods of high flow. A minimum of the MeHg-whl/TOC ratio observed during the spring flood was followed by a slow increase during the rest of the year.

Its mixolimnion reaches from the surface down to 10-m depth. A dense population of phototrophic bacteria dominated by Chromatium okenii is located in the subsequent 2-m layer containing up to 200 mg bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) m(-3). Maximum cell concentration was found at 10.8-m depth during the summer season. The light intensity at the upper edge of the bacterial layer averages 4.7% of the subsurface radiation (at 0.05 m depth) and at the density peak of the layer it averages 0.4%. Variations over the summer season in the photosynthetic properties of the bacterial population at the depth of highest cell density have been observed in in situ C-14-CO2 incorporation experiments. These changes are random, and no photoadaptation effect was found. Thus, the population of phototrophic bacteria was physiologically uniform during the investigation period and it had the following photosynthetic properties (medians for the 25th and 75th percentiles are in parentheses): P-max, 0.154 mg C (mg Bchl)(-1) h(-1) (0.048, 0.174); I-k, 0.016 mol quanta m(-2) h(-1) (0.012, 0.019); alpha, 7.7 mg C (mg Bchl)(-1) h(-1) (mol quanta m(-2) h(-1))(-1) (4.8, 11.6). The specific dark production rate was 0.016 mg C (mg Bchl)(-1) h(-1) (0.014, 0.023). The average quantum yield for CO2 assimilation at the depth of maximum cell density, phi(z), was low at 0.012 (0.007, 0.020). The cells were sensitive to light intensities higher than the optimum found at similar to 0.036 mol quanta m(-2) h(-1). Maximum inhibition by excessive light was determined to be 80% at light intensities >0.108 mol quanta m(-2) h(-1) (=30 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) when cells were exposed for periods of 2.5 h or longer. The bacterial biomass increment assuming no losses, mu*, was calculated to be 0.05 d(-1) (0.03, 0.08) and the loss rate, lambda, to be 0.03 d(-1) (-0.10, 0.06).																			0024-3590					SEP	1998	43	6					1262	1269		10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1262	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1262													WOS:000076791700020

Depositional Facies and Sequence Stratigraphy of Kodiak Butte, Western Delta of Jezero Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												High-resolution 2D and 3D data remotely acquired by SuperCam's Remote Micro-Imager and Mastcam-Z aboard the Perseverance rover enabled us to characterize the stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary record of the Kodiak butte, an isolated remnant of the western delta fan of Jezero crater. Using these data, we build up on previous interpretations of the butte interpreted as a prograding Gilbert-type deltaic series. We characterize three individual stratigraphic Units 0 to 2 on the eastern and northern faces of the butte. Each Unit displays the same vertical succession of prodeltaic/lacustrine bottomsets, delta slope toesets and foresets, and fluvially influenced topsets of a deltaic plain with a braided river pattern, shown by 11 individual sedimentary facies. We infer that these individual Units record the formation of three distinct deltaic mouth bars successively across time and space. For the first time on another planet than Earth, we are able to construct a precise sequence stratigraphic framework to highlight lake-level fluctuations at the time the Kodiak butte was emplaced, during the latest stages of deltaic activity. We identify four hydrogeological cycles indicated by alternating rises and falls of the lake-level on the order of 5-10 m. These were most probably linked to climatic events and variations controlling lake water inputs in probable relation to an astronomical control. Kodiak butte is an isolated remnant of the main western sedimentary fan of Jezero crater. It displays the characteristic structures of a Gilbert-type delta, a structure that shows deposition of fluvial material into a standing body of water, here interpreted to be a lake within Jezero crater. 11 individual sedimentary facies (textures, grain-sizes, and structures) of the rocks exposed at Kodiak suggest that the depositional environments ranged from the fluvial plain to a steep subaqueous slope and into the bottom of the shallow Jezero lake. Our observations further show that Kodiak butte is organized into three distinct stratigraphic Units (0-2), each displaying the same vertical succession of bottomsets, toesets, foresets and topsets. This architecture is interpreted as reflecting three distinct deltaic packages, formed consecutively and not at the same time. Using these facies and stratigraphic architecture data, we are able for the first time on another planet than Earth, to precisely construct a sequence stratigraphic framework for the formation of Kodiak. This framework illustrates with unprecedented precision successive episodes of rises and falls of the paleo-lake-level (in the order of 5-10 m) involved in the construction and evolution of the western Jezero delta. New observations on the Kodiak delta remnant were carried out to characterize its detailed facies and stratigraphic architecture Three deltaic mouth bars are identified showing 4D succession of depositional settings ranging from deltaic plain to slope to shallow lake The first ever sequence stratigraphic framework on Mars shows four cycles of alternating rises and falls of the lake-level within 5-10 m					Kah, Linda/J-3754-2019; Maurice, Sylvestre/OBO-3026-2025; CARAVACA, Gwénaël/AAP-1373-2021; Stack Morgan, Kathryn/AGY-7985-2022; Núñez, Jorge/J-4027-2015; Mangold, Nicolas/HMV-9267-2023; Gupta, Sanjeev/JUF-5203-2023; Farley, Kenneth/AAE-7735-2020	Le Mouelic, Stephane/0000-0001-5260-1367; CARAVACA, Gwenael/0000-0002-4138-0471; Mangold, Nicolas/0000-0002-0022-0631; Gupta, Sanjeev/0000-0001-6415-1332; Tate, Christian/0000-0003-3467-0099; `Randazzo, Nicolas/0000-0002-5551-8224; Kah, Linda/0000-0001-7172-2033													2169-9097	2169-9100				APR	2024	129	4							e2023JE008205	10.1029/2023JE008205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JE008205													WOS:001199154900001

Results show that reed vegetation is highly productive (high NDVI) although local factors, such as lake water level (Trasimeno), the presence of brackish waters (Goro) or the presence of eutrophic waters (Mantova) can influence reed growth and vigour. In the case of Lake Garda we evaluated the effect of winter snowing and results confirmed that management had no detrimental effect on reed vigour although its effect is often inter-related with other local factors.					; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; STROPPIANA, DANIELA/0000-0002-5619-4305; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988													1129-8596						2009	41	2					125	137																WOS:000267694000010

The overall average of fourteen bulk deposition fluxes for PAHs was 3300+/-15100 ng m(-2) d(-1). PAH depositions showed a seasonal variation and they were higher in winter months. This was probably due to increases in residential heating activities and decreases in atmospheric mixing layer levels. Ambient air samples, measured with a high volume air sampler, were collected from the same site. The average total concentration including gas and particulate phase was about 300+/-420 ng m(-3) and it was in the range of previously reported values. Some of the ambient air and bulk deposition samples were collected simultaneously in dry periods. Both concurrently measured values were used to calculate the dry deposition velocities whose overall average value was 0.45+/-0.35cm s(-1). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

No qualitative changes were observed in the bottom fauna, except for the introduction of a Baikalian gammarid species, Gmelinoides fasciatus. The average total biomass in June (without big molluscs) revealed considerable annual fluctuations, with an insignificant general tendency of increase. The increase was significant in the biomass of several Mollusca (including the highly abundant big clam Dreissena polymorpha), Asellus, Gammaridae, and Hirudinea but not in the most abundant animal groups Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. The low biomass of Ephemeroptera and Hydrachnellae decreased significantly. The mid-summer samples taken from the shallow-water zone in three different years revealed the highest biomass in 1980 and the lowest in 1990 (the latter being probably related to the high water level). A gradual decrease in the biomass of the Ephemeroptera and Hydrachnellae as well as the Oligochaeta, Pisidiidae and Bithynia tentaculata occurred in the shallow-water zone, while the Gammaridae increased on the account of the introduced species. No coincidence was found with the neighbouring Lake Vortsjarv when comparing the annual fluctuations of biomass. A general tendency to a slow increase in total biomass and a decrease in the biomass of the most vulnerable groups Ephemeroptera and Hydrachnellae, probably due to progressing eutrophication, were common for both lakes.

A meshless Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique was adopted to simulate the highly fragmented violent flow generated by the falling slide in the artificial reservoir. The speed-up achievable via General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GP-GPU) allowed to adopt the adequate resolution to describe the phenomenon. The comparison with the data available in literature showed that the results of the numerical simulation reproduce satisfactorily the maximum run-up, also the water surface elevation in the residual lake after the event. Moreover, the 3D velocity field of the flow during the event and the discharge hydrograph which overtopped the dam, were obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Precise effects of any extreme weather event depend not only on the type of event and its timing, but also on the ecosystem affected. Here the cascade of effects following the arrival of an atmospheric river (directed by record-breaking Storm Desmond) across terrestrial, freshwater and coastal zones is quantified, using the Burrishoole system on the Atlantic coast of Ireland as a natural observatory. We used a network of high-frequencyin-situsensors to capture in detail the effects of an unprecedented period of rainfall, high wind speeds and above-average winter air temperatures on catchment and estuarine dynamics. In the main freshwater lake, water clarity decreased and acidity increased during Storm Desmond. Surface heat input, due to a warm and moist above-lake air mass, was rapidly distributed throughout the water column. River discharge into the downstream coastal basin was estimated to be the highest on record (since 1976), increasing the buoyancy flux by an order of magnitude and doubling the water column stratification stability. Entrainment of salt into the outflowing freshwater plume exported resident salt from the inner estuarine basin, resulting in net salt loss. Here, the increased stratification markedly reinforced isolation of the bottom waters, promoting deoxygenation. Measurements of current between the inner estuarine basin and the adjacent coastal waters indicated a 20-fold increase in the volume of seaward flowing low-salinity water, as a result of storm rainfall over the watershed. Storm impacts spanned the full catchment-to-coast continuum and these results provide a glimpse into a potential future for hydrological systems where these severe hydroclimatic events are expected to occur more frequently.

We studied the petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry and microfossil assemblages in the Quaternary, first terrace of Dangxiong Co.Limnocytherellinawas the most common ostracode in the first terrace and prefers warm-humid conditions. Grainy ankerite in the terrace exhibits obvious overgrowth edges and uneven surfaces. Rare earth elements and Y distribution patterns in the first terrace show moderate rare earth enrichment, whereas Eu and Dy show weak negative and positive anomalies, respectively. These features indicate that the first terrace in Dangxiong Co is composed of lacustrine hydrothermal deposits. Moreover, the delta B-11 value of the Quaternary travertine is low, reflecting the low values in hydrothermal waters of the Quaternary. We suggest that hydrothermal water has been an important source of boron in the Quaternary. The three rivers on the south side of Dangxiong Co contribute 95% of the B2O3. The geochemical characteristics and the delta B-11 values of the waters in these three rivers are the same as in waters from Maerzuo hot spring. Thus, the hot spring is still the main source of boron to Dangxiong Co. These results have important implications for future exploration of borate deposits in salt lakes.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2020	64	3					167	178		10.1007/s10933-020-00129-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00129-x		JUL 2020											WOS:000545178700001

REPETITIVE SYNOPTIC SAMPLING OF THE SPRING APHANIZOMENON BLOOMS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												N fixation (as acetylene reduction) and factors most likely to influence it were estimated simultaneously for 31 sites at 8 stages of the 1971 and 1972 spring blooms of Aphanizomenon in naturally eutrophic Clear Lake [California, USA]. The major factor controlling rates of N2 fixation was the number of Aphanizomenon heterocysts (P < 0.001). Environmental influences on fixation were largely mediated through heterocyst induction or repression. Regression analysis showed heterocysts highly negatively related to NO3 (P < 0.05). At high (linear regressions) but not at low (log-transformed regressions) numbers, heterocysts were positively correlated with phosphate (P < 0.05). At low rates of N2 fixation, heterocysts were also positively related to water clarity, chlorophyll (both P < 0.05), and temperature (P < 0.01). The role of very low levels of nitrate (2-22 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 NO3-N) in (apparently) indirectly suppressing heterocyst induction was unexpected. Only at high rates was N2 fixation correlated with phosphate. Presumably at low rates sufficient P is available in this P-rich lake (14-43 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 PO4-P) to permit repression of heterocyst formation by low NO3 levels. Ammonium suppressed N2 fixation and heterocyst formation only where it was present in relatively large quantities (20-170 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 NH4-N). Early in the blooms, low rates of vegetative (i.e. nonheterocyst) N2 fixation were indicated in the flake colonies of Aphanizomenon. These may have an anoxic center like that of Trichodesmium.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	2					316	328		10.4319/lo.1979.24.2.0316	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.2.0316													WOS:A1979GS84700009

Putting the Younger Dryas cold event into context	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Younger Dryas event is by far the best studied of the millennial-scale cold snaps of glacial time. Yet its origin remains a subject of debate. The long-held scenario that the Younger Dryas was a one-time outlier triggered by a flood of water stored in proglacial Lake Agassiz has fallen from favor due to lack of a clear geomorphic signature at the correct time and place on the landscape. The recent suggestion that the Younger Dryas was triggered by the impact of a comet has not gained traction. Instead, evidence from Chinese stalagmites suggests that, rather than being a freak occurrence, the Younger Dryas is an integral part of the deglacial sequence of events that produced the last termination on a global scale.

Among the factors addressed by these orders is the protection of Lac St. Louis from any increase in flooding due to regulation of Lake Ontario outflows. The existing regulation plan, Plan 1958-D,was designed using the 1860-1954 water supplies to the Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence System to regulate flows to meet these criteria Plan 1958-D has performed well in this regard but, since regulation commenced, the system has received several water supply sequences outside the plan's design range. Limitations within Plan 1958-D have led to deviations from the plan to minimize flood and low water impacts in the Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence River system during these extreme supply periods. In addition, since the Commission formulated its regulation criteria in the 1950's, the interests in the system have evolved. This paper examines the effects that Lake Ontario outflow regulation have had on Lac St Louis spring water levels in the years since 1990. It will show that extreme flood levels of Lac St Louis were reduced in the case of actual regulation compared to what they would have been with application of Plan 1958-D without deviation and with unregulated conditions.																					1-896513-02-6				1996		6					112	124																WOS:A1996BH53J00013

Characteristics of vertical CH(4) distribution and ranges of methane transformation rates were determined and found to depend upon the lake productivity as well as seasonal and daily fluctuations of hydrological and hydrochemical parameters. The highest rate of MO was registered in highly eutrophic lakes during summer stagnation under conditions of formation of a distinct metalimnial water layer with MO up to 0.4-1.2 ml CH(4)/(l day). Under the same conditions, a maximum amount of bacterioplankton (6-13 x 10(6) cells/ml) was detected and CO(2) bacterial dark assimilation (DA) reached 50-72 mu g C/(l day).

As a lake parameterisation scheme FLake is implemented into the limited-area NWP model COSMO. Results from a numerical experiment with the coupled COSMO-FLake system, including the complete COSMO-model data assimilation cycle, indicate a good performance with respect to the lake surface temperature and to the freeze-up of lakes and the ice break-up. The use of FLake removes a significant overestimation of the lake surface temperature during winter that is typical of the routine COSMO sea surface temperature analysis. Some challenging issues are discussed, such as the development of external-parameter fields and the lake temperature spin-up following a cold start of FLake in an NWP or climate model.

Occupational injuries and diseases among commercial fishers in Finland 1996-2015	INTERNATIONAL MARITIME HEALTH												Background: Commercial fishing is recognised as one of the most hazardous professions worldwide. In Finland, commercial fishing has some special characteristics, including fishing on ice during frozen waters, and pluriactivity of the fisher family to gain additional income. The goal of this study was to describe injury characteristics among commercial fishers in Finland during the years 1996-2015. With this information, we wish to promote creation of effective safety campaigns and interventions. Materials and methods: The data for this study was acquired from The Farmers' Social Insurance Institution, who handles the mandatory pension and occupational injury insurance of Finnish commercial fishers. Descriptive statistics was used to categorise and analyse the data that comprised the anonymised insurance history of 1954 insured fishers and reports on 1135 compensated injuries, 11 fatalities, and 53 occupational disease cases. Results: The results show, that the injury rate of Finnish commercial fishers is high. Forty per cent of the fishing-related injuries occur aboard or when entering or leaving the vessel, while 37% happened ashore, and 11% on sea or lake ice. The most common type of incident is preceded by a slip, trip, or sway followed by a fall to lower level. The injuries result in a median disability length of 21 days. An elevated risk for Finnish (vs. Swedish) speaking, as well as for male fishers was found. The occupational diseases of the studied population were for the most part results of manual, repetitive and/or physically straining work due to e.g. hauling in fishing equipment. Due to small numbers and lack of case data, it is not possible to make any further analysis of the 11 fatalities, which were all drownings. Conclusions: Based on our findings, injury prevention should be targeted, besides preventing fatalities because of drowning, at mitigating the risks for slips, trips, and falls both aboard and ashore.

While most studies have focused on the effects of warming on arctic vegetation and nutrient cycling, little is known about how belowground communities, such as fungi root-associated, respond to warming. Here, we investigate how long-term summer warming affects ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. We used Ion Torrent sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to compare ECM fungal communities in plots with and without long-term experimental warming in both dry and moist tussock tundra. Cortinarius was the most OTU-rich genus in the moist tundra, while the most diverse genus in the dry tundra was Tomentella. On the diversity level, in the moist tundra we found significant differences in community composition, and a sharp decrease in the richness of ECM fungi due to warming. On the functional level, our results indicate that warming induces shifts in the extramatrical properties of the communities, where the species with medium-distance exploration type seem to be favored with potential implications for the mobilization of different nutrient pools in the soil. In the dry tundra, neither community richness nor community composition was significantly altered by warming, similar to what had been observed in ECM host plants. There was, however, a marginally significant increase in OTUs identified as ECM fungi with the medium-distance exploration type in the warmed plots. Linking our findings of decreasing richness with previous results of increasing ECM fungal biomass suggests that certain ECM species are favored by warming and may become more abundant, while many other species may go locally extinct due to direct or indirect effects of warming. Such compositional shifts in the community might affect nutrient cycling and soil organic C storage.

The question arises whether stock management can be adapted to mitigate the consequences of this climatic change. Here, we estimate the effects of increasing water temperatures on fisheries yield and population dynamics of whitefish, a typical cold-water fish species. Using a process-based population model calibrated on an empirical long-term data set for the whitefish population (Coregonus lavaretus (L.) species complex) of the pre-alpine Lake Irrsee, Austria, we project density-dependent and temperature-dependent population growth and compare established stock enhancement strategies to alternative stocking strategies under the aspect of increasing water temperatures and cost neutrality. Additionally, we contrast the results obtained from the process-based model to the results from simple regression models and argue that the latter show qualitative inadequacies in projecting catch with rising temperatures. Our results indicate that increasing water temperatures reduce population biomass between 2.6% and 7.9% and catch by the fishery between 24% and 48%, depending on temperature scenario and natural mortality calculation. These reductions are caused by accelerated growth, smaller asymptotic size and lower annual survival of whitefish. Regarding stocking strategies under constant temperatures, we find that stocking mostly whitefish larvae, produces higher population biomass than stocking mostly one-summer-old whitefish, while catch remains almost constant. With increasing temperatures, stocking one-summer-old fish is more beneficial for the angling fishery. Adaption to climate change by changing stocking strategies cannot, however, prevent an overall reduction in catch and population size of this cold-water fish species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Danilov, R; Ekelund, NGA				Danilov, R; Ekelund, NGA			The efficiency of seven diversity and one similarity indices based on phytoplankton data for assessing the level of eutrophication in lakes in central Sweden	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seven diversity and one similarity indices calculated on the basis of phytoplankton data were studied for their usefulness for eutrophication studies in lakes in central Sweden. The lakes of different eutrophication levels (eutrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic) were investigated monthly during autumn 1998. All of the diversity indices calculated (Hurlbert's, Margalefs, Menhinick's, Shannon's, Simpson's, McNaughton's and Species Number) failed to distinguish between different levels of eutrophication. However, the use of similarity index based on presence-ab sence matrices of phytoplankton species proved its high efficiency for eutrophication studies in the lakes in central Sweden. The consideration of abundance, additionally to presence-absence data, was concluded not to be as efficient as only presence-absence matrices. We recommend the use of similarity index based on presence-absence matrices of phytoplankton species as a good tool for the assessment of the level of eutrophication in the lakes studied.

Understanding the mechanisms behind partial migration is of major importance for the understanding of population dynamics and, eventually, ecosystem processes. We studied the effects of food availability on the seasonal partial migration of cyprinid fish from a lake to connected streams during winter by the use of passive telemetry. Fish with increased access to food were found to migrate in higher proportion, earlier in the season, and to reside in the streams for a longer period compared to fish with decreased access to food. Furthermore, fewer unfed migrants returned to the lake, indicating higher overwinter mortality. Our results suggest that individual fish trade off safety from predation and access to food differently depending on their body condition, which results in a condition-dependent partial migration. Hence, our main conclusion is that individual decision-making is based on assessment of own condition which offers a mechanistic explanation to partial migration. Moreover, this may be of high importance for understanding population responses to environmental variation as well as ecosystem dynamics and stability.

Charcoal and pollen analyses were conducted to examine the regional Holocene fire history and discuss its possible relationship with both climatic changes and anthropogenic activities. Our results show extremely low charcoal influxes between 9.5 and 3.5 cal ka BP, revealing low fire frequency. Meanwhile, high proportions of arboreal pollen demonstrated expansion of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. This phase is consistent with heavy precipitation during the early-mid Holocene. After 3.5 cal ka BP., the abrupt increases in fire frequency revealed by core GY1 and LTY were closely related to gradual drying towards the late Holocene, possibly due to the Asian Summer Monsoon weakening and activation of the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Our pollen records also reveal this drying trend after the mid-Holocene, demonstrating a regional retreat of subtropical evergreen forests and local development of Glyptostrobus-dominated wetland community around the LTY and GY1 sites. However, the intensified fires after 3.5 cal ka BP probably resulted mainly from increasing human activities during the Shang-Zhou Bronze age. Pollen results show severe damage of forest by fires, indicated by notable decrease of arboreal pollen and increase of Dicranopteris and herbs. After 2.0 ka, obvious growth of Poaceae, Dicranopteris and Pinus recorded in the GY1 and LTY cores demonstrate agriculture development in low-altitude plains and hills, coinciding with the first human population boom and big progress in agricultural technology during the Warring States to Western Han Dynasty period. Signs of profound human impacts and extensive agriculture in South China appeared after 1.0 cal ka BP, which is revealed by frequent local fires and intensified anthropogenic impact around the mountains sites (SZY and GT-2). Generally, our results reveal a gradual expansion of anthropogenic activities into elevated areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	McGowran, B; Li, QY				McGowran, B; Li, QY			Miocene climatic oscillation recorded in the Lakes Entrance oil shaft, southern Australia: Reappraisal of the planktonic foraminiferal record	MICROPALEONTOLOGY												The stratigraphic section at Lakes Entrance accumulated on a narrow platform in a neritic environment, close to the interaction of the East Australian Current and the West Wind Drift. The biostratigraphic succession of planktonic foraminiferal events first presented by D.G. Jenkins in 1960 has been slightly revised and correlated with the integrated Miocene geochronology. To extend biostratigraphy to ecostratigraphy, we have revised the systematics and nomenclature of the planktonic taxa and profiled the faunal succession in sixteen assemblages falling into three groups. 1, From the later middle Miocene to late Miocene occurred assemblages XI to XVI, typified by the collapse of woodi/bulloides ratio and resurgence of spinose species, as well as a comeback by the cancellate and globorotaliid forms. 2, Assemblages IX to X range from the latest early Miocene to early middle Miocene (upper N7 to N10 equivalents), with greatest amplitudes in fluctuation in species diversity and other metrics. 3, The early Miocene contained assemblages I to VIlI, in which a rising woodi/bulloides ratio was accompanied by abundant microperforates but decline in spinose and cancellate species and in the planktonic/benthic ratio. At the second order or 10(7) years' scale, the Exxon sealevel curve rises sporadically through the early Miocene and falls sporadically to its lowest level in the late Miocene, broadly congruent with the pelagic oxygen isotopes, which indicate an early Miocene rise and a major decline into the late middle Miocene. At the third order and 10(6) years' scale, there may be promise of synchrony between the Mi glacial cycles and the marginal sequences. It is noteworthy that, at Lakes Entrance, there are about ten putatively global sequence boundaries and ten Mi glaciations spanning the time in which fifteen neritic faunal assemblages were recognized. Spikes in the woodi/bulloides ratio fit between the Mi glaciations and fall in the vicinity of maximum flooding surfaces. However, they fit lows, not highs, in planktonic diversity and planktonic/benthic ratios, suggesting intensified estuarine-type runoff as the control in this neritic setting. The perturbation in all measures increased in the 1.5 m.y. spanning assemblages IX and X straddling the early/middle Miocene boundary. At this time of peak warming and transgression, of stratification of pelagic water and planktonic communities, and bunching of third-order sequences, the biosphere was at its most sensitive and volatile and most responsive to perturbations (which led the big drops in climate and sealevel).																			0026-2803					SUM	1997	43	2					129	148		10.2307/1485778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1485778													WOS:A1997XJ72100002

While conservation and recovery programs increasingly implement flow management actions to promote successful migration and spawning, uncertainty regarding how spawning migration phenology responds to changing environmental conditions can limit the ability to effectively target such recovery actions. Here, we use a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework to analyse spawning migration phenology of individually tagged June suckers (Chasmistes liorus) - a federally threatened, long-lived, iteroparous, adfluvial species endemic to Utah Lake (Utah, USA) and its tributaries. We then examine how annual hydrologic and thermal conditions relate to different components of annual migration phenology, including peak migration date, in-stream residence time, and among-individual variation in migration timing. Peak migration date occurred earlier in years with warmer spring air temperatures (a proxy for water temperatures), though this effect interacted with peak runoff timing. Both residence time and among-individual variation in migration timing were greater in years with larger spring discharge and later peak flows. Residence time was also longer in warmer years. These results highlight how natural and anthropogenic changes to river flow and thermal regimes are likely to impact June sucker migration timing and duration, and our approach can be applied to other migratory species to identify the external drivers of the different components of migration phenology.					; Heinle, Kadie/NXY-4959-2025	fonken, dale/0000-0003-2626-8526; Walsworth, Timothy/0000-0002-7352-3430													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2024	33	4								10.1111/eff.12791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12791		MAY 2024											WOS:001234883100001

Many different analogues have been proposed to help to understand them, including travertines, lacustrine mounds and alkaline lake deposits, amongst others. Interpretation and genesis of these special facies involve discussions about biogenic vs. abiogenic formation of these branched components, relation with Mg-clays, role of microbes and growth of spherulites, amongst others. The present work shows some examples at microscale from a drilled core from Santos Basin (Brazil). The analyses of the shrub-like crystals present in the studied section allowed the distinction between four different types: (i) Type 1: fan-shaped fibrous-radial crystals; (ii) Type 2: fan-shaped, branched fibrous-radial crystals; (iii) Type 3: dendrite crystals; and (iv) Type 4: laminated crusts. All these components show similarities with their counterparts present in travertines, suggesting similar conditions controlling crystal growth in both Presalt and travertines. However, microfacies relationships show clear differences between the Pre-salt and those from travertine in the literature. Such Pre-salt microfacies presented here show a clear relationship between the development of the so called shrub-like crystals and the environment's energy, allowing the establishment of a proximal-distal pattern within a lacustrine environment as well as the identification of microfacies that could be related to (subaqueous?) hydrothermal vents. Distinction between the different types of branched components described here as well as their relationships with other microfacies are critical issues for the differentiation of the processes involved and the interpretation of the environments of formation (e.g., spring-related and proximal-distal environments within a lake). The observations made on samples froma drilled core of Brazilian's Pre-salt allowthe discussion on some topics and interpretations involving the Pre-salt facies, providing potential research guidelines on these challenging continental carbonates.

This study developed an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data interpretation via multivariate statistics and stable isotope analysis for the quantitative evaluation of the GSI characteristics. Through field hydrogeological investigation and sampling, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of water chemistry parameters and isotopic tracers have been conducted to identify the areas and properties of GSI across spatial scales. As the geological and hydrogeological conditions in the seasonal frozen area are complex and affected by human activities and winter freezing and thawing, the GSI in the dry season had obvious segmentation, and the GSIs were different on both sides of some reaches. The outcomes of Q-mode HCA and PCA indicated that EC and redox conditions are the main identification factors of hydrochemistry of groundwater and GSI. The results from this study provided insightful information for us to understand the major impact factors of GSI, as well as the water resources distributions.					; Du, Xinqiang/AAC-5263-2021; Dai, Zhenxue/AAA-2563-2019	/0000-0002-4297-2292; 													1747-6585	1747-6593				NOV	2021	35	4					1348	1361		10.1111/wej.12734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12734		JUN 2021											WOS:000658061600001

The river main stem flows approximately 6,300 km from west to east through 11 provinces, eventually emptying into the East China Sea. The total basin area of the Yangtze River provides more than 40% of China's gross domestic product, sustains nearly 500 million people, and plays a vital role in the overall socioeconomic development of China. Because of longitudinal differences in geomorphology, the Yangtze River is often divided into upper, middle, and lower reaches for the purposes of study and description. In general, the Yangtze River basin has a warm climate and abundant rainfall. The subtropical monsoon climate accounts for 70-80% of its annual rainfall, which produces predictable annual flood events during summers of each year. The Yangtze River ecosystem also has diverse aquatic habitats that support high biodiversity. The Yangtze River main stem contains more than 3,000 tributaries and approximately 4,000 lakes that provide important habitats for thousands of aquatic species, which include 378 fish species. Yet, the ecological communities of the Yangtze River have been dramatically impacted in recent decades due to high degrees of anthropogenic activities associated with the economic development of China. Significant biodiversity declines occurring throughout the basin have been largely attributed to hydropower dam construction, overexploitation of major fisheries, water pollution, and habitat fragmentation. In addition, widespread disconnection of the Yangtze River main stem from its floodplain lakes, lake reclamation projects, invasions by exotic species, and other serious ecological problems threaten the survival of the remaining aquatic resources in the basin. To offset the adverse effects of these threats, a number of nature reserves have been established. Additionally, protection and restoration measures, including spring fishing closures, artificial population enhancement strategies, and complete habitat restoration projects, have been implemented throughout the basin. Although these projects have yielded some encouraging results to date, they are still considered inadequate. It is recommended that an integrated strategy that includes cross-functional communication mechanisms, more comprehensive monitoring, ecological rehabilitation, and government legislation is still needed. This will insure that utilization and development in the Yangtze River ecosystem are sustainable and balanced with conservation and ecological needs.

J	OLSSON, H				OLSSON, H			REFLECTANCE CALIBRATION OF THEMATIC MAPPER DATA FOR FOREST CHANGE DETECTION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Landsat-5 TM images over a forest area in Sweden were calibrated to reflectance. Using images for each summer from 1984 to 1991, changes in the sensor response offset were found for TM bands 1 to 4. The aerosol optical thicknesses were estimated from horizontal visibility and the sensor deterioration was estimated by assuming a constant lake reflectance. The reflectance changes to be detected in a forest are small compared with the differences between absolute calibrated images. Statistical relative calibration, followed by the scaling of the residuals to reflectance, is therefore recommended for making local reflectance changes comparable over time.																			0143-1161					JAN 10	1995	16	1					81	96		10.1080/01431169508954373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431169508954373													WOS:A1995QE99000006

The length of the main water course is 29.11 km, having its spring at the altitude of 970 m being a left tributary of the Bistrita River with the output in the Piatra Neamt City center. In the superior basin in the summer of 1991, following extensive landslides which blocked the Cuejdi River valley, the largest natural dam lake in Romania was formed, Cuejdel Lake. These water resources are well known for their excellent quality but lately due to increasing anthropic pressure, the quality decreased significantly. This paper seeks to prove the human interference in the state of the Cuejdi hydrographic basin using the Water Quality Index (WQI). Water quality status assessment can be defined as the evaluation of physical, chemical, biological state of the water in relation with the natural state, anthropogenic effects and future uses. WQI provides a single value expressing the average quality of water at a time, based on analytical values of physic -chemical parameters. In computing the WQI were used five physic -chemical parameters: pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4). WQI is a 100 point scale that summarizes results from different measurements that can be divided into several ranges corresponding to quality classes, 100 being the highest score. The measurements include - 30 sampling points from the middle and inferior sectors of the river and 12 from the superior basin - Cuejdel Lake. Using WQI allowed the comparison of the two aquatic environments, differences in their quality being noticed. In the Cuejdel lake catchment as there are little anthropic influences and impacted mostly by natural environmental variables, the water quality is good with an average index of 86. Based on the WQI values the results revealed a classification of the river in three main quality sectors. The first one is the sector between the confluence of Cuejdi with Tiganca creek with a an index of 75 followed by the sector between Cuejdi and Garcina villages, with a lower WQI of 66.5 as the river is influenced by both natural and anthropic variables. The last one Piatra Neamt - Garcina river sector is intensively affected by human activities (river crosses the city) having a lower quality with an average index of 58. This distribution of WQI along the Cuejdi hydrographic system basin proves that there is a decrease in quality due to the environmental impacts of human activities. The use of this index as a communication tool can be extremely useful for all authorities involved in water management resources.

Massive montmorillonite clays may have developed as vertisols by deep meteoric weathering of underlying basalt flows in a sub-humid to semi-arid climatic setting with pronounced seasonality. Laminated montmorillonite clays, higher in the sequence, accumulated in low-lying areas in inland lakes with poor external drainage. Climatic fluctuations resulted in periods of increased aridity, during which falling lake levels exposed montmorillonite-rich vertisols, lake and playa sediments, to further pedogenesis. Lowering of the water table and increased rates of evaporation allowed leaching of sodium and calcium from the soils; this, in conjunction with the introduction of silica and magnesium by rising ground water, led to the neomorphic development of extensive stratiform palygorskite deposits.

Its deep water is characterised by high concentrations of nutrients, which are slowly released to the surface mixed layer by an upward advective transport. The nutrient inputs (rivers, internal recycling and subaquatic springs) and outputs (out fl ow, sedimentation) are quanti fied to determine each nutrient cycle. Our analyses revealed that N and P cycles are dominated by internal processes, which are internal recycling and burial. P and N external inputs supply only about 15% (P) to 20% (N) of the total inputs to the epilimnion. In contrast, riverine in fl ows and internal recycling contribute equally to Si inputs.

Characterization of Vernal Pools Across National Parks in the Great Lakes Region	WETLANDS												Vernal pools are small, ephemeral wetlands that become inundated each spring and provide many ecosystem services, including providing critical habitat to amphibians and invertebrates as their temporary nature keeps them free of fish. We collected data on vernal pool characteristics throughout five Great Lakes National Parks: Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Isle Royale National Park, and Voyagers National Parks. Our goals were to characterize and assess how vernal pools vary within and across the five national parks, and determine which characteristics are most correlated with the presence of vernal pool indicator species. We sampled 139 pools during spring of 2021 and 2022 where we collected data on pool characteristics related to hydrology, soils, vegetation, geomorphology, and indicator species. We found that vernal pool substrate and forest type does vary between the different parks. Many vernal pool qualities are driven by the type of substrate they occur on and overstory canopy species and amount of tree cover. We also created a classification system that most highly correlated to indicator species presence and can be used in remote sensing products, resulting in a three-class system based on overstory species composition: Deciduous, Coniferous, and Open. Indicator species were more likely to occur in pools with either a deciduous or open canopy than pools with a coniferous canopy. This information can be used to inform land managers within the Great Lakes of vernal pool characteristics they can expect, and which pools are hotspots for indicator species.

Internal Loading of Phosphorus from Sediments of Swarzedzkie Lake (Western Poland)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Sediments, being the most important source of phosphorus (P) in the shallow (max. depth 7.2 m), polymictic Swarzedzkie Lake during the summer, were thoroughly studied in laboratory experiments with intact cores sampled at 7 stations in four seasons of the year. Under anaerobic conditions P release rates peaked in the samples from the deepest part of the lake at 26.86 mgP m(-2)d(-1). However, the highest rates were determined at one of the littoral sites (near the mouth of a polluted stream) at 59.5 mgP m(-2) d(-1). Littoral P release coincided with occasionally low oxygen concentrations (0.2 mgO(2) l(-1)) above the bottom. On the scale of the whole lake, P release from the littoral zone, where both temperature and oxygen concentration were highly variable, had the strongest influence on the trophic state. It accounted for 63% of the annual internal load but only 55% of total lake area.

Water Supply to the Comstock, the Marlette Lake Water System	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2020: NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA WATER HISTORY					20th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 17-21, 2020	Henderson, NV	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers				Since the first mining of silver in the Washoe Mountains of Utah Territory in 1859, water was a precious commodity. Initially it was obtained from natural springs and tunnels dug into the sides of the mountains above Virginia City and Gold Hill. But the mines required huge amounts of water that couldn't be supplied by the springs. In October 1871, civil engineer Hermann Schussler prepared a report for the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company which proposed a 7-mile-long 11.5-inch riveted wrought iron inverted siphon pipeline from high in the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe, across the Washoe Valley, to discharge in a flume that fed a storage reservoir near Virginia City. The dynamic pressure head at the lowest point in the pipeline was approximately 1,900 feet, the highest in the world at that time. The pipe fabrication started in March 1873, and the project was completed in August 1873. A second pipeline was completed in 1875, a 3,994-foot tunnel was added in 1877, and a third pipeline in 1887. Each of the pipelines also included flumes constructed to convey water to the pressure pipelines and from the end of the pressure pipelines to Virginia City. The Marlette Lake Water System was dedicated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.																					978-0-7844-8299-5				2020							121	128																WOS:000623522900012
J	SIMON, M; ROSENSTOCK, B				SIMON, M; ROSENSTOCK, B			CARBON AND NITROGEN-SOURCES OF PLANKTONIC BACTERIA IN LAKE CONSTANCE STUDIED BY THE COMPOSITION AND ISOTOPE-DILUTION OF INTRACELLULAR AMINO-ACIDS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the physiological response of planktonic bacteria to varying C and N sources in mesotrophic Lake Constance (Bodensee) by studying the amino acid composition and the isotope dilution (ID) of [H-3] amino acids in the intracellular pool. Bacteria predominantly utilized amino acids for growth from the phytoplankton spring bloom in May until August. During this period the amino acid composition of the pool was rather similar to the composition of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) in the water. Serine always was the dominant DFAA and also dominated the intracellular pool from May to August. From January until April, however, the intracellular pool was dominated by glutamate, suggesting that during this period the bacterioplankton utilized NH4+ as a major source of N. During the spring bloom and in June, the ID of the most abundant amino acids was 1 (no dilution) to 4. Glutamate, however, exhibited a much higher ID (10-47), suggesting that NH4+ was utilized by the bacterioplankton during these months. In August, however, ID of all amino acids was high and was not reduced by increasing the concentration of DFAA, indicating that the bacteria in this period predominantly utilized dissolved combined amino acids. The ID of leucine when added at saturating concentration (30 nM was 1.5-3. Incorporation rates of [H-3]DFAA as a fraction of bacterial production were consistent with the results of ID measurements.																			0024-3590					NOV	1992	37	7					1496	1511		10.4319/lo.1992.37.7.1496	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.7.1496													WOS:A1992KM34100011

Thermophilic aquatics such as the Bushy pondweed Najas flexilis, charophyte algae and aquatic invertebrates indicate water level fluctuations of several meters, which were likely linked to a warm, dry summer climate. Pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating at Wilcox Lake shows a hemlock decline at 5800 years ago that lasted 1,000 years. Multiple regression analysis indicates that the decline coincides with a drop in mean annual precipitation from 830 to 700 mm. From fossil pollen analysis the impact of these droughts on the upland forest is poorly visible, except for the hemlock decline during the first half of the 6th millennium ago. The two-phased reduction of hemlock from 30% tree cover to less than 5% within centuries is found in large parts of northeastern America. Our results imply drought-weakened hemlock trees and stands, and that drought may have triggered local insect calamities, such as hemlock looper attack. However, this also implies that climatic change and not a pathogen-pest attack was responsible for the synchronous decline of hemlock all over its range in eastern North America. Reconstructing and understanding the hemlock decline is, therefore, of interest to the public and to ecosystem managers when anticipating the effect of pathogen-pest attacks combined with climatic change.

Effect of Composition on the Compressibility and Shear Strength of Dredged Cohesive Sediment	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Progressively, more dredged sediments are being reused for engineering projects. For example, the Marker Wadden is a new wetland constructed in lake Markermeer, the Netherlands, with dredged cohesive sediments originating from the bed of the lake. Such dredged sediments are often dominated by cohesive sediment particles with varying amounts of sand and organic matter. In addition, during and after the construction process, the material consolidates and is often compressed from a very loose state into a significantly denser condition. To assess the mechanical behavior of this material, the compressibility of the Markermeer dredged sediment samples with various sand and organic matter contents was analyzed with incremental loading oedometer tests, whereas the undrained shear strength was studied using the fall cone test. The behavior was theoretically analyzed assuming a fractal structure of the sediment and applying power law constitutive equations for effective stress, hydraulic conductivity, and undrained shear strength. These constitutive equations, usually used at low initial sediment densities, worked well at the relatively high initial densities studied and proved to be a useful tool to identify the transition fines content TFC. The constitutive equations were put in context with indicators traditionally used in soil mechanics. Samples, each with an identical composition of the fines fraction (particles< 63 mu m), but with a sand content varying from 9 to 40%, showed the same compressibility and undrained shear strength behavior when considering the sand a filler material. For a natural sand content of 70%, the behavior was dominated by sand. The organic matter oxidation was observed to drastically decrease the compressibility and the shear strength, and even to decrease the amount of sand needed to exhibit sand-dominated behavior, showing the importance of the reactivity or state of organic matter on the TFC.

The data was collected during the autumnal overturn on the annual basis except in lake with weekly sampling during the ice-free period. In addition to the deposition data information about catchment soil types as well as local meteorological and hydrological conditions were used for the long-term data interpretation. The lakes are situated in a small area in southern Finland, 130 km north from Helsinki, where sulphate deposition declined by > 60% in one decade since the mid-1980s. The results showed that water colour increased in most lakes while pH did not. In lakes dominated by surface runoff there was a distinct upward shift in colour, with an initial increase after the mid-1990s and a second increase in 2004. The first shift appeared when the sulphate deposition reached a level ca. 25% of that in 1988. However, the upward shift in colour also coincided with a change in hydrological conditions after several dry summers. In contrast, the second shift in colour clearly coincided with a switch in hydrology due to the abnormally wet summer of 2004 after severe drought in 2002-2003. Although the hydrological conditions indisputably had a key role in determining the annual variability in colour, a distinct negative relationship between acid deposition and water colour in 90% of the lakes strongly suggested that reduction in sulphate deposition fostered the leaching of coloured organic substances from the catchment soils. Increase in colour, in turn, strongly influenced lake water pH, and the present day higher organic matter concentrations seemingly depress pH values more than in the 1980s, before the reduction in acid deposition.

They are merolimnic insects with larvae and pupae living in aquatic habitats while adults live in terrestrial habitats in close proximity to water. The goals of this study were to determine the phenology patterns of Dixidae and what influences them, to analyse their preference for microhabitats, and to determine the main ecological factors that have an influence on the composition of Dixidae. Adult Dixidae were collected monthly in the period from 2007 to 2008 at 10 sites, from 2009 to 2010 at four sites, and from 2011 to 2014 at three sites in the Plitvice Lakes National Park. Adult specimens were collected using pyramid-type emergence traps. A total of 1271 Dixidae were collected during eight years of study belonging to five species of the genus Dixa. Dixa submaculata was most abundant species at the spring and upper reach of Bijela rijeka Stream and the upper reach of Crna rijeka Stream. Dixa nebulosa was most numerous at the Kozjak-Milanovac tufa barrier site. Dixa puberula was the dominant species at the rest of the sites. Dixa puberula and Dixa submaculata were univoltine, bivoltine or trivoltine, depending on the site, while Dixa nebulosa was only univoltine. The highest diversity was recorded at the tufa barrier Kozjak-Milanovac, and the highest number of species, four species, was found at the upper reach of the Crna rijeka Stream. The greatest number of specimens was recorded at the Labudovac tufa barrier, 128 specimens in 2014. Water temperature is the main ecological factor that influences the phenology of Dixidae at the tufa barriers and lower streams. Discharge affected the abundance of Dixidae. Dixa puberula prefers moss as a substrate and a faster water velocity.					; Stankovic, Igor/JTU-7925-2023; Ivković, Marija/AAB-1756-2020	Stankovic, Igor/0000-0001-7341-144X; Ivkovic, Marija/0000-0003-3188-5676; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2019	76						11	18		10.1016/j.limno.2019.03.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.03.001													WOS:000468883700002

The occurrence of the bacterium in the fish was assessed and related to gross signs of disease and findings at necropsy as a potential health hazard for fish. Isolated bacteria were subjected to morphological, physiological, biochemical and antibiotic susceptibility tests. A total of 26 A. hydrophila isolates were obtained. There was a clear seasonality, as no isolates were recovered in the summer months. Most of the isolates were sensitive to all the antimicrobials used in the study except novobiocin and penicillin G. Affected fish manifested haemorrhages over the skin, in the liver, kidney and swim bladder, spleen infarcts, fatty liver, ascitic fluid and swollen haemopoietic tissues.

COMM SPACE RES, INT ACAD ASTRON, INT ASTRON FEDERAT, NASA, EUROPEAN SPACE AGCY, DEUT AGENTUR RAUMFAHRTANGELEGENHEITEN GMBH, INT SOC STUDY ORIGIN LIFE				The selection of sites on Mars that have a high priority for exobiological research is fundamental for planning future exploration. The most immediate need is to identify targets for high resolution orbital imaging during the Mars Observer and Mars '94/'96 missions that can be used to refine site priorities for surface exploration. We present an objective approach to site selection whereby individual sites are selected and scored, based on the presence of key geological features which indicate high priority environments. Prime sites are those that show evidence for the prolonged activity of liquid water and which have sedimentary deposits that are likely to have accumulated in environments favorable for life. High priority areas include fluvio-lacustrine (stream-fed lake systems), springs, and periglacial environments. Sites where mineralization may have occurred in the presence of organisms (e.g. springs) are given high priority in the search for a fossil record on Mars. A systematic review of Viking data for 83 sites in the Mars Landing Site Catalog/1/ resulted in the selection of 13 as being of exobiological interest. The descriptions of these sites were expanded to address exobiological concerns. An additional five sites were identified for inclusion in the second edition of the MLSC. We plan to broaden our site selection activities to include a systematic global reconnaissance of Mars using Viking data, and will continue to refine site priorities for exobiological research based on data from future missions in order to define strategies for surface exploration.

The precipitation history during the LIA is poorly understood as compared to the temperature history in tropical South China. In this study, a sediment core with a length of 117.5 cm was recovered in the central part of Huguangyan Lake in tropical South China. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), inorganic carbon (IC) and non-residual strontium (Sr) were analyzed at approximately 1 cm intervals to study the regional precipitation changes during the LIA. Generally, Sr-containing minerals are sensitive to chemical weathering which is dominated by the precipitation in tropical South China. Thus the non-residual Sr in Huguangyan sediments can be used as an indicator of precipitation changes, which is also verified by the downcore variations of TOC, TN and IC in Huguangyan Lake. The non-residual Sr correlated positively with TOC and TN but negatively with IC in the sediment profile. TOC, TN, IC and the non-residual Sr jointly demonstrated a wet period from AD 1500 to 1750, which corresponds to the LIA. Coincidently, both the total solar irradiance (TSI) and Northern Hemisphere temperature have the lowest values between AD 1500 and 1750 over the past millennium. Therefore, the wet LIA in tropical South China was most likely caused by the low solar irradiation. During the LIA, the low solar irradiation likely resulted in the decrease of the Northern Hemisphere temperature, which weakened the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and synchronously moved the north edge of the Asian summer monsoon southward, leading to an increase in the precipitation in tropical South China.

In the past 20,000 years, higher precipitation caused desert lakes to form which have since dried out. Higher glacial precipitation has been hypothesized to result from a southward shift of Pacific winter storm tracks. We compared Pacific Ocean data to lake levels from the interior west and found that Great Basin lake high stands are older than coastal wet periods at the same latitude. Westerly storms were not the source of high precipitation. Instead, air masses from the tropical Pacific were transported northward, bringing more precipitation into the Great Basin when coastal California was still dry. The changing climate during the deglaciation altered precipitation source regions and strongly affected the regional water cycle.

Temperature and water depth effects on brGDGT distributions in sub-alpine lakes of mid-latitude North America	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in lake sediments are increasingly being used to reconstruct past temperatures. However, recent studies suggest that brGDGT distributions and concentrations vary with lake size and environmental conditions, such as seasonality and its effects on water column temperature and chemistry. To test their use as a paleothermometer in high-altitude environments of mid-latitude North America, we analyzed brGDGT distributions in lake surface sediments across a range of lake depths and elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. Our results suggest that brGDGT distributions and the MBT05Me index correlate with water column temperatures, which are sensitive to both lake water depth and air temperatures. Based on these relationships, we developed a calibration to mean summer air temperatures using a Bayesian regression model that incorporates the MBT05Me index and lake water depth. We applied our calibration to lake sediments from Lower Paintrock Lake in northern Wyoming to test its use as a paleothermometer. Reconstructed temperature trends are consistent with pollen-inferred temperatures at the same site and with known regional climate history, demonstrating that our calibration can be successfully applied to infer temperatures in high-altitude environments of mid-latitude North America.

J	BOUDREAU, LD; ROUSE, WR				BOUDREAU, LD; ROUSE, WR			THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL TERRAIN UNITS IN THE WATER-BALANCE OF WETLAND TUNDRA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The water balance of a High Subarctic wetland was measured in a newly established research basin near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Measurements spanned the growing season from early June through to the end of August 1991. The watershed was instrumented such that the water budget could be monitored over each of the dominant terrain units. The study basin has 5 major terrain types consisting of sedge-dominated wetland, upland lichen-heath, tundra lakes and ponds, willow-birch wetland, and open spruce forest, in decreasing order of coverage. These terrain units, and the ecosystem as a whole, are representative of coastal wetlands underlain by permafrost in the Hudson Bay Lowland. Runoff and thus streamflow were closely tied to the moisture status of the peatlands and to the depth of the active layer. During 2 unusually dry periods, the peatlands remained wet, which indicates a lack of water mobility when the water table drops below the surface of the wetland. Streamflow response to rainfall during these periods was small in comparison to early summer when the frost table was near the surface, or to wet periods when the water table rose above the surface. Energy balance measurements showed the lakes and ponds to have about 15% higher net radiation than wetlands and 29% greater than upland lichen-heath. From 9 to 18% of net radiation was used in thawing and heating the ground whereas the latent heat flux for the various terrain types utilized from 49 to 83% of net radiation. Even with unusually large rainfalls that occurred in July, evaporation exceeded precipitation over the course of the summer. Despite this, runoff was high and required a large negative change in groundwater storage to account for it. The Lichen-heath and ponds exhibited the greatest change in water storage. The drainage of water from the uplands to the lowlands maintained the soil moisture of the peatlands and contributed to streamflow. Each terrain type had a characteristic water balance due to differences in one or more of the hydrologic variables (evapotranspiration, runoff and storage). This has important implications concerning the impact on the water balance of a change in surface cover brought about by a change in climate.																			0936-577X					FEB 23	1995	5	1					31	47		10.3354/cr005031	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr005031													WOS:A1995RQ20800005

Vertical Axis Rotation Across the Eastern Mono Basin and West-Central Walker Lane Revealed by Paleomagnetic Data From the Jack Springs Tuff	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The mid-Miocene Jack Springs Tuff (JST) outcrops from the Bodie Hills of eastern California into the western Mina Deflection, Nevada. Distal outcrops of the JST occur northwest of Mono Lake, CA, on a minimally rotated structural block. This provides a reference location for our paleomagnetic study to estimate relative vertical-axis rotation. A new 40Ar/39Ar age places the eruption of the JST at 12.114 +/- 0.006 Ma. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility data, once corrected for local tilt and vertical axis rotation, yields a mean imbrication that trends 178 degrees. The probable source of the JST is located in the Huntoon Valley/Queens Valley region. Eighteen paleomagnetic sites constrain mid-Miocene to recent vertical axis rotation within the region. All sites are discordant to the reference location with variable amounts of clockwise vertical axis rotation ranging from 25 degrees to 104 degrees. We hypothesize that a previously unrecognized early phase of deformation occurred that predates the deformation in the central Mina Deflection. These new data support the hypothesis that transtensional faulting associated with North American and Pacific plate interaction transferred deformation across the Mono Basin region that was partially accommodated by vertical axis rotation. By late Miocene, deformation had stepped east developing the Silver Peak-Lone Mountain detachment system followed by the structures that presently define the central Mina deflection. This study further demonstrates that deformation occurred east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the latitude of the Mono Basin in western-most Nevada, a region previously thought to be undeformed in terms of clockwise vertical axis rotation.

Sediment-bound Arsenic and Uranium Within the Bowman-Haley Reservoir, North Dakota	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The purpose of this study was to determine the impacts of regional historical uranium mining activities within sediments of the Bowman-Haley reservoir of southwestern North Dakota. The extent of anthropogenic-influenced watershed impacts were quantified through the determination of sediment metals concentrations and metal enrichment factors to evaluate the potential of geochemically influenced As and U remobilization within the reservoir sediments. Sediment cores were collected and analyzed for total metal concentrations at five locations within the reservoir: Spring Creek delta, Alkali Creek delta, two locations within the North Fork of the Grand River confluence, and adjacent to the reservoir outfall. Pearson-moment correlations were used to establish inter-core metal correlations, while sediment enrichment factors were determined relative to background concentrations. Enrichment factor results suggest all sampling sites are classified as minor to moderately enriched for As and U. Metal behavior for the three reservoir inlets indicated similar metal loading sources and post-depositional behavior, while metals migration within the vicinity of the reservoir outlet appear to be controlled by geochemical and/or physical processes. For the reservoir outlet, As and U normalized to Al suggest the occurrence of vertical migration of As, while surface-bound U remobilization was apparent within the water column immediately above the sediments. Elevated U was found within the Spring Creek inlet, and appear attributed to historical uranium processing operations located in Griffin, North Dakota. While the reservoir As and U sediment concentrations may be considered low, their presence appears directly attributed to historical uranium mining activities within the Bowman-Haley reservoir watershed.

Although, there is a poorly known historical and post-glacial register of mass wasting phenomena and a complete absence of monitoring for potential future processes. In particular, the area called Los lagos, in Argentina, which is located south of latitude 35* S, where the glacial erosion shaped several valleys on both sides of the Andean range. The Andean area between 35* and 42* S has been releasing almost 25% of the world's total seismic energy from the adjacent subduction zone. The objective of this work is to analyze, a sector, in the northern margin of the Traful Lake, called Bosque Sumergido. The name of Bosque Sumergido was given because of the presence of an area of submerged dead trees in life position where part of the wood can be found underwater. In this work, we evaluate the potential risk for the city of Traful, located in front of it. We described this area in the context of mass wasting processes, the coastal morphological changes that occurred in the last 22 years and even some underwater features and bathymetry and analyzed the potential risk of tsunamis due to material falling into Traful Lake.						folguera, andres/0000-0001-8965-8543													0895-9811					MAR	2020	98								102361	10.1016/j.jsames.2019.102361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2019.102361													WOS:000517664800023

In this study we investigate how the Caspian Sea level changes affect the coastal Ramsar sites. Particularly, we focus on the Gorgan Bay in the southeast corner of the Caspian Sea, which is experiencing extensive water level decline, even desiccation. We used satellite images from three periods corresponding to periods of two sea level falls and one sea level rise, in order to decipher spatio-temporal changes of the wetlands. We conducted field campaign in the Gorgan Bay for sampling and measurement of physical, chemical and biological parameters. We simulated water circulation for the past, current and future conditions of the Gorgan Bay, which is essential to sustain better water exchange between the Bay and the Caspian Sea. We applied dust simu-lation in the case of a total desiccation of the Gorgan Bay. The result shows that the total area of the Caspian coastal Ramsar sites during the two periods of the sea level fall is almost the same; however, the aerial changes in the southern wetlands are more visible. Nutrient and plankton analysis of the Gorgan Bay display mainly mesotrophic conditions, in some areas close to eutrophic ones. The average current velocity in the main inlet is 2.5 cms-1. Dust simulation indi-cates that in case of the Gorgan Bay desiccation, it will become a dust source for the surrounding area up to 60 km. Simulation of the water circulation with dredging of inlets (future scenario), indicates that the water exchange velocity doubles compared to the current scenario. A recommended inlet maintenance would accelerate water circulation and reduce residence time, which will lead to better trophy and prevent bay desiccation.					; Azizpour, Jafar/AAA-8603-2022; Alizadeh Ketek Lahijani, Hamid/JDW-7703-2023; Hamzeh, Mohammad Ali/L-5145-2017; ghafarian, parvin/AAT-9828-2021	Mohammadpour Penchah, Mohammadreza/0000-0001-8414-6426; Mahmoudof, Seyed Masoud/0000-0002-8984-9267; Alizadeh Ketek Lahijani, Hamid/0000-0001-6136-3655													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		1						158833	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158833		OCT 2022						36122717					WOS:000899267000015

Removal was implemented and coordinated by the regional environmental Council, National security forces and public companies. Immediately after its detection, the distribution and abundance of water hyacinth, and the possible origin of introduction were assessed as the basis for selecting a feasible removal method. Plants were scattered across 110 ha and a perimeter of 8.4 km. A total biomass of 1,931 kg (fresh weight) was removed between May and December 2021 by combining manual removal from water using inflatable boats, floating booms, wetsuits and fishing waders, as well as removal from the shore. In total, the action cost ca. (sic)22,500. Most biomass (83%) was removed during the initial control phase (one month). However, most of the efforts and costs (83%) were made in the following seven months, especially for monitoring and follow-up treatments. Rapid response avoided the growth, blooming and spread that could be expected in summer, coinciding with the optimal growing conditions. Moreover, rapid response reduced ca. 50 times the biomass and control costs with respect to a delayed action (i.e., after summer). Despite the fact that monitoring required a higher effort and cost than the initial control phase, it altogether represented a great cost saving as the invasion was kept at bay. The coordination between the regional Council, National security forces and public companies has taken advantage of the specific strengths of each one of them, achieving the shortest possible response time.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data have proven to be especially useful for measurement of climatologically significant parameters characteristic of frozen lakes. In this paper, five lakes in Glacier National Park, Montana, have been studied both in the field and using ERS 1 SAR data during the 1992-1993 winter. The lakes are characterized by clear ice, sometimes with tubular or rounded bubbles, and often with a layer of snow ice on top of the clear ice. They are also often snow covered. Freeze-up is detected quite easily using ERS 1 SAR data as soon as a thin layer of ice forms. The effect of snow ice on the backscatter is thought to be significant but is, as yet, undetermined. On the five lakes studied, relative backscatter was found to increase with ice thickness until a maximum was reached in February. Breakup, an often ill-defined occurrence, is difficult to detect because surface water causes the SAR signal to be absorbed, thus masking the ice below. Comparison of the bubble structure of thaw lakes in northern Alaska with lakes in northern Montana has shown that the ice structure is quite different, and this difference may contribute to differential SAR signature evolution in the lakes of the two areas.					; Hall, Dorothy/D-5562-2012	Klasner, Frederick/0000-0002-7615-495X; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				NOV 15	1994	99	C11					22473	22482		10.1029/94JC01391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC01391													WOS:A1994PR66800008

Its less wide-spread relative.. Cylindrospermopsis cuspis KOMAREK & KLING (1991), first described from Lake Victoria, was then reported to occur in small volcanic lakes in the Los Tuxtlas region, Mexico (KOMAREK & KOMARKOVA-LEG-NEROVA 2002), and in Lake Okeechobee, Florida (PHLIPS et al. 1997). Akinetes were not observed by Komarek and Kling and were never described for this species. In 1998, C. cuspis invaded Lake Kinneret, Israel, 4 years after the invasion and major bloom of Aphanizomenon ovali-sporum, the first-ever reported bloom of N(2)-fixing cyanobacteria (POLLINGHER et al. 1998) in this mesoeutrophic, subtropical, warm monomictic lake (SERRUYA 1978). Since its 1998 appearance, C. cuspis has been found in the water column nearly every summer, initially at low concentrations, but since 2003 it has formed major summer blooms, exceeding by far the abundance of A. ovalisporum (Fig. 1). Until 2000, the rare C. cuspis trichomes had no heterocytes and were recorded as Raphidiopsis mediterranea. The first heterocyte-bearing filaments were observed in 2001, when filament abundance first exceeded 500/mL, and they were identified by J. Komarek as C cuspis. We report here oil the spatial and temporal dynamics of C cuspis in Lake Kinneret, examine these dynamics in relation to environmental parameters, and assess features that may have enabled it to out-compete A. ovalisporum.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54079-2				2009	30		8				1251	1254																WOS:000274244900021

Establishing a long-term framework is important to examine the context of historic events and help predict potential future changes critical for effective water resource management. Ridges in the embayment formed between about 4,200 and 2,100 calendar years before 1950 (cal. yrs. B. P.) and were created and preserved every 28 +/- 4.8 years on average. Groups of three to six beach ridges coupled with inflections in the lake-level curve indicate a history of lake levels fluctuations and outlet changes. A rapid lake-level drop (approximately 4 m) from about 4, 100 to 3,800 cal. yrs. B.P. was associated with a fall from the Nipissing II high-water- level phase. A change from a gradual fall to a slight rise was associated with an outlet change from Port Huron, Michigan/Sarnia, Ontario to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan/Ontario. A complete outlet change occurred after the Algoma high-water- level phase (ca. 2,400 cal. yrs. B.P.). Preliminary rates of vertical ground movement calculated from the strandplain are much greater than rates calculated from historical and geologic data. High rates of vertical ground movement could have caused tectonism in the Whitefish Bay area, modifying the strandplain during the past 2,400 years. A tectonic event at or near the Sault outlet also may have been a factor in the outlet change from Port Huron/Sarnia to Sault Ste. Marie.

Sampling of periphytic diatoms, phytoplankton, and water were carried out at ten different littoral sites in the northern and southern shores of the lake for a year. Phytoplankton species were sorted into functional groups and ecological status was assessed by means of the phytoplankton assemblage Q index. The index TDIL was calculated using quantitative attached diatom data. Significant differences were found between the ecological assessments based on phytoplankton and phytobenthos metrics, both seasonally and spatially. The Q index indicated ecological states varying from bad to good, while the average of diatom indices varied from moderate to high conditions. The Q index provided more realistic ecological status of Lake Balaton, compared with trophic status based on TP values, especially in the summer period. Differences in the response-time indication of phytoplankton and attached diatoms suggest that lack of coherence should also be expected between the responses of other BQEs.

Sessile-like bacteria and planktonic (suspended) counterparts were exposed for 28 d to natural (spring)-water at two temperatures (4 degrees C and 18 degrees C). Culturabilities on non-selective and selective solid media were monitored over the exposure period, together with cell viability that was determined by using a fluorescent viability probe and confocal scanning laser microscopy analysis. The number of planktonic organisms recovered on non-selective medium decreased by 3 logarithmic units during exposure at 4 degrees C and was reduced to an undetectable level at 18 degrees C. Whatever the temperature of the spring water microcosm, however, the immobilized-cell population did not decrease by more than one log unit over the exposure period. Cell counts on coliform-selective, lactose-deoxycholate agar plates confirmed the enhanced resistance of gel-entrapped cells to environment stress as compared to planktonic organisms: at the two tested temperatures, sublethal injury of suspended E. coli reached more than 80% whereas it did not exceed 65% for immobilized cells. Viability studies indicated that planktonic cells rapidly died. These results show that the ability of microorganisms to colonize aquatic ecosystems in the fixed state (i.e. as biofilms) must be considered in studies evaluating cell survival in these environments.

Phytoplankton co-limitation by nitrogen and phosphorus in a shallow reservoir: progressing from the phosphorus limitation paradigm	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phosphorus (P) limitation has been regarded as the rule in freshwater systems and the basis for phytoplankton growth management. We hypothesised that P would be the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in Grahamstown Dam, a shallow, mesotrophic reservoir, across different seasons and on different experimental time scales. Seven fully factorial microcosm assays with additions of nitrogen (N) and P were conducted in situ during different seasons. The influence of longer experimental duration was examined in two 18-day mesocosm assays. Additions of N and P in combination evoked significantly higher phytoplankton biomass and biovolumes of individual algal genera compared with controls and other treatments in both types of experiment. There were some significant responses to P additions in the microcosm assays in winter. Some genera first responded to combined P and N addition and then to P only addition during the mesocoms assays. Our results show that P was not the limiting nutrient across all seasons but that phytoplankton was mostly co-limited by N and P. A longer experimental time scale did not change this outcome at the biomass level. This implies that input of N as well as of P should be considered in the management of phytoplankton growth.

To comprehensively understand hydroclimate change and reconstruct hydroclimatic anomalies such as drought periods, appropriate proxy records reaching further back in time beyond meteorological measurements are needed. Here we present a 220-year (2015-1790 CE), continuous, stable oxygen isotope record of diatoms ( delta 18 O diatom ) from Lake Khamra (59.99 degrees N, 112.98 degrees E) in eastern Siberia, an area highly sensitive to climate change and for which there is a demand for palaeohydrological data. This high-resolution proxy record was obtained from a 210 Pb- 137 Cs-dated sediment short core and analysed to reconstruct hydroclimate variability at a sub-decadal scale. The interpretation of the delta 18 O diatom record is supported by meteorological data, modern isotope hydrology and geochemical analyses of the same sediment, which is indicative of the conditions in the lake and catchment. A comparison with meteorological data going back to 1930 CE revealed that the delta 18 O diatom record of Lake Khamra is primarily influenced by regional precipitation changes rather than the air temperature. We identified winter precipitation, which enters the lake as isotopically depleted snowmelt water, as the key process impacting the diatom isotope variability. We related the overall depletion of delta 18 O diatom in recent decades to an observed increase in winter precipitation in the area, likely associated with the global air temperature rise, Arctic sea ice retreat and increased moisture transport inland. Available palaeoclimate proxy records, including a fire reconstruction for the same lake, support the idea that the new record is a valuable hydroclimate proxy that is indicative of precipitation deficits and excludes solar insolation and air temperature as primary driving forces, even before the first meteorological recordings. We propose two possible hydroclimatic anomalies that were detected in the Lake Khamra delta 18 O diatom record: one at the beginning of the 19th century and a second prominent event in the 1950s. Both are interpreted as prolonged dry periods associated with enriched delta 18 O diatom values likely caused by reduced winter precipitation, which coincide with phases of reconstructed severe wildfires in the region. Despite the apparent pristine lake area, we observed a three- to fourfold increase in mercury concentrations and accumulation rates within the sediment record since the early 20th century, which is partly attributed to human air pollution.

Data from 1996, indicative of the most recent productivity of the lake, with those from 1973, when the lake was meso-eutrophic, allow a discussion of the relevance of the observed changes for the structure of the pelagic food web of Lago Maggiore. Daphnia summer dynamics is mainly controlled by Bythotrephes longimanus. This is quite a different situation from that of the past, when Leptodora kindtii was the prevalent predatory cladocera. The size structure of Daphnia population revealed a depletion of small ovigerous females with increases in the predator.

We analyzed dissolved uranium concentrations in lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in Ohio, USA during the summer of 2017.

Uranium concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 3.9 mu g L-1, with the lowest concentrations observed in the most offshore Lake Erie samples. These results, especially when placed in the context of previous work on both surface and groundwater, suggest that dissolved uranium concentrations in this water emanating from agricultural lands are higher than background, and uranium should be categorized similarly to nitrate and phosphate in that it originates in part from fertilizer application.

Fish and fish-eating birds at the Salton Sea: a century of boom and bust	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We reconstruct historical trends in both fish and fish-eating bird populations at the Salton Sea, California since the Sea's formation in 1905. The fish community has undergone dramatic shifts in composition, from freshwater species present in the initial wash-in to stocked marine species to dominance by an unintentionally introduced cichlid. Historical catch records, creel censuses, and gill-netting studies suggest that total fish biomass in the lake increased dramatically throughout the 1970s, crashed in the late 1980s, recovered in the mid-1990s, and crashed again in the early 2000s. We speculate that crashes in fish populations are primarily due to three physiological stressors-rising salinity, cold winter temperatures, and high sulfide levels and anoxia associated with mixing events. The trends in fish biomass are mirrored in population trends of both breeding and wintering fish-eating birds, as indexed by a number of independent bird surveys. In contrast, most non-piscivorous birds at the Salton Sea show no indication of these temporal dynamics. We discuss possible explanations for the observed trends in fish-eating bird populations, including decline in organochlorine insecticide use and fluctuations in prey abundance at the Salton Sea. Finally, we speculate on the future prospects of both fish and fish-eating birds at the Salton Sea given the environmental challenges the Sea currently faces.

J	ASHWORTH, AC				ASHWORTH, AC			THE STRATIGRAPHIC RECORD FOR CLIMATE-CHANGE AT THE END OF THE PLEISTOCENE IN SOUTHERN SOUTH-AMERICA	ANTHROPOLOGIE												In the mid-latitudes of South America, glaciers reached their maximum extent at 19 000 year BP By 13 000 yr BP glaciers were in rapid retreat from Tierra del Fuego to the Chilean Lake Region. The retreat may have been initiated synchronously before 14 000 yr BP by sea level rise. Deglaciation along the Pacific coast proceeded more rapidly than along the eastern flank of the Andes. In the mid-latitudes, the glacial vegetation, a wet moorland, was replaced by rain forest between about 14 000 yr BP and 12 500 yr BP. The massive biotic response was caused by a rapid rise in mean summer temperature of about 4-5-degrees-C. In the high-latitudes, the climatic response was different. Mean summer temperatures and precipitation levels in Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia, and the South Atlantic were low until the early Holocene. The muted response in the southernmost regions was possibly caused by the lengthy deglaciation of Antarctica. Evidence for the existence of a return to cold climatic conditions between 11 000 to 10 000 yr BP is conflicting. Presently, the weight of evidence is against there having been any significant climatic change at the time of the Younger Dryas.																			0003-5521	1873-5827					1994	98	1					3	24																WOS:A1994QE96300001

A greater utilisation of allochthonous DOC was observed under estuarine as compared to Limnic conditions. However, the bacterial biomass yield was not significantly different between the environments, indicating a lower growth efficiency on allochthonous DOC by the estuarine bacterioplankton. The largest fraction of the allochthonous DOC utilised (20 %) was observed under estuarine conditions and coincided with the spring flood. The utilisation of allochthonous DOC and bacterial biomass yield in the experimental bottles was Limited by the availability of nitrogen or phosphorus in both environments. Our results showed that the major bacterial transformation of DOC occurred in the estuarine rather than the Limnic environment, due to the shift in physicochemical milieu and bacterial assemblage. However, the estuarine bacteria also respired a greater fraction of the DOC utilised than their limnic counterparts.

Based on both field data and laboratory studies, the summer population of Daphnia longispina living in a stratified eutrophic lake was examined in relation to the abundance of algae, nanoflagellates and picocyanobacteria. 2. In early July, the Daphnia population replaced Bosmina and remained the dominant zooplankter during summer 1994. Its development in July was concomitant with an increase of edible algae but, despite the apparent abundance in available food, the Daphnia population decreased throughout August suggesting poor food conditions. 3. From mid-August to the beginning of September, the biomass of inedible phytoplankton was greater than that of the smaller, edible fraction. Consequently the average rate of increase, birth rates and fecundity of Daphnia remained low. Although the biomass of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was consistently low the demographic parameters of Daphnia were correlated throughout this period with these protozoans. 4. Life table experiments run in the laboratory showed that epilimnetic food supported both the growth in length of individual Daphnia and an increase in fecundity, but metalimnetic food supported only individual growth. D. longispina probably failed to reproduce because of the abundance of detritus mixed with the heterotrophic nanoflagellates in the metalimnetic water at that period of the year. The vertical migration of Daphnia into these deeper layers could be caused by a predator avoidance mechanism.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1997	38	3					739	752		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00255.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00255.x													WOS:000071561200026
J	Erismis, UC				Erismis, Ugur Cengiz			Age, Size, and Growth of the Turkish Endemic Frog Pelophylax Caralitanus (Anura: Ranidae)	ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Pelophylax caralitanus is a medium-sized frog that is endemic to the upland Lake District of south-central Turkey and currently identified as a threatened species as a result of overharvesting and habitat modification. In this report, demographic data are provided for four major lakeside populations of this species based on a skeletochronological analysis of bone growth in large samples of frogs that were captured and released during 2011 and 2013. Adult males (aged 2-9 years) and females (aged 210 years) ranged in size from 66 to 105 mm snout-vent length (SVL) and 65 to 110 mm SVL, respectively, and typically attained sexual maturity in their second (low-elevation sites) or third (high-elevation sites) summer of growth following metamorphosis. The four populations exhibited differences in growth rate and age at sexual maturity, which appeared to reflect differences in the average monthly temperature and length of the growth season rather than elevation per se, that is, warmer temperatures and longer growth seasons resulted in smaller adults. All populations had a similar overall age structure, with approximately equal frequencies of individuals in the five age and size classes following maturity.

A Spatially Explicit Model to Predict Walleye Spawning in an Eastern Lake Ontario Tributary	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Field egg collections coupled with physical habitat measurements were used to develop, apply, and validate a spatially explicit model to predict the spawning sites of walleyes Sander vitreus in an eastern Lake Ontario tributary. We collected 22,246 walleye eggs using passive traps and measured the attendant habitat variables, including substrate composition and heterogeneity, water depth and velocity, and cumulative spring water temperature. The squared term that we used for water depth in our regressions and selected over linear and polynomial fits better represented the relationship between spawning probability and depth. To predict walleye spawning likelihood, we developed 10 candidate models based on the available spawning data; following an information-theoretic approach, we compared the models by means of Akaike's information criterion. The best model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.89 and a weight of evidence of 0.32, where the probability of spawning (egg presence) was associated with predominance of course substrate and shallow depth and timing was associated with the accumulated spring water temperature. The model was applied to the study stream and validated by additional egg collections. The model correctly classified egg presence/absence in 66.7% (10 of 15) of egg traps in the initial validation sample. After a high-flow event, classification success decreased to only 20% (3 of 15 traps), probably because of the redistribution of eggs to less suitable habitats in depositional areas. Prediction of walleye spawning distribution allows for reach-scale assessment of critical habitat to help guide spawning habitat restoration efforts.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2009	29	6					1686	1697		10.1577/M08-222.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-222.1													WOS:000277113800016

Three aspects of winter ice in Lake Michigan were studied over a 3-year period and found to have an important influence on coastal sediment dynamics and the coastal sediment budget: (1) the influence of coastal ice on shoreface morphology, (2) the transport of littoral sediments by ice, and (3) the formation of anchor and underwater ice as a frequent and important event entraining and transporting sediment. Coastal lake ice includes a belt of mobile brash (ice blocks) and slush and a dynamic nearshore ice complex consisting of an icefoot, a lakeward sequence of wave-generated ice ridges, and intervening ice lagoons. Our studies indicate that the nearshore ice complex contains a sediment load (0.2 - 1.2 t/m of coast) that is roughly equivalent to the average amount of sand eroded from the coastal bluffs and to the amount sand ice-rafted offshore to the deep lake basin each year. Up to 0.28 t/m of coast can be entrained by ice in a single anchor-ice event, and separate events occurred on 15 days in January 1991. The brash/slush belt is the most important system component responsible for ice-induced sediment transport. Estimates of longshore ice drift, ice volume, and ice-borne sediment load suggest that 0.36 to 4.14 x 10(3) t/d are transported alongshore.																			0380-1330						1994	20	1					179	195		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71139-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71139-4													WOS:A1994NL34800014

We test the methods using a new, 113-sample calibration set from Estonia, Lithuania and European Russia, and a Holocene fossil pollen sequence from Lake Kharinei, a previously studied lake in northeast European Russia. We find WA-PLS to outperform WA, probably because of smaller edge-effect biases in the ends of the calibration set gradient. The Bayesian-based calibration models show further improved performance compared with WA-PLS in leave-one-out cross-validation, while additional h-block cross-validation shows the Bayesian method to be little affected by spatial autocorrelation. Comparison with independent climate proxies reveals, however, some clear biases in the Bayesian palaeotemperature reconstructions, likely reflecting in part some specific limitations of our calibration set. As the selected prior parameters can significantly affect both Bayesian cross-validation performance and reconstructions, there is a clear need to further test the Bayesian method in different geographic contexts and over different timescales, with special attention given to the selection of the most realistic priors in each situation. In general, our finding that statistically well-performing transfer functions may produce clearly differing palaeotemperature reconstructions urges caution in transfer function-based inferences. We additionally test a spatially restricted, 58-sample subset of the full 113-sample calibration set. We find some reduced biases with the smaller set, likely because of complex, partially bimodal responses of several taxa along the longer temperature gradient, ill-suited for calibration methods assuming unimodal responses to climate.

J	Wang, XC; Feng, L				Wang, Xinchi; Feng, Lian			Patterns and Trends in Northern Hemisphere River Ice Phenology from 2000 to 2021	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												River ice plays a crucial role in hydrology, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems in mid-to-high latitude regions. However, there is a notable gap in the analysis of patterns and trends in river ice phenologies and their influence factors at the river level. In this study, we developed a practical method to identify river ice phenologies by leveraging Landsat observations from 2000 to 2021, and established a comprehensive dataset encompassing 7970 river segments across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Our results revealed that the mean freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice duration for these river segments were October 24, May 4, and 192.1 days, respectively. Notably, 56% of the river segments exhibited a warming trend, with the average freeze-up date delayed by 2.7 days per decade, break-up date advanced by 2.5 days per decade, and ice duration shortened by 5.5 days per decade-nearly five times the documented decrease rate over the past 150 years. Furthermore, high- latitude polar regions and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau demonstrated the most pronounced decreases in ice duration, exceeding 7.0 days per decade on average. We observed a substantial relative contribution, reaching up to 70%, of surface air temperature (SAT) in middle and low latitude regions characterized by relatively high winter temperatures. However, as winter temperatures decrease, the relative influence of SAT diminishes, while the contributions of precipitation, solar radiation, and residuals increase. Our dataset provided essential baseline for further understanding the fundamental physical processes within river systems, offering crucial insights for river management, hydrological disaster risk control, climate change research, and ecosystem conservation efforts.					wang, xinchi/JVO-8292-2024														0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV 1	2024	313								114346	10.1016/j.rse.2024.114346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114346		AUG 2024											WOS:001295124200001
J	Booth, DB; Kraseski, KA; Jackson, CR				Booth, Derek B.; Kraseski, Kristin A.; Jackson, C. Rhett			Local-scale and watershed-scale determinants of summertime urban stream temperatures	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The influence of urbanization on the temperature of small streams is widely recognized, but these effects are confounded by the great natural variety of their contributing watersheds. To evaluate the relative importance of local-scale and watershed-scale factors on summer temperatures in urban streams, hundreds of near-instantaneous temperature measurements throughout the central Puget Lowland, western Washington State, were collected during a single 2-h period in August in each of the years 1998-2001. Stream temperatures ranged from 8.9 to 27.5 degrees C, averaging 15.4 degrees C. Pairwise correlation coefficients between stream temperature and four watershed variables (total watershed area and the watershed percentages of urban development, upstream lakes, and permeable glacial outwash soils as an indicator of groundwater exchange) were uniformly very low. Akaike's information criterion was applied to determine the best-supported sets of watershed-scale predictor variables for explaining the variability of stream temperatures. For the full four-year dataset, the only well-supported model was the global model (using all watershed variables); for the most voluminous single-year (1999) data, Akaike's information criterion showed greatest support for per cent outwash (Akaike weight of 0.44), followed closely by per cent urban development + per cent outwash, per cent lake area only, and the global model. Upstream lakes resulted in downstream warming of up to 3 degrees C; variability in riparian shading imposed a similar temperature range. Watershed urbanization itself is not the most important determining factor for summer temperatures in this region; even the long-recognized effects of riparian shading can be no more influential than those imposed by other local-scale and watershed-scale factors.

Winter flounder Pleuronectes americanus were reared from hatching through the larval period and up to 2 mo into the juvenile period. Successive cohorts of fish which metamorphosed on the same day were pooled and measured at weekly intervals during the early juvenile period. Growth rates of larvae and juveniles were inversely related. This resulted in compensation in size-at-age by juveniles that grew relatively slowly as larvae. Although the complete analysis of juvenile growth rates was confined to Weeks 1 to 4 following metamorphosis, an analysis of early metamorphosed cohorts for which 3 additional weeks of measurements were available revealed that juvenile growth rates exhibited during Weeks 1 to 4 were maintained during Weeks 5 to 7. Among these early metamorphosed cohorts there was evidence that size-at-age converged during Weeks 1 to 7 of the juvenile period. Our results suggest that size advantages gained during the larval period can be lost in the early juvenile period. This is important because size- and growth-dependent processes are known to directly affect survival and reproduction. If growth compensation is general, future studies which examine the consequences of size-dependent phenomena during the larval and juvenile periods of fishes will need to integrate the dynamics of growth in both periods rather than considering them in isolation.

J	Jayko, AS				Jayko, AS			Late Quaternary denudation, Death and Panamint Valleys, eastern California	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Late Quaternary denudation rates are constrained from alluvial falls and tributary watersheds in central Death and Panamint Valleys. preliminary results suggest that the denudation rate is in part a function of the mean watershed elevation. Rainfall increases semi-logarithmically with higher elevation to about 2500 m where it becomes limited by the regional average maximum moisture content of the air mass. The fail volumes show a power-law relation to the watershed areas. The fail volumes ranged from about 250,000 to 4000 km(3) and the watershed areas range from about 60,000 to 2000 km(2). The upper limit of the denudation rates estimated from small Death Valley falls restricted to the east side of the basin along the Black Mountain frontal scarp range between about 0.03 to 0.18 mm/yr. The maximum is made by assuming most of the elastic accumulation in these fans followed the last highstand of Lake Manly around 24,000 yr which is the least conservative condition. The upper limit of the denudation rates from the Panamint fans range from 0.04 to 0.20 mm/yr assuming the accumulation mainly postdates OIS-4 similar to 60,000 yr or OIS-2 similar to 20,000 yr based oil the presence or absence of inset shorelines from the last glacial-pluvial maximum. The greater denudation rate associated with the higher mean watershed elevations can mainly be attributed to the greater rainfall at higher elevation. Denudation rates are about a third or less of the Neogene dip-slip rates reported from nearby active faults consistent with relief increasing during dryer periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Stable isotopes (D and O-18) and hydrochemistry are employed to investigate the source of lake water to better understand its recharge dynamics. Results show that, in additional to local rainfall, groundwater is also an important water supply to the lake and accounts for a greater proportion. The groundwater is not recharged by local rainfall, but originates from other sources with significantly depleted isotope values. Combined with springs and artesian wells in the basin, it is consistent with the recent discover of external groundwater recharging in Northern China.

The massive usage of artificial snow, human occupation, and the release of xenobiotics like microplastics or ski wax components on ski tracks can profoundly alter snow microbial ecology. Here, we reconstructed the temporal dynamics of the snow microbiome at three sites in the Italian Alps: inside and outside a ski track at the impacted site of Santa Caterina Valfurva and near Cancano lake as an unimpacted control. Using epifluorescence microscopy, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and inferred metagenomics, we found that the snow microbiome inside the track presented a higher load of prokaryotes and viruses. Notably, N2-fixing microorganisms from cryospheric environments and host-associated taxa, like Terrisporobacter, Clostridium sensu stricto, Enterococcus, and Muribaculaceae, and the opportunistic pathogen Citrobacter characterised the impacted site. These microorganisms could originate from the river water used to produce artificial snow during winter. Our findings highlight the complexity and multifunctionality of the snow microbiome, where microorganisms with different ecological propensities can coexist, and the detectable impact of ski tourism, which enriches host-associated and xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms. This underscores the need for systematic monitoring and protection of the snow microbiome in the Alpine environment from anthropogenic threats.

Catchment-scale carbon fluxes and processes in major rivers of northern Qu?bec, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Boreal rivers transport and process large amounts of organic and inorganic materials derived from their catchments, yet quantitative estimates and patterns of carbon (C) transport and emissions in these large rivers are scarce relative to those of high-latitude lakes and headwater streams. Here, we present the results of a large-scale survey of 23 major rivers in northern Quebec sampled during the summer period of 2010, which aimed to determine the magnitude and spatial variability of different C species (carbon dioxide -CO2, methane -CH4, total carbon - TC, dissolved organic carbon -DOC and inorganic carbon -DIC), as well as to identify their main drivers. In addition, we constructed a first order mass balance of total riverine C emissions to the atmosphere (outgassing from the main river channel) and export to the ocean over summer. All rivers were supersaturated in pCO2 and pCH4 (partial pressure of CO2 and CH4), and the resulting fluxes varied widely among rivers, especially the CH4. There was a positive relationship between DOC and gas concentrations, suggesting a common watershed source of these C species. DOC concentrations declined as a func-tion of % land surface covered by water (lentic + lotic systems) in the watershed, suggesting that lentic systems may act as a net sink of organic matter in the landscape. The C balance suggests that the export component is higher than atmospheric C emissions in the river channel. However, for heavily dammed rivers, C emissions to the atmosphere ap-proaches the C export component. Such studies are highly important for the overall efforts to effectively quantify and incorporate major boreal rivers into whole-landscape C budgets, to determine the net role of these ecosystems as C sinks or sources, and to predict how these might shift under anthropogenic pressures and dynamic climate conditions.

Based on satellite images and extensive field investigations, we demonstrate that a coherent lake growth on the TP interior (TPI) has occurred since the late 1990s in response to a significant global climate change. Closed lakes on the TPI varied heterogeneously during 1976-1999, but expanded coherently and significantly in both lake area and water depth during 1999-2010. Although the decreased potential evaporation and glacier mass loss may contribute to the lake growth since the late 1990s, the significant water surplus is mainly attributed to increased regional precipitation, which, in turn, may be related to changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation, including the intensified Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon (NHSM) circulation and the poleward shift of the Eastern Asian westerlies jet stream.

The lake is the largest one in a flood control reservoir system known as the Sola Cascade. In May and September 1970, separated by a big flood event in July, the lake was sampled for rock magnetic, chemical and granulometric studies. In 85% of the September samples, susceptibility decreases by 10 to 40% compared to the value measured in May. Seasonal changes are also observed in the total Fe content and some heavy metals. A general decrease in Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Cr content during the summer season was observed in the whole lake. The content of other metals such as Mn and Ni increased in samples taken in September. The changes observed in the lake sediments could be only an accidental result of the flood or may indeed result from seasonal changes fostered by the flood effect.

The changes in the salt-covered area in Lake Tuz between 1985 and 2021 (37 years), which have been obtained by August satellite images, are compared with those in groundwater and the 12-month Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) variations in the lake. The results show that the salt-covered area on the lake surface was most strongly correlated with the SPEI spring (-0.78, t test; p < 0.01) during the period of August 1985-2021, implying that the drought conditions in spring determines 62% of the salt-covered area on the lake in August. The groundwater storage (GWS) in June and July and the salt-covered area in August in Lake Tuz also depict a moderate correlation of -0.60 at 1% significance level from 1985 to 2021. The results illustrate that the SPEI and GWS values decreased, while the salt-covered area on the lake surface expanded in the Lake Tuz Basin over the past 37 years. The trends of the salt-covered area, SPEI, and GWS became especially pronounced after 1999, during which the SPEI change and similar changing trends appeared in the GWS and salt-covered area.

IMPACT OF NATURAL FACTORS ON MERCURY IN LAKES OF THE NORTH OF WESTERN SIBERIA	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the study is caused by the fact that mercury is involved in the global planetary biogeochemical cycle and is included in the food chain with the accumulation in organisms of predatory species of animals and in the indigenous population. With respect to Western Siberia, studies are fragmentary, and generalizations are made on small samples, which makes background studies of mercury content in the bottom sediments of lakes relevant in a representative sample. The aim of the study is to analyze and generalize the background space-time observations of the gross mercury content in the bottom sediments, as well as dissolved, depending on natural factors in the middle taiga within the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug. The object of study is the background concentration of dissolved Hg and mercury in the bottom sediments of lakes. 95 lakes, 322 samples of bottom sediments taken at different times were studied. Methods: atomic absorption spectrometry ("cold steam" method) determination of mercury in accredited laboratories in accordance with the guidelines. Background environmental monitoring data from 2007 to 2011 were used. Result. The average background concentration of mercury in bottom sediments is 0,046 +/- 0,012 mg/kg, dissolved mercury - 0,025 +/- 0,014 mg/kg. The highest concentration of Hg was found in the eluvial and transeluvial positions, the lowest - in superaqueous landscapes. The concentration of Hg is maximum in lake-ridge-hollow complex of peat bogs and lowest - in the bottom sediments of lakes in mineral soils. There is a tendency to increase the concentration of mercury in the bottom sediments of lakes from the tundra zone, the Northern taiga to the subzone of the middle taiga. However, bogging increases from south to north, which contributes to increase in mercury content in lake bottom sediments (R=0,4). There is an increase in dissolved mercury in lakes from West to East (longitude) (R=0,6). The assessment of changes in mercury content in bottom sediments suggests that mercury content is higher in winter than in summer. The concentration of dissolved mercury increases from west to east, but mercury from bottom sediments is not consistent with this.

Its surface is 143.7 ha and the maximum depth is 14.6 m. Few years ago it was strongly eutrophic with cyanobacterial water blooms. Restoration measures started in 2009 using three methods: oxygenation of hypolimnetic waters using wind aerators, phosphorus immobilization using iron treatment and biomanipulation measures - stocking the lake with pike fingerlings. The results of restoration measures were monitored during International Summer Schools, organized in July, as well as once every month during growing season, in years 2009-2011. Physico-chemical variables were measured and biological analyses were done every year with the same methods, making possible the evaluation of water quality and organism's composition changes during that time. The results of studies and evaluation of ecological state due to guidelines of Water Framework Directive indicated progressive improvement of water quality and ecological state of Lake Durowskie. The quickest improvement referred to physico-chemical variables of water quality, but they were highly variable during the seasons. Also phytoplankton changed quickly its composition and abundance, however, macrophytes and macroinvertebrates require longer time for reconstruction of their communities.

Clinical signs included inability to stand, anorexia, and weight loss. Clinicopathologic findings included heterophilic leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Histopathologic findings on all pelicans demonstrated severe, chronic, diffuse rhabdomyofiber degeneration and necrosis, making vitamin E deficiency a differential diagnosis despite routine supplementation. Based on tissue and pond water assays for the cyanobacterial toxin, microcystin, toxicosis is suspected as the inciting cause of death in these cases. We hypothesize that vitamin E exhaustion and resultant rhabdomyodegeneration and cardiomyopathy were sequelae to this toxicosis.					; Kottwitz, Jack/AIE-1039-2022	Sim, Richard/0000-0001-7525-0360; Kottwitz, Jack/0000-0001-7227-8325; Wilson, Alan/0000-0003-1080-0354													1042-7260	1937-2825				JUN	2020	51	2					407	415		10.1638/2019-0117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2019-0117								32549572					WOS:000541716600020

We studied the aerial micromycetes biodiversity of nine water bodies (spontaneously or anthropogenically formed) after brown coal mining in the Czech Republic. The results showed that the Cladosporium was the most abundant genus (93% of all identified genera). The highest number of aerial micromycetes was found in the terrestrial surroundings, especially in those with vegetation. The lowest level of aerial micromycetes was in habitats around the oldest lake with the greatest slope and low vegetation. The pit lakes of the Western Bohemia Basin showed the highest total number of aerial micromycetes of all studied locations. Seasonally, the highest counts of aerial micromycetes were detected in the autumn months. There are many publications on environmental restoration concerning plants, amphibians, and higher animals, however, microbial studies are scarce. Moreover, such studies are mainly focused on land restoration rather than on waterbodies. Therefore, results of this study will contribute to increased knowledge about post-mining water bodies and the local aerial micromycetes populations. Our findings also support the idea, that post-mining sites should be redeveloped in a more natural and spontaneous manner, rather than anthropogenically, which contributes to the lower biodiversity.					; Svarcova, Viviana/AAZ-6085-2021	Major, Vladimir/0000-0002-8730-3586; Svarcova, Viviana/0000-0002-5996-3181; Vondrakova, Lucie/0000-0002-7163-062X													0925-8574	1872-6992				JUN	2024	203								107246	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2024.107246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2024.107246		APR 2024											WOS:001227590900001
J	Kuttler, W; Lamp, T; Weber, K				Kuttler, W; Lamp, T; Weber, K			Summer air quality over an artificial lake	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In the summer of 1998, the air quality (indicators: CO, NO, NO2, O-3) above the water surface of the Lake Balderey (Essen, Ruhr area, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), an artificial lake used for recreation purposes, was measured using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) remote measurement methods. The take, with an area of 3 km 2 was created by damming the Ruhr and is surrounded by higher ground. In calm, bright weather conditions, this location results in a low-exchange situation (formation of temperature inversions, cold air dynamics) with a sustained impact on pollutant concentrations over the lake. The results of trace substance measurements (1/2 h mean values) were compared with values from comparison stations (suburban, high traffic and forest) located outside the area of the lake. In general, it was found that mean CO and NO concentrations over the lake were very low (0.3 ppm and 7.5 ppb, respectively). NO2 values (similar to 15 ppb) were some 3.5 times higher than those recorded at the forest station and 03 values, at 27 ppb, almost reached the same level as at the forest station (30 ppb). Mass flow densities as a function of wind direction, diurnal courses, differences between weekdays and weekends and comparisons with air quality standards are presented for the lake station.

Exploring qualitative applications of social media data for place-based assessments in destination planning	CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM												Understanding the physical attributes of a destination valued by visitors allows tourism managers to consider those components when planning, managing, and marketing destinations. However, determining the key components of visitors' destination image can be difficult. This study utilizes social media data to explore visitors' destination image of a nature-based tourism locale. Specifically, we examined user-generated content by visitors to the tourism region adjacent to Lake Superior in Minnesota USA during the summer 2015 tourism season. Content analysis was utilized to determine the major themes of visitors' destination image. Our findings are similar to those of existing studies: natural resources, built resources, and human subjects are the most prevalent components of destination image. However, our method of ascertaining these components of destination image - specifically, thematically analyzing social media data - present a technique that may be more easily accessible to tourism providers, as it can be a lower cost and time investment. We discuss how these findings can inform the development of recreation opportunities and marketing materials. This qualitative analysis of social media data can be applied in other locales as a relatively efficient and real-time method to inform place-based management and marketing.					; Smith, Jordan/AAR-9126-2021	Davenport, Mae/0000-0002-8242-5074; McCreary, Allie/0000-0003-2332-3999; 													1368-3500	1747-7603					2020	23	1					82	98		10.1080/13683500.2019.1571023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2019.1571023													WOS:000519791100006
J	Croley, TE; Lewis, CFM				Croley, Thomas E., II; Lewis, C. F. Michael			Warmer and drier climates that make terminal great lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A recent empirical model of glacial-isostatic uplift showed that the Huron and Michigan lake level fell tens of meters below the lowest possible outlet about 7,900 C-14 years BP when the upper Great Lakes became dependent for water supply on precipitation alone, as at present. The upper Great Lakes thus appear to have been impacted by severe dry climate that may have also affected the lower Great Lakes. While continuing paleoclimate studies are corroborating and quantifying this impacting climate and other evidence of terminal lakes, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory applied their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System, modified to use dynamic lake areas, to explore the deviations from present temperatures and precipitation that would force the Great Lakes to become terminal (closed), i.e., for water levels to fall below outlet sills. We modeled the present lakes with pre-development natural outlet and water flow conditions, but considered the upper and lower Great Lakes separately with no river connection, as in the early Holocene basin configuration. By using systematic shifts in precipitation, temperature, and humidity, relative to the present base climate, we identified candidate climates that result in terminal lakes. The lakes would close in the order: Erie, Superior, Michigan-Huron, and Ontario for increasingly drier and warmer climates. For a temperature rise of T degrees C and a precipitation drop of P% relative to the present base climate, conditions for complete lake closure range from 4.7T + P > 51 for Erie to 3.5T + P > 71 for Ontario.																			0380-1330						2006	32	4					852	869		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[852:WADCTM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[852:WADCTM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243172100017

Native macrophyte community response to water-level manipulation for an invasive species	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Disturbance regimes related to water level fluctuation play an important role in the structuring of aquatic macrophyte communities. In managed systems, winter water level drawdowns have shown promise in controlling populations of nuisance macrophytes, however, drawdowns may have unintended negative consequences on erosion, fauna, and non-target plant species. The Chippewa Flowage, located in Sawyer County, WI, has implemented targeted winter water level drawdowns with the goal of reducing nuisance levels of Myriophyllum spicatum. To evaluate the effects of water level drawdowns on Myriophyllum spicatum and the native macrophyte community, we conducted repeated full lake surveys of aquatic macrophytes at 2018 points under drawdown and normal water level management in 2005/06, 2015, and 2017. We supplemented these efforts with downscaled surveys in 2007, 2010, and 2016. Surveys revealed a statistically significant decline in both Myriophyllum spicatum occurrence and abundance, and average macrophyte abundance during active drawdown management. Kernel distributions of change in point-specific c-value between the two time periods showed a significant increase under drawdown conditions, and a decrease under normal management (D = 0.41, P <= 0.0001). Drawdown management appeared to successfully control Myriophyllum spicatum abundance and allowed for improvements in the floristic quality of the macrophyte community but resulted in reduced macrophyte abundance overall.

J	Anderson, FW; Falk, P				Anderson, FW; Falk, P			Observations on the ecology of the central desert of Iceland	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The central plateau of Iceland (70,000 sq. km.) consists of a desert of lava, gravel and blown sand, founded on its southern edge by an irregular line of small ice caps. Four types of vegetation are described and the influence of water supply, soil movement, and temp. is traced. (1) The screes and valleys bear almost no vegetation. Very occasional plants of Cerastium, Arabis, Armeria, Silene, Elymus, Usnea, Rhacomitrium were found. There is no ground fauna. Large numbers of Diptera came to the camp in this area every day from the oases. Two snow buntings and a dead Faroe snipe were seen. (2) Oases occur along streams and around springs and lakes where the following genera occur: Salix, Empetrum, Ranunculus, Carex, Poa, Calamagrostis, Festuca, Deschampsia, Euphrasia, Polygonum, Equisetum, Hypnum, Aulacomnium, Webera, Swartzia, Conostomium, Philonotis, Rhacomitrium, Leptobryum, Encalyptra. Along streams mosses are more abundant, Marchantia is occasional, and fungi (chiefly agarics and discomycetes) are abundant. Volant animals were mostly Lepidoptera, Trichop-tera, and Diptera. A pair of whooper swans were seen, and also snow buntings, harlequin ducks, long-tailed ducks, and red-necked phalaropes. (3) On hill tops the soil movement is less than on scree slopes and valleys, and plants are more abundant. (4) A series of hot springs (62[degree] C. in the center and 48-52[degree] around the margins) have in the center a dense growth of an unidentified green alga and numerous Cypridae. Large numbers of Borboridae, Cordyluridae, Chironomidae, and Simuliidae gather over the hot springs and deposit their eggs in the water and the decaying algae. On the slopes down which it flows this water is depositing calcium carbonate which binds the loose lava and provides a stable area for plant colonization. Mud is also deposited. Marchantia and other plants occur. Animals are Mitopus morio, Hilaria frigida, and Nebria gyllenhali. Outside the mud zone are 3 concentric zones, each dominated by a different moss: Brachythecium rivulare, Philonotus fontana var. tomentella, and Aulacomnium palustre. Soil movement and lack of water are together responsible for the general absence of vegetation in the desert. Height of soil surface above the water table determines the vegetation zones in the oases. A possible reconstruction of the course of the colonization of this desert by plants and animals is discussed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1935	23						406	421		10.2307/2256128	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2256128													WOS:000200135600015

A topographic template for estimating soil carbon pools in forested catchments	GEODERMA												There is a growing need to describe and quantify the heterogeneity in soil carbon pools in forests. In landscapes where topography is an important control on geomorphological, hydrological and/or biogeochemical processes, topographic features can be useful for partitioning the landscape into homogeneous units of soil carbon. Of particular interest are topographic features that are rare or cover a small proportion of the landscape but are disproportionately important in terms of soil carbon pools and/or fluxes. We developed an automated method for classifying topographic features by combining expert knowledge and a probabilistic approach. The topographic features were then used as a template from which to collect samples to estimate carbon of canopy leaves, freshly fallen litter, the forest floor, and the organic-rich A horizon or peat to a 5 cm depth within a small catchment of the Turkey Lakes Watershed of central Ontario. While the carbon in canopy foliage was homogeneous, there was significant heterogeneity in soil carbon pools among the topographic features, reflecting the importance of physical processes in shaping the distribution of soil carbon pools within this forested landscape. The catchment-aggregated estimates were under-estimated by 17% when only the dominant topographic feature was considered (i.e., 242 Mg C if backslope only used compared to 291 Mg C if all topographic features used). A Monte Carlo simulation method used to bound the uncertainty in soil carbon pools within each topographic feature resulted in catchment-aggregated estimates of 288 +/- 56.0 (maximum probability) and 290 +/- 51.3 Mg C (weighted probability) in the combined freshly fallen litter, forest floor, and the organic-rich A horizon or peat pool. The creation and application of this topographic template was useful for detecting, strategically sampling, and then mapping and scaling heterogeneity in soil carbon pools on the landscape.

J	Cremer, H; Wagner, B; Melles, M; Hubberten, HW				Cremer, H; Wagner, B; Melles, M; Hubberten, HW			The postglacial environmental development of Raffles So, East Greenland: inferences from a 10,000 year diatom record	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A 341 cm long sediment sequence was recovered from the unofficially named Raffles So on Raffles O, outer Scoresby Sund region, East Greenland. The sediment sequence consists in the upper part (0-230 cm) of a stratified gyttja enriched in organic carbon and biogenic silica whereas the lower core part (235-341 cm) is composed of terrigenous, consolidated glacio-limnic sediments. C-14-AMS measurements indicate that the sediment sequence represents the entire Holocene lake history from 10,030 calibrated radiocarbon years. The geochemical parameters (opal, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN)) and the total diatom concentration show similar developments during the Holocene, and reflect changes in biological production and nutrient input into the lake. These records clearly reveal a broad Holocene TOC-opal-maximum interval between 5200 and 1800 cal. yrs BP. The diatom flora consisted of 66 taxa representing 20 genera but only seven taxa were abundant and, sometimes, these were monospecifically dominant during the Holocene. In the sediment core from Raffles So four successive stratigraphical zones can be distinguished. Accumulation of diatom valves began at 9900 cal. yrs BP with a Stephanodiscus minutulus (Kutz.) Cleve and Moller dominated assemblage (stratigraphic zone 1) followed by a diatom flora dominated by Cyclotella pseudostelligera Hustedt and, less frequently, by Diatoma tenuis Agardh (9400 until 5900 cal. yrs BP, zone 2). Cyclotella sp. A, a taxon which belongs to the Cyclotella rossii-comensis-tripartita-complex, was the dominant floral element between 5200 and 1800 cal. yrs BP (zone 3). From 1800 cal. yrs BP, the periphytic taxa Fragilaria capucina var. gracilis (Ostr.) Hustedt and F. capucina var. rumpens (Kutz.) Lange-Bertalot attained highest relative abundances, also almost monospecifically (zone 4). The distribution and composition of the diatom assemblages in the sediment record from Raffles So probably reflect past variations in the extent of the lake-ice cover during the growing season. More or less ice-free conditions during summer may have prevailed during the early Holocene until ca. 1800 cal. yrs BP, which allowed growth of planktonic diatoms (Cyclotella taxa) in the pelagic lake region. From 1800 cal. yrs BP, colder conditions lead to a perennial lake-ice cover with a small ice-free moat in summer which favored the growth of periphytic, littoral species (Fragilaria capucina varieties).					; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; 													0921-2728						2001	26	1					67	87		10.1023/A:1011179321529	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011179321529													WOS:000168817600005

Cells fixed on membrane filters were hybridized with a probe specific for the domain Bacteria as well as with probes for the alpha, beta, and gamma subclasses of the class Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group. The fraction of bacteria detectable after hybridization with the bacterial probe EUB ranged from 40 to 81% of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counts. The bacterial assemblage varied considerably between and within different habitats (snow, slush, and lake water) but was in most cases dominated by members of the beta subclass (6.5 to 116% of bacteria detectable with probe EUB), The sum of bacteria hybridizing with group-specific probes was usually lower than the fraction detectable with probe EUB. Image analysis was used to characterize morphology and the size-specific biomass distribution of bacterial assemblages, which clearly separated the three habitats, Although the measured secondary production parameters and the fraction of 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride-reducing bacteria varied by more than an order of magnitude in the different slush and pelagic layers, detectability with the fluorescent probe EUB was constantly high, Physiological strategies of bacteria under nutrient limitation and at low temperatures are discussed in the context of the ribosome content of single cells.

J	Rodríguez-Villafañe, C; Bécares, E; Fernández-Aláez, M				Rodriguez-Villafane, Carlos; Becares, Eloy; Fernandez-Alaez, Margarita			Waterfowl grazing effects on submerged macrophytes in a shallow Mediterranean Lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												Waterfowl exclusion cages were set up in Sentiz Lake, an eutrophic shallow lake in Leon (NW of Spain) in order to determine the role of waterfowl herbivory on macrophyte biomass and species composition. Total macrophyte biomass was high during the study (250 g DW m(-2) in summer). The macrophyte community was mainly formed by Myriophyllum alterniflorum (95% cover), Ceratophyllum demersum (5%) and Potamogeton gramineus (< 0.5%). High densities of co-occurring coots (Fulica atra; 24 ind/ha) and ducks (Anas penelope, A. strepera and A. platyrhynchos; 18 ind/ha) did not have a significant effect on macrophyte biomass in the lake. There were no statistical differences between total biomass inside and outside the exclosures, although plant biomass reached a higher value inside the cages than in the lake. Biomass species composition was significantly different inside and outside exclosures; C. deinersum was more abundant in the cages than in the lake. P gramineits, almost absent in the lake, became co-dominant with M. alterniflorum in some exclosures. The detailed study of M. alternifloruln flower buds in summer showed significant herbivory by coots. Flower bud abundance was lower in the lake (35% lower in June; 85% lower in July) than under waterfowl exclusion. The effect of waterfowl on macrophyte biomass in Mediterranean wetlands seems to be negligible as compared to effects identified in northern European lakes. Apart from an important role in dispersal, waterfowl in Mediterranean areas have a strong qualitative effect on the structure of plant communities by selecting most palatable species or their reproductive structures.

J	Chung, WS; Yu, MJ; Lee, HD				Chung, WS; Yu, MJ; Lee, HD			Prediction of corrosion rates of water distribution pipelines according to aggressive corrosive water in Korea	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					International Conference on Scaling and Corrosion in Water and Wastewater Systems	MAR 25-27, 2003	Cranfield, ENGLAND	IWA				The drinking water network serving Korea has been used for almost 100 years. Therefore, pipelines have suffered various degrees of deterioration due to aggressive environments. The pipe breaks were caused by in-external corrosion, water hammer, surface loading, etc. In this paper, we focused on describing corrosion status in water distribution pipes in Korea and reviewing some methods to predict corrosion rates. Results indicate that corrosive water of lakes was more aggressive than river water and the winter was more aggressive compared to other seasons. The roughness growth rates of Dongbok lake showed 0.23 mm/year. The high variation of corrosion rates is controlled by the aging pipes and smaller diameter. Also the phenolphthalein test on a cementitious core of cement mortar lined ductile cast iron pipe indicated the pipes over 15 years old had lost 50similar to100% of their lime active cross sectional area.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2004	49	2					19	26		10.2166/wst.2004.0078	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2004.0078								14982159					WOS:000220036100004

To ascertain the possibility of source region As enrichment, samples of water (n = 86), stream sediment (n = 77) and soil (n = 73) were collected from the Singe Tsangpo (upstream of the Indus River), Yarlung Tsangpo (upstream of the Brahmaputra River) and other drainage basins in Tibet in June of 2008. The average arsenic concentration in stream waters, sediments and soils was 58 +/- 70 mu g/L (n = 39, range 2-252 mu g/L), 42 +/- 40 mg/kg (n = 37, range 12-227 mg/kg), and 44 +/- 27 mg/kg (n = 28, range 12-84 mg/kg) respectively for the Singe Tsangpo and was 11 +/- 17 mu g/L (n = 30, range 2-83 mu/L), 28 +/- 11 mg/kg (n = 28, range 2-61 mg/kg), and 30 +/- 34 mg/kg (n = 21, range 6-173 mg/kg) respectively for the Yarlung Tsangpo. A dug well contained 195 mu g/L of As. In addition to elevated As levels in surface and shallow groundwater of Tibet, hot spring and alkaline salt lake waters displayed very high As levels, reaching a maximum value of 5,985 mu g/L and 10,626 mu g/L As, respectively. The positive correlation between [As] and [Na] + [K] in stream waters indicates that these surface water arsenic enrichments are linked to the hot springs and/or salt lakes. Further, 24% of As in stream sediment is reductively leachable, with bulk As displaying a positive correlation with stream water As, suggesting sorption from stream water. In contrast, the fraction of reductively leachable As is negligible for soils and several rock samples, suggesting that As in them is associated with un-weathered minerals. Whether the pronounced As anomaly found in Tibet affects the sedimentary As content in deltas downstream or not requires further study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Influences of Body Size, Habitat Quality, and Competition on the Movement and Survival of Juvenile Coho Salmon during the Early Stages of Stream Recolonization	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Understanding the factors influencing the success of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in newly colonized habitats is essential to their recovery in large areas across the West Coast of the United States and Canada. We studied biotic and abiotic factors associated with survival during the early stages of colonization and population establishment of juvenile coho salmon O. kisutch in Rock Creek, a tributary of the upper Cedar River in the Lake Washington basin of Puget Sound, Washington. The stream was occupied by resident fishes (e. g., rainbow trout O. mykiss, cutthroat trout O. clarkii, speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus, and several sculpins Cottus spp.), but adult coho salmon and other anadromous fishes had been excluded by a dam from 1901 until fish ladder installation in 2003. We defined logistic regression models and used an information-theoretic approach to predict apparent survival with various combinations of individual fish condition, location competition, and local habitat quality. The best-approximating models included measures of brood year, body size, habitat, and migration timing. Survival was positively associated with body size and habitat quality and negatively associated with competition. Survival from late summer to smolt migration varied among years (mean +/- SD = 27 +/- 11%) and was significantly higher within Rock Creek (73 +/- 11%) than during seaward migration in the Cedar River and Lake Washington (38 +/- 14%). Juvenile coho salmon established a population and outnumbered resident salmonid species by 40% in the lower 2 km of Rock Creek within 5 years of colonization. Overall, the results revealed the linkage between the colonization success of juvenile coho salmon and the biotic features and habitat quality in a newly accessible environment during the stream-rearing phase of their life history.					; Pess, George/NOF-9114-2025	Liermann, Martin/0009-0004-5019-1471; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2011	140	4					883	897		10.1080/00028487.2011.587752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.587752													WOS:000296142700001

Microfossil analyses record the gradual transition of the isolation basin from a marine basin to a freshwater lake within an area of isostatic uplift (the basin isolation contact is dated 12,040 +/- 110BP). The new data, correlated with previously published data from isolation basins at Rumach and Loch nan Eala, provide evidence for a continuous fall in relative sea level in northwest Scotland from the early-Lateglacial Interstadial to the early Holocene. This conflicts with previously published reconstructions of relative sealevel changes from a number of areas in Scotland which show rapid falls and rises during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Trends similar to those predicted by geophysical (numerical) models are inferred from these new data. Palynological, foraminiferal and dinoflagellate cyst stratigraphy link the oceanic record of major climate and oceanic circulation changes to the terrestrial biostratigraphic record. Movement of the oceanic Polar Front, west and north, during a period of relative climatic amelioration within the early-mid Lateglacial Interstadial and a corresponding change in the position of the North Atlantic Current may be inferred from the dinoflagellate cyst record.

In this study, 133 phytolith samples were collected as proxy indicators from lacustrine sediments of the Zhunzhahanjilin (ZZH) profile in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, China. The phytolith samples were then analyzed to quantitatively reconstruct the Holocene paleotemperature at the millennial scale. Based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), C-14 dates and an ordered clustering method were used to divide the phytoliths into five assemblage zones with environmental significance. The quantitative reconstruction results indicated that the paleotemperature in the Badain Jaran Desert was relatively high during the early Holocene (11,040-8,200 cal a BP), and the average paleotemperature was approximately 9.5 & DEG;C. This may have led to increased melt water near the surrounding area and recharged the lakes in the Badain Jaran Desert, resulting in the expansion of the lakes during the early Holocene. The average paleotemperature during the middle Holocene (8,200-3,100 cal a BP) was approximately 7.9 & DEG;C. This period was warm and the environment was humid, with extensive precipitation from summer monsoons and low evaporation leading to higher water levels in the lakes. The paleotemperature decreased during the late Holocene (3,100 cal a BP to the present), and lakes retreated or dried up because of the decreased summer monsoon rains. The Holocene paleotemperature in the Badain Jaran Desert may have been related to July insolation in the Northern Hemisphere and had a range of impacts on the hydrological cycle in this arid region.

J	Craft, ED				Craft, ED			The value of weather information services for nineteenth-century Great Lakes shipping	AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW												The U.S. government established a national weather organization in 1870. Changes in Great Lakes cargo and hull losses, and shipping rates from Chicago to Buffalo, provide evidence of the value of storm warnings on the Great Lakes. Nearly half of the Great Lakes storm-warning stations were closed during the fall of 1883 because of appropriations reductions. This exogenous shock permits the econometric estimation of the value of storm-warning locations on the Great Lakes. The results indicate that the social rate of return for weather expenditures during the Weather Bureau's founding period was at least 60 percent.

J	Erwin, RM				Erwin, RM			The ecology of cormorants: Some research needs and recommendations	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												Concerns about Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) have arisen because of their rapid population increase across North America and their economic impact on several aquaculture and commercial fish industries. Ln spite of the concern for cormorants, little published research is available that addresses either basic population biology questions or management issues. Based on a literature review I recommend that research be conducted in four areas. First, a large-scale banding and marking program should be initiated so that population models can be used to estimate age- and sex-specific survival and fecundity (as has been done for the Shag [P. aristotelis] in Europe). By marking individual birds, survival and movement rates can be estimated between nesting colonies, which will provide information about potential source versus sink colonies. Second, studies of movements during migration and winter are required. Presently, no data are available on habitat use during migration or on the length-of-stay by individual birds. This has important implications to how cormorants interact with other fish and wildlife species over a broad range. Studies of movements during winter with radio-marked birds should indicate whether the ''problem birds'' at aquaculture sites are merely a few specialists. Third, limiting factors, such as contaminants and disease, should receive further investigation, especially in light of recent concerns over the outbreak of Newcastle disease. The relationship between contaminant levels and developmental abnormalities in young cormorants in certain areas of the Great Lakes in Canada and the United States remains equivocal. Fourth, further studies are needed to document the economic impacts of cormorants on Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and other cultured fishes and to determine ways to reduce predation by fish-eating birds. Mesocosm experiments should be conducted to evaluate how different fish extraction rates affect final productivity of fish. Controlled experiments with different exclusion and scaring devices are needed. With radio-marked birds, ii should be determined what the behavioral responses are to the different scaring devises. Also, providing alternative wetland feeding sites in regions of fish farm depredation might alleviate some of the pressure on farmers. Studies with radio-marked birds could evaluate effects of manipulation of ''natural'' wetlands on use by birds during the winter period. Finally any research directed at the Double-crested Cormorant should also evaluate its interactions with other fish-eating waterbirds.																			0738-6028						1995	18				1		240	246		10.2307/1521545	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521545													WOS:A1995TM97000027

Annual events of peak lake stage and of severe floods have increased dramatically during the past few decades. This trend is related primarily to levee construction at the periphery of the lake and along the middle of the Changjiang (Yangtze River), which protects a large rural population. These levees reduce the area formerly available for floodwater storage resulting in higher lake stages during the summer flood season and catastrophic levee failures. The most severe floods in the Poyang Lake since 1950, and ranked in descending order of severity, occurred in 1998, 1995, 1954, 1983, 1992, 1973, and 1977. All of these floods occurred during or immediately following El Nino events, which are directly linked to rainfall in central China. The 2-year recurrence interval for maximum annual lake stage during El Nino years is 1.2 m higher than during non-El Nino years. The 10-year recurrence interval is 1.4 m higher during El Nino years than during non-El Nino years.

The community of ciliates was dominated by five orders: Oligotrichida, Haptorida, Prostomatida, Scuticociliatida and Peritrichida. The community composition varied greatly with depth. In the epilimnion, the ciliate numbers were dominated by oligotrichs but small algivorous prostomatids, peritrichs and haptorids were also numerous. In the metalimnion, these groups were replaced by scuticociliates and mixotrophic prostomatids. In the hypolimnion species known as benthic migrants appeared. We found a positive significant correlation (p < 0.05) between ciliate numbers and Chl a and bacterial densities. Only in the hypolimnion, the correlation between ciliates numbers and Chl a was not significant.					; Zingel, Priit/H-8822-2016	Ott, Ingmar/0000-0002-9036-1736; Zingel, Priit/0000-0003-1629-2063													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2000	435	1-3					19	26		10.1023/A:1004021103681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004021103681													WOS:000165253800003

This plant assemblage represents a peat-forming phytocoenosis buried in situ by volcanic ash-fall as indicated by frequent occurrence of upright stems rooted in the underlying coal and large plant fragments occurring at the base of the tuff. It is a low-diversity herbaceous and subarborescent assemblage dominated by small ferns and calamites with subdominant lycopsids not taller than about 1-1.5 m. This unique herbaceous assemblage comprises four fern species (Kidstonia heracleensis, Dendraena pinnatilobata, Desmopteris alethopteroides and Sphenopteris cirrhifolia), Calamites sp. and the small lycopsid Spencerites leismanii. Each species bears mature fertile organs with spores that indicate them to represent small but fully mature plants and not juvenile arborescent taxa. This plant assemblage is interpreted as a pioneer phytocoenosis that colonised a shallowed pond or lake, and that developed in the Lower Radnice Coal mire after flooding. Comparison of the phytocoenosis preserved in tuff bed at the base of the Whetstone Horizon in the Stilec opencast mine with coeval plant assemblages from the same bed in other localities reveals its unique character. Comparison of the palynological record from the roof of the Lower Radnice Coal with the taphocoenosis preserved in the "belka" tuff bed overlying this coal and the allochtonous taphocoenosis of the laminated tuffite above belka indicates a close co-existence of this low-diversity herbaceous phytocoenosis with the high-diversity lepidodendrid lycopsid dominating assemblage.

One of them are lakes of the Gardnierisko-Lebska Lowland. Each of these reservoirs has its own hydrological and ecological specificity, which results in the fact that knowledge about these dynamic water ecosystems is incomplete and requires further researches. The aim of this work was to study seasonal changes in bacterial diversity in coastal brackish lakes: Sarbsko and Lebsko. Biodiversity was studied for salinity gradient, as well as physicochemical and biological changes (caused by seasons and depth of the reservoir from which the test material was taken). To monitor the genotypic variation of individual microorganisms and estimate biodiversity of the bacterial community in the settlement and to estimate the genotype complexity of the samples PCR-DGGE method (polymerase chain reaction, combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) was used. The molecular marker used in the studies was a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. The effects of the experiment were documented in the form of photos in the ultraviolet light of the PCR-DGGE products, on the basis of which densitometric analysis was performed, Dice similarity coefficient and Shannon biodiversity index was calculated, and dendrograms were created based on the nearest neighbor algorithm. The research showed that the biodiversity of the community during the experiment was not constant and ranged from relatively poor to average genotypically rich. The lowest values of the Shannon index were observed in the summer, which was related to salinity fluctuations and high temperature. In the summer, a decrease in the similarity of Dice in the Lebsko lake was also observed. Such a situation did not take place in Sarbsko. The project showed that Sarbsko has a more stable bacterial diversity, which is indicated by smaller fluctuations in the Shannon biodiversity index. It was observed that bacteria genotypic structure has changed slightly in seasonal cycle in tha Sarbsko lake, as dendrograms show. Temperature through the seasons also influence the bacterial biodiversity. What is more relation between biodiversity and oxygen concentration had been noticed. During the experiment there were no changes in pH level and this parameter has not got influence on bacteria.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; 													1506-218X						2018	20		2				1830	1858																WOS:000469166100052

Due to shorter wavelength and large bandwidth (480MHz) which leads to a higher sensitivity to different surface conditions, AltiKa shows more clearly the separation between open water and various ice types. We observe significant decrease of backscatter (25-30dB) in late spring for both ENVISAT and SARAL and discuss it in the context of ice metamorphism. There is a clear need to continue and expand our dedicated field studies of lake Baikal ice cover to better assess influence of ice structure on altimetric signal.

The contribution of zooplankton to the total Cd pool was consistently low (<< 1%) only in clear water lakes with pH < 5.0. In three intensively studied lakes, the contribution of zooplankton to total aqueous Cd varied with time and depth, the maximum contribution (4 to 6%) occurring in the metalimnion in mid-summer. Changes with depth and time were principally a product of seasonal changes in zooplankton biomass and seasonal succession of species with inherently different tendencies to accumulate Cd. Implications for the study of Cd cycling in lakes are discussed.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0049-6979					AUG	1991	57-8						635	644		10.1007/BF00282927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00282927													WOS:A1991GP12100066

Spatial variations in the geochemistry of glacial meltwater streams in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, flow during the summer melt season (4-12 weeks) when air temperatures are close to the freezing point of water. Because of the low precipitation rates, streams originate from glacial meltwater and flow to closed-basin lakes on the valley floor. Water samples have been collected from the streams in the Dry Valleys since the start of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research project in 1993 and these have been analysed for ions and nutrient chemistry. Controls such as landscape position, morphology of the channels, and biotic and abiotic processes are thought to influence the stream chemistry. Sea-salt derived ions tend to be higher in streams that are closer to the ocean and those streams that drain the Taylor Glacier in western Taylor Valley. Chemical weathering is an important process influencing stream chemistry throughout the Dry Valleys. Nutrient availability is dependent on landscape age and varies with distance from the coast. The streams in Taylor Valley span a wide range in composition and total dissolved solids and are surprisingly similar to a wide range of much larger temperate and tropical river systems.

This is possibly due to the general notion that this nutrient source is not quantitatively important compared to riverine sources considering the fact that the absolute load of atmospheric inputs is a function of the collecting surface area of the lakes. However, it should be noted that nutrient input relative to the size of the lake is more relevant than the absolute load for eutrophication-related water quality problems. Furthermore, for lakes located in arid and semi-arid regions where dry weather conditions prevail during most of the times of the year, riverine inputs of nutrients are greatly reduced. On the other hand, atmospheric input of nutrients through dry fall could be considerable. The results of the eight-month sampling of the present study show that the areal total phosphorus load originating exclusively from atmospheric source, L (P), was 195.05 mg m(-2)making the model-predicted in-lake total phosphorus (TP) concentration,P(lambda,)to be 11.84 mg m(-3). This value surpassed the cutoff point of 10 mg m(-3)for oligotrophic state making the reservoir mesotrophic based on the probabilistic distribution of trophic state. This suggests that atmospheric sources could sustain the supply of phosphorus during the dry period when riverine input is greatly reduced or even after complete control of riverine sources is achieved. Our results also show that atmospheric input of other nutrients, particularly ammonia, which may trigger the emergence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria, was considerable.																			2509-9426	2509-9434				JUN	2021	5	2					473	480		10.1007/s41748-020-00162-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41748-020-00162-w		JUN 2020											WOS:000544641400001

It also receives waters from streams, possible seepage from Lake Turkana, and hot springs. Present hydrochemistry and sedimentology is controlled by numerous factors including seasonal variations, composition of incoming waters, water depth and, above all, bacterial activity. Given the scarcity of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the lake waters, bacterial activity seems to intensify the alkalinization of the waters which inhibits the deposition of organic matter and leads to the genesis of a poorly organic, zeolitic mud that reaches 1.5 m in tickness in the deepest part of the lake. This black layer may be overlaid with thin crusts of trona and halite which prograde over the basin from its southern bank when the lake is drying out and which are dissolved in the lake waters during the rainy season.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					99	112		10.1007/BF00018793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018793													WOS:A1993MB13700007

Abdel			Reproductive studies on the carpet clam Paphia textile (Paratapes textilis) (Gmelin 1791) (Family: Veneridae): a guide of aquaculture management along the Egyptian coasts of the Red Sea and Suez Canal	BMC ZOOLOGY												Background Most aquatic biota's reproductive biology and life cycle are essential to the sustainable management and development of coastal ecosystems and aquaculture. The bivalve Paphia textile (Gmelin 1791), also known as Paratapes textilis, has an economic value in Indo-Pacific waters, including the Red Sea and the Suez Canal lakes, the Egyptian coasts. However, P. textile suffers from extensive fishing and exploitation. Aim The present work aims to study the Paphia textile's reproductive cycle on the Egyptian coasts of the Red Sea for the first time. It helps to manage and develop the coastal ecosystems and aquaculture. Methodology Samples were collected monthly from two saline lakes in the Suez Gulf from December 2019 to November 2020. As part of the comprehensive research study, sex ratio, condition index, sexuality, histological analysis of gonads, shell size, and gonad index were used to investigate the reproductive cycle. Results The results reveal a male-biased sex ratio, possibly due to anthropogenic stressors. The Paphia textile is dioecious. No hermaphrodite cases were observed in the studied specimens. The condition index in winter and spring indicates periods dominated by mature individuals. Five reproductive maturity stages were assigned for both P. textile males and females. Due to the simultaneous development of several developmental stages monthly throughout the sampling year, warm water may be responsible for non-sequential gametogenic cycles. As measured environmental parameters correlate with maturity stages, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a play important role in gonad growth. The size at first sexual maturity at which 50% of the Paphia textile population reached maturity ranged from 28.60 to 31.50 mm for females, and between 31.70 and 34.10 mm for males. As the gonad index increases during the ripe stages, this index decreases during the resting, spawning, and spent phases. Conclusions The findings suggest the most suitable temperature for aquaculture spawning is between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C in subtropical waters. Fishing should generally be prohibited at sizes less than 28.60 mm for better management and sustainability of this valuable aquatic resource on the Egyptian coasts of the Red Sea.

THE CHIEMGAU METEORITE IMPACT AND TSUNAMI EVENT (SOUTHEAST GERMANY): FIRST OSL DATING	MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY & ARCHAEOMETRY					1st Symposium on Luminescence in Archaeology International Symposia (LAIS)	SEP 09-12, 2009	Delphi, GREECE	Prefecture of Fokida, Municipal Delphi, Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Technol Educ Inst (TEI) Lamia, Reg Council Cent Greece				A more exact dating of the Chiemgau meteorite impact in Bavaria, southeast Germany, that produced a large strewn field of more than 80 craters sized between a few meters and several hundred meters, may provide the indispensable fundament for evaluating its cultural implications and thus enable an extraordinary case study. A straightforward answer has not yet been provided due to e.g. scarce existence of diagnostic material, lack of specialised micromorphologists, absence of absolute dating data etc. Here we report on a first OSL dating applied to a catastrophic impact layer that features both impact ejecta and tsunami characteristics attributed to proposed falls of projectiles into Lake Chiemsee in the impact event. The OSL dating was conducted on a quartzite cobble and four sediment samples collected from an excavated archaeological stratigraphy at Lake Chiemsee that comprised also the impact layer. In a first approach the analyses were based on the assumption of zero luminescence resetting clock from the induced impact shock for the quartzite cobble, and a solar bleaching of tsunami-generated sediments. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) was applied using the Single Aliquot Regeneration (SAR) protocol and relevant reliability criteria. For sediments the beta-TL method was also applied. Reported ages fall around the beginning of 2(nd) millennium BC. Special attention is given to the peculiar situation of OSL dating of material that may have been exposed to impact shock of strongly varying intensity, to excavation, ejection and ejecta emplacement, the latter overprinted by and mixed with tsunami transport processes resulting in possibly very complex bleaching scenarios largely differing from the original assumptions.

The water flow direction depends on the position of the watershed between Vistula and Pregola Rivers which can vary depending on the water level and the magnitude of the water outflow from the Pisa and Wegorapa Rivers. The studies aimed to analyze the changes in the hydrological regime and the ecological state of these lakes in 2008 and 2010-2012. In June 2010, the bifurcation zone occurred in the central part of the system due to the high quantity of precipitation. A positive heterograde oxygen curve in summer was in less eutrophic lakes, while a negative heterograde oxygen curve in more eutrophic lakes and a clinograde oxygen curve in highly eutrophic lakes. Phosphorus content was typical of medium or highly eutrophic lakes; therefore classifications based on physicochemical elements indicated below good ecological potential and status of all lakes. The least intensive phytoplankton growth was in the Northern Basin whereas the most intensive in the Southern Basin. Biological assessments based on phytoplankton indicated maximum potential in two lakes and good potential and status in five lakes, whereas the remaining lakes had moderate, poor, and bad potential and status. In 2010, when oxygen conditions improved significantly, the classification based on PMPL indicated significant deterioration up to bad ecological potential and status, in the lakes within the bifurcation zone and in several lakes in the Southern and Northern Basins.

Here, we present a high-resolution pollen record covering the last glacial maximum and the early Holocene from a closed crater Lake Moon to reconstruct vegetation history during the glacial-interglacial transition and thus register the evolution of the EASM during the last deglaciation. The vegetation history has gone through distinct changes from subalpine meadow in the last glacial maximum to dry steppe dominated by Artemisia from 20.3 to 17.4 ka BP, subalpine meadow dominated by Cyperaceae and Artemisia between 17.4 and 14.4 ka BP, and forest steppe dominated by Betula and Artemisia after 14.4 ka BP. The pollen-based temperature index demonstrates a gradual warming trend started at around 20.3 ka BP with interruptions of several brief events. Two cold conditions occurred around at 17.2-16.6 ka BP and 12.8-11.8 ka BP, temporally correlating to the Henrich 1 and the Younger Dryas events respectively, 1and abrupt warming events occurred around at 14.4 ka BP and 11.8 ka BP, probably relevant to the beginning of the Bolling-Allerod stages and the Holocene. The pollen-based moisture proxy shows distinct drought condition during the last glacial maximum (20.3-18.0 ka BP) and the Younger Dryas. The climate history based on pollen record of Lake Moon suggests that the regional temperature variability was coherent with the classical climate in the North Atlantic, implying the dominance of the high latitude processes on the EASM evolution from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to early Holocene. The local humidity variability was influenced by the EASM limitedly before the Bolling-Allerod warming, which is mainly controlled by the summer rainfall due to the EASM front covering the Northeast China after that.

Long-term trends in diatom diversity and palaeoproductivity: a 16 000-year multidecadal record from Lake Baikal, southern Siberia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Biological diversity is inextricably linked to community stability and ecosystem functioning, but our understanding of these relationships in freshwater ecosystems is largely based on short-term observational, experimental, and modelling approaches. Using a multidecadal diatom record for the past ca. 16 000 years from Lake Baikal, we investigate how diversity and palaeoproductivity have responded to climate change during periods of both rapid climate fluctuation and relative climate stability. We show dynamic changes in diatom communities during the past 16 000 years, with decadal shifts in species dominance punctuating millennial-scale seasonal trends. We describe for the first time in Lake Baikal a gradual shift from spring to autumnal diatom communities that started during the Younger Dryas and peaked during the Late Holocene, which likely represents orbitally driven ecosystem responses to long-term changes in seasonality. Using a multivariate classification tree, we show that trends in planktonic and tychoplanktonic diatoms broadly reflect both long-term climatic changes associated with the demise of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and abrupt climatic changes associated with, for example, the Younger Dryas stadial. Indeed, diatom communities are most different before and after the boundary between the Early and Middle Holocene periods of ca. 8.2 cal kyr BP, associated with the presence and demise of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets respectively. Diatom richness and diversity, estimated using Hill's species numbers, are also shown to be very responsive to periods characterized by abrupt climate change, and using knowledge of diatom autecologies in Lake Baikal, diversity trends are interpreted in terms of resource availability. Using diatom biovolume accumulation rates (BVARs; mu m(3) cm(-2) yr(-1)), we show that spring diatom crops dominate palaeoproductivity for nearly all of our record, apart from a short period during the Late Holocene, when autumnal productivity dominated between 1.8-1.4 cal kyr BP. Palaeoproductivity was especially unstable during the Younger Dryas, reaching peak rates of 18.3 x 10(3) mu m(3) cm(-2) yr(-1) at ca. 12.3 cal kyr BP. Generalized additive models (GAMs), which explore productivity-diversity relationships (PDRs) during pre-defined climate periods, reveal complex relationships. The strongest statistical evidence for GAMs were found during the Younger Dryas, the Early Holocene, and the Late Holocene, i.e. periods of rapid climate change. We account for these differences in terms of climate-mediated resource availability, and the ability of endemic diatom species in Lake Baikal to adapt to extreme forms of living in this unique ecosystem. Our analyses offer insight into how productivity-diversity relationships may develop in the future under a warming climate.

However, details process in spatial and temporal changes are still debated. We use the schizothoracines as a palaeoclimatic proxy to test two hypotheses concerning the evolution of Quaternary glaciations and lakes of the Changtang Plateau: (1) the Tibetan glaciations generally tended to decrease since the middle Pleistocene; (2) the lakes expansion was driven by summer monsoon rainfall. Based on a wide range-wide sampling throughout in the Changtang Plateau and its adjacent drainages, we constructed phylogeny and demographic histories of schizothoracines in the Changtang Plateau. Our results showed that the populations of the exorheic rivers and lakes in southern Tibet possessed higher genetic variability, earlier coalescent and expansion times than those of the endorheic lakes in the Changtang Plateau. Population expansions are highly consistent with phases of strong summer monsoon and high lake level during interglacial stages. The maximum growth rate intervals showed three pulses from 64.7 to 54.8, 39.6 to 31.0, and 14.9 to 2.4kya respectively. The significant positive correlations were found between regional precipitation and genetic diversity, as well as coalescence time of populations in the endorheic lakes. We suggested that the demographic history of the schizothoracines reflects the spatial and temporal changes in climate and lake level, in particular, in regional precipitation gradients associated with changes of the South Asian monsoon, and supports the climatic hypothesis of a general diminishing tend in Tibetan glaciations in the Tibetan Plateau since the middle Pleistocene.					; Chen, Yifeng/HNP-8915-2023; Liu, Chunlong/AAB-6989-2020	Liu, Chunlong/0000-0002-3376-4555; HE, DEKUI/0000-0002-4001-826X; 													2045-7758					FEB	2016	6	3					656	674		10.1002/ece3.1890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1890								26865956					WOS:000369974900003

KANN were applied to map the relationships between physical, chemical and biological time-series data of the two adjacent lakes. An expected outcome of this study was to determine improvements in water quality and changed dominance of phytoplankton populations in both lakes in relation to the consecutive implementation of external phosphorus control and food web manipulation. The lakes were considered as hyper-eutrophic and have been managed both with bottom-up and top-down management approaches. These control measures include: (1) reduction of external phosphate loadings by a sewage treatment plant, (2) lake flushing during winter in 1979 and during summer in 1985, and (3) biomanipulation in Lake Wolderwijd in 1991 and commercial fishing in Lake Veluwemeer from 1992-1994. The three eutrophication control measures aimed at reduced PO4-P concentrations and the prevention of blooms of the filamentous blue-green algae Oscillatoria agardhii. Results using nutrients, pH and secchi depths ranges, have demonstrated that KANN allow to elucidate the complex ecological processes of the alternate stable states (turbid versus clear water conditions) in both lakes. The results have shown similar patterns of abundances within (1) the phytoplankton functional groups; diatom, green algae and blue-green algae (2) the specific genus, Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus, possibly the combination of external nutrient control and in-lake food web manipulation of the two lakes achieved to control eutrophication. When applied to complex ecological data KANN provided a realistic image of the changes in Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus abundances and assemblages of diatoms, green algae and blue-green algae during clear-water and turbid-phase dynamics in relation to pH, Secchi depths, nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Oscillatoria and blue-green algae are dominant during turbid phase, with high pHs and N-limitation while green algae and diatoms predominate under clear-water conditions of low pHs and with P-limitation. Scenedesmus were mostly abundant under clear-water conditions specified by the ranges. The results from this study support the assumption that top-down food web manipulation can efficiently complement the primary eutrophication control of decreasing external phosphorus loads.

Warming enhances sedimentation and decomposition of organic carbon in shallow macrophyte-dominated systems with zero net effect on carbon burial	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Temperatures have been rising throughout recent decades and are predicted to rise further in the coming century. Global warming affects carbon cycling in freshwater ecosystems, which both emit and bury substantial amounts of carbon on a global scale. Currently, most studies focus on the effect of warming on overall carbon emissions from freshwater ecosystems, while net effects on carbon budgets may strongly depend on burial in sediments. Here, we tested whether year-round warming increases the production, sedimentation, or decomposition of particulate organic carbon and eventually alters the carbon burial in a typical shallow freshwater system. We performed an indoor experiment in eight mesocosms dominated by the common submerged aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum testing two temperature treatments: a temperate seasonal temperature control and a warmed (+4 degrees C) treatment (n = 4). During a full experimental year, the carbon stock in plant biomass, dissolved organic carbon in the water column, sedimented organic matter, and decomposition of plant detritus were measured. Our results showed that year-round warming nearly doubled the final carbon stock in plant biomass from 6.9 +/- 1.1 g C in the control treatment to 12.8 +/- 0.6 g C (mean +/- SE), mainly due to a prolonged growing season in autumn. DOC concentrations did not differ between the treatments, but organic carbon sedimentation increased by 60% from 96 +/- 9.6 to 152 +/- 16 g Cm-2 yaer(-1) (mean +/- SE) from control to warm treatments. Enhanced decomposition of plant detritus in the warm treatment, however, compensated for the increased sedimentation. As a result, net carbon burial was 40 +/- 5.7 g Cm-2 year(-1) in both temperature treatments when fluxes were combined into a carbon budget model. These results indicate that warming can increase the turnover of organic carbon in shallow macrophyte-dominated systems, while not necessarily affecting net carbon burial on a system scale.

THE INVASIVE SPECIES PSEUDORAZBORA PARVA (TELEOSTEI, CYPRINIDAE) IN THE ECOSYSTEM OF LAKE BAZALETY	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												In fresh waters of the ecosystems of eastern Georgia, Amur Pseudorazbora parva is widespread. This is an undemanding species; it is distinguished by the active adaptation to different environmental conditions. Therefore, Amur Pseudorasbora parva successfully competes with other species, including marketable fishes. The Amur Pseudorazbora parva food consists of animal (animal plankton, zoobenthos) and plant organisms (phytoplankton, periphyton) and organic detritus as well. In summer periods, the main diet of this fish is animal organisms. Based on the results obtained, Amur Pseudorasbora parva can be considered as an alternative to Gambusia for the struggle against Anopheles mosquito in humid regions of Western Georgia.																			0044-5134					OCT	2011	90	10					1277	1280																WOS:000297530300016
J	Reitner, B; Herndl, GJ; Herzig, A				Reitner, B; Herndl, GJ; Herzig, A			Role of ultraviolet-B radiation on photochemical and microbial oxygen consumption in a humic-rich shallow lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In a humic-rich, shallow lake (Lake Neusiedl), the seasonal dynamics of the humic and the nonhumic dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were investigated and the photochemical oxygen consumption rates of these DOC fractions exposed to surface solar radiation levels were compared with that of the bulk DOC and bacterial respiration, Furthermore, bacterial utilization of the humic, nonhumic, and bulk DOC pre-exposed to solar radiation was compared with utilization of the different fractions of DOC held in the dark prior to inoculating natural bacterial assemblages. The concentration of the unfractionated DOC pool ranged from similar to 3 mmol C liter(-1) during summer to 1.3 mmol C liter(-1) in late spring. The mean contribution of humic DOC was 35.2% of bulk DOG. Under the full spectrum of solar radiation, photochemical oxygen consumption of the unfractionated DOC was 3.3 mu mol O-2 liter(-1) h(-1), 1.8 mu mol O-2 liter(-1) h(-1) of the humic DOG, and 1.7 mu mol O-2 liter(-1) h(-1) of the nonhumic DOG. In the absence of UVB, photochemical oxygen consumption was reduced by 35% in the unfractionated DOG, 38% in the humic, and 27.5% in the nonhumic DOG. Under the full, spectrum of solar radiation, the photochemical oxygen consumption normalized to DOC was more than twice as high (2.83 mu mol O-2 mmol(-1) C h(-1)) for humic than for nonhumic DOG. The bacterial oxygen consumption rate was similar to 30% of the photochemical oxygen consumption of the unfractionated DOG. In batch culture experiments with natural bacterial assemblages as inocula, the bacterial yield was generally higher with substrate exposed to the full spectrum of solar radiation than with substrate held in the dark prior to inoculation. Exposure of 0.8-mu m filtered water to the full spectrum of surface solar radiation for 2-3 h resulted in a decline in activity (measured by thymidine incorporation) to 47% of the activity measured in the dark, If UVB was excluded, bacterial activity was 62% of that in the dark. Subsequent incubation at 5-20-cm depth under in situ radiation for another 2-3 h resulted in bacterial activity similar to that detected in the dark incubations at the surface, Bacteria exposed to the full range of solar radiation at the surface and incubated subsequently in the dark exhibited significantly lower activity than bacteria exposed to in situ solar radiation in distinct depth layers. This result indicates that bacteria rapidly recover from previous UV stress in the absence of UVB, Based on our results, we estimate that the photooxidation-mediated residence times in the top 5-cm layer of the water column are 90 and 45.5 d for the nonhumic and humic fractions and 75 d for unfractionated DOG. For the entire water column, similar to 10% of the remineralization activity (bacterial respiration + photochemical oxygen consumption) is due to photooxidation of the DOC, and the mean residence time of DOC is similar to 80 d.

A multi-proxy reconstruction of environmental change spanning the last 37,000 years from Burial Lake, Arctic Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment cores from Burial Lake located in the western Brooks Range in Arctic Alaska record paleoenvironmental changes that span the last 37,000 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). We identified four distinct lithologic subunits based on physical properties (dry bulk density, magnetic susceptibility), sediment composition, and geochemical proxies (organic matter, biogenic silica, C/N, organic matter delta C-13 and delta N-15, and elemental data from scanning X-ray fluorescence). The multi-proxy approach and relatively high temporal resolution (at multi-decadal to centennial time scales) of our proxy analysis, compared with previous studies of intermediate water depth cores from Burial Lake, provide new insights into the paleoenvironmental history of the region spanning the period prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Relatively high lake-levels and gradually decreasing in-lake and terrestrial productivity occur during the mid-Wisconsin interstadial from 37,200 to 29,600 cal yr BP. The subsequent period is defined by falling and lower lake-levels with decreasing effective-moisture, windier conditions, and sustained low aquatic productivity throughout the LGM between 29,600 and 19,600 cal yr BP. The last deglaciation that commenced by 19,600 cal yr BP is characterized by gradual changes in several sediment physical and geochemical proxies, including increasing C/N ratios and terrestrial productivity, decreasing magnetic susceptibility and clastic sediment flux, along with rising and relatively higher lake-levels. A decrease in aeolian activity after 16,500 cal yr BP is inferred from the appearance of fine (very fine sandy silt) sediment, compared to coarse sediments through the LGM and last deglaciation. The highest levels of terrestrial inputs along with increasing and variable aquatic productivity occur during the Lateglacial to early Holocene interval between 16,500 and 8800 cal yr BP. The absence of multi-proxy evidence for a strong climatic reversal during the Younger Dryas from Burial Lake sediments contrasts with some paleorecords showing cooler temperatures and/or dry conditions in northern Alaska at this time. Peak levels of sediment organic content and terrestrial productivity at Burial Lake between 10,500 and 9900 cal yr BP coincide with the early Holocene summer insolation maxima, which likely represents summertime warming and an enhanced flux of watershed derived organic matter from permafrost degradation. The remainder of the Holocene (since 8800 cal yr BP) at Burial Lake is characterized by relatively high and stable lake levels, landscape stabilization, and relatively high and variable levels of aquatic productivity.

A group of six solid natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) was tested along with compositions in which these NADESs were combined with powdered cork. All compounds were used as sorbents in TF-SPME for the first time. The NADES containing betaine chloride (BeCl) and 1-eicosanol (EiOH) at a 1:3 molar ratio mixed with powdered cork was finally selected to coat Teflon (R) mesh. Several factors (pH of samples, mass of sorbent, time of extraction and desorption) were tested using the central composite design in order to select the optimal TF-SPME conditions. Limits of detection ranged from 0.06 to 0.10 ng mL-1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for single sorbent repeatability were lower than 4.6 % (intra-day) and lower than 7.4 % (inter-day), while sorbent to sorbent reproducibility was lower than 8.7 %. Ultraviolet filters were not determined initially in four environmental lake water samples (with summer and winter sampling), however they were determined with good extraction recoveries after spiking the samples (in range of 84-92 % when spiked with 5 ng mL-1 and in range of 86-95 % when spiked with 50 ng mL-1). The proposed composition of NADES [BeCl:EiOH(1:3)] and cork at a 15:1 mass ratio exhibits good stability on Teflon (R) mesh as well as in water and organic solvents which enabled effective extractions for at least 10 cycles. The sustainability and green aspects of the proposed method with NADES/cork composite were analysed using the ComplexMoGAPI tool and established at 85 out of 100. The method exemplifies exceptional innovation by employing natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) and cork as sustainable sorbents in TF-SPME - it adheres to green analytical chemistry principles and addresses the critical needs for monitoring ultraviolet filters in water, which is crucial for assessing pollution and environmental health.

The results show that specific nature of Lake Cerknica influences the extent of the pollution. When regular gradual changes in water level occur the pollution effects can be buffered. The consequence of immediate decrease of water level is severe pollution of the main flow. The springs of the carstic tributaries are already loaded with pollutants which are transferred through underground pathways from neighbouring regions.

Monitoring of muskrat abundance is therefore an important task for wildlife managers, but traditional methods such as house counts conducted during ground-based surveys can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Poor conditions or a lack of access may limit how much of a wetland can be surveyed. Aerial imagery has previously been used to census a diverse array of wildlife populations but is not yet a common tool for muskrat surveys. To investigate the accuracy of this alternative survey method, we collected aerial imagery from coastal wetlands along the north shore of Lake Ontario during the winter of 2014 for examination in both 2D orthorectified and 3D stereoscopic formats. We compared muskrat house counts obtained from imagery to counts recorded by ground survey crews in the same wetlands during the same winter. We found no significant difference between mean muskrat house counts obtained by ground survey crews and orthoimagery observers. In contrast, stereoscopic imagery observers overestimated mean house counts compared to ground survey crews, which we interpret was due to an increase in false positives. Our results indicate that orthoimagery is a promising tool for assessing muskrat occupancy, provides comparable broad-scale results to traditional ground survey methods, and may be preferable to wildlife managers for a variety of reasons.

P,p'-DDE has been shown to cause severe reproductive failures and population declines in birds of prey. However, there are knowledge gaps regarding OC exposure for some species (e.g. harriers), the historical record and the broader picture. The main goal was to evaluate exposure to p,p'-DDE and PCBs in two raptor species: Montagu's and pallid harriers (Circus pygargus and Circus macrourus), and to investigate if birds from different breeding areas and wintering grounds differ in pollutant levels. For this purpose, we collected blood of adult and nestling Montagu's and pallid harriers breeding in the natural steppes of Kazakhstan, and adult and nestling Montagu's harriers breeding in agricultural and natural habitats of Spain, in 2007-2008. We determined the blood concentrations of p,p'-DDE and PCBs. Adult harriers generally showed higher concentrations of p,p'-DDE and PCBs than nestlings, probably because they had more time for a progressive accumulation of these compounds due to a higher intake than excretion rate. The p,p'-DDE concentrations in adults were equivalent in all the studied areas. The ratio p,p'-DDE/PCB 153 was higher in adults than in nestlings, suggesting that a portion of the p,p'-DDE in adult harriers may have come from p,p'-DDT applied in the past in the wintering areas. Overall, the concentrations of p,p'-DDE and Sigma PCBs reported were generally low and below any demonstrated threshold of harm. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From 1988-1993, a condition referred to as 'swollen yolk-sac syndrome' (SYSS) accounted for increasingly significant mortalities of Murray cod eggs and newly hatched larvae, often resulting in total mortality of eggs and larvae during incubation and larval rearing stages. SYSS appears to be similar to the well known 'blue-sac disease' (BSD) in salmonids but without the 'bluish tinge' coloration of the serous fluid in the yolk-sac attributed to BSD. Early investigations ruled out that SYSS condition was caused by a pathogen, viral, bacterial or a parasitic protozoan, and this led to the subsequent investigations on the possible nutritionally related causes of the syndrome, which are reported here. The eggs of normal and SYSS spawns differed in many respects; the latter were lighter and had less moisture (P < 0.05), but did not differ in the amount of protein and/or lipid content per egg. The free amino acid (FAA) content of the two types of eggs were different however, when all the essential amino acids (EAA) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA) of the FAA pool were found in significantly lower amounts (nmol/egg) in SYSS eggs (EAA-11.84 +/- 0.0.90; NEAA-10.68 +/- 0.66) compared to normal eggs (EAA-21.67 +/- 1.M; NEAA-16.64 +/- 1.26). On the other hand, the differences in the total amino acid (TAA = protein bound + free) content and the fatty acid content of the egg types were relatively minor. It was also observed that broodstock, the spawns of which manifested SYSS, when allowed to forage in a relatively large pond, with ample natural food sources, for a period of time, their subsequent spawns tended to be normal. In eggs and larvae of spawns of such rehabilitated females, the amount of individual amino acids of the FAA pool was intermediate to that of normal and SYSS. All evidence appears to indicate that the SYSS syndrome in Murray cod is related to broodstock nutrition, possibly a result of cumulative effects of dietary deficiencies over time.

J	DUTHIE, HC				DUTHIE, HC			LIMNOLOGY OF SUB-ARCTIC CANADIAN LAKES AND SOME EFFECTS OF IMPOUNDMENT	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The subarctic zone in Canada, extending between the polar tree limit and the economical forest line to the south, includes a large portion of the Precambrian Shield lake district. Hydroelectric and other energy-related developments have provided the impetus for several recent studies on subarctic lakes. There is considerable variation in thermal regimes, but in general the ice-free season is 90 to 120 days and summer thermal stratification is strongly developed only in smaller lakes or sheltered bays. Light penetration is often severely limited by humic materials. Chemically, the main division is between the very dilute waters of the Precambrian Shield and the ionically richer off-Shield waters. Of 620 taxa of algae found in and around western Labrador lakes about 400 are planktonic, and many of these plankters are small decliate flagellates. Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae are the best represented classes. The most widespread species in subarctic lakes is the chrysophyte Dinobryon bavaricum, followed by several diatoms such as Melosira islandica, Asterionella formosa, Cyclotella glomerata and Rhizosolenia eriensis. Large lakes show a seasonal unimodal phytoplankton maximum of generally under 500 mg m-3 in late summer and consisting mainly of diatoms; in smaller lakes the seasonal maximum is less well defined or nonexistent and Chrysophyceae are relatively more important. Primary production in subarctic Labrador lakes ranges between 8 and 16 g C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr. In shallow lakes there is probably a significant contribution from periphyton production. Heterotrophic production may be significant in subarctic lakes; in Labrador lakes heterotrophically fixed C contributs 18-27% of the phytoplankton primary production. The impact of flooding on some physical and chemical parameters in the formation of Smallwood Reservoir, Labrador, is summarized. Both phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity at first declined when the reservoir was filling, then later increased over preimpoundment values. Zooplankton populations, especially of particulate feeders such as Diaptomus minutus and Bosmina coregoni, showed a marked increase. A simple model is described, based mainly on P dynamics, which enables the magnitude and duration of the phases of reservoir development to be predicted before impoundment.																			0004-0851						1979	11	2					145	158		10.2307/1550642	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550642													WOS:A1979GZ75800003

Some recent studies have highlighted the escalating human activities in the late Holocene, which could potentially pose significant challenges to the precise quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimate. In this study, we undertake a quantitative reconstruction of Holocene climate and human influence index (HII) based on pollen data from the Shiwangutian (SWGT) in Southern China. This is achieved by developing and applying a pollen-based calibration model utilizing Locally Weighted Average-Partial Least Squares Regression (LWWA-PLS) and the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT). Our findings reveal that evergreen forests experienced expansion between 11.6 and 9.0 cal ka BP, coinciding with elevated Mean Annual Precipitation (Map) and Mean Annual Temperature (Mat) levels. These patterns signify a progressively warm and wet climate during this period. Subsequently, evergreen forests achieved their maximum abundance between 9.0 and 4.0 cal ka BP, aligning with a notable increase in vegetation richness, indicating a warmer and wetter climate during the midHolocene. Notably, during the interval of 6.0-4.0 cal ka BP, the Map, Mat, and Precipitation of Warmest Month (Mpwa) reached the Holocene optimum, approximately 14% higher than modern. Consequently, we deduce that in the early and middle Holocene, when the monsoon was particularly strong, synchronous changes in precipitation fostered the regional expansion of evergreen broad-leaved forests. Furthermore, the record demonstrates a substantial reduction in forest cover and a noteworthy increase in the HII value since 4.0 cal ka BP, likely attributable to anthropogenic impacts. Our analysis suggests that the influence of anthropogenic activities surpassed that of natural climate factors in shaping regional vegetation cover. These findings offer insights into potential drivers of climate change. As a preliminary conclusion, we propose that the summer insolation, ice sheets, and meltwater fluxes were the primary controlling factors for climate variations during the early to midHolocene in Southern China.

The technique is especially applicable to studies which focus on the distribution, geometry and quantification of geological bodies including the analysis of sedimentary forms and tectonic structures. This photogrammetric method allows for generating virtual outcrops (VO) and high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs). In comparison with more sophisticated and expensive techniques such as airborne LiDAR scanning or terrestrial laser scanning, SfM-MVS is a fast low-cost method which with careful use of ground control points, can produce models which are comparable to other digital survey methods for spatial accuracy. In this study, the effectiveness of SfM-MVS in a series of quantitative case studies in sedimentary and basin analyses is discussed. Focus is placed on how the research questions define the workflow strategy to know the limitations, sources of error and potential utility that the SFM-MVS technique has when a virtual sedimentary system is interpreted. Three case studies of different sedimentary environments, previously analyzed with traditional fieldwork techniques, were selected and re-analyzed. For each case study the objective was to resolve quantitative questions that were not possible to determine without the use of VO or DTMs. Questions include: (i) geometrical restoration of a growth strata succession associated with thrust systems; (ii) stacking patterns of littoral ridges during a relative sea-level fall after the Holocene climatic optimum; and (iii) quantification of lake level fall during the past 44 years of a closed lake basin. The results of the work show that the technique has significant application in the analysis of sedimentary systems. However, since geological interpretations depend on the quality of the models that are generated, planning and construction of the VO or DEMs along with their validation are essential to ensure reliable results.

J	Hanson, SD; Curry, RA				Hanson, SD; Curry, RA			Effects of size structure on trophic interactions between age-0 smallmouth bass and juvenile anadromous alewives	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Age-0 alewives Alosa pseudoharengus may compete for food with age-0 smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, possibly resulting in declines to some smallmouth bass fisheries in the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada. Such competition could dramatically influence the recruitment of smallmouth bass in this region because they are at their northern limit of distribution and age-0 smallmouth bass must accumulate sufficient lipid reserves to survive the overwinter period. We examined the temporal patterns of diet and isotopes of carbon and nitrogen for age-0 alewives and smallmouth bass in a natural lake and a reservoir where alewife escapement is managed. Multiple alewife spawnings occurred in the lake, and small-bodied alewives were abundant throughout the summer. There was minimal diet overlap, age-0 alewives became a significant component of the age-0 smallmouth bass diet, and age-0 bass grew larger in this system. In the reservoir, escapement of alewife spawners was truncated, and a single-size age-0 cohort was observed. Alewives were similar in size to age-0 smallmouth bass, and by late summer their diets showed some overlap and δC-13 and δN-15 levels were similar. Both predation and the potential for competition existed for these species, and their interactions depended on body size relationships. This is an important consideration in alewife management strategies where coexisting fisheries for smallmouth bass are desired.					Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020	Curry, R.

High-resolution multi-proxy analysis of a robust accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dated lacustrine sediment core recovered from Jingpo Lake in Northeastern China provides a detailed history of EASM variability and vegetation changes since similar to 5100cal. yr BP. The period from similar to 5100 to 3600cal. yr BP was characterized by the highest pollen percentages of Quercus, Ulmus, Juglans and Corylopsis; low Md (median grain size diameter); and high C-13(org) values, reflecting a relatively warm and humid period. The period between similar to 3600 and 2100cal. yr BP is characterized by high Md and low C-13(org) values, and a rapid increase in pollen percentages of herbs, indicating cool and dry climatic conditions. From similar to 2100 to 150cal. yr BP, a gradual increase in C-13(org) values and low Md values, and a rapid increase in Carpinus, Juglans and Corylopsis pollen percentages was observed, indicating climate change towards warmer and wetter conditions. After similar to 150cal. yr BP, the highest values of total organic carbon mass accumulation rate (TOC-MAR), total nitrogen mass accumulation rate (TN-MAR) and magnetic susceptibility suggesting that the Jingpo Lake region has been severely affected by human activities. The EASM variability in Northeastern China during the mid- to late Holocene shows trends similar to EASM records in China. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the variability of the EASM during the mid- to late Holocene on the multi-decadal to centennial scale was forced by changes in both solar output and oceanic-atmospheric circulation interaction.					; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; Ji, ming/NDS-9964-2025; Li, Chenzhong/F-5087-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Li, Chunhai/0000-0002-6529-6653; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2015	25	3					454	468		10.1177/0959683614561888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614561888													WOS:000349531500005

However, little is known about the effects of introduced biocontrol agents on these processes. This study examined the effects of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) and its biocontrol agent, the alligator weed flea beetle (Agasicles hygrophila), on nutrient cycling in a northern New Zealand lake. Alligator weed litter decomposed significantly faster than either of two native sedge species (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Isolepis prolifer) in a litterbag experiment. In addition, the presence of the alligator weed flea beetle resulted in large amounts of decaying alligator weed litter entering the lake in early summer. Both the timing and magnitude of this litter input were uncharacteristic of seasonal biomass dynamics of the native sedges. Combined with alligator weed's rapid decomposition, this indicates altered patterns of nutrient cycling at the lake, with potential flow-on effects including facilitation of further weed invasion.

They were used to fit BEVERTON & HOLT (1957), RICKER(1954, 1980), and SHEPHERD (1982) stock-recruitment models. The brat fitting was obtained with a Shepherd dome-shaped stock-recruitment curve. It explained 41 % of the variability of the recruitment index. The dome-shaped stock-recruitment model was confirmed by the results of a nonparametric regression method (ACE: Alternating Conditional Expectations). Ln order to demonstrate the effect of factors other than stock, a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed using residuals from the SHEPHERD stock-recruitment model as the dependent variable, and stocking, perch catches, sums of degree-days above 8 degrees C for the whole year and in spring, and sum of degree-days above 0 degrees C in January and February as the explanatory variables. The sum of degree-days above 8 degrees C in spring and the sum of degree-days above 0 degrees C in January and February were selected. They explained 22 % of the variability of the residuals. The use of the ACE method did not highlight interpretable nonlinear transformations for the other factors. Stock appeared to be the main factor influencing cohort strength. Therefore, we hypothesized that stock controls recruitment through cannibalism. The temperature during egg incubation and larvae development had also an effect on recruitment fur a given stock level.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						197	206																WOS:000078180200020

Three dominant MB morphotypes were observed to occur within the chemocline. Small microaerophilic magnetite-producing cocci were present at the top of the chemocline, while a greigite-producing packet-forming bacterium occurred at the base of the chemocline. The distributions of these groups displayed sharp changes in abundance over small length scales within the water column as well as strong seasonal fluctuations in population abundance. We identified a novel, greigite-producing rod in the sulfidic hypolimnion that was present in relatively constant abundance over the course of the season. This rod is the first MB that appears to belong to the gamma-Proteobacteria, which may suggest an iron-rather than sulfur-based respiratory metabolism. Its distribution and phylogenetic identity suggest that an alternative model for the ecological and physiological role of magnetotaxis is needed for greigite-producing MB.

J	BERTRAM, DF; LEGGETT, WC				BERTRAM, DF; LEGGETT, WC			PREDATION RISK DURING THE EARLY-LIFE HISTORY PERIODS OF FISHES - SEPARATING THE EFFECTS OF SIZE AND AGE	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We compared predation risk for fish which differed in age at metamorphosis but not in length, and for those which differed in length at metamorphosis but not in age, using laboratory-reared winter flounder Pleuronectes americanus. Pairs of fish were offered to individual predatory shrimp Crangon septemspinosa as prey in a series of laboratory predation trials. In the size experiments, prey length differed on average by 0.5 mm (8%), but age was identical. We could not detect a difference in the number of captures of 'small' and 'large' individuals in 104 trials where only 1 prey was consumed. In the age experiments, prey age differed by 9 d (18% on average), but length was virtually identical. We could not detect a difference in the number of captures of 'young' and 'old' metamorphosing individuals in 56 trials where only 1 prey was consumed. Moreover, time until capture did not vary with increasing age at metamorphosis over a range of 35+ d. These results suggest that any differences in predation risk between fish which exhibit the range of ages and sizes at metamorphosis represented in our experiments are subtle and are potentially ecologically inconsequential. This work, combined with that of others, questions the validity of the inference that, for marine fishes, individuals which are large-at-age have a survival advantage during the early life history periods.

High-resolution magnetic susceptibility profiling delineates similar sequences of tephra layers in several l-m-long lake sediment cores. Electron microprobe analyses of glass shards from the tephras indicate correlation of some ash layers with known reference tephras from the source volcanoes, while other ash layers record previously unknown prehistoric eruptions. Skilak Lake cores contain ash from the historic 1912 Katmai eruption, the 1902 Redoubt eruption, and the 1883 Mount St. Augustine eruption as well as prehistoric ash layers erupted from Crater Peak at Mt. Spurr ca. 250-350 years ago, from Redoubt Volcano at ca. 300-400 years ago and again at ca. 350-450 years ago, and a 500-year-old ash from Mount St. Augustine. Still older tephras from Redoubt Volcano and Crater Peak at Mt. Spurr are found lower in the cores. The cores indicate that volcanoes in the Cook Inlet area have erupted every 10-35 years during the 20th century, and ash falls have occurred at Skilak Lake at least once every 50-100 years for the last 500 years, with Redoubt, Spurr, and Augustine Volcanoes being the most important sources of tephra.																			0377-0273					AUG	1994	62	1-4					55	67		10.1016/0377-0273(94)90028-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(94)90028-0													WOS:A1994PH19800005

Here we use AMS C-14 dating and analyses of grain-size and major element contents, and the results show that: (1) During 11.5-10.0 cal kyr BP, the geochemical climate change index (C) (1.16), sediment accumulation rate (SAR) (0.007 cm/yr) and median particle diameter (Md) (20.6 mu m) are the lowest within the section, while the geochemical drought index (0.0323), Fe/Mn ratio (0.0088) and clay content (17.3%) are the highest, which indicate that the North China Plain received less precipitation, and chemical weathering and erosional intensity in the Ningjinpo paleolake catchment were weak. (2) During 10.0-7.7 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.36), content of sand (19.1%) and silt (68.0%), Md (27.2 mu m) and SAR (0.019 cm/yr) increase significantly. These characteristics indicate that the climate gradually became wetter, chemical weathering and erosion intensity increased, and there was increased runoff to the lake, which raised the lake level. (3) During 7.7-5.5 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.56), silt content (71.8%) and SAR (0.030 cm/yr) increase to the highest, while the Fe/Mn ratio (0.0068), sand content (14.4%) and Md (21.4 mu m) decrease to their lowest levels. These suggest the climate was warm and humid, the runoff to the lake was large, chemical weathering in the catchment was strong, and the water level of the lake reached the maximum for the Holocene. (4) During 5.5-3.3 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.26) and SAR (0.011 cm/yr) decrease substantially, whereas the sand content (28.2%) and M-d (18.3 mu m) increase to the highest levels. These characteristics demonstrate that the climate gradually became arid, the runoff to Ningjinpo paleolake was reduced, the intensity of chemical weathering and erosion in the catchment weakened, and the lake level decreased, although the high frequency of floods in this period. (5) In addition to the globally-recorded abrupt climatic events at similar to 8.2 cal kyr BP, similar to 5.3 cal kyr BP and similar to 4.2 cal kyr BP, which were recorded in the northern monsoon region of China, an abrupt climatic event in the middle Holocene, at similar to 7.2 cal kyr BP, was also recorded. In the northern monsoon region of China, these events may have been amplified by unusually active ENSO since the middle Holocene.

J	Stoll, JMA; Ulrich, MM; Giger, W				Stoll, JMA; Ulrich, MM; Giger, W			Dynamic behavior of fluorescent whitening agents in Greifensee: Field measurements combined with mathematical modeling of sedimentation and photolysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The dynamic behavior of the two fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) that are currently used in laundry detergents in Switzerland (DAS 1, a diaminostilbene, and DSBP, a distyrylbiphenyl) has been evaluated quantitatively during 1 year for Greifensee, a small lake in Switzerland, by using a one-box model and simulation software (MASAS) for modeling organic pollutants in lakes. Both the one-box model and the one-dimensional simulation were based on (i) independently evaluated processes affecting the fate of FWAs and (ii) measured FWA concentrations in the lake. The relevant processes were derived from literature data and from measurements in the lake and in its tributaries. Besides loading from tributaries, only photodegradation (responsible for 53% and 81% of the elimination of DAS 1 and DSBP, respectively), sorption/sedimentation (20% and 9%), and flushing (27% and 10%) were found to be relevant for FWAs in Greifensee. In particular, no evidence was found for other degradation processes such as biodegradation or hydrolysis. During 1 year, concentration depth profiles were measured above the deepest point of the lake in intervals of 4 weeks. The measured RNA concentrations were between 50 and 120 ng L-1 (DAS 1) and between 10 and 110 ng L-1 (DSBP), with maximum Values in the thermocline during summer. Evidence was found that these maximum Values originated from subsurface loading occurring in summer at levels of 4-8 m depth. This study is one of the first field validations for photochemical degradation rates measured in the laboratory.

These same lakes show indications of nitrogen limitation: (1) blue-green algae are relatively important in summer (7 to 88% of total biomass) and a large proportion of the filaments contain heterocysts and (2) inorganic nitrogen levels are extremely low in the surface waters (NO2- + NO3- + NH4+ - N < 10 .mu.g l-1). In 1985 and 1986 inorganic mitrogen (25 to 1200 .mu.g l-1 - N) and/or phosphorus (12 to 100 .mu.g l-1 - P) was added to water in 31 m3 limnocorrals or 2 l bottles from four deep prairie lakes. In most cases, phytoplankton biomass (estimated as chlorophyll .alpha.) was stimulated only by phosphorus additions. However, for a short period (8 d) after an unusual storm, phytoplankton biomass was stimulated by nitrogen additions. After this storm, TP increased by up to 75% in the epilimnion of the study lakes whereas TN did not increase. The algae which increased in these experiments tended to be the dominant algae in the control vessels, which varied with the experiment and the lake. Thus, a large proportion of blue-green algae and low inorganic nitrogen levels are not indicative per se of nitrogen limitation in lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 22	1988	159	3					269	276		10.1007/BF00008240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008240													WOS:A1988M507100006

In this study, the occurrence and transport of the continuously released organophosphate esters (OPEs) was investigated together with physical and biochemical parameters throughout the water column in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary during the summer. Total dissolved and particulate OPEs showed great spatial heterogeneity, with mean concentrations of 550 +/- 280 ng/L in the estuary, 110 +/- 270 ng/L in the front/upwelling zone, and 410 +/- 450 ng/L in the continental shelf. OPE concentrations in the estuarine bottom waters were high due to massive terrestrial/sediment inputs. In contrast, the "surface enrichment and depth depletion" of OPEs in the continental shelf was closely related to seasonal stratification. Reduced OPE concentrations were observed in the frontal/upwelling zone due to isopycnal heaving. Frontal activity and upwelling induced phytoplankton blooms in the coastal regions, which jointly contributed to elevated OPEs beneath surface water with high phytoplankton aggregation. The OPEs mainly originated from wastewater treatment plant discharges, industrial pollution and consumer products. These OPEs generally posed a low ecological risk to aquatic lives, but their long-term effects cannot be ignored due to their continuous high production, usage and release. The environmental behavior and fate of anthropogenic contaminants, such as the continuously released organophosphate esters (OPEs), is complex in estuaries and coastal environments. In this study, the occurrence and transport of OPEs in the Changjiang River estuary was associated with different oceanographic processes, including fronts, upwelling and impacts of the biological pump. Dissolved and particulate OPEs varied greatly from the estuary to the coastal region. High OPE concentrations were found in turbid bottom waters of estuary, likely caused by massive sediment inputs. Due to summertime stratification, the OPEs showed high levels in surface seawater, but generally low concentrations in middle/bottom layers of the continental shelf. As for the transition zone between the estuary and continental shelf where fronts/upwelling coexisted, relatively low OPE concentrations were present through the water column, because of the heaving of (cleaner) bottom water masses. Relatively higher OPE concentrations were present just below the algae-rich surface water, probably caused by the settling of biogenic particles with OPEs attached. The observed OPEs were mainly from wastewater treatment plant discharges, industrial pollution and consumer products. The ecological risks posed by OPEs to aquatic life cannot be ignored due to the continuous exposure. Sediment inputs increased organophosphate ester (OPE) concentrations in turbid bottom watersThe biological pump strongly affected OPEs in frontal/upwelling and continental shelf regionsDischarge from wastewater treatment plants contributed more than 50% of OPEs in the Changjiang River estuary					; Lohmann, Rainer/B-1511-2008; MA, Yuxin/AAG-8630-2020	Lohmann, Rainer/0000-0001-8796-3229; zhang, jinghua/0000-0002-3989-502X; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC	2023	128	12							e2023JC020081	10.1029/2023JC020081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JC020081													WOS:001129298500001

Marine Isotope Stage 11c: An unusual interglacial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Notoriety of the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11c interglacial arises from its long duration, extending over two precessional cycles, high sea level, and persistence of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The strong climatic response is often considered paradoxical because it was attained under weak boreal summer insolation forcing, a function of an extended eccentricity minimum and of precession and obliquity being almost opposite in phase. Here, we trace the characteristics of MIS 11c and explore their most likely causes. MIS 11c was preceded by the largest Quaternary ice volume expansion of MIS 12, which ended with a long period of ice rafting and interhemispheric heat transfer. We suggest that the duration of MIS 12 and the size of ice sheets exceeded a critical threshold that triggered a deglaciation despite the weak insolation forcing. The weak forcing led to a slow but steady loss of ice volume, that was sufficient to allow ocean outgassing of CO2, but insufficient to raise sea level within a single precessional cycle. This gave rise to a prolonged interval with large residual ice sheets and high CO 2 concentrations that is unique in the last 800,000 years. The obliquity-precession antiphasing produced a weak boreal summer insolation minimum, skipping a glacial inception and leading to continued sea-level rise and high CO2 concentrations, sustained by carbonate compensation. Full interglacial conditions were achieved in the second precessional cycle, and the combined strength and length of the interglacial probably led to loss of some Greenland and Antarctic ice compared to other interglacials. While MIS 11c is highly unusual in many respects, these appear to be linked to each other through the very weak insolation forcing, which led to its extended duration, slow sea-level rise and stable CO2 concentrations through a cocktail of counteracting carbon cycle processes. Although some of these features are also encountered in other interglacials, their combination with strong interglacial intensity is unique to MIS 11c and this appears to be a function of the large MIS 12 ice sheets and the high CO2 concentrations from the beginning of the interglacial.

The interaction of N application and integrated soil fertility index on grain yield and N fertilizer use efficiency such as N recovery efficiency, soil N dependency rate, and N contribution rate of wheat was studied through 2-year in situ tests in Changshu County of the Taihu Lake region, China. The results indicated that there are desirable quantitative relationships among the assessment indices, N application level and integrated soil fertility index. The regression coefficients showed that the ratio of the relative contribution of soil fertility and N application level to wheat yield was 0.48:1, and their contribution ratios to fertilizer N utilization efficiencies were 1.10:1, 1.45:1 and 1.93:1, respectively. The effects of both soil fertility and N application level on yield and N recovery efficiency indicated that it is difficult to simultaneously improve yield and N recovery efficiency of wheat by improving soil fertility when attempting to maximize yield. Only by enhancing soil fertility, reducing the N application level and decreasing the maximum yield, can high levels of N recovery efficiency be achieved. For this study, a ratio of N application level decrement to integrated soil fertility increment greater than 0.89 was necessary to increase the N recovery efficiency to 55%. Under this optimal condition, the reduction in N application level was 16%, and the mean yield loss of wheat was only 8%.

J	Thackray, GD				Thackray, GD			Extensive early and middle Wisconsin glaciation on the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the variability of Pacific moisture delivery to the northwestern United States	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Large glaciers descended western valleys of the Olympic Mountains six times during the last (Wisconsin) glaciation, terminating in the Pacific coastal lowlands. The glaciers constructed extensive landforms and thick stratigraphic sequences, which commonly contain wood and other organic detritus. The organic material, coupled with stratigraphic data, provides a detailed radiocarbon chronology of late Pleistocene ice-margin fluctuations. The early Wisconsin Lyman Rapids advance, which terminated prior to ca. 54,000 C-14 yr B.P., represented the most extensive ice cover. Subsequent glacier expansions included the Hoh Oxbow 1 advance, which commenced between ca. 42,000 and 35,000 C-14 yr B.P.; the Hoh Oxbow 2 advance, ca. 30,800 to 26,300 C-14 yr B.P.; the Hoh Oxbow 3 advance, ca. 22,000-19,300 C-14 yr B.P.; the Twin Creeks 1 advance, 19,100-18,300 C-14 Yr B.P.; and the subsequent, undated Twin Creeks 2 advance. The Hoh Oxbow 2 advance represents the greatest ice extent of the last 50,000 yr, with the glacier extending 22 km further downvalley than during the Twin Creeks 1 advance, which is correlative with the global last glacial maximum. Local pollen data indicate intensified summer cooling during successive stadial events. Because ice extent was diminished during colder stadial events, precipitation-not summer temperature-influenced the magnitude of glaciation most strongly. Regional aridity, independently documented by extensive pollen evidence, limited ice extent during the last glacial maximum. The timing of glacier advances suggests causal links with North Atlantic Bond cycles and Heinrich events.

Within this region, the Nalenggele River Catchment is particularly notable for its rich supergene boron deposits and complete hydrological systems including hot springs, rivers, and salt lakes. This region serves as an ideal natural laboratory for studying the boron behavior during regional chemical weathering and migration processes, as well as for understanding boron ore-forming mechanisms in arid basins with alpine-cold environment. However, the sources of dissolved boron in the river and lake waters are still controversial. The relative hydrological and hydrochemical processes have not been quantitatively researched, hindering a comprehensive understanding of boron enriching processes. In this study, the geochemical compositions and boron isotopes of river waters and rock samples in the Nalenggele River Catchment were systematically analysed to understand the formation processes of dissolved boron in rivers and to quantify potential contributions. The results showed: (1) Chemical weathering plays an important role in the formation of dissolved boron in low-boron rivers (<1 mg/L), whereas the enriched boron in high-boron rivers is mainly derived from geothermal waters in the source areas. (2) Geothermal water inputs account for 86.2 % similar to 91.4 % of dissolved boron and lithium in the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Nalenggele River. During the tributary confluence, over 70 % of dissolved boron in the Nalenggele River is contributed by the Hongshui River. (3) Boron isotopes in water are effective for source identification but less reliable for quantitative assessment of boron enrichment processes in the Nalenggele River Catchment due to its fractionation-prone property. This study presents quantitative results of boron sources, contributions, and accumulations and gives an insight into constraints of boron isotope as a geochemical signature. It is expected to provide an enhanced understandings of boron migration, enrichment, and ore-forming processes within "hot spring - river - salt lake" systems of the Tibetan Plateau.																			0883-2927	1872-9134				OCT	2025	190								106507	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2025.106507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2025.106507		JUL 2025											WOS:001544128700001
J	Prudnikova, TN				Prudnikova, T. N.			Ancient Agrolandscapes of the Darkhat Basin (Northern Mongolia)	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												According to remote sensing (space image decoding), the Darkhat Basin of Northern Mongolia is a sparsely populated cattle-breeding territory, which was an area of developed agriculture in the past. Quite numerous land plots are recognized at the end spills of rivers flowing from its mountainous frame, lake and river terraces, floodplains, and deluvial-proluvial slopes, at absolute elevations from 1535 to 1700 meters a.s.l. or more. Among the wide soil range, here are fertile chernozems, chestnut, and dark chestnut soils. The geological position of the region and its confinement to the southwestern periphery of the Baikal rift contributed to both the formation of the basin and its modern seismic activity, manifestations of basaltoid volcanism, as well as the emergence of a "regional thermal anomaly" (Vilor et al., 2019). The basin also belongs to the Khubsugul Upper Riphean-Cambrian phosphorite-bearing basin, where deposits and numerous manifestations of phosphorites, the basis of mineral fertilizers, are known (Il'in, 1973). The long history of the formation of the relief of the Darkhat Basin led to the enrichment to a greater or lesser extent of its Quaternary deposits with phosphorus compounds useful for agricultural practices. Modern volcanism and continental rifting processes contributed to the emergence of thermal springs in this area; nitrogen baths, which are a kind of liquid nitrogen fertilizer, are known here (Mongol'skaya..., 1990). The combination of the following features: fertile soils, the thermal anomaly of the Baikal rift, and the presence of nitrogen thermal springs, as well as deposits and manifestations of phosphorites, products of their destruction, enriching the soil, contributed to the development of agriculture here. Manifestations of Cenozoic basaltoid volcanism, causing the presence of fertile volcanic ash, as well as processes of medieval volcanic activation (Arzhannikov et al., 2017), played a possible role in the development of agricultural practices on this territory. Social and political events are also important reasons. According to an earlier analysis of ancient agriculture in the arid territories of Central Asia (Prudnikova, 2020), its maximum development in the Darkhat Basin occurred in the early Middle Ages, a time attributed to the small climatic optimum.																			2079-0961	2079-0988				DEC	2024	14	4					496	506		10.1134/S2079096124700471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2079096124700471													WOS:001424964200002

Microplastics were extracted using density separation and wet oxidation method. The microplastics identification was done under a stereomicroscope, and their polymer compositions were characterized using an attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The average abundance of microplastics in water and sediment samples was 88 +/- 14.5 items/L and 5720 +/- 2580 items/kg, respectively. The dominant shape groups of microplastics in water were fiber (58.7%), irregular fragments (32.4%), and beads (8.7%) with dominant colors as transparent>black> yellow approximate to white>red>green>pink>blue. Similar distribution in sediments was found, i.e., fiber (61.2%), irregular fragments (28.4%), and beads (10.3%) with dominant colors as transparent>pink>white>red approximate to black>blue>brown> green approximate to yellow. The ATR- FTIR spectra of visible microplastics were identified to be polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), low density polyethylene (LDPE), nitrile, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), latex, and polyethylene terephthalate (PETE). In the study area, recreational activities, improper waste disposal, and runoff from catchment areas are the main reasons for the contamination of microplastics in the Lake. The pollution load can be minimized by taking measures such as creating awareness, promotion of ecotourism, and reducing plastic use.					; Younas, Farhan/AAE-3686-2020	Younas, Dr. Farhan/0000-0001-6422-3842; Taneez, Mehwish/0000-0001-8450-2224													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2022	194	7							511	10.1007/s10661-022-10171-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10171-z								35713715					WOS:000812502000003

Benthic nutrient fluxes in a eutrophic, polymictic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Sediment release rates of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH4) were determined seasonally at three sites (water depth 7, 14 and 20 m) in Lake Rotorua using in situ benthic chamber incubations. Rates of release of SRP ranged from 2.2 to 85.6 mg P m(-2) d(-1) stop and were largely independent of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Two phases of NH4 release were observed in the chamber incubations; high initial rates of up to 2,200 mg N m(-2) d(-1) in the first 12 h of deployment followed by lower rates of up to 270 mg N m(-2) d(-1) in the remaining 36 h of deployment. Releases of SRP and NH4 were highest in summer and at the deepest of the three sites. High organic matter supply rates to the sediments may be important for sustaining high rates of sediment nutrient release. A nutrient budget of Lake Rotorua indicates that internal nutrient sources derived from benthic fluxes are more important than external nutrient sources to the lake.

Benthic invertebrate surveys were conducted within different substratum size classes and macrophyte beds in the nearshore littoral shallows (< 1 m) and in the deeper offshore littoral (2-10 m) and profundal (> 10 m) zones of the lake. Samples were dominated by the chironomid midges Cricotopus ornatus and Tanypus grodhausi; the damselfly Enallagma clausum; and an oligochaete worm of the genus Monopylephorus. Midges showed distinct depth preferences, with Cricotopus found primarily in the shallow littoral, and Tanypus found in the lower littoral and profundal regions. Enallagma occurred throughout the littoral region but was reduced in abundance below 10 m. Cricotopus and Enallagma were most abundant on cobble rock substratum and macrophytes. Sand and small gravel substrata supported few invertebrates except oligochaetes, which were most common in shallow littoral areas. The extent of Ruppia beds was determined using hydroacoustic sounding and showed that these beds were most well-developed in a zone from 1.25 to 5 m depth. The estimated area of productive shallow littoral zone habitat at different lake levels showed that coverage was lowest near the current surface elevation. Rising lake levels would result in expansion of suitable habitat area, and while falling levels could also expand nearshore habitat, this would likely occur on areas of poorer substratum quality and under high salinities that may inhibit growth.					; Jellison, Robert/HGU-5525-2022	Herbst, David/0000-0002-7879-5902; Roberts, Scott/0000-0003-1544-626X; 													0018-8158					JAN	2013	700	1					61	72		10.1007/s10750-012-1219-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1219-5													WOS:000312073300006

In addition, the impacts on the ventilation of wind corridors from the 8 spatial landscape parameters were analyzed. The results indicated that LOC and LTCs have significant ventilation benefit and certain UHI mitigation benefit varying with season, day and night and weather, which were able to accelerate winds when wind speeds exceed 0.57 m/s and 0.75 m/s, respectively. The most important influencing parameters on the ventilation capability were frontal area index and roughness length. The multiyear average WsRs of the LOC and LTCs were 57% and 31% higher than that of the CUA, respectively. The UHI reduction did not occur along the whole corridor or throughout the whole day.

J	PRINS, HHT; IASON, GR				PRINS, HHT; IASON, GR			DANGEROUS LIONS AND NONCHALANT BUFFALO	BEHAVIOUR												1. Aspects of the influence of predation of the African buffalo Syncerus cafferi were studied in Lake Manyara National Park, northern Tanzania, from 1981 to 1985. 2. During the study period, predation by lions was the most important cause of death in buffalo but occasionally major epidemics, such as rinderpest, can be by far the most important cause of death. 3. A comparison of Manyara with four other areas in Africa shows that the Manyara buffalo ran the same level of risk as those in these other areas, and that in periods in which epidemics or drought conditions are absent it was normal that ultimately some 90% of the large herbivores fell victim to predation. 4. Juvenile mortality in females was higher than in males but adult mortality in females was lower than in males. Adult brain ran a much higher risk to be killed by lions (12.9% p.a.) than herd-living buffalo (4.4% p.a.); the latter category comprised cows and sub-adult bulls. 5. Risk of predation was highest near the ecotone between grasslands and structurally closed vegetations. Grasslands were as dangerous as woodlands and thickets, and only the mudflats were really safe. The chance to be killed fell steeply away from (potential) cover for lions. 6. Buffalo were more vigilant at night than during the day, peripheral animals more so than central ones.

The choice of feeding areas in buffalo was not dictated by predation risk alone.

J	Reimer, A; Landmann, G; Kempe, S				Reimer, Andreas; Landmann, Guenter; Kempe, Stephan			Lake Van, Eastern Anatolia, Hydrochemistry and History	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Saline, 450-m-deep Lake Van (Eastern Anatolia, Turkey) is, with 576 km(3), the third largest closed lake on Earth and its largest soda lake. In 1989 and 1990, we investigated the hydrochemistry of the lake's water column and of the tributary rivers. We also cored the Postglacial sediment column at various water depths. The sediment is varved throughout, allowing precise dating back to ca. 15 ka BP. Furthermore, lake terrace sediments provided a 606-year-long floating chronology of the Glacial high-stand of the lake dating to 21 cal. ka BP. The sediments were investigated for their general mineralogical composition, important geochemical parameters, and pore water chemistry as well. These data allow reconstructing the history of the lake level that has seen several regressions and transgressions since the high-stand at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Today, the lake is very alkaline, highly supersaturated with Ca-carbonate and has a salt content of about 22 g kg(-1). In summer, the warmer epilimnion is diluted with river water and forms a stable surface layer. Depth of winter mixing differs from year to year but during time of investigation the lake was oxygenated down to its bottom. In general, the lake is characterized by an Na-CO(3)-Cl-(SO(4))-chemistry that evolved from the continuous loss of calcium as carbonate and magnesium in the form of Mg-silica-rich mineral phases. The Mg cycle is closely related to that of silica which in turn is governed by the production and dissolution of diatoms as the dominant phytoplankton species in Lake Van. In addition to Ca and Mg, a mass balance approach based on the recent lake chemistry and river influx suggests a fractional loss of potassium, sodium, sulfur, and carbon in comparison to chloride in the compositional history of Lake Van. Within the last 3 ka, minor lake level changes seem to control the frequency of deep water renewal, the depth of stratification, and the redox state of the hypolimnion. Former major regressions are marked by Mg-carbonate occurrences in the otherwise Ca-carbonate dominated sediment record. Pore water data suggest that, subsequent to the major regression culminating at 10.7 ka BP, a brine layer formed in the deep basin that existed for about 7 ka. Final overturn of the lake, triggered by the last major regression starting at about 3.5 ka BP, may partly account for the relative depletion in sulfur and carbon due to rapid loss of accumulated gases. An even stronger desiccation phase is proposed for the time span between about 20 and 15 ka BP following the LGM, during which major salts could have been lost by precipitation of Na-carbonates and Na-sulfates.

Movements, home range size, and habitat use and selection of early juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in the St. Lawrence estuarine transition zone	ANADROMOUS STURGEONS: HABITATS, THREATS, AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Anadromous Sturgeons - Status and Trends, Anthropogenic Impacts, and Essential Habitats	AUG 11-13, 2003	Quebec City, CANADA					Space use and habitat selection of early Juvenile Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus have been little studied and remain largely unknown throughout the species' range. In 2000-2002, survey trawling, ultrasonic telemetry, benthos Sampling, and hydrodynamic modeling were used to determine the summer movement patterns, home range size, and habitat use and selection of early Juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in the St. Lawrence estuary. Sonic-tagged Atlantic sturgeon, assumed to be a,e 2 based on their size, used a global area estimated at 76 kin 2 that included two main core areas. Individual summer home range sizes varied from 1 to 8 km(2), but core areas were generally smaller than 1 km(2). The mean daily distance traveled ranged from 0.4 to 13.5 km/d and was significantly related to sturgeon size. Fish were located mostly in freshwater relatively close to the salt wedge boundary and far from the shore, intertidal zones, and islands. They mostly used the 6-10-m depth range relatively close to a channel, in areas with low bottom current velocities, and over silt-clay substrates. Salinity and distance from the salt wedge were the two most important variables explaining their habitat selection. Age-0 Atlantic sturgeon used similar depth ranges, bottom salinities, and current velocities, but occupied mainly sandy substrate. Management implications of these results are discussed in relation to the impact of dredging and sediment disposal operations in the St. Lawrence estuary.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-91-9				2007	56						129	+																WOS:000247562200007
S	Micklin, P				Micklin, Philip			The Aral Sea disaster	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											The Aral Sea is a huge terminal lake located among the deserts of Central Asia. Over the past 10 millennia, it has repeatedly filled and dried, owing both to natural and human forces The most recent des. iccation started in the early 1960s and owes overwhelmingly to the expansion of irrigation that has drained its two tributary rivers. Lake level has fallen 23 m, area shrunk 74%, volume decreased 90%, and salinity grew from 10 to more than 100g/l, causing negative ecological changes, including decimation of native fish species, initiation of dust/salt storms, degradation of deltaic biotic communities, and climate change around the former shoreline. The population residing around the lake has also been negatively impacted. There is little hope in the foreseeable future to fully restore the Aral Sea, but measures to preserve/rehabilitate parts of the water body and the deltas are feasible.																			0084-6597		978-0-8243-2035-5				2007	35						47	72		10.1146/annurev.earth.35.031306.140120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.earth.35.031306.140120													WOS:000247012500003

This paper discusses the possible changes of ecosystem services due to altered ecosystem functions caused by regional climate change. For this purpose, the lake's water regime was analysed and biomass production of common reed (Phragmites australis), the prevailing species, was related to ambient temperatures and water level. The effect of the latter was also examined for reed transpiration rate and plant diversity. The results revealed a gradual loss of seasonality of floods and droughts. High water level in winter months and temperatures at the beginning as well as the end of vegetation period were found to have a significant influence on reed biomass. The plant diversity research in six subsequent years in three different aquatic habitats revealed trends of a decrease due to increased water depth during the vegetation period. The complexity of the system and consequently ecosystem services might also be affected due to changes of other processes, which revealed to be related to water level; namely transpiration rate, plant mycorrhizal colonisation and soil mineralisation.

J	Sun, YS; Li, ZH; Yang, K; Wang, GH; Hu, RL				Sun, Yongshuai; Li, Zhihui; Yang, Ke; Wang, Guihe; Hu, Ruilin			Analysis of the Influence of Water Level Change on the Seepage Field and Stability of a Slope Based on a Numerical Simulation Method	WATER												River floods, dammed lake flood discharge, reservoir discharge, seawater recession, etc. all cause the water level in front of a slope to drop, which changes the original steady-state seepage field in the soil, leading to harmful slope instability. To study this phenomenon, a numerical model was established through theoretical analysis combined with the coupling of the Seep/W and Slope/W modules of the GeoStudio finite element software, and the numerical model was verified by the model test results of indoor medium sand and silt. This paper focuses on the effects when the water level in front of a slope drops at different speeds, different drop ratios, different initial water levels, different filling materials, and matrix suction on the seepage field and slope stability. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the greater the speed at which the water level in front of a slope falls, the greater the downward seepage force formed by the seepage field of the slope to the slope body; (2) the change curve of the safety factor at a higher speed is steeper when the water level falls at different speeds, and the safety factor value when the water level in front of the slope is constant is smaller; (3) the safety factor of the slope decreases with an increase in the drop ratio; when the drop ratio is the same, the loss of stability is worse if the initial water level is lower; (4) when there is a drawdown of water levels in front of the slope, the non-cohesive medium sand slope is more prone to instability failure than the cohesive silt slope; and (5) when this modeling method is applied to matrix suction, the effect of matrix suction increases the safety factor of the slope.

This study aimed at assessing the spatio-seasonal variation of water quality in relation to land use types in Lake Muhazi, Rwanda. The National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) was used to evaluate the anthropogenically-induced water quality changes. In addition to Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a Cluster Analysis (CA) was applied on 12-clustered sampling sites and the obtained NSF-WQI. Lastly, the Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM) was used to estimate the nexus between LULC, water quality parameters, and the obtained NSF-WQI. The results revealed a poor water quality status at the Mugorore and Butimba sites in the rainy season, then at Mugorore and Bwimiyange sites in the dry season. Furthermore, PCA displayed a sample dispersion based on seasonality while NSF-WQI's CA hierarchy grouped the samples corresponding to LULC types. Finally, the PLS-PM returned a strong positive correlation (+ 0.831) between LULCs and water quality parameters in the rainy season but a negative correlation coefficient (- 0.542) in the dry season, with great influences of cropland on the water quality parameters. Overall, this study concludes that the lake is seasonally influenced by anthropogenic activities, suggesting sustainable land-use management decisions, such as the establishment and safeguarding protection belts in the lake vicinity.					; Kurban, Alishir/AGK-9193-2022; NZABARINDA, Vincent/AAL-9994-2021; Isabwe, Alain/AGK-8324-2022; Mind'je, Richard/GNP-0081-2022; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; DufatanyeUmwali, Edovia/KHD-1585-2024	Isabwe, Alain/0000-0002-7420-6453; MIND'JE, RICHARD/0000-0003-4447-389X; Guo, Zengkun/0000-0002-5228-3706; Kurban, Alishir/0000-0001-9387-8127; 													2045-2322					AUG 30	2021	11	1							17376	10.1038/s41598-021-96633-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96633-9								34462606					WOS:000693354000085
J	Sakellariadou, F; Antivachis, D				Sakellariadou, Fani; Antivachis, Danae			Spectroscopic studies of dissolved organic matter in a heavily modified Mediterranean and ancient coastal lake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												DOM has a vital role in the environmental fate of numerous contaminants including trace metals and organic compounds. The aim of this research is the spectroscopic characterization of the DOM of sediment samples collected from the shoreline of a coastal and heavily modified Mediterranean lake, the appraisal of DOM nature and origin, the evaluation of impacts from lithology and land uses, the comparison of the relative effectiveness of spectroscopic approaches for chemical classification and the final combination of the results provided from each approach. UV-Vis absorption spectra suggest the presence of low molecular weight and a photochemical bleaching of chromophoric DOM. Spectral slope ratio had a negative correlation with autochthonous production and DOM molecular weight. Fluorescence spectra showed that DOM is mainly freshly produced and has an autochthonous origin. Chromophores are of a rather simple structure deriving from the degradation of plant components. The contribution of submerged springs in organic matter input was uncovered. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic chains. The presence of carboxylic, phenolic, alcoholic and polysaccharide groups was supported. A correlation of recent autochthonous material with relative depletion in hydroxyl, carboxyl, alcoholic and polysaccharide groups was found. The morphological particularity of the area with its permeable lithology and the presence of karstic springs, in combination with the land uses of the catchment area hosting heavy industrial, agricultural and urban activities, in addition to the high archaeological and ecological importance of the wetland and its surrounding area, may require the application of a sound management and environmental protection scheme.					; Sakellariadou, Fani/AAO-1773-2021	Sakellariadou, Fani/0000-0002-7489-4153; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2018	77	7							272	10.1007/s12665-018-7446-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7446-y													WOS:000429985900008

J	Kopácek, J; Hejzlar, J; Kana, J; Porcal, P; Turek, J				Kopacek, Jiri; Hejzlar, Josef; Kana, Jiri; Porcal, Petr; Turek, Jan			The sensitivity of water chemistry to climate in a forested, nitrogen-saturated catchment recovering from acidification	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Fluxes of major ions and nutrients were measured in the N-saturated mountain forest catchment-lake system of Certovo Lake (Czech Republic) from 1998 to 2014. The lake has been rapidly recovering from atmospheric acidification due to a 90% decrease in sulphate (SO42-) deposition since the late 1980s and nitrate (NO3-) contribution to the pool of strong acid anion and leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased. Present concentrations of base cations, phosphorus (P), total organic N (TON), and ionic (Al-i) and organically bound (Al-o) aluminium in tributaries are thus predominantly governed by NO3- and DOC leaching. Despite a continuing recovery lasting 25 years, the Certovo catchment is still a net source of protons (H+), producing 44 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) H+ on a catchment-area basis (corresponding to 35 mu mol L-1 on a concentration basis). Retention of the deposited inorganic N in the catchment averages 20%, and ammonium consumption (51 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) and net NO3- production (28 mol m(-2) yr(-1)) are together the dominant terrestrial H+ generating processes. In contrast, the importance of SO42- release from the soils on terrestrial H+ production is continuously decreasing, with an average of 47 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) during the study. The in-lake biogeochemical processes reduce the incoming acidity by similar to 40%, neutralizing 23 mu mol L-1 H+ (i.e., 225 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) on a lake-area basis). Denitrification and photochemical and microbial decomposition of DOC are the most important in-lake H+ consuming processes (50 and 39%, respectively), while hydrolysis of Al-i (from tributaries and photochemically liberated from Al-o) is the dominant in-lake H+ generating process. Because the trends in water chemistry and H+ balance in the catchment-lake system are increasingly related to variability in NO3- and DOC leaching, they have become sensitive to climate-related factors (drought, elevated runoff) and forest damage that significantly modify the leaching of these anions. During the study period, increased exports of NO3- (accompanied by Al-i and base cations) from the Certovo catchment occurred after a dry and hot summer, after forest damage, and during elevated winter runoff. Increasing DOC export due to decreasing acid deposition was further elevated during years with higher runoff (and especially during events with lateral flow), and was accompanied by P, TON, and Al-o leaching. The climate-related processes, which originally "only" confounded chemical trends in waters recovering from acidification, may soon become the dominant variables controlling water composition in N-saturated catchments.

Reversible solubility at buffered P(CO2) yields the following expression for the dissolution constant of ikaite: log K(ikaite) = 0.15981 -2011.1/T. Where T = degrees-K, and 0-degrees-C less-than-or-equal-to t less-than-or-equal-to 25-degrees-C. Derived standard state properties are DELTAG-degrees(ikaite) = -2541.9 kJmol-1 +/- 0.66; DELTAH-degrees(ikaite) = -2973.4 kJmol-1 +/- 1.02; S-degrees(ikaite) = 306.6 JT-1mol-1 +/- 1.2. Modeling shows that ikaite is undersaturated at all temperatures in seawater and in alkaline lakes, but that it rapidly approaches saturation near 0-degrees-C. Its precipitation in near-freezing marine sediments requires large additions of HCO3 to pore fluids from the diagenetic decomposition of organic matter. Its crystallization in tufas of alkaline lakes, however, requires only small additions of Ca from springs. Simple kinetic experiments show that ikaite is stabilized in natural environments by orthophosphate, which prevents the crystallization of the more stable anhydrous forms of CaCO3 but does not interact with the ikaite. Therefore, the presence of ikaite or its pseudomorphs is an indicator of near-freezing conditions in environments with high concentrations of orthophosphate. If ikaite is the precursor of thinolite tufa, then the thinolite likely grew below the sediment-water interface at the site of sublacustrine springs during prolonged cold periods.																			0022-1376					JAN	1993	101	1					21	33		10.1086/648194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/648194													WOS:A1993KG66900002

On the other hand, low frequency sea level fluctuations originating in Sydney Eight, immediately outside the Lakes, are only moderately affected. The fluctuations in Sydney Eight are predominantly the result of the isostatic adjustment of sea level to atmospheric pressure changes. The resulting sea level gradient drives flow into ol out of the Lakes.

Materials and methods Six transects which paralleled the lakeshore were established at a typical Carex lakeshore wetland of Poyang Lake. We performed the field investigation and sampling in the autumn growing seasons in a flooding year (2017) and a drought year (2018). Paired t test was carried out to determine the effects of inter-annual water regime variation on various soil and plant parameters. Redundancy analysis was used to examine the relationships of plant species composition with flooding and soil variables in both years. Results and discussion Soil water content (SW), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), the ratio of SOC to TP (C/P ratio), the ratio of TN to TP (N/P ratio), ammonia nitrogen concentration (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen concentration (NO3-N) were 21 71% higher in the flooding year than in the drought year. Plant Shannon-Wiener indices were significantly lower in the drought year than in the flooding year, whereas aboveground and belowground plant biomass showed opposite patterns. Flooding and soil variables could strongly determine plant communities in both years. Flooding duration was the most important variable among all flooding and soil variables. After eliminating the effects of flooding duration, pH and SW still significantly affected plant community composition in the flooding year, while only NH4-N significantly impacted on plant species distribution in the drought year. Conclusions The results provided direct evidences that the inter-annual water regime variation not only could dramatically modify soil and plant variables but also could change the soil-vegetation relationship in the wetlands. Our studies have great implications for the conservation and restoration of the wetlands, especially for the lake wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River.					/AAB-6512-2020; Shen, Ruichang/O-4305-2017; HUANG, XINGYUN/LIC-2734-2024	Huang, Xingyun/0000-0001-6450-8522; Shen, Ruichang/0000-0003-0055-8058; 													1439-0108	1614-7480				SEP	2020	20	9					3368	3379		10.1007/s11368-020-02638-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02638-8		MAY 2020											WOS:000534716600002

The instrument was deployed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to support remote sensing validation and harmful algal bloom (HAB) satellite products. The Lake Erie SeaPRISM is also part of the international federated AERONET program maintained by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and more specifically is part of the AERONET Ocean Color (AERNOET-OC) network. The main purpose of this component of AERONET is specific to calibration/validation efforts for ocean color. The AERONET-OC network currently consists of 23 field radiometers at aquatic sites around the world. The Lake Erie site is the second freshwater lake location world-wide after the Palgrunden site in Sweden. During its operating period from mid July to early September 2016, various environmental conditions were observed including a cyanobacteria bloom. Water-leaving radiance observations were generated on 43 out of 51 days, and varied by a factor of five. The variability in the above-water radiometry tracked that of in-water measurements made by a nearby buoy. During this brief operating window, satellite matchups were generated for several satellites.

Here, a protocol based on Pearson's product moment correlation analysis combined with standardized data treatment and expert judgement was developed to sort out the MIB producer(s), mainly based on routine monitoring data from an estuary drinking water reservoir in the Yangtze River, China, and a risk model using quantile regressions was established to evaluate the risk of MIB occurrences. This reservoir has suffered from MIB problems in summer since 2011. Among 323 phytoplankton species, Planktothrix was judged to be the MIB producer in this reservoir because it exhibited the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.60) as well as the lowest false positive-ratio (FP% = 0) and false-negative rate (FN% = 14). The low false-positive rate is particularly important, since MIB should not detected without detection of the producer. A high light extinction coefficient (k = 5 . 57 +/- 2.48 m(-1)) attributed to high turbidity loading in the river water lowered the subsurface water light intensity, which could protect the low irradiance Planktothrix from excessive solar radiation, and allow them to grow throughout the summer. The risk model shows that the probability of suffering unacceptable MIB concentrations (> 15 ng L-1 ) in water is as high as 90% if the cell density of Planktothrix is > 609.0 cell mL(-1), while the risk will be significantly reduced to 50% and 10% at cell densities of 37.5 cell mL(-1) and 9.6 cell mL(-1), respectively. The approach developed in this study, including the protocol for identification of potential producers and the risk model, could provide a reference case for the management of source water suffering from MIB problems using routine monitoring data.

J	HENDERSONSELLERS, B				HENDERSONSELLERS, B			DESTRATIFICATION AND REAERATION AS TOOLS FOR IN-LAKE MANAGEMENT	WATER SA												During the summer, the water in many reservoirs (dams) exhibits a thermal stratification, which may have deleterious effects on water quality. The lower layer (hypolimnion) may become anoxic, permitting the release of reduced gases. The lack of O2 affects the biota and the water chemistry and it is often desirable to avoid such occurrences. To overcome this natural problem it is possible to aerate the water and/or prevent or destroy the stratification. Such techniques are described and theoretical aspects of 1 example (the Helixor unit) are considered.																			0378-4738	1816-7950					1981	7	3					185	189																WOS:A1981LY81200008

The aim of this study is to investigate the infection of Ch. ferox in Oriental storks (Ciconia boyciana) and assess its potential threat to their health, while exploring its prevalence in different host habitats and prey species. Morphological and molecular analyses were conducted on trematode specimens and its eggs in fecal samples of Oriental storks collected from wintering habitats (Poyang Lake), stopover sites (Bohai Bay), and breeding grounds (Sanjiang Plain), as well as metacercaria in crucian carp collected from stopover sites. A high Ch. ferox prevalence of 96.3% was observed in 27 deceased storks, with the infected individuals showing granulomatous intestinal damage such as nodular and perforation. Additionally, Ch. ferox egg was detected in environmental fecal samples from wintering habitats (1.4%), stopover sites (5.4%), and breeding grounds (5.6%), as well as in crucian carps (3.1%). These findings suggest that Ch. ferox prevalent in Oriental storks related to consumption of infected crucian carp. The high infection rate of Ch. ferox (96.3%) in deceased storks, compared to the lower infection rate (1.4-5.6%) in field individuals (detected the parasite eggs in the environment fecal samples of storks), indicates that Ch. ferox may have an impact on the health of Oriental storks with high probability. However, its direct role in mortality of stork warrants further investigation.

Time-transgressive onset of the Holocene Optimum in the East Asian monsoon region	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The East Asian summer monsoon affects precipitation and hence vegetation in the densely populated Northwest Pacific region, yet a long-standing controversy exists concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Holocene Optimum (HO) in the East Asian Monsoon Region. Here we use a detailed 14,000-year record reconstructing vegetation variations from a strategically selected crater lake from Northeast China, as well as a compilation of previous paleoclimatic studies, to show that the HO began around 6,000 Cal a BP in Northeast China, significantly later than generally recognized. By comparing our paleoenvironmental data with Holocene vegetation records from other regions of East Asia, we identified a marked northward shift for the onset of the HO from similar to 10,260 Cal a BP in South China to similar to 6,000 Cal a BP in Northeast China. The gradual northward transgression of the vegetation change could be caused by both the temperature and precipitation changes in different regions. Finally, we fitted a regression model of the start of the HO period versus latitude, which allowed us to make predictions for the beginning of the HO at different geographical locations. This study reveals a strong relationship between latitude and the initiation of the HO, and provides a window towards better understanding the forcing of vegetation changes in the East Asian monsoon region.

A global database of lake surface temperatures collected by in situ and satellite methods from 1985-2009	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Global environmental change has influenced lake surface temperatures, a key driver of ecosystem structure and function. Recent studies have suggested significant warming of water temperatures in individual lakes across many different regions around the world. However, the spatial and temporal coherence associated with the magnitude of these trends remains unclear. Thus, a global data set of water temperature is required to understand and synthesize global, long-term trends in surface water temperatures of inland bodies of water. We assembled a database of summer lake surface temperatures for 291 lakes collected in situ and/or by satellites for the period 1985-2009. In addition, corresponding climatic drivers (air temperatures, solar radiation, and cloud cover) and geomorphometric characteristics (latitude, longitude, elevation, lake surface area, maximum depth, mean depth, and volume) that influence lake surface temperatures were compiled for each lake. This unique dataset offers an invaluable baseline perspective on global-scale lake thermal conditions as environmental change continues.

FA content was analysed by chromatographic mass spectrometry. Our observation's over two years indicated that the FA profiles of both Baikalian ice and benthic populations of U. zonata, as are typical for other green algae, showed a high level of polyunsaturated FAs (50-70%, depending on season) related to the adaptation of the alga to low temperature. Rising temperature in the algal habitat entailed a prominent drop in the proportion of monoenoic cis-7-hexadecenoic acid (from 0.8%, to 3.5% in 2006). These results favour the hypothesis that monoenoic FAs play a principal role in maintaining the cellular membrane fluidity of U. Zonata.

J	Selart, A; Tvauri, A; Läänelaid, A				Selart, Anti; Tvauri, Andres; Laanelaid, Alar			KASTRE CASTLE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ART HISTORY												Kastre (sometimes called Uue-Kastre) Castle on the north shore of the Emajogi River has been almost totally destroyed. At one time it belonged to the Tartu bishops, and a trade route connecting the Baltic Sea countries and Russia through Tartu and Pskov ran past the castle. In the Middle Ages, this also marked the actual boundary of the Tartu bishopric, since only unsettled wetlands covered the area between the castle and the lake. The Kastre Castle is mentioned in the written records for the first time in 1392 as a customs checkpoint, in connection with a treaty between the Hanseatic towns and Novgorod. There was a barrier near the castle that was stretched over the river with a rope or chain, which stopped the boats and ships from sailing through without stopping. When the Pskovians launched a military expedition on their lod'ya boats against the Tartu bishopric in 1342, there is no mention of the Kastre Castle. The place name is probably based on the Old Russian word koster' (kappa omicron cmep(sic)), which meant stronghold and has been used as a loan word in the eastern Finnic languages. The German name of Kastre is Warbek, and the current explanation is that this meant "river defence" (Middle German were des bekes). However, were has also meant fish barrier, i.e. a fishing structure built across the flow of the river. In 1993, the owner of the castle property had the moats around surrounding the castle and outer bailey dredged and widened, which changed their location and appearance notably. The first archaeological studies at the castle were conducted to verify the damage caused by this unauthorised excavation work. In 1994, the profile of the ground exposed by excavator rooting around in the moats was documented. In 2001, the first archaeological excavations took place at the site of the Kastre Castle. There were plans to build a new structure between the walls of the tavern that had been built on the site of the castle in the late 18th and 19th century, and the necessary trenches were dug in the course of the archaeological rescue excavations. Supervision of the construction work, as well as excavation work related the cleanup of the moats and surrounding property, continued for the next few years. Depending on the location, the excavations reached the cobblestone paving that was located 40-120 cm below the prior ground level in the courtyard and interiors of the castle. In 2001, wood samples were taken from the logs that were revealed on the western slope of the western moat of the Kastre outer bailey, and had been used to fortify the incline. The dendrochronological study shows that the logs were fell after the 1376 growth period (summer). Therefore, the moat of the Kastre outer bailey was probably fortified in 1377. The direct motivation for building the castle may have been the border war between Pskov and the Tartu bishopric that lasted from 1367 to 1371. The main battlefield of the war was Lake Peipsi, and a dispute about the fishing rights in Lake Lammijarv has been given as the main explanation for the war. Kastre was a very important medieval fishery centre for the lower Emajogi River and Lake Peipsi. Here the import of fish was taxed. In the vicinity, one could find the fishing grounds of the Tartu bishop, the Cathedral Chapter, the town of Tartu, monasteries and private manors, as well as of the Teutonic Order. The water and winter roads that ran through Kastre from Tartu toward Russia or Narva comprised an important traffic zone, which the castle controlled. Kastre was the centre of the relevant Tartu bishopric's administrative division. The bishops are said to have visited the border castle personally on many occasions, so suitable rooms must have existed at the castle. An idea of the castle is provided by plans from 17th century. The castle was built in at least two stages. Its foundations were built on log floats. First an unusual rectangular building of fieldstones and bricks was built, the longest wall of which was 17,5 metres and the shortest 12 metres; the walls were 2,5 to 2,8 metres thick. The walls on the north and northwest side of the castle were built later against the originally planned walls; whereas the upper parts of the original northern and eastern walls were demolished. A subsequent addition was the cannon tower on the southeast corner of the castle, which is indicted on plans from the late 17th century, and the diameter of which, based on these plans, would have been about 9,5 metres. Considering the location of the walls that have been revealed, most of the tower's foundation walls have been washed away by the Emajogi River. Apparently a wooden building was located in the northern part of the castle's courtyard. The castle was surrounding by a moat that was up to 15 metres wide. It is not possible to determine the exact time of the different stages of construction. From the dendrochronological studies we can conclude that the outer bailey, or at least the area surrounded by moats, is not a later construction but most probably one of the oldest parts of the castle. Bricks typical of the 14th and 15th centuries have been used in the walls of the first construction stage; the addition, based on the dimensions of the bricks, is a later construction. There have been no finds on the entire property that date back to the period before the 15th century. On the west side of the castle, there is an area that is about 60 metres long and wide, and surrounded by a 10-metre-wide moat. The cultural layer here is only a ten or so centimetres thick. There were probably no stone buildings here; but it's possible that wooden outbuildings were already located here when it was a bishopric castle. A tavern and outbuildings are indicated on the 17th century plans. In the course of cleaning the moats, wooden shore fortifications came to light in the northeast corner of the outer bailey. There was a small settlement near the castle, which, in 1601, included 21 households - 20 of them fishers and one brewer. A Mary Magdalene chapel is mentioned in 1613 here. A cemetery is located on the western side of the castle, which could have surrounded a chapel. The Kastre Castle has been repeatedly associated with military events, such as border wars and internal conflicts. In the Livonian War, Kastre was one of the first castles that fell into the hands of the Russians in 1558. Based on the Truce of Yam-Zapolsky, the castle was transferred to Poland in 1582. During the Russo-Swedish War in 1656, the Swedes were able make repairs the castle and make it defensible, and they stationed a garrison there. However, it still fell into Russian hands until the Treaty of Karde was signed in 1661. In the late 17th century, the Swedes planned to completely rebuild the castle. But as of 1704, the castle was still in ruins. After the Great Northern War, being inside the borders of the Russian Empire, the Kastre Castle lost its potential military importance. By the second half of the 18th century, the castle had turned into "a pile of stones", from which a tavern was built.

Cass.] is imported into the USA for use as birdseed. An early maturing niger cultivar, 'EarlyBird' may have the potential to be grown in the northern Great Plains. This study evaluated the effect of different EarlyBird niger seeding rates on seed yield, test weight, plant height, and pest incidence. Eight to ten seeding rates, ranging from 0.56 to 16.8 kg ha(-1), or 15 to 465 pure live seeds m(-2), were evaluated in seven environments: Red Lake Falls (RLF) and Kennedy (Ken), MN, in 2000 and 2001, and Carrington (Car), Langdon (Lan), and Prosper (Pro), ND, in 2001. Mean yield across the seven environments was 355 kg ha(-1). At RLF00 and RLF01 (Red Lake Falls, MN, 2000 and 2001) the mean yield was 535 and 580 kg ha-1, respectively. Maximum yields across all environments corresponded to a seeding rate of 284 seeds m(-2) and a plant stand of 157 plants m(-2), or approximately 10.0 kg seed ha(-1), whereas 90% of the maximum yields corresponded to a seeding rate of 127 seeds m(-2) and a plant stand of 72 plants m(-2), or the planting of slightly under 6.7 kg seed ha(-1). Plants at the lowest seeding rate had more heads and higher aboveground biomass per plant than the other seeding rates evaluated; however, individual head weight did not differ. For production purposes, a seeding rate of 6.7 kg ha(-1) provided high yields with early canopy closure and uniform seed maturation.					; Weisberg, Stephen/B-2477-2008	Weisberg, Sanford/0000-0002-1141-6699; 													0011-183X					JAN-FEB	2004	44	1					190	197		10.2135/cropsci2004.0190	http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.0190													WOS:000187633900025

Arctic tundra fires: natural variability and responses to climate change	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic climate change may result in novel disturbances to Arctic tundra ecosystems. Understanding the natural variability of tundra-fire regimes and their linkages to climate is essential in evaluating whether tundra burning has increased in recent years. Historical observations and charcoal records from lake sediments reveal a wide range of fire regimes in Arctic tundra, with fire-return intervals varying from decades to millennia. Analysis of historical data shows strong climate-fire relationships, with threshold effects of summer temperature and precipitation. Projections based on 21st-century climate scenarios suggest that annual area burned will approximately double in Alaskan tundra by the end of the century. Fires can release ancient carbon from tundra ecosystems and catalyze other biogeochemical and biophysical changes, with local to global consequences. Given the increased likelihood of tundra burning in coming decades, land managers and policy makers need to consider the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of fire in the Far North.					; Higuera, Philip/B-1330-2010; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Kelly, Ryan/OEN-4960-2025	Young, Adam/0000-0003-2668-2794; Higuera, Philip/0000-0001-5396-9956; 													1540-9295	1540-9309				SEP	2015	13	7					369	377		10.1890/150063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/150063													WOS:000360583200016

Mechanisms of formation and bacterial colonization of aggregates were investigated under well-defined conditions by using rolling tanks. Abundance, form, and composition of aggregates in Lake Kinneret were controlled by biological as well as by physical parameters such as the phytoplankton standing stock and wind-induced shear forces. In meso-eutrophic Lake Kinneret, the abundance of aggregates ranged between <1 and 1001(-1) and numbers of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) reached up to 6915 ml(-1). Ow laboratory experiments using natural lake water samples indicated that cations, particulate organic carbon (POC), and TEP controlled aggregation. According to differences in formation and composition of aggregates, their bacterial colonization was highly variable; colonization was highest on cyanobacterial aggregates. High aminopeptidase activities of aggregate-associated bacteria indicated a rapid turnover of particulate organic matter (POM) and led to a release of dissolved amino acids into the ambient water. Efficient grazing of lake snow aggregates by juvenile fish from Lake Kinneret (Acanthobrama terraesanctae and A. lissneri) suggested that POM on aggregates can be directly transferred to higher trophic levels. Thus, aggregates with associated microorganisms are not only sites of vertical fluxes, centers of rapid and efficient recycling of POM, and a source of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but also a potentially important food source for higher trophic levels.

These release rates were multiplied by an "anoxic factor", based on the area and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia, to estimate internal phosphorus load. Despite individual variation, the experimentally derived internal loads determined from hypolimnetic phosphorus increases at the end of summer stratification, except at internal loads < 50 mg m-2 yr-1. Therefore, laboratory release rates can help predict internal loads after lake conditions have changed, e.g. after in-lake restoration measures.

Multiple factors operate simultaneously and interact in complex ways to shape community assembly. Understanding the organisation of communities including species interactions and the importance of driving factors (food, temperature, nutrients, oxygen concentration, etc.) is a central topic in ecology. Intra-annual variation in zooplankton and the factors that drive them are described in the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) conceptual model. However, there has been little empirical evidence quantifying the relative contribution of abiotic and physical factors to plankton seasonality in zooplankton communities. 2. Using a long-term time series of zooplankton abundances and environmental conditions, we investigated which physical, chemical, and biotic factors structure zooplankton communities. We quantified their importance in seasonal changes in species composition by exploring networks of interacting species in the Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic). We investigated how these factors were associated with seasonal and intra-annual (across all seasons) patterns of temporal variation in zooplankton. 3. We predicted that: (1) the zooplankton community in the Rimov Reservoir follows the general seasonal PEG pattern; (2) abiotic factors play an important role in the temporal distribution of zooplankton at the intra-annual scale, but their influence on the community declines at the seasonal scale; and (3) the network of interacting species is more complex at the seasonal scale than at intra-annual scale, so biotic drivers most strongly influence zooplankton patterns at seasonal scales. 4. The intra-annual pattern of zooplankton abundance was mainly determined by the physical environment. As expected, the roles of abiotic drivers of community assembly changed between seasons. There were more interactions between abiotic factors and species structuring the community at the intra-annual scale than at the seasonal scale. Additionally, these interactions were weaker at the seasonal scale than the intra-annual scale. The intra-annual zooplankton community of the Rimov Reservoir was the most stable, while the summer zooplankton community was the most variable. 5. Our results provide evidence that the network of interacting zooplankton taxa is composed of positive and negative relationships, which suggests facilitative, competitive, and predator-prey interactions. Although zooplankton species interactions have an influence year-round, the network of interacting species is more complex during the vegetative period and especially in summer, when species richness and abundance are high. Our results suggest that the zooplankton community is structured by both the biotic network at the seasonal scale and by the physical environment at the intra-annual scale. 6. Seasonal succession in zooplankton communities of temperate lakes is a well-known pattern. However, the influence of interspecific interactions within seasons on this pattern has not been clearly shown until this study. Exploring the community in only one season may provide incomplete knowledge of the factors and species interactions driving the whole community.					; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; GABALDÓN, CARMEN/N-3245-2017; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Devetter, Miloslav/G-1087-2014; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2019	64	7					1326	1341		10.1111/fwb.13308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13308													WOS:000471049400009

Interannual to millennial-scale variability of River Ammer floods and its relationship with solar forcing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The relationship between River Ammer flood frequency variability, extreme summer climate over Europe, and solar forcing is investigated. First, we used observational data to evaluate extreme weather and climate anomaly patterns associated with flood and solar forcing as well as the possible dynamical mechanisms behind them. Then, the annual resolution flood layer record from the Lake Ammer sediments is analysed to evaluate millennial-scale variability of floods and possible related extreme climate patterns back to 5,500 years BP. A composite analysis reveals that observed River Ammer flood frequency variability at interannual to multidecadal time scales is connected to large-scale extreme precipitation and temperature patterns. From a synoptic-scale perspective, the extreme precipitation pattern associated with floods is related to an increase in the frequency of high upper-level potential vorticity (PV) events over western Europe and a decrease over eastern Europe and western Russia. Increased (decreased) frequency of upper-level high PV events is related to more (less) surface extreme precipitation occurrence. Furthermore, we show that increased frequency of upper-level high PV events over western Europe is associated with enhanced blocking activity over eastern Europe. Therefore, the out of phase interannual to millennial-scale variations of River Ammer flood frequency and solar irradiance, as presented in previous studies, can be explained by a solar modulation of eastern European-western Russia summer blocking and associated upstream upper-level wave breaking activity. In addition, we identify two distinct quasi-periodic signals in both frequency of Lake Ammer flood layer and solar irradiance records with periods of similar to 900 years and similar to 2,300 years. We argue that similar cycles should dominate millennial-scale variations of blocking activity in eastern Europe-western Russia as well as extreme precipitation and flood frequency variability over central and western Europe during the last similar to 5,500 years.

Senthil			Ice sheet features identification, glacier velocity estimation and glacier zones classification using high resolution optical and SAR data	LAND SURFACE AND CRYOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING III	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing III	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			Ice sheet features, glacier velocity estimation and glacier zones or facies classification are important research activities highlighting the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers in Polar Regions and in inland glaciers. The C-band inSAR data is of ERS 1/2 tandem pairs with one day interval for spring of 1996 and L-band PolinSAR data of ALOS-PALSAR-2 for spring of 2015 is used in glacier velocity estimation. Glacier classification is done using multi-temporal C-and L-band SAR data and also with single date full polarization and hybrid polarization data. In first part, a mean displacement of 9 cm day-1 was recorded using SAR interferometric technique using ERS 1/2 tandem data of 25-26 March 1996. Previous studies using optical data based methods has shown that Gangotri glacier moves with an average displacement of 4 cm and 6 cm day-1. As present results using ERS 1/2 data were obtained for one day interval, i.e., 25th March 05:00pm to 26th March 05: 00 pm, 1996, variation in displacement may be due to presence of snow or wet snow melting over the glacier, since during this time snow melt season is in progress in Gangotri glacier area. Similarly the results of glacier velocity derived using ALOS-PALSAR-2 during 22 March - 19 April 2015 shows the mean velocity of 5.4 to 7.4 cm day-1 during 28 day time interval for full glacier and main trunk glacier respectively. This L-band data is already corrected for Faraday's rotation effects by JAXA, and tropospheric correction are also being applied to refine the results. These results are significant as it is after gap of 20 years that DInSAR methods has given glacier velocity for fast moving Himalayan glacier. RISAT-1 FRS-1 hybrid data is used to create Raney's decompositions parameters, which are further used for glacier zones classification using support vector machine based classification method. The Radarsat-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2 fully polarized data of year 2010 and 2015 are also used for glacier classification. The identified and classified glaciers zones in Gangotri area are debris covered ice, clean ice, percolation zone, wet snow zone, ice wall, supra-glacier lakes and moraines,similarly ice sheet features and glacier landforms such as such as Nunataks, Wind scoop, Glacier flow paths, Moraine, Horn, Sastrugi, and Crevasses were identified in Antarctic. RISAT-1 FRS-1 data was also successful in mapping the Crevasses hidden under wind-blown ice in Antarctic's study area.

J	Liao, Z; Zhai, PM; Chen, Y; Lu, H				Liao, Zhen; Zhai, Panmao; Chen, Yang; Lu, Hong			Atmospheric circulation patterns associated with persistent wet-freezing events over southern China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Persistent wet-freezing events (PWFEs), a typical type of compound extremes, combine adverse effects from both its precipitation and temperature components, thereby posing great threats to human society and ecosystem. Atmospheric circulation patterns that govern the occurrence and persistence of PWFEs over southern China are identified and classified, based on cases during 1980-2010. There are two dominating types of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns responsible for PWFEs: a single blocking high type and a double blocking high type. The single blocking high type tends to occur under positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) phase, characteristics of a long-lived blocking high over the Lake Baikal in the middle troposphere favouring lower-level cold air masses penetrate southwards along a northeast-southwest route. Likewise, abundant water vapour advances northwards from the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, meeting cold air masses over southern China under the upper-level divergence caused by the intensified upper-level subtropical jet which prevails on top of the western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Locally, a stable temperature inversion structure is anchored in the lower troposphere. The double blocking high type features blocking highs over the Ural Mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk, along with an intensified trough between them. The upper-level subtropical jet over mid-latitude East Asia strengthens, providing divergence fields at upper troposphere. Low-level cold air masses move southwards from the Lake Baikal along a north route, converging with the water vapour transported from the Bay of Bengal to southern China by a low-level southwesterly jet. By contrast, the inversion layer is absent atop the region experiencing double blocking PWFEs. Regardless of event types, the duration of PWFEs is dedicated by Rossby wave energy dispersion through its role in maintaining blocking patterns during the PWFEs.

The lake existed between the years 1990-2012 and occupied two partial depressions in the bedrock, separated by a bedrock ridge for the dominant period of its history. Whereas the eastern depression was almost completely infilled due to direct fluvial input, the western depression revealed only thin sedimentary cover and was dotted from the eastern depression by an outflow of surficial waters. Gilbert delta deposits with typical tripartite zones of topset, foreset and bottomset were recognised in the eastern depression. Topset was comprised by deposits of a braided river. Foreset is formed by deposits of sediment gravity flows (turbidity currents and debris flows). Bottomset is represented by alternating suspension deposits and deposits of hyperpycnal underflows (low-density turbidity currents). The ruling factors of the evolution of the delta were glacier retreat, bedrock morphology, both affecting the relative lake level, and the rate of sediment delivery. Glacier retreat over stepped and inclined bedrock morphology led to delta prograding and downstepping. The recognised fluvio-deltaic terraces revealed four lake level falls followed by fluvial downcutting, erosion and redeposition of the older deltaic/lake deposits, the shifting of the lake's position towards the damming glacier and the transition of the sediment input in the same direction. The termination of the lake was a result of further glacier retreat and the opening of subglacial drainage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Periphyton Dynamics along a Stream with a Gradient of Human Impact	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The impact of anthropogenic development on periphytic communities was studied within Finkle Brook of Bolton Landing, New York. Finkle Brook is located in the Lake George watershed and has increasing anthropogenic development from the headwaters to the mouth. Periphyton was collected and quantified (as algae, bacteria, and fungi) from both natural and artificial substrates during the summer of 2007. On natural substrates, the headwater site supported the highest organic material but the least algal growth. On artificial substrates, the more developed downstream sites usually supported significantly more periphytic growth than the headwater site. Algal and fungal growth peaked early in the sampling period (June), whereas bacterial density and total organic material had the most accumulation at the end of the growing season (September). These results support the hypothesis that periphyton increases in biomass and changes in community structure as a response to factors associated with anthropogenic development.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2010	25	3					385	394		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664381													WOS:000281047300008
J	Paus, A				Paus, Aage			Human impact, soil erosion, and vegetation response lags to climate change: challenges for the mid-Scandinavian pollen-based transfer-function temperature reconstructions	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Precise and accurate reconstructions of past environmental parameters from high-quality palaeoenvironmental studies are critical for realistic testing of climate models. To ascertain the reliability of the reconstructions of the past, cross-validation from a variety of proxies and methods is essential. Mid-Scandinavia, showing a variety of palaeoecological studies, is a suitable region for comparing and validating environmental reconstructions. Here, pollen-based transfer-function reconstructions show inconsistent late-glacial temperature patterns. They also show that the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) occurs at ca. 7.5-4.5 cal. ka b.p. However, thermal indicators (pollen, megafossils, plant macrofossils) place the HTM at no later than ca. 10-7.5 cal. ka b.p. It is argued that after the onset of the early Holocene warming equilibrium between vegetation and climate was established over a prolonged period; i.e. ca. 1,500 and 4,000 years in the mountains and lowlands, respectively. In the mountains, soil drought, wind and winter stress were important factors causing the lag, whereas inter-specific competition and soil development delayed the succession within the species-diverse lowland forests. These lags when vegetation was not filling its thermal potential result in a distortion of the temperature signal as derived by transfer functions which assume that vegetation is essentially in equilibrium with climate. Due to widespread human impact and erosion today, many modern training set samples are unsuitable as reference material for past environmental conditions. Various recommendations are suggested towards making improvements in the pollen-transfer function approach to climate reconstructions. To overcome the difficulties resulting from vegetation lags in the early Holocene, proxies that have a faster response time to climate, such as chironomids and aquatic plants including algae, may replace terrestrial pollen.					paus, aage/AAJ-8096-2020														0939-6314	1617-6278				MAY	2013	22	3					269	284		10.1007/s00334-012-0360-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-012-0360-4													WOS:000316880400009

During the following two winters (1993-1994 and 1994-1995) we carried out detailed sampling during the autumnal overturn period. As a result of lake overturn in mid-December, CH4 that had accumulated in the hypolimnion during the stratification period mixed rapidly throughout the water column. Increased CH4 in the epilimnion quickly disappeared after the overturn as a result of the rising of CH4 oxidation activity throughout the water column. The in situ-specific CH4 oxidation rate peaked at 0.274, 0.235, and 1.01 d(-1) at 0.5, 20, and 36 m, respectively, during the overturn, and then declined the following month. During this period, the diffusive flux of methane across the air-water interface increased but was not the dominant sink (avg rate of 4.5 kg lake(-1) d(-1)); instead, methane oxidation in the water column was the dominant CH4 sink (avg rate of 67.8 kg lake(-1) d(-1)), removing similar to 94% of the CH4 during the overturn period. A significant methane flux from the bottom sediments throughout the overturn period was confirmed but decreased gradually as the overturn proceeded. The production of organic carbon as a result of CH4 oxidation in the water column by methanotrophs was comparable in extent to that generated by primary production at that time.

Influence of water level management on vegetation and bird use of restored wetlands in the Montezuma Wetlands Complex	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Active water management of wetlands promotes seed and tuber production to feed migrating waterfowl, but few assessments exist to determine how management actions influence wetland structure, vegetation and bird response throughout the year. We identified effects of full water drawdown, partial water drawdown and passive wetlands (no active dewatering during the growing season) on plant communities and bird abundance in wetlands of the Montezuma Wetlands Complex, New York, May-October 2016-2018 and February-April 2017-2019. We detected few differences in the plant community during June, but during September we detected greater vegetative forage quality index for waterfowl, annual plant cover and seed density in full and partial drawdowns than passive wetlands. Bird abundance was greater in June-July in passive wetlands and greater in September-October in full drawdowns. During spring migration, duck densities were greater in full and partial drawdowns. Our results indicate that wetland managers should use a mix of full drawdowns and passive wetlands to provide habitat for the greatest diversity and number of birds throughout the year.

We repeated stool examinations and hepatosplenic ultrasonography in a cohort of 120 individuals living on an island with endemic infection in Dongting Lake, China. Prevalence of schistosome infection fell by 43% and intensity (geometric mean eggs per gram) declined by 80% over the 5 years. However, transmission persisted at a dangerously high rate of 13% per year for re-infection or new infection in the cohort. The prevalence of left-lobe enlargement and dilated portal vein fell significantly (P < 0(.)01) to about half initial levels although a few patients progressed during the study period. At study endpoint, infection was nearly twice as common if the portal vein was dilated (23% versus 13%, respectively), but this association was not statistically significant (P > 0(.)05). However, endpoint infection was even more strongly associated with left-lobe enlargement (57% versus 15%. P < 0(.)01). The proportions of subjects with improved parenchymal and periportal fibrosis were much higher than the proportions of subjects that progressed (P < 0(.)05). Reduction of prevalence and intensity of infection, and improvement of subdinical morbidity, were benefits of repeated treatments. Further research is needed to understand why some patients developed fibrosis despite substantial reductions in egg counts and to evaluate the functional importance of residual subdinical morbidity after chemotherapy-based control in the lake and marshland area of China.

It is dammed at its north end by the Anuchin Glacier and the ice-cover dynamics are controlled by sublimation - not melt - as the dominating ablation process and therefore surface melt during austral summer does not provide significant amounts of water for recharge compared to subsurface melt of the Anuchin Glacier. Several studies have already described the structure and function of the microbial communities within the water column and benthic environments of Lake Untersee, however, thus far there have been no studies that examine the linkages between the lake ecosystem with that of the surrounding soils or the Anuchin Glacier. The glacier may also play an important role as a major contributor of nutrients and biota into the lake ecosystem. Based on microbial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we showed that the dominant bacterial signatures in Lake Untersee, the Anuchin Glacier and its surrounding soils were affiliated with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Aerosol and local soil depositions on the glacier surface resulted in distinct microbial communities developing in glacier ice and cryoconite holes. Based on a source tracking algorithm, we found that cryoconite microbial assemblages were a potential source of organisms, explaining up to 36% of benthic microbial mat communities in the lake. However, the major biotic sources for the lake ecosystem are still unknown, illustrating the possible importance of englacial and subglacial zones. The Anuchin Glacier may be considered as a vector in a biological sense for the bacterial colonization of the perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee. However, despite a thick perennial ice cover, observed "lift-off" microbial mats escaping the lake make a bidirectional transfer of biota plausible. Hence, there is an exchange of biota between Lake Untersee and connective habitats possible despite the apparent sealing by a perennial ice cover and the absence of moat areas during austral summer.

Deep groundwater and potential subsurface habitats beneath an Antarctic dry valley	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The occurrence of groundwater in Antarctica, particularly in the ice-free regions and along the coastal margins is poorly understood. Here we use an airborne transient electromagnetic (AEM) sensor to produce extensive imagery of resistivity beneath Taylor Valley. Regional-scale zones of low subsurface resistivity were detected that are inconsistent with the high resistivity of glacier ice or dry permafrost in this region. We interpret these results as an indication that liquid, with sufficiently high solute content, exists at temperatures well below freezing and considered within the range suitable for microbial life. These inferred brines are widespread within permafrost and extend below glaciers and lakes. One system emanates from below Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney and a second system connects the ocean with the eastern 18 km of the valley. A connection between these two basins was not detected to the depth limitation of the AEM survey (similar to 350 m).

BP) triggered the rearrangement of vegetation across Europe. To better understand that response, we analysed both an extended fossil pollen data set and robust present-day site parameters from NE Germany in a data model comparison approach. This approach allowed to quantify past plant abundances in sub-regional landscape patterns, as defined by soil types and relief. Betula was the first tree taxon to expand from scattered stands that already existed during the Younger Dryas. The major tree taxa Betula and Pinus fully established after 200 400 years as largely separated stands of Pinus on well drained sandy and Betula on fertile morainic soils. Corylus started to spread after 11,200 cal. BP, yet the final expansion was delayed until 10,800 cal. BP. Corylus established on gleyic soils, from which it largely expelled Betula. Throughout the first two millennia of the Holocene, open grasslands existed on fine grained soils, where seasonal dryness prevented the establishment of deciduous trees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

During three summer field seasons, duplicate Russian and American coves were taken at a number of sites in different sedimentary environments in the lake. Eight cores returned to the U.S. were quantitatively analyzed for biogenic silica using a single-step 5-hour alkaline leach, followed by dissolved silicon analysis by inductively-coupled-plasma atomic-emission spectroscopy. Sediments of Holocene age in these cores have biogenic silica maxima that range from about 15 to 80 percent. An underlying zone in each core with low biogenic-silica concentrations (0 to 5 percent) dates from the last glacial maximum. The transition from the last glaciation to the present interglaciation, recorded by biogenic silica, began about 13,000 years ago. Biogenic silica profiles from these cores appear to be a good measure of past diatom productivity and a useful basis for paleoclimatic interpretations.

J	Zhang, W; Li, LP; Ren, JH				Zhang, Wei; Li, Liping; Ren, Jinghua			Influence of Atmospheric 10-20 Day Low Frequency Oscillation on Regional Strong Cooling Events in the Winter of Northern China over the Past 40 Years	ATMOSPHERE												Using daily minimum temperature data at 2481 stations provided by the National Meteorological Information Center (China) and the daily reanalysis data from NCEP/NCAR during the period from 1980 to 2019, the effects of atmospheric low frequency oscillations (LFOs) on the regional strong cooling events (RSCEs) in the winter of northern China are investigated, and the extended range forecast signals of the RSCEs are extracted. The results show that: (1) The frequency of RSCEs is higher before the year 2000 and then decreases, but its interannual variability increases. There are 10-20, 20-30 and 30-60 d significant low frequency periods in the regional average minimum temperature in northern China, and the low frequency oscillation with a period of 10-20 d is the most significant. (2) The low frequency key systems affecting RSCEs in the west, middle, and east of northern China are the Ural blocking high and the trough of Lake Balkhash-Baikal (Lake Ba-Bei), the blocking high in the northwest and the low trough in the southeast of Lake Ba-Bei, the Lake Ba-Bei blocking high and the East Asian trough, respectively, and the Siberian High (SH) that expands and moves with the blocking high all the time. The low frequency jets at the upper level are weaker in the north and stronger in the south. (3) The low frequency high potential vorticity (PV) center in the lower stratosphere moves eastward and southward along the 315 K isentropic surface via the north of Lake Ba-Bei, southern Lake Baikal and Northeast China to the Sea of Japan, causing the 2 PVU line to move southward and then the above-mentioned high PV center in the mid-high troposphere to extend vertically. Meanwhile, under the influence of gradually increasing upper level jets and vertical meridional circulation, the high PV column continues to propagate downward to the mid-low troposphere at lower latitudes along the 300-315 K isentropic surfaces, which enhances the low frequency positive vorticity and deepens the key trough. In addition, the convergence in the upper troposphere, the divergence in the lower layer, and the development of descending motion behind the trough lead to the development and southward movement of the SH. (4) At -10 d, the positive and negative low frequency anomalies at 500 hPa geopotential height appearing in the East European Plain and Western Siberian Plain are the extended range forecast signals for RSCEs in the winter of northern China, respectively.																				2073-4433				SEP	2022	13	9							1406	10.3390/atmos13091406	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091406													WOS:000856207800001
J	Weber, MJ; Flammang, M; Schultz, R				Weber, Michael J.; Flammang, Mark; Schultz, Randall			Estimating and Evaluating Mechanisms Related to Walleye Escapement from Rathbun Lake, Iowa	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Reservoir fisheries present managers a unique set of challenges. One of the most obvious, yet overlooked, challenges to maintaining sustainable reservoir fisheries is escapement. Yet, little is known about the escapement of reservoir fishes or factors influencing escapement. From June 2009 through March 2011, 4,137 Walleyes Sander vitreus >300mm were collected in the tailrace of Rathbun Lake, Iowa, individually tagged with visual implant tags, and returned to the reservoir to estimate escapement rates and identify influential factors. During this time, escapement was estimated as (1) the percentage of tagged Walleyes at large that were recaptured in the tailrace and (2) the proportion of tagged to untagged Walleyes present in Rathbun Lake. Tailrace recapture rates during individual sampling events ranged between 0.0% and 2.1% and minimum annual tailrace escapement was estimated as 13.6% (SE, 3%). In spring 2010, 8% (SE, 1%) of the Rathbun Lake Walleye population had been tagged and by spring 2011, 26% (SE, 2%) of the Walleyes were tagged, indicating that they had previously escaped. To understand factors related to escapement, individual fish capture-recapture data were analyzed in Program MARK using a multistate model to estimate apparent survival, detection, and escapement probability. Probability of escapement increased with increasing mean daily discharge and decreased with increasing fish length and release distance from the dam. Variable weights indicated that discharge was the primary factor related to escapement. Escapement probability increased exponentially with daily discharge and doubled as discharge increased from 40 to 60m(3)/s. Our results suggest a substantial proportion of the Rathbun Lake Walleye population has been lost recently, due in part to record water releases, making management of this reservoir fishery challenging.

The presence of floating algae poses difficulties for accurately estimating the distribution of aquatic vegetation in eutrophic lakes. We present an approach to map the distribution of aquatic vegetation in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow eutrophic lake in China) and reduce the influence of floating algae on aquatic vegetation mapping. Our approach involved a frequency analysis over a 2003-2013 time series of the floating algal index (FAI) based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three phenological periods were defined based on the vegetation presence frequency (VPF) and the growth of algae and aquatic vegetation: December and January composed the period of wintering aquatic vegetation; February and March composed the period of prolonged coexistence of algal blooms and wintering aquatic vegetation; and June to October was the peak period of the coexistence of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation. By comparing and analyzing the satellite-derived aquatic vegetation distribution and 244 in situ measurements made in 2013, we established a FAI threshold of -0.025 and VPF thresholds of 0.55, 0.45 and 0.85 for the three phenological periods. We validated the accuracy of our approach by comparing the results between the satellite-derived maps and the in situ results obtained from 2008-2012. The overall classification accuracy was 87%, 81%, 77%, 88% and 73% in the five years from 2008-2012, respectively. We then applied the approach to the MODIS images from 2003-2013 and obtained the total area of the aquatic vegetation, which varied from 265.94 km(2) in 2007 to 503.38 km(2) in 2008, with an average area of 359.62 +/- 69.20 km(2) over the 11 years. Our findings suggest that (1) the proposed approach can be used to map the distribution of aquatic vegetation in eutrophic algae-rich waters and (2) dramatic changes occurred in the distribution of aquatic vegetation in Lake Taihu during the 11-year study.					; Liu, Xiaohan/AGS-6555-2022; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021	Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004														2072-4292				AUG	2015	7	8					10295	10320		10.3390/rs70810295	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70810295													WOS:000360818800037

An in-phase covariability is identified in July precipitation between the Kazakhstan-Xinjiang region and North China, which is the leading mode of precipitation variability. Geopotential height anomalies over the Mediterranean Sea and Kara Sea regions show persistence from June to July and contribute to July geopotential height and associated precipitation anomalies over the Kazakhstan-Xinjiang region through the dispersion of Rossby wave energy. The geopotential height anomalies over the Kara Sea also affect downstream geopotential height anomalies from the eastern coast of China to the Okhotsk Sea and related precipitation over North China through a Rossby wave from the Kara Sea to the Okhotsk Sea via the Lake Baikal. In addition, the Tibetan Plateau geopotential height anomaly during June may modulate downstream geopotential height anomalies around the Okhotsk Sea during the ensuing July through a slowly-varying northeastward shift and extension of atmospheric anomalies on intraseasonal timescale. The joint effect of geopotential height anomalies over the three regions during June leads to the co-variability of precipitation between the Kazakhstan-Xinjiang region and North China in July. Based on the above physical connection, we defined a June Kara-Mediterranean-Tibetan Plateau geopotential height index. This atmospheric precursory index shows a high skill in predicting the co-variability of July precipitation.

Predicting median monthly chlorophyll-a concentrations	LIMNOLOGICA												Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a plant pigment which is used in many environmental monitoring programs as a water quality indicator for lakes. However, monthly Chl-a data are often lacking in many monitored lakes as measurements are concentrated to certain periods of the year. This study investigates two methods of how monthly Chl-a medians can be predicted (i) new monthly regression models from median summer total phosphorus concentrations and latitude, (ii) and with monthly constants added to regression models from the literature. Data from 308 lakes were used and the trophic status of the lakes ranged from oligotrophic to hypertrophic, they were located from northern Sweden (Europe) to southern Florida (North America). These models may be useful for understanding the general Chl-a seasonality in lakes and for managing lakes in which Chl-a measurements are not made over the whole year. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

A typical paleochannel (paleo-oxbow lake type) section of the Yellow River was identified within the Zoige Basin on the NE Tibetan Plateau. A multi-index approach was used to accurately identify sediments of different genetic types, such as riverbed deposits of the Yellow River, paleo-oxbow lake deposits, and overbank flood deposits (OFD) in the section. Based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and AMS C-14 dates, we examined the environmental evolution recorded by the section. The results show that: (1) The section is a record of environmental change since 4.17 +/- 0.49 ka. During 4.17 +/- 0.49 to 3.24 +/- 0.26 ka, the ancient Yellow River occupied the channel. At 3.24 +/- 0.26 ka, the paleochannel experienced a neck cutoff, and the fluvial environment began to change into the oxbow lake environment. After 2.45 +/- 0.11 ka, the paleo-oxbow lake gradually disappeared. Subalpine meadow soil has developed at this site since 1.31 +/- 0.05 ka. (2) Paleoenvironmental proxies indicate that the Zoige Basin was warmer and wetter before similar to 3.00 ka, and became drier and colder after similar to 3.00 ka, which may be mainly related to the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the strengthening of the Westerlies. (3) Two episodes of extreme overbank flooding occurred at 2.96 +/- 0.24 to 2.87 +/- 0.27 ka and 1.84 +/- 0.20 to 1.70 +/- 0.16 ka, correlated with climate shift period from the mid-Holocene climatic optimum to the late Holocene and the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP), respectively. Due to the relatively cold and dry climate in these periods, glaciers generally advanced on the Tibetan Plateau, and the contribution of snow and ice meltwater weakened. Therefore, the strong rainfall caused by the abnormal atmospheric circulation may be the main cause of these extreme overbank flooding.

Here, we examined effects of chinook salmon (Oncorhychus tshawytscha ), an exotic species introduced to Lake Ontario to enhance recreational angling, on reintroduced Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar ) in a Lake Ontario tributary stream. Field enclosure studies revealed that adult Atlantic salmon activity rate was elevated, nest establishment delayed and mortality rates higher in the presence of chinook salmon.

This alteration is a proxy for water-rock interaction in magmatic-hydrothermal systems and associated high-sulphidation mineralizing environments, as well as for how these systems translate changes in the magmatic system to surface emissions, which are used in volcanic hazard monitoring. Detailed bulk chemical study of altered and unaltered samples shows that alteration is characterised by near-complete leaching of all major and trace elements, except for Pb, Sn and Sb, which are progressively enriched (Pb up to 15-fold absolute enrichment). The resulting element release is complementary to the observed changes in composition of the Banyu Pahit water downstream, when corrected for dilution, indicating that alteration progressively increases the element load. The signature of the change in water chemistry is best explained by complete alteration of fresh rock, rather than mature alteration, which might be expected given the advanced altered state of the riverbed. Together with mass balance considerations, this indicates that the dominant element source is material falling into the river from the valley flanks. The chemical signature of the crater lake is inconsistent with the observed alteration in samples from the hydrothermal system, and likewise is best explained by surface input of cations from rocks falling in from the crater walls. This indicates that the lake water cation chemistry is not a direct reflection of the underlying magmatic-hydrothermal system and that its cation content is therefore not an appropriate monitor of changes in volcanic activity.

We construct from these an LMP family and a proper-time family of time coordinates, the intersection of which is PG time. We demonstrate that these coordinate families are distinct, but related, one-parameter generalizations of PG time, and show linkage to Lemaitre coordinates as well.																			0001-7701	1572-9532				MAY	2015	47	5							56	10.1007/s10714-015-1891-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10714-015-1891-7													WOS:000354208200010

Phylogeography of the Habronattus amicus species complex (Araneae: Salticidae) of western North America, with evidence for localized asymmetrical mitochondrial introgression	ZOOTAXA												The frequency and significance of hybridization and gene introgression in spiders (Araneae) is unclear, largely because few studies have combined multiple lines of evidence in the study of systems where introgression is likely. Here we consider multiple types of data to gauge the prevalence and importance of mitochondrial introgression for three species of the Habronattus amicus species complex distributed in western North America. A comprehensive phylogeographic sample recovers some geographically-coherent mitochondrial clades, but conspicuously fails to resolve nominal species as monophyletic. This pattern of discordance between molecules and morphological taxonomy is studied in more detail for two species, H. amicus (Peckham and Peckham) and H. ustulatus (Griswold), found in syntopy on three dune systems in south-central Oregon. Here, multivariate morphological analyses clearly distinguish these two species, but also reveal a narrow window of size overlap between small H. amicus females and large H. ustulatus males. A quantitative assessment of microhabitat use shows that these species occupy different microhabitats at two of three dune systems, but that this difference breaks down at a single site (Summer Lake). Consistent with the size overlap and ecological data, mitochondrial data suggest interspecific gene flow at Summer Lake, which is apparently asymmetric from H. amicus into H. ustulatus. The introgression dynamics revealed in south-central Oregon impact our interpretation of mitochondrial gene trees for the entire species complex, and provide important insight into how hybridization may be influencing evolution in this diverse spider genus.																			1175-5326	1175-5334				DEC 9	2009		2307					39	60																WOS:000272535300002

With temperatures and nutrient runoff predicted to increase within the next decades, climate change poses a threat to lake communities. However, current predictions on the effect of these environmental factors on the abundance and timing of peak zooplankton numbers are based on correlations rather than on experimental isolation of thermal from other confounding effects. We present results of warming (4 degrees C above ambient) and increased nutrient loading on plankton communities in 48 outdoor mesocosms, simulating fishless and hypertrophic ponds. The timing of the chlorophyll a peak and crustacean zooplankton peak abundance, dominated by Daphnia pulex, responded strongly to temperature and nutrient addition. Daphnia numbers reached peaks 22-24 days earlier in heated than in unheated mesocosms. The chlorophyll a peak abundance advanced by 15-19 days with heating. Phytoplankton, total zooplankton and D. pulex reached peak abundance 12-19 days later when doses of nitrogen and phosphorus were added; this finding contradicts predicted earlier phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak abundances with nutrient enrichment. Peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances did not differ with temperature treatment, contrary to our expectations, but peak abundances occurred at similar actual temperatures. Nutrient additions had no effect on the peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances in our mesocosms. Overall, climate warming is likely to advance plankton phenology in fishless ponds; however, this advance could be dampened in systems with high nutrient concentration. We found very high zooplankton abundances with warming and high nutrient loadings inducing a clear water state in all our tanks owing to heavy zooplankton grazing despite high nutrient concentrations.

Stable isotope ecology of Cape dune mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) from Elandsfontein, South Africa: Implications for C4 vegetation and hominin paleobiology in the Cape Floral Region	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The archaeological and paleontological records from the west coast of South Africa have potential to provide insights into ecosystem dynamics in the region during the mid-Pleistocene. Although the fossil record suggests an ecosystem quite different than that of the region today, we understand little about the ecological factors that contributed to this disparity. The site of Elandsfontein (EFT) dates to between 1.0 and 0.6 million years ago (Ma), preserves in situ lithic and faunal materials found in direct association with each other, and provides the rare opportunity to examine the relationship between hominin behavioral variability and landscape heterogeneity in a winter rainfall ecosystem. In this study, we examine the stable carbon isotopic composition of a large sample (n = 81) of Cape dune mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) and contemporaneous large mammals (>6 kg; n = 194) from EFT. We find that delta C-13 values of B. suillus are significantly different to those of contemporaneous large mammals from EFT indicating a significant presence of plants utilizing the C-4 photosynthetic pathway during the mid-Pleistocene, in contrast to present C-3 dominated ecosystems along the west coast of South Africa. Additionally, we find that artifact density at EFT localities is positively correlated with delta C-13 values in B. suillus enamel suggesting that evidence of more intense hominin occupation may be associated with the presence of more C-4 vegetation. Lastly, we hypothesize that this unique distribution of vegetation 1) provided abundant resources for both hominin and non-hominin taxa and 2) may have concentrated hominin and animal behavior in certain places on the ancient landscape.

In this review, we summarized the high-resolution information on glacier and climate fluctuations in the region for the past millennium and provided a synthesis of these two lines of evidence with respect to regional climate change. The key areas considered in the paper are the Elbrus area, the Teberda and Arkhyz valleys in the Western Caucasus and the Cherek Bezengiisky and Tsey valleys in the Eastern Caucasus, where the most paleoclimatic evidence has been retrieved. We focused on the fluctuation records of the ten glaciers that are best documented. To reconstruct changes in glacier length in the past, we used aerial photos, optical space images, repeated photographs and old maps. The ages of moraines were defined with the help of instrumental records, historical images, old maps, and tree-ring dating. Lichenometry was used as a supplementary tool to determine the relative ages of glacial landforms. We reviewed the collection of control points used for the lichenometric curves and determined the time limit of potential use of this method in the Caucasus to be up to one millennium. High-resolution tree-ring-based hydroclimatic reconstructions in the Northern Caucasus are presented based on the reconstruction of June-September temperature (1595-2012 CE), the mass balance reconstruction of the Garabashi Glacier (1800-2008 CE) and the runoff of the Teberda River (low-frequency variations) for May, July and August for 1850-2005 CE. The synthesis of all the available paleoclimatic records revealed several distinct climatic periods. Evidence of a warm interval (traditionally referred to as the "Arkhyz break in glaciation") preceding the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the Caucasus is based on archeological, palynological, geochemical and pedological data. However, the conclusions concerning the duration and magnitude of this warming are still vague due to the low resolution of the data available and ambiguous interpretation of the evidence. The first LIA maximum glacier extent in the past millennium is poorly constrained. According to our data, it occurred prior to the year 1598 CE (tree-ring-based minimum age). Two other major phases of advances occurred in the second half of the 17th century CE and the first half of 19th century CE. General glacier retreat in the Northern Caucasus started in the late 1840s CE, with four to five minor readvances in the 1860s-1880s CE and three readvances or steady states in the 20th century CE (1910s, 1920s and 1970s 1980s). Since the last LIA maximum in the middle of the 19th century CE, most glaciers have decreased in length by more than 1000 m, and the rise in the elevation of the glacier fronts has exceeded 200 m. The glacier advances correspond to summer temperature minima and are generally coherent with the reconstructed mass balance of the Garabashi Glacier. A comparison of a tree-ring-based summer temperature reconstruction in the Northern Caucasus with detailed reconstructions of summer temperature and glacier fluctuations in the Alps shows a pronounced agreement between the records and supports the similarity between the patterns of climatic and glacier variations in the two regions.

We applied this approach for Lake Trasimeno with the aim of increasing knowledge of phytoplankton dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales. High frequency chlorophyll-a data from the WISPstation was modeled using non-parametric multiplicative regression. The 'day of year' was the most important factor, reflecting the seasonal progression of a phytoplankton bloom from July to September. In addition, weather factors such as the east-west wind component were also significant in predicting phytoplankton seasonal and diurnal patterns. Sentinel 3-OLCI and Sentinel 2-MSI satellites delivered 42 images in 2018 that successfully mapped the spatial and seasonal change in chlorophyll-a. The potential influence of localized inflows in contributing to increased chlorophyll-a in mid-summer was visualized. The satellite data also allowed an estimation of quality status at a much finer scale than traditional manual methods. Good correspondence was found with manually collected field data but more significantly, the greatly increased spatial and temporal resolution provided by satellite and WISPstation sensors clearly offers an unprecedented resource in the research and management of aquatic resources.

HIGH MOUNTAIN LAKES PROVIDE A SEASONAL NICHE FOR MIGRANT AMERICAN DIPPERS	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We studied summer use of high elevation lakes by American Dippers (Cinclus mexicanus) in the Trinity Alps Wilderness, California by conducting repeated point-count surveys at 16 study lakes coupled with a 5-year detailed survey of all available aquatic habitats in a single basin. We observed American Dippers during 36% of the point-count surveys and found birds at 10 of 16 study lakes. Over 90% of the American Dipper sightings were in lentic habitats in Deep Creek Basin. Bird presence at a lake was positively correlated with steep rocky littoral zones and high densities of caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae. We also observed numerous successful foraging bouts on juvenile life stages of lentic-breeding amphibians. We did not find any nests at the lakes but did observe juvenile dippers. American Dippers are highly adapted to flowing waters, and our findings coupled with incidental observations from the literature and other researchers, suggests that high elevation lentic waterbodies have been largely overlooked as a seasonal niche for migrant dippers.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				SEP	2009	121	3					600	609		10.1676/08-117.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/08-117.1													WOS:000269682500016

Lures derived from female stoats received a similar number of visits to those derived from males. Blank lures with no active ingredient did not attract stoats. Most of the lures remained intact and active for about seven weeks in summer. Rodents were unaffected by the lures, being neither repelled by the scent of stoats, nor attracted to the edible casein-based carrier compound. Our results suggest that scent lures could be useful for indexing stoat populations. Trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of lures and bait, and to determine seasonal changes in lure attractiveness. Problems of supply of the active ingredients will need to be overcome.																			0301-4223					SEP	1999	26	3					175	178		10.1080/03014223.1999.9518187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.1999.9518187													WOS:000083070300002

G.			Early to Mid-Holocene Lake level and temperature records from the terraces of Lake Sunnet in NW Turkey	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Sunnet, a freshwater landslide-dammed lake in NW Anatolia, comprises a10 m thick widespread of Early-to-mid Holocene deltaic sediments. Paleo-environmental interpretation of these deposits coupled with a high-resolution data (18 yrs/sample) of stable O and C isotopes, magnetic susceptibility and total organic and carbonate contents, allows an understanding of the nature of the mid-Holocene climatic transition as well as the short duration extreme events in relatively humid NW Turkey. Detailed sedimentological logging showed that four phases of progradation of deltaic sand bodies over pro-delta muds occurred. It is suggested that they correspond to phases of increased precipitation. A sudden vertical transition from lacustrine muds to subaerial colluvial facies at 5.9 ka cal BP is considered to be due to lake level drop related to water deficit. Oxygen isotope data suggest that the Mid-Holocene transition with high mean summer temperatures initiated at 7.3 ka cal BP and continued until the end of the section, with an interruption by a humid event between 6.8 and 6.0 ka cal BP. Centennial extreme events characterized by sharp delta O-18 positive shifts (1-2 permil) are also encountered at 9.2, 8.9, 8.2, and 7.6 ka cal BP. A comparison of the Lake Sunnet record with previous Aegean and Sea of Marmara palynological and sea surface temperature data shows a good fit in terms of the timing and nature of mid-Holocene transition and Early Holocene cold events. The Lake Sunnet stable isotope record particularly suggests gradually increasing summer temperatures and hence continentality during the mid-Holocene cooling in the Mediterranean.

Invasion of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in Lake Simcoe	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study documents the timing of invasion, and initial settlement rates, density and biomass of zebra mussels in Lake Simcoe. Pumped water samples, multi-plate tower samplers, and scuba and benthic airlift surveys were used to sample veligers, post-veligers, juveniles and adult mussels. Veligers were first detected (12 veligers/m(3)) at one site during August 1992, and again at three sites (6-22 veligers/m(3)) during August 1994. During July-August 1995 veliger density increased to 12,668-52,480 veligers/m(3) at three main basin sites. Low densities of post-veligers (292-1129 individuals/m(2)) were observed on the multi-plate samplers in the main basin during summer 1994. Post-veliger densities increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude during summer 1995. Peak settlement occurred during July-August in both 1994 and 1995. During mid June to mid August, 1995 we estimated 11,249-31,477 settlers/m(2)/day for sites in the main basin but only 140 and 277 settlers/m(2)/day in Cook's Bay and Kempenfelt Bay. Growth rates of post-veligers on the tower plates were highest at the low density sites. Juvenile mussels were first detected (27-160 mussels/m(2)) on natural rock substrates during scuba and airlift surveys at 2-6 m in the main basin in December 1994 and March 1995. Two year-classes of zebra mussels, 1994 and 1995, were subsequently observed on rocky substrates in the main basin during February 1996. Juveniles comprised 98.0 +/- 1.8% of the population at that time. The mean density at depths of 2-6 m was 32,529 zebra mussels/m(2) with a mean shell-free dry biomass of 34.8 g/m(2).

J	Schwab, DJ; Beletsky, D; Lou, J				Schwab, DJ; Beletsky, D; Lou, J			The 1998 coastal turbidity plume in Lake Michigan	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In this paper, numerical models of coastal circulation, wind-waves, and sediment transport are applied to the March 1998 turbidity plume event in Lake Michigan to investigate the role of wind-induced circulation in the offshore transport of sedimentary material in Lake Michigan. Computer visualization is used to compare model results to the evidence of cross-isobath transport suggested in satellite imagery. Model results showed that circulation in Lake Michigan is highly episodic since it is almost entirely wind-driven in early spring. The characteristic wind-driven circulation pattern in the lake consists of two counter-rotating gyres, a counterclockwise-rotating gyre to the right of the wind, and a clockwise-rotating gyre to the left. The gyres are separated by a convergence zone along the downwind shore with resulting offshore flow and a divergence zone along the upwind shore with onshore flow. This two-gyre circulation pattern with offshore flow was very clearly seen during a northerly wind event in March 1998 in southern Lake Michigan. The strongest sediment resuspension occurred in the southern lake and the shallow waters along the coastline. This is because of the larger waves in southern Lake Michigan due to the dominant northerly wind in this early spring period. The two most significant sediment resuspension events were detected in the model results during the two storm events. Although results from the sediment transport model agree qualitatively with satellite imagery, they fail to simulate the initial eddy-like structure of the plume. Visualization is shown to be an effective tool for interpreting the complex turbidity patterns in the satellite imagery of the turbidity plume. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Most travertine deposits are originated by geothermal fluids stored within carbonate reservoirs in continental crust, and their morphology and areal distribution provide useful information on geometry, kinematics, and age of faults which control the fluid flow. In this paper, we focus on the tectonic control on a travertine depositional system, associated with silica sinter, developing in oceanic crust, in the Lysuskard volcano-geothermal area on the Snaefellsnes Peninsula, West Iceland. The presence of HCO3 and Ca in the geothermal fluids is related to chemical-physical processes linked to fluid-rock interaction that occurs in the geothermal reservoir made up of tholeiitic basalt, by fluids enriched in CO2 of deep origin (i.e. magmatic). Travertine deposits consist of mounds and slopes, which are still in formation and overlie the silica sinter deposits. Both sinter and travertine deposits derive from thermal springs aligned according to two trends: NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE. This evidence suggests the occurrence of buried, permeable, and thus active faults, which control the circulation of fluids containing HCO3 and Ca.

Stratigraphy and sedimentology at Bir Sahara, Egypt: Environments, climate change and the Middle Paleolithic	CATENA					2nd Developing International Geoarchaeology Conference	APR, 2007	Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, McBurney Geoarchaeol Lab, Cambridge, ENGLAND		Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, McBurney Geoarchaeol Lab			Bit Sahara, situated in northeast Africa, contains a set of sedimentary sequences that imply episodic changes in climate and environment during the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Some of the stratigraphic contexts are associated with Middle Paleolithic artifact assemblages. The artifact assemblages are typically in sands that underlie deposits composed of high amounts of carbonate or fine clastics (muds) indicative of expanding lakes and wetter climates. The wetter climates may have provided landscapes that were periodically inhabitable by Pleistocene hominids. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Westaway, J				Westaway, Jonathan			'Men Who Can Last': Mountaineering Endurance, the Lake District Fell Records and the Campaign for Everest, 1919-1924	SPORT IN HISTORY												This paper examines the post-First World War reconstruction of masculinity around notions of endurance in the British outdoor movement. From the 1860s onwards, long-distance walking trials in the Lake District became part of the regional mountaineering and rambling culture, offering middleclass mountaineers strenuous physical challenges which were expressions of regional pride and in which the Lake District became a synecdoche of the Alps, a place for excursive rehearsal of Alpine-scale ambitions. Part of a wider cultural turn towards gigantism in sport and exploration prior to the First World War, these challenges increasingly deployed insights from the lifereform and body-management movements of the late nineteenth century, drawing on developments from other endurance sports such as cycling. They culminated in the standardized but largely informal Lake District Twentyfour Hour Fell Record, the pre-war record being established by Dr Arthur Wakefield of Keswick in 1905. Post-war efforts to beat Wakefield's record by Eustace Thomas of the Manchester-based Rucksack Club demonstrated increasingly sophisticated applications of nutritional, body management and training programmes. Thomas's adoption of theoretical models of human vital capacity, based on the work of the Manchester anthropometrist and public health researcher Dr Alfred Mumford suggest that, far from amateur athletes rejecting medical and scientific advice, the adaptive physiological model that emphasized the human ability to endure and to transform itself via habituation was deeply appealing in a post-war context. Innovative experimental physical regimes and recursive strategies pioneered in the regional outdoor movement were understood by participants to have wider implications for imperial mountaineering ambitions, notably the post-war campaign to climb Mount Everest.

J	de Souza, ML; Pellegrini, BG; Ferragut, C				de Souza, Mariane Lima; Pellegrini, Barbara Golebski; Ferragut, Carla			Periphytic algal community structure in relation to seasonal variation and macrophyte richness in a shallow tropical reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The macrophyte structure can influence the development of periphytic algal community in a shallow ecosystem. We investigated the interrelationship between periphytic algal community on artificial substrate and macrophyte species richness during four seasons in a tropical shallow reservoir. The periphyton was evaluated by biomass (as AFDM), algal abundance, species composition, and species richness. Limnological variables and macrophyte coverage were determined at sites with different macrophytes richness in littoral zone. Glass slides were used as the substrate and colonization time was 30 days. Periphytic algal structure was significantly influenced by seasonality and macrophyte richness, as well as the interaction of two factors. Periphytic algal density on natural and artificial substrates was negatively correlated with macrophyte richness and coverage. High biomass, algal biovolume and dominance of Zygnemaphyceae occurred when there was an increase of Utricularia foliosa coverage (summer). Our results showed that the seasonality, and to a lesser extent macrophyte species richness, explained significant portion of the variability of periphyton biomass, algal abundance, and taxonomic composition on artificial substrate. The changes in macrophyte community may have direct consequences on the periphyton structure in a shallow tropical reservoir.

J	Gutierrez, BT; Uchupi, E; Driscoll, NW; Aubrey, DG				Gutierrez, BT; Uchupi, E; Driscoll, NW; Aubrey, DG			Relative sea-level rise and the development of valley-fill and shallow-water sequences in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts	MARINE GEOLOGY												Valley-fill sequences offshore southern Cape Cod, Massachusetts, record Late Pleistocene and Holocene subaerial and submarine sedimentation in a post-glacial setting. Complications arise because some of the lows that contain valley-fill sediments represent variations in glacial drift thickness, whereas others reflect channel incision into glacial sediments and subsequent infilling. The valley-fill preserved in topographic lows in the presently submerged glacial terrain is composed of Late Pleistocene glaciolacustrine silts and clays covered with Holocene sand units. In contrast, the valley-fill sequence preserved in incised valleys, which are thought to have been caused by groundwater seeps in the Late Pleistocene, comprises a transgressive-systems tract composed of a consistent sequence of coastal embayment and nearshore marine facies that succeeded one another in response to Holocene relative sea-level rise. This transgressive valley-fill sequence started to accumulate approximately 7600 BP and reflects the submergence and consequent onshore migration of coastal embayment and shoreline environments along Late Pleistocene spring-sapping valleys. The Holocene transgressive-systems tract that rests unconformably atop the lake deposits is limited to the upper meter of the sequence. The absence of coastal embayment and other paralic facies in these topographic lows suggests that the infilled lows did not accommodate protected coastal embayments, indicating that they were most likely filled by glacial processes prior to the Holocene transgression. The occurrence of both topographic-low and incised-valley fill sequences in Nantucket Sound reveals the depositional complexity of the deposits associated with glacial recession in the region.

J	GRIEVE, RAF; BER, TJ				GRIEVE, RAF; BER, TJ			SHOCKED LITHOLOGIES AT THE WANAPITEI IMPACT STRUCTURE, ONTARIO, CANADA	METEORITICS												The approximately 7.5 km diameter Wanapitei impact structure (46-degrees-45'N; 80-degrees-45'W) lies entirely within Lake Wanapitei in central Ontario, Canada. Impact lithologies are known only from glacial float at the southern end of the lake. Over 50% of the impact lithologies recovered from this float can be classified as suevite, <20% as highly shocked and partially melted arkosic metasediments of the target rock Mississagi Formation or, possibly, the Serpent Formation and <20% as glassy impact melt rocks. An additional <5% of the samples have similarities to the suevite but have up to 50% glass clasts and are tentatively interpreted as fall-back material. The glassy impact melt rocks fall into two textural and mineralogical types: a perlitically fractured, colorless glass matrix variant, with microlites of hypersthene with up to 11.5% Al2O3 and a ''felted'' matrix variant, with evidence of flow prior to the crystallization of tabular orthopyroxene. These melt glasses show chemical inhomogeneities on a microscopic scale, with areas of essentially SiO2, even when appearing optically homogeneous. They are similar in bulk composition for major elements, but the felted matrix variant is approximately 5x more enriched in Ni, Co and Cr, the interelement ratios of which are indicative of an admixture of a chondritic projectile. Mixing models suggest that the glassy impact melt rocks can be made from the target rocks in the proportions: approximately 55% Gowganda wacke, approximately 42% Serpent arkose and approximately 3% Nipissing intrusives. Geologic reconstructions suggest that this is a reasonable mixture of potential target rocks at the time of impact.																			0026-1114					SEP	1994	29	5					621	631		10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00775.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00775.x													WOS:A1994PF65300009
J	Smith, AP; Murray, M				Smith, AP; Murray, M			Habitat requirements of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) and associated possums and gliders on the New South Wales central coast	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												One of the largest known populations of the threatened squirrel glider occurs in the Wyong and Lake Macquarie regions of the New South Wales central coast. A study of the habitat requirements and density of this population was undertaken as a component in a broader study to develop a regional conservation strategy for the species. The squirrel glider was found to be widespread at an estimated average density of 0.39 animals ha(-1). It was most abundant in forests and woodlands with an overstorey of winter-flowering eucalypts ( Corymbia maculata, Eucalyptus robusta, Eucalyptus tereticornis) or an understorey of winter-flowering banksias (Banksia spinulosa) or pinnate-leaved acacias (Acacia irrorata). The highest estimated density (0.7 ha(-1)) occurred in associations of scribbly gum ( Eucalyptus haemastoma or racemosa), smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) and red bloodwood ( Corymbia gummifera) with an understorey of Banksia spp and Xanthorrhoea spp. The lowest estimated densities occurred in forests with an understorey dominated by casuarinas or non-pinnate acacias and in stunted, low (< 17 m high) forest and woodland close to the coast. The abundance of all possums and gliders increased significantly with canopy height, canopy cover, the number of mature and old-growth trees and the number of trees with hollows. Preferred habitat of the squirrel glider in this region occurs predominantly on freehold land where it is threatened by clearing for coastal development. Implementation of planning provisions to protect squirrel glider habitat on private land will be necessary to maintain the existing regional population.

Distribution and regulation of urea in lakes of central North America	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Urea accounts for similar to 50% of global nitrogen (N)-based fertiliser; however, little is known of the factors regulating its distribution and abundance in freshwaters. Improved understanding of urea biogeochemistry is essential because its use as fertiliser is expected to double by 2050 and because pollution with urea can promote outbreaks of toxic cyanobacteria in phosphorus (P)-rich lakes in regions with intensive agricultural or urban development. 2. Biweekly measurements of urea concentration and diverse limnological variables (water chemistry, hydrology, algae, zooplankton) were taken during two summers (2008, 2009) in a chain of seven productive lakes within a 52 000-km2 catchment in central Canada to quantify environmental and anthropogenic correlates of temporal and spatial patterns of urea occurrence. 3. Mean (+/-SD) urea concentrations varied between 29 +/- 14 and 132 +/- 65 mu g N L-1, generally increased from headwater to downstream sites and represented 1050% of bioavailable N (as sum of , and urea). Principal components analysis demonstrated that urea concentrations were elevated in agriculturally impacted lakes with abundant dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients (N, P, C) and low O2 concentrations, but were not correlated consistently with plankton abundance or community composition. Urea concentrations were more than twofold greater in lakes receiving N from cities than in agriculturally affected basins, despite low summer concentrations of urea in tertiary-treated urban effluent (c. 50% of lake values). Multiple regression models evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion showed that mean water-column O2 concentration was the single best predictor of in situ urea concentrations (r2 = 0.91, P = 0.002), but that urea concentrations were also correlated significantly with changes in longitudinal position and Secchi depth and with concentrations of , non-urea dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved inorganic carbon. 4. Additional seasonal surveys of up to 69 closed-basin lakes within a 100 000-km2 region during 2004 and 2008 revealed that urea was abundant in 100% of measured sites and exhibited concentrations (81 +/- 48 mu g N L-1) similar to those observed in lakes with surface drainage (58 +/- 38 mu g N L-1). Further, non-urea DON accounted for 5099% of the total dissolved N pool in both open- and closed-basin lakes. 5. When combined with an extensive literature review and previous mass-budget analyses of the study lakes, these findings allowed the development of a first-generation model of the mechanisms regulating urea content of P-rich lakes of central North America. In this model, water-column concentrations of urea are predicted to be regulated mainly by algal decomposition in anoxic environments (sediments, hypolimnion), followed by redistribution into surface waters. Consequently, anthropogenic activities can increase the urea content of lakes by stimulating primary production, sedimentation and deepwater anoxia and by increasing influx of undegraded urea from agricultural and urban sources.

Fish assemblages in the reference lakes were classified into two types: those dominated by large-bodied piscivores and those dominated by small-bodied fishes. A discriminant function analysis with only two environmental descriptors (lake maximum depth and average slope of the catchment) could correctly predict assemblage type in 84% of reference lakes. Depth likely reflects the influence that winter oxygen concentrations have on fish assemblage type, whereas catchment slope is correlated with a variety of landscape-level features. Although potential effects of forest harvesting and tire can increase the susceptibility of lakes to winter hypoxia (via nutrient enrichment) and alter connectivity to the regional drainage network (via altered hydrology), fish assemblages in 93% of the disturbed lakes did not deviate from the discriminant function predictions, suggesting little, if any, assemblage-level effects of the disturbances over the 1-2-year time period of our study. Indeed, the level of disturbance in a catchment could explain less than 3% of the variation in assemblage structure, although a slight increase in the catches of white sucker Catostomus commersoni and a greater proportion of small individuals in white sucker populations may have reflected a modest enrichment effect in burned lakes. Current levels of landscape disturbance on the Boreal Plains appear to have minimal effects on lake fish assemblages but, because of the susceptibility of these takes to winterkill, higher levels of terrestrial disturbance could prove detrimental.

Besides giving a first contribute to the knowledge of the typical and quite unstudied pelagic microflora in this basin, we meant to give evidence to the sea streams role on floating cells carrying and consequently on marine vivication proceeding. To this aim, we have chosen two collecting stations (named FC and FV) coinciding with the two communication channels to the sea, and other similar stations (A, B, C) between Foce Capoiale and centre of the basin. The results have shown a strong prevalance, both in quality and in quantity, of the Diatoms, especially of some species of genus Chaetoceros, of Rhizosolenia alata f. gracillima, Amphora hyalina and Cylindrotheca closterium. Among Dinoflagellates only genus Prorocentrum, particularly P. balticum, was found in large quantity. All the other classes was desultorily found and in small quantity. While selective action of lagoon water is evident on structure of phytoplankton communities, particular relations among distribution of floating vegetal cells, collecting depth levels and sea streams direction have not been found, so far as now. Further researches are being held, yearly and in several different stations, to improve the knowledge both of the environment and of phytoplanktonic communities in this coastal lake.																			0007-9723	2262-3094					1990	31	1					65	74																WOS:A1990DV23400005
J	Alvarado, GE; Soto, GJ; Salani, FM; Ruiz, P; de Mendoza, LH				Alvarado, Guillermo E.; Soto, Gerardo J.; Salani, Flavia M.; Ruiz, Pablo; Hurtado de Mendoza, Luis			The formation and evolution of Hule and Rio Cuarto maars, Costa Rica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					3rd International Maar Conference (3IMC)	APR 14-17, 2009	Malargue, ARGENTINA					The Hule and Rio Cuarto maars are respectively located 11 and 18 km northward of the active crater of Poas volcano, on the Caribbean side of the Central Volcanic Range of Costa Rica. They lie on the northern part of Poas volcano massif, along a N-S trending, similar to 27 km-long volcanic fracture crossing the Poas volcano. The volcanic products from Hule maar (2.3 km x 1.8 km. area similar to 3.5 km(2)) are mainly pyroclastic surges (poorly vesiculated andesites with very small plagioclases), silica-rich andesitic pumice flows, air-fall deposits, ballistic blocks, and reworked deposits that overlie the regional Pleistocene volcanic basement. They were produced during three main explosive phases. Two overlapping pyroclastic cones have developed within the Hule maar, and at least three lava fields are related to them (high-Al basalt to basaltic andesite). Another maar, Pata de Gallo (400 m across), is located less than 1 km off the SE rim of Hule. Rio Cuarto is a nearly circular maar (700-850 m across) with a surface area of 033 km2. Rio Cuarto products include surges, ballistics and air-fall tephra, produced during three main explosive phases. These deposits show a narrow fan oriented westward, according to westerly wind direction. They indicate a westerly-directed surge (first 2 km), followed by air-fall deposits (up to 5 km away). Radiocarbon dating has shown that Hule was formed similar to 6.2 ka ago and Pata de Gallo probably formed similar to 2.8 ka ago, while the intra-maar products could have ages of similar to 1.7 ka or similar to 0.7 ka, indicating that Hule is a polygenetic mar. There are no radiocarbon ages yet for dating the formation of Rio Cuarto maar, but archaeological data suggest that it erupted between 3-4 ka ago. The volume of pyroclastic deposits associated to Hule maar is estimated to be 0.51-0.53 km(3), from which similar to 20% is juvenile material, therefore 0.07-0.08 km(3) of new dense rock equivalent (ORE) magma, after subtracting 20-30% of porosity. The tephra from Rio Cuarto is estimated to be 4.4 x 10(7) m(3), of which 0.008 m(3) correspond to ORE magma. The Hule and Rio Cuarto maars are occupied by lakes and, in the last decades, several lake-overturn events have taken place, with a repeat cycle of six to seven years. The main outcome of these events has been the mass death of fish accompanied by changes in the lake color. In these systems, the hazard related to the possible occurrence of Nyos-type gas eruptions can be considered negligible or very local, but significant for tourists who camp by the lakes.

The present paper explores this hypothesis, using data from Sub-Saharan Africa. We rely on monthly data at the cell level (0.5 x 0.5 degrees), an approach that is tailored to the short-lived and local nature of the phenomenon. Using a drought index to proxy for weather shocks, we find that a one-standard-deviation fall in the index (signaling drier conditions) raises the likelihood of riots in a given cell and month by 8.3%. We further observe that the effect of unusually dry weather conditions is substantially larger in cells with a lower availability of water resources (such as rivers and lakes), a finding that supports the significance of the competition-for-water mechanism.

J	Ge, QS; Zheng, JY; Hao, ZX; Liu, Y; Li, MQ				Ge Quansheng; Zheng Jingyun; Hao Zhixin; Liu Yang; Li Mingqi			Recent advances on reconstruction of climate and extreme events in China for the past 2000 years	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												China is distinguished by a prominent monsoonal climate in the east of the country, a continental arid climate in the northwest and a highland cold climate on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Because of the long history of Chinese civilization, there are abundant and well-dated documentary records for climate variation over the whole of the country as well as many natural archives (e.g., tree-rings, ice cores, stalagmites, varved lake sediments and corals) that enable high-resolution paleoclimatic reconstruction. In this paper, we review recent advances in the reconstruction of climate and extreme events over the last 2000 years in China. In the last 10 years, many new reconstructions, based on multi-proxies with wide spatial coverage, have been published in China. These reconstructions enable us to understand the characteristics of climate change across the country as well as the uncertainties of regional reconstructions. Synthesized reconstructed temperature results show that warm intervals over the last 2000 years occurred in AD 1-200, AD 551-760, AD 951-1320, and after AD 1921, and also show that cold intervals were in AD 201-350, AD 441-530, AD 781-950, and AD 1321-1920. Extreme cold winters, seen between 1500 and 1900, were more frequent than those after 1950. The intensity of regional heat waves, in the context of recent global warming, may not in fact exceed natural climate variability seen over the last 2000 years. In the eastern monsoonal region of China, decadal, multi-decadal and centennial oscillations are seen in rainfall variability. While the ensemble mean for drought/flood spatial patterns across all cold periods shows a meridional distribution, there is a tri-pole pattern with respect to droughts south of 25A degrees N, floods between 25A degrees and 30A degrees N, and droughts north of 30A degrees N for all warm periods. Data show that extreme drought events were most frequent in the periods AD 301-400, AD 751-800, AD 1051-1150, AD 1501-1550, and AD 1601-1650, while extreme flood events were frequent in the periods AD 101-150, AD 251-300, AD 951-1000, AD 1701-1750, AD 1801-1850, and AD 1901-1950. Between AD 1551-1600, extreme droughts and flood events occurred frequently. In arid northwest China, climate was characterized by dry conditions in AD 1000-1350, wet conditions in AD 1500-1850, and has tended to be wet over recent decades. On the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, centennial-scale oscillations in precipitation have occurred over the last 1000 years, interrupted by several multi-decadal-scale severe drought events. Of these, the most severe were in the 1480s and 1710s. In southwest China, extreme droughts as severe as those seen in Sichuan and Chongqing in 2006 are known to have occurred during historical times.					; Li, Mingqi/GLU-9912-2022; Zheng, Jingyun/M-5789-2015	LIU, Yang/0000-0001-9683-9123; Ge, Quansheng/0000-0001-8712-8565; 													1009-637X	1861-9568				JUL	2016	26	7			SI		827	854		10.1007/s11442-016-1301-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-016-1301-4													WOS:000379022100004

Shifting levels of ecological network's analysis reveals different system properties	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Network analyses applied to models of complex systems generally contain at least three levels of analyses. Whole-network metrics summarize general organizational features (properties or relationships) of the entire network, while node-level metrics summarize similar organization features but consider individual nodes. The network- and node-level metrics build upon the primary pairwise relationships in the model. As with many analyses, sometimes there are interesting differences at one level that disappear in the summary at another level of analysis. We illustrate this phenomenon with ecosystem network models, where nodes are trophic compartments and pairwise relationships are flows of organic carbon, such as when a predator eats a prey. For this demonstration, we analysed a time-series of 16 models of a lake planktonic food web that describes carbon exchanges within an autumn cyanobacteria bloom and compared the ecological conclusions drawn from the three levels of analysis based on inter-time-step comparisons. A general pattern in our analyses was that the closer the levels are in hierarchy (node versus network, or flow versus node level), the more they tend to align in their conclusions. Our analyses suggest that selecting the appropriate level of analysis, and above all regularly using multiple levels, may be a critical analytical decision.

Forty years of monitoring water quality in Grasmere (English Lake District): separating the effects of enrichment by treated sewage and hydraulic flushing on phytoplankton ecology	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Grasmere is a small lake (area: 0.64 km2; mean depth 7.7 m) in a catchment with high rainfall (typically 23 m annually), which subjects the lake to intermittent episodes of rapid flushing. 2. An overview of the trends in water quality and of phytoplankton of Grasmere is presented, covering almost 40 years of observations following the construction and commissioning of a waste-water treatment plant to serve a nearby village. 3. There was a threefold increase in annual areal phosphorus loading during the 25 years following commissioning. Moving the original outfall of the sewage works from the River Rothay, just above its inflow into Grasmere, to a point in the lake, 7.5 m below the surface and, normally, below the summer thermocline, mitigated direct biomass response to epilimnetic enrichment. Maximum concentrations of chlorophyll a increased about twofold, but the annual mean concentrations altered little; interannual variability seems to relate more to flushing than to changing fertility. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred during years of relative summer drought. 4. Since 1996, nutrient loadings have been alleviated by better wastewater management and tertiary treatment of effluents discharged during dry weather. Recent chlorophyll a maxima have declined with the reduced supportive capacity of phosphorus availability. 5. An updated annotated list of phytoplankton species known to have occurred in Grasmere is provided. The incidence and abundance of species supposed to indicate eutrophication probably reflect the enrichment that has occurred, while others, mostly associated with oligo-mesotrophic lakes, seem to have declined. Inherently slow-growing species (of Ceratium, Microcystis) have been unable to establish a significant presence in the lake. A group of algae in Grasmere that indicate nutrient-poor, acidic habitats are suggested to originate in the catchment and flourish briefly in the wake of flushing events.

Changes in the thermal structure of freshwater lakes within Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) from 1996 to 2014	INLAND WATERS												Freshwater lakes throughout many parts of the world have undergone substantial warming in response to climate change. In southern New England, within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS; Massachusetts, USA), numerous freshwater lakes known as "kettle ponds" scattered throughout the landscape have exhibited increasing surface water temperatures for the past 2 decades. In this study, we examined changes in summer air temperatures, wind speeds, underwater light transmission (3 of the primary factors influencing lake thermal structure}, and the temperature profiles of 9 ponds from 1996 to 2014. Mean, minimum,and maximum daily air temperatures all increased significantly while mean daily maximum and average wind speeds declined. The attenuation of light to 50% and 25% of surface intensities occurred at significantly greater depths in 7 ponds, whereas the depths at which light transmission was 1% of surface values increased in 3 ponds.Thermocline depths became shallower in 2 ponds while temperature between surface and bottom waters increased in 6 ponds. Bottom waters exhibited significant cooling in 4 ponds while Schmidt stability values (which indicate the strength of thermal stratification) increased in 5 ponds.Thermocline depth among ponds was positively correlated with light transmission variables for the majority of years between 1996 and 2014, and all temperature variables were significantly correlated with mean daily air temperature. The patterns indicate a general strengthening of thermal stability during the summer and seem to be related to increasing local air temperatures and reduced wind speeds. Implications of changes in the thermal properties of CCNS ponds are discussed in the context of potential physical, chemical, and ecological processes.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2018	8	1					36	49		10.1080/20442041.2018.1427949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2018.1427949													WOS:000437349500004

Habitat fragmentation drives divergent survival strategies of a cold-water fish in a warm landscape	ECOSPHERE												Climate change is a global phenomenon, but natural selection occurs within landscapes. Many global analyses predict how climate change will shape behavior and physiology, but few incorporate information from the landscape scales at which animals actually respond to selective pressure. We compared cold-water fish (redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) from neighboring habitats in a naturally warm, recently fragmented basin to understand how different responses to warming may arise from landscape constraints. Trout in warm, hydrologically connected Upper Klamath Lake fled summer temperatures and sought refuge in cool tributaries, while trout in an equally warm but fragmented reach of the Klamath River endured summer conditions. Trout in the river were more physiologically tolerant of high temperatures than trout in the lake across multiple metrics, including capacity for aerobic activity, recovery from exertion, and loss of equilibrium. Two independent metrics of energetic condition indicated that the behavioral strategy of trout in the lake came at a substantial energetic cost, while the physiological strategy of trout in the river was able to mitigate most energetic consequences of high temperatures. No clear genetic basis for increased tolerance was found in trout from the river, which may suggest tolerance was derived from plasticity, although our analysis could not rule out genetic adaptation. Our results show that landscape processes such as fragmentation can cause different climate survival strategies to emerge in neighboring populations. Connecting the mechanisms that favor similar survival strategies among related organisms at broad scales with mechanisms that drive landscape-scale variability within taxa should be a major goal for future predictions of biological responses to climate change.					; OMalley, Kathleen/ABF-7373-2020	Hahlbeck, Nick/0000-0002-8341-6452; 													2150-8925					JUL	2023	14	7							e4622	10.1002/ecs2.4622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4622													WOS:001032759900001

To close this knowledge gap, we tracked the short-term and inter-annual responses of Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) to an unexpected SPD event in a plateau wetland. Immediately after SPD (2022-2023), dissolved MeHg (DMeHg) in pore water peaked in August, whereas dissolved Hg (DHg) in interface water peaked in May, revealing a temporal decoupling pattern. Spatially, seasonally inundated sediment had significantly higher DHg and DMeHg concentrations than permanently inundated sediment, an unexpected pattern that contrary to total Hg. Moreover, in May, DHg level in pore water fell below that in interface water, posing a reverse result previously recorded. The SPD-induced accumulation of algal particles, plant residues and minerals shifted water DOM toward higher protein-like fractions and aromaticity. These changes, combined with hydrological fluctuation and anaerobic condition, lead to the multi-scale distributions of Hg and MeHg. Two synchronous changing patterns were also formed: protein-like fractions and DMeHg peaked in pore water during algal blooms, while DHg and aromaticity increased in interface water at early rainy stage. The PLS-PM model further reveals that, among various environmental factors, DOM properties have the most positive impacts on MeHg production, and the contributions of DOM compositions, such as protein-like fractions, are particularly pronounced. From 2014 to 2023 following SPD event, sediment MeHg and its fraction in Hg fell to 78.95 % and 38.64 % of its 2014 level, while DHg and DMeHg declined by 44.52 % and 47.06 %, respectively. Concomitant enrichment of alkoxy carbon and sulfate at the sediment-water interface likely contributes to this long-term evolution. The SPD event is unexpected, but it reshapes the distribution patterns of Hg and MeHg, underscoring the need to incorporate this event into future Hg-risk assessments of plateau wetlands.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2026	288		A						124638	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124638								41005275					WOS:001585722400006

A comparison of the diel variability in epilimnetic temperature for five lakes in the English Lake District	INLAND WATERS												High temporal resolution temperature measurements were analysed for 5 neighbouring lakes in the English Lake District to assess how the diel range in epilimnetic temperature varied among the lakes. These lakes experience the same climate but differ morphometrically, allowing lake-specific drivers of diel variability to be determined. The magnitude of the diel temperature cycle was calculated as the difference between the measured maximum and minimum daily epilimnetic temperature. Our analysis demonstrated that the magnitude of the diel temperature cycle was primarily influenced by the depth of the upper mixed layer. The magnitude of the diel temperature cycle was lowest for the largest lake, Windermere South Basin, which varied by approximately half that of the smallest lake, Blelham Tarn. A significant correlation between the diel temperature range and lake area was observed in the summer months caused by the larger lakes typically experiencing higher wind speeds, which in turn lead to greater mixing depths and thus to a lower diel temperature range. Water temperature has a major effect on lake biology and biogeochemistry, so it is important to recognise its variability in different lake types.

J	Shiwei, C				Shiwei, Chen			Intellectual preparedness: Dr. Hu Shih, Lake Forest College, and Chinese diplomacy during World War II	JOURNAL OF MODERN CHINESE HISTORY												The summer of 1941 was a critical juncture in WWII history. As the war intensified and threatened the security of the United States, the American people were sharply divided into two opposing political camps, one sympathetic to interventionism and the other in favor of isolationism. Frightened by the recent memory of WWI and the reality of a worldwide economic depression, many Americans believed that their country should separate itself from troubling events in the world, thereby refuting President Roosevelt's call for America to intervene against Hitler's aggression in Europe and Japan's atrocities in Asia. Against this historical background, Dr. Hu Shih, Chinese ambassador to the United States, came to Lake Forest in Illinois, the center of the isolationist movement, in the summer of 1941 to deliver a speech at Lake Forest College's Sixty-Third Annual Commencement. This article uses various archives to reveal an untold story about Dr. Hu's speech-diplomacy during his ambassadorial career. Tied to this event was a drama conveyed via multiple layers of historical accounts and contextualized by a series of political discourses ranging from the rise of isolationism in America to China's use of soft-power diplomacy in the international arena, in which Dr. Hu played a significant role.																			1753-5654	1753-5662					2015	9	2					153	174		10.1080/17535654.2015.1107270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17535654.2015.1107270													WOS:000421611600001

Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope composition (N-15:N-14, delta N-15 and C-13:C-12, delta C-13) have been widely used to elucidate changes in aquatic ecosystem dynamics created by eutrophication and climate warming, often, however, without accounting for seasonal variation. 2. Here, we aim to determine the factors controlling the stable isotope composition and C:N ratio of seston and periphyton in shallow lakes with contrasting nutrient loadings and climate; for this purpose, we followed the monthly stable isotope composition (c. 1 year) of seston (SES) and periphyton (PER) in 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes with two nutrient treatments (enriched and unenriched) and three temperature scenarios (ambient, +3 and +5 degrees C). 3. Nutrient enrichment and warming had a stronger impact on the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of seston than on periphyton, and the temporal isotopic variability in both communities was large. 4. delta N-15(PER) did not differ markedly between nutrient treatments, whereas delta N-15(SES) was lower in the enriched mesocosms, possibly reflecting higher N-2-fixation by cyanobacteria. delta N-15(SES) was higher in winter in the heated mesocosms and its dynamics was linked with that of NH4-N, whereas delta N-15(PER) showed a stronger association with NO3-N delta N-15(SES) demonstrated a positive relationship with mean monthly temperature, indicating less isotope fractionation among autotrophs when production increased. 5. delta C-13(SES) was lowest in the enriched mesocosms during winter, whereas delta C-13(PER) did not differ between nutrient treatments. delta C-13(SES) and delta C-13(PER) were positively related to pH, likely reflecting a pH-induced differential access to dissolved carbon species in the primary producers. The positive delta C-13-temperature relationship suggested less fractionation of CO2 and HCO3- and/or larger use of HCO3- at higher temperatures. 6. The C:N ratios varied seasonally and the differences between the enriched and unenriched mesocosms were stronger for seston than for periphyton. Particularly, the C:N-SES ratios did not indicate deficiencies in N as opposed to the C: N-PER ratios, supporting the observed changes in delta N-15 and suggesting that seston and periphyton have access to different sources of nutrients. We did not observe any clear effect of temperature warming on the C:N ratios. 7. Our study provides evidence of strong seasonality in the isotopic composition and C:N ratios of seston and periphyton across nutrient and temperature levels; also, we identified several factors that are likely to modulate the strength and variability in stable isotopes values and stoichiometry of sestonic and periphytic communities under these scenarios.

Although the underestimated (i.e. including only surface runoff, river inflows and precipitation) yearly TP loading is equal to or higher than the permissible value, the lakes have maintained their mesotrophic features for 20 to 30 years. P sorption to the allochthonous inorganic material as well as decalcification processes in the lakes are probably responsible for this situation, as there is a strong difference between the chemical content of supplying waters and lake waters and as there is a considerable enrichment of P on sestonic particles. As a consequence of the low bio-availability of P, the midsummer amount of chlorophyll a is lower than predicted from the "TP-chlorophyll-a" relation found for harmoniously eutrophicating (i.e. P-limited) lakes.																			0020-9309						1990	75	4					447	459		10.1002/iroh.19900750403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750403													WOS:A1990FR60200002

Future planning for infrastructure and resource allocation requires a scientifically based knowledge of hydrodynamics of the lakes under a changing climate. Green Bay has a long history of excessive algal production and hypoxia, and evidence shows that it has been getting worse in recent decades due to longer summer stratification and warmer climate. This research aims to investigate the effect of climate change on hydrodynamic behavior of Green Bay, which is crucial in future water quality and biogeochemical studies. Downscaled regional climate change data for mid-century conditions from Global Climate Models (GCM) was used as input to a hydrodynamic model. Model predictions of the circulation and thermal regime in the bay were analyzed under six climate change scenarios, namely the 90%, 50%, and 10% percentile rank increments in summer temperature and two emissions scenarios. The results show important changes in lake hydrodynamic regimes, in particular temperature patterns in the southern Green Bay, including the EPA, the area of concern (AOC). The outcome of this research provides a procedure that can be used by researchers and managers to investigate climate change effects in other coastal areas in the Great Lakes region.

Hypolimnetic oxygenation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Since the mid-20th century, oxygen status at the sedimentwater interface (SWI) has been implicated in regulating lake internal phosphorus loading. In deeper lakes, summer hypolimnetic oxygen depletion may thus play a critical role in phosphorus cycling and lake trophic status. Hypolimnetic aeration (HA) has been utilized for more than 4 decades to prevent development of anoxia, decrease internal phosphorus load, and enhance fisheries. Most recently, interest has shifted to hypolimnetic oxygenation (HO) for potential performance and economic advantages. In Newman Lake, hypolimnetic oxygenation was initiated in 1992 when the first lake application of downflow contact bubble oxygenation (Speece Cone technology) was installed. Oxygenation at Newman has reduced growing season Nurnberg Anoxic Factors (AF) from a range of about 3060 d to <10 d. We propose that differences in predicted versus observed AF based on phosphorus may be utilized to assess lake restoration performance. Newman Lake has demonstrated the importance of operating the system at full capacity, as lower oxygen delivery rates do not produce proportional hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, as well as other insights into HO system sizing and design.

We recorded the changes in waterbird abundance for two consecutive wintering seasons, October-March (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), in four wetlands of Bankura and Purulia district, West Bengal, India, on Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. The monthly variation in the water parameters, along with total guano and nutrient loadings by waterbirds, were evaluated during the study. Waterbird species varied from 37 to 61 in these wetlands. Guano loading in the study tenure ranged from 50.2 to 2979.1 kg month-1, depending on the wetland resources and the abundance of waterbird species. In most cases, total guano loading showed significant positive correlations with total N and P loading and, consequently, NO3 and PO4 concentrations in water. In all four wetlands, guano and nutrients added by herbivorous waterbirds were significantly higher than carnivorous and omnivorous waterbirds due to the much higher abundance of herbivorous waterbirds. Linear regression analyses showed that the abundance of the wintering waterbird community significantly impacted the nitrate and phosphate availability in most of the sites. Sustainable management of these wetlands depends on the delicate balance of guanotrophic nutrient enrichment and habitat fitness to attract migratory waterbirds.

Setting critical nutrient values for ditches using the eutrophication model PCDitch	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Critical nutrient loads to prevent duckweed dominance loads in polder ditches were assessed using the eutrophication model PCDitch. In this article the ecological target was set at 50% duckweed coverage. This may be very high for ditches with a nature function, but is not unreasonable for ditches in agricultural areas, with upwelling nutrient rich groundwater, run-off. and drainage. Since the change from a ditch with submersed vegetation to duckweed coverage is often a sudden shift, the choice of the amount of duckweed coverage does not influence the calculated loading very much. The main topic of this paper is to present a method to calculate critical loads of nutrients when ecological targets have been set. Sediment type, residence time and water depth influenced the critical loading rates. The calculated critical phosphorus load ranged from 1.8 to 10.2 g P m(-2) year(-1,) while the calculated critical nitrogen load stretched from 12.1 to 43.8 g N m(-2) year(-1). The concentration ranges that were derived from the loading rate were 0.19-0.42 mg P l(-1) and 1.3-3.3 mg N l(-1). Since PCDitch does not distinguish between Lemna spp. and Azolla spp., no definite conclusions were drawn concerning the effects of nitrogen reduction. In a model situation a pristine ditch was loaded with phosphorus, which resulted into complete duckweed coverage during summer within a few years. When reducing the phosphorus load, it took 10 years before the original situation was reached again. Dredging would accelerate the process of recovery significantly, because the water depth would increase and the phosphorus release from the sediments in summer would decrease.

As prices fell between 2011 and 2016, rare earths receded from public view, but less visibly, they became a major focus of innovative activity in companies, government laboratories, and universities. Geoscientists worked to better understand the resource base and improve our knowledge about mineral deposits that can be mines in the future. Process engineers carried out research that is making primary production and recycling more efficient. Materials scientists and engineers searched for substitutes that require fewer or no rare earths while providing properties comparable or superior to those of existing materials. As a result, even though global supply chains are not significantly different now than they were before the market disruption, the innovative activity motivated by the disruption will likely have far-reaching, if unpredictable, consequences for supply chains of rare earths in the future.																			1543-5938		978-0-8243-2341-7				2016	41						199	222		10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085700													WOS:000398214100008

Sediment suspension by burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp., Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Burrowing and ventilation activities of benthic invertebrates can influence water column turbidity, nutrient concentrations, and possibly oxygen balance of lakewide ecosystems. In laboratory experiments, we determined rates of bioturbation-induced suspension of fine Lake Erie sediments caused by the burrowing mayfly Hexagenia of various sizes (lengths 13-28 mm) and multiple densities (70-1, 111 larvae/m(2)) and water temperatures (10-25 degrees C). Larvae were inoculated into 2-L jars containing Lake Erie sediment and water. Bioturbation and sediment settling rates were independently estimated from sediment concentrations in water, measured twice daily for 14-18 d. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate sediment suspension rate for each jar (flux, mg/L/h). Logarithmic transformations of size, density, and temperature best described sediment flux. Separate experiments demonstrated that flux was unaffected by sediment depth, but did vary by sediment type, which was related to location from which Lake Erie sediment had been collected. Sediment suspension rates increased as food became depleted. Sediment suspension by pre-emergent (25 mm long) larvae at densities and water temperature typical for late spring in western Lake Erie (400 larvae/m(2) at 22 degrees C) averaged 12 g/m(2)/h. Although this level of bioturbation by Hexagenia larvae in western Lake Erie likely contributes only a small fraction of the basinwide annual sediment load, sediment suspension is possibly an important epibenthic source of nutrients and sediment-associated contaminants during spring. Such concentrations would exceed the clearance capacity of dreissenid mussels and may partially explain why dreissenids have not become abundant in soft sediments of the western basin.

The 2 sampling areas were selected to represent areas of high (West site) and low (East site) current sediment accumulation rates, based on distance from a perennially discharging stream. Modem (post settlement and land clearing) sediment accumulation rates were calculated using Pb-210 and Cs-137 on bulk sediment samples from 2 cores from each site. Two additional cores were collected from each site for radiocarbon analysis of twig cellulose with the assumption that most twigs in the sediment within the forested fringe fell from overhead and are contemporaneous with the sediment. Only the West site, however, yielded sufficient identifiable twig material for analysis. Modem sediment accumulation rates based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 fall between 0.2-0.4 cm/yr at the East site, and 0.7-1.3 cm/yr at the West site (nearest the stream inlet), with approximate agreement between the Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods. Modem sediment accumulation rate based on bomb-pulse C-14 activity of twigs from cores from the West site is approximately 1.0 cm/yr, in agreement with the Pb-210 and Cs-137 results. Historic sediment accumulation rates were estimated at the West site using twigs from deeper intervals with pre-bomb C-14 activity. Sediment covering approximately 1000 yr of pre-settlement, sediment accumulation exhibited evidence of minor bioturbation or in-washing of reworked material, but with a clearly lower accumulation rate of less than 0.1 cm/yr.

Here, we characterize how water temperature differs between alpine lakes with and without direct glacier influence on seasonal and diurnal timescales. Using high temporal resolution monitoring of temperature in 4 lakes located in a catchment influenced by glacier retreat, we reported unexpectedly high surface temperatures, even in proglacial lakes located 2600 ma.s.l. Cold glacier meltwater and low nighttime air temperatures caused a distinct diurnal pattern of water temperature in the water column of glacier-influenced lakes. Precipitation onto glacier surfaces apparently leads to rapid cooling of the glacier-fed lakes and disrupts the thermal stratification with several mixing events during the summer. Taken together, these mechanisms contribute to the unique seasonal and diurnal dynamics of glacier-influenced lakes that contrast with the typical dimictic pattern of clear alpine lakes and represent an example of discontinuous cold polymictic lake type. This work contributes to the basic description of how climate and meteorology affect the physical properties of an increasingly common lake type.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Peter, Hannes/0000-0001-9021-3082; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					45	54		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1294346								28690780					WOS:000405859800006

The concentrations of the major ions varied significantly in the five environmental matrices. Generally, the mean concentrations of most ions are in the order of lake water > swamp water > stream water > precipitation > snow. Rock weathering is the dominant process controlling the chemical compositions of the stream and swamp waters, with carbonate weathering being the primary source of the dissolved ions. The Nam Co lake water is characterized by high Na+ concentration and extremely low Ca2+ concentration relative to other ions, resulting from evapoconcentration and chemical precipitation within the lake. Comparison with the water chemistry of other lakes over the Tibetan Plateau indicated that Nam Co is located in a transition area between non-saline lakes and highly saline lakes. The relatively low concentration of total dissolved solids is possibly due to the abundant inflow of glacial meltwater and relatively high annual precipitation.

These features result from karst development related to the presence of a tectonically affected dome of Triassic evaporite rocks, mainly gypsum. Gypsum karstification has operated since the Pliocene, and the present-day geomorphological appearance of the area indicates an advanced, mature stage of karst development. Signs of this maturity include the widespread occurrence of large depressions, many of which are water-filled, forming lakes, the occasional presence of gypsum hills in the form of monadnocks,a thick " coating" of residual sediments largely isolating the karstic gypsum substrate from pre cipitation and surface wa ters, and the frag mentary pattern of a degraded river network. The karst character of the relief is largely "camou flaged" by clastic terrigenous and residual deposits of con siderable thickness which cover the gypsum and form a caprock. At the present stage, the caprock is being strongly reshaped and eroded. Chemi cal analyses show a mean dissolved gypsum content of 1.9 g/l and mean dissolved NaCl content of 0.4 g/l. The mean flow rate of subaqueous springs is calculated as 1.84 m3/s. The density of gypsum is 2.3, and that of rock salt is 2.17, thus the total volume of gypsum dissolved each year is 47,420 m3 and of rock salt 10,680 m3, making a total volume of dissolved material re leased by the subaqueous springs in one year of 58,100 m3.

Biomass (wet weight) was monitored from April 1995 to August 1996. This period is characterised by the transition from a dry year to a rainy year. So, composition and dynamics of phytoplankton are analysed, and related to environmental factors. In 1995 cyanobacteria dominated the algal communities; Microcystis aeruginosa represented more than 99 % of the total biomass. In 1996, phytoplankton was more diversified and constituted of a centric diatom (Cyclotella ocellata) and chlorococcals (Crucigenia apiculata, Scenedesmus ecornis, Oocystis lacustris...). In summer, M. aeruginosa appeared again and dominated the algal communities. Environmental factors (climate, water composition and exogenic inputs) seem to control appreciably the phytoplankton succession in El Kansera lake-reservoir.																			0003-4088						1999	35	3					155	166																WOS:000082941000001

Five years of field hydrographic research in the Large Aral Sea (2002-2006)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The paper is intended to provide a summarizing account of hydrographic research activities on the Large Aral Sea since 2002. To date of the writing (August, 2006), 6 field surveys have been accomplished, some of which consisted of separate legs covering different parts of the lake. The 3D thermohaline structure was investigated by means of surface-to-bottom profiling from motor boats at various hydrographic stations. In a part of the cruises, direct observations of water velocity and lake surface height were also conducted from mooring stations at specific locations. The measurements were accompanied by water sampling and collection of meteorological data. Over the period of the observations, the surface salinity in the western, relatively deep basin has increased from about 82 g.kg(-1) in November 2002 to over 99 g.kg(-1) in March 2006. Because the lake surface level remained nearly constant during this period, spanning only slightly between 30.1 and 30.7 m above the ocean level, and the fluvial and groundwater inputs of salts are likely negligible at the temporal scale of a few years, this continuing salinity build-up in the western basin must be associated with water exchanges with the shallow and saltier eastern basin. In the latter, salinity has decreased from tip to 160 g.kg-1 as previously reported for 2002 [Mirabdullaev, I.M., I.M. Joldasova, Z.A. Mustafaeva, S. Kazakhbaev, S.A. Lyubimova, and B.A. Tashmukhamedov, 2004. Succession of ecosystems of the Aral Sea during its transition from oligohaline to polyhaline waterbody. J. Marine Systems, 47(1-4), 101-108.] to only about 130 g-kg(-1) in 2005. The denser eastern basin water sinking down the slope of the western trench is responsible for enhanced vertical stratification observed in 2002 and 2003. Such stratification greatly damped vertical mixing, which resulted in hypoxia and sulfide contamination in the bottom layer. However, the water column was ventilated in spring of 2004, presumably, following deep winter convection, thus suggesting that stratification and hypoxia are intermittent rather than permanent features. A recently formed deep (up to 7 in) channel has been discovered in the otherwise shallow strait between the two basins, presumably associated with erosion of the silty bottom by currents. This means that the expectations of imminent separation of the two basins must be revisited. Water velocity values 20-50 cm.s(-1) have been observed in the channel. The lake surface level in the western basin responded energetically to wind-controlled inter-basin flow through the strait. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal Evolution of the Subglacial Hydrologic System Modified by Supraglacial Lake Drainage in Western Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The impact of summer surface melt on Greenland Ice Sheet dynamics is modulated by the state of the subglacial hydrologic system. Studies of ice motion indicate that efficiency of the subglacial system increases over the melt season, decreasing the sensitivity of ice motion to surface melt inputs. However, the behavior of the subglacial hydrologic system is complex and some characteristics are still poorly constrained. Here we investigate the coevolution of subglacial hydrology and ice motion in the Pakitsoq region of western Greenland during the 2011 melt season. We analyze measurements from 11 Global Positioning System stations, from which we derive ice velocity, longitudinal strain rates, and basal uplift, alongside observations of surface ablation and supraglacial lake drainages. We observe ice acceleration after the onset of local surface melting, followed by gradual ice deceleration, consistent with increasing subglacial efficiency. In the study area, supraglacial lake drainages cooccur with a change in regional strain rate patterns and ice deceleration, suggesting that lake drainages contribute to rapid subglacial reorganization. At lower ice surface elevations (below 900m above sea level), ice motion is correlated with both total basal uplift and its rate of change, while at higher elevations (900-1,100m above sea level), ice motion correlated only with the basal uplift rate. This pattern suggests that continued cavity growth or subglacial sediment dynamics may be important in the apparent increase in subglacial drainage efficiency at higher elevations in the ablation zone. Our results further suggest that transient subglacial behavior is important in the seasonal evolution of ice motion. Plain Language Summary Each summer, the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet experience intense surface melting. This meltwater is routed over the surface in supraglacial streams and stored in supraglacial lakes, but eventually reaches the bed of the ice sheet via crevasses and moulins. The interaction between this meltwater and the overlying ice causes changes to the subglacial hydrologic system, which subsequently causes changes in ice motion. Here we use measurements from 11 Global Positioning System stations, alongside observations of surface melt rates and supraglacial lake drainages, to improve our understanding of the subglacial hydrologic system. In our study area, supraglacial lake drainages tend to cooccur with slowdowns in ice motion, suggesting that the rapid drainage of these large volumes of water can alter the subglacial hydrologic system, allowing it to more readily transmit meltwater. Our observations also indicate that at high elevations, the seasonal pattern of ice motion is controlled by small changes over large regions, either in sediments or in pockets of water on the downstream side of bedrock bumps, not necessarily by the formation of large subglacial channels. These findings suggest that current models of the subglacial system need modifications to include the physics associated with supraglacial lake drainages and small-scale processes.					; Lüthi, Martin/AAA-3668-2021; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017; Neumann, Thomas/JLL-4672-2023; Catania, Ginny/B-9787-2008	Luthi, Martin Peter/0000-0003-4419-8496; Hawley, Robert/0000-0001-8466-0839; Schild, Kristin/0000-0003-3953-5355; Catania, Ginny/0000-0002-7561-5902													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2018	123	6					1479	1496		10.1029/2017JF004585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004585													WOS:000438207500015

Here, multi-decadal profiles of water temperatures, trophic state, and local climate from 345 temperate lakes are combined with data on lake geomorphology and watershed characteristics to identify controls of the relative rates of temperature change in water (WT) and air (AT) during summer. We show that differences in local climate (AT, wind speed, humidity, irradiance), land cover (forest, urban, agriculture), geomorphology (elevation, area/depth ratio), and water transparency explain >30% of the difference in rate of lake heating compared to that of the atmosphere. Importantly, the rate of lake heating slows as air warms (P < 0.001). Clear, cold, and deep lakes, especially at high elevation and in undisturbed catchments, are particularly responsive to changes in atmospheric temperature. We suggest that rates of surface water warming may decline relative to the atmosphere in a warmer future, particularly in sites already experiencing terrestrial development or eutrophication.					; Zhou, Jian/HHS-9262-2022; Wang, Xiwen/KXR-5967-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Zhang, Yibo/JEO-8465-2023	Zhou, Jian/0000-0001-8001-1268; Qin, Boqiang/0000-0003-3977-4903; Rose, Kevin/0000-0002-1292-9381; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512														2041-1723				OCT 16	2023	14	1							6503	10.1038/s41467-023-42262-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42262-x								37845203					WOS:001156991100008

The deep saline Na-Cl reservoir at 143 degrees C shows affinity with the shallow geothermal water from the "active" Asal rift. Asal water is a diluted and recycled seawater component with the major cation composition obliterated by equilibration with Stratoid basalt. Locally, the deep reservoir is differentiated in term of recharge, and re-equilibration with rocks and mixing. In particular, two spring groups reveal contributions from evaporites typical of the "passive" graben setting of the Afar. A model on S-34/S-32 and O-18/O-16 demonstrates the isotope imprint of magmatic SO2 dis-proportionation on dissolved and solid sulfate, whose values probably persists in a sedimentary environment without trace of seawater. On the other hand a seawater signature, modified by mixing and secondary fractionation effects, is partially maintained according to the boron isotope composition (up to +27.4%.). Temperature estimation in low-enthalpy geothermal reservoirs is notoriously difficult, especially where mixing with fluids of differing genesis and/or conduction cooling take place. From a geothermometric point of view, the multi method approach followed in this study (up-to-date theoretical and thermodynamic equations, ad-hoc silica geothermometers inferred from local rocks, checking of the results on a O-18 alpha(sulfate-water) vs. temperature diagram) provides some insights and perspectives on how to tackle the problem.

Medusae were collected for two experiments involving the prey items Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia magna and Daphnia lumholtzi, and for a third experiment in unfiltered pond water containing natural densities of in situ fauna. Medusa presence significantly increased prey mortality for all three species in the first two experiments. We found that B. longirostris and D. lumholtzi were significantly more likely to be consumed once killed, compared to D. magna. Daphnia magna was killed at a high rate, but was not consumed. When placed in whole pond water containing a natural complement of zooplankton, medusae were found to significantly alter community abundance by reducing the population abundance of many of the common zooplankton species present, including the rotifer Ascomorpha spp., copepod adults and nauplii, and B. ongirostris. We argue that C. sowerbii presence has the potential to significantly alter zooplankton communities and, therefore, aquatic food webs, via both direct predation (rotifers, small cladocera, copepods) and incidental mortality (larger zooplankton and small/larval fish).																			0142-7873					DEC	2008	30	12					1323	1327		10.1093/plankt/fbn093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbn093													WOS:000261170400001

The organic carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased by 10 and 20% with depth, respectively, whereas particulate phosphorus fluxes showed an increase of 114% with depth. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N of organic matter showed large seasonal changes ranging between -40 and -22 parts per thousand for C and 4 and 16 parts per thousand for N. The variations in delta(13)C can be attributed to variations in primary productivity level, changes in the carbonate chemistry, and isotope discrimination during photosynthesis. Very heavy nitrogen isotope compositions of organic matter in winter may indicate an external source of organic N. Comparison of the C and N isotope composition of organic matter in the top sediment with the sediment traps indicated that the observed flux increases with depth were due to a combination of lateral organic matter transport,sediment reworking, and possibly a contribution of allochthonous organic matter.

Angling-Induced Impacts on Recruitment and Contributions to Reproduction in Florida Bass	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Black basses Micropterus spp. are the focus of extensive management efforts throughout North America, where they support a multibillion-dollar recreational sport fishery. Harvest rates in many bass fisheries have declined in recent decades, yet a growing number of studies have proposed that catch-and-release angling practices, such as bed-fishing in which anglers intentionally target bass while the fish are defending their nests, can decrease individual reproductive success. In response, management agencies have restricted fishing during the spawning period in some regions. We evaluated the impacts of catch-and-release bed-fishing on Florida Bass M. salmoides floridanus nest success, reproductive success, production of fall recruits, and the number of parents that contributed to reproduction. Eighteen replicate populations simulating natural Florida lakes were established, and ponds were assigned either a bed-fishing (n = 10) or a control treatment (n = 8). Snorkel surveys were conducted throughout the spawning period to track nest formation and nesting success rates, and 10 months after establishment all ponds were drained, recruits counted, and fin clips collected for genetic parentage analysis. A series of candidate generalized linear mixed models were compared using Akaike's information criterion and likelihood ratio tests to assess the relative importance of fishing treatment and year, along with other relevant variables in predicting nest success, recruitment, and reproductive success. We observed significant reductions in nest success rates (z = -2.13, P = 0.03) but not recruitment levels (z = -1.31, P = 0.19), in populations that were bed fished relative to control ponds. Capture history poorly predicted individual reproductive success and the number of adults that contributed to fall recruitment did not differ by treatment (chi(2) = 0.06, P = 0.81). Results from this study indicated that bed-fishing practices may have some impacts on individual nest success but did not influence recruitment or overall reproductive success of Florida Bass at the population level.

In the present research we specifically investigated the trophic transfer of these organochlorine contaminants (OC) through a pelagic food web of a deep lake in Northern Italy (Lake Como) over time. Zooplankton and fish were sampled each season of a year and OC concentrations and the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios were measured. By using stable isotopes, the direct trophic relationship between pelagic zooplankton and zooplanktivorous fish was confirmed for Alosa agone only in summer. Based on this result, the biomagnification factor normalized on the trophic level (BMFTL) for organic contaminants was calculated. BMFTL values were within the range 0.9-1.9 for DDT isomers and 1.6-4.9 for some PCB congeners (PCB 95, PCB 101, PCB 149, PCB 153, PCB 138 - present both in zooplankton and in fish and representing >60% of the PCB contamination), confirming the biomagnification of these compounds in one of the two zooplanktivorous fish species of the lake.

Spatio-temporal variation of nitrate sources to Lake Winnipeg using N and O isotope (δ15N, δ18O) analyses	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into Lake Winnipeg, Canada, from watershed sources have increased during the last decades, contributing to eutrophication. These nutrient N inputs include loadings from agriculture (inorganic fertilizer and animal waste) and urban sources (wastewater discharge from sewage treatment plants). The aim of this study was to evaluate the sources and seasonal patterns of dissolved nitrates in two major contributors to Lake Winnipeg; the Assiniboine and Red rivers. The relative contribution of nitrate sources was estimated using Bayesian isotope mixing models incorporating delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of dissolved nitrate. Overall, delta N-15 values of nitrate in the rivers ranged from -2 % to +20 %, and delta O-18 values ranged from -20 % to +20 %, which indicated variable contribution of nitrate sources, depending on the river reach and seasonal period of sampling. The results indicated that nitrate in the Assiniboine River originated up to 62 % from waste or municipal sources (i.e. manure and/or waste water discharge), whereas ca. 40 % of nitrate in the Red River originated predominantly from inorganic agricultural fertilizers. These different source contributions were temporally variable, with a decrease in fertilizer loading following spring snowmelt. We found higher proportions of inorganic fertilizers in the Assiniboine River watershed during flooding, which has relevant implications for water nutrient management in response to stochastic flooding events.

Volcanic and sedimentary facies of the Huka Group arc-basin sequence, Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Field, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Detailed facies analyses of intra-arc basin stratigraphy provide spatial and temporal insights into the nature and timing of past volcanic, sedimentary and tectonic events. Rift and caldera basins hosting lakes in the central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) continental arc preserve a sequence of locally and regionally sourced volcanic deposits and interbedded lacustrine sediments. A series of new continuous core samples from Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Fields in the TVZ intersecting thick Huka Group stratigraphy has provided a unique opportunity to study c. 300ka of local arc volcanism, sedimentary processes and ancient surface environments. Facies analysis is utilised on 11 cored wells from across Wairakei-Tauhara, including a newly defined Huka Group Reference Section well (WKM15). Interpreted facies identify that the Huka Group commenced with a large ignimbrite (Waiora Ignimbrite Member) emplaced onto faulted relief covered by a pre-existing ancient lake, Lake Huka. Graded volcaniclastic facies, lavas and sediments comprising the Waiora Volcaniclastics Member then accumulated in the basins over the next c. 100ka. A spatially variable switch from volcaniclastic (Waiora Volcaniclastics Member) to lacustrine siltstones and sandstones (Huka Falls Formation) deposition then followed in Lake Huka. Excluding an intra-lake phreatomagmatic eruption (Middle Huka Falls Formation), these lacustrine sediments reflect a c. 200ka local pyroclastic hiatus. Late Huka Group deposition became gradually more fluvial as rivers prograded marginal areas of the lake until its destruction by the 25.4ka Oruanui eruption. The drill core samples provide new complete and detailed insights into processes and environments associated with the Huka Group. These enhance our understanding of the geological history at Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Fields and contribute to our knowledge of the ancient processes that occurred during evolution of the TVZ.																			0028-8306	1175-8791				JUN	2016	59	2					236	256		10.1080/00288306.2015.1102748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2015.1102748													WOS:000378634200002

Challenges in constraining pluvial events and hominin activity: Examples of ESR dating molluscs from the Western Desert, Egypt	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY					13th International Conference on Luminescence and Electron Spin Resonance Dating (LED)	JUL 10-14, 2011	Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Math, Torun, POLAND		Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Math			Receiving <0.1 mm/y of precipitation, Egypt's hyperarid Western Desert, today lacks naturally occurring surface water. Artesian spring deposits, tufa deposited by springs and carbonate-rich silty lacustrine sediment attest that oases in the Western Desert had surface water during the Pleistocene. Paleolithic artefacts, fossil ungulate teeth, and snails occurring within the Pleistocene deposits and dotting the surface record times when higher rainfall and/or groundwater tables during pluvial events allowed surface water to exist in wetlands, small ponds and lakes, enabling hominin habitation. Archaeological finds ranging from Early to Later Stone Age (ESA-LSA) occur in gravel lags, within sedimentary deposits, and on the older geomorphic surfaces. Near Kharga, large tufa deposits ranging from a few hectares to more than 10 km(2) in area, such as Matana and Medauwara, dot the edge of the Libyan Plateau. Molluscs were dated using standard ESR protocols. To test for reworked fossils, multiple samples from a single sample were dated independently. In some units at Medauwara, multiple gastropod populations from different times have been preserved, while others appear to only preserve a single population. To see the effects of the cosmic dose rate on ESR ages, ages were calculated using zero cosmic dose rate, the full modern cosmic dose rate, and time-averaged cosmic and sedimentary dose rates. For gastropods from Matana, no significant difference in ESR ages resulted from different cosmic dose rate assumptions. Therefore, at Matana 2, the shells dated at 27.7 +/- 1.9 assuming time-averaged external dose rates, while at Matana 3, they averaged 65.1 +/- 4.1 ka, suggesting that water was present for hominin use at times during OIS 2 and 4.

An alternative approach to remote lake monitoring with MODIS 250m imagery	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We evaluated use of MODIS 250m imagery for remote lake monitoring in Maine. Despite limited spectral resolution (visible red and near infrared bands), the twice daily image capture has a potential advantage over conventionally used, often cloudy Landsat imagery (16day interval) when short time windows are of interest. We analyzed 364 eligible (100 ha) Maine lakes during late summer (Aug-early Sep) 2000-2011. The red band was strongly correlated with natural log-transformed Secchi depth (SD), and the addition of ancillary lake and watershed variables explained some variability in ln(SD) (R-2 = 0.68-0.85; 9 models). Weak spectral resolution and variable lake conditions limited accurate lake monitoring to relatively productive periods in late summer, as indicated by inconsistent, sometimes weak regressions during June and July when lakes were clearer and less stable (R-2 = 0.19-0.74; 8 models). Additionally, SD estimates derived from 2 sets of concurrent MODIS and Landsat imagery generally did not agree unless Landsat imagery (30m) was resampled to 250m, likely owing to various factors related to scale. Average MODIS estimates exceeded those of Landsat by 0.35 and 0.49m on the 2 dates. Overall, MODIS 250m imagery are potentially useful for remote lake monitoring during productive periods when Landsat data are unavailable; however, analyses must occur when algal communities are stable and well-developed, are biased toward large lakes, may overestimate SD, and accuracy may be unreliable without non-spectral lake predictors.																			1040-2381					JUN 1	2013	29	2					89	98		10.1080/10402381.2013.778926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2013.778926													WOS:000320082900001

Quantifying seasonal variations in space use within the home range of Burbot	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveAdvances in acoustic telemetry have assisted biologists in understanding migration patterns, space use, survival, and the effects of human influences on aquatic species. Using fine-scale positioning, fisheries managers can quantify home range size fluctuations throughout the year and even identify spawning areas. Burbot Lota lota population dynamics have been studied across their range, while movement dynamics have been briefly investigated. Our objective was to assess seasonal variations of Burbot space use using estimations of home range size with an attempt to infer spawn timing.MethodsThirty-two acoustic-tagged Burbot were used to study home range size in Bad Medicine Lake, Minnesota, from April 2019 to June 2020.ResultFemale estimated home range size was significantly larger than that of males. Estimated home range size increased following ice formation in December and continued through March. Average home range estimates were largest in the middle of March and smallest in April, assumed to be caused by spawning and postspawn behaviors, respectively.ConclusionThe results suggest that Burbot movement increased during the winter months, which may cause potential increases in vulnerability during spawning. High exploitation rates are possible in situations where spawning and feeding Burbot encounter elevated angling pressure. Future research should continue to assess the movement dynamics and potential site fidelity of Burbot populations by monitoring spawning grounds and if the same areas are used year after year. The results of this study improve the knowledge of areas used by Burbot in lakes, which can assist with management of Burbot in Bad Medicine Lake. Furthermore, we highlighted how Burbot movement increased during spawn timing, which could contribute to increased encounters with anglers. This study provides the first explanation of the year-round spatial analysis of Burbot in a closed lake system. We found that Burbot space use increased during winter following ice-on and peaked in mid-March, which is assumed to be associated with reproduction. Overall, female space use was larger than that of males across the study period.Impact statement																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2024	44	2								10.1002/nafm.10980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10980		MAR 2024											WOS:001193922600001

Participation takes many forms, and can involve influencing policy, contributing to cultural outputs and enjoying cultural activities. This paper critically examines the literature and discourse underpinning the endangerment/participation axis and presents a case study of heritage participation in the English Lake District. In order to ground critique in empirical investigation, the case study focusses on the practice of a particular fell shepherd, whose participation in heritage is not motivated by endangerment.

Target antibiotics in surface water of Lake Guchenghu, adjacent streams, and crab ponds were detected seasonally. The results showed that erythromycin-H2O (1.60-2450 ng/L), sulfadiazine (ND-654 ng/L), and florfenicol (ND-919 ng/L) were the predominant antibiotics in Lake Guchenghu. The concentrations of antibiotics in Lake Guchenghu Basin showed obvious seasonal variation, with the highest concentration in summer. In general, the concentrations of antibiotics in crab ponds and streams were higher than those in the lake and spatial distributions of antibiotics were affected by pollution sources. The types and origins of antibiotics indicated that wastewater from ponds was the main source of antibiotics in the lake. Risk assessment suggested that as individual compound, erythromycin-H2O and clarithromycin posed a high risk to algae while other compounds might pose low or no risk. The mixture of antibiotics may pose a high risk to aquatic organisms in Lake Guchenghu. Overall, our study revealed the occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of antibiotics in Lake Guchenghu, which was related with crab culturing.

They are connected with the Apulian wetlands, an important network thanks of its central geographic position, between the east and west of the Mediterranean basin. Several species and habitats of European and international interest (Natura 2000 network, Ramsar list) are present in them. It plays a significant role as an area of stopover, wintering and breeding along the migratory routes of birds that cross the Mediterranean. The most interesting migratory and wintering species is the Numenius tenuirostris (slender-billed curlew), which is the bird most at risk of extinction in Europe. Moreover in the early 1990s The Phoenicopterus ruber (greater flamingo) has colonised the reserve in great number, around 6,000 today, making it the largest concentration of the species in mainland Italy. The Margherita di Savoia saltworks are entirely a man-made area, the characteristics of which (water levels, salinity) are preserved entirely due to sea salt production, which guarantees all the chemical and physical factors necessary for the survival of these habitats. It is also worth noting the type of production adopted in the saltworks, which makes it possible to recover the processing brine, thus eliminating one of the critical factors in the symbiotic relationship between salt production and environmental protection.																					978-960-86638-2-4				2006							15	24																WOS:000243968500002

Estimates of the N-fixing potential on a sediment dry-weight base were 10.9-112.1 ng g-1 h-1 or on an area basis were 45.3-99 ng m-2 h-1. The distribution of C2H2 reducing activity within the sediment paralleled the distribution of Kjeldahl N, total organic C, and microbial biomass and was inversely related to NH4+-N in interstitial water. A seasonal variation in the activity was observed in the top-most sediment strata, with the highest rates occurring during winter. Estimates of the total N input reveal that this is of little quantitiative importance compared to inputs of combined N from other sources.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	2					241	249		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516045													WOS:A1984TM67200012
J	NUGENT, C				NUGENT, C			THE ZAMBEZI RIVER - TECTONISM, CLIMATIC-CHANGE AND DRAINAGE EVOLUTION	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The longitudinal profile of the Zambezi River forms two concave-upwards sections, with their boundary at the Victoria Falls. This form has been ascribed to the process of pediplanation and the Victoria Falls identified as one of several knick points that have traversed the river since the breakup of Gondwanaland. An alternative model explains the river''s long profile by suggesting that the Upper and Middle Zambezi evolved as entirely separate river systems, which only joined together in comparatively recent times. The alluvial sequence of the Middle Zambezi is described and interpreted in terms of the latter hypothesis. The river capture event caused a change in grade and is marked by a deposit believed to recorded a cataclysmic flood. Capture is inferred to have resulted from overtopping of the lake that formed the end sink of the proto-Upper Zambezi, rather than from headward erosion of the proto-Middle Zambezi. This event is dated, from archaeological evidence, to the peak of the last interglacial, at the end of the Middle Pleistocene. Subsequent drainage diversions between the Middle Zambezi and the Kalahari are interpreted as the product of rifting of the Chobe Graben and aggradation of the Chobe Swamps. River capture by overtopping implies high rainfall over Central Southern Africa at the peak of the last interglacial, which is contrary to predictions that Africa''s rain belts then lay north of their modern mean positions. This anomaly is resolved by postulating a southern polar warming episode at that time and agrees with suggestions that the last interglacial was marked by large scale ablation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY	1990	78	1-2					55	69		10.1016/0031-0182(90)90204-K	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(90)90204-K													WOS:A1990DM42100003

In this study, we investigated the seasonal carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) and related environmental factors in 4 cascading reservoirs (Hong Jia Du, Dong Feng, Suo Feng Ying, and Wu Jiang Du) of Wujiang River, southwest China. The results showed that pCO(2) in the surface water of these reservoirs had obvious spatiotemporal changes and generally decreased from the riverine zone to the lacustrine zone in each reservoir. In summer, pCO(2) was highest downstream of the dam because of stratification and deep water discharge for hydropower generation, whereas pCO(2) was much lower in the surface water of the lacustrine zone because of carbon removal by photosynthesis. When water temperature was low, however, pCO(2) was higher in the surface water of the lacustrine zone because of respiration and organic decomposition. Among these reservoirs, only Suo Feng Ying had CO2 emissions higher than the average value of natural lakes. In addition, CO2 emission flux showed an exponentially negative relationship with hydraulic retention time of reservoirs, based on this work and other reports of reservoirs in the Yangtze River basin.

Mapping Arctic Bottomfast Sea Ice Using SAR Interferometry	REMOTE SENSING												Bottomfast sea ice is an integral part of many near-coastal Arctic ecosystems with implications for subsea permafrost, coastal stability and morphology. Bottomfast sea ice is also of great relevance to over-ice travel by coastal communities, industrial ice roads, and marine habitats. There are currently large uncertainties around where and how much bottomfast ice is present in the Arctic due to the lack of effective approaches for detecting bottomfast sea ice on large spatial scales. Here, we suggest a robust method capable of detecting bottomfast sea ice using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar interferometry. This approach is used to discriminate between slowly deforming floating ice and completely stationary bottomfast ice based on the interferometric phase. We validate the approach over freshwater ice in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada, and over sea ice in the Colville Delta and Elson Lagoon, Alaska. For these areas, bottomfast ice, as interpreted from the interferometric phase, shows high correlation with local bathymetry and in-situ ice auger and ground penetrating radar measurements. The technique is further used to track the seasonal evolution of bottomfast ice in the Kasegaluk Lagoon, Alaska, by identifying freeze-up progression and areas of liquid water throughout winter.					; Eriksson, Leif/A-8238-2013; Eriksson, Leif E.

To characterize the temporal variability of water quality in the dam lake, monitoring was conducted monthly for 2 years (January 2013-January 2015) at four sites. The relationship between the physicochemical parameters was evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the seasonal-variation evaluation of the environmental factors was conducted by principal component analysis (PCA). The water in the dam tended to be alkaline, with the highest pH=9.95 recorded in the spring of 2013. The dissolved oxygen levels varied between 2.58 and 11.61 mg L-1, the nitrates were low.

Mayfly ecology and distribution in the Mediterranean part of the Western Balkans are insufficiently investigated. Our study encompassed 9 sampling sites along the course of the Cetina River, the longest Mediterrranean river in Croatia, and 2 sites in the spring reach of its tributary, Ruda River. Mayflies were sampled monthly between August 2004 and August 2005. A total of 22 mayfly taxa were recorded, including 12 rare species. Due to the variety of available microhabitats and suitable physico-chemical water properties (e.g. water temperature), the highest mayfly richness was recorded in the lower reaches of the river. We discuss distribution and ecology of collected species, particularly the most abundant species (e.g. Baetis rhodani (Pictet, 1843) and Serratella ignita (Poda, 1761)) and the rare species (e.g. Siphlonurus croaticus Ulmer, 1920). One of the rare species collected, Caenis beskidensis Sowa, 1973, has a central and western European distribution and was hitherto not recorded in the Dinaric Western Balkan ecoregion. Morphologically variable specimens from the Rhithrogena group semicolorata were collected, and variability of the most important morphological characters is presented here. In order to resolve the taxonomical status we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (barcode region) of morphologically distinct specimens from the Cetina spring and another locality belonging to the Black Sea drainage (Bijela rijeka, Plitvice Lakes NP). Uncorrected p-distances within and between populations enabled us to associate all specimens to Rhithrogena braaschi Jacob, 1974. Moreover, in contrast to high morphological variability observed in this species, we infer low genetic differentiation of the mtCOI fragment in this species in the Dinaric Western Balkans.

J	Thompson, RS				Thompson, RS			Pliocene and early Pleistocene environments and climates of the western Snake River Plain, Idaho	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Sedimentological, palynological, and magnetic susceptibility data provide paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic information from a 989 ft (301 m) core of sediments from the upper Glenns Ferry and Bruneau Formations from near the town of Bruneau in Owyhee County, Idaho. Chronology is based on stratigraphic position, paleomagnetism, and biostratigraphic data, which collectively suggest a late Gauss Normal-Polarity Chron age for the Glenns Ferry sediments and a middle Matuyama Reversed-Polarity Chron age for the Bruneau sediments. A deep lake was present on the western Snake River Plain during the portions of the time represented by the Glenns Ferry Formation, and the mudstones of the lower half of the core were apparently deposited in this lake. The terminal regression of the Glenns Ferry lake may be represented in the Bruneau core by sandy mudstones and sands that overlie the deep-water mudstones. A cobble layer present in the core between the Glenns Ferry lake beds and those of the overlying Bruneau Formation may indicate through-flow by the ancestral Snake River. Palynological data from the Glenns Ferry sediments in the Bruneau core reveal a pollen flora similar to the modern regional pollen flora, with very rare occurrences of now-extirpated taxa common earlier in the Tertiary. Palynological data from the Pliocene portion of this core indicate conditions more moist than today, with cooler summers and perhaps warmer winters. Quasi-periodic fluctuations in coniferous pollen (primarily Pinus) versus arid steppe taxa (primarily Chenopodiaceae/Amaranrhus) indicate significant variations in moisture through the lower two-thirds of the Glenns Ferry portion of the core. Shorter wave-length fluctuations in magnetic susceptibility and (inversely) Artemisia may reflect variations in temperature or other unidentified climatic variables. The pollen spectra from the Bruneau Formation sediments in the Bruneau core are dominated by Artemisia and resemble those of the Wisconsinan glacial period on the Snake River Plain, and hence indicate cold and dry conditions during some portion of the early Pleistocene. The deep-water Glenns Ferry lacustrine episode appears to date between approximately 3.5 to 3.3 and 2.5 Ma, and thus occurred during the middle Pliocene period of warmer-than-modern global temperatures. Similar sustained wetter-than-present conditions occurred in the same age range at sites across the western U.S.A. from southern California and Arizona to northern California and Idaho. This moist period was apparently followed by an interval of regional arid conditions that persisted for several hundred thousand years.																			0377-8398					APR	1996	27	1-4					141	156		10.1016/0377-8398(95)00056-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-8398(95)00056-9													WOS:A1996UP07800010

Methane release and coastal environment in the East Siberian Arctic shelf	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					37th International Liege Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics/5th International Symposium on Gas Transfer at Water Surfaces	MAY 02-06, 2005	Univ Liege, Liege, BELGIUM		Univ Liege			In this paper we present 2 years of data obtained during the late summer period (September 2003 and September 2004) for the East Siberian Arctic shelf (ESAS). According to our data, the surface layer of shelf water was supersaturated up to 2500% relative to the present average atmospheric methane content of 1.85 ppm, pointing to the rivers as a strong source of dissolved methane which comes from watersheds which are underlain with permafrost. Anomalously high concentrations (up to 154 nM or 4400% supersaturation) of dissolved methane in the bottom layer of shelf water at a few sites suggest that the bottom layer is somehow affected by near-bottom sources. The net flux of methane from this area of the East Siberian Arctic shelf can reach up to 13.7 x 10(4) g CH4 km(-2) from plume areas during the period of ice free water, and thus is in the upper range of the estimated global marine methane release. Ongoing environmental change might affect the methane marine cycle since significant changes in the thermal regime of bottom sediments within a few sites were registered. Correlation between calculated methane storage within the water column and both integrated salinity values (r=0.61) and integrated values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (r=0.62) suggest that higher concentrations of dissolved methane were mostly derived from the marine environment, likely due to in-situ production or release from decaying submarine gas hydrates deposits. The calculated late summer potential methane emissions tend to vary from year to year, reflecting most likely the effect of changing hydrological and meteorological conditions (temperature, wind) on the ESAS rather than riverine export of dissolved methane. We point out additional sources of methane in this region such as submarine taliks, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost itself and decaying gas hydrates deposits. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recent climate warming drives ecological change in a remote high-Arctic lake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The high Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth, evidenced by extreme near-surface temperature increase in non-summer seasons, recent rapid sea ice decline and permafrost melting since the early 1990' s. Understanding the impact of climate change on the sensitive Arctic ecosystem to climate change has so far been hampered by the lack of time-constrained, high-resolution records and by implicit climate data analyses. Here, we show evidence of sharp growth in freshwater green algae as well as distinct diatom assemblage changes since similar to 1995, retrieved from a high-Arctic (80 degrees N) lake sediment record on Barentsoya (Svalbard). The proxy record approaches an annual to biennial resolution. Combining remote sensing and in-situ climate data, we show that this ecological change is concurrent with, and is likely driven by, the atmospheric warming and a sharp decrease in the length of the sea ice covered period in the region, and throughout the Arctic. Moreover, this research demonstrates the value of palaeoclimate records in pristine environments for supporting and extending instrumental records. Our results reinforce and extend observations from other sites that the high Arctic has already undergone rapid ecological changes in response to on-going climate change, and will continue to do so in the future.					; Lenaerts, Jan/D-9423-2012	Hoek, Wim/0000-0001-7313-100X; Lenaerts, Jan/0000-0003-4309-4011													2045-2322					MAY 1	2018	8								6858	10.1038/s41598-018-25148-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25148-7								29717176					WOS:000431114200037
J	French, HM; Demitroff, M				French, HM; Demitroff, M			Cold-climate origin of the enclosed depressions and wetlands ('spungs') of the Pine Barrens, southern New Jersey, USA	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												The 'frost-thaw' or thermokarst-lake-basin hypothesis, first invoked by P. E. Wolfe in 1953 to explain the enclosed depressions and shallow basins ('spungs') of southern New Jersey, is re-examined. The most probable explanation is that they formed in late Wisconsinan times as deflation hollows, or 'blowouts', when strong katabatic winds flowed southwards from the continental ice margin across the sparsely vegetated, tundra terrain of the Pine Barrens. Wedge structures and cryoturbation phenomena suggest the existence of either permafrost or deep seasonal frost, and imply mean annual air temperatures of between -0.5 degreesC and -6 degreesC. When the groundwater table rose in late-glacial times, the hollows became ponds or wetlands. These were utilized as early as 12,000 years ago by palaeoindian and early archaic cultures as hunting camp sites. Today, many of these wetlands are drying up as the regional water table falls in response to increased water usage from agriculture and urbanization.

However, little is known concerning the effects of different winds on the currents and further on ecological systems of these lakes. Therefore, synchronous meteorological and hydrological data were collected from Lake Taihu (China) during summer 2015. Time series analysis and stress calculations conducted to elucidate the basin-scale current field revealed frequent occurrence of a bilayer current mode, comprising a wind-driven surface current and bottom compensation current, under low or medium wind conditions. The main forcings of the lake currents are seasonal winds related to the East Asian monsoon, and the lake-land thermal contrast wind with 24-hr periodicity causes marked diurnal fluctuation. Inflows, outflows, the Coriolis force, and bottom frictional stress also make important contributions to the bilayer current mode, and weak temperature stratification can stabilize this mode. However, as wind speed increases, wind-driven surface currents can develop downward to form uniform currents throughout the water depth, and water temperature stratification is destroyed during typhoon-affected periods. During such short-term strong wind events, the current structure mainly adopts a monolayer current mode and the incidence of the bilayer current mode decreases substantially. The monolayer current mode causes a clockwise circulation and a basin-scale temporary oscillation with similar to 80-hr periodicity. The influences of the monsoon and lake-land thermal contrast wind on lake currents were masked by the pulse-like strong winds. Both modes can contribute to persistent cyanobacterial blooms in the northwest of Lake Taihu. Large lake currents profoundly influence the lake environmental characteristics and ecological attributes. However, little is known concerning about the current distribution in response to the different wind fields. Therefore, synchronous meteorological and hydrological data were observed in Lake Taihu during the summer of 2015. It was found that a bilayer current mode was frequently observed under condition of low wind speed. This current mode comprised a wind-driven surface current and bottom opposite compensation current. The main driving forces were the seasonal winds related to the East Asian monsoon and land-lake thermal contrast wind, inflow-outflow, the Coriolis force, and bottom frictional stress. A weak temperature stratification can stabilize this mode. However, wind-driven surface currents could develop downward trends with greater wind speeds to form uniform currents throughout the entire water column and the water temperature stratification was destroyed during typhoon-affected periods. During the monolayer current period, a clockwise circulation and a basin-scale temporary oscillation with a periodicity of similar to 80hr were observed. Both modes can contribute the persistent cyanobacterial blooms in the northwest region of Lake Taihu.

J	Jakobsen, BH; Fredskild, B; Pedersen, JBT				Jakobsen, Bjarne Holm; Fredskild, Bent; Pedersen, Jorn Bjarke Torp			Holocene changes in climate and vegetation in the Ammassalik area, East Greenland, recorded in lake sediments and soil profiles	GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												Holocene climatic, vegetational and environmental changes on the Ammassalik Island in SE Greenland (65.5 N and 37.5 W) have been studied in lake sediments and soil profiles. Based on the stratigraphy of sediments, geobiochemical charcteristics, pollen and other biological proxies. a history of the land is outlined. The overall and continued climatic cooling during the Holocene basically seems to be orbitally controlled and due to both decreasing annual and summer insulations. The very early Holocene, concurrent with and following the final postglacial melting of glaciers in the landscape, appears to have experienced to the warmest Holocene summer conditons, ice-free seas and limited snow covers, The climate situation seems to have been to a considerable extent based on internal regional meterorological processes and largely without strong and regular cyclonic impacts from lower latitudes. Generally decreasing insulation, a still colder landscape and near coastal sea, potentially further cooled by the negative albedo feedback from snow and ice, generally increase a gradient driven circulation of heat and moisture northwards in the western part of the North Atlantic, Counteracting this southerly influx of heat and moisture, will be the blocking effect of a snow and ice-covered region, resulting in decreasing precipitation and probably slightly increasing net radiation in landscapes. A framework and a climatic system are created to characterize the environmental changes of the latest 4-5 millenia. There has presumably been a continuous cooling trend interupted by both spells and somewhat longer periods of renewed and stronger southerly influxes, relatively warmer conditions, higher precipitation and less sea ice.																			0016-7223	1903-2471					2008	108	1					21	50		10.1080/00167223.2008.10649573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00167223.2008.10649573													WOS:000258625300003

As a hydrologically closed basin, the water budget of Lake Bosumtwi is extremely sensitive to changes in the precipitation/evapotranspiration balance. Lake Bosumtwi lies in the path of the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); hence, the lake is ideally situated to study monsoon variability in West Africa. Five distinctive magnetic mineral zones (A-E) were identified in the 11-m-long sediment cores that span the last 26,000 calendar years. Prior to 12 calendar (cal) ka, low concentrations of multidomain, high-coercivity magnetic minerals are present. Three prominent shifts towards very high concentrations of high-coercivity iron sulfide (greigite) magnetic minerals are centered at 12,470, 17,290, and 22,600 calendar years during the last glacial period (magnetic zones D1-3). Between 12 and 3.2 cal ka, there is an abrupt shift to moderately high concentrations of mixed multidomain and single-domain, low-coercivity minerals and an organic-rich sapropel lithology. Since 3.2 cal ka, the magnetic mineral parameters reveal a shift to increased amounts of high-coercivity magnetic minerals. These magnetic mineral zones document tropical climate variability on a variety of temporal scales. Glacial age sediments have a high-coercivity magnetic mineralogy due to increased aeolian dust transport from the Sahel to Lake Bosumtwi as well as postdepositional reductive diagenesis. During the last glacial period, the increased strength of Harmattan and North African continental trade winds, the southward depression of the ITCZ, and weakened summer monsoon strength resulted in increased regional aridity and greater dust flux out of Sahel source regions. The greigite-bearing D magnetic zones correspond to brief lowstands in the level of Lake Bosumtwi and likely represent periods of intensified aridity in West Africa. The D magnetic zones closely resemble the timing and duration of Heinrich events and suggest a hemispheric-scale climatic coupling between the tropics and poles. The well-documented African humid period (AHP) is characterized by abrupt shifts in magnetic parameters between 12 and 3.2 cal ka. Dust flux to Lake Bosumtwi is inferred to be very low during this humid interval due to the strengthening of the summer monsoon. Since 3.2 cal ka, the magnetic mineral parameters suggest increased aridity as compared to the AHP. This work demonstrates that the magnetic properties of Lake Bosumtwi sediment are a sensitive recorder of abrupt climate change of global significance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Trophic Conditions and Planktonic Processes of Semi-arid Floodplain Lakes Inundated with Environmental Flows	PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES												Shallow floodplain lakes are critical components of semi-arid floodplain wetland systems. Delivery of environmental flows that aim to sustain ecological processes of semi-arid floodplain wetlands has enhanced inundation of shallow lakes in inland Australia. To maximise environmental flow outcomes to support floodplain productivity and ecosystem functions, environmental managers would benefit from knowing whether semi-arid floodplain lakes function as a sink or source of atmospheric carbon. We investigated abiotic conditions, and rates of planktonic respiration and primary productivity of phytoplankton during summer under environmental flow conditions in three floodplain lakes of the lower Murrumbidgee River, Australia. All lakes showed mesoeutrophic to hypereutrophic characteristics and significant within- and between-lake variability in abiotic conditions, planktonic processes, and associated carbon balance. Nevertheless, the mean net primary productivity of phytoplankton in the lakes (364-1,674 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) were up to about three times greater than in other semi-arid floodplain wetlands of southeast Australia. Therefore, shallow floodplain lakes in semi-arid regions have great potential to function as a sink of atmospheric carbon through planktonic metabolism during summer. A spatial hierarchical framework for lake functional response to inundation is proposed to support decision-making and to maximise the benefits of environmental flow regimes for floodplain lakes.

Detection of lake extent, depth, and temporal evolution is important for understanding glacier dynamics. Previous remote sensing observations of lake depth are limited to estimates from passive satellite imagery, which has inherent uncertainties, and there is little ground truth available. In this study, we use laser altimetry data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) over the Antarctic and Greenland ablation zones and the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) for Hiawatha Glacier (Greenland) to demonstrate retrievals of supraglacial lake depth. Using an algorithm to separate lake surfaces and beds, we present case studies for 12 supraglacial lakes with the ATM lidar and 12 lakes with ICESat-2. Both lidars reliably detect bottom returns for lake beds as deep as 7 m. Lake bed uncertainties for these retrievals are 0.05-0.20m for ATM and 0.12-0.80m for ICESat-2, with the highest uncertainties observed for lakes deeper than 4 m. The bimodal nature of lake returns means that high-confidence photons are often insufficient to fully profile lakes, so lower confidence and buffer photons are required to view the lake bed. Despite challenges in automation, the altimeter results are promising, and we expect them to serve as a benchmark for future studies of surface meltwater depths.					; Flanner, Mark/C-6139-2011	Fricker, Helen Amanda/0000-0002-0921-1432; brunt, kelly/0000-0002-6462-6112; Fair, Zachary/0000-0002-6047-1723; Flanner, Mark/0000-0003-4012-174X													1994-0416	1994-0424				NOV 27	2020	14	11					4253	4263		10.5194/tc-14-4253-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4253-2020													WOS:000595564900001

Population dynamics of marine magnetotactic bacteria in a meromictic salt pond described with qPCR	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) contain membrane-bound magnetic iron minerals and are globally abundant in the suboxic/anoxic portions of chemically stratified marine and freshwater environments. However, their population dynamics and potential quantitative contribution to the biogeochemical cycles that they influence (iron, sulfur, carbon) have not been previously considered. Here we report the first quantitative description of the distribution of individual species of magnetite- and greigite-producing MTB in a natural system. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay targeting 16s rRNA genes to enumerate four major groups of marine MTB, and applied the assay to samples collected with respect to geochemical parameters during summer 2003 in seasonally stratified Salt Pond, MA. Using catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescent in situ hybridization, we also show that a large greigite-producing bacterium is distantly related to Thiomicrospira pelophila in the Gammaproteobacteria. Ribosomal RNA copy numbers obtained with quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicate that MTB comprise up to 10% of total Bacteria and that each organism has a characteristic distributional profile with respect to the chemocline.

Case of copper sulfate	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The appearance of cyanobacteria (> 10 colony per ml) was not prevented after alum treatment. In order to prevent cyanobacteria efflorescences in a small shallow polymictic lake (Courtille, France), copper sulfate was applied. Treatment level was 63 mug 1(-1) as Cu2+ from CuSO4, 5 H2O. Cyanobacteria were kept under control during the summer. Microcystis sp. completely disappeared, which allowed swimming in the lake throughout the tourist season. Microcystis only reappeared 2 months after the treatment. Copper content in the water column only returned to its background level 2 months after copper addition. This high residence time of copper in the water might have been caused by complexation and adsorption of copper on natural organic matter, whose level was high in the ecosystem studied. A mechanism of transfer of 'truly' dissolved copper towards particulate copper has been underlined and explains the disappearance of this fraction of copper in the water column.

CaCO3 content, delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb) of bulk carbonate, and the mineralogy of the parallel core GN-04 from Gun Nuur was performed to reconstruct the Holocene hydrology and climate on the northern Mongolian Plateau. The chronology was established using 40 C-14 dates of bulk organic matter in addition to nine previously published radiocarbon dates for core GN-02, and further five C-14 dates for the new core GN-04. A lake reservoir effect of 1060 C-14 years was determined as the intercept of the high-resolution GN-02 age-depth model at the modern sediment surface. The size of the reservoir effect is supported by the age of the core-top sample (1200 +/- 40 C-14 years) and the determined difference between a wood-derived radiocarbon age from the GN-02 core base and the age-model inferred age for bulk organic matter at the same stratigraphic level (1000 C-14 years). Low lake level and prevailing aeolian sediment deposition at Gun Nuur under dry conditions were recorded during the earliest Holocene (> 10,800-10,300 cal a BP). Gun Nuur expanded under significantly wetter conditions between 10,300 and 7000 cal a BP. Unstable climate conditions existed in the mid Holocene (7000-2500 cal a BP) and three periods of low lake-levels and significantly drier conditions were recorded between 7000-5700, 4100-3600 and 3000-2500 cal a BP. Intermediate lake levels were inferred for the intervening periods. Around 2500 cal a BP, the climate change and wetter conditions were established again. As a consequence, the lake level of Gun Nuur rose again due to higher effective moisture and the relatively wet present conditions were achieved ca. 1600 cal a BP. Our results suggest that the initial Holocene climate change on the northern Mongolian Plateau was not accompanied by a rapid increase in precipitation as on the Tibetan Plateau. The establishment of wetter conditions in northern Mongolia lagged behind the early Holocene moisture increase on the Tibetan Plateau by ca. 1000 years. Subsiding dry air in the north of the Tibetan Plateau resulted from the strengthened summer monsoon on the Tibetan Plateau during the period of maximum summer insolation and probably inhibited a significant precipitation increase in Mongolia. The significant moisture increase in the Gun Nuur region at ca. 10.3 cal ka BP is probably not related to the northward shift of the present summer monsoon boundary or the moisture delivery from the northern Atlantic through the westerlies. Instead, water from melting snow, ice and frozen ground and the generation of precipitation from the local recycling of moisture are discussed as possible moisture source for the early onset of wetter conditions on the Mongolian Plateau.

Dendroclimatological analysis demonstrates that precipitation has significant effects on tree growth in the semiarid mountainous area of northwestern Tajikistan located on the edge of the great midlatitude Karakum and Kyzylkum deserts. The highest level of linear correlation (r=0.67) is observed between tree growth and seasonalised winter (previous December-February) precipitation. Our studies also show that moisture (precipitation/Palmer Drought Severity Index) from the previous June to the current September was the dominant climatic factor accounting for interannual variations in tree-ring width, suggesting that this should be considered in climate reconstruction. Using the transfer function method, we reconstructed the region's drought history over the period AD 908-2015. The results of this moisture reconstruction showed that the most recent millennium was characterised by series of dry and wet stages. The driest periods occurred before 1000, 1200-1250, and at the end of the eighteenth century and beginning of the nineteenth century. The wettest conditions existed in 1650-1700 and after 1990.

This study investigated the effects of WLF on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity (GPP) of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang, a large floodplain-lake system in China. This study hypothesized that WLF is the key controlling regulator of the lake's nutrient status, phytoplankton growth and GPP, driven by its influence on the lake's hydrological connectivity in combination with water-flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters. The results showed that the intra-annual water levels in this lake varied from 7.61 m to 20.82 m while inter-annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989-2018 (P < 0.05). Except for pH, most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season. Mean GPP and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season, wet season and falling period. Moreover, nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and GPP during different periods, while water temperature (WT) also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and GPP during the water rising period. There was also a direct correlation between WLF and GPP during the water rising period, and WLF significantly affected nutrient concentration, subsequently impacting GPP. This study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain-lake systems, while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain-lake systems globally.					li, zhao xi/HPE-9629-2023; Jia, Junjie/AAQ-2527-2020; GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023; zhaoxi, li/HPE-9629-2023	li, zhao xi/0000-0003-1471-2917; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2021	599								126414	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126414		MAY 2021											WOS:000673486000060

Williamsella iraqiensis sp. nov., a new diatom (Bacillariophyta, Fragilariophyceae) from Sawa Lake, South Iraq	PHYTOTAXA												A new species of the genus Williamsella (Fragilariophyceae) is described from a saline lake in southern Iraq. Williamsella iraqiensis sp. nov. was found free living and as epiphyte on Chara sp. in Sawa Lake. This species is the second described of the genus Williamsella which was originally reported from Blue Lake warm springs, Utah, USA. Williamsella iraqiensis sp. nov. and W. angusta can be readily distinguished under LM by having a relatively wide sternum which results from shorter striae along valve margin. Description of valve ultrastructure and comparison with other related genera such as Fragilaria is provided. Williamsella iraqiensis is a brackish water species preferring warm waters.

Assessment of Recent Short-Term Water-Level Fluctuations in Caspian Sea Using Topex/Poseidon	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The Caspian Sea (CS) has long been the focus of an interest due to its large water-level fluctuations. The primary factors of the CS water-level variations have usually been deemed to changes in climatic parameters. The climate-induced changes particularly in precipitation over Volga River catchment and evaporation over CS mainly affect the CS level (CSL). We constructed extended and refined Topex/Poseidon time series to compute temporal mean water-level fluctuations from December 1992 to August 2005 over CS using the new gravity recovery and climate experiment orbits data, new sea state bias model, and Topex microwave radiometer drift correction. Four distinct phases in water-level variations are observed: a significant water-level rise between 1993 and mid-1995 followed by an abrupt decline from mid-1995 to summer 1997, then relatively modest decrease until mid-2002 and rise from summer 2002 onward. The analysis of-water budget parameters favors the recent understanding that Volga River discharge in conjunction with evaporation over CS are the two main components controlling water-level fluctuations of CS. Volga River discharge positively correlates with CS water-level rise and drop from 1993 to 1997 and in 1999, respectively. Evaporation should dominate over the Volga River runoff and primarily controls CSL fluctuations after 1997 through 2003. Additionally, we find that anthropogenic factors are insufficient to affect water-level oscillations except tor reservoir development or demolition. and water-level changes during 13-year time series are temporary variations.

Biomarkers reveal abrupt switches in hydroclimate during the last glacial in southern California	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Reconstructions of past hydroclimate provide a means to understand precipitation responses to global ocean-atmosphere climate dynamics beyond the scope of that in the instrumental record. Late glacial climate was characterized by abrupt variability in ice and ocean dynamics, however the implications for hydroclimate are not as well known. Here we present organic geochemical proxy evidence for precipitation isotopes based on plant leaf wax hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta D-wax) and temperature proxy evidence based upon the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), that derive from the membrane lipids of bacteria, each extracted from a sedimentary archive in Lake Elsinore, California spanning 32-9 ka. We add proxy evidence for vegetation and salinity from additional biomarker analyses and compare to prior pollen and sedimentological evidence from the same core. Our record indicates a strong deglacial warming of 10 degrees C in Lake Elsinore (beginning at 14.5 ka) that accompanied a D-enrichment of precipitation of +90 parts per thousand and more C-4 vegetation (12-10 ka), after a cold, wet and C-3-dominated phase (20-14.5 ka), indicating winter-dominated precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum and Heinrich Stadial 1. During the late glacial (32-20 ka) we find abrupt variability, with precipitation isotopic shifts (similar to 70 parts per thousand) that are independent of temperature swings implicating changes in storm track, rather than local temperature as drivers of the precipitation isotope signal. Temperature is however not irrelevant for hydroclimate: we find extreme warmth at 29.4 ka and 26.8 ka, the latter coincident with existing reports of an extended dry period (27.5 similar to 25.5 ka), suggesting a long hot and dry interlude during the generally cooler glacial period. We compare delta D-wax with speleothem delta O-18 from Nevada, also within the winter-dominated precipitation region. Our results corroborate the Last Glacial Maximum and deglacial signals, and fill gaps revealing storm-track instability from 32-20 ka, however the pacing and magnitude of the biomarker signals merit cautious interpretation.

The effect of a mixotrophic chrysophyte on toxic and colony-forming cyanobacteria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. In order to test the effect of Ochromonas sp., a mixotrophic chrysophyte, on cyanobacteria, grazing experiments were performed under controlled conditions. We studied grazing on three Microcystis aeruginosa strains, varying in toxicity and morphology, as well as on one filamentous cyanobacterium, Pseudanabaena sp. Furthermore, we analysed the co-occurrence of Ochromonas and Microcystis in natural systems in relation to various environmental parameters (TP, TN, DOC, temperature, pH), using data from 460 Norwegian lakes. 2. Ochromonas was able to feed on all four cyanobacterial strains tested, and grew quickly on all of them. The chrysophyte caused net growth reductions in all three Microcystis strains (the very toxic single-celled strain PCC 7806; the less toxic colony-forming Bear AC and the less toxic single-celled Spring CJ). The effect of Ochromonas was strongest on the Spring CJ strain. Although the effect of Ochromonas grazing on the growth of Pseudanabaena was relatively smaller, it also reduced the net growth of this cyanobacterium significantly. 3. After 4 days of incubation with Ochromonas the total amount of cyanotoxins in the three Microcystis strains was reduced by 91.1-98.7% compared with the controls. 4. Ochromonas occurred in similar densities across all 460 Norwegian lakes. Microcystis occurred only at higher TN, TP, temperature and pH values, although its density was often several orders of magnitude higher than that of Ochromonas. Ochromonas co-occurred in 94% of the samples in which Microcystis was present. 5. From our study it is not clear whether Ochromonas could control Microcystis blooms in natural lakes. However, our study does demonstrate that Ochromonas usually occurs in lakes with Microcystis, and our small scale experiments show that Ochromonas can strongly reduce the biomass of Microcystis and its toxin content.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Ptacnik, Robert/B-1347-2012; Verschoor, Anthony/D-8446-2011; Wilken, Susanne/C-4351-2013; Cerbin, Slawek/P-4735-2015	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Ptacnik, Robert/0000-0001-7176-7653; Wilken, Susanne/0000-0002-3852-557X; Cerbin, Slawek/0000-0002-2800-0390													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2009	54	9					1843	1855		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02227.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02227.x													WOS:000268791700004

This study aims to systematically review the developments, barriers, and future directions of thermal phenology in freshwaters under warming conditions through a visualized meta-analysis. According to the Web of Science Core Collection database, we retrieved 3262 articles published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2023, using an advanced search query that included terms related to global warming, temperature stratification, and freshwater bodies. The data was then analyzed via bibliometric visualization tools to create comprehensive visual maps, highlighting research hotspots and development trends. Key findings include a significant upward trend on this topic, in the annual number of published articles post-2015, in which China and the USA are leading in the publication output. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified climate change, global warming, and temperature as central themes, with specific environmental issues linking to lake eutrophication and runoff being prominent as well. The study also delves into the collaboration networks among researchers, institutions, and countries, revealing strong international partnerships primarily between China, the USA, and European nations. Based on the analysis, we recommend future research should focus on integrating machine learning and advanced modeling techniques to better predict and mitigate the impacts of climate warming on thermal dynamics of inland waters. By upscaling the research from traditionally local (or regional) to global perspective, our work is vital, not just for science, but also for management of the aquatic systems under rapidly changing climate conditions.

Here, we report two continuous cyclostratigraphic records derived from shallow to deep lake deposits in East Asia to unravel orbital-scale hydroclimatic fluc- tuations between 43.22 Ma and 37.48 Ma. Our results show that 40 k.y. obliquity cycles paced hydroclimate dominantly dur- ing 43.22-41.57 Ma and 40.20-37.48 Ma, with periods of wetter and warmer climate in obliquity maxima. Obliquity may have forced hydroclimatic fluctuations by modu- lating the intensity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon, possibly through intricate feed- back mechanisms involving high-latitude ice sheets within the climate system. Between 41.57 Ma and 40.20 Ma, 405 k.y. and similar to 100 k.y. eccentricity cycles became prominent. We observed transient warming events at the conjunctions of long and short eccen- tricity maxima. These findings suggest that the switch in the dominant orbital param- eter may have disturbed the global carbon cycle, which subsequently led to continental hydroclimatic change. Our study highlights the role of obliquity and eccentricity cycles in influencing climate dynamics and under- scores the importance of considering changes in dominant cycles when investigating conti- nental hydroclimatic change.

The input variables of Elman's RNN were selected by means of the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Chl_a concentration as output variable. Sequentially, the conceptual models for Elman's RNN were established and the Elman models were trained and validated on daily data set. The values of Chl_a concentration computed by the models were closely related to their respective values measured at the three sites. The correlation coefficient (R-2) between the predicted Chl_a concentration by the model and the observed value were 0.86-0.92. And sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the algal dynamic variation to the change of environmental factors. The results show that the CCA can efficiently ascertain appropriate input variables for Elman's RNN, the Elman's RNN can precisely forecast the Chl_a concentration at three different sites in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu in summer and sensitivity analysis validated the algal dynamic variation to the change of environmental factors which were selected by CCA.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-804-2				2013	779-780						1352	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.779-780.1352	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.779-780.1352													WOS:000336106300261

Flies were recaptured on ox fly-rounds carried out twice daily for 6 months; marks were recorded and the flies released. For females, 56% were recaptured at least once; the capture probability for a given 9-day period changed with age, falling from 0.32 after birth to 0.16 by 30 days and rising above 0.5 by 80 days. For males, 57% were recaptured; the probability was 0.21 for age less than 9 days, but > 0.77 for all older flies. The capture probabilities and fly-round catches were used to estimate the change with age in the daily mortality. Female mortality was 6.8% shortly after emergence, < 1% for ages 20-50 days and rose to 5% by 130 days-a pattern similar to that for laboratory reared tsetse. Male daily mortality was 8.3% after emergence, fell to 5.5% by 9 days, then rose continuously to more than 10% by 30 days. The mortality changes are related to age rather than climate. Tsetse caught on ox fly-rounds from a natural population were aged using ovarian dissection and wing-fray analysis. The age distribution (corrected using the capture probabilities from Redcliff) was consistent with the idea that, here too, mortality increased with age.																			0191-9040						1990	11	3					323	330		10.1017/S1742758400012741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742758400012741													WOS:A1990FG73800011

Characterization of organochloride pesticides residues in sediments from the Cienaga Grande of the lower Sinu river of Colombia	COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The levels of organochloride pesticides (OCPs) residues in sediment samples from four stations in the Cienaga Grande (swamp area) of the lower Sinu River in the Caribbean region and receiving run-offs from the Sinu River effluents in Cordoba, Colombia were investigated. Ninety-six composite samples of surface sediments covering a radius of 3 m were randomly collected using the "Van Veen" dredge technique and were subsequently analyzed for pesticide residues using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. A total of five OCPs residues, most of them persistent organic pollutants, were identified and quantified. Results showed that the concentrations of various pesticides in sediments were in the range of 2.85-7.05 ng/g for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), 0.26-2.31 ng/g for beta-HCH, 0.59-7.57 ng/g for gamma-HCH (lindane), 0.69-1.72 for aldrin, and 1.55-2.25 ng/g for heptachlor epoxide. Among the OCPs, the Sigma-HCH (total positional isomers of HCH) was the dominant compounds in the Cienaga Grande sediments. The study concluded that most of the stations monitored in the Cienaga Grande areas were contaminated with OCPs associated with the accumulation of water run-off from surrounding areas arriving at the location during the winter time. This in turn implies that the increased pollution load is related to the discharge of waste-water and solid waste from various municipal centers and towns located about the Cienaga Grande. run-off from surrounding areas arriving at the location during the winter time.

Dynamic hydrologic model of the Ortuluakar Marsh in Turkey	WETLANDS												A dynamic hydrologic model was developed for the Ortuluakar Marsh in Turkey to investigate the causes of water-level decreases observed since the 1990s and to explore potential remediation and sustainability options. Ortuluakar Marsh is a sub-system of the Sultan Marshes ecosystem, a large wetland complex consisting of freshwater marshes and salt-water lakes in the Develi Basin of south-central Turkey. The wetland has experienced significant seasonal and long-term waterlevel changes after the construction of an irrigation project in the catchment. The model uses a monthly time scale and solves the unsteady water-balance equation. Inputs from precipitation, overland flow, springs and ground water, and outputs due to evapotranspiration and surface flow are represented in the model. The model was calibrated to fit monthly water-level measurements from 1997 to 2003. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model is highly sensitive to evapotranspiration and ground-water inflow. Simulations of several water allocation options suggest that ground-water use should be reduced in the Develi Basin to halt the decline in water level in the Ortuluakar Marsh.

J	Leppäranta, M; Wen, LJ				Lepparanta, Matti; Wen, Lijuan			Ice Phenology in Eurasian Lakes over Spatial Location and Altitude	WATER												Eurasian freezing lakes cover an almost 180 degrees wide longitude sector between the latitudes 30 degrees and 75 degrees N, and their altitudes range from below the sea surface level up to 5 km elevation. Ice phenology varies widely in this region. However, these variations and their influence factors have been little studied. Analytic models are applied here to examine these variations supported by historical ice and weather data. These models are forced by a linear air-lake heat exchange formula based on local empirical fits. The weather brings latitude-longitude-altitude patterns to the large-scale lake ice phenology. Freezing and breakup dates are forced by the local air temperature and solar radiation, and their rates of change are also important. In addition, freezing depends on lake depth and breakup depends on accumulated ice thickness. Lake depth provides a lag and radiation balance provides a shift with respect to the air temperature in cooling of the lake, and breakup is dictated by spring warming conditions and ice thickness. Due to solar radiation forcing, the common degree-day approach is biased for modelling ice phenology, especially in low latitudes. Analytic models provide a first-order tool for climate sensitivity of ice seasons. The freezing date and breakup date both change by around five days per one-degree shift in air temperature away from the climatological ice margin; however, at this margin, the sensitivity is higher.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	7							1037	10.3390/w14071037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14071037													WOS:000781480700001

A total of 2699 field samples were collected, and 95 of the samples were positive by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of subtype H5 influenza virus. To some extent, the detection rate correlated with the species, the location, and the seasons of collection. In 2007, two H5N1 isolates were identified from two species of migratory birds. The two 2007 isolates showed high similarities of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes with those of the 2005 and 2006 Qinghai isolates (98.6-99.8% for HA and 98.7-98.9% for NA at the nucleotide level).

Source-bordering aeolian dune formation along the Scheldt River (southern Netherlands - northern Belgium) was caused by Younger Dryas cooling, high river gradient and southwesterly summer winds	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Younger Dryas cold period caused major changes in vegetation and depositional environments. This study focuses on the aeolian river-connected dunes along the former, Weichselian Late Glacial, course of the Scheldt River in the southern Netherlands. Aeolian dunes along the Scheldt have received little attention, as they are partly covered by Holocene peat and marine deposits. The spatial distribution of the dunes is reconstructed by digital elevation model analysis and coring transects. Dunes are present on the high eastern bank of the Scheldt and in the subsurface of the polder area west of the Brabantse Wal escarpment. A reach-specific higher channel gradient probably caused a channel pattern change from meandering to braiding during the Younger Dryas. This enabled deflation from the braid plain and accumulation in source-bordering river dunes east of the incised and terraced, subsurface Late Pleistocene Scheldt valley. The age of the dune formation is established by pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of underlying and overlying peat beds. The peat layer below the dune at Zomerbaan is attributed to the Allerod and early Younger Dryas periods. Dune formation occurred predominantly during the second part of the Younger Dryas stadial, both on and in front (west) of the Brabantse Wal escarpment. Wind direction was reconstructed by geomorphic analysis and sedimentary structures on lacquer peels. A southwesterly wind direction is demonstrated by the parabolic dune morphology. For the first time, Younger Dryas wind direction is reconstructed based on adhesion ripple cross-laminated sets on lacquer peels. Sand-transporting south-southwesterly winds were dominant during the Younger Dryas, most likely during summer.

The lake is generally dimictic. However, a partly meromictic status could be formed in specific meteorological conditions as occurred in springs of 2000 and 2001. The abundance of bacteria in Lake Verevi is highly variable (0.70 to 22 x 106 cells ml(-1)) and generally the highest in anoxic hypolinmetic water. In 2000-2001, the bacterial abundance in the hypolimnion increased probably due to meromixis. During a productive season, heterotrophic bacteria were able to consume about 10-40% of primary production in the epilimnion. Our study showed that bacterioplankton in the epilimnion was top-down controlled by predators, while in metalimnion bacteria were dependent on energy and carbon sources (bottom-up regulated). Below the thermocline hypolinmetic bacteria mineralized organic matter what led to the depletion of oxygen and created anoxic hypolimnion where rich mineral nutrient and sulphide concentrations coexisted with high bacterial numbers.

As a mid-continental active fault, it is one of the most important seismogenic fractures in the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Geological seismic study is an important supplement to the historical seismic record; therefore, identification of paleoearthquake events in this region is of great significance to reveal the pattern and mechanism of earthquake development. In this study, detailed investigation has been carried out on the earthquake traces that formed in the Quaternary sediments in the Jinsha River section of the Chenghai fault zone, and samples for dating chronology testing were also collected. Many paleoearthquake traces were discovered in the field, including earthquake fissions, dammed lake sediments and landslides, earthquake-generated rock falls, seismic faults, and sand liquefaction veins. The collected samples were tested using optically stimulated luminescence, electron-spin resonance, and U-series methods. A total of 68 chronological samples were dated, combined with the results of field investigations, and 10 large paleoearthquake events were discovered in this region since 500 ka, which are at approximately 450, 400, 345, 300, 250, 190, 155, 105, 75, and 25 ka. Ten tectonic activity periods that produced multiple paleoearthquake events were identified since 500 ka. This study identifies paleoearthquake events in longer scales, larger spaces, and more extensive sediments, which provides new perspectives and new ideas for paleoearthquake research.

J	Popp, A; Hoagland, KD; Hergenrader, GL				Popp, A; Hoagland, KD; Hergenrader, GL			Zooplankton community response to reservoir aging	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes in zooplankton diversity and density in response to reservoir aging in Pawnee Reservoir were investigated. Zooplankton samples collected from April 1992 through April 1993, were compared to a similar study conducted after initial impoundment by Helzer (1971), in 1968-1970. Since this initial study, increases in turbidity and resulting changes in biotic interactions significantly altered the zooplankton community. A significant increase in total zooplankton density and a decrease in species richness were observed between study periods. Density increased from 24.6 to 95.4 individuals L(-1), while the number of taxa declined from fourteen to ten. During this time period, Cyclops vernalis became the dominant zooplankter in the reservoir. The density of this predatory copepod increased significantly, from less than or equal to 0.1 l(-1) in 1968-1970, to 44.3 l(-1) in 1992-1993, which accounted for most of the increase in total zooplankton density. Though a greater spring maximum of another dominant, Bosmina spp. was found during the 1992-1993 study period, the annual density of this cladoceran was not significantly different between study periods. Similar trends for Daphnia ambigua and D. parvula were also observed, as greater spring maxima levels were attained, however overall annual densities were not significantly different. The dominance of C. vernalis (46% of annual density) and Bosmina spp. (33%), indicate that these two zooplankters were tolerant of changes in physical conditions resulting from reservoir aging and biotic interactions that followed in the reservoir during the 22 years between study periods.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	1996	339	1-3					13	21		10.1007/BF00008908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008908													WOS:A1996WC90400003

Fish and Wildlife Service began research on the life history, population dynamics, and stock delineation of siscowet lake trout Salvelinus namaycush siscowet in Lake Superior. Siscowet were captured with gill nets in 80-150 m of water on 23-26 April 1992 north of the Apostle Islands in western Lake Superior. Of 91 captured siscowets, one male had fully developed testes in nearly ripe condition and one female had eggs running from the vent.

J	Sun, W; Zhao, SJ; Pei, HY; Yang, H				Sun, Wei; Zhao, Shijin; Pei, Hongye; Yang, Huan			The coupled evolution of mid- to late Holocene temperature and moisture in the southeast Qaidam Basin	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The southeast Qaidam Basin (SQB) lies near the boundary between the modern-day Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and mid-latitude westerly jet, and the paleoclimate variation in this region can be affected by these two atmospheric circulation systems. Reconstructions of paleotemperature and palaeohydrology are therefore critical to constraining the driving forces of climate in this region, where the ecological environment is fragile. Here, we analyzed glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), microbial membrane lipids occurring ubiquitously in aquatic and terrestrial environments across the globe, in an aeolian sediment profile over the last 7000 years from Xiangride Town (XRD) of southeast Qaidam Basin (SQB), China. The temperature record was generated using the global calibration of MAT(mr) based on branched GDGTs (brGDGTs), whereas the palaeohydrological condition was reconstructed from the relative abundance of isoprenoid GDGTs vs. brGDGTs (R-i/b), the cyclisation index of brGDGTs (CBT), and the brGDGT-based pH indices. The results show that the paleoclimate during the mid-Holocene was relatively warmer and wetter in the SQB. Afterwards it was a trend to a cold and dry climate. Temperature variation was highly coupled with the moisture change during the mid- to late Holocene, as opposed to some previous studies showing a warm-dry and cold-wet climate pattern in the northern Qaidam basin. The palaeohydrological evolution agrees with the precipitation pattern of the Chinese loess plateau but opposes to that in Northeastern China, the middle reaches of Yangtze river and Arid Central Asia (ACA), implying that the ASM strength is the driving force of precipitation evolution during the mid- to late Holocene in the SQB and the spatial heterogeneity of the mid- to late Holocene precipitation pattern across China is remarkable. A rapid cold and drought event at around 4 ka before present (BP) was identified, which might be a key factor that caused the decline in the agricultural civilization during the late Neolithic Age in northwestern China.

The model inputs annual depths of precipitation, applies deterministic relationships, and outputs six-month volumes of net inflow to Lake Kinneret, Israel. At any given time within the rainy season, the depth of precipitation is considered as being composed of two components: (1) the depth accumulated since commencement of the meteorological year; and (2) the depth that would probably fall from that time until the end of the year. Based upon past records, probability distributions were prepared for annual depths as well as for depths during subseasons commencing at selected times. The expected value of flow volumes forecasted early in the rainy season might deviate widely from the volumes actually observed, whereas values forecasted at midseason and later attain reliable accuracies. It is therefore advisable to issue a wide range of probable flow volumes and progressively update the forecast during the rainy season.																			1084-0699					OCT	1999	4	4					381	385		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(1999)4:4(381)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(1999)4:4(381)													WOS:000207775500012

Water Circulation Driven by Cold Fronts in the Wax Lake Delta (Louisiana, USA)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Atmospheric cold fronts can periodically generate storm surges and affect sediment transport in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM). In this paper, we evaluate water circulation spatiotemporal patterns induced by six atmospheric cold front events in the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana using the 3-D hydrodynamic model ECOM-si. Model simulations show that channelized and inter-distributary water flow is significantly impacted by cold fronts. Water volume transport throughout the deltaic channel network is not just constrained to the main channels but also occurs laterally across channels accounting for about a quarter of the total flow. Results show that a significant landward flow occurs across the delta prior to the frontal passage, resulting in a positive storm surge on the coast. The along-channel current velocity dominates while cross-channel water transport occurs at the southwest lobe during the post-frontal stage. Depending on local weather conditions, the cold-front-induced flushing event lasts for 1.7 to 7 days and can flush 32-76% of the total water mass out of the system, a greater range of variability than previous reports. The magnitude of water flushed out of the system is not necessarily dependent on the duration of the frontal events. An energy partitioning analysis shows that the relative importance of subtidal energy (10-45% of the total) and tidal energy (20-70%) varies substantially from station to station and is linked to the weather impact. It is important to note that within the WLD region, the weather-induced subtidal energy (46-66% of the total) is much greater than the diurnal tidal energy (13-25% of the total). The wind associated with cold fronts in winter is the main factor controlling water circulation in the WLD and is a major driver in the spatial configuration of the channel network and delta progradation rates.

Evident progress in global warming leads to a decrease in snow cover on land and ice phenomena in water bodies, disrupting the stability of the hydrological cycle and aquatic ecosystems. Although common observations indicate the disappearance of ice phenomena in rivers over recent decades, detailed quantitative research is lacking in many regions, especially in the temperate zone. In this paper, ice phenomena were analyzed on the rivers of southern Poland, located in the upland and mountain areas of the country, as no such studies have been conducted so far. The temporal changes in the annual number of days with ice (NDI) phenomena were studied in locations where ice phenomena were observed every year for at least 30 years between 1951 and 2021. Using straightforward but commonly accepted procedures, such as the Mann-Kendall test, statistically significant decreasing trends in the annual NDI were revealed for the majority of gauging stations. The Theil-Sen (TS) slope mean values were -1.66 (ranging from -3.72 to -0.56), -1.41 (from -3.22 to -0.29), and -1.33 (from -2.85 to -0.29) for the datasets representing the periods 1992-2020, 1987-2020, and 1982-2020, respectively. The results for the annual NDI were additionally presented within the context of meteorological characteristics such as annual and winter (Nov-Apr) air temperature, precipitation, and water temperature. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that the main factor triggering the decrease in NDI is the increase in the average winter air temperature. An increase in temperature by 1 degrees C results in a decrease in NDI by up to twenty days. If these negative trends continue, ice phenomena may disappear completely from southern Polish rivers within few decades.

In this study, we isolated and identified three H5N8 viruses from swan goose and black swans in Hubei province during the 2016/2017 winter season. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three viruses clustered into a group of H5N8 viruses from Qinghai Lake and Europe. A novel reassortment virus from swan goose was distinguished from that of black swans, in that its PA and NP genes were distinct from those of Qinghai Lake viruses. Molecular dating revealed that the ancestral strain of these H5N8 viruses emerged around July 2015. From sequence comparison, we discovered eight amino acid substitutions in HA and NA during the adaption process from poultry to wild birds. The three viruses were isolated from wild birds in the East Asian-Australasian flyway; however, the viral genomes were similar to H5N8 viruses circulating along the Central Asian flyway. From these data, we conclude that wetlands and lakes in Central China may play a key role in disseminating H5N8 viruses between the East Asian-Australasian and Central Asian flyways.

The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of fish community structure (species composition, incidence and relative abundance) in relation to salinity, pH and temperature gradients in an Arctic estuary, the Husky Lakes, Canada. Sampling involved an early-summer, standardized, experimental netting survey around the entire perimeter of all estuary basins and peninsulas. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) was used to evaluate species-environment associations. The ecosystem sustains an abundant and diverse fish community, characterized by co-dominance of coregonids and a marine schooling fish, Clupea pallasii, and high abundance of freshwater/freshwater-amphidromous species in the innermost basins. Highest richness and total abundance were related to mixing conditions, warmest temperatures, connectivity to nearby ecosystems, and diversity in species life histories. Salinity determined spatial patterns of fish species abundance and distribution. The incidence of freshwater fish was limited by the availability of low salinity habitat and potential community interactions. These fish, particularly Salvelinus namaycush and Thymallus arcticus, are considered as the most vulnerable to changes in freshwater habitat availability. The fish assemblage reflects environmental information from surrounding fluvial, freshwater, coastal marine and catchment ecosystems, and is thus a prime candidate for monitoring environmental change in the region. The results provide a benchmark against which future studies of fish communities can be compared to evaluate potential effects of climate change and anthropogenic development on fish populations from Husky Lakes and similar Arctic aquatic ecosystems.

The climate change in the Holocene in this area provides a scientific basis for controlling the sandstorm sources affecting Beijing and Tianjin. Currently, there is no consensus on the changes in humidity that occurred during the early Holocene. Based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and AMS 14C dating of two aeolian sections, combined with magnetic susceptibility, grain size, colour parameters and geochemical element climatic proxies, we reconstructed Holocene climatic changes in the Hunshandake Sandy Land. Optimum climatic conditions occurred during 8.4-4.2 ka, when the monsoon precipitation was the strongest. After -4.2 ka, the climate was dominantly semi-humid to arid. By reviewing the aeolian and lake records from the other Hunshandake Sandy Land records, we suggest that the early Holocene was characterized by shallow lakes or rivers in low-lying areas, suggesting increased snowmelt driven by high solar radiation and increased surface runoff where surface vegetation is sparse. We observed a sudden shift in the layers from river/lake sands to palaeosols, along with abrupt changes in multiple indicators, corresponding to sedimentation linked to the 8.2 ka and 4.2 ka events. By comparing the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation, Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, and ice volume area, we suggest that the evolution of the Holocene East Asian monsoon was influenced by a combination of changes in the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet and solar radiation, which drove climate change in the Hunshandake Sandy Land.

Spatial variation in bioclimatic relationships for a snow-adapted species along a discontinuous southern range boundary	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Variation in the relationship between variables across space, known as spatial non-stationarity, is a common phenomenon in ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs), however, typically assume stationarity in species-environment relationships across space. Spatial non-stationarity may be particularly apparent in populations along range boundaries where species are actively adapting to changes in climate, and geographically isolated areas where isolation can facilitate adaptation. We used data collected from the southern range boundary of a winter-adapted mammal to evaluate spatially varying environmental relationships in a region with a geographically isolated population. Taxon Lepus americanus. Location Laurentian Great Lakes region, USA. Methods We surveyed 320 sites for snowshoe hares near their regional southern range boundary. We related snowshoe hare occurrence to short-term climate variables (snow cover duration, maximum temperature and their interaction) with a spatially explicit model that allowed the effect of climate variables on snowshoe hare occurrence to vary spatially. Results We found highest support for an SDM that incorporated geographic barriers when estimating spatial effects, in addition to spatially varying effects of maximum temperate, snow cover duration and their interaction. Hares were more likely to occupy sites with longer snow cover duration but the influence of temperature was more variable. Increasing temperature in northern portions of our study area had a positive influence on hare occurrence, but exhibited a negative relationship along the southern range boundary. Main Conclusions We provide a robust evaluation of stationarity assumptions in bioclimatic relationships and highlight spatially variable relationships between a cold-adapted species and short-term climate variables across a range boundary. However, spatial non-stationarity was not most apparent across dispersal barriers but coincided with differences in the relationship between climate variables across space. Our study provides evidence that the distribution of a winter-adapted species is strongly constrained by snow cover, but prevailing temperature modulates the strength of this relationship across space.

Lawrence			Role of climate in the rise and fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Northern Iraq was the political and economic center of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 912 to 609 BCE)-the largest and most powerful empire of its time. After more than two centuries of regional dominance, the Neo-Assyrian state plummeted from its zenith (c. 670 BCE) to complete political collapse (c. 615 to 609 BCE). Earlier explanations for the Assyrian collapse focused on the roles of internal politico-economic conflicts, territorial overextension, and military defeat. Here, we present a high-resolution and precisely dated speleothem record of climate change from the Kuna Ba cave in northern Iraq, which suggests that the empire's rise occurred during a two-centuries-long interval of anomalously wet climate in the context of the past 4000 years, while megadroughts during the early-mid seventh century BCE, as severe as recent droughts in the region but lasting for decades, triggered a decline in Assyria's agrarian productivity and thus contributed to its eventual political and economic collapse.

This is due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation since slight changes in water and ice flows, location of the ice jam toe along the river and initial water levels at the time of jam formation can lead to marked differences in the outcome of backwater level elevations and flood severity. In this paper, we introduce a novel, operational real-time flood forecasting system that captures this stochastic nature of ice-jam floods and places the forecasts in a probabilistic context in the form of flood hazard maps (probability of flood extents and depths). This novel system was tested successfully for the ice-cover breakup period in the spring of 2018 along the Athabasca River at the Town of Fort McMurray, Canada.

For this purpose experiments were performed using mesocosms in the eutrophic shallow Lake Suwa (4 m average depth) during summer when the parasitic fungi were active. The lake is characterized by frequent vertical mixing due to wind and convection currents. Based upon previous kinetic studies, a working hypothesis was tested, that the diatom population biomass can decrease as a result of increased loss rates by fungal infection, relative to the growth rate of the alga in summer. It was possible to acclerate the growth rate, and thereby exceed the parasitic loss rate, by decreasing the mixing depth to 1 m (where the euphotic zone is about 2 m) using mesocosms. The diatom population captured in the mesocosms increased, whereas that in the lake consistently decreased to a yearly minimum density. These results correspond well with estimates predicted by models from previous studies, in which changes in diatom population biomass were determined mainly by the balance between specific growth rate and parasitic loss rate. Further, the importance of fungal control of the diatom population has been confirmed experimentally, as was suggested from previous modelling approaches. The existence of a threshold population density for parasitic fungal attack of the host diatom is also discussed.																			0003-9136					MAY	1992	124	3					293	307																WOS:A1992HV44500003

The population reached 550 billion animals (4000/m(2), mean over the freshwater tidal river) by the end of 1992, constituting >70% of zoobenthic biomass, and filtered a volume equivalent to the entire water column in 1 day. Over 95% of the population lived on subtidal rocks. Following the period of rapid population growth in 1991-1992, reproductive success (young of the year per adult) fell by four orders of magnitude in 1993-1994. Furthermore, at the end of the 1993-1994 growing seasons, young of the year were only 20-30% as large as in 1991. Adult zebra mussels may have been outcompeting the larvae for food. We propose that such food-limited zebra mussel populations may be especially frequent in rivers and estuaries, where the ratio of food supply to available substratum is small.

In this study, high-resolution centennial to millennial-scale regional vegetation changes and associated climatic variability (Indian Summer Monsoon) is being reconstructed from a sedimentary profile of Shakti Wetland, Ladakh Northwestern Himalaya deposited during the Late Holocene. The reconstructed climate and vegetation record is based on a multi-proxy approach which are pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), stable isotopes (delta C-13(org), delta N-15(bulk)), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) derived from sedimentary profile spanning the last similar to 3200 cal yr BP. A substantial variability in the ISM strengths was found throughout the profile covering the time span of similar to 3230-740 cal yr BP. The peak warm and wet condition occurred during similar to 2890 to 2630 cal yr BP, inferred from the rise in an alpine meadow, dry steppe, and marshy taxa. This interval is characterized by relatively lower delta N-15 suggesting increased nitrification. The first evidence of Cerealia pollen indicated that human settlement near the study area might have initiated around similar to 2700 cal yr BP. Pollen data show a mixed forest type vegetation from similar to 2630-2130 cal yr BP. The increase in alpine taxa suggests a wet phase from similar to 1280 to 740 cal yr BP which globally corresponds to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). In addition, spectral analysis on the delta C-13 proxy shows multiple periodicities during the last similar to 3200 cal yr BP reinforcing the idea of solar control on climate variability of Ladakh.

J	Londeix, L; Herreyre, Y; Turon, JL; Fletcher, W				Londeix, Laurent; Herreyre, Yannick; Turon, Jean-Louis; Fletcher, William			Last Glacial to Holocene hydrology of the Marmara Sea inferred from a dinoflagellate cyst record	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The history of the connection between the Mediterranean and Black seas since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is documented through the study of an organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) record at high temporal resolution from the Marmara Sea (MD01-2430 core). Late Glacial dinocyst assemblages indicate that the Marmara Sea was a mildly brackish (caspibrackish) lake with mean annual sea-surface salinities (SSS) around 7-14 psu which probably experienced low seasonal contrasts in SSS; winter and summer sea-surface temperature (SST) were probably around 3-5 and 10-13 degrees C, respectively. This climatic and hydrological context remained effectively unchanged up to 20.5 cal. ka BP. Prior to the end of the LGM, a clear warming preceding a strong meltwater influx has been observed for the first time in the Marmara Sea as early as similar to 20.5 cal. ka BP. The meltwater episode presents a two-step history: 1) a weak phase (similar to 20.0 to 18.1 cal. ka BP) which corresponds to a possible melting of hinterland permafrost; and 2) a strong phase with important meltwater inflow originating from melting of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet and arriving via the Black Sea. Occuring from similar to 18.1 to 15.9 cal. ka BP, the second phase implies that Black Sea sea-level temporarily exceeded the Bosphorus sill at that time (ca Heinrich Event 1). The introduction of meltwater into the Marmara Sea caused very high seasonal contrasts in Marmara Sea surface-water salinity and temperature. During the Bolling/Allerod, the Marmara Sea was again a caspibrackish lake experiencing relatively cold conditions (with low seasonal contrast in SST) and enhanced moisture as recorded on the continent. Inflowing Mediterranean waters filled the Marmara Sea bottom-waters ca 12.2 cal. ka BP (approximatively the beginning of the Younger Dryas), then reached the sea-surface at similar to 11.7 cal. ka BP. Younger Dryas SSTs were colder than during the Bolling/Allerod, with a likely enhancement of seasonal SST contrasts. At the beginning of the Holocene, SSTs may have been slightly cooler than today, with minimum SSS ranging from 13 to 17.5 psu (maximum 27 psu) and likely with high seasonality in both SST and SSS (possibly up to 19 degrees C and 17 psu). During the deposition of the Holocene sapropel M1, the Marmara Sea experienced enhanced primary productivity and dysoxic/anoxic conditions in the benthic zone. Dinocyst assemblages from the M1 time interval do not provide evidence of an enhanced outflow from the Black Sea. Following the connection of the Mediterranean to the Black Sea (similar to 9 cal. ka BP), several distinct climatic and hydrological phases occurred, including a short cooling (similar to 7.5 to 5.8 cal. ka BP; possibly linked to a strengthening of the Siberian High [Kotthoff, U., Pross,J., Muller, U.C., Peyron, C., Schmiedl, G., Schulz, H., Bordon, A., 2008.

The timing of this sequence appears close to that recorded in the Black Sea, supporting the idea that the two basins would have operated in tandem. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gradual fertilization of a whole lake stimulated productivity, via chrysophytes and cladoceran zooplankton, through the entire pelagic food chain without causing structural damage to the system. Although P is considered the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in acidified and limed lakes, in two out of four lakes we found a close balance between P and N limitation. In acidified Lake Njupfatet, phytoplankton community structure changed depending on the form in which nitrogen, added together with phosphorus, was supplied. A cyanophyte was favored with ammonium, whereas a dinoflagellate dominated when nitrate was the nitrogen source. Chrysophytes, the desired ''edible'' phytoplankton, were only stimulated when organic carbon was added together with N and P. Many flagellates are mixotrophic and they may have responded to an increase in heterotrophic bacterial growth. Nutrient additions during late summer, when cyanophytes dominated, did not improve the growth of any component of the plankton community. Liming of Lake Njupfatet resulted in decreases both in phosphorus concentration and in standing stock of phytoplankton. The phytoplankton community after liming changed markedly, the cyanophytes disappeared, while the zooplankton community composition remained typical of acidified lakes. Nutrient additions during late summer resulted in increased growth of both phyto- and zooplankton. We argue that controlled nutrient additions may be a necessary complement to liming in order to restore acidified lakes.																			0044-7447					AUG	1993	22	5					283	289																WOS:A1993LX87900006

Controls on in-stream nitrogen loss in western Lake Erie tributaries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Management efforts to reduce cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) in the Great Lakes have focused on decreasing tributary inputs of phosphorus (P). Recent research has indicated that reduction of both P and nitrogen (N) can lessen cHABs severity. Microbially mediated N cycling in streambed sediment may reduce N riverine loads, yet little is known about in -stream N processing rates in the Maumee River Basin, a major source of nutrients to Lake Erie. During summer of 2019 and 2021, we sampled streambed sediment to measure potential nitrification and denitrification rates using the acetylene block method at 78 sites throughout the Maumee River network. We used structural equation models to identify indirect and direct drivers of denitrification. Precipitation was greater in 2019, resulting in a 67 % increase in mean discharge, 41 % of farm fields to be fallow, and a 50 % reduction in fertilizer use. During summer field surveys, median stream -water nitrate concentrations were not different between 2019 and 2021. Median denitrification rates were 13.3 mg N/m 2 /h and 31.2 mg N/m 2 /h, respectively, indicating high potential to remove N. Nitrate concentrations and nitrification rates were strong direct drivers of denitrification, especially in 2019 when coupled nitrification -denitrification sustained denitrification. Nitrate concentrations varied with land use. Notably, nitrate concentrations increased with the area of fallow land, which may indicate the presence of a legacy N source. These findings indicate that promoting streambed denitrification could reduce N loads to Lake Erie, but legacy N currently stored in the system may mask N reduction efforts.					; Hood, James/AFL-8629-2022	Bartsch, Lynn/0000-0002-1483-4845; Manning, Nathan/0000-0003-0394-9652; Kreiling, Rebecca/0000-0002-9295-4156; Johnson, Laura/0000-0002-2432-2624; Gierke, Kenna/0000-0002-8358-7825; Perner, Patrik/0000-0002-6142-518X													0380-1330					APR	2024	50	2							102284	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102284		MAR 2024											WOS:001222954200001

According to results obtained, it was observed that heavy metals were accummulated in liver in the highest degree and lowest one in the muscle tissues. MDA and GSH levels varied in the seasons but their winter levels were found to be statistically meaningful when compared with other seasons. The obtained data of metals from the study were compared with the acceptable levels of Turkish governmental regulation and they were found not to be harmful for human health.

Springing dives were more frequently in deeper water and when wave action was higher, but there were no clear differences between males and females. As well, the dive-pause regressions for males and females did not differ.

J	Chalkia, E; Kehayias, G				Chalkia, E.; Kehayias, G.			Zooplankton community dynamics and environmental factors in Lake Ozeros (Greece)	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												A one-year investigation of the zooplankton community composition and dynamics in Lake Ozeros (western Greece) revealed 25 invertebrate species (16 rotifers, three copepods, five cladocerans and one mollusc larva). The mean zooplankton abundance fluctuated between 59.4 to 818 ind 1(-1), with maximum values in spring. The species composition and seasonal variation do not differentiate Lake Ozeros from the nearby lakes. The presence of the dominant calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus drieschi and some of the rotifer species recorded are characteristic of either oligo- or eutrophic lakes. According to the trophic state index (TSI), Lake Ozeros is a meso-eutrophic ecosystem, in which the eutrophic character is possibly the result of the high phosphorus load (being 28.9% higher in comparison to previous decades), which is due to the surrounding agricultural cultivations and mainly the pig-raising activities. In contrast, the concentrations of NO3, NO2 and NH4 have considerably decreased possibly due to the termination of tobacco cultivations around the lake during the last years. The novel information on the abiotic and especially the biotic elements of Lake Ozeros provided by this study can contribute to the effective management of this aquatic ecosystem in the future.																			1108-393X						2013	14	3			SI		32	41		10.12681/mms.534	http://dx.doi.org/10.12681/mms.534													WOS:000329338800004

The ratio of annual mean to maximum biomass averages 0.45 for tropical lakes and is significantly lower for temperature lakes (0.36). Seasonal (3-month peak) ratios of mean to maximum biomass (approximately 0.7) do not differ for oligotrophic tropical and temperature lakes, but the ratios for temperate lakes fall below those of tropical lakes at higher trophic states. Tropical lakes of given trophic state have a higher minimum biomass than temperate lakes of the same trophic state; both temperate and tropical lakes show a strong increase in minimum biomass with increasing maximum biomass. The relative range of annual variation for temperate lakes is approximately 40% greater than for tropical lakes. Differences in the stability of layering and in the duration of seasonal mixing probably explain much of the difference in variability of biomass for tropical and temperate lakes that stratify.																			0024-3590					DEC	1990	35	8					1838	1845		10.4319/lo.1990.35.8.1838	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.8.1838													WOS:A1990FE65500016
J	Wang, H				Wang, Hui			Regional assessment of human-caused ecological risk in the Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone using production-living-ecology analysis	PLOS ONE												In this study, based on the regional land-use risk space division (regional ecological risk source/receptor space identification) using production-living-ecology analysis, three spatial function indexes, i.e., production, living, and ecology function indexes, were proposed for regional ecological risk assessment (RERA) with respect to human disturbance. The first two indexes can be regarded as regional ecological risk source indexes, whereas the final index can be regarded as a regional ecological risk receptor index. Using an artificial assignment method based on the land-use types and Defense Meteorological Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light intensity data, these three spatial function indexes were effectively manifested. By incorporating these indexes with eco-environmental vulnerability proxies, an RERA framework was established and applied in the Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone (PLEZ), which is an ecological-protection and economic-development coordination-oriented region in China. The results suggest that (1) the DMSP/OLS nighttime light intensity data correlated well with the spatial distribution of regional urban/town areas; consequently, it was reasonable to use this dataset for representing regional production-living function space (urban/town area). (2) Overall, the forestlands and winter waterbodies of Poyang Lake were in the high-risk grade, and so did the Nanchang City construction land area; in contrast, the final risk levels of winter wetlands and croplands were relatively low. (3) Owing to the highest human disturbance (including both production and consumption human activities) and eco-environmental vulnerability level, urban/town areas such as Nanchang City had the highest final risk grade. (4) The low, medium, high, and very high-risk grades accounted for 21.22%, 39.53%, 36.31%, and 2.94% of the region, respectively. I believe that the proposed land use function indexes will be helpful in conducting human-caused RERA research in the future. Furthermore, the assessment results can provide a scientific basis for regional ecological risk management within the PLEZ.

C.; Treydte, Kerstin			Site-specific climatic signals in stable isotope records from Swedish pine forests	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Pinus sylvestris tree-ring delta C-13 and delta O-18 records from locally moist sites in central and northern Sweden contain consistently stronger climate signals than their dry site counterparts. We produced twentieth century stable isotope data from Pinus sylvestris trees near lakeshores and inland sites in northern Sweden (near Kiruna) and central Sweden (near Stockholm) to evaluate the influence of changing microsite conditions on the climate sensitivity of tree-ring delta C-13 and delta O-18. The data reveal a latitudinal trend towards lower C and O isotope values near the Arctic tree line (-0.8 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and - 2.4 parts per thousand for delta O-18 relative to central Sweden) reflecting widely recognized atmospheric changes. At the microsite scale, delta C-13 decreases from the dry inland to the moist lakeshore sites (- 0.7 parts per thousand in Kiruna and - 1.2 parts per thousand in Stockholm), evidence of the importance of groundwater access to this proxy. While all isotope records from northern and central Sweden correlate significantly against temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and/or drought data, climate signals in the records from moist microsites are consistently stronger, which emphasizes the importance of site selection when producing stable isotope chronologies. Overall strongest correlations are found with summer temperature, except for delta O-18 from Stockholm correlating best with instrumental drought indices. These findings are complemented by significant positive correlations with temperature-sensitive ring width data in Kiruna, and inverse (or absent) correlations with precipitation-sensitive ring width data in Stockholm. A conclusive differentiation between leading and co-varying forcings is challenging based on only the calibration against often defective instrumental climate data, and would require an improved understanding of the physiological processes that control isotope fractionation at varying microsites and joined application of forward modelling.

Alum efficacy 11 years following treatment: phosphorus and macroinvertebrates. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:167181.Internal phosphorus loading and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure were analyzed at 4 sites in Spring Lake, Michigan, 11 yr following an alum treatment. Phosphorus (P) release rates, benthic macroinvertebrate community structure, sediment chemistry, and water quality variables (total dissolved solids, pH, dissolved oxygen, water clarity) were compared to measurements taken previously (2003/2004: pre-alum application, 2006: 8 mo post-alum application, and 2010: 5 yr post-alum application) at the same sites and using comparable methods. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in surface water samples from 2016 (3845 g/L) were similar to those measured in 2006 and 2010 (2080 g/L) at all sites; however, 2016 TP concentrations in the near-bottom water at the 2 deeper sites were elevated (250 and 1,000 g/L, respectively) compared to TP concentrations of < 60 g/L in 2006 and 2010, suggesting internal loading may be increasing, at least at these 2 sites. In contrast, maximum P release rates from the 2016 sediments were similar to or lower than 2010 rates, and an order of magnitude lower than before alum was applied. Phosphorus content in the sediment was fractionated; loosely sorbed sediment SRP concentrations were very low at all sites. Macroinvertebrate community was similar in density and composition to the 2010 results. These results are suggestive, but not conclusive, that internal P loading is increasing in parts of Spring Lake. Alum application can serve as an effective short-term solution to the longer-term problem of internal P loading, but its effectiveness is critically tied to concurrent reductions in external P loading.

Moored measurements of temperature and level in the northern part of the lake reveal the presence of seiches oscillations of the first and second modes, with periods of 5.7 and 2.8 hours, and amplitudes of 15.4 and 2.1 mm. In 2006 four temperature cross-sections were carried out in the study area. The obtained data reveal that in all four seasons of the year the temperatures averaged over the north and south coastal areas differ by 2-3 degrees C. The lake currents were simulated using the HAMSOM 2-D hydrodynamic model both for wet and dry seasons. The model results are in good agreement with the ADCP data. The presence of an anticyclonic gyre, 10-12 km in diameter, in the central part of the lake in both seasons is revealed. In particular, the summer 2014 data provide evidence of the gyre and its impact on the spatial distribution of temperature in the lake.

Here we identify representative low-elevation examples of scree slopes and frost action, together with fans and valley fills, indicating pronounced erosion cycles during the Pleistocene. To date the deposits, we explore approaches using radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, and profile dating using the cosmogenic nuclide Be-10. The radiocarbon and optical ages show that screes, alluvial valley fill, and fans were deposited between 66-13 ka during the coldest part of the last glacial cycle, and within the previous glacial cycle. Exposure dating indicates further landscape erosion cycles back to the mid Pleistocene. Together, the deposits indicate the frost cracking limit was similar to 1300 m lower at 680 +/- 10 m and mean winter temperature was 8.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C colder than present. Periglacial conditions probably affected much of southeastern Australia. The treeless and dry conditions resulted in widespread erosion and increased run off. Combined with increased snow storage within catchments, rivers were paradoxically larger, with high seasonal discharge and sediment loads.

J	Farajzadeh, J; Alizadeh, F				Farajzadeh, Jamileh; Alizadeh, Farhad			A hybrid linear-nonlinear approach to predict the monthly rainfall over the Urmia Lake watershed using wavelet-SARIMAX-LSSVM conjugated model	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												The present study aimed to develop a hybrid model to predict the rainfall time series of Urmia Lake watershed. For this purpose, a model based on discrete wavelet transform, ARIMAX and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) (W-S-LSSVM) was developed. The proposed model was designed to handle linear, nonlinear and seasonality of rainfall time series. In the proposed model, time series were decomposed into sub-series (approximation (a) and details (d)). Next, the sub-series were predicted separately. In the proposed model, sub-series were fed into SARIMAX to be predicted. The residual of predicted sub-series (error) of the rainfall time series was then fed into LSSVM to predict the residual components. Then, all predicted values were aggregated to rebuild the predicted time series. In order to compare results, first a classic modeling was performed by LSSVM. Later, wavelet-based LSSVM was used to capture the peak values of rainfall. Results revealed that Daubechies 4 and decomposition level 4 (db(4,4)) led to the best outcome. Due to the performance of db(4,4), it was selected to be applied in the proposed model. Based on results, it was observed that the W-S-LSSVM's performance was improved in comparison with other models.

Our aim was to study the critical question of how endozoochory rates change throughout the annual cycle, and how this relates to plant life-form and phenology. Location Lake Velence, Hungary. Time period 2017-2018. Major taxa studied Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Angiospermae, Charophyta. Methods We studied waterfowl endozoochory, quantifying seeds and other diaspores dispersed by mallards by collecting faecal samples monthly (n(total) = 670) at a Hungarian lake. We tested the germinability of all seeds recovered from the faecal samples. Main conclusions We extracted 5,760 seeds representing 35 plant taxa from mallard faecal samples, and 40% of these seeds germinated successfully following gut passage. We found major differences between seasons in the species composition of the seeds recovered. The peak in species diversity and in abundance of terrestrial seeds coincided with the spring migration of mallards. Importantly, endozoochory was only strongly synchronized with seed production in submerged, but not in emergent or terrestrial plants, illustrating the potential for endozoochory of seeds ingested from the soil seed bank. Overall, our results suggest that endozoochory by migratory waterfowl is a strong and underestimated driver of plant distributions, and is likely to facilitate plant range shifts under climate change, and after introduction of alien species.					vincze, orsolya/AEQ-1159-2022; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008; Lovas-Kiss, Ádám/J-3746-2019; Andras, Nagy/AAH-8789-2019; Lukács, Balázs/N-1702-2019	Lukacs, Balazs Andras/0000-0002-3163-1281; Vincze, Orsolya/0000-0001-5789-2124; 													1466-822X	1466-8238				JAN	2023	32	1					70	82		10.1111/geb.13608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13608		NOV 2022											WOS:000881857600001

Crocodiles occur in lakes and pools along seasonal rivers that form an inner hydrographical network. Reported movements of individuals during the summer floods suggested that it is necessary to protect the whole 700 km-long hydrological network to preserve inter-pool connectivity. However, the basin is occupied by 40,000 people that are completely dependent on water from the hydrological network. Thus it was important to propose a reserve network that would reconcile both the protection of biodiversity and human use of water resources. Considering the symbolic role of crocodiles for many Mauritanians, the acceptance of their presence by the people of Tagant, and the increasing use by tourism agencies of some pools for crocodile-watching, the species may be a good focal species for promoting the conservation of the whole hydrological network of the Tagant Plateau.

Field Studies of Non-Linear Internal Waves in Lakes on the Globe	NONLINEAR INTERNAL WAVES IN LAKES	Advances in Geophysical and Environmental Mechanics and Mathematics											This chapter is devoted to the experimental techniques commonly applied in field studies of nonlinear internal waves in lakes of the world. It consists of four sections. The first attempts an overview of internal waves in many lakes on the globe and provides a summarising sketch of common measuring techniques and methods of graphical representation of collected results. The second takes a closer view on experimental methods of field observation, most being invasive, but we equally also address the modern remote-sensing techniques, which open promising, perhaps still challenging, procedures allowing a closer look at internal wave phenomena. More substantially, the specific features of the patterns of manifestation, i.e., generation and dissipation of nonlinear internal waves in lakes of different size and shape under various sets of environmental conditions, are considered. It is shown that planning experiments on nonlinear internal waves in large lakes are a far more challenging task than for smaller lakes since the range of thermodynamic processes and phenomena is much more complex, and so is the set of hydrometeorological conditions (forcing) in stratified lakes. The third section focuses on internal wave dynamics of Lake Onego and its internal wave response during the summers of 2004/2005 and presents an exploitation of the data during the two summer field campaigns in the context of internal wave processes. The field experiments performed with the intention to investigate the generation and dissipation of nonlinear internal waves in Lake Onego are described in detail. These data are in the fourth section compared with models of nonlinear waves, which rounds out this chapter on internal waves in Lake Onego.					; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Vlasenko, Vasyl/ABF-5872-2020	Vlasenko, Vasyl/0000-0002-1889-5493; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; 													1866-8348		978-3-642-23437-8				2012							23	103		10.1007/978-3-642-23438-5_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23438-5_2	10.1007/978-3-642-23438-5												WOS:000303780600002

Tourism climatology for camping: a case study of two Ontario parks (Canada)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Climate and weather act as central motivators for the travel decisions of tourists. Due to their seasonality, these factors determine the availability and quality of certain outdoor recreational activities. Park visitation in Ontario, Canada, has been identified as a weather sensitive tourism and recreation activity. This study used a survey-based approach to identify and compare stated weather preferences and thresholds, as well as weather-related decision-making for campers at two provincial parks in Ontario, Canada. The two parks were selected for differing physical and environmental characteristics (forested lake versus coastal beach). Statistically significant differences were detected between the two parks in relation to the importance of weather and weather-based decision-making. Specific temperatures that were considered ideal and thresholds that were too cool and too warm were identified for both parks, both during the day and the night. Heavy rain and strong winds were the most influential factors in weather-related decision-making and on-site behavioural adaptations. Beach campers placed greater importance on the absence of rain and the presence of comfortable temperatures compared to forest campers. In addition, beach campers were more likely to leave the park early due to incremental weather changes. The results of this study suggest that beach campers are more sensitive to weather than forest campers.					; Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020; Gough, William/L-5231-2013	Hewer, Micah/0000-0003-4524-8184; Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2015	121	3-4					401	411		10.1007/s00704-014-1228-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1228-6													WOS:000359055800001

Addressing this issue requires a better understanding of MeHg production, fate during transport, and uptake into foodwebs. We used methylation assays and spatiotemporal surveys of MeHg concentrations, during the ice-covered and open water seasons, across a hydrologic continuum (composed of thaw seeps, lake/ponds, and a wetland) to identify Hg methylation hotspots and seasonal differences in MeHg cycling unique to Arctic ecosystems. Ponds and saturated wetland soils support methylation hotspots during the open water season, but subsequent export of MeHg to downstream ecosystems is limited by particle settling, binding of MeHg on soil organic matter, and/or demethylation in drier wetland soils. During the ice-covered season, MeHg concentrations in lake waters were approximately ten-fold greater than in summer; however, zooplankton MeHg concentrations were paradoxically five times lower at this time. Despite limited evidence of snow-phase methylation, the snowpack is an important MeHg reservoir. Changes in ice-cover duration will alter MeHg production and bioaccumulation in lakes, while increased thaw and surface water flow will likely result in higher methylation rates at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and more efficient downstream transport of MeHg.

J	Bryhn, AC; Blenckner, T				Bryhn, Andreas C.; Blenckner, Thorsten			Can nitrogen gas be deficient for nitrogen fixation in lakes?	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Severe nitrogen gas (N-2) depletion in lakes may have implications for N-2 fixation and for model structures describing the nitrogen (N) cycle. To determine whether this is likely to occur, we first reviewed the general processes influencing the N-2 cycle in lakes. Second, we empirically analysed N-2 concentrations in various stations and depths of Lake Erken, Sweden during the beginning and the end of the summer stratification period of 2004. Overall, no significant deviations from N-2 saturation from any stations or depths were observed during the study period. Third, we developed a simple, one-box gas model to investigate possible effects on lake water from processes described in the literature that affect the N-2 concentration. Simulations indicated that bottom waters and other isolated water bodies may show strong deviations from N-2 saturation during certain conditions differing from those during summers in Lake Erken. Simulated surface waters were always N-2 saturated in all types of lakes where the water column was in direct contact with the air. We quantified all probable fluxes, showed that the N-2 concentration in surface waters vastly exceeds the half-saturation constant for N uptake by phytoplankton, and concluded that it is unlikely that N-2 fixation is ever limited by the N-2 concentration. Modellers of lake eutrophication may regard N-2 as being available in excess. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we collected soil moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity data at different depths at a sampling site on Bird Island in Qinghai Lake during winter using a continuous soil temperature, moisture and salt content monitoring system and analyzed their variations and influential factors. The variation in soil moisture showed an obvious 'V-shaped' pattern from 00:00 to 23:00 and an upward trend with soil layer depth. From 00:00 to 23:00, the overall soil temperature data fitted a 'unimodal' curve and showed a clear and continuous upward trend with soil layer depth at a rate of 0.684 (p < 0.001). Soil electrical conductivity data also exhibited a distinct 'V-shaped' pattern from 00:00 to 23:00 and a continuous increase with increasing soil depth. The correlation between soil temperature, moisture, and conductivity and the spatial distribution of five climate factors indicated that climate factors accounted for 53.6% of the changes in soil temperature, moisture, and salinity. Climate factors showed a significant positive correlation with soil temperature, moisture, and conductivity (p < 0.001), and air temperature was the most important factor influencing soil temperature and soil moisture changes, whereas wind direction was the most important factor influencing soil conductivity. (Wind direction and wind speed affect soil evapotranspiration, and then affect soil moisture and solute transport process). The results of this preliminary study reveal the characteristics associated with soil temperature, moisture, and salinity changes in winter within the wetlands of Bird Island on Qinghai Lake in the context of climate change, and they can be used as valuable reference data in further studies investigating associated changes in ecosystem functions.					wang, xinye/GZN-0043-2022; Cao, Guangchao/AAB-1263-2020															2071-1050				AUG	2022	14	15							9449	10.3390/su14159449	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159449													WOS:000840254300001

CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF LADYBUG WASHUPS IN THE FINGER LAKES REGION OF NEW YORK STATE (COLEOPTERA: COCCINELLIDAE)	ENTOMOLOGICA AMERICANA												We searched for and collected data on a phenomenon known as ladybug washups, in which large numbers of coccinellids aggregate on the shores of major bodies of water. Our field season lasted from 5/23/2008 until 8/12/2008 in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, United States. Ladybug diversity and survival at washups, as well as washup size and frequency were studied to help understand why these events occur. Lab tests were conducted to determine how long ladybugs can survive afloat. This information was used to estimate the duration of floating in the washups we observed. The frequency, composition, and duration of washups in the Finger Lakes support the hypothesis that a weather condition known as a lake breeze forces coccinellids to fall into the water. These animals subsequently arrive on shore in large numbers. This study adds three new species to the growing list of coccinellids affected by this phenomenon.																			1947-5136						2010	116	1-2					78	88		10.1664/09-RA-008R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1664/09-RA-008R.1													WOS:000280494600006

Very high levels of total Hg are observed in the watercolumn (up to 20 ng L(-1)) and the sediments (up to 244 mug g(-1)) close to the deposit area, but almost normal levels (1.8 ng L(-1) in the water column and 0.14 mug g(-1) in the sediments) are reached 60 km downstream of that zone. In general, low dissolved methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations were found (0.04-0.05 ng L(-1)) due to unfavourable methylation conditions. The MMHg concentrations in the sediments vary from 23.3 ng g(-1), in the vicinity of the geological Hg deposits, to 0.17 ng g(-1) 60 km downstream. Total Hg levels in Lake Teletskoye (a geological active area) are slightly increased (1.1-1.8 ng L(-1)) compared to Lake Baikal and fairly constant alover the Lake, suggesting multiple sources. High mercury concentrations in springs and soils coincide with high radon concentrations in the same compartments as well as high soil exhalation fluxes. These results in combination with the fact that Lake Teletskoye is located in an active fault zone suggest that the Rn and Hg sources may be fault aligned spring waters and deep seated gases escaping through open cracks. Methylmercury concentrations in the Lake (0.03-0.1 ng L(-1)) were comparable to the concentrations found in Katun river but relative to the total Hg burden this means a higher percentage.					; Baeyens, Willy/A-9366-2010; Bobrov, Vladislav/A-5303-2014	Dehandschutter, Boris/0000-0001-5674-9502; Baeyens, Willy/0000-0002-5281-903X; 													0049-6979						2003	142	1-4					375	393		10.1023/A:1022099410739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022099410739													WOS:000181303900023

Fine-scale heterogeneity drives forest use by spring migrant landbirds across a broad, contiguous forest matrix	CONDOR												Much of our understanding of en route landbird habitat use comes from research performed at local scales, ignoring effects at larger spatial scales. We used a multiscale approach to investigate stopover habitat use by landbirds using transect surveys in 68 forested sites in southwestern Michigan, USA, during the springs of 2002 and 2003. We modeled relationships of bird density and arthropod abundance with broad-scale spatiotemporal factors (year, day of year, geographic location) and local landscape (forest composition and structure, presence of open water) as well as site-scale factors (bird density and arthropod abundance, which exchanged roles as predictor and response variables). We found migrant densities to be most influenced by fine-scale factors, such as the abundance of other avian taxa and substrate arthropods, followed by broader-scale factors, such as forest structure and location, within the local and broader surrounding landscape. We found that migrant habitat associations either did not directly match or were weakly associated with the availability of riparian or lacustrine water habitats at a local scale, even though our results suggested that birds using these habitat cues would have encountered more arthropods. Rather than finding indirect measures of food abundance-such as distance to a water source or forest cover at the landscape scale-important, our models best explained bird density by a direct relationship with site-scale food resources. Thus, the scale at which migrants demonstrate habitat selection appears to be influenced by proximate mechanisms such as high-quality habitat availability and the presence of large ecological features within the landscape. Not only do factors operating at multiple scales influence how birds use habitats, but scale also influences how we interpret research findings, in turn influencing conservation decisions.					; Smith, Robert/C-1002-2009; Buler, Jeffrey/H-3207-2019	Buler, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2696-847X; Zenzal, Theodore/0000-0001-7342-1373; 														1938-5129				FEB	2018	120	1					166	184		10.1650/CONDOR-17-33.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-17-33.1													WOS:000424772100012
J	Zhang, J; Li, L; Li, DL; Deng, WT				Zhang, Jie; Li, Laurent; Li, Dongliang; Deng, Weitao			Summer droughts in the northern Yellow River basin in association with recent Arctic ice loss	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Drought is one of the most devastating natural disasters occurring in the Yellow River basin (YRB) in Central and North China, with strong impacts on human societies and natural environments. Based on datasets from ECMWF/ERA-Interim on atmospheric circulation and sea level pressure and on rainfall data from meteorological networks from 1979 to 2013, droughts in the YRB are investigated in the present work. Rainfall in summer in the northern YRB (semi-arid and semi-humid zones) has been low since 1990, which is associated with an anomaly of planetary waves around Lake Baikal. These waves are significantly affected by Arctic ice loss (particularly in the eastern Arctic) among other factors. Eastern Arctic ice loss results in a warmer surface and increases air temperatures over the Arctic and northern Siberia. These conditions are favourable for cyclonic anomalies in the lower troposphere, generating an ascending flow anomaly over the eastern Arctic and a positive anomaly of meridional wind in the low troposphere between high latitudes and the Arctic. This situation results in a weaker Polar cell and a stronger Ferrel cell in the three-cell latitudinal circulation, due to increasing the ascending flow at approximately 60 degrees N as well as the descending flow at approximately 35 degrees-53 degrees N. These conditions favour reinforcement as well as the width of subtropical high pressures, meridional shifts or northward elongation, the anomaly of planetary wave ridges around Lake Baikal, finally, more severe droughts in the northern YRB. Simulations performed with an atmospheric general circulation model confirm that Arctic sea ice loss can induce a northward shift and enhancement of subtropical high pressures, together with decreasing rainfall in the mid-latitudes of both North America and East Asia, especially in the northern YRB.

Zooplankton samplings were performed in spring in four sites, located from up- to downstream along the river course. Four low-flow velocity station points were chosen along a transversal river section in each site. Samples were taken from all station points in the four sites by two different mesh sizes (55 and 100 pm) rectangular nets. Rotifer abundances were an order of magnitude higher in 55 mu m mesh size samples than in 100 pm mesh size ones. The two communities also resulted significantly different (ANOSIM test, rho = 0.212; P=0.1%). Generally, low abundances (from 3470 +/- 5133 to 422 +/- 474 ind.m(-3)) were explained by low chlorophyll a concentration and the high-flow regime of this river. Rotifer dominated the zooplankton community. Cladocerans, copepods and nauplii occurred with considerably lower abundances than rotifers. However, the relative contributions of these taxa to total abundances depended on the mesh sizes used. Euchlanis and Adineta genera exhibited the highest abundances in the rotifer assemblage. Conductivity alone or in association with temperature and dissolved oxygen was the most important environmental factor affecting rotifer community distribution. Cephdodella sp., Lepadella sp. and Trichotria pocillum showed a high positive relation to pico-plankton, showing this fraction as a possible rotifer food item. This paper demonstrated a higher efficiency of the finest net to characterize riverine zooplankton community that increases from up to downstream in terms of abundances and diversity.					; Brugnano, Cinzia/AAE-5354-2019	ZAGAMI, Giacomo/0000-0001-5083-8846; GUGLIELMO, Letterio/0000-0001-7547-8058; GRANATA, Antonia/0000-0001-7016-6418													0003-4088	2100-000X					2013	49	4					287	300		10.1051/limn/2013061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2013061													WOS:000329478600005

Within the assemblage, the Baltoscandian Fungochitina spinifera Biozone could be recognized, indicating a strong faunal exchange between the Baltica palaeocontinent and the Avalonian palaeomicrocontinent during the Late Ordovician. This biozone allowed a strong correlation with new chitinozoan biozonations in the Cautley district and Cross Fell Inlier, resulting in a late Onnian to early Cautleyan age for the Kirkley Bank Formation at Greenscoe.

Study of tributary inflows in Lake Iseo with a rotating physical model	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The influence of Coriolis force on the currents of large lakes is well acknowledged; very few contributions, however, investigate this aspect in medium-size lakes where its relevance could be questionable. In order to study the area of influence of the two major tributary rivers in Lake Iseo, a rotating vertically distorted physical model of the northern part of this lake was prepared and used, respecting both Froude and Rossby similarity. The model has a horizontal length scale factor of 8000 and a vertical scale factor of 500 and was used both in homogeneous and in thermally stratified conditions. We explored the pattern of water circulation in front of the entrance mouth for different hydrologic scenarios at the beginning of spring and in summer. We neglected the influence of winds. The primary purposes of the model were twofold: i) to increase our level of knowledge of the hydrodynamics of Lake Iseo by verifying the occurrence of dynamical effects related to the Earth's rotation on the plume of the two tributaries that enter the northern part of the lake and ii) to identify the areas of the lake that can be directly influenced by the tributaries' waters, in order to provide guidance on water quality monitoring in zones of relevant environmental and touristic value. The results of the physical model confirm the relevant role played by the Coriolis force in the northern part of the lake. Under ordinary flow conditions, the model shows a systematic deflection of the inflowing waters towards the western shore of the lake. The inflow triggers a clockwise gyre within the Lovere bay, to the West of the inflow, and a slow counter-clockwise gyre, to the East of the inflow, that returns water towards the river mouth along the eastern shore. For discharges with higher return period, when only the contribution by Oglio River is relevant, the effect of the Earth's rotation weakens in the entrance zone and the plume has a more rectilinear pattern, whilst in the far field the current driven by the inflows keeps moving along the western shore. On the basis of these results one could expect that the north-western part of the lake between Castro and Lovere, although not aligned with the tributaries' axes, is more sensitive to accumulation effects related to river-borne pollution. The results obtained with the physical model are critically compared with data obtained from different sources: the trajectory of a lagrangian drogue; a map of reflectivity data from the lake floor; a map of water turbidity at the intrusion depth. The findings are also confirmed by the results of a 3D numerical model of the lake.

J	Pointner, G; Bartsch, A				Pointner, Georg; Bartsch, Annett			Mapping Arctic Lake Ice Backscatter Anomalies Using Sentinel-1 Time Series on Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING												Seepage of geological methane through sediments of Arctic lakes might contribute conceivably to the atmospheric methane budget. However, the abundance and precise locations of such seeps are poorly quantified. For Lake Neyto, one of the largest lakes on the Yamal Peninsula in Northwestern Siberia, temporally expanding regions of anomalously low backscatter in C-band SAR imagery acquired in late winter and spring have been suggested to be related to seepage of methane from hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, this hypothesis has not been verified using in-situ observations so far. Similar anomalies have also been identified for other lakes on Yamal, but it is still uncertain whether or how many of them are related to methane seepage. This study aimed to document similar lake ice backscatter anomalies on a regional scale over four study regions (the Yamal Peninsula and Tazovskiy Peninsulas; the Lena Delta in Russia; the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska) during different years using a time series based approach on Google Earth Engine (GEE) that quantifies changes of sigma(0) from the Sentinel-1 C-band SAR sensor over time. An algorithm for assessing the coverage that takes the number of acquisitions and maximum time between acquisitions into account is presented, and differences between the main operating modes of Sentinel-1 are evaluated. Results show that better coverage can be achieved in extra wide swath (EW) mode, but interferometric wide swath (IW) mode data could be useful for smaller study areas and to substantiate EW results. A classification of anomalies on Lake Neyto from EW Delta sigma(0) images derived from GEE showed good agreement with the classification presented in a previous study. Automatic threshold-based per-lake counting of years where anomalies occurred was tested, but a number of issues related to this approach were identified. For example, effects of late grounding of the ice and anomalies potentially related to methane emissions could not be separated efficiently. Visualizations of Delta sigma(0) images likely reflect the temporal expansions of anomalies and are expected to be particularly useful for identifying target areas for future field-based research. Characteristic anomalies that clearly resemble the ones observed for Lake Neyto could be identified solely visually in the Yamal and Tazovskiy study regions. All data and algorithms produced in the framework of this study are openly provided to the scientific community for future studies and might potentially aid our understanding of geological lake seepage upon the progression of related field-based studies and corresponding evaluations of formation hypotheses.					; Bartsch, Annett/G-6332-2012	Pointner, Georg/0000-0003-2539-3827; Bartsch, Annett/0000-0002-3737-7931														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	9							1626	10.3390/rs13091626	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13091626													WOS:000650745900001

Samplings were conducted in two cyanobacterial bloom periods (May and August) and no algal-blooms period (November) of 2014, representing three different operational stages of the reservoir, i.e., reservoir discharge period, fluctuating period in the summer flood season, and high water level in the impoundment period. Phyto- and bacterioplankton exhibit a wide range of variability along the depth profiles of the water column. In the investigated two cyanobacterial bloom periods, prokaryotes accounted for over 50% of the total phytoplankton. As for bacterioplankton, low nucleic acid bacteria were dominant in August and November. A positive correlation was observed between phytoplankton (pico- and nanophytoplankton), Chl a, and bacterioplankton. High nucleic acid groups and prokaryotes were highly coupled in May and August, which indicated that this high nucleic acid group could probably contribute to the explanation of cyanobacterial bloom formation in this area.

J	Burbank, DW; Bookhagen, B; Gabet, EJ; Putkonen, J				Burbank, Douglas W.; Bookhagen, Bodo; Gabet, Emmanuel J.; Putkonen, Jaakko			Modern climate and erosion in the Himalaya	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												Between June and September each year, the Indian monsoon typically delivers about 80% of the Nepalese Himalaya's annual precipitation. Topography on the windward (southern) flank of the range modulates persistent spatial variations in precipitation along the length of the range. Where topography is stepped with an initial abrupt rise as the Himalaya abut the foreland and a second rise as topography ascends toward the high peaks, two bands of high precipitation prevail, each where relief passes a threshold value. In contrast, more uniform, northward rising topography localizes a single high-rainfall band near the front of the range. A dense meteorological network that was operated in the Marsyandi catchment from 1999 to 2004 in central Nepal gives more insight on spatial variability in precipitation. Annual precipitation decreases ten-fold between the rainfall peak (of similar to 4 m/yr) on the southern flank of the Himalaya and the semi-arid rain shadow on its northern flank (40-50 km farther north). Modest contrasts in rainfall between ridges versus valleys during the monsoon are replaced by strong altitude-dependent precipitation contrasts in the winter. Strikingly, above similar to 4 km altitude, similar to 40% of the total precipitation arrives as winter snowfall. Four years of daily discharge and suspended sediment measurements on the main-stem and on several tributaries of the Marsyandi during the monsoon document a strong north-south gradient in average erosion rates. Based on a suspended-to-bedload ratio of 2:1 (as estimated from grain-sizes in a landslide-dammed paleo-lake), erosion rates range from similar to 0.1 mm/yr in the northern rain shadow to similar to 2 mm/yr in the monsoon-drenched south. This strong modern spatial gradient in erosion rates mimics the precipitation gradient across the same area and broadly scales with specific discharge. In the wetter regions, nearly a meter of rain is required before significant sediment fluxes occur. After this initial meter of rain, the daily rainfall required to trigger sediment pulses (attributable to landsliding) gradually decreases during the remaining monsoon season from similar to 40 mm to 10 mm. In the higher altitude rain shadow to the north, water discharge is more closely linked to temperature than to precipitation: a linkage suggesting that melting of snow and ice, rather than rainfall, modulates the runoff. The sediment flux in the rain shadow during the monsoon season displays a marked temporal hysteresis: fluxes broadly scale with discharge during the first two months of the monsoon, but decouple from discharge later in the monsoon. This behavior suggests that the sediment flux is supply limited. We interpret that much of the sediment is subglacially derived and that its transport into the river network is restricted either by limited bedrock erosion or subglacial hydrology.

Vegetation changes at "Fundu Mare Island" in the Inner Danube Delta near Braila (Romania)	RIVER FLOW 2016					8th International Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics (River Flow)	JUL 11-14, 2016	St Louis, MO	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, IIHR Hydroscience & Engn, Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr Alton, NSF, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, AGU, Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab, Saint Louis Univ, Sequoia Sci Inc, Sontek				The Lower Danube River System has been heavily affected by human activities. Fundu Mare Island in the Natural Park Small Wetland of Braila (Romania) is one of few islands in a nearly natural state and an important nature protection area. About 50% of the area is covered by aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The lakes on the island are usually flooded in spring and their water level drops during the following months depending on the Danube water levels. During the last few years a massive willow encroachment has been observed on the island in some formerly open habitats. In the present paper, we report on-going vegetation changes by comparing previously mapped nature with recent observations and discuss hydrological and hydro-dynamical factors that may have affected the development. The results suggest that, together with other factors, changes in the flow regime of the Danube during the growing season play an important role for the vegetation changes at Fundu Mare Island.

River-water, shallow-groundwater and lake-water samples from the Gomati River Basin were analyzed. During the winter season, the delta O-18 and delta D compositions of the Gomati River water ranged from -1.67 to -7.62 aEuro degrees and -25.08 to -61.50 aEuro degrees, respectively. Deuterium excess values in the river water (+0.3 to -13 aEuro degrees) and the lake water (-20 aEuro degrees) indicate the significance of evaporation processes. Monthly variation of delta O-18 and delta D values of the Gomati River water and the shallow groundwater follows a similar trend, with isotope-depleted peaks for delta O-18 and delta D synchronized during the monsoon season. The isotopically depleted peak values of the river water (delta O-18 = -8.30 aEuro degrees and delta D = -57.10 aEuro degrees) can be used as a proxy record for the isotopic signature of the monsoon precipitation in the Ganga Alluvial Plain.

The analysis was performed using the model of microwave radiation of plane layered heterogeneous nonisothermal medium. The input parameters for the model were real regional climatological characteristics and glaciological parameters of ice cover of the study lakes. Three distinct seasonal brightness temperature time regions corresponding to different phenological phases of the lake surfaces: complete ice cover, ice melt and deterioration, and open water were revealed. The paper demonstrates the possibility to determine the beginning of ice cover deterioration from satellite microwave radiometry data. The obtained results can be useful for setting the operating terms of winter crossings and roads on ice, as with the beginning of ice deterioration, these transportation routes across water bodies (rivers, lakes, water reservoirs) become insecure and cannot be used any more.

The phytoplankton populations of Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake), North Wales, UK	NOVA HEDWIGIA												Temperature, dissolved oxygen, light transmission, phytoplankton chlorophyll a and phytoplankton populations were studied in the deep, glacially formed Llyn Tegid (Wales, UK) from 1997-2000. The lake was directly but sometimes only weakly stratified in summer. Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion was most severe in September 1998 (< 1 mg O-2 1(-1) in the deepest 5 m). Light transmission was reduced by dissolved organic carbon compounds, with a euphotic zone ending between 4 and 8m, about one fifth of the depth profile and less than the summer mixed depth. Chlorophyll a was frequently below 5 mg 1(-1), with peaks up to about 10 mg 1(-1). The lake is regarded as `mesotrophic'. Of 62 phytoplankton taxa, 11 were diatoms (Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira distans, Rhizosolenia longiseta and Fragilaria crotonensis were most frequent), there was a variety of small chrysophyte flagellates and cryptomonads (Rhodomonas lacustris) and of green algae with Chlorella minutissima and Didymococcus bicellularis most common. Picoplankton was scarce, anomalously for such a lake. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria included the dominant Anabaena circinalis (1997), Oscillatoria agardhii (1998) and Anabaena flos-aquae (1999). Ceratium hirundinella was the most common dinoflagellate, with populations annually increasing over the period. The lake has shown signs of eutrophication, mostly from diffuse catchment sources in the past few decades.																			0029-5035						2006				130			35	49																WOS:000239016300004

ASSESSMENT OF QX AND WINTER MORTALITY DISEASE RESISTANCE OF MASS SELECTED SYDNEY ROCK OYSTERS, SACCOSTREA GLOMERATA (GOULD, 1850), IN THE HAWKESBURY RIVER AND MERIMBULA LAKE, NSW AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												The Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, mass selection breeding program was established in 1990 in the Georges River, New South Wales, and has successfully developed lines of oysters resistant to QX disease (Marteilia sydneyi) and winter mortality disease (WM; Bonamia roughleyi). Each new generation is assessed in the Georges River, but the performance of these oysters in other estuaries affected by these diseases is unknown. To investigate the potential for genotype and environment interactions, and to assure farmers, survival and growth of progeny of the fourth-generation breeding lines developed in Georges River were assessed in two other key farming areas; the Hawkesbury River and Merimbula Lake, NSW, Australia. Hawkesbury River is affected by QX and was used to assess the QX-resistant oysters (QXr). Merimbula Lake is affected by WM, and this estuary was used to assess the WM-resistant oysters (WMr) and the dual WM and QX resistant line(WM + QXr). Oysters that are QXr in the Hawkesbury River, and the WMr oysters in Merimbula Lake, had significantly lower mortality and faster growth compared with controls at the final measurement. Oysters that are QXr in the Hawkesbury River at the Marra Marra Creek and Kimmerikong Bay sites attained the 50-g "plate grade" benchmark after 24 mo of culture and had lost only 29.4% and 16.9% of oysters originally stocked, respectively. Meanwhile, QX caused losses of 93.7% and 95.7% in controls at these 2 sites, respectively. In Merimbula Lake, at the conclusion of the experiment WMr oysters were significantly heavier, were larger, and had significantly lower mortality than WM + QXr and control oysters. Growth and survival of WMr, WM + QXr, and QXr oysters were comparable with that measured in the Georges River.					; Dove, Michael/B-4299-2008; O'Connor, Wayne/AAL-8097-2020	O'Connor, Wayne/0000-0002-0972-4668; 													0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	2013	32	3					681	687		10.2983/035.032.0309	http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.032.0309													WOS:000331554700009

Summer sedimentation in six shallow arctic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The movement of sediment between the lake bottom and water column of shallow lakes can be sizeable due to the large potential for resuspension in these systems. Resuspended sediments have been shown to alter phytoplankton community composition and elevate water column production and nutrient concentrations. We measured the summer sedimentation rates of two lakes in 2003 and six lakes in 2004. All lakes were shallow and located in the Alaskan Arctic. In 2004, turbidity, light attenuation, total sediment:chlorophyll a mass in the sediment traps, and thermal stratification were also measured in each of the lakes. The sediment:chlorophyll a mass was much greater than if the sediment was derived from phytoplankton production in all of the lakes, indicating that the source of the sedimenting material was resuspension and allochthonous inputs. Consistent with these findings, the temporal variation in sedimentation rate was synchronous between most lakes, and sedimentation rate was positively related to wind speed and rainfall suggesting that sedimentation rate was strongly influenced by landscape-scale factors (e.g., wind and rain events). Two of the lakes are located on deposits of loess that accumulated during past glacial periods. These two lakes had sedimentation rates that were significantly greater and more variable than any of the other lakes in the study, as well as high turbidity and light attenuation. Our results indicate that sedimentation in these shallow arctic lakes is supported primarily by allochthonous inputs and resuspension and that landscape-scale factors (e.g., weather and geology) impact on the transport of materials between the lake bottom and water column.

Yu			Methane hydrate emergence from Lake Baikal: direct observations, modelling, and hydrate footprints in seasonal ice cover	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												This paper provides a novel report of methane hydrates rising from bottom sediments to the surface of Lake Baikal, validated by photo and video records. The ascent of hydrates in the water column was confirmed by hydroacoustic data showing rising objects with velocities significantly exceeding the typical speeds (18-25 cm s(-1)) of gas bubbles. Mathematical modelling along with velocity and depth estimates of the presumed methane hydrates coincided with values observed from echograms. Modelling results also showed that a methane hydrate fragment with initial radius of 2.5 cm or greater could reach the surface of Lake Baikal given summer water column temperature conditions. Results further show that while methane bubbles released from the deep sedimentary reservoir would dissolve in the Lake Baikal water column, transport in hydrate form is not only viable but may represent a previously overlooked source of surface methane with subsequent emissions to the atmosphere. Methane hydrates captured within the ice cover may also cause the formation of unique ice structures and morphologies observed around Lake Baikal. Sampling of these ice structures detected methane content that exceeded concentrations measured in surrounding ice and from the atmosphere demonstrating a link with the methane transport processes described here.					; Makarov, Mikhail/J-4851-2018; Ivanov, Vyacheslav/AAY-5196-2021; Aslamov, Ilya/ABI-6146-2020; Granin, Nikolay/J-4801-2018; McGinnis, Daniel/G-1389-2011; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	Ivanov, Vyacheslav/0000-0002-6524-1169; Makarov, Mikhail/0000-0002-1758-4458; Granin, Nikolay/0000-0002-7976-9060; Kucher, Konstantin/0000-0002-5978-0107; McGinnis, Daniel/0000-0002-6163-4299; Aslamov, Ilya/0000-0001-6678-5312													2045-2322					DEC 18	2019	9								19361	10.1038/s41598-019-55758-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55758-8								31852934					WOS:000507594500001

Characterizing late Quaternary lake-level variability in Lago de Tota, Colombian Andes, with CHIRP seismic stratigraphy	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Geophysical analysis of lacustrine sediment stratigraphy at Lago de Tota (Tota), Boyaca, Colombia provided evidence for significant lake-level fluctuations through the late Quaternary and produced a record that potentially spans the last 60 ka. CHIRP data collected in 2015 from this large, high-elevation lake in the Eastern Cordillera of the northern hemisphere Colombian Andes reveal a series of off-lap and on-lap sequences in the upper 20 m of the lake's sediment column that indicate large amplitude changes in lake level. Because C-14 dated sediment cores are only available for the upper 3 m of the sediment column, known Holocene sedimentation rates were extrapolated in order to assign preliminary ages to the off-lap and on-lap sequence boundaries below 3 m depth. These data suggest that lake levels at Tota were lower than present during marine isotope stage (MIS) 4 between 60 and 57 ka, relatively high during MIS 3 between 57 and 29 ka, fell to their lowest levels during MIS 2 between 29 and 14 ka, and gradually rose to the modern high stand through a series of transgressions during MIS 1 and the Holocene from 14 ka to the present. These fluctuations are broadly consistent with trends observed in other lake-level reconstructions from the northern (in phase) and southern (out of phase) hemisphere Andes, possibly supporting the idea that millennial-to-orbital-scale South American hydroclimate variability is linked to shifts in the mean latitude of the intertropical convergence zone due to the influence of insolation- and ocean circulation-driven hemispheric temperature gradients during glacial/stadial and interglacial/interstadial events. Although additional geochronological data will be needed to better resolve the timing of the Tota lake-level changes and their relationships with other records, these preliminary results from Tota, as well as the presence of a thick (> 300 m) sedimentary archive, indicate that this site has significant potential to produce high-resolution, quantitative, paleo-hydroclimate data spanning much of the last 1 million years. Because geophysical surveys and long paleoclimate records from northern hemisphere South America are exceedingly rare, these data provide critical insight into regional hydroclimate trends through the Late Quaternary. Additional work, such as the collection of sediment cores spanning the depth interval represented in the CHIRP data, is required, however, in order to place firmer chronological constraints on the hypothesized timing of lake-level fluctuations at Tota and to investigate their paleo-hydroclimatic implications.					; Velasco, Felipe/JCO-9237-2023; Wattrus, Nigel/K-7575-2012; Polissar, Pratigya/L-8131-2013; Escobar, Jaime/HSE-4459-2023	Polissar, Pratigya/0000-0001-5483-1625; Gibson, Derek/0000-0001-6129-8902; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2019	62	4					319	335		10.1007/s10933-019-00089-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00089-x													WOS:000494824700002

In this study, seasonal variations on three types of sediments from central lake, dredged and algae accumulated areas in a eutrophic lake in China, Lake Taihu, were investigated. The high temperature in summer and the accumulation of algae are conducive to the reduction processes in freshwater lake sediments. Iron reduction was observed as the major anaerobic process in all types of sediments, while sulfate reduction was weak in central and dredged lake areas. However, strong sulfate reduction with increase of sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfides generation (119.5 +/- 0.2 mu mol L-1) was found in surface sediments in algae accumulated areas. Based on the results of Fe reduction rate and the quantity of Fe reducing bacteria, extensive sulfate reduction in algae accumulated sediments inhibited the microbial Fe reduction, and the Sigma S2--mediated chemical Fe reduction (SCIR) dominated instead. Iron was principally stored in the sediments as Fe sulfide compounds, which weakened the rebinding of phosphorus and stimulated phosphorus mobilization. Therefore, attention should be paid to the alteration of Fe cycling and phosphorus mobility caused by the SCIR in algae accumulated sediments and the consequent effects on the eutrophication of freshwater lakes.

The Ein-Qedem (EQ) hydrothermal saline springs system discharging at the western shores of the modern Dead Sea is the modern manifestation of this essential and continuous process. The EQ springs comprise the most significant source of Ca-chloride brine that currently discharges into the lake. The chemical composition of EQ brine has remained virtually uniform during the past ca. 40 yr, indicating that the brine represents a large groundwater reservoir. The EQ brine evolved from ancient Ca-chloride brine that occupied the tectonic depression of the Dead Sea Basin during the Quaternary. During this period, the composition of lake's brine was affected by mixing with freshwater and formation of primary minerals. Based on chronological and geochemical data, we argue that the EQ brine comprises the epilimnetic solution of last glacial Lake Lisan that penetrated and circulated through the adjacent Judea Group aquifer. C-14 and Kr-81 dating indicates recharge ages spanning the time interval of similar to 40-20 ka, coinciding with the period when the lake reached its highest stand (of similar to 200 +/- 30 m below msl, at similar to 31-17.4 ka) and maintained a stable layered (stratified) configuration for a period of several ten thousand years. The presented evidence suggests that the circulation of the Ca-chloride brine involves penetration into the aquifer during high stands (EQ brine recharge) and its discharge back into the lake during the modern low stands (similar to 400 to 430 m below msl). Accordingly, the mechanism of brine circulation between the lake and the marginal aquifers is related to the long-term hydro-climate history of the Dead Sea basin and its vicinity.

Here, by combining entire summer season current and temperature observations and 3D numerical modeling, we demonstrate that previously undetected vertical mode-two and mode-three Poincare waves in 309-meter deep Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France) generate bottom-boundary layer currents up to 4 cm s(-1). Poincare wave amphidromic patterns revealed three strong cells excited simultaneously. Weak hypolimnetic stratification (N-2 approximate to 10(-6)s(-2)), typical of deep lakes, significantly modified the wave structure by shifting the lower vertical node in the lake's center from similar to 75-meter depth (without stratification) to similar to 150-meter depth (with stratification). This shift induces shear in the middle of the hypolimnion and strengthens bottom currents, with important implications for hypolimnetic mixing and sediment-water exchange. Our findings demonstrate that classical concepts based on constant temperature layers cannot correctly characterize higher vertical-mode Poincare seiches in deep lakes.

Lakes close to the inflow of river water show high concentrations of suspended sediments, whereas lakes isolated within the reedbed complexes have clear 'brown' water (high concentrations of humic substances). We describe the changes of phytoplankton, submerged vegetation, and plant-associated macro-invertebrates between early- and late season 2001, in inflow-, intermediate-, and isolated lakes. In September, all lakes showed high abundances of phytoplankton (cyanobacteria, diatoms) with coincident high turbidities. Potamogeton spp. disappeared from the vegetation during summer, whereas stands of Nitellopsis obtusa and Ceratophyllum demersum survived. As a consequence, lakes of intermediate connectivity lost their submerged vegetation; in contrast, isolated lakes remained dominated by vegetation. The observed seasonal development in lakes along the connectivity gradient can be explained as being the result of external processes (the flood-pulse) and internal responses (differential tolerance of the respective vegetation types).					; Covaliov, Silviu/X-7126-2019; Török, Liliana/B-6906-2014; Hanganu, Jenica/KHD-2279-2024	Covaliov, Silviu/0000-0002-0412-4102; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					651	656																WOS:000188455600084
J	Yao, J; Zhang, Q; Ye, XC; Zhang, D; Bai, P				Yao, Jing; Zhang, Qi; Ye, Xuchun; Zhang, Dan; Bai, Peng			Quantifying the impact of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regimes in a large floodplain lake: Poyang Lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydrological regime of a lake is largely dependent on its bathymetry. A dramatic water level reduction has occurred in Poyang Lake in recent years, coinciding with significant bed erosion. Few studies have focused on the influence of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in such a complex river-lake floodplain system. This study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes (1998-2010) on the water level spatiotemporal distribution in Poyang Lake, based on a dry year (2006), a wet year (2010) and an average year (2000-2010). The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study: (1) The bed erosion of the northern outlet channel averaged 3 m, resulting in a decrease in the water level by 1.2-2 m in the northern channels (the most significantly influenced areas) and approximately 0.3 m in the central lake areas during low-level periods. The water levels below 16 m and 14 m were significantly affected during the rising period and recession period, respectively. The water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels. (2) The water surface profiles adjusted, and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased by 0.5-3.1 cm/d at the lake outlet. The bathymetric influence extended across the entire lake due to the emptying effect, resulting in a change in the water level distribution. The average annual outflow increased by 6.8%. (3) The bathymetric changes contributed approximately 14.4% to the extreme low water level in autumn 2006 and enhanced the drought in the dry season. This study quantified the impact of the bathymetric changes on the lake water levels, thereby providing a better understanding of the potential effects of continued sand mining operations and providing scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of Poyang Lake. Moreover, this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes.

Surface-water/groundwater boundaries affect seasonal PFAS concentrations and PFAA precursor transformations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Elevated concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking-water supplies are a major concern for human health. It is therefore essential to understand factors that affect PFAS concentrations in surface water and groundwater and the transformation of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors that degrade into terminal compounds. Surface-water/groundwater exchange can occur along the flow path downgradient from PFAS point sources and biogeochemical conditions can change rapidly at these exchange boundaries. Here, we investigate the influence of surface-water/groundwater boundaries on PFAS transport and transformation. To do this, we conducted an extensive field-based analysis of PFAS concentrations in water and sediment from a flow-through lake fed by contaminated groundwater and its downgradient surface-water/groundwater boundary (defined as <= 100 cm below the lake bottom). PFAA precursors comprised 45 +/- 4.6% of PFAS (PFAA precursors + 18 targeted PFAA) in the predominantly oxic lake impacted by a former fire-training area and historical wastewater discharges. In shallow porewater downgradient from the lake, this percentage decreased significantly to 25 +/- 11%. PFAA precursor concentrations decreased by 85% between the lake and 84-100 cm below the lake bottom. PFAA concentrations increased significantly within the surface-water/groundwater boundary and in downgradient groundwater during the winter months despite lower stable concentrations in the lake water source. These results suggest that natural biogeochemical fluctuations associated with surface-water/groundwater boundaries may lead to PFAA precursor loss and seasonal variations in PFAA concentrations. Results of this work highlight the importance of dynamic biogeochemical conditions along the hydrological flow path from PFAS point sources to potentially affected drinking water supplies.

Based on these data the late glacial and Holocene sedimentological processes and variability in circulation and fiord environments are outlined. Glacial marine sedimentation prevailed in the Voldafjorden between 11.0 kyr and 9.2 kyr BP (radiocarbon years). In the later part of the Allerod period, and for the rest of the Holocene, there was deposition of fine-grained normal marine sediments in the fjord basin. Turbidite layers, recorded in core material and on acoustic profiles, dated to ca. 2.1, 6.9-7.6, ca. 9.6 and ca. 11.0 kyr BP, interrupted the marine sedimentation. The event dated to between 6.9 and 7.6 kyr BP probably corresponds to a tsunami resulting from large-scale sliding on the continental margin off Norway (the Storegga Tsunami). During the later part of the Allerod period, Voldafjorden had a strongly stratified water column with cold bottom water and warm surface water, reaching interglacial temperatures during the summer seasons. During the Younger Dryas cold event there was a return to arctic sea-surface summer temperatures, possibly with year-round sea-ice cover, the entire benthic fauna being composed of arctic species. The first strong Holocene warming, observed simultaneously in bottom and sea-surface temperature proxies, occurred at ca. 10.1 kyr BP. Bottom water proxies indicate two cold periods, possibly with 2 degreesC lowering of temperatures, at ca. 10.0 (PBO 1) and at 9.8 kyr BP (PBO 2). These events may both result from catastrophic outbursts of Baltic glacial lake water. The remainder of the Holocene experienced variability in basin water temperature, indicated by oxygen isotope measurements with an amplitude of ca. 2 degreesC, with cooler periods at ca. 8.4-9.0, 5.6, 5.2, 4.6, 4.2, 3.5, 2.2, 1.2 and 0.4-0.8 kyr BP. Changes in the fjord hydrology through the past 11.3 kyr show a close correspondence, both in amplitude and timing of events, recorded in cores from the Norwegian Sea region and the North Atlantic. These data suggest a close relationship between fjord environments and variability in large-scale oceanic circulation.

The model reproduces the broad temporal and spatial features of both variables in terms of spatial distribution, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability, including climatological characteristics of lake-effect snowfall, although the simulated ice cover is overly extensive largely due to the absence of lake circulations. A definition is introduced for identifying heavy lake-effect snowstorms in regional climate model output for all grid cells in the Great Lakes Basin, using criteria based on location, wind direction, lake ice cover, and snowfall. Simulated heavy lake-effect snowstorms occur most frequently downwind of the Great Lakes, particularly to the east of Lake Ontario and to the east and south of Lake Superior, and are most frequent in December-January. The mechanism for these events is attributed to an anticyclone over the central United States and related cold-air outbreak for areas downwind of Lakes Ontario and Erie, in contrast to a nearby cyclone over the Great Lakes Basin and associated cold front for areas downwind of Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan.

J	Gostomski, TJ; Evers, DC				Gostomski, TJ; Evers, DC			Time-activity budget for Common Loons, Gavia immer, nesting on Lake Superior	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Three pairs of color-marked Common Loons (Gavia immer) nesting on the Lake Superior shoreline of Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, were observed from mid-May to early August of 1992 and 1993 to develop a time-activity budget which could be compared with that of loons nesting on inland lakes elsewhere. Lake Superior loons spent significantly more time moving about their territories during the pre-nesting stage than at any other time during the breeding season and significantly more time resting during the post-nesting stage than at any other time (P< 0.05). We present evidence that the optimal rime budget for a loon in its given habitat may be relatively flexible and subject to environmental influence. Differences in loon behavior over time may reflect changing environmental conditions (e.g., changes in the prey base or water quality) and provide valuable information for conservation efforts.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1998	112	2					191	197																WOS:000075085600001

Water remained in the lake in 1989. Population size of the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta belli) decreased by approximately 70 percent following two years drought, with indications that both mortality and emigration contributed to this reduction.

J	Gajsek, U; Sieber, A; Finderle, Z				Gajsek, Urska; Sieber, Arne; Finderle, Zarko			Thermal balance of spinal cord injured divers during cold water diving: A case control study	DIVING AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE												Introduction: This study compared the thermal balance of spinal cord injured (SCI) divers and able-bodied (AB) divers during recreational cold-water dives. Methods: Ten divers (5 AB, 5 SCI) in matched pairs dived in a shallow lake (temperature 6 degrees C) for 30 to 36 min wearing 5 mm 'Long John' neoprene wetsuits. A gastrointestinal temperature radio pill recorded gastro-intestinal temperature (T-gi) prior to, immediately after and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 min post-dive. Subjective ratings of temperature perception were recorded concomitantly using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: No difference between SCI and AB divers in T-gi before the dive was observed (P = 0.85). After the dive, SCI divers cooled significantly more than AB at all measured time intervals (P < 0.001). Post dive, the mean maximum fall in T-gi during the recovery phase in SCI divers was 0.85 degrees C (SD 0.20) and in the AB group was 0.48 degrees C (0.48). In addition, there was greater individual variation in SCI divers compared to AB divers. There were no statistically significant differences in temperature perception between the groups either before or at any time after the dives. Conclusions: In contrast to AB divers, divers with SCI were unable to maintain T-gi during short shallow dives in 6 degrees C water and their temperatures fell further post-dive. The reduction in T-gi was not reflected in the subjective ratings of temperature perception by the SCI divers. The study was too small to assess how the level of spinal injury influenced thermal balance.																			1833-3516					SEP	2020	50	3					256	263		10.28920/dhm50.3.256-263	http://dx.doi.org/10.28920/dhm50.3.256-263								32957128					WOS:000610363800009
J	Hansen, L; Tassis, G; Hogaas, F				Hansen, Louise; Tassis, Georgios; Hogaas, Fredrik			Sand dunes and valley fills from Preboreal glacial-lake outburst floods in south-eastern Norway - beyond the aeolian paradigm	SEDIMENTOLOGY												A major glacial-lake outburst flood in the Glomma valley, south-eastern Norway, took place during the final decay of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. A combined morphological, geophysical and sedimentological study provides new insight into the variety of processes and deposits of the flood. The studied succession, some tens of metres in thickness, comprises the fill of a major flood basin that developed during hydraulic ponding. Large-scale sand dunes and bars accumulated downstream of locations with expanding flow. Most notable are 10 m high, concentric dune ridges that accumulated downstream of a topographical constriction hosting a high-velocity flow. Flow expansion at the outlet generated intense turbulence and scouring. The sand-loaded eddies helped feeding the semi-stationary dune ridges that grew vertically and downflow under high aggradation rates. Internal structures vary but reflect an overall shift in sedimentation from prevailing supercritical flow to overall subcritical flow conditions at high flood levels. Loading by water and sediment caused large-scale, synsedimentary deformation, increasing local accommodation space. Fast-falling flood levels caused stronger flow locally, while mud and fine sand settled in stagnant pools. The fall caused a significant drop in hydrostatic pressure. This triggered a release of excess pore pressure causing massive dewatering and fluidisation. Water-escape structures include numerous (sub)vertical pipes. The present study shows that outburst flood-generated, large-scale dunes can develop in well-sorted, fine sand and are thereby easily confused with aeolian deposits. Several dune fields in south-eastern Norway are here reinterpreted as the product of at least two major flood events. Sandy dune fields with similar characteristics elsewhere in Scandinavia should likely also be reinterpreted, and the role of outburst floods during the final deglaciation of Scandinavia has seemingly been underestimated. The study emphasises the importance of ponding, flow expansion, sorting, rapidly changing pressure conditions and deformation for outburst flood-related sedimentation.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2020	67	2					810	848		10.1111/sed.12663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12663		NOV 2019											WOS:000497084200001

The Importance of Habitat and Lake Morphometry for the Summer Diet Choice of Landlocked Arctic Char in Two West Greenland Lakes	WATER												Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is a top predator and the most widespread fish in Arctic lakes. The presence of Arctic char affects the predator-prey dynamics of the key species in the food webs in these lakes. This study sought to elucidate the effects of habitat (littoral, pelagic, or profundal) and lake morphometry on the trophic position of this char in the food web. Using stomach content and stable isotope analyses, we investigated the effect of fish length, habitat, and time (individual survey years: 2008, 2013, 2018, and 2019) on the dietary niches of landlocked Arctic char populations during summer in two west Greenland lakes: Badeso (area 0.8 km(2), mean depth 9.2 m) and Langeso (area 0.3 km(2), mean depth 5.0 m). The small char (<20 cm fork length) in Badeso generally foraged less littoral macroinvertebrates than those from Langeso. The large chars were mainly piscivorous in both lakes. In Badeso, there was a shift from relying on littoral to pelagic invertebrates by the small char from 2008-2013 to 2018-2019. The proportionally larger size of the littoral habitat in the smaller Langeso led to an increased reliance on littoral-derived macroinvertebrates in the diet of the small char, more so than in the larger Badeso, where the predominant reliance was on pelagic sources.

J	Salcher, MM				Salcher, Michaela M.			Same same but different: ecological niche partitioning of planktonic freshwater prokaryotes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lakes and ponds harbour a high number of diverse planktonic microorganisms that are centrally involved in biochemical cycles and aquatic food webs. Although the open water body (pelagial) seems to be a uniform and unstructured environment, ecological niche separation of coexisting microbial taxa might be triggered by limiting resources (bottom-up control) and mortality factors (top-down control), leading to distinct spatial and temporal distribution patterns of different microbes. This review gives an overview of the most abundant prokaryotic populations by grouping them in specific ecological guilds based on their life strategies. Defense specialists such as very small Actinobacteria or big filamentous bacteria mostly occur at times of highest grazing pressure by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, the main consumers of bacteria. Oligotrophic ultramicrobacteria, on the other hand, seem to be mostly adapted to nutrient depleted water layers during summer stratification, while opportunistic bacteria profit from material released during short-living algal blooms. Seasonal changes in abiotic and biotic factors may be the main causes for periodic reoccurring density maxima of different prokaryotes populations in the pelagial of temperate lakes, reflected in a distinct seasonality of the freshwater bacterioplankton.

Twentieth-century warming revives the world's northernmost lake	GEOLOGY												Although recent ecological changes are widespread in Arctic lakes, it remains unclear whether they are more strongly associated with climate warming or the deposition of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from anthropogenic sources. We developed a 3500-yr paleolimnological record from the world's northernmost lake to explore this question. Microfossils indicate that siliceous diatoms and chrysophytes were abundant initially, but disappeared 2400 yr ago in concert with Neoglacial cooling. Microfossils reappear in 20th-century sediments and reach unprecedented concentrations in sediments deposited after ca. A.D. 1980, tracking increasing summer temperatures in the absence of evidence for atmospheric nutrient subsidies. These results indicate that current warming in northern Greenland is unprecedented in the context of the past 2400 yr, and that climate change alone is responsible for the marked biological changes observed.					; Steig, Eric/G-9088-2015; Cooke, Colin/E-7842-2011; Steig, Eric/G-9088-2015; Kjaer, Kurt/A-4199-2013	Perren, Bianca/0000-0001-6089-6468; Steig, Eric/0000-0002-8191-5549; Cooke, Colin/0000-0002-7417-5263; Steig, Eric/0000-0002-8191-5549; Kjaer, Kurt/0000-0002-8871-5179													0091-7613	1943-2682				NOV	2012	40	11					1003	1006		10.1130/G33621.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G33621.1													WOS:000310411000011

On average, protists consumed similar to 90% of bacterial production in both layers. The community composition of HNF and the relative importance of different HNF groups as picoplankton consumers were determined. Small HNF (<8 mu m), as chrysomonads, bodonids and choanoflagellates, usually accounted for <30% of total HNF biomass but numerically dominated the community in both layers. They consumed most of (similar to 70 to 85 %) the bacterioplankton as well as autotrophic picoplankton (APP, exclusively cyanobacteria) production in the reservoir, with the rest consumed by ciliates. Both ciliates and HNF had higher clearance rates on APP than on bacteria and their grazing was likely responsible for a sharp decrease in APP abundance (from 3-4 x 10(5) to <2 x 10(3) ml(-1)) and a very constant size structure of bacterioplankton in which short rods in the size class of 0.4 to 0.8 mu m constituted 55 to 80 % of the total bacterial biomass in both layers. The proportion of HNF to total picoplankton biomass in the epilimnion indicated that the picoplankton biomass was sufficiently high to support HNF growth for most of the study. Uptake of picoplankton by less numerous, but larger, HNF (kathablepharids, Goniomonas sp., and Streptomonas sp.) was negligible, while their biomass, especially in the metalimnion, exceeded that of small HNF and the total biomass of picoplankton. This suggested that food items other than picoplankton were consumed to meet their carbon requirements. Analyzing potential bottom-up and top-down factors controlling HNF numbers and biomass, we did not find a tight relationship between HNF and the concentration of bacteria and chlorophyll. Variability of HNF abundance and biomass in the epilimnion could largely be explained by cladocerans or by pooled abundances of all potential crustacean consumers of HNF. In the metalimnion, the mean cell volume of HNF was positively linked to chlorophyll but negatively to the abundance of Cyclopidae and to the pooled abundances of Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and Diaphanosoma brachyurum.

In seeking ways to improve freshwater management, there are increasing calls to include tikanga (indigenous laws and values) into decision-making frameworks. Indigenous concepts such as kaitiakitanga (the responsibility to take care of natural resources) and Te Mana o te Wai (restoring and protecting the integrity of water) have gained traction. This article will explain these concepts through a distinctively indigenous lens and highlight some of the challenges of integrating tikanga into dominant western frameworks.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2019	35	10					1615	1621		10.1002/rra.3365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3365													WOS:000619599400002

Latest Diversity Trend and Seasonal Abundance of Population of Zooplankton (Holoplankton) Communities in the South Caspian Sea, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Seasonal variations of zooplankton communities were studied in the southern Caspian Sea for 4 successive seasons and 8 transects with 5 stations from 5 to 100 m depths which sampled during 2009. The zooplankton population constituted of 73.33% copepods, 24.21% rotifers, 2.23% cladocerans and 0.23% protozoans. Copepods were dominant at all stations with a density between 1456 +/- 531 ind. m(-3) (Transect 8) to 4524 +/- 1215 ind. m(-3) (transect 2). The predominant species of copepods was Acartia tonsa constituting 99.50% of all copepod populations. They were most abundant during warm months of summer in the upper layers (surface to 20 m depth) while rotifers replaced them during cold season. The maximum density of zooplankton was observed in the west decreasing towards the eastern parts of the sea.

For data processing, we applied a Semi-Global Matching algorithm deployed in LPS- ERDAS. Ground control points were also used for validation, which were obtained during the autumn of 2014. Then, precise estimate are derived for the glacier area, the terminus elevation, the areas of supraglacial debris and the areas of proglacial lakes. Further, the ASTER (obtained in 2011) and SRTM V3 (of 2000) elevation models were used in conjunction with the generated SPOT-7 DEM to estimate the glaciers mass balance between 2000, 2011 and 2014. Mass balance was observed negative for all five glaciers, but the mass loss decreased from the mean of -0.99 +/- 0.27 m.w.e.a(-1) in 2000-2011 to -0.61 +/- 0.31 m.w.e.a(-1) from 2011 to 2014.

Influence of summertime mesoscale convective systems on the heat balance and surface mixed layer dynamics of a large Amazonian hydroelectric reservoir	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We evaluated the impacts of summertime mesoscale convective systems (MCS) on the heat balance and diel surface mixed layer (SML) dynamics of the Brazilian Amazon's Tucurui Hydroelectric Reservoir (THR). We used a synergistic approach that combines in situ data, remote sensing data, and three-dimensional (3-D) modeling to investigate the typical behavior of the components of the heat balance and the SML dynamics. During the study period (the austral summer of 2012-2013), 22 days with MCS activity were identified. These events occurred approximately every 4 days, and they were most frequent during January (50% of the observations). An analysis of local meteorological data showed that when MCS occur, the environmental conditions at THR change significantly (p-value<0.01). The net longwave flux, which was the heat balance component most strongly impacted by MCS, increased more than 32% on days with MCS activity. The daily integrated heat balance became negative (-54 W m(-2)) on MCS days, while the balance was positive (19 W m(-2)) on non-MCS days. In response to the changes in the heat balance, the SML dynamics changed when a MCS was over the THR. The SML depth was typically 28% higher on the days with MCS (approximate to 1.6 m) compared with the days without MCS (approximate to 1.3 m). The results indicate that MCS are one of the main meteorological disturbances driving the heat balance and the mixing dynamics of Amazonian hydroelectric reservoirs during the summer. These events may have implications for the water quality and greenhouse gas emissions of Amazonian reservoirs.					; Araújo, Carlos/HSF-6830-2023; Alcantara, Enner/H-4286-2012; Ogashawara, Igor/Q-5013-2018; Curtarelli, Marcelo/H-4455-2019; Lorenzzetti, Joao A./HPH-2946-2023	Sampaio de Araujo, Carlos Alberto/0000-0003-0501-8667; Curtarelli, Marcelo/0000-0002-9316-8915; Alcantara, Enner/0000-0002-7777-2119; Ogashawara, Igor/0000-0001-6328-0001; Lorenzzetti, Joao A./0000-0003-3752-1021													2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC	2014	119	12					8472	8494		10.1002/2014JC010288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010288													WOS:000348452800016

Little is known about the impact of such diversions in sub -arctic and arctic lakes, which are characterized by weak summer stratification and a high relative contribution of cold and highly turbid tributaries of glacial origin. From 2003 to 2007, Lake Lagarflj <acute accent>ot (53 km 2 , 65 degrees N) experienced a series of changes in its natural hydrological conditions as part of the 690 MW K <acute accent>arahnj & uacute;kar hydroelectric project. The most significant change was the damming and diversion of a second glacial river into the lake, reducing its hydraulic residence time by a factor of three, and increasing its background turbidity levels by one order of magnitude. Here we developed a three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling approach to assess the impacts of this project on the Lake ' s physics. We accounted for the uncertainty in pre -dam suspended -solids data and conducted a stepwise assessment of each alteration in the hydrological forcing and lake background conditions. The results revealed abrupt changes in the lake ' s summer thermal dynamics. Advective heat fluxes now have a similar magnitude to atmospheric heat exchanges or even dominate the lake ' s heat balance during the second half of the thermal stratification period. The diversion of deep water from H <acute accent>alsl <acute accent>on reservoir led to a net cooling of both the surface (median approximate to 1 degrees C) and deep (median approximate to 0.6 degrees C) layers of the lake during the thermal stratification period, to a approximate to 45 % decrease in the average summer water column Schmidt stability and a two-week decrease in the duration of the thermal stratification period. The lower stability of the water column and deep river -plume intrusions now facilitate nearly complete hypolimnetic water renewal during the thermal stratification period. The proposed modeling approach, which deconstructs the lake ' s conditions from post- to pre -operational stages, is suitable for lakes with limited pre -operational in -situ data.

J	DRIVER, EA				DRIVER, EA			LIMNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF SOME SALINE LAKES IN WEST-CENTRAL MANITOBA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												During the summer of 1963 a qualitative and quantitative survey of the total dissolved solids of the six lakes, Crawford, Raven, Shoal, Horseshoe, and Eighteen in west-central Manitoba, was conducted to establish the chemical type. The lakes ranged in decreasing salinities respectively from approximately 10,300 ppm to approximately 4000 ppm. The predominant anion was sulphate and the predominant cation was magnesium in each lake. With considerations of information for certain physical and morphometric features a trophic status was derived. These lakes are eutrophic-saline-glacial lakes of the sulphate type.																									1965	22	5					1165	+		10.1139/f65-104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f65-104													WOS:A19656999900005
J	Mänttäri, I; Koivisto, M				Mänttäri, I; Koivisto, M			Ion microprobe uranium-lead dating of zircons from the Lappajarvi impact crater, western Finland	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The lake Lappajarvi impact crater lies in Paleoproterozoic Svecofennian metasedimentary rocks, on the western side of the Central Finland granitoid complex (similar to1.9 Ga). Two conflicting ages have been reported for the meteorite impact: an age of 77.3 +/- 0.4 Ma on the basis of Ar-Ar whole-rock data from impact melt samples and a paleomagnetic age of 195 Ma. During studies on impact crater indicator minerals at Lappajarvi, zircons with an atypical appearance were found in suevite boulders. These zircons seemed to have been affected by impact shock metamorphism and it was considered that they would be good candidates for ion microprobe U-Pb dating, allowing a new and independent age estimate for the impact event at Lappajarvi. Four spot analyses on two black-coated zircons plotted close to the upper intercept end of the concordia curve giving an approximate age of 1.8 Ga for the source rock. Seventeen analyses were done on three dull zircon grains showing patchy impact-related partial recrystallization. Most of these data fell fairly well on a single discordia line with intercept ages of 73.3 +/- 5.3 Ma and 1854 +/- 51 Ma. However, five of the data spots near the lower intercept end fell on the younger side of the line. This was interpreted to indicate post-impact loss of lead. Importantly, the new ion microprobe U-Pb age of 73.3 5.3 Ma is in a very good agreement with the previously reported Ar-Ar age.																			0026-1114					AUG	2001	36	8					1087	1095																WOS:000170599300009

Lake deposits of moderate salinity as sensitive indicators of lake level fluctuations: Example from the Upper Rotliegend saline lake (Middle-Late Permian, Northeast Germany)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Rotliegend saline lake periodically covered wide areas of the Southern Permian Basin in Northwest Europe during the Permian. The sedimentology, mineralogy and geochemistry of lake deposits were studied to document very high frequency lake level fluctuations and to evaluate their triggers. Increased precipitation and marine ingressions into the basin resulted in lake extension. Increased run-off is documented by intercalated fluvial deposits in low-salinity deposits of the lake. Because lake deposits reflect mainly deposition in relatively wet climate phases, they are not correlatable to halite deposits in other basin areas. Decreased precipitation is followed by shrinkage of the lake, desiccation at its margins, and higher lake salinity due to concentration of the brine. Carbonate and anhydrite contents of lake deposits increased considerably before the areas fell dry, but halite is not preserved in the study area. Falling lake level is also reflected by the occurrence of wave ripples, reflecting decreased water depth and finally by desiccation and formation of evaporite crusts. Not only the mineralogical content, but also the colour of lake claystones changes with varying salinity. Anhydrite- and carbonate-free red claystones were replaced by violet to green and grey anhydritic and calcareous claystone or marls with increasing salinity. The amount of boron adsorbed on illite also corresponds to changes in salinity and can therefore be used as a palaeosalinity indicator. Rare earth element concentrations within lake deposits do not reflect variations in salinity but different palaeogeographical settings. Marine ingressions into the lake are neither reflected by the amount of boron adsorbed onto illite nor by rare earth element contents of the lake deposits. Highly saline deposits are partly characterised by intensive deformation, which can be interpreted as seismites or dissolution breccias. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maximum flooding surfaces are best identified within profundal oil shale that caps some of the elastic parasequences. These lacustrine transgressive systems tracts therefore exhibit parasequence stacking patterns unlike typical marine sequences. Two types of sequence boundary are identified. Type A sequence boundaries display evidence for a basinward shift in facies across a regionally mappable surface that is an angular or, rarely, parallel unconformity, and they typically juxtapose amalgamated braided fluvial channel sandstone (late lowstand systems tract) onto the profundal oil shale. They also bound depositional sequences that show a distinct asymmetry, being dominated by transgressive systems tracts 5-80 m thick. Highstand systems tracts are less than 4 m thick and may be removed completely, by erosion on overlying sequence boundaries. Other surfaces satisfy only some of the standard criteria of sequence boundaries and are termed type B sequence boundaries. Type A sequence boundaries mark pronounced base-level falls following times when the Uinta Lake had merged with a lake in an adjacent basin to form a much deeper lake. Such merging permitted the establishment of a new threshold at higher elevation following lake-level balancing. Type B sequence boundaries are interpreted as marking base-level falls from a barely merged lake or a lake that had an outflow. Over a 200 m stratigraphic thickness, type A sequence boundaries are more common upsection, indicating that, with time, a pluvial climate became more pronounced or that the adjacent lake was more easily filled. Type A sequence boundaries also become angular rather than parallel unconformities upsection, suggesting increased tilting of the basin margin over time.					; Keighley, Dave/IYJ-5481-2023	Flint, Stephen/0000-0002-0558-6261; 													1527-1404	1938-3681				NOV	2003	73	6					987	1006		10.1306/050103730987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/050103730987													WOS:000186375400011

Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dominated eastern Himalayan vegetation is sensitive to even a minor change in climate parameters, hence suitable for studying climate-plant interactions. We reconstruct a similar to 2400 years climatic history of the Darjeeling area, eastern Himalaya combining pollen, phytoliths, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), delta C-13 signatures, sediment texture and total organic carbon (TOC) records from a lacustrine deposit to explore ecosystem response to climate change and to understand the possible forcing mechanisms behind it. This study is centred on two northern hemispheric late Holocene climatic events namely Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). Although considerable variations exist globally for these warm (moist) and cool (dry) periods with respect to their timing, duration, and hydroclimatic dynamics, our results identify a humid climatic phase at the beginning of the last millennium, a pre-MWP less humid phase, while MWP was wetter than the former phase and a wet LIA in the Darjeeling Himalaya. Our results indicate that this climatic variability also induced changes in the regional vegetation. During 364 BCE to 131 CE, the region was humid harbouring a dense broad-leaved evergreen forest; a comparatively drier condition prevailed between 131 CE and 624 might be the reason behind the thinning in the forest cover. A wet phase is observed during 1118 CE. A further increase in monsoonal strength is apparent between 1367 CE and 1802. Considering the available records from the eastern Himalaya and peninsular India it is inferred that centennial scale variations in frequencies of "active dominated" and "break-dominated" periods govern the internal dynamics of the ISM, and considered to be the key forcing mechanism behind the differential behaviour of the ISM over these regions.					; Biswas, Oindrila/OLP-5934-2025; Nautiyal, Chandra/F-7892-2012; Agrawal, Shailesh/O-6255-2015; SHARMA, ANUPAM/AAK-7338-2020	Bera, Subir/0000-0002-1075-7846; Biswas, Oindrila/0000-0001-9649-1593; sharma, Anupam/0000-0002-4152-763X; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2018	170						84	99		10.1016/j.catena.2018.05.043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.05.043													WOS:000441681500008

Desert-dust deposition began to increase similar to 4700 cal. BP. Rainfall during the summer-monsoon season declined permanently after 4100 cal. BP. A further significant change in atmospheric circulation, giving rise to multidecadal to centennial-scale droughts and enhanced dust deposition, occurred similar to 1500 cal. BP. Hence, the post-1968 Sahel drought is not unique. The prolonged arid episode that occurred around 1200-1000 cal.

Analyses were conducted at a regional level using four Finnish muskrat populations living 85-750 km apart, and at a local level using five subpopulations living 2-9 km apart in one Finnih lake. Only spring samples of animals born in the previous summer were used (n = 508), but sexes were pooled because they were not found to differ in variability. Reduced variability was found in traits connected with feeding. In larger variables the coefficient of variation (CV) was moderately negatively correlated with the mean, but in the smallest measurements the variability increased sharply. The dependence of the CV on the mean of the trait, thus, is hyperbolic. Corrected variabilities for each trait were calculated as the residuals from this function. Measurements error was estimated by repeated measurings of the same skulls, using two methods differing in accuracy. The proportion of measurement error in the CV varied from 3 to 23%, if measuring accuracy was 0.1 mm, and from 13 to 45% if accuracy was only 0.5 mm (mean of the variables ranged from 4 to 63mm). The proportion of measurement error in the CV increased with a decreasing mean value of the trait, but this cannot alone explain the great variability in the small traits. Environmental effects on variability were studied by grouping animals on the basis of their condition, classified by a growth index that measured body-weight gain per unit of molar wear. Improvement in animal condition decreased general amorphological variability. We concluded that habitat quality, especially poor diet, was the main stress factor increasing variation, and specimens with the poorest condition were particularly exposed to this effect. In order to examine and compare allometric relationships on both a local and regional scale, each variable was divided by condylobasal length of the skull (CL; calculated by substraction in log scale). If the corrected variability of a trait was lower or equal to that of CL, the transformation often induced a negative correlation with general size. In comparisons between local subpopulations, the effect of this bias was not serious: the allometic transformation reduced size differences that depend on habitat quality. If the correlation structure of the data was more heterogeneous, as in regional data, the transformation produced partly confusing results in univariate and principal component analyses, but discriminant function analysis was not seriously affected.																			0039-7989					MAR	1987	36	1					35	51		10.2307/2413306	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2413306													WOS:A1987H371100003
J	DONOHOE, RW				DONOHOE, RW			MUSKRAT REPRODUCTION IN AREAS OF CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED WATER-LEVEL UNITS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Basic aspects of muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) productivity in the Lake Erie marshes were investigated to determine if differences in reproduction could be detected between animals living in areas of controlled (managed) and uncontrolled (unmanaged) water-level habitats. From the regular trapping seasons of 1954-55 through 1957-58, and in the summer of 1955, 9,091 muskrats were examined. The results suggest that diked units will increase population densities through a reduction of mortality, but these enclosures apparently have little influence on reproductive physiology. Pregnant muskrats were captured from Feb. through Aug. Corpora lutea were present in ovaries from Jan. through Aug. Thus the breeding period would be long enough for one female to produce at least three litters if gestation is approximately 30 days. Further data suggest that during the latter part of the breeding cycle (April-Aug.) sexual activity is reduced.

This was recorded as an ignimbrite flare-up event from approximately 18.1-14.4 Ma. To gain in-depth perspectives on the eruption chronology, tephrostratigraphy, and petrogenesis at the onset of CPR silicic volcanism, we applied a multi-proxy approach to Lower Miocene rhyolitic ignimbrites and pyroclastic fall deposits from the northern CPR to the Dinaride Lake System. High-precision zircon U-Pb geochronology distinguished two Lower Miocene groups of volcaniclastic rocks at ti 18.1 Ma and ti 17.3 Ma. Based on combined tephrostratigraphic signatures we propose that the ti 18.1 Ma Kalnik and ti 17.3 Ma Eger eruptions produced widespread (intermediate to) large caldera-forming massive rhyolitic ignimbrites, deposited across northern and southwestern regions of the CPR. Due to easterly winds that carried volcanic ash hundreds of kilometers to the southwest, Eger eruption products also reached distal intra-montane Dinaride lacustrine basins, recorded as pyroclastic fall deposits. Heterogeneous major and trace elemental compositions of ti 18.1 Ma volcanic glass shards suggest that the Kalnik eruption was sourced from complex silicic magmatic systems, with simultaneous tapping of two discrete melt bodies during the eruption. The homogeneous geochemical composition of ti 17.3 M a glasses is distinct from the older glasses. Integrated zircon and bulk glass Nd-Hf isotope compositions have a positive correlation, defining a regional mantle array, and are more radiogenic in the younger phase of volcanism. The recorded systematic isotopic change, moving from older more crustal signatures to younger more juvenile compositions, imply that during the period of lithospheric thinning of the Pannonian Basin the region underwent more complex variations in the interaction between metasoma-tized lithospheric mantle-derived magmas and various crustal components than previously recognized.

Extensive feeding on sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka smolts by bull trout Salvelinus confluentus during initial outmigration into a small, unregulated and inland British Columbia river	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Stomach contents were collected and analysed from 22 bull trout Salvelinus confluentus at the edge of the Chilko Lake and Chilko River in British Columbia, Canada, during spring outmigration of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka smolts. Twenty of the 22 (>90%) stomachs contained prey items, virtually all identifiable prey items were outmigrant O. nerka smolts and stomach contents represented a large portion (00-126%) of estimated S. confluentus mass. The results demonstrate nearly exclusive and intense feeding by S. confluentus on outmigrant smolts, and support recent telemetry observations of high disappearance rates of O. nerka smolts leaving large natural lake systems prior to entering high-order unregulated river systems.

In order to explore the spatiotemporal variation of the SS in Le'an river catchment, an important sub-catchment of Poyang lake basin, a total of 17 sampling points at rivers were selected for observations. Results show that, the concentration of SS is quite different across the catchment. The average concentration of SS in the upstream of the catchment with forest as the dominant land use, is 6.92mg/L, while the concentration in the downstream with a certain percentage of arable land is 14.39mg/L. The SS concentration shows an increasing trend from the upstream to the downstream, in correlation with the change of land uses. Also there exists a considerable deviation of the SS concentration in different seasons. The concentration in summer is relatively high, while lower in other seasons, with a likely relationship to rainfall events.

Paradoxically, the climate change mitigation strategy of fossil fuel divestment is in itself subject to shifts in weather patterns resulting from climate change. This is particularly true with solar power, which depends on local cloud cover. However, because observed shortwave radiation data usually span a decade or less, persistent long-term trends may not be identified. A simple linear regression model is created here using diurnal temperature range (DTR) during 2002-15 as a predictor variable to estimate long-term shortwave radiation (SR) values in the northeastern United States. Using an extended DTR dataset, SR values are computed for 1956-2015. Statistically significant decreases in shortwave radiation are identified that are dominated by changes during the summer months. Because this coincides with the season of greatest insolation and the highest potential for energy production, financial implications may be large for the solar energy industry if such trends persist into the future.

Rock avalanching into a landslide-dammed lake causing multiple dam failure in Las Conchas valley (NW Argentina) - evidence from surface exposure dating and stratigraphic analyses	LANDSLIDES												Generally landslide dams which exist for several hundreds to thousands of years are considered as stable. We show with an example from the Argentine Andes that such dams can exist for several thousands of years but still may fail catastrophically. Multiple rock avalanches impounded two lakes with surface areas of similar to 8 km(2) and similar to 600 km(2), respectively, in Las Conchas valley, NW Argentina. Surface exposure dating (SED) by Be-10 of the rock-avalanche deposits or landslide scars indicates that these landslides occurred at 15,300 +/- 2,000 yr and 13,550 +/- 900 yr. The dams were stable during a strong earthquake, as suggested by seismites within related lake sediments and by multiple coeval landslides in this region, which occurred at similar to 7.5 kyr. However, when a further rock-avalanche fell into the lower, smaller lake at 4,800 +/- 500 yr the dam downriver was destroyed, presumably by the resulting tsunami wave. The resulting flood also destroyed an additional rock-fall dam which had formed at similar to 5,630 yr C-14 cal BP 30 km downriver. The new dam formed by the second rock avalanche was eroded prior to 3,630 yr C-14 cal BP. This dam erosion coincides with an important climatic shift towards more humid conditions in the Central Andes. Our results show that instead of direct effects of strong seismicity on landslide dams, (1) landsliding into a landslide-dammed lake, (2) abrupt hydrological changes, and (3) climate change towards conditions related to enhanced run-off are processes which can produce failures of "quasi-stable" natural dams.					; Hermanns, Reginald/J-1418-2019	Niedermann, Samuel/0000-0003-1626-5284; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				JUL	2004	1	2					113	122		10.1007/s10346-004-0013-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-004-0013-5													WOS:000207214800003

Mean daily lake evaporation (+/- variability between methods) was estimated to be 3.2(-0.3)(+0.3) mm d(-1) and 2.5(-0.3)(+0.6) mmd(-1) over fifty-day periods during two consecutive summers. Based on these results and additional class-A pan data, total thaw-season evaporation estimates of 220 mm to 320 mm were obtained, equivalent to 70% to 100% of annual precipitation. These values are 15 to 70% higher than predicted by standard evaporation maps of Canada. Our results indicate that the Priestley-Taylor model provides a good approximation of the Bowen ratio energy balance model in this setting. As expected, estimates based on mass balance are highly sensitive to uncertainty in measurement of lake inflow and outflow.

We carefully explored the diversity and influencing factors of culturable fungi across Dianchi Lake, Fuxian Lake, Xingyun Lake, and Yangzonghai Lake in Yunnan Province, China. Through fungi culture, morphological characterization, and ITS sequence analysis, we identified a total of 565 isolates belonging to 405 species across 133 genera. The diversity indices viz. H ', D, and J were evaluated for fungal diversity across the lakes. Interestingly, although diversity indices were highest during summer and at Yangzonghai Lake, no significant differences in fungal community diversity were observed between seasons and regions. Water variables were analyzed and indicated that changes with rapid fluctuations in temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen likely influence fungal diversity. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of fungal communities within plateau lake ecosystems, thereby aiding in managing and conserving vital aquatic resources.

In this work, we have investigated the seasonal occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the surface water samples of Lake Manipal in southwest India. The concentration of MPs was found to be higher during the monsoon season (0.423 particles/L) in comparison with the post-monsoon (0.117 particles/L) period. The higher abundance is attributed to the input of storm-water sewers connected to the lake as well as surface runoff during periods of high rainfall. The concentrations of small-sized (0.3-1 mm) microplastics were greater in both seasons. Approximately 96% of the microplastics were fibres, followed by smaller amounts of fragments, pellets, films, and foams. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the principal polymer composition of the microplastics, followed by cellulose. The PET and cellulose fibres were mainly derived from the laundering of clothes in the residential colonies and hostels situated close to the lake. The storm-water sewers were the likely conduit for these PET fibres into the lake. The Pollution Load Index (PLI) data reveals that pollution due to microplastics in Lake Manipal falls within the Level I risk category. The PLI was higher during the monsoon season due to an increased flux of these particles from the nearby region. During the post-monsoon period, the PLI values decreased, suggesting that MPs in the water column may have settled and mixed with the sediments. The baseline data generated in this study is important as different types of birds, amphibians, and other microorganisms are present in the environment of Lake Manipal. We also propose certain policy measures that can be adopted by the regional population to mitigate microplastic pollution in the lake and its vicinity.

The South Tibet Detachment System (STDS) is a major litho-tectonic boundary that divides the Dhauli Ganga valley into two broad geomorphic entities. Towards the north of STDS, the valley is wide and "U" shaped, and the rivers have a braid-meandering channel, implying that the valley was carved by glacial sculpturing in the past. Whereas in the south, deep gorges indicate the dominance of fluvial processes. Based on the stratigraphic position and optical chro-nologies, the lithified moraines were assigned to Marine Isotopic Stage-3 (MIS-3) they were followed by a major deglaciation event represented by moderately lithified outwash gravels. Following this, a second glacier advance of lesser magnitude is dated 21.3 +/- 2.2 ka, corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A gradual recession of the LGM moraines led to the formation of a proglacial lake which probably persisted until around the onset of a pulsating deglaciation stage represented by outwash gravels dated between 13.4 +/- 1.6 and 9.4 +/- 0.8 ka. This was also the period when the valleys were overwhelmed by a high sediment water ratio, as indicated by temporary impoundments dated between 15.0 +/- 1 ka and 10.0 +/- 1 ka. Alluvial fan and debris flow sedimen-tation overwhelm the valley after around 9 ka and continues till the present.Climatically, the older lithified moraines indicate that glaciers advanced during the cooler MIS-4 or MIS-3. The first major deglaciation event seems to represent the pluvial phase of MIS-3. The presence of LGM moraines indicate that the valley responded to the global cooling and associated enhanced westerlies. In contrast, the chronology of outwash gravels suggests that the valley witnessed insolation driven by the early Holocene strengthened Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The undated youngest alluvial fans/debris flows are assigned the mid to late Holocene age (<9.5 ka) and seem to have deposited during the declining phase of ISM (low solar insolation). The study suggests that the landform evolution responded to both the global and regional climate variability indicating the sensitivity of the paraglacial valleys in the monsoon-dominated region to the late Quaternary climate variability.

The goal of this Study was to monitor the presence of these Substances in RO feed water and its removal by pre-treatment with MF/UF. Modifications were applied on the existing TEP determination method to measure both particulate (>0.4 mu m) and colloidal (0.05-0.40 mu m) TEP. Results show colloidal TEPs (c-TEP) were more abundant than particulate TEP (p-TEP) in both fresh and sea water samples, affirming the importance of measuring this often neglected colloidal fraction. Higher TEP concentrations were recorded in seawater than in freshwater samples and a significant variation of TEP concentration was observed in seawater samples collected during the spring season. In two integrated membrane systems (IMS), 70-75% of TEP removal was recorded by MF and UF with in-line coagulation. However, significant amounts of TEP (mostly c-TEP) remained after MF/UF pretreatments, and this may potentially cause organic and/or biological fouling in the RO system downstream.

J	Wu, JS; Shih, PY				Wu, JS; Shih, PY			Moving-load-induced vibrations of a moored floating bridge	COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES												The natural frequencies and mode shapes, and the coupled rigid-body (rolling) motion and elastic (flexural and torsional) vibration of a partial-catenary-moored floating bridge (in still water) subjected to a moving load are investigated. The mathematical model is obtained by simplifying one of the floating bridges in Lake Washington at Seattle, U.S.A. To derive the element mass matrix and stiffness matrix, the bridge is considered to be an elastic body supported by a number of uniformly distributed springs (to simulate the water buoyancy) and concentrated springs (to simulate the partial-catenary mooring cables). In addition to the vertical restoring forces, the axial preforces induced by the horizontal cables located at the two ends of the bridge, and the righting moments induced by the rolling motion and/or torsional vibration of the bridge are also taken into account. To agree with the practical situations, both the rigidly connected (or r-c) bridge (with all joints rigid) and the hinge-connected (or h-c) bridge (with part of the joints to be hinged) are all studied. To tackle the problem arising from the replacement of some of the rigid nodes of a rigidly connected bridge by the hinged ones, a method for deriving the property matrices and external equivalent nodal force vector of the "rigid-hinged" (or r-h) beam element is presented. The differences between free and forced dynamic behaviors for the hinge-connected (h-c) bridge and rigidly connected (r-c) bridge are discussed.

In this study, we establish a 3500-a-long paleoclimatic sequence based on high-resolution analyses of sedimentological and geochemical data of a well-dated sediment core from Yileimu Lake in southern Altay. High percentages of the >63-mu m fraction and high values of Zr/Rb and Rb/Sr ratios indicate strong transport of weakly weathered, coarse sediments into the depocenter of the lake caused by enhanced surface runoff and catchment erosion associated with a wet climate, and vice versa. High values of Ca and total inorganic carbon (TIC) contents imply increased precipitation of endogenic carbonates in the lake water under intense evaporation associated with a dry climate, and vice versa. This new record indicates two wet intervals at 3500-2300 and 600-100 cal a BP, interrupted by a severe and prolonged dry interval from 2300 to 1000 cal a BP, and a mild dry interval with occasionally wet conditions from 1000 to 600 cal a BP. These results are broadly consistent with other paleoclimatic records in Westerlies-dominated Asia and are generally anti-phase with those in the EASM region. We suggest that a strengthening/weakening and southward/northward migration of the Westerlies during a negative/ positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) transported more/less water vapor into arid Asia. Meanwhile, a decreasing/increasing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) superimposed on a southward/northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) triggered a weakening/strengthening and southward/northward movement of the West-Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), resulting in decreasing/increasing EASM intensity. In addition, the wet climate from 3500 to 2300 cal a BP may have contributed to the development of nomadic herding in the eastern Eurasian Steppe and Altay region, and to the opening of the proto-Silk Roads. Potentially, intense seismic activities in the Altay Mountains similar to 3500 cal a BP may have also promoted the opening of the proto-Silk Roads by forcing the herdsmen to move to the inter-mountainous basins.

Integration of remote-sensing data with WRF to improve lake-effect precipitation simulations over the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In this study, remotely sensed lake surface temperature (LST) and lake ice cover (LIC) were integrated into the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.2 to evaluate the simulation of lake-effect precipitation over the Great Lakes region. The LST was derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), while the LIC was obtained from the National Ice Center (NIC). WRF simulations for the Great Lakes region were performed at 10 km grid spacing for the cold season from November 2003 through February 2008. Initial and lateral boundary conditions were provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Experiments were carried out to compare winter precipitation simulations with and without the integration of the satellite data. Results show that integration with MODIS LST and NIC LIC significantly improves simulation of lake-effect precipitation over the Great Lakes region by reduced latent heat and sensible heat fluxes. A composite analysis of lake-effect precipitation events further reveals that more accurately depicted low-level stability and vertical moisture transport forced by the observation-based LST and LIC contribute to the improved simulation of lake-effect precipitation.

J	HOLOPAINEN, IJ				HOLOPAINEN, IJ			THE EFFECTS OF LOW PH ON PLANKTONIC COMMUNITIES - CASE-HISTORY OF A SMALL FOREST POND IN EASTERN FINLAND	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The pH of a small (0.13 ha), natural forest pond in eastern Finland decreased from > 6.0 to 4.0 during a dry summer. The cause of the acidification is unknown, but may have been localized groundwater acidification due to oxidation of sulfide compounds in the soil. The species composition and biomass of the phyto- and zooplankton during this period are reported and compared to those of a larger, connected pond, located ca. 20 m away, which retained its normal pH (> 6.0). The acidic pond had lower values for the species richness of phytoplankton, the mean chlorophyll a content (7.0 vs 10.4-mu-g/l) and the mean phytoplankton biomass (372 vs 928 mg/m3). The lower biomass was probably partly due to the lower nutrient content of the acidic pond. In the larger pond, green algae predominated in the phytoplankton (e.g., Koliella spiculiformis), whereas the acidic pond supported a virtual monoculture of Peridinium inconspicuum (Dinophyceae) in July-August, and Dinobryon sertularia (Chrysophyceae) in September. The mean biomass of the zooplankton was also lower in the acidic pond (23.4 vs 53.0 mg/m3), which was mainly due to the small numbers of Crustacea in late summer, when the pH values were lowest. The low zooplankton biomass was probably caused directly by the low pH or indirectly by a shortage of food.																			0003-455X						1991	28	2					95	103																WOS:A1991HC18600004

Long-term change and geospatial patterns of river ice cover and navigability in Southcentral Alaska detected with remote sensing	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												People who travel on ice-covered rivers to access traditional lands and resources can be profoundly impacted by effects of climate change on river ice seasonality. We used remote sensing, bolstered by citizen science, to assess trends and geospatial patterns of the ice cover in the Copper River Basin of Southcentral Alaska. Our analysis of Landsat imagery from water years (WYs) 1973 to 2021 suggests a severely diminishing season of river ice travel (delayed or incomplete freezeup, early breakup) due to increasing air temperatures. The weekly probability of an adequate ice cover for river crossings declined by an average of 53 percentage points. Ice extent was closely related to accumulated freezing degree days (AFDD). AFDD(Oct-Apr) decreased by 15% since WY 1943, a significant warming trend. We mapped the spatiotemporal variation of ice and open water extent with multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1). We identified reaches with more reliable opportunities for winter access and others susceptible to extensive open water, differences related to flow energy and channel form. The results of this study can support local decision making and adaptation in response to rapidly changing river ice conditions, and our approach can be applied elsewhere to document change and improve travel safety.					; Brinkman, Todd/B-3578-2013	Miller, Mark/0000-0002-4691-7469; Brown, Dana/0000-0002-1195-7161; Spellman, Katie/0000-0002-2291-0190; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Engram, Melanie/0000-0002-1144-1827													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2023	55	1							2241279	10.1080/15230430.2023.2241279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2023.2241279													WOS:001054315100001

Using DNA metabarcoding datasets from a three-year-sampling (73 samples), we constructed the protistan plankton co-occurrence network of Lake Zurich, a model lake ecosystem subjected to climate change. Despite several documentations of dramatic lake warming in Lake Zurich, our study provides an unprecedented perspective by linking changes in biotic association patterns to climate stress. Water temperature belonged to the strongest environmental parameters splitting the data into two distinct seasonal networks (October-April; May-September). The expected ecological niche of phytoplankton, weakened through nutrient depletion because of permanent thermal stratification and through parasitic fungi, was occupied by the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens and mixotrophic nanoflagellates. Instead of phytoplankton, bacteria and nanoflagellates were the main prey organisms associated with key predators (ciliates), which contrasts traditional views of biological associations in lake plankton. In a species extinction scenario, the warm season network emerged as more vulnerable than the cold season network, indicating a time-lagged effect of warmer winter temperatures on the communities. We conclude that climate stressors compromise lake ecosystem robustness and resilience through species replacement, richness differences, and succession as indicated by key network properties.					; Kammerlander, Barbara/GWZ-2136-2022; Qu, Zhishuai/Y-5378-2018	Sonntag, Bettina/0000-0001-7065-522X; Qu, Zhishuai/0000-0002-2971-0570; BRUNI, Estelle P./0000-0002-0800-0254; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761														2076-2607				MAR	2021	9	3							549	10.3390/microorganisms9030549	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030549								33800927					WOS:000633902400001
J	Stuut, JB; Smalley, I; O'Hara-Dhand, K				Stuut, Jan-Berend; Smalley, Ian; O'Hara-Dhand, Ken			Aeolian dust in Europe: African sources and European deposits	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Danube Loess Symposium	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2006	INQUA, Loess Subcommiss, Novi Sad, SERBIA	Univ Novi Sad	INQUA, Loess Subcommiss			A conceptual model is presented for the provenance and dispersal patterns of small dust that falls on Europe. Generally its sources are in North Africa, and it is distributed across all Europe. Several key sources can be distinguished: 'Sahelian' dust comes largely from the old Lake Chad region-this is a clay-rich unimodal material. 'Saharan' dust comes from the great sand sheets-it contains small monomineralic particles and may have a bimodal size range. Three simple deposition zones can be recognised; a D1a zone where sufficient dust is deposited to form a discrete soil layer (not well classified as a Rendoll), in the extreme south of Europe; a D1b zone where the airborne dust simply provided a silty admixture to soil systems-across Middle Europe; and a northern zone D1c where the dust is a fugitive cloud, but very occasionally forms noticeable deposits. Two particle formation methods can be noted. Particle control in Sahelian dust is via the sedimentation in the original lake. This gives an open structure which can be modelled using a simple Monte Carlo approach. The open structure ensures that only small particles are produced; size control is via particle packing. A chipping mechanism can produce fine quartz particles from sandy deserts. The aeolian energy is, by and large, not sufficient to cause major impact fracturing but small mineral chips can be produced in the small dust size (fine and very fine silt), which go into high-level suspension and travel to Europe and beyond. The Saharan material can have a wider, more variable size distribution than the Sahelian material. The Canary Islands 'loess' is largely Sahelian material; the Cape Verde Islands deposits, from the nearby sandy regions, are Saharan deposits. Large dust has fallen on Europe, and produced widespread loess deposits. Large dust is essentially an 'in-continent' deposit; small dust comes from outside-from Africa.

Dissolved organic matter regulates nutrient limitation and growth of benthic algae in northern lakes through interacting effects on nutrient and light availability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Widespread increases in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration across northern lakes can alter rates of primary production by increasing nutrient availability and decreasing light availability. These dual effects of DOM generate a unimodal relationship in pelagic primary production and primary producer biomass among lakes over a gradient of DOM concentration. However, the responses of benthic algae to variation in DOM loading are less clear because of their potential to access sediment nutrients. We tested algal production and nutrient limitation along a DOM gradient in northern Sweden. Without added nutrients, benthic algal production showed a unimodal relationship with DOM, similar to reported pelagic responses. Nutrient addition revealed widespread nitrogen limitation, with decreasing severity in lakes with higher DOM. Because the majority of northern Swedish lakes currently fall below the inflection point in this unimodal relationship, moderate increases in DOM have the potential to increase benthic primary production, particularly for epilithic algae.					; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020; Fork, Megan/AAG-8474-2019	Fork, Megan/0000-0002-7789-3316; Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; 														2378-2242				DEC	2020	5	6					417	424		10.1002/lol2.10166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10166		AUG 2020											WOS:000566157100001
J	Prentice, IC; Jolly, D				Prentice, IC; Jolly, D		BIOME 6000 participants	Mid-Holocene and glacial-maximum vegetation geography of the northern continents and Africa	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												BIOME 6000 is an international project to map vegetation globally at mid-Holocene (6000 C-14 yr sp) and last glacial maximum (LGM, 18,000 C-14 yr sp), with a view to evaluating coupled climate-biosphere model results. Primary palaeoecological data are assigned to biomes using an explicit algorithm based on plant functional types. This paper introduces the second Special Feature on BIOME 6000. Site-based global biome maps are shown with data from North America, Eurasia (except South and Southeast Asia) and Africa at both time periods. A map based on surface samples shows the method's skill in reconstructing present-day biomes. Cold and dry conditions at LGM favoured extensive tundra and steppe. These biomes intergraded in northern Eurasia. Northern hemisphere forest biomes were displaced southward. Boreal evergreen forests (taiga) and temperate deciduous forests were fragmented, while European and East Asian steppes were greatly extended. Tropical moist forests (i.e. tropical rain forest and tropical seasonal forest) in Africa were reduced. In south-western North America, desert and steppe were replaced by open conifer woodland, opposite to the general arid trend but consistent with modelled southward displacement of the jet stream. The Arctic forest limit was shifted slighly north at 6000 C-14 yr sr in some sectors, but not in all. Northern temperate forest zones were generally shifted greater distances north. Warmer winters as well as summers in several regions are required to explain these shifts. Temperate deciduous forests in Europe were greatly extended, into the Mediterranean region as well as to the north. Steppe encroached on forest biomes in interior North America, but not in central Asia. Enhanced monsoons extended forest biomes in China inland and Sahelian vegetation into the Sahara while the African tropical rain forest was also reduced, consistent with a modelled northward shift of the ITCZ and a more seasonal climate in the equatorial zone. Palaeobiome maps show the outcome of separate, independent migrations of plant taxa in response to climate change. The average composition of biomes at LGM was often markedly different from today. Refugia for the temperate deciduous and tropical rain forest biomes may have existed offshore at LGM, but their characteristic taxa also persisted as components of other biomes. Examples include temperate deciduous trees that survived in cool mixed forest in eastern Europe, and tropical evergreen trees that survived in tropical seasonal forest in Africa. The sequence of biome shifts during a glacial-interglacial cycle may help account for some disjunct distributions of plant taxa. For example, the now-arid Saharan mountains may have linked Mediterranean and African tropical montane floras during enhanced monsoon regimes. Major changes in physical land-surface conditions, shown by the palaeobiome data, have implications for the global climate. The data can be used directly to evaluate the output of coupled atmosphere-biosphere models. The data could also be objectively generalized to yield realistic gridded land-surface maps, for use in sensitivity experiments with atmospheric models. Recent analyses of vegetation-climate feedbacks have focused on the hypothesized positive feedback effects of climate-induced vegetation changes in the Sahara/Sahel region and the Arctic during the mid-Holocene. However, a far wider spectrum of interactions potentially exists and could be investigated, using these data, both for 6000 C-14 yr BP and for the LGM.					; Sevastyanov, Dmitrii/G-3100-2015; Andreev, Andrei/J-2701-2015; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Panova, Nata/M-8304-2018	LEZINE, Anne-Marie/0000-0002-3555-5124; Ren, Guoyu/0000-0002-9351-4179; Bezusko, Lyudmila/0000-0001-6682-6129; Sevastyanov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-5141-3679; Andreev, Andrei/0000-0002-8745-9636; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; Bigelow, Nancy/0000-0001-5020-5002; Nadezhda, Dorofeyuk/0000-0001-6953-8384; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Panova, Nata/0000-0003-1449-5182; Perez-Obiol, Ramon/0000-0003-4145-6496; Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Farrera, Isabelle/0000-0002-1210-5032; Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636													0305-0270					MAY	2000	27	3					507	519		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00425.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00425.x													WOS:000166179900001

Over a two-year sampling period, different temporal patterns were observed. In the oligotrophic lake, nematode diversity showed moderate fluctuations and peaked in early summer. Diversity in meso- and eutrophic lakes showed the opposite pattern. Species composition changed along seasons, enabling to identify typical early and late season assemblages. This succession was linked to different reproduction periods of dominant species. The age structure and sex ratio of periphytic nematode communities varied both temporally and between lakes according to species traits. As an example, the male/female ratio increased with increasing lake trophic state. This trend reflects the decrease of partenogenetically reproducing species with increasing lake trophic state, and may be further considered as an indicator of lake trophic state.

Here we report a relative evolutionary rates (rERs) analysis of microbial communities from six diverse natural environments based on 40 metagenomic samples. We show that the rERs of microbial communities are mainly shaped by environmental conditions, and the microbes inhabiting extreme habitats (acid mine drainage, saline lake and hot spring) evolve faster than those populating benign environments (surface ocean, fresh water and soil). These findings were supported by the observation of more relaxed purifying selection and potentially frequent horizontal gene transfers in communities from extreme habitats. The mechanism of high rERs was proposed as high mutation rates imposed by stressful conditions during the evolutionary processes. This study brings us one stage closer to an understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the adaptation of microbes to extreme environments.

Evolution of Supraglacial Lakes on the Larsen B Ice Shelf in the Decades Before it Collapsed	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Larsen B ice shelf collapsed in 2002 losing an area twice the size of Greater London to the sea (3,000 km(2)), in an event associated with widespread supraglacial lake drainage. Here we use optical and radar satellite imagery to investigate the evolution of the ice shelf's lakes in the decades preceding collapse. We find (1) that lakes spread southward in the preceding decades at a rate commensurate with meltwater saturation of the shelf surface; (2) no trend in lake size, suggesting an active supraglacial drainage network which evacuated excess water off the shelf; and (3) lakes mostly refreeze in winter but the few lakes that do drain are associated with ice breakup 2-4 years later. Given the relative scale of lake drainage and shelf breakup, however, it is not clear from our data whether lake drainage is more likely a cause, or an effect, of ice shelf collapse.

Consecutive epidemics of Zygorhizidium planktonicum Canter coincided with winter overturn from December to March (1993-1995). Host abundances during this period ranged from 50-100 cells ml(-1) in December (11-13 degrees C) to > 200 cells ml(-1) from January to February (7-11 degrees C). The incidence of fungal infection remained below 15% at the onset of each bloom; however, infectivity increased to 32% and 44% by January 1994 and March 1995, respectively. Host populations declined considerably following re-stratification in March, and Z. planktonicum remained absent from surface waters until the subsequent winter bloom. Laboratory studies revealed that fungal resting spores could remain dormant for at least 250 d. Activation at 10-16 degrees C resulted in 70-80% germinability after only 6 d. On the basis of these findings, we propose that resting spores formed by the preceding epidemic remained dormant at reduced hypolimnion temperatures (< 10 degrees C). During win ter mixis, resting spores were resuspended with the incipient host population; thus germination at 10-13 degrees C coincided with the developing host bloom. These findings indicate that chytrid periodicity is largely determined by resting spore development and the effects of annual temperature patterns. Synchronized development an the basis of shared limnological constraints further suggest that host and parasite life histories have coevolved.																			0932-4739					DEC 31	1996	32	4					490	497																WOS:A1996WG56100007

Depth is a very important parameter to consider when sampling bacterial communities, as their abundance and composition can change within the distinct water layers. Stratified lakes are good model systems to study these connections since changes in environmental parameters can occur on a cm-scale at the thermo- and/or chemocline. Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle was sampled at discrete fine-scale depths at three time points covering a stage in which the lake was stratified and the beginning of winter mixing. In this paper we present the most abundant bacterial groups at the different depths sampled and also the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

The surface roughness was measured with a photogrammetry-based method where a black plate was inserted into the snow and photographed. After field work a 2D profile was automatically extracted from the image. The profiles extracted from the photographs were analyzed using root mean square height and correlation length as function of measured length. 777 profiles were measured during the SORTEX -campaign in different locations with different canopy type, including marshland, pine, birch and mixed forest and lake ice. In addition to this some profiles were measured in February 2010. The results show a clear shift from midwinter to melting season conditions as well as the effect of fresh snow on the surface.

Detoured flight direction responses along the southwest coast of Lake Erie by night-migrating birds	AUK												Migratory birds encounter the Great Lakes while moving through eastern North America toward breeding grounds to the North, which offers a good opportunity to study variation in migratory behavior as birds face a potentially influencing topographical feature. Using passive infrared technology, we documented the direction of relatively low-flying, nocturnal, mostly passerine migration in spring along the southern coast of Lake Erie's western basin. We examined the extent to which spring migrants flew across Lake Erie as a continuation of the inland, northeasterly broad front migratory direction, as determined by weather radar and infrared observations, or displayed a tendency to deviate to more closely follow the direction of the coastline. We found that an estimated 62% of all low-flying migrants deviated their flight directions toward the coast of Lake Erie at 2 coastal sites, Cedar Point and Ottawa, which were characterized by northwest-southeast oriented coastlines. Migrants at a third coastal location, Maumee Bay, which has a more east-west oriented coastline, did not display similarly deviated flight directions. We found that even when winds were energetically favorable for a lake crossing, many migrants still routinely displayed deviated flight directions that approached paralleling the coastline. Further, the mean flight direction at one site, Ottawa, shifted more in the direction of the coastline as the night progressed, suggesting that time of night could influence the shift to a more coastal flight direction. The data indicate that the western basin of Lake Erie acts as a salient topographical feature influencing the flight directions of nocturnal migrants. The data further suggest that birds are making active decisions while in flight, based on current environmental and physiological conditions, about whether to continue to cross Lake Erie or take a coastal detour.																				1938-4254				JUL	2019	136	3							ukz018	10.1093/auk/ukz018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/ukz018													WOS:000493040800002

The two most abundant species were congeneric, with very similar life cycles Plagiorchis muris and P. proximus. These 2 species never occurred together in large numbers at the same time, but showed both temporal succession and spatial isolation. The general level of parasitism was found to increase with increased size of adult snails, but juvenile snails were never found infected during the summer months.																									1967	45	6P2					1247	+		10.1139/z67-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z67-134													WOS:A1967A289000012

A total of 93 males and 35 females were collected in autumn (October 2014). The analyzes of heavy metals were conducted by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy with a PU9100X spectrometer. The content of mercury was determined using AMA 254 mercury analyser. As analyses indicated heavy metals accumulated in the muscle and exoskeleton in the following sequence: Zn > Cu > Pb > Mn > Ni > Hg and Mn > Pb > Zn > Ni > Cu > Hg, respectively. Statistically significant differences between 3- and 4-year-old males were found for all analyzed metals. Gender dependent differences were calculated only for Ni in the muscle tissue and for Mn and Hg in the exoskeleton. In comparison with the study carried out 2 years ago notably higher concentrations of Pb were found in the muscle and a higher content of Zn, Pb, Mn and Ni was determined in the exoskeleton.

McCall Glacier record of Arctic climate change: Interpreting a northern Alaska ice core with regional water isotopes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We explored modern precipitation and ice core isotope ratios to better understand both modern and paleo climate in the Arctic. Paleoclimate reconstructions require an understanding of how modern synoptic climate influences proxies used in those reconstructions, such as water isotopes. Therefore we measured periodic precipitation samples at Toolik Lake Field Station (Toolik) in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range in the Alaskan Arctic to determine 8180 and delta H-2. We applied this multi-decadal local precipitation delta O-18/temperature regression to similar to 65 years of McCall Glacier (also in the Brooks Range) ice core isotope measurements and found an increase in reconstructed temperatures over the late-20th and early-21st centuries. We also show that the McCall Glacier 8180 isotope record is negatively correlated with the winter bidecadal North Pacific Index (NPI) climate oscillation. McCall Glacier deuterium excess (d-excess, delta H-2 - 8*delta O-18) values display a bidecadal periodicity coherent with the NPI and suggest shifts from more southwestern Bering Sea moisture sources with less sea ice (lower d-excess values) to more northern Arctic Ocean moisture sources with more sea ice (higher d-excess values). Northern ice covered Arctic Ocean McCall Glacier moisture sources are associated with weak Aleutian Low (AL) circulation patterns and the southern moisture sources with strong AL patterns. Ice core d-excess values significantly decrease over the record, coincident with warmer temperatures and a significant reduction in Alaska sea ice concentration, which suggests that ice free northern ocean waters are increasingly serving as terrestrial precipitation moisture sources; a concept recently proposed by modeling studies and also present in Greenland ice core d-excess values during previous transitions to warm periods. This study also shows the efficacy and importance of using ice cores from Arctic valley glaciers in paleoclimate reconstructions. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At the northeastern limit of the species' range, hatchling turtles should seek aquatic hibernacula to avoid freezing; where emergence from the nest is delayed until late autumn, selection pressure for water-seeking behaviour should be strong. Using pigmented powder that fluoresces under UV light, 78 hatchlings from 12 lakeshore nests and 2 inland nests were tracked for a maximum of 11 days. On the first day after emergence, hatchling movement was random with respect to water. Hatchlings did not orient themselves with respect to slope, vegetation, or nestmates, nor did individuals follow a consistent compass bearing among days. Often trails were convoluted in the open and relatively straight under dense vegetation. Evidence suggests that hatchlings in this population may overwinter in terrestrial as well as aquatic hibernacula.																			0008-4301					SEP	1997	75	9					1387	1395		10.1139/z97-765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z97-765													WOS:A1997XX04100005

Status and Distribution of Cisco (Coregonus artedi) and Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in Inland Lakes of Wisconsin	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Coregonus artedi (Cisco) and Coregonus clupeaformis (Lake Whitefish) are coldwater fishes native to some inland lakes in Wisconsin. We conducted a statewide assessment of Cisco and Lake Whitefish status using experimental-mesh vertical gillnets during the summers of 2011-2014. Cisco and Lake Whitefish relative abundances varied from 0 to 137 and 0 to 3 fish/net night, respectively. About 29% of the Cisco and 33% of the Lake Whitefish populations were potentially extirpated from inland lakes in Wisconsin; most potential extirpations were from southern Wisconsin, but extirpations occurred statewide. Invasive species, climate change, land-use change, and excess nutrient loading may have contributed to causing extirpations of Cisco and Lake Whitefish. Conservation of remaining populations of Cisco and Lake Whitefish will require efforts to minimize these perturbations.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				JUL	2020	27	3					469	484		10.1656/045.027.0307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.027.0307													WOS:000576688300009

Watershed Development and Eutrophying Potable Source-Water Reservoirs in a Warming Temperate/Subtropical Region	WATER												Reservoirs are increasingly valuable worldwide as potable source waters, yet in many geographic regions, their limnology and trophic status are poorly known. We characterized 14 drinking water reservoirs and their watersheds across the warming temperate/subtropical southeastern USA. Selected reservoirs had at least three years of accessible summer water quality data during 2010-2020, including Secchi depth, nutrients, and algal biomass as chlorophyll a, and depth profiles for temperature and dissolved oxygen. Most watersheds, including lands within a 10-km radius of the reservoirs, had sustained substantial urbanization and/or intensive industrialized animal production, in some cases including the discharge of partially treated human sewage or livestock slaughterhouse wastes near or into the reservoirs. Five reservoirs were assessed as mesotrophic; the others were eutrophic. Most were stratified, but ephemeral near-surface thermoclines were common, and many were too shallow (median depth 5.0 m) to maintain uniform temperatures in the relatively warm hypolimnia. Bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia occurred throughout the summers but, surprisingly, in 8 of 14 reservoirs hypoxia commonly extended to surface waters. In the Southeast as in many regions, drinking water reservoirs are poorly protected and degrading as livestock production and/or urban development increasingly characterize their watersheds. The eutrophication trajectory of these valuable resources should be used as an indicator of ecosystem health and water quality in developing more protective management and policy actions.

J	Gilbert, R; Butler, RD				Gilbert, R; Butler, RD			The physical limnology and sedimentology of Meziadin Lake, northern British Columbia, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Meziadin Lake (34 km(2), 133 In maximum depth) is located on the east side of the Coast Mountains in northern British Columbia. Inflow from Strohn Creek is dominated by the nival flood, despite a glacier cover of 50.5 km(2) in the drainage basin. The nival flood generates turbid underflows in the lake that distribute sandy mud within 2 km of the point of inflow. During our study in 1999, turbidity currents and interflows along the thermocline continued intermittently through the summer, although the inflow of water and the suspended sediment loads decreased substantially. Sediment collected in traps throughout the lake indicate mass accumulation rates in the proximal region in excess of 200 g m(-2) d(-1) (11 mm) averaged over 69 d of observation during summer 1999, decreasing downtake to 1 g m(-2) d(-1) (0.06 mm) in the most distal region of the lake. The sediment trapped near the point of inflow has a strong mode of fine sand and is strongly negatively skewed, reflecting the competence of the turbidity currents. Texture of the sediments deposited on the lake floor decreases distally from material dominated by coarse silt and fine sand to clay sized material. Sub-bottom acoustic data document more than 180 m of accumulation in the proximal region, decreasing to <20 m distally, making the mean rates of accumulation since deglaciation (16 and 1.8 mm yr(-1), respectively) somewhat greater than those at present. This decrease is associated with changing environmental conditions and diversion of a significant portion of the drainage basin associated with the retreat of Strohn Glacier in the 20th century.																			1523-0430					FEB	2004	36	1					33	41		10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0033:TPLASO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0033:TPLASO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222951100004

Increasing extreme melt in northeast Greenland linked to foehn winds and atmospheric rivers	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing mass at an increased rate in recent decades. In northeast Greenland, increasing surface melt has accompanied speed-ups in the outlet glaciers of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, which contain over one meter of sea level rise potential. Here we show that the most intense northeast Greenland melt events are driven by atmospheric rivers (ARs) affecting northwest Greenland that induce foehn winds in the northeast. Near low-elevation outlet glaciers, 80-100% of extreme (> 99(th) percentile) melt occurs during foehn conditions and 50-75% during ARs. These events have become more frequent during the twenty-first century, with 5-10% of total northeast Greenland melt in several recent summers occurring during the similar to 1% of times with strong AR and foehn conditions. We conclude that the combined AR-foehn influence on northeast Greenland extreme melt will likely continue to grow as regional atmospheric moisture content increases with climate warming.					; Mattingly, Kyle/HMP-7305-2023; Wille, Jonathan/KFQ-5871-2024; Rennermalm, Asa/I-3270-2012; Mote, Thomas/U-6681-2017	Mattingly, Kyle/0000-0002-7384-0903; Turton, Jenny/0000-0003-0581-8293; Wille, Jonathan/0000-0002-3918-5204; Rennermalm, Asa/0000-0002-2470-7444; Mote, Thomas/0000-0002-0021-0134; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813														2041-1723				MAR 29	2023	14	1							1743	10.1038/s41467-023-37434-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37434-8								36990994					WOS:000983816800014
J	Park, C; Schmincke, HU				Park, Cornelia; Schmincke, Hans-Ulrich			Multistage damming of the Rhine River by tephra fallout during the 12,900 BP Plinian Laacher See Eruption (Germany). Syn-eruptive Rhine damming I	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Rhine - the largest river in Western Europe - was dammed during the Plinian Laacher See Eruption (LSE; 12,900 BP). Damming during the climactic Plinian episode of LSE occurred both upstream and downstream of the broad tectonic Lower Neuwied Basin (LNB) that interrupts the narrow Rhine canyon. We here document details of the upstream damming at the bottleneck entrance to the LNB near the present city of Koblenz. Our reconstruction is based on a high-resolution analysis and correlation of the complex intercalation of primary fallout tephra relics with fluvially reworked Laacher See Tephra in the LNB. Tephra units representing complete eruptive cycles repeatedly fell on drained ground in between one minor and 4 major flooding events - even at the base of side channels that had been active prior to the LSE and that had been flooded by a preceding flooding event. This demonstrates that flooding occurred generally during breaks and not during fallout events. The repeated formation and breach of a dam at the upstream entrance of the LNB (Koblenz Dam) consisting of fallout components and driftwood washed together convincingly explains the multiple repetition of the drainage of the channels in the LNB followed by large-magnitude flooding in rapid succession. The strongly pulsating nature of the LSE reflected in multiple interruptions of eruptive activity fundamentally controlled the damming and flooding dynamics. The Rhine became completely blocked during distinct fallout phases due to overloading with pumice that had fallen into the river and its major tributaries. The temporary dam collapsed during eruptive breaks. This is the first recorded example of tephra fallout damming a major watercourse. The extremely low gradient of the Rhine River allowed the repeated accumulation of large volumes of water in a long, multi-phase dammed-up lake (Lake Koblenz) that extended along the upstream course of the river for up to c. 30 km despite the low height (<10 m) of the dams. Each breach of Koblenz Dam caused extensive and wide-spread erosion and reworking of freshly deposited tephra throughout the entire LNB up to 7 km perpendicular to the major axial Rhine channel. The floods deposited striking, large-scale upper flow regime structures interpreted as in-phase wave draping, antidunes and chute-and-pool structures consisting largely of gravel-sized tephra components. Primary tephra sheets - several meters thick - became detached by undercurrents above impermeable boundaries and floated potentially along the full length of both active and abandoned channels. Large tephra bodies with the dimensions of a garage were lifted off by the flood waves and transported downstream for at least tens of meters. Damming of a major river while a large Plinian eruption is in full progress represents an extraordinary challenge for hazard mitigation. This is especially pertinent for an area close to, and downwind from, the vent and therefore simultaneously affected by massive Plinian fall such as in the LNB. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing Discharge Computation Methods in Great Lakes Connecting Channels	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Records of discharge for the connecting channels within the Great Lakes Basin are important to national governments of Canada and the United States and the various water management agencies and users in the basin. For more than 100 years, the official discharge records for the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, two connecting channels within the Great Lakes Basin, have been computed using various stage-fall-discharge (SFQ) methods. However, as a result of technological advancements, newer methods have recently been considered for discharge computations. In this study, three discharge computation methods were compared: two SFQ methods and the index-velocity discharge (IVQ) method. Although the two SFQ methods have significantly different assumptions and use different data from the index-velocity method, the differences between the computed discharges derived from the methods are small, especially as the time step approaches monthly discharge values. Statistical analyses of discharge measurements and discharges computed using each of these methods indicate that there is no substantive difference in the discharges computed using the three methods. However, the IVQ method provides distinct advantages over the SFQ methods, including increased temporal resolution of computed discharge (minutes versus daily) and the ability to account for changes caused by aquatic vegetation and ice. Based on the results of the comparisons described herein, the IVQ discharge computation method is the most appropriate method for discharge computation in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. Updated SFQ equations for the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, also presented herein, can be used to compute discharge during periods of missing or invalid IVQ record.					; Calappi, Tim/IVV-7449-2023	thompson, aaron/0000-0001-7291-8476; 													1084-0699	1943-5584				JUN 1	2020	25	6							05020007	10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001904													WOS:000527795100006

Similar events at Kilauea have been described as the result of sporadic degassing following gas accumulation beneath a mostly impermeable lava lake surface. Incorporation of SO2 camera data into a multi-parameter dataset gives credence to the likelihood of shallow gas accumulation as the cause of these high stand events, with accumulated gas release upon lake-level drop compensating for the gas deficit reached during accumulation.

Production and release of dimethyl sulfide from the Great Lakes	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Dimethyl sulfide has been detected in all the water samples from Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario. The average concentrations in the surface waters were 5.2 ng l(-1) for Lake Superior, 16 ng l(-1) (June) and 7.3 ng l(-1) (August) for Lake Erie and 27 ng l(-1) (June) and 13 ng l(-1) (August) for Lake Ontario. The profiles in the water column and the seasonal variations (with highest concentrations following after the crash of spring diatom bloom) suggest that DMS production in these lakes stems primarily from the microbial decomposition of dead algal cells. Only a small fraction (< 5%) of the sulfur used in planktonic protein synthesis is converted to DMS, however. The emissions of DMS to the atmosphere were calculated to be 107, 49 and 69 tonnes year(-1) respectively in Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario.

Atmospheric deposition of current-use and historic-use pesticides in snow at national parks in the Western United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The United States (U.S.) National Park Service has initiated research on the atmospheric deposition and fate of semi-volatile organic compounds in its alpine, sub-Arctic, and Arctic ecosystems in the Western U. S. Results for the analysis of pesticides in seasonal snowpack samples collected in spring 2003 from seven national parks are presented herein. From a target analyte list of 47 pesticides and degradation products, the most frequently detected current-use pesticides were dacthal, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, whereas the most frequently detected historic-use pesticides were dieldrin, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, chlordane, and hexachlorobenzene. Correlation analysis with latitude, temperature, elevation, particulate matter, and two indicators of regional pesticide use reveal that regional current and historic agricultural practices are largely responsible for the distribution of pesticides in the national parks in this study. Pesticide deposition in the Alaskan parks is attributed to long-range transport because there are no significant regional pesticide sources. The percentage of total pesticide concentration due to regional transport (%RT) was calculated for the other parks. %RT was highest at parks with higher regional cropland intensity and for pesticides with lower vapor pressures and shorter half-lives in air.

Transformation of Estimated Characteristics of the Annual and Maximal Runoff in the Major Tributaries of Lake Baikal	WATER RESOURCES												Hydrometric data of recent years were used to evaluate the parameters of distribution of the annual and maximal runoff in the major tributaries of Lake Baikal: the Selenga, Upper Angara, and Barguzin. The estimates of the mean water content, maximal water discharges of spring flood and rain freshets were obtained. The comparison with analogous data of an earlier period often shows significant difference. Variations of the characteristics under consideration are taking place against the background of warming in the region since the early 1970s. The results of the current transformation of river runoff variations is a change in Baikal water regime, which determines the restructuring of hydrological processes in the lake.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2017	44	3					372	379		10.1134/S0097807817030174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807817030174													WOS:000405126000003

A Juniperus peak, the first occurrence of Typha latifolia, a first find of Donacia cinerea and a shift in .delta.18O all point to rapidly increasing temperatures at around 12,600 BP. A second rise in temperature is recorded by vegetation and oxygen isotopes at around 10,000 BP. .delta.18O, beetles and waterplants seem to reflect the climatic change with no or very short response-times. Corylus, however, arrives after a long lag, which may partly be due to slow dispersal, partly to high seasonality (very cold winters) during the Younger Dryas (11,000 to 10,000 BP). In order to understand the biotic response to a changing climate, it is necessary to study not only closely tracing species, but a variety of taxa with different life-cycle characteristics.																			0012-9402						1989	82	1					183	190																WOS:A1989AK61800006

The study aimed to analyse the effects of water discharge, temperature and chemistry on phytoplankton dynamic and species composition in the lowland reach of the eutrophic Po river (Italy). Both taxonomical and morpho-functional methods were used. True planktonic and tychoplanktic (i.e. detached taxa of benthic origin that remain in suspension) species were found, among which only a few taxa and functional groups prevailed. Diatoms were the most abundant, with a clear dominance of species either sensitive to the onset of water stratification or well adapted to turbid waters. Phytoplankton abundance, biomass and chlorophyll-a followed similar trends, attaining the highest values in summer, at low discharge rates. Correlation and multivariate analysis revealed that the development of a stable phytoplankton community was mainly controlled by water discharge rates. Namely, changes in water flow rates induced major variations in the community structure. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton assemblages was also related to water temperature and dissolved reactive silica availability to some extent overlapping flow effects.

These parasites have developed a number of strategies to invade vertebrates. Since we have little understanding of the behavior of these parasites inside the human body, the monitoring of their invasion in snail host populations is highly recommended. In our research, lymnaeid snails were collected from several Polish lakes for two vegetation seasons. The prevalence of bird schistosomes in snail host populations was significantly lower than that of other digenean species. We were the first to detect the presence of the snails emitted Trichobilharzia regenti (potentially the most dangerous nasal schistosome) in Poland. In addition, by sequencing partial rDNA genes, we confirmed the presence of the snails positive with Trichobilharzia szidati in Polish water bodies, showing that swimmer's itch is more frequent during summer months and that large snails are more often infected with bird schistosomes than small ones.

J	Biro, PA				Biro, PA			Staying cool: Behavioral thermoregulation during summer by young-of-year brook trout in a lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Thermal habitat selection and behavior by young-of-year brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis was studied in a lake in central Ontario. Canada. In May, trout foraged actively within 2 m of shore in the warmest water available (similar to 15 degrees C). In early June, trout foraged near the bottom within 4 m of shore, where bottom water temperatures were near, or at, the upper thermal tolerance. for trout, of 20 degrees C. In July, when ambient water temperatures ranted from 23 degrees C to 27 degrees C, trout lay on the bottom in the coldest water available (18-20 degrees C) in discrete arena 3-8 m from shore. Flow rate of cold groundwater accounted for 87% of the variance in trout density in these areas, and the data suggest that a minimum flow rate of 125 mL.m(-2).m(-1) is required for trout to take up station. When trout were displaced from holding positions, sites with greater groundwater flow were more quickly reoccupied by trout than sites with lower flow. Experimentally created trough like depressions at these sites attracted higher densities of trout than the same sites with their natural topography and restricted trout distribution to within each depression. Preliminary behavioral observations suggest that trout lie on the bottom and defend cool microhabitats at the expense of daytime feeding. These results suggest that areas with cold groundwater may be a limiting resource for young-of-year brook trout in the littoral zone during summer and resource managers should consider protecting such areas from lakeshore development and logging.

In this study, diffuse a nd point source components of total Hg loadings in the Lower Minnesota River (Minnesota) were characterized using clean sampling and analytical techniques. Large seasonal differences in river Hg concentrations and loadings were observed, showing dramatic increases in response to spring snowmelt and precipitation events. Approximately 98% of the annual Hg load in the river was carried during the 9 months from March through November. Total Hg concentrations were highly correlated with total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations, and filtration experiments confirmed the strong association of Hg with suspended sediments. Measured point source Hg loadings accounted for only 1% of the total annual river Hg loading. These results indicate that Hg inputs to the Lower Minnesota River are driven by sediment input processes in the basin and suggest that efforts to control sediment inputs are necessary to reduce Hg loadings.																			0013-936X					JAN	1997	31	1					198	202		10.1021/es960327t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960327t													WOS:A1997WC40000047

It is found that fatness of the juvenile Amur sleeper does not change with an increasing body length. The seasonal dynamics of fatness is expressed to a greater degree in fish of the same size. The lipid composition of juvenile specimens of the Amur sleeper varies considerably depending on the length of the body of the fry and the time of observation. The character of the fractional composition of lipids in yearlings of the Amur sleeper with body lengths >25-29 mm in September and October indicates a decline in food supply of the largest specimens of the generation by the end of the active feeding period and their lower readiness for wintering.

Relative trophic levels were determined by stable isotope analysis. POP levels in surface water, sediment and biota were low. Only Sigma DDTs levels in fish muscle (<LOQ-61 ng/g ww) were comparable or higher than values from other temperate and tropical regions. Significant positive relationships between relative trophic level and PCB, DDT and HCH concentrations were observed so trophic levels play an important role in the movement of contaminants through the food web. TMFs were >1, indicating biomagnification of all detected POPs. Calculated TMFs for PCBs were comparable to TMF values reported from the tropical Congo River basin and lower than TMFs from temperate and arctic regions. For p,p'-DDT, a higher TMF value was observed for the subtropical Olifants River during the winter low flow season than for the tropical Congo river. TMFs of DDTs from the present study were unexpectedly higher than TMFs from temperate and arctic aquatic food webs. The fish species in the aquatic ecosystem of the Olifants River can be consumed with a low risk for POP contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, JM; Lyu, N; Cheng, WD; Zhou, LZ				Zhao, Jin-Ming; Lyu, Nan; Cheng, Wenda; Zhou, Li-Zhi			Cryptic competition from neighbours significantly reduces intake rate of foraging greater white-fronted geese	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												The idea that animals gain a higher food intake rate when foraging in larger groups has been reported in many studies. However, some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size. In addition, the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons. We observed the foraging behaviours of 490 individual geese from 71 flocks during December 2016-March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui, China. We found that mean foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate were not influenced by flock size, whereas, at the individual scale these variables were significantly affected by the number of neighbours and position within a flock. Moreover, the effect of the number of neighbours on the foraging parameters did not differ between central and peripheral individuals, despite central individuals always having greater foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate regardless of the number of neighbours. Both the decreased foraging time and decreased foraging efficiency indicated a potential increase in cryptic competition from neighbours. More neighbours contributed to a decreased intake rate. Our study highlights the possible effects of cryptic competition among neighbours on their foraging behaviour. We hypothesize that an increase in intraspecific competition between neighbours in areas of shrinking wetland habitats may contribute to population declines of wintering geese and other wildfowl.

The study carries out non-parametric trend analysis of gridded DTR monthly data sourced from Climatic Research Unit (CRU). The DTR exhibits mixed signals in space and time over EA. The DTR correlates negatively with rainfall over EA. Reduction in DTR coincides with the summer season in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively, suggesting the influence of cloud cover on it. There was a non-uniform pattern of DTR changes across the region with time. Lake Victoria basin recorded the highest warming rates. The Indian Ocean coast recorded the least spatiotemporal variability in DTR. A reduction in DTR is evident in the two seasons: hot and cold. The start of the study period; 1921-1930, was the coolest decade in the study period. Most parts of EA recorded negative DTR anomalies in 1961-1970. The overall reduction in DTR throughout the study period highlights the ongoing warming which is a global phenomenon. There remains need for investigating the causation of the observed DTR variability for effective monitoring of the variability in future.																			1006-8775					DEC	2017	23	4					345	356		10.16555/j.1006-8775.2017.04.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.16555/j.1006-8775.2017.04.001													WOS:000417264400001

Wintertime decoupling of urban valley and rural ridge hydrological processes revealed through stable water isotopes	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Water from fossil fuel combustion can represent > 10% of urban specific humidity, but this fraction is difficult to constrain from meteorological measurements alone. Stable water vapor isotopes can be used to estimate the fraction of combustion-derived vapor (CDV) and characterize the contrast between anthropogenically-altered and natural systems due to CDV's distinctive isotope composition. However, accurate estimates of the CDV fraction of urban humidity requires information on vapor isotope ratios in the absence of anthropogenic emissions. We present data from an urban site in Salt Lake City, UT and from a high-elevation site in the adjacent Wasatch Mountains. Urban vapor d-excess values (d-excess = delta H-2-8 delta O-18) closely track CO2 concentrations on diurnal to weekly timescales, but high-elevation vapor values do not. Instead, the high-elevation site captures large-scale atmospheric variability, with d-excess changes largely following changes in delta O-18 and humidity. Isotope ratios at the two sites remain distinct throughout most of the winter, indicating that these sites are regularly decoupled from each other and that high-elevation winter measurements may rarely be representative of valley conditions in the absence of urban emissions. Furthermore, high-elevation d-excess may be higher than emissions-free values at the same elevation as the urban area, as vapor d-excess changes non-linearly during condensation at low specific humidity, and would result in an overestimate of urban humidity amounts. Therefore, the high-elevation site may not help place additional constraints on the amount of CDV in urban systems, yet the paired sites show changes in vapor isotope ratios, particularly in d-excess, that capture differences in urban and natural impacts on water vapor cycling.

J	ROWE, GL				ROWE, GL			OXYGEN, HYDROGEN, AND SULFUR ISOTOPE SYSTEMATICS OF THE CRATER LAKE SYSTEM OF POAS VOLCANO, COSTA-RICA	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotope data for fluids and minerals associated with the crater lake of Poas Volcano, Costa Rica, are interpreted in the context of the chemical and hydrologic structure of the volcano. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data were obtained for rain, spring, and river water, low-temperature fumarole condensates, and acid brines collected from the hot crater lake before its disappearance in April 1989. Flank river and spring waters whose solute compositions have been modified by volcanic and hydrothermal activity have, with one exception, isotopic compositions similar to local meteoric water. Acid chloride-sulfate brines of the summit crater lake are extremely enriched in O-18 with respect to local meteoric water; in the most enriched brines O-18 shifts are greater than 20parts per thousand. The O-18 shift is related to a kinetic isotope effect associated with the intense evaporation at the surface of the lake. These same brines exhibit only minimal shifts in their D/H ratios. The apparent lack of deuterium fractionation in the brines is attributed to an increase in the flux of isotopically light steam into the crater lake and/or a decrease in the deuterium fractionation factor for evaporation that occurs at the surface of the lake. The decrease in deuterium fractionation is correlated with large increases in lake-brine acidity and dissolved solids concentration that preceded the disappearance of the lake. Sulfur isotope data are presented for H2S and SO2 gas collected from low temperature fumaroles; dissolved sulfate in spring, river, and crater lake waters; and native sulfur and gypsum found in the acid lake and active crater area. DELTA(SO2)-H2S for low temperature gases is approximately 24parts per thousand indicating an equilibration temperature of 165-degrees-C. DELTA(SO4)-H2S for low temperature H2S and lake brine sulfate is approximately 23parts per thousand, all indicating subsurface equilibration occurred at 265-degrees-C. The H2S and native sulfur are both highly depleted in S-34 (delta(S-34) = -8 to -11parts per thousand). delta(S-34) values of S-34-depleted H2S and S-34-enriched sulfate in lake brine are produced by disproportionation of SO2 released by the shallow magma body. Native sulfur is formed by the oxidation of S-34-depleted H2S by non-sulfur-bearing oxidants such as atmospheric oxygen and ferric iron. Mass-balance calculations indicate that sulfitolysis of polythionic acids could also result in the deposition of significant quantities of native sulfur. Implications of the isotopic composition of present-day fluids observed at Poas Volcano with respect to the isotope systematics of acid-sulfate ore deposits are considered.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1994	28	3					263	287																WOS:A1994PL10400010

Late-Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability revealed from a 3300-year-long lake sediment record from Nir'pa Co, southeastern Tibet	HOLOCENE												Sedimentological and geochemical results from Nir'pa Co, an alpine lake on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, detail late-Holocene Indian summer monsoon (ISM) hydroclimate during the last 3300 years. Constrained by modern calibration, elevated silt and lithics and low sand and clay between 3.3 and 2.4 ka and 1.3 ka and the present indicate two pluvial phases with lake levels near their current overflow elevation. Between 2.4 and 1.3 ka, a sharp increase in sand and corresponding decrease in lithics and silt suggest drier conditions and lower lake levels at Nir'pa Co. Hydroclimate expressions in the sedimentological proxies during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age' (LIA) are not statistically significant, suggesting that these events were minor compared to the millennial scale variability on which they were superimposed. However, decreasing sand and increasing lithics and silt during the MCA between 950 and 800 cal. yr BP may suggest briefly wetter conditions, while increasing sand and reduced lithics and silt from 500 to 200 cal. yr BP suggest potentially drier conditions during the LIA. Similarities with regional records from lake sediment and ice cores and speleothem records from the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau, India, and the Arabian Sea, suggest generally coherent late-Holocene ISM variability in these regions. Increased late-Holocene ISM intensity occurred during times when Tibetan Plateau surface air temperatures were warmer, Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures were elevated, and the tropical Pacific was in a La Nina-like mean state. Conversely, aridity between 2.4 and 1.3 ka occurred in concert with cooling on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Indo-Pacific with more El Nino-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. Differences with western Tibetan records may reflect a weakened ISM and stronger westerlies in this region during the late-Holocene.

In this study, the role of silicon (Si) in the release of P from the sediment surface layer was studied in a marine estuarine environment, the Bay of Brest, with the aid of a sequential sediment fractionation procedure developed for P, and the addition of inorganic or diatom-bound Si to surface sediment samples in vitro. The potentially mobile pools of P in the surface sediment (loosely bound P + Fe/Al-bound-P) amounted to 5.0 mu mol g(-1) dry sed., 42% of the total extractable and 33% of the total amount of P in the sediment, while the similarly extracted pools of Si were bigger (ca. 20 mu mol g(-1) dry sed., 50% of the total extractable Si). Additions of inorganic Si increased the concentration of dissolved P in the sediment interstitial water in a bottle experiment, and the addition of both inorganic Si and cultivated diatoms to intact sediment cores increased the outward flux of dissolved P. Model calculations based on the regression equation from the bottle experiment and Si and P water column data showed that the sedimentation of spring diatoms could cause Si pulses to the sediment which would produce a P flux to the water column of ca. 44 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Field data from the bay show that in spring, decreases in P and Si and an increase in chl a due to diatom production are often followed by a small separate P peak which may be caused by Si-induced P fluxes from the sediment surface.

An analysis of satellite-derived chlorophyll and algal bloom indices on Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Winnipeg has experienced dramatic increases in nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass over the last few decades, accompanied by a marked shift in community composition towards the dominance of cyanobacteria. Comprehensive lake-wide observations of algal blooms are critical to assessing the lake's health status, its response to nutrient management practices, and an improved understanding of the processes driving blooms. We present an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of algal blooms on Lake Winnipeg using satellite-derived chlorophyll and indices for algal bloom intensity, spatial extent, severity, and duration over the period of ESA's MERIS mission (2002-2011). Imagery documented extensive blooms covering as much as 93% of the lake surface. Bloom conditions were analysed in the context of in-lake and watershed processes to gain further insight on the drivers of bloom events. Day to day bloom variability was driven primarily by intermittent wind mixing events, with quiescent periods leading to the formation of dense surface blooms. Seasonal bloom distribution was consistent with light limitation in the south basin and lake circulation transporting bloom material towards the north-east shore. Inter-annual variability in average bloom severity was related to both total phosphorus (TP) loadings and summer lake surface temperatures. Results provide a valuable historical time series of bloom conditions to which ongoing observations from Sentinel-3's OLCI sensor can be added for longer term monitoring and change detection.

The development of the lake ice process of Chagan Lake was monitored using MODIS and Landsat images over eight consecutive snow seasons from October 2013 to April 2021. We derived the lake ice phenology from an eight-day time series of lake water skin temperature (LWST) provided by MODIS, including freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice cover duration. We discovered a large-scale fracture extending from northwest to southeast that repeatedly appeared on Landsat images since 1986. A novel fractal-based auto-extraction is proposed to extract the length and angle of these fractures. We also carried out a field campaign and an ice ridge was found at the southernmost part of what we observed from the images. Moreover, we explained the fracturing development by thermal changes, wind in lake, and underlying flow. Results show that the lake ice fracture is nearly perpendicular to the dominant wind direction in the cold season, which indicates the crucial role of wind on lake ice fracturing.					; Liu, Xuemei/HSG-6255-2023	chen, liwen/0000-0002-8432-9406; hao, xiaohua/0000-0002-4636-979X														2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	21							4233	10.3390/rs13214233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214233													WOS:000722342700001

C/N (range: 0.3-100), delta C-13 (range: -28 to -15 parts per thousand), and n-alkane measurements yielded further information on the quantitative composition of sedimentary organic matter. The inferred primary production of the former lake ecosystem has been examined in respect of the alternative stable state theory of shallow lakes [Scheffer, M., 1989. Alternative stable states in eutrophic, shallow freshwater systems: a minimal model. Hydrobiological Bulletin 23, 73-83]. Switches between clear and turbid water conditions are explained by a colder climate and forest decline in the catchment area of Lake Luanhaizi. The macrofossil-based reconstruction of past water depth and salinity ranges, as well as other organic matter (OM) proxies allowed climatic inferences of the summer monsoon intensity during the late Quaternary. Around 45 ka BP, conditions similar to or even moister than present-day climate occurred. The Lake Luanhaizi record is further evidence against an extensive glaciation of the Tibetan Plateau and its bordering mountain ranges during the Last Glacial Maximum. Highest lake levels and consequently a strong summer monsoon are recorded for the early Holocene period, while gradually decreasing lake levels are reconstructed for the middle and late Holocene.

These changes are likely to impact the timing and magnitude of dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs to lakes from the surrounding catchment. We examined temporal dynamics of DOM using in situ optical sensors that measured DOM fluorescence (fDOM) through the ice-free season in five lakes with differing catchment characteristics. We also measured changes in lake level and compiled daily meteorological data from nearby weather stations. At a seasonal time scale, fDOM dynamics occurred in two phases. fDOM declined in the first phase, which lasted until late July - mid-August, and corresponded to a decline in lake level following spring snowmelt. This decline was more pronounced in lakes with more vegetated catchments. At a shorter time scale, fDOM increased following precipitation events with a 0- to 1-day lag. Rates of fDOM increase per centmetre change in lake level were greater in lakes with vegetated catchments. As climate change increases vegetation coverage, DOM will likely become more dynamic at daily and seasonal time scales and impact water transparency and productivity of mountain lakes.

While a certain amount of Cr(III) is required for human metabolism, Cr(VI) is known to have toxic and carcinogenic effects for all living species. Chromium compounds are widely used in different fields, such as electroplating, dyeing, photographic and textile industries. Owing to this reason, it and its compounds can easily interfere with the water resources. Because of differences in toxicity, it is important to develop a sensitive analytical method for the speciation, preconcentration and determination of chromium species in the water resources. In this work, speciation and preconcentration of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were performed using Amberlite CG-120 resin before detection step by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The experimental conditions for model solutions were optimized so that Cr(III) was adsorbed in a column while Cr(VI) was not. To perform this, some experimental parameters, such as pH, eluent' type/concentration/flow rate, sample solution flow rate and adsorbent amount were optimized. Furthermore, Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) to determine total chromium. Then, Cr(VI) was calculated by the differences between total chromium and Cr(III). The limit of detection (3 s) and preconcentration factor were found to be 0.3 mu g L-1 and 600, respectively. This proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of inorganic chromium species in the different spring waters supplied from Isparta province (Eyupler Village), Burdur province (Aglasun County), the commercial drinking water samples purchased from local market in Burdur province, and the waste water supplied from Isparta province (Suleyman Demirel Organized Industrial Region) at Turkey. The accuracy of the method was successfully checked by certified reference material (TMDA-70.2 Ontario Lake water) at 95% confidence level.

The impact of a summer research internship program on research engagement of osteopathic medical students	JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE												Context Research plays a critical role in the medical field, driving progress and shaping clinical guidelines. It has become particularly significant in the residency application process due to the advent of "pass or fail" scoring for Step 1. Unfortunately, there is a marked discrepancy between the quantity of research conducted by osteopathic and allopathic students, disadvantaging many osteopathic residency applicants. Objectives Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM)-Bradenton established the Summer Research Internship Program in 2023 to improve research self-efficacy, facilitate research participation, and encourage lifelong research engagement in Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate participant research experience and self-efficacy through pre- and postprogram surveys. Methods This study consisted of an experimental group of 18 students who participated in this program. A control group consisted of 20 students not enrolled in the program who had minimal research experience and no plans to conduct research throughout the study's duration. Participants completed pre- and postprogram surveys, assessing research experience and self-efficacy across four domains: knowledge of research foundations, ability to identify scholarly literature, motivation to conduct research, and likelihood of future engagement. Data were analyzed via a quantitative Likert scale. Results The experimental group reported significantly greater (p<0.05) research experience pre- and postprogram including poster creation, LECOM Research Day participation, and publication history. The experimental group also had significantly (p<0.05) more experience with manuscript preparation postprogram compared to the controls. For the self-efficacy survey, the experimental group had higher (p<0.05) motivation to perform research prior to the start of the program compared to the controls. Moreover, this group gained greater (p<0.05) experience in research foundations and identification of the literature postprogram compared with controls. Conclusions The LECOM Summer Research Internship Program significantly enhanced research experience and self-efficacy among participants when compared to controls. This program study may serve as a model for other institutions seeking to expand student research engagement and build a culture of scholarly activity. Expanding successful structured research programs may also help address the disparity in research output between osteopathic and allopathic medical students.					; Bishayee, Anupam/G-4290-2012	Bishayee, Anupam/0000-0001-9159-960X; 														2702-3648				2025 JUL 25	2025										10.1515/jom-2025-0056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jom-2025-0056		JUL 2025						40704496					WOS:001535278700001

Jun; Mao, Boyang; Jia, Shunqing			Extreme drought affects lake water quality, quantity, morphometry: Evidence from China's largest fresh water lake under the 2022 global drought	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Extreme drought poses a significant threat to humanity. In the summer of 2022, the world experienced the worst drought in recent years, with a precipitation deficit and an abnormal high temperature, profoundly affecting human life and the aquatic environment. However, the drought influence on large freshwater lakes remains unclear. In this study, we selected China's largest freshwater lake (Poyang Lake) as the research object and investigated the lake water area, quantity, lake morphology and water quality in 2018 (normal season) and 2022 (extreme drought period). Results showed that standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized runoff index (SRI) and standardized precipitation-evapotranspira tion index (SPEI) reached moderate to severe drought in the summer of 2022. From 2018 to 2022, lake water area decreased (1789.62 km2), water quantity reduced (15.40 x 109 m3 ) and lake shoreline decreased (2923.70 km). The shoreline development index, size ratio and energy factor decreased by 4.87, 198.53 m and 963.60, specifically. The dynamic ratio, relative depth and Schindler's ratio increased by 1457.10, 0.04 and 13.48 m-1, respectively. The water chemical indicators varied significantly in two years and the water hydrochemical types changed from SO4 Cl-Ca Mg type and HCO3-Ca Mg type to SO4 Cl-Ca Mg type from 2018 to 2022. Water-rock interaction, alternating cation adsorption and anthropogenic influence on water quality represented different patterns in two periods. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in water resources and quality between common and extreme drought conditions in China's largest fresh water lake, which can inform research on climate change effects on international large freshwater lakes.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The effects of multiple stressors (salinity, temperature, nutrient and light availability or human activities) on the abundance of FIB (Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae) were studied in nine lakes on the southern Baltic coast. Monitoring also included physicochemical factors and land use in the catchment. The results showed that FIB is a natural component of microbial community in coastal lakes, with its abundance varying temporally and spatially. The key factors predicting the abundance of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae are the availability of ammonia nitrogen and water temperature. Regardless of the degree of connection with the sea, the sanitary condition of coastal lakes deteriorates during the summer months. Although agricultural use and residential development do not significantly affect fecal bacteria counts (PLS-R model), human pressure on the sanitary condition of lakes increases seasonally and is limited to the vicinity of tourist sites. The degree of contact with seawater regulates the size of the microbial community, but is not a factor that directly affects the presence of E. coli in the microbial community in coastal lakes. Monitoring the sanitary conditions of these ecosystems using sensitive, rapid survey methods based on hydrochemical and microbiological inventories, supported by GIS, is important for public health.					; Grzybowski, Mirosław/U-3923-2019; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; Grzybowski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-1887-7498; Lew, Sylwia/0000-0003-1408-4041; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286; Burandt, Pawel/0000-0001-6514-4361													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2023	152								110370	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110370		MAY 2023											WOS:001009446400001

Due to the importance of local to regional environmental drivers in mediating fire frequencies, reconstructing fire histories of representative geographic regions is important to understand fire regimes and predict future changes. The present study aims to establish a relatively high-resolution fire record of boreal forests in northeastern (NE) China and identify the primary environmental drivers. We analyzed the concentration and stable carbon isotopic composition of black carbon (BC and delta C-13(BC)) of a 34,000 cal yr BP sedimentary sequence from a crater lake (Tianchi). The results show that fire events and C-4 plants were scarce during the late Last Glacial but increased since the deglaciation. Both fire and the abundance of combusted C-4 plants reached their maxima during the early Holocene, which may be attributed to rising temperatures due to intensified solar radiation and summer monsoons. During mid-to-late Holocene, fire events remained relatively stable and were primary associated with C-3 plants burning. Fire was particularly infrequent and C-3 trees were abundant during the periods of 5500-3100 cal yr BP and 1500-150 cal yr BP, which can be attributed to a wet climate. Fires exhibited evident increases from 150 cal yr BP to the present, suggesting a substantial role of human activities. Both BC and delta C-13(BC) during the Holocene show a significant correlation with pollen-based temperatures but not with precipitation, suggesting that temperature rises played a primary role in stimulating forest fires via mediating effective moisture. Collectively, these findings suggest that forest fires and C-4 plants would likely increase in NE China in response to global warming and increasingly intensive anthropogenic disturbance, highlighting the importance of establishing a long-term understanding of fire regimes to create more sustainable, science-based fire management strategies.					; Lu, Yuehan/M-8803-2015; Zhou, Xin/AIE-7442-2022	Lu, Yuehan/0000-0002-0536-532X; Zhou, Xin/0000-0003-2640-6431													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 15	2021	562								110075	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110075													WOS:000604584600013

We have investigated the potential effects of climate change on the primary productivity of Castle Lake, a mountain lake in Northern California. Annual algal productivity was modeled empirically using 25 years of limnological data in order to establish predictive relationships between productivity and the climatic variables of accumulated snow depth and precipitation. The outputs of monthly temperature and precipitation from three general circulation models (GCMs) of doubled atmospheric CO2 were then used in the regression model to predict annual algal productivity. In all cases, the GCM senarios predicted increased algal productivity for Castle Lake under conditions of doubled atmospheric CO2. The primary cause of enhanced productivity was the increased length of the growing season resulting from earlier spring ice-out.																			0043-1370					DEC	1990	26	6					983	989																WOS:A1990FF19800013

Glacier response to North Atlantic climate variability during the Holocene	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Small glaciers and ice caps respond rapidly to climate variations, and records of their past extent provide information on the natural envelope of past climate variability. Millennial-scale trends in Holocene glacier size are well documented and correspond with changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. However, there is only sparse and fragmentary evidence for higher-frequency variations in glacier size because in many Northern Hemisphere regions glacier advances of the past few hundred years were the most extensive and destroyed the geomorphic evidence of ice growth and retreat during the past several thousand years. Thus, most glacier records have been of limited use for investigating centennial-scale climate forcing and feedback mechanisms. Here we report a continuous record of glacier activity for the last 9.5 ka from southeast Greenland derived from high-resolution measurements on a proglacial lake sediment sequence. Physical and geochemical parameters show that the glaciers responded to previously documented Northern Hemisphere climatic excursions, including the '8.2 ka' cooling event, the Holocene Thermal Maximum, Neoglacial cooling, and 20th century warming. In addition, the sediments indicate centennial-scale oscillations in glacier size during the late Holocene. Beginning at 4.1 ka, a series of abrupt glacier advances occurred, each lasting similar to 100 years and followed by a period of retreat, that were superimposed on a gradual trend toward larger glacier size. Thus, while declining summer insolation caused long-term cooling and glacier expansion during the late Holocene, climate system dynamics resulted in repeated episodes of glacier expansion and retreat on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. These episodes coincided with ice rafting events in the North Atlantic Ocean and periods of regional ice cap expansion, which confirms their regional significance and indicates that considerable glacier activity on these timescales is a normal feature of the cryosphere. The data provide a longer-term perspective on the rate of 20th century glacier retreat and indicate that recent anthropogenic-driven warming has already impacted the regional cryosphere in a manner outside the natural range of Holocene variability.

Additional watershed characteristics were derived from GIS coverages of watershed, hydrological and climatic variables. Maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT), computed as an index of summer thermal regime, ranged from 10 to 23 degrees C. High values of MWAT were associated with large, warm, low relief watersheds with a high lake influence. Measures of community similarity suggested that the fish community changed most rapidly through a lower transition zone at an MWAT of about 12 degrees C and an upper transition zone at an MWAT of about 19 degrees C. These results were confirmed using existing fisheries inventory data combined with predictions of MWAT from a landscape-scale regression model for the Thompson River watershed. For headwater sites in the Chilcotin River watershed (which drains into the middle Fraser River), the relative dominance of bull trout versus rainbow trout (based on inventory data) decreased with increasing predicted MWAT although the distinction was not as clear as for the Thompson River sites. The fish communities in these watersheds can be characterized in terms of very cold water (bull trout and some cold water species), cold water (salmonids and sculpins) and cool water (minnows and some cold water salmonids). The two transition zones (ca 12 and 19 degrees C) can be used to identify thresholds where small changes in stream temperature can be expected to lead to large changes in fish communities. Such clear, quantifiable thresholds are critical components of a management strategy designed to identify and protect vulnerable fish communities in streams where poor land use practices, alone or in combination with climatic change, can lead to changes in stream temperatures.

This population exists outside the native geographical range of chinook salmon and completes its entire life cycle in freshwater. Female weights and lengths, total fecundity, relative fecundity (eggs/mm), egg size, and egg survival were all considerably less than reported for anadromous chinook salmon stocks in their native range. Mean weight of spawning females was 2.73 kg in 1988 and 2.01 kg in 1998. Total fecundity was not significantly different at 2,892 eggs in 1988 and 2,496 eggs in 1998. Egg survival to the eyed stage averaged 37.7% in 1988 and 43.8% in 1998 and ranged from 0% to 96%. Relative fecundity (eggs/kg), egg size, and egg survival to the eyed stage were similar for each year. Relative fecundity (eggs/mm of total length) declined from 1988 to 1998. Total fecundity was linearly related to fish length in 1998 and in both years combined. Linear relationships between fecundity and female weight followed a similar pattern. No relationships were observed between total or relative fecundity and egg size. Egg size was also not related to total length or weight. An inverse relationship between egg size and egg survival to the eyed stage was only observed in 1998. Egg survival was not related to total length, weight, total fecundity, or either measure of relative fecundity. This information will help fisheries managers make more efficient decisions, particularly in determining the duration of spawning operations at remote spawning facilities.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JUL	2000	62	3					203	211		10.1577/1548-8454(2000)062<0203:RPOIFC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(2000)062<0203:RPOIFC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000088546700007

B.; Okoh, Anthony, I			Determination and ecological risk assessment of two endocrine disruptors from River Buffalo, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												4-tert-Octylphenol (4-tOP) and triclosan (TCS) are endocrine disruptors which have been detected in environmental matrices such as air, soil and water at ultra-low levels. Exposure to endocrine disruptors may account at least in part, for the global increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases like cancers and diabetes and may also lead to an imbalance in the aquatic ecosystem. River Buffalo is an important natural resource in the Eastern Cape of South Africa serving more than half a million people. The presence of the two compounds in the river water hitherto unknown was investigated during winter seasons using solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric techniques. The sampling points differed by some physicochemical parameters. The concentration of 4-tOP ranged 0-755 ng/L, median value 88.1 ng/L while that of TCS ranged 0-1264.2 ng/L and the median value was 82.1 ng/L. Hazard quotient as an index of exposure risk varied according to daphnids > fish > algae for 4-tOP exposure while HQ for TCS exposure was algae > daphnids = fish showing that both compounds were capable of causing imbalance in the aquatic ecosystem.

On phytoplankton growth and loss rates to microzooplankton in the epilimnion and metalimnion of Lake Ontario in mid-summer	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Size-fractionated (20-153 mu m; 2-20 mu m; and 0.2-2 mu m) chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) specific growth and loss rates of phytoplankton size due to microzooplankton grazing were determined in the metalimnion and epilimnion at pelagic hydrographic stations across Like Ontario in July 2008, in addition to rates of growth and grazing of phycoerythrin (PE)-rich picocyanobacterial populations measured using flow cytometry. Eight of the nine stations contained pronounced deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in the metalimnion, which corresponded to the base of the euphotic zone (approximately 17 m). DCM were composed primarily of the Heterokontophyta and Pyrrophyta, and frequently also contained smaller metalimnetic peaks of PE-rich cyanobacteria and Cryptophyta. Specific growth and grazing rates of all plankton size fractions suggested close coupling of growth and grazing rates. Using dilution assays, Chl-a-specific growth and grazing rates (per day; mean +/- standard deviation) for total Chl-a (0.2-153 mu m) were 0.42 +/- 0.30 and 0.53 +/- 0.24, respectively, in the epilimnion and 0.58 +/- 0.74 and 1.03 +/- 0.96 in the metalimnion. Rates for cell specific growth and grazing for PE-picocyanobacteria, the numerically dominant phytoplankton (10(7.1) to 10(8.1) cells/L), were much higher overall with growth exceeding grazing at all stations and depths when measured by both dilution assays and antibiotic assays. The results of this study suggest that the DCM is as active a layer as the epilimnion during the period of summer thermal stratification and should be included in estimates of primary and secondary production.

Changes in soil characteristics and plant species composition along a moisture gradient in a Mediterranean pasture	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Soil physicochemical characteristics, total aboveground biomass, number of species and relative abundance of groups and individual species were measured along a moisture gradient in a pasture, flooded in part during winter through early summer, adjacent to Pamvotis lake in Ioannina, Greece. Soil and vegetation measurements were conducted in 39 quadrats arranged in four zones perpendicular to the moisture gradient. The zone closest to the lake, recently separated from the lake, became part of the pasture and its soil texture was quite different from that of the other zones with a substrate containing 91% sand. Except for pH, this zone had the lowest values in the other five soil physicochemical characteristics measured (organic matter, total and extracted inorganic nitrogen, Olsen extracted phosphorus and extractable potassium); in the other zones organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphor-us and potassium tended to increase from the driest to the wettest zone. Total aboveground biomass, ranging from 280 to 840 g m(-2), is high for herbaceous pastures in the conditions of Mediterranean climate and it was not related to distance from the lake's shoreline, although the highest values were measured at intermediate distances, or to any of the various soil characteristics measured. Also, the number of species/0.25 m(2) was not related to any of the various soil characteristics, but it was highest at the intermediate distances from the lake's shoreline. Species composition varied along the moisture gradient. Forbs as well as annual grasses and legumes declined in abundance from the driest to the wettest places; the reverse was the case for sedges and perennial grasses and legumes. These results indicate that the soil moisture gradient was the principal factor affecting soil characteristics and plant species composition. Since most species were recorded in all the four zones of the pasture, indicating that these can tolerate all variations in abiotic conditions of pasture, the vegetation zonation seems to be influenced by competition. Each functional group of species tends to dominate in a particular range of the soil moisture gradient where it is better suited and tends to exclude competitively other species. Management practices (mowing and grazing) affect the kinds of processes which maintain the observed community structure either by preventing the establishment of later successional species, like reeds and woody species, or by moderating the shoot competition, especially in the wetter zones, and thus permitting the creeping species to grow successfully.

Increasing Water Temperature Triggers Dominance of Small Freshwater Plankton	PLOS ONE												Climate change scenarios predict that lake water temperatures will increase up to 4 degrees C and rainfall events will become more intense and frequent by the end of this century. Concurrently, supply of humic substances from terrestrial runoff is expected to increase, resulting in darker watercolor ("brownification") of aquatic ecosystems. Using a multi-seasonal, low trophic state mesocosm experiment, we investigated how higher water temperature and brownification affect plankton community composition, phenology, and functioning. We tested the hypothesis that higher water temperature (+3 degrees C) and brownification will, a) cause plankton community composition to shift toward small sized phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, and, b) extend the length of the growing season entailing higher phytoplankton production later in the season. We demonstrate that the 3 degrees C increase of water temperature favored the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and small sized autotrophic picophytoplankton cells with significantly higher primary production during warmer fall periods. However, 3X darker water (effect of brownification) caused no significant changes in the plankton community composition or functioning relative to control conditions. Our findings reveal that increased temperature change plankton community structure by favoring smaller sized species proliferation (autotrophic phytoplankton and small size cladocerans), and increase primary productivity and community turnover. Finally, results of this multi-seasonal experiment suggest that warming by 3 degrees C in aquatic ecosystems of low trophic state may cause planktonic food web functioning to become more dominated by fast growing, r-trait species (i.e., small sizes and rapid development).					; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504													1932-6203					OCT 13	2015	10	10							e0140449	10.1371/journal.pone.0140449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140449								26461029					WOS:000362962300097

We tracked the seasonal energy dynamics of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in Lake Michigan during 2002-2004 and compared our findings with previously published results for years 1979-1981. Adult alewife energy density exhibited a pronounced seasonal cycle during both the pre-invasion and post-invasion periods, with energy density in October or November nearly twice as high as that in early summer. However, on average, adult alewife energy density was 23% lower during the post-invasion period compared with the preinvasion period. This significant decline in energy density was attributable to decreased importance of Diporeia in adult alewife diet. In contrast, energy density of juvenile alewives did not significantly differ between the pre-invasion and post-invasion periods. To attain a weight of 8 kg by age 4, bioenergetics modeling indicated that a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Michigan would have to consume 22.1% more alewives during the post-invasion period compared with the pre-invasion period.

J	Karim, A; Dubois, K; Veizer, J				Karim, Ajaz; Dubois, Kristal; Veizer, Jan			Carbon and oxygen dynamics in the Laurentian Great Lakes: Implications for the CO2 flux from terrestrial aquatic systems to the atmosphere	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												We collected samples in lakes Superior, Erie and Huron, including Georgian Bay, in mid-summer during the stratified period to determine the relative importance of production, respiration and atmospheric exchange to carbon dynamics in the lakes. In all lakes sampled, oxygen saturation averaged 107 +/- 2%, significantly greater than the atmospheric equilibrium, and the isotopic composition of dissolved oxygen, delta O-18(DO). averaged 22.8 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand., significantly less than the isotopic composition of dissolved atmospheric oxygen, suggesting that biological production was greater than respiration in the epilimnion during the summer months. While lakes worldwide are commonly oversaturated in carbon dioxide, average pCO(2) in the epilimnion of the lake studied was 342 +/- 42 mu atm and the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon, delta C-13(DIC), was 0.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand, both values not significantly different from expected atmospheric CO2 equilibration (n = 65, p = 0.89, n = 64, p = 0.81). This trend is atypical: approximately ninety percent of lakes globally are oversaturated in carbon dioxide. The atmospheric equilibrium observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other studies suggest that pCO(2) in large lakes is depleted relative to smaller lakes. This is also the case for rivers that are sourced from or flow though large lakes and they can be expected to have lower pCO(2) downstream from the lakes and lower per unit area carbon fluxes than other rivers. An improved understanding of the global carbon cycle mandates that this be taken into account when considering CO2 fluxes from aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main goal of the study was to elaborate a complex assessment of the geodiversity the central part of this valley, using the multi-criterial, bonitation-parametric method. The following elements of abiotic environment were analysed: morphology, geological setting and waters. The relief analyse was made by describing types of natural landscape; morphologic landform, variability of relative heights and anthropogenic transformations. Presentation of the geology was elaborated with emphasis on lithology, tectonic and volcanogenic structures, presence and possibility of observing active geologic processes. By hydrosphere evaluation: streams; lakes, highland wets, waterfalls, springs, including springs of thermal waters and geysers were analyzed. All geotopes identified during the field work, were assessed and ranked (bonitation). The assessment, involving 3 groups of criteria: scientific values, use values and additional values. Such type complex geotope assessment of the Colca Valley seems to be the first one. Large number of specific criteria allowed to identify the most valuable criteria as well as to provide a wide-ranging assessment of geodiversity. The results of the study show the richness of geodiversity of Colca Valley region connected with its unique landscape values. The region is even more appealing as active geological processes can be observed here easily. Additionally the fame and interest associated with the canyon as well as possibility of watching here the condors, make this region particularly outstanding. The author expresses her hope that the presented results will provide some arguments for the protection of geological heritage of described region, giving the scientific base for future creation here the Colca Canyon Geopark.

J	Klootwijk, C				Klootwijk, Chris			Middle-Late Paleozoic Australia-Asia convergence and tectonic extrusion of Australia	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Recent and new paleomagnetic data from ignimbrite-rich Carboniferous successions of the western Tamworth Belt, Southern New England Orogen, eastern Australia, show a northward excursion over similar to 30 degrees. Paleozoic data from the Australian craton and Tasman Orogenic System (TOS) suggest an Early Devonian start At the middle-late Visean peak, the central New Guinean promontory of the Australian craton reached 30 degrees-40 degrees N, within the latitude range of the western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Devonian-Carboniferous convergence of Australia/northeastern Gondwana with the CAOB, across the Paleoasian-Rheic Ocean, is proposed as a major driver for contemporaneous tectonism throughout Australia and the CAOB. This implies a substantial Variscan, Pangea-forming, influence on Australian Devonian-Carboniferous tectonics - Alice Springs Orogeny (ASO) and Quilpie and Kanimblan Orogenies. Convergence-related compressional deformation of Australia is largely confined to a "compression box", extending southward from the New Guinean promontory and bounded westward by the Lasseter Shear Zone and eastward by the East Australian Rift System. Comparable characteristics of Paleozoic Australia-Asia and Cenozoic India-Asia convergence - north-south compression, weak and heated crust (Larapintine Graben and TOS/Tibetan Plateau), eastern "free oceanic boundary" (Paleopacific/Pacific) - do link Paleozoic Australia-Asia convergence to Cenozoic tectonic extrusion of Tibet Tectonic extrusion of ductile lower crust from the Larapintine Graben led to eastward displacement of the Thomson and Northern New England Orogens, with upper crustal displacement bounded northward by Arunta Block shear zones, the Diamantina River Lineament, the Clarke River Fault Zone and the Townsville Trough, and southward by the Darling River/Cobar-Inglewood Lineaments and Cato Fracture Zone with the Lake Blanche-Olepoloko Fault Zones and Lachlan Transverse Zone as a subsidiary. Recognition of ASO-related tectonic extrusion opens novel, provocative, insights into puzzling aspects of Australian Middle-Late Paleozoic evolution.

A chronology was established based on three AMS C-14 and two OSL dates, and variations in the lithology and grain size, magnetic susceptibility, soil micromorphology, and chemical elements were used to explore the regional depositional environments during the Holocene. The results showed that since around 14 ka BP, this region had experienced seven alternations of wetting and drying. A shallow lake, which was identified by celadon lacustrine sediments with sporadic freshwater gastropod fossils, occurred in this area from around 13.0 ka BP to 9.9 ka BP. There existed two obvious intervals of soil formation, inferred from the environmental proxies of the palaeosol/sandy palaeosol layers, with relatively fine average grain-size, high magnetic susceptibility value, remarkable pedogenesis features, and strong chemical weathering, in particular, a well-developed palaeosol layer dating from the middle Holocene (8.6 ka BP to 4.2 ka BP). A weakly-developed palaeosol layer (from around 1.2 ka BP) at the upper part of the profile is possibly an indication of the Medieval Warm Period. This implies a forest steppe environment at both of these sedimentary stages. After 0.9 ka BP, a desert environment returned, analogous to before around 13.0 +/- 1.4 ka BP, between 9.9 +/- 1.1 ka BP to 8.6 ka BP, and between 4.2 ka BP to 1.6 ka BP, indicating the aggravation of aeolian activity and the expansion of mobile sand dunes. The variations in sedimentary environments were mainly triggered by changes in the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM).

Pollen-based evidence of extreme drought during the last Glacial (32.6-9.0 ka) in coastal southern California	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High resolution pollen analyses of sediment core LEDC10-1 from Lake Elsinore yield the first well-dated, terrestrial record of sub-centennial-scale ecologic change in coastal southern California between similar to 32 and 9 ka. In the Lake Elsinore watershed, the initial, mesic montane conifer forests dominated by Pinus, and Cupressaceae with trace amounts of Abies and Picea were replaced by a sequence of multiple, extended severe mega-droughts between similar to 27.5 and similar to 25.5 ka, in which halophytic and xerophytic herbs and shrubs occupied an ephemeral lake. This prolonged and extended dry interval, which corresponds with warm waters offshore, imply strengthening of the North Pacific High and persistent below-average winter precipitation. The subsequent, contrasting monotonic occurrence of montane conifers reflects little variation in cold, mesic climate until similar to 15 ka. Postglacial development of Quercus woodland and chaparral mark the return to more xeric, warmer conditions at this time. A brief reversal at similar to 13.1-similar to 12.1 ka, as reflected by an expansion of Pinus, is correlative with the Younger Dryas and interrupts development of warm, postglacial climate. Subsequent gradual expansion of xeric vegetation post Younger Dryas denotes the establishment of a winter hydroclimate regime in coastal southern California that is more similar to modern conditions. Pollen-based reconstructions of temperature and precipitation at Lake Elsinore are generally correlative with pollen-based paleoclimatic reconstructions and foraminiferabased sea surface temperatures from Santa Barbara Basin in marine core ODP 893. The conspicuous absence of the similar to 27.5-similar to 25.5 ka glacial "mega-drought" in the Santa Barbara Basin pollen record highlights the sensitivity of Lake Elsinore to hydroclimate change, and thus, the importance of this new record that indicates that mega-drought can occur during the full glacial when climatic boundary conditions and forcings differed substantially from the present.

BP. The comprehensive analyses of multiple alternative indicators indicate that the regional moisture turned from relatively dry to wet after the Late-Glacial period and reached its optimum until the mid-Holocene. However, the trend was punctuated by several decreased humidity phases. Beginning with the severe dry event approximately 4400-4100 cal. BP, the environment was dry as a whole, with modest humidity from approximately 3900 cal. BP. Humidity changes in the study area are dominated by the East Asian monsoon system, which is under the influence of the gradual southward migration of the ITCZ, driven by the summer solar insolation changes in the Northern Hemisphere due to orbital forcing. As the first attempt to apply Rb/Sr value and Ti concentration in tracing moisture evolution in a region with typical subtropical humid climate, this study highlights the different effects and consequences of the proxies throughout the palaeoenvironmental change process, and the impacts of regional topography that sustained tectonic subsidence since the Cretaceous as well as the southeast tilt that opened the plain to the summer monsoon. Moreover, the fluctuation of magnetic susceptibility is associated with the granularity feature, the reduction-oxidation conditions, and the impact of human factors on the natural sedimentary environments during the historic period in the Jianghan Plain.

Summer Habitat Use by Lake Sturgeon in Manistee Lake, Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens is targeted for rehabilitation across its range, but little is known about habitat use by Lake Sturgeon during periods other than the spawning period. Insight into habitat use during nonspawning periods for these long-lived fish is crucial to our understanding of this species and its recovery. Our goal was to characterize summer habitat use by Lake Sturgeon in Manistee Lake, Michigan, a drowned river mouth complex. Fish were tagged and relocated in the lake by using telemetry in 2003-2005. The lake was divided into 18 sampling sections, and abiotic and biotic variables with potential influences on habitat use were quantified in each section during May-July in 2003 and 2004. Lake Sturgeon were found in the lake during May-July and primarily occupied habitats near the wetland complex and shipping channel in the northern portion of the lake. Water depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen level, Secchi depth, and densities of chironomid larvae, dreissenid mussels, burrowing mayflies Hexagenia spp., and amphipods differed among sampling sections. Similarities between Lake Sturgeon relocation sites and the sampling sections were analyzed with Penrose distance statistics. Abiotic and biotic variables in the southern and central portions of the lake were most similar to those at sampling sections where Lake Sturgeon were relocated. The difference between southern and central sampling sections and the sections where fish were relocated suggests that habitat use was influenced by additional factors that were not monitored. Future efforts to conserve Lake Sturgeon populations should include habitat management during nonspawning periods.

Therefore, any factor modulating animal behavior (e.g. physiology and individual preferences in habitat choice) has the potential to influence ecosystem functioning. By using a small temperate lake as a model system, we investigated habitat selection in brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis to understand how thermal constraints determine its spatial overlap with zooplankton prey. More specifically, we tested that 1) fish will track zooplankton-rich areas as long as the resource is in a suitable habitat (e.g. depth, temperature), 2) the magnitude of fish-zooplankton spatial overlap will depend on seasonal variations in the permeability of the thermal barrier, and 3) fish individual variability will modulate the selection of resources (i.e. zooplankton) and/or habitat (e.g. epilimnetic zone). Zooplankton was mapped weekly with an underwater vision profiler to interpolate their 3D distribution in the entire lake over 11 weeks, whereas acoustic tags tracked the movements of 21 fish during the same period at 10-14 s intervals. We found that fish mostly selected offshore benthic metalimnetic habitats during summer with some individuals selecting zooplankton-rich areas. When the thermal barrier disappeared, at the end of the summer, most fish shifted from offshore to littoral areas with an increased selectivity of zooplankton-rich areas, although some individuals never selected them. Our study demonstrated how habitat selection could seasonally fluctuate according to thermal habitat fragmentation, preventing a top predator from accessing specific habitats. By integrating individual differences in habitat or resource selection, our results help to improve our understanding of mechanisms of habitat selection by stenothermic predators with thermal constraints and also raise questions about the potential effects of climate change on temperate lakes that were only colonized by these fish.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				JUL	2025	2025	7								10.1111/oik.10528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.10528		APR 2025											WOS:001457646100001
J	Pleskot, K; Zolitschka, B				Pleskot, Krzysztof; Zolitschka, Bernd			Is the 'Year Without a Summer' imprinted in continental varve thickness records?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The 1816 CE Year Without a Summer (YWS), following the 1815 CE Tambora eruption, is a classic example of a global cooling event caused by a volcanic eruption. It is well-documented in various historical sources and natural archives. In this study, we investigate whether imprints of this event can be detected in time series of varve and varve sublayer thickness (VT) derived from lake archives. To this end, we examine 43 published and globally distributed VT records covering the period 1766-1866 CE. We hypothesize that thickness anomalies in many VT records correspond to the YWS because it was one of the most prominent climatic events of recent centuries, and VT is a sensitive climate recorder. We evaluate site-specific temperature and precipitation anomalies for the YWS of each investigated lake using available climate model simulations that incorporate proxy and observational data. VT anomalies are identified based on individually selected threshold values for each record, following a robust estimation of trend and variability in the VT data. The climate variables and seasons most influential to VT are determined for each lake based on the related original publications. Our analysis documents that only five records reveal VT anomalies attributable to the YWS. The relationship between VT anomalies and the YWS is questionable in seven records, primarily due to uncertainty about the climatic influence on VT in these cases, and unlikely for the remaining 31 records. The 31 records lacking a YWS signature are divided into two groups. In the first group, the absence of VT anomalies is likely due to weak climate forcing, as temperature and precipitation changed only slightly at those locations. In the second group, while climate forcing was significant, the season during which the anomaly occurred or the specific climate variable that deviated from the long-term mean were not the primary drivers of VT identified in the original studies. We conclude that VT anomalies due to annual climate events are only recorded if a combination of favorable conditions coincides.

Planning for the future, algae bloom dynamics in water management and ecosystem restoration efforts	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Eutrophication and chronic harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a challenge for ecosystem managers and restoration planners. Drivers of HABs include nutrient availability, temperature patterns, atmospheric conditions, rainfall-runoff relationships, and lake hydrodynamics. In South Florida, water is managed by water control plans that leverage restoration and water management infrastructure to control water levels in Lake Okeechobee and downstream systems. This study evaluated factors that contribute to algal blooms within Lake Okeechobee, assessed the long-term trends in algal biomass, and developed a modeling tool to evaluate lake algal bloom risk in the context of restoration and water management planning. For this study, Lake Okeechobee was divided into five distinct ecological zones based on physical (i.e., bathymetric), chemical (i.e., nutrient concentrations), and ecological (i.e., littoral, shallow, and open water zones) characteristics. Long-term changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations were interrelated with lake stage, volume, residence time, nitrogen, phosphorus, and temperature. Algal biomass, as indicated by concentrations of chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin, was significantly influenced by stage elevation, season, and location within the lake. Given the spatially unique characteristics of the lake and the potential drivers of algal blooms, two separate models were developed to evaluate scenarios. The first was an updated and expanded stage-based algal bloom indicator model used in prior restoration planning efforts. This model demonstrated the sensitivity of average summer chlorophyll-a concentration and bloom frequency across the lake, with littoral south, littoral west, and nearshore zones being the most responsive to changes in stage. The second model was a hierarchical model that used hydrodynamic and biogeochemical variables to predict chlorophyll-a concentrations across the lake. This model enhanced the understanding of summer chlorophyll-a concentrations across ecological zones. Moreover, these models both demonstrated how changes in water management regimes and restoration infrastructure can improve ecological conditions and significantly shift algal bloom potential for the lake. These models are valuable tools for understanding algal bloom potential and can be incorporated as a performance measure to evaluate future restoration planning efforts.

Knowledge of the Holocene climatic evolution of the Mu Us Sandy Land in North China is important for understanding the cultural development of northern Shaanxi. However, few continuous and high-resolution lake sedimentary records are available from the region. We selected Lake Gouchi, a climatically sensitive site in the Mu Us Sandy Land, for a study of sedimentary organic indicators such as n-alkanes, with the objective of reconstructing the regional climatic history since the mid-Holocene. Our results indicate that during 8130-4500 BP, the regional climate was relatively warm and humid, the terrestrial vegetation was dominated by woody plants, and the nutrient level of the lake was relatively stable. Then the climate gradually became arid. However, at the beginning of 2500 BP, there was an 800-year period of warm and humid conditions. Entering the historical period there was an increase in the environmental impacts of human activities. Overall, the climate of the Gouchi area was influenced by the response of the East Asian summer monsoon to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, which were responsible for the mid-Holocene Maximum. Comparison of the climatic record of Lake Gouchi with the sequence of cultural evolution in northern Shaanxi reveals a distinct relationship. Favorable climatic conditions were associated with technological development, an increasing population, and a flourishing civilization; whereas less favorable climatic conditions were associated with cultural stagnation or decline.					; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Youliang, Huang/HJG-7075-2022; YANG, RUI/M-3263-2019	Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Lin, Chen/0000-0001-6325-6677; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				OCT	2023	47	5					721	740		10.1177/03091333231159007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03091333231159007		MAR 2023											WOS:000945565000001
J	Yonebayashi, C				Yonebayashi, Chuh			Changes in vegetation, climate and snowfall regime since the late Pleistocene in a snowy mountainous region of central Japan	HOLOCENE												Although the most crucial factor shaping vegetation history is temperature, snowfall regime is also important in regions of heavy snow. Pollen analysis in a mire in a snowy mountainous region of central Japan revealed histories of vegetation and precipitation regimes since the latest Pleistocene. The abundance of pinaceous pollen during the latest Pleistocene indicates a subalpine regional coniferous forest and cooler conditions; moreover, sandy sediment and significant occurrence of pollen from Artemisia along with several alpine elements suggest local plant communities of poor vegetation cover in an erosive environment. The increase in Betula and Quercus subgen. Lepidobalanus pollen and the decline in pinaceous pollen in 13,550 cal. yr BP indicates climatic amelioration favourable to temperate trees, and the invasion of sedges and Reynoutria to the small basin and the onset of peat deposition suggest an increase in summer rain. The increase in Fagus crenata pollen after 11,130 cal. yr BP and onwards indicates that the present heavy snowfall regime induced by inflow of the Tsushima Current has been established since that age. The climatic amelioration delayed establishment of the heavy snowfall regime for more than 2400 years. In addition, the retreat of sedges and subsequent invasion of several species of drier habitat after 11,130 cal. yr BP indicate a drier mire condition caused by increased summer temperatures. The recovery of sedges after 3740 cal. yr BP indicates the wettest mire conditions induced by climatic deterioration. A general increasing tendency of conifers in this period supports this interpretation.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2019	29	1					77	84		10.1177/0959683618804644	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618804644													WOS:000454992800006

J	Stang, SA; Strickland, A; Allen, M				Stang, Stephen A.; Strickland, Andy; Allen, Micheal			A sport fish on the brink: Striped Bass in the Ochlockonee River drainage, Florida	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Lake Talquin and its tailrace located below the Jackson Bluff Dam provide a popular Striped Bass Morone saxatilis fishery in the Florida panhandle. The system also serves as an important broodfish repository for hatchery programs participating in Striped Bass restoration efforts throughout their Gulf of Mexico range. In recent years, larger Striped Bass required for spawning purposes have become increasingly rare. We sought to understand the underlying causes behind the reduction of larger size-classes.Methods Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations of creeks used as thermal refuge in Lake Talquin were measured during the summer of 2020 to evaluate summer habitat quality. A total of 201 Striped Bass were tagged with high-dollar-reward dart tags in Lake Talquin and below the Jackson Bluff Dam from December 2020 to February 2021 to investigate angling exploitation. An age sample was collected from December 2021 to January 2022 to examine population structure.Results Marginal thermal and dissolved oxygen refuge exists for adult Striped Bass in Lake Talquin, and this refuge appears to be transitory in space and time. Annual exploitation was 25%, and there was evidence of substantial population connectivity between Lake Talquin and the lower Ochlockonee River via dam escapement. Exploitation was focused below the dam and limited to two cohorts of fish, and the harvest rate was greater for fish of larger sizes. The age sample showed that Striped Bass in Lake Talquin appear to be growing rapidly until age 3 before experiencing high levels of mortality.Conclusions Marginal summer habitat is likely contributing to high levels of natural mortality and the reduction of larger size-classes. The truncated age structure is likely to degrade further if conditions worsen. This directed research indicated that changes in the management strategies were warranted to conserve this population in the wake of a changing climate. Impacts from a changing climate pose threats for a population of Striped Bass that are critical for the conservation of this species throughout their existing Gulf of Mexico range. As a result, changes in management strategies for this fishery are warranted.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2025	45	1					117	126		10.1093/najfmt/vqae001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqae001		MAR 2025											WOS:001446404600001

The investigation on the origin of deep K-rich confined brine and the variations in K-Mg elements corresponding to the evolution in MH shed light on the significance of assessment and utilization of brine deposits. This study presents multiple isotopes (delta 18O-delta D, 87Sr/86Sr) and hydrochemical characteristics for various waters (including river water, surface brine, intercrystalline brine, confined brine and anticlinal brine) in the MH. Our findings corroborate that: (1) confined brine exhibits relatively high K+ (average value of 6.88 g/L) and low Ca2+-Sr2+ concentrations, compared to anticlinal brine, and its chemical composition resembles the evolution of Yuqia River in Ca-SO4-HCO3 diagram, suggesting that contemporary river water is the primary source of confined brine. (2) The delta 18O-delta D values of confined brine in MH ranged from - 17.80 to - 27.40 parts per thousand and 1.50 to 2.40 parts per thousand, respectively, and fall on the right field of the local evaporation line, indicating successive evaporation and concentration processes. (3) The 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.71142-0.71145) of confined brine fall between river water (0.71150-0.71183) and anticlinal brine (0.71135), combining with river water and confined brine which exhibit low Sr content, and further confirming the origin of confined brine is a mixture by river and anticlinal brine and much river recharge budget. (4) Considering the evolution of sedimentary facies (Dezongmahai Lake area as an example) and the gradual increase in K and Mg contents in MH, the enrichment of K and Mg exhibits a certain correlation with the evolution of MH. Notably, the brine in the northeast of the basin displays the highest levels of K and Mg, indicating that this region serves as the ultimate depositional center.																			1380-6165	1573-1421				SEP	2024	30	3			SI		239	258		10.1007/s10498-024-09424-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-024-09424-9		APR 2024											WOS:001205958500001

This study examines daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2001 and 2015 over northwestern Iran, which encompasses LU. Intriguingly, salt emissions from the LU surface associated with ongoing desiccation do not drive the study region's AOD profile, whereas pollution transported from other regions and emissions around LU are more important. Signatures of increasing local crustal emissions are most evident outside of the peak dust season (January, February, and October) and on the periphery of LU. AOD has generally increased in the latter half of the study period with the onset of the AOD ramp-up starting a month earlier in the spring season when comparing 2009-2015 versus earlier years. Results indicate that suppression of emissions on the LU border is critical as the combined area of salt and salty soil bodies around LU have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past two decades, and disturbing these areas via activities such as grazing and salt harvesting on the lake surface can have more detrimental impacts on regional pollution as compared to benefits. These results have important implications for public health, climate, the hydrological cycle, and pollution control efforts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A Record of Humidity Changes in Sections of a Valley Peatbog in the Southern Part of the Far East	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												Comprehensive study of sections of mares in the Bolshaya Ussurka River basin has allowed highlighting climate changes over the past 2900 years. Reconstructions are based on the data of botanical, diatom, and palynological analyses and radiocarbon dating. The moisture content changed most significantly. Periods of prolonged droughts, which coincided with the weakening of the summer monsoon, were established. A long dry period continued from about 2900 up to 1360 yr BP. Dry conditions did not exclude floods caused by heavy rain caused by the passage of typhoons or deep cyclones. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were humid and characterized by increased cyclogenesis. There were short-term fluctuations in humidity: droughts about 530-460 yr BP ago, then conditions became more humid about 400 yr BP and especially about 330-260 yr BP ago. The age ranges of periods with different flood activity and paleo-fires were determined. Events were correlated with data on regional and global events. A different response of mountain and bog landscapes to short-period climatic changes has been established. The role of the Korean pine in forest vegetation changed significantly; its distribution is controlled by changes in the hydroclimatic conditions. The optimum environments for the development of Korean pine forests were 780-530 yr BP ago. The role of Korean pine decreased during dry phases and after fires. The most variable vegetation of the mares was during the Little Ice Age. Modern anthropogenic changes in landscapes are also recorded in the sections.

The 15 elements analyzed were Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Ni, Rb, Sb, Se, Th, U and Zn. Highest concentrations occurred in plants collected near the mouth of the Saginaw River [USA]. The alga, Cladophora sp., and cat-tail (Typha angustifolia) had high heavy metal concentrations. Species sampled from wilderness areas in Michigan''s upper peninsula [USA] contained higher concentrations of certain metals than any sample from Saginaw Bay.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1980	9	2					185	193		10.1016/0304-3770(80)90020-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(80)90020-0													WOS:A1980KQ97900009

Evidence from field studies of urban lakes in two humid subtropical cities	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT												Blue infrastructure is considered a nature-based solution to address urban heat problems. However, the potential nocturnal urban heat island (UHI) effect of water bodies has not been investigated and elaborated thoroughly. Besides, existing studies have primarily focused on surface temperature and are limited to individual cities during summer daytime. In this study, screen-height air temperature/humidity measurements at lake, residential, and rural sites in two humid subtropical cities of China (Nanjing, Guangzhou) were conducted continuously for one year. The UHI intensity (UHII), urban moisture island intensity (UMII, evaluated by humidity ratio difference), and heat index (HI) were analyzed across different weather conditions and time scales. Results demonstrated that (1) compared to residential sites, urban lakes can help mitigate urban heat excess, while this capability at night is not as significant as during daytime; compared to rural sites, urban lakes exhibit diurnal thermal behavior of daytime cooling and nighttime warming, with a weak urban cool island intensity (UCII) of 0.1-0.6 C-degrees during the day but a significant UHII of 1.2-1.3 C-degrees at night during warm months (May-September), which is comparable to residential sites with UHII of 1.1-1.3 C-degrees; (2) urban moisture excess tends to occur during nighttime and cold seasons; (3) compared to rural sites, lakes contribute to a good relief on heat stress during daytime, but a significant negative effect at night due to the intensified warming and humidifying. Findings of this study can provide empirical evidence to help better understand the effectiveness of water bodies for urban heat mitigation.					; Sailor, David/E-6308-2014; Yao, Lingye/HGB-9949-2022; Xu, Genyu/HPE-0540-2023	Yang, Xiaoshan/0000-0001-7633-2982; Sailor, David/0000-0003-1720-8214; Yao, Lingye/0000-0003-3588-8225; Xu, Genyu/0000-0002-4761-0688													0360-1323	1873-684X				NOV 1	2023	245								110860	10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110860		SEP 2023											WOS:001086694500001

Intralake Heterogeneity of Thermal Responses to Climate Change: A Study of Large Northern Hemisphere Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) measurements from various sources illustrate that lakes are warming in response to climate change. Most previous studies of geographical distributions of lake warming have tended to utilize data with limited spatial resolution of LSWTs, including single-point time series. Spatially resolved LSWT time series are now available from satellite observations, and some studies have investigated previously the intralake warming patterns in specific lakes (e.g., North American Great Lakes). However, across-lake comparisons of intralake warming differences have not yet been investigated at a large, across-continental scale, thus limiting our understanding of how intralake warming patterns differ more broadly. In this study, we analyze up to 20years of satellite data from 19 lakes situated across the Northern Hemisphere, to investigate how LSWT changes vary across different lake surfaces. We find considerable intralake variability in warming trends across many lakes. The deepest areas of large lakes are characterized by a later onset of thermal stratification, a shorter stratified warming season and exhibit longer correlation timescales of LSWT anomalies. We show that deep areas of large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere as a result tend to display higher rates of warming of summer LSWT, arising from a greater temporal persistence in deep areas of the temperature anomalies associated with an earlier onset of thermal stratification. Utilization of single-point LSWT trends to represent changes in large lakes therefore suppresses important aspects of lake responses to climate change, whereas spatially resolved LSWT measurements can be exploited to provide more comprehensive understanding.

J	NALDRETT, DL				NALDRETT, DL			LOCOMOTION AND FEEDING TRACES IN CHAMPLAIN SEA SUBAQUEOUS OUTWASH DEPOSITS NEAR OTTAWA, CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Locomotion and feeding traces (repichnia and fodichnia) observed on bedding planes of rhythmically bedded subaqueous outwash deposits in the Brazeau sand pit, Nepean, Ontario, Canada, are the first bedding-plane traces described in detail from the western Champlain Sea. The Planolites-Palaeophycus-like and Taenidium-like traces are cylindrical with circular cross section, smooth sided, unlined, sinous, sometimes branching, and sometimes meniscate. Organisms producing the traces are tentatively identified as errant polychaetes or nemerteans. The enclosing sediments are rhythmic couplets of alternating fine sand and silt layers overlain by silty clay and fine-medium silt layers. The occurrence of traces within the uppermost portion of the coarse unit, and within the coarser, upper portion of the overlying fine unit, and the rhythmic alternation of coarse and fine layers suggest these deposits may be varves. The traces formed during the more biologically suitable summer months but were preserved only during the latter portion of the summer. Traces are distributed on bedding planes in close association with bedforms and show a high correlation with the substrate and possibly the hydrodynamic regime. This is interpreted as indicating a strong preference in feeding behaviour. The presence of traces in the subaqueous outwash environment necessitates rethinking of the depositional environment to include the presence of errant polychaetes, nemerteans or similar organisms, and the lower life-forms such as epontic algae and bacteria on which they live.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				NOV	1990	27	11					1495	1503		10.1139/e90-159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e90-159													WOS:A1990EW18000010

Fourteen PAHs were studied, and their total concentrations varied from 616.6 to 3486.7 ng/L in dissolved phase and from 403.8 to 3125.5 ng/L in particulate phase. The estimated deposition loading of PAHs was 3568 mu g/m(2) during the monitoring period. The deposition of PAHs was a potential source for Pearl River comparing with the contents of surface water. In addition, the high concentration in precipitation here implied that PAHs pollution was a potential environmental problem in Guangzhou. Most precipitation concentrations of PAHs in March (the last month in winter in Guangzhou) were higher than in the other months (in rainy season). PAHs inclined to be adsorbed to particulate phase with the increase of molecular weight in rainwater. Combustion of fossil fuel and biomass might be the major source of PAHs, while the direct leakage or volatilization from petroleum products might be insignificant.

In the mesocosm experiment, gizzard shad growth and survival were negatively correlated with gizzard shad density and positively correlated with macrozooplankton prey. Bluegill growth was positively correlated with prey availability, but survival was uniformly high despite differences in zooplankton abundance and fish density. Macrozooplankton and copepod biomasses were negatively correlated with fish density. In Lake Shelbyville, co-occurrence of larval gizzard shad and bluegills in the limnetic zone was limited to a 3-week period, and the period of greatest larval gizzard shad abundance preceded the appearance of bluegills. Zooplankton abundance declined greatly after the peak in larval gizzard shad abundance and remained low when bluegills were present. Growth rates of gizzard shad were highest early and declined throughout the summer, whereas bluegill growth was highest during mid to late summer. Growth rates of gizzard shad and bluegills in the field were not correlated with fish density. However, as in the mesocosm experiment, zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with fish density, bluegill growth was correlated with the abundance of zooplankton prey, and bluegill survival was uniform through time and not related to fish density or zooplankton abundance. Diet overlap was substantial; gizzard shad and bluegills fed selectively on smaller prey items in June, switching to larger cladocerans and copepods by July. Our results suggest that growth and survival of planktivorous larval gizzard shad and growth of larval bluegills are affected by availability of zooplankton prey, which may become limiting when larval fish densities are high.																			0002-8487					SEP	1994	123	5					703	717		10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0703:GASOLF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0703:GASOLF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PH63700002

In this paper, we compile 593 absolute ages of 87 aeolian sand-paleosol profiles from the Hulun Buir (HB), Otindag (OD) and Qinghai Lake (QH) dune field of central China to more accurately understand paleosol development across this region. In addition, paleoclimatic records from Hulun Lake, Dali Lake and Qinghai Lake from within the dune field are quantitatively analyzed to understand the main drivers of paleosol development. Results show that effective moisture was the pacemaker of paleosol development in the OD dune field with peak deveiopment of paleosols in the mid-Holocene (8-3.5 ka). The HB dune field also extensively developed paleosols during the mid-Holocene optimum (9-4 ka), corresponding to strong effective moisture and high lake-level in the Hulun Lake record. Paleosols were widely developed in the QH dune field during the middle to Late Holocene (6-1 ka), which was not correlated with the precipitation and temperature records of the Qinghai Lake alone, but was in phase with the effective moisture records (i.e., high lake-level and Thaumarchaeol content). These results confirm that effective moisture is the main forcing mechanism of paleosol development at the edge of the EASM region. This explains the delay of the mid-Holocene optimum compared to the early Holocene insolation peak, because the increased evaporation caused by the increase in insolation and temperature in the early Holocene may have been sufficient to reduce the effective moisture, resulting in increased regional aeolian activity and dust availability. We also suggest that the correlation between magnetic susceptibility and precipitation in the dune fields in northern China is not a simple linear relationship, but a potential proxy for regional effective moisture. This study is important for understanding the mechanism of paleosol development and related climate dynamic feedbacks in arid and semiarid regions, as well as for combating land desertification.					齐, 昊东/JHS-3644-2023; Wu, Peng/GVU-4549-2022; Sun, Lei/HNQ-1900-2023														0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 15	2025	676								113137	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113137		JUL 2025											WOS:001573099000001

The objectives of this project were a) to record the anthropogenic activities that caused change in a wetland's ecological character and assess their intensity for each wetland site and b) to identify the most significant environmental impact on each type of Greek wetland. Nineteen factors of degradation (intensive human activities) were identified and grouped in one of the impact categories according to their most significant direct impact. These degradation factors were grouped into four categories for impact evaluation: change in water regime, depletion of wetland resources, change in water quality, and loss of wetland area. To inventory anthropogenic activities and their possible impact on the ecological character of Greek wetlands, more than 1200 questionnaires were distributed, selected, and processed to compile information. These data for 291 wetlands were compiled into a data base GRIN (GReek INventory) that provides information on the factors of degradation of different kinds of wetlands (deltas, estuaries, lagoons, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, marshes, and springs). The following factors most frequently impacted Greek wetlands: a) construction of irrigation schemes and diversion of water courses, causing changes in water regime (12%); b) overpumping, land clearing, and illegal hunting, causing depletion of natural resources (26%); c) agricultural and municipal pollution, causing changes in water quality (54%); and d) establishment of housing facilities and expansion of agriculture, causing loss of wetland area (32%). Change in water regime affected 50% of the springs and 40% of the rivers, natural resources depletion affected 42% of the deltas and 41% of the reservoirs, loss of wetland area affected 60% of the marshes and 52% of the estuaries, while all deltas and 75% of rivers had their water quality impacted.					; Zalidis, Georgios/ABD-9972-2020	Zalidis, George/0000-0001-8078-2601; 													0277-5212					SEP	1997	17	3					339	345		10.1007/BF03161423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161423													WOS:A1997XX56200001

As an example we produce a model for a runoff time series exhibiting pulsatile behavior. This model is a mixture of three autoregressive models which accommodate "rising," "falling," and "normal" states in the runoff process. The mechanism for switching among regimes is given by a three state Markov chain whose transition probabilities are modeled on the basis both of past runoff values and of a time series of rainfall data.

These data indicate that during the early Holocene, when the boreal treeline advanced to the current arctic coastline, conditions in the lower Yenisey River region were moist compared to the present, whereas greater aridity prevailed to the east near the lower Lena River. This longitudinal moisture gradient is consistent with the suggestion that oceanic forcing (increased sea-surface temperatures in the Nordic Seas and reduced sea-ice cover) was a major contributor to the development of a more maritime climate in western Eurasia, in addition to increased summer insolation. East of the Taimyr Peninsula, large tracts of the continental shelf exposed by glacial sea-level drawdown may have suppressed maritime climatic influence in what are now coastal areas, In contrast, during the late Holocene the two regions have apparently experienced coherent shifts in effective moisture. The similarity of the records may primarily reflect reduced North Atlantic influence in the Nordic Seas and southward retreat of coastline in eastern Siberia, coupled with declining summer insolation, (C) 2000 University of Washington.					; Forman, Steven/ABD-7720-2021	Forman, Steven/0000-0002-2080-7915; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				MAY	2000	53	3					319	329		10.1006/qres.2000.2124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/qres.2000.2124													WOS:000087246800006

Over the past six decades, the temperature of the deep water below 300 m has increased by similar to 0.7 degrees C. The warming trend is due mainly to the reduction of cold-water deep convection over this period, which is associated with milder winters in the region. Despite deep-water warming, density stratification was maintained at depths below 100 in. The observed warming trend was interrupted at least twice by abyssal cooling events that were associated with the wettest years on record. We propose that rainfall and cool river inflow are critical factors that control thermal structure and the rate of deep-water recharge in this deep, tropical lake.

Precipitation stable isotopes are useful indices for climate change in the TP. Classical interpretations of variations of precipitation stable isotopes focus on the local surface air temperature or precipitation amount. However, several of the latest studies suggested they may correlate with large-scale modes of variability, such as ENSO. This paper presents a detailed study of ENSO's effect on annual variations of the oxygen stable isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18(p)) at Lhasa in the southern TP for up to 10 years. The stable isotopic composition of water vapor from satellite data [Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)] and simulations from an isotopically enabled atmospheric general circulation model (zoomed LMDZiso) are used to explore the mechanism that leads to variations of delta O-18(p) at Lhasa. Statistically significant correlations delta O-18(p) and ENSO indices [Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and Nino-3.4 sea surface temperature index (Nino-3.4)] are observed. This paper shows that ENSO's effects on the location and intensity of convection over the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the tropical Indian Ocean, along moisture transport paths toward Lhasa, further impact convection from the northern Tibetan Plateau. The changing of this convection results in lower delta O-18(p) at Lhasa in 2007, a La Nina year, and higher delta O-18(p) in 2006, an El Nino year. The study presented here confirms that the regional upstream convection related to ENSO teleconnections plays an important role in variations of delta O-18(p) at the interannual scale and that the more depleted oxygen stable isotopic composition of vapor (delta O-18(v)) from the northwestern region of India during a La Nina year intensifies the lower delta O-18(p) at Lhasa in a La Nina year. The study's results have implications for the interpretation of past variations of archives with precipitation stable isotopes, such as ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems, in this region.

Effect of management on water quality and perception of ecosystem services provided by an urban lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Integrating the perception of water quality in management efforts can be an effective way of developing and evaluating management plans targeted at preserving lake ecosystem benefits. We present a case study of Oswego Lake (OR), an urban lake that has been intensively managed for the past 20 yr to preserve valuable esthetic and recreational benefits. We combined the analysis of a long-term water quality dataset with survey data to assess whether management efforts over time successfully met the expectations of people using the lake. The synergistic impact of both in-lake and watershed management activities significantly reduced whole-lake nutrient concentrations; however, high external phosphorus loading from native soil sources and the surrounding urbanized watershed likely continued to contribute to episodes of cyanobacteria blooms during the summer and partially limited in-lake management efforts. Although there was no statistically significant change in mean summer water transparency over the 20 yr management period, more than 60% of the people that have access to the lake thought the water quality had improved since they started using the lake. The lake was also perceived as "suitable" for esthetic and recreational enjoyment by users. As with other lakes in highly developed urban watersheds, Oswego Lake requires ongoing interventions to maintain adequate water quality. Management challenges include coordination of multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions with sometimes conflicting goals and constituencies, maintaining a long-term monitoring program that can produce consistent high-quality data, and keeping in touch with user groups to ensure that lake water quality meets expectations.					; Sytsma, Mark/B-2746-2013	Costadone, Laura/0000-0002-8143-9466; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 2	2021	37	4					418	430		10.1080/10402381.2021.1970658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.1970658		AUG 2021											WOS:000697401700001

Great Lakes lake sturgeon restoration increasingly relies on hatchery supplementation and stream-side rearing facilities that utilize collections of eggs and off -spring of early life stages. The number of wild-caught eggs/larvae sampled is not likely an accurate pre-dictor of spawning adult number, nor of hatchery cohort diversity. We used microsatellite loci and likelihood-based pedigree reconstruction to quantify offspring diversity, and the number and effective number of adult lake sturgeon contributing to offspring reared in the Manistee River stream-side hatch-ery facility in Michigan. Over 10 years (2005-2014) 1129 samples from stream collections of eggs, dis-persing larvae, and juveniles were genotyped. Inter-annual variation in estimated mean offspring co-ancestry (Theta 0.013-0.030), numbers of contributing adults (N-s 23-72), and effective number of breeding adults ((N) over cap (b) 17-43) were documented. Combining samples across 10 years we estimated that mean off -spring co-ancestry was 0.005, the number of spawning adults (N-s) contributing to offspring released was 326, while the harmonic mean effective number of breeding adults ((N) over cap (b)) was estimated to be 29.5 (lower than 10 times 29.5 for semelparous species). Forty-eight percent of adults contributed one or more offspring in two or more years. Demographic (non-Poisson distribution of adult reproductive success, low (N) over cap (b), relatedness among offspring within and annual N-s and repeated spawning) and genetic (low annual among year cohorts) features depressed levels of diversity. Implications to species recovery planning are discussed considering low numbers of adults recruiting offspring annually. (C) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Chinnaeru River basin is situated 30 km east of Hyderabad City and its area covers 250 km(2) and falls in the Survey of India Toposheet No. 56 K/15. The extensive agricultural, industrial and urbanization activities resulted in the contamination of the aquifer. To study the contamination of groundwater, water samples were collected from an area and analyzed for major cations and anions. Various widely accepted methods such as salinity, sodium absorption ratio, Kelly's ratio, residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, permeability index and water quality index are used to classify groundwater and surface water (tank and stream) for drinking as well as irrigation purposes. Besides this, Piper trilinear diagram, Wilcox diagram, Doneen's classification and Gibb's plot were studied for geochemical controls, and hydrogeochemistry of groundwater and surface water samples were studied.

A single Texas specimen was reported (but not formally described and named) in 2014 from an artesian outflow in Spring Lake, San Marcos, Texas. The Texas specimen provided the first record of Redudasys from outside Brazil. Fifteen specimens were found and studied in 2015 and 2016 from sand pockets among boulders in the Little Nestucca River, near Pacific City, Oregon. Redudasys neotemperatus n.sp. is morphologically and genetically distinguishable from Redudasys fornerise Kisielewski, 1987a, the only formally described species in the genus up until now, and morphologically distinguishable from 'Redudasys sp.'', an unnamed form reported by Garraffoni et al. in 2010 without genetic information. The Texas and Oregon specimens agree well morphologically and genetically.

Infection was apparently confined to a brood of Cyclops hatched in early May and maturing in mid July. The most heavily infected Cyclops were collected in the inshore areas. Inspection of a series of standard tows showed evidence of nonrandom distribution of infection, probably representing a clumping of the cyclopids. Implications of the uneven distribution for establishing infection rates, adequate sampling programs, and survival of the parasite are discussed.																									1965	22	6					1335	+		10.1139/f65-118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f65-118													WOS:A19657175400002

The total counts of bacteria varied over time and space from 1.5 x 10(6) to 1.5 x 10(7) cells ml(-1). The counts of specific bacteria were in the range of 10(3) to 10(4) cells ml(-1) or less; in sum, they generally made up less than 1% of the bacterial community. Some populations showed significant changes in abundance, with blooms lasting 1 to 3 weeks, The rate of change (increase and decrease) in abundance during blooms was estimated to be 0.2 to 0.6 day(-1). The average virus-to-bacteria ratio was 50, and there was a significant correlation between the abundances of virus and bacteria. Both protozoan grazing and lytic virus infection were assessed as possible mechanisms driving the variations in bacterial population density.

Salt Lake City, located on the eastern fringes of Kolkata, despite being a planned township, has failed to manage its water resources in a sustainable way. Results from the study show that the water supplied at the households is hard in nature, saline, and replete with dissolved solids. The problem is further aggravated due to over-extraction of groundwater resources, resulting in an intense fall of the groundwater level in the area.

Nutrients exert a stronger control than climate on recent diatom communities in Esthwaite Water: evidence from monitoring and palaeolimnological records	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A long-term monitoring programme on phytoplankton and physicochemical characteristics of Esthwaite Water (England) that started in 1945 provides a rare opportunity to understand the effects of climate and nutrients on a lake ecosystem. 2. Monitoring records show that the lake experienced nutrient enrichment from the early 1970s, particularly after 1975, associated with inputs from a local sewage treatment plant, resulting in marked increases in concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Climatic variables, such as air temperature (AirT) and rainfall, exhibit high variability with increasing trends after 1975. 3. Diatom analyses of an integrated 210Pb-dated lake sediment core from Esthwaite Water, covering the period from 1945 to 2004, showed that fossil diatoms exhibited distinct compositional change in response to nutrient enrichment. 4. Redundancy analysis (RDA) based on diatom and environmental data sets over the past 60 years showed that the most important variables explaining diatom species composition were winter concentrations of SRP, followed by AirT, independently explaining 22% and 8% of the diatom variance, respectively. 5. Additive models showed that winter SRP was the most important factor controlling the diatom assemblages for the whole monitoring period. AirT had little effect on the diatom assemblages when nutrient levels were low prior to 1975. With the increase in nutrient availability during the eutrophication phase after 1975, climate became more important in regulating the diatom community, although SRP was still the major controlling factor. 6. The relative effects of climate and nutrients on diatom communities vary depending on the timescale. RDA and additive model revealed that climate contributed little to diatom dynamics at an annual or decadal scale. 7. The combination of monitoring and palaeolimnological records employed here offers the opportunity to explore how nutrients and climate have affected a lake ecosystem over a range of timescales. This dual approach can potentially be extended to much longer timescales (e.g. centuries), where long-term, reliable observational records exist.					; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Dong, Xuhui/B-5104-2011	Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2012	57	10					2044	2056		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02670.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02670.x													WOS:000308405300006

However, the variability of the Westerlies in Asia and their relationship to the ASM remain unclear. Here, we present the longest and highest-resolution drill core from Lake Qinghai on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), which uniquely records the variability of both the Westerlies and the ASM since 32 ka, reflecting the interplay of these two systems. These records document the anti-phase relationship of the Westerlies and the ASM for both glacial-interglacial and glacial millennial timescales. During the last glaciation, the influence of the Westerlies dominated; prominent dust-rich intervals, correlated with Heinrich events, reflect intensified Westerlies linked to northern high-latitude climate. During the Holocene, the dominant ASM circulation, punctuated by weak events, indicates linkages of the ASM to orbital forcing, North Atlantic abrupt events, and perhaps solar activity changes.

Results showed that Sigma PAHs concentration in sediment ranged from 796.2 ng/g to 10,470 ng/g with an average of 2,713.8 ng/g. High molecular weight PAHs with 4-5 rings were most prominent in the sediment during all four seasons. Source characterization studies based on the analysis of diagnostic ratio (triangular plot method), cluster analysis, and positive factor matrix analysis suggested that the PAHs of Qinhuai River Basin were mainly from pyrogenic origin (biomass and coal combustion and vehicular emission), and the petroleum source also cannot be ignored (specially in summer). Most individual PAHs occasionally affect the aquatic organisms. The highest benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent doses (BaPeq dose) appear at the sites of sewage discharge and heavy traffic. So, the PAHs pollution sources of urban water body have obvious seasonal-dependent and human activities-dependent characteristics.

Moreover, enhanced monsoonal precipitation has increased runoff and transport of allochthonous material to the lakes. Consequently, water levels are rising, modifying the spatial distribution and composition of local aquatic biota. To infer these environmental and biological changes in recent decades, a 30-cm-long sediment core, representing the past similar to 160 years, from Nam Co, an endorheic lake, was analyzed for subfossil chironomid assemblages and sediment geochemistry. In total, 25 chironomid morphotypes were identified. Nineteen were considered as non-rare taxa (abundances >= 2%) and six as rare taxa (abundances <2%). Since 1956 ce, higher chironomid richness (S = 19) is evident compared to the previous 100 years. The simultaneous decrease in the abundance of profundal Micropsectra radialis-type and increase of both Chironomus and Procladius, taxa adapted to more eurytopic and slightly warmer water bodies, indicate increasing water temperatures and intensified primary productivity. The dominance of littoral chironomid assemblages reflects increasing lake water levels, flooded shorelines and expansion of littoral areas driven by increased precipitation and glacial meltwater input both resulting from the increase in air temperatures. This scenario is confirmed by increases in total nitrogen and Zr/Rb ratios, indicating higher productivity and coarser grain size as a consequence of increased runoff via the Niya Qu. These hydrological changes have resulted in a positive water balance that can be linked to an increase in moisture supply from the Indian summer monsoon and glacier melt, reflecting increasing temperatures and precipitation since 1956 ce, ultimately driven by anthropogenic warming.					; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023; Perez, Liseth/HZI-0811-2023; Zhu, Liping/J-9352-2019; Hoelzmann, Philipp/H-7008-2019	Echeverria-Galindo, Paula Gabriela/0000-0003-0210-4607; Schwarz, Anja/0000-0003-0722-2354; Rigterink, Sonja/0000-0003-2259-5175; Perez, Liseth/0000-0002-5256-3070; Borner, Nicole/0000-0001-8833-6665; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Hoelzmann, Philipp/0000-0001-8709-8474; Massaferro, Julieta/0000-0001-9370-0062													0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2023	38	5					776	789		10.1002/jqs.3517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3517		APR 2023											WOS:000961838000001

Eight additional sites, four in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park/John Muir Wilderness (California) and four in Glacier National Park (Montana), were sampled during the summer of 2000. Attenuation of UV-B was significantly related to DOC concentrations over the three years in Rocky Mountain (R-2 = 0.39, F = 25.71, P < 0.0001) and across all parks in 2000 (R-2 = 0.44, F = 38.25, P < 0.0001). The relatively low R-2 values, however, reflect significant temporal and spatial variability in the specific attenuation per unit DOC. Fluorescence analysis of the fulvic acid DOC fraction (roughly 600-2,000 Daltons) indicated that the source of DOC significantly affected the attenuation of UV-B. Sites in Sequoia-Kings Canyon were characterized by DOC derived primarily from algal sources and showed much deeper UV-B penetration, whereas sites in Glacier and Rocky Mountain contained a mix of algal and terrestrial DOC-dominated sites, with more terrestrially dominated sites characterized by greater UV-B attenuation per unit DOC. In general, site characteristics that promoted the accumulation of terrestrially derived DOC showed greater attenuation of UV-B per unit DOC; however, catchment vegetation and soil characteristics, precipitation, and local hydrology interacted to make it difficult to predict potential exposure from DOC concentrations.

(Crustacea: Branchiura) populations in central Finland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Life history characteristics of a common fish ectoparasite Argulus foliaceus, poorly studied in the northern part of its range, were investigated. Field data on the seasonal occurrence, host preference, sex and size of Argulus foliaceus populations from interconnected lakes in Central Finland were analyzed together with experimental data on egg laying, hatching, and mating behaviour. Demographic characteristics of A. foliaceus from a commercial fish farm thigh host density) with a water supply from the same lake system differed significantly from those of the lake population where the hosts are scarce. Extended periods of egg laying and hatching were documented in the lake population which possibly prevented the appearance of summer peaks in juveniles that were observed in the farm. The elevated activity of the males, which was most clearly observed in their high attachment/detachment rates, is suggested to result in lower survival and growth than in females. The flexibility, in both behaviour and life cycle strategy, allows A. foliaceus to utilize a broad spectrum of habitats of differing host abundance.

It is a catchment river for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP-ER), providing a variety of benefits and ecosystem services, such as flood and drought regulation, fishery and aquaculture, drinking water sources, and biodiversity conservation. In order to objectively reflect the status and changing trend of water environmental quality of the Yihe River, reduce the cost of detection, and improve the efficiency of water quality evaluation, samples were collected at 8 sampling sites in the 220 km main stream of the Yihe River from 2009 to 2019. The spatiotemporal variations of 10 water quality indicators were analyzed, including pH, water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate (NO3-N), fluoride (F-), and sulphate (SO42-). The water quality index (WQI) was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal water quality changes, and the minimum WQI (WQI(min)) model consisting of five key indicators, i.e., NH3-N, BOD5, DO, SO42-,( )and WT, was built by using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated that the water quality indicators in the Yihe River showed significant spatiotemporal variations. With the exception of the COD and TP, the other water quality indicators conformed to the Class I or II standards of China, indicating that the water quality of the Yihe River was better than most natural water bodies. Seasonally, the WQI was better in the autumn and higher in the upstream area compared to the downstream. The water quality remained at the "good" level. The weighted WQI(min) model performed well in evaluating water quality, with coefficient of determination (R-2), mean square error (MSE), and percentage error (PE) values of 0.903, 3.05, and 1.70%, respectively.

Volcanic activity since the eighteenth century, along with the latest volcanic unrest episodes in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, demonstrates that the volcanic system is still active and that future eruptions are likely. Despite its remote location, the South Shetland Islands are an important touristic destination during the austral summer. In addition, they host several research stations and three summer field camps. Deception Island is characterised by a Quaternary caldera system with a post-caldera succession and is considered to be part of an active, dispersed (monogenetic), volcanic field. Historical post-caldera volcanism on Deception Island involves monogenetic small-volume (VEI 2-3) eruptions such forming cones and various types of hydrovolcanic edifices. The scientific stations on the island were destroyed, or severely damaged, during the eruptions in 1967, 1969, and 1970 mainly due to explosive activity triggered by the interaction of rising (or erupting) magma with surface water, shallow groundwater, and ice. We conducted a detailed revision (field petrology and geochemistry) of the historical hydrovolcanic post-caldera eruptions of Deception Island with the aim to understand the dynamics of magma-water interaction, as well as characterise the most likely eruptive scenarios from future eruptions. We specifically focused on the Crimson Hill (estimated age between 1825 and 1829), and Kroner Lake (estimated age between 1829 and 1912) eruptions and 1967, 1969, and 1970 events by describing the eruption mechanisms related to the island's hydrovolcanic activity. Data suggest that the main hazards posed by volcanism on the island are due to fallout, ballistic blocks and bombs, and subordinate, dilute PDCs. In addition, Deception Island can be divided into five areas of expected activity due to magma-water interaction, providing additional data for correct hazard assessment on the island.

J	Méro, TO; Lontay, L; Lengyel, S				Mero, Thomas Oliver; Lontay, Laszlo; Lengyel, Szabolcs			Habitat management varying in space and time: the effects of grazing and fire management on marshland birds	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Freshwater wetlands and marshes with extensive reed beds are important hotspots of biological diversity, but in the absence of proper management, they are subject to biotic homogenisation. We assessed the impact of spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing (for 4 years) and late-summer burning (1 or 3 years before the study) on both songbirds and non-passerines in a previously homogeneous reed bed. We surveyed birds using a combination of line transects and point counts in a quasi-experimental design comprising six treatment levels. Management increased both the diversity of marsh habitats and the diversity of bird species. The species richness and abundance of non-passerines (ducks and geese, wading birds, gulls and terns, rails, coots and grebes) was higher in recently burned than in unburned or old-burned patches. Species richness of farmland songbirds was higher in grazed than in non-grazed patches, and the richness and abundance of reed songbirds was higher in unburned, old-burned, and grazed patches than in recently burned patches. Total Shannon diversity and evenness of birds was lowest in areas with the most intensive treatment (patches grazed and twice-burned), whereas Simpson diversity was highest in these areas. Non-managed patches had fewer species and individuals of all groups except reed songbirds. The proportion of old reed was low in recently burned and grazed patches, and was similarly high in all other treatment areas. No other property of reed stands was influenced by management, and both the allocation and the effect of management were independent of water level. Spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing and late-summer burning may thus simultaneously benefit several groups of birds. The effect of burning alone disappeared in 3 years, even in the presence of grazing; thus it must be repeated every 2-3 years. We conclude that both management actions are necessary to establish and maintain highly diverse habitats for marshland bird communities.

Surface Activity of the Xylophagous Cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus (Dictyoptera: Cryptocercidae) Based on Collections From Pitfall Traps	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Little information is available on the extra-log movement patterns of Cryptocercus punctulatus Scudder (Dictyoptera: Cryptocercidae), despite its key taxonomic position as a member of the xylophagous cockroach family that is sister group to termites. We conducted a field study in which individuals of C. punctulatus were collected from pitfall traps checked daily for 7 mo on the grounds of Mountain Lake Biological Station, VA. In total, 50 large nymphs, subadults, and adults of both sexes were captured, with adult activity strongest from midsummer through autumn. Surface activity seems unrelated to rainfall. The female-to-male sex ratio of trapped cockroaches was 2: 1 overall and 1.5: 1 in adults. Nymphs do not begin exploring outside of natal logs until they are at least half grown and significantly pigmented and sclerotized. Dissections of adult females indicated that more than half captured outside of logs (56%) had sperm in the spermatheca, and one female was carrying a spermatophore. These results suggest that sexual exclusivity cannot be assumed between paired individuals of this species.																			0013-8746	1938-2901				MAR	2011	104	2					364	368		10.1603/AN10133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN10133													WOS:000294062300030

Walleye and Muskellunge Movement in the Manitowish Chain of Lakes, Vilas County, Wisconsin	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We quantified within-year and between-year movement of walleyes Sander vitreus and muskellunge Esox masquinongy in the Manitowish Chain of 10 interconnected lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin. Beginning in May 2004, we marked 7,427 walleyes(55-2,720 fish/lake) and 491 muskellunge (24-99 fish/lake) with T-bar anchor tags and marked 33 walleyes and 36 muskellunge with radio tags. Tags were recaptured and recovered through October 2005 via fyke-netting, electrofishing, angling. and spearing. Anchor tag loss averaged 2.9% for walleyes and 2.1% for Muskellunge. Of 1,752 anchor-tagged walleyes (19-555 fish/lake). 81% (54-90% per lake) were recovered in the same lake in which they, were tagged. Of the 95 muskellunge tagged (1-18 fish/lake), 53% (0-100% per lake) were recovered in the same lake in which they were tagged. For radio-tagged fish, 82% (27 of 33 fish) of walleyes and 50% (18 of 36 fish) of muskellunge were recovered in the same lake in which they were tagged. Of 1,153 anchor tag, returns for walleyes (8-326 fish/tag group and 6-340 fish/lake) and 57 anchor-tag returns for muskellunge (1-17 fish/tag group and 1-12 fish/lake). 76% of walleyes (37-98% per lake) and 45% of muskellunge (0-100% per lake) were found in the same lake in spring 2004 and spring 2005. Our results indicate that most walleyes remained in the same lake during the year of tagging and between years, whereas half of all muskellunge did not remain in the same lake during the tagging year or between),cars. We recommend that walleye angling and spearing fisheries be managed for individual lakes and that muskellunge fisheries he managed for the entire chain of lakes.

Limnological characteristics of the freshwater ecosystems of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, in maritime Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												A limnological survey of 15 lakes and 6 streams was carried out on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) during austral summer 2001-2002. Most of the surface waters had low conductivities (20-105 mu S cm(-1)) and nutrients (total phosphorus 0.01-0.24 mu M), but some coastal lakes were enriched by nutrient inputs from seal colonies and marine inputs. Plankton communities in the lakes contained picocyanobacteria (10(2)- 10(4) stop cells ml(-1)), diatoms, chrysophytes and chlorophytes, and a large fraction of the total biomass was bacterioplankton. Zooplankton communities were dominated by Boeckella poppei and Branchinecta gainii; the benthic cladoceran Macrothrix ciliata was also recorded, for the first time in Antarctica. The chironomids Belgica antarctica and Parochlus steinenii, and the oligochaete Lumbricillus sp., occurred in stream and lake benthos. The phytobenthos included cyanobacterial mats, epilithic diatoms and the aquatic moss Drepanocladus longifolius. These observations underscore the limnological richness of this seasonally ice-free region in maritime Antarctica and its value as a long-term reference site for monitoring environmental change.					; Rochera, Carlos/M-2932-2014; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013; Rico, Eugenio/L-2429-2013; Justel, Ana/A-3955-2010	Toro Velasco, Manuel/0000-0002-4860-7229; Rochera, Carlos/0000-0002-8294-4755; Justel, Ana/0000-0003-3335-0579; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993; Rico, Eugenio/0000-0001-6978-645X; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2007	30	5					635	649		10.1007/s00300-006-0223-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-006-0223-5													WOS:000244753300012

Metals measured were zinc, arsenic, chromium, copper, nickel, and cadmium. All metal concentrations in urban lake sediments were much higher than those in natural lake sediments. Elevated metal levels in urban lake sediments are associated with urban runoff, including street dust polluted by heavy metals. Metals in sediments from urban lakes were extracted with a weak electrolyte solution (0.1 M Ca(NO3)(2)) to predict the toxicity of metals. Among the six heavy metals studied, Cu was the most extractable, followed by Ni and Zn. Ca(NO3)(2)-extractable metal recoveries has a good relationship with metal toxicity based on Chironomus riparius bioassay. This study showed that urban stressors such as vehicle emissions could increase the concentration of heavy metals in urban lake sediments. In addition, there is a positive relationship between sediment toxicity by using C. riparius bioassay and Ca(NO3)(2)-extractability of heavy metals from sediments.

Growth of age-0 through age-3 white crappie was significantly (Pless than or equal to0.05) related to latitude, growing season and surface area. Growth of age-1 through age-5 white crappie also was related to annual precipitation. Multiple linear regression models with precipitation and mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of white crappie as independent variables explained 14-22% of the variation in growth of age-0, -1 and -2 white crappie. By contrast, growth of age-3, -4 and -5 white crappie was unrelated to CPUE. Apparently, between age 2 and 3, the density of white crappie in Texas reservoirs falls below a density-dependent growth threshold beyond which growth is no longer related to density. This density-dependent threshold was most likely related to angler harvest of larger, older white crappie.

After filling is complete, a fall-off in total biomass of fauna is usually accompanied by significant reduction in the proportion of terrestrial detritus in favor of algal food. Newly formed lakes pass through 2 phases. During flooding they are dependent on the terrestrial ecosystem. This is followed by a switch, immediately after filling, to more self-sustained autochthonous-based food chains.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	54	3					215	217		10.1007/BF00014287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014287													WOS:A1977DL18700004

Assessing the Impacts of Climate Change and Water Extraction on Thermal Stratification and Water Quality of a Subtropical Lake Using the GLM-AED Model	WATER												This study combined a catchment model and one-dimensional lake model (GLM-AED) to simulate the response of hydrodynamics and water quality of subtropical Advancetown Lake (South-East Queensland, Australia) to future changing climates from 2040 to 2069 and 2070 to 2099 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 and increased water demand from a 50% increase in population over current levels. The simulation adequately reproduced water temperature (RMSE of 0.6 degrees C), dissolved oxygen (DO) (RMSE of 2 mg/L), and other water quality variables, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Warming temperatures dominated the change in thermal structure and hydrodynamic status of the lake under future climate change conditions. Projected changes in precipitation and hydrological response from the upstream catchment might, however, partly offset the warming temperatures under future climate change. Increased water withdrawal due to population growth, which involved water extraction from the epilimnion, showed antagonistic effects on water stability compared to those from climate change. Under a high emission scenario of RCP8.5 during the 2080s, there is an increased likelihood of winter turnover failure in Advancetown Lake. Nutrient concentrations were simulated to decrease from reduced catchment loads under future climate change conditions. However, Chl-a concentrations were simulated to increase, especially during the period after winter turnover, under these future conditions. The depth of the hypoxia front during stratification is expected to decrease and move towards the water surface, attributable to the warming water temperatures and prolonged thermal stratification, which might affect biogeochemical processes and exchange fluxes between the hypolimnion and bottom sediments. These potential changes may present challenges for water resource management under future conditions of climate change and population growth.

First circumpolar assessment of Arctic freshwater phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity: Spatial patterns and environmental factors	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Arctic freshwaters are facing multiple environmental pressures, including rapid climate change and increasing land-use activities. Freshwater plankton assemblages are expected to reflect the effects of these stressors through shifts in species distributions and changes to biodiversity. These changes may occur rapidly due to the short generation times and high dispersal capabilities of both phyto- and zooplankton. Spatial patterns and contemporary trends in plankton diversity throughout the circumpolar region were assessed using data from more than 300 lakes in the U.S.A. (Alaska), Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to assess spatial patterns of plankton diversity focusing on pelagic communities; (2) to assess dominant component of beta diversity (turnover or nestedness); (3) to identify which environmental factors best explain diversity; and (4) to provide recommendations for future monitoring and assessment of freshwater plankton communities across the Arctic region. Phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton diversity varied substantially across the Arctic and was positively related to summer air temperature. However, for zooplankton, the positive correlation between summer temperature and species numbers decreased with increasing latitude. Taxonomic richness was lower in the high Arctic compared to the sub- and low Arctic for zooplankton but this pattern was less clear for phytoplankton. Fennoscandia and inland regions of Russia represented hotspots for, respectively, phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity, whereas isolated regions had lower taxonomic richness. Ecoregions with high alpha diversity generally also had high beta diversity, and turnover was the most important component of beta diversity in all ecoregions. For both phytoplankton and zooplankton, climatic variables were the most important environmental factors influencing diversity patterns, consistent with previous studies that examined shorter temperature gradients. However, barriers to dispersal may have also played a role in limiting diversity on islands. A better understanding of how diversity patterns are determined by colonisation history, environmental variables, and biotic interactions requires more monitoring data with locations dispersed evenly across the circumpolar Arctic. Furthermore, the importance of turnover in regional diversity patterns indicates that more extensive sampling is required to fully characterise the species pool of Arctic lakes.					; Vrede, Tobias/C-1956-2015; Lento, Jennifer/Y-4082-2019; Kravchuk, Elena/AAO-9679-2020; Novichkova, Anna/Q-2092-2016; Fefilova, Elena/Q-1518-2015; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Shaftel, Rebecca/HNR-3645-2023; Dubovskaya, Olga/S-2163-2016; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014; Kononova, Olga/I-4985-2016	Shaftel, Rebecca/0000-0002-4789-4211; Vrede, Tobias/0000-0001-8235-9890; Schartau, Ann Kristin/0000-0001-6875-6136; Lento, Jennifer/0000-0002-8098-4825; Hayden, Brian/0000-0002-8524-7373; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Novichkova, Anna/0000-0003-1725-451X; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/0000-0002-3324-1017; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2022	67	1			SI		141	158		10.1111/fwb.13783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13783		JUN 2021											WOS:000665109000001

Physical and chemical conditions in the deposits indicate that the endogenous part of sedimentation was about 70% and resulted from significant diatom production. The high sedimentation rate on the bottom was favoured by the funnel morphology of the reservoir, the chronic lack of oxygen in the water column, and the repeated copper sulfate treatment. The former river meanders of the reservoir were the preferential deposit sites.																			0018-8158					SEP 17	1993	268	1					45	55		10.1007/BF00005740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005740													WOS:A1993MC25500004
J	Guo, C; Ma, YZ; Meng, HW				Guo, Chao; Ma, Yuzhen; Meng, Hongwei			Late Holocene vegetation, climate, and lake changes in northern China: Varved evidence from western Loess Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High-resolution archives deepen the understanding of past climate variability. We report new sedimentological and paleoecological data from Chaona Lake in northern China. The record represents the annually laminated (i.e., varved) archive from the western Loess Plateau spanning the Late Holocene, allowing insights into critical time intervals of decadal to centennial-scale climate instability. After developing a robust, continuously chronology supported by radioisotope dating and varve chronology, we used high-resolution palynological and sedimentological data to decipher the specific climate and ecosystem evolution over the last 2800 years. Our results show a general forest decline and climate deterioration intercalated with a series of oscillations during the Late Holocene, which may have profoundly influenced the eco-social development of northern China. In addition, lake development changes that mainly reflect the transformation from deep to shallow lake conditions generally match the regional vegetation, which is probably driven by climate-related processes. However, fluctuations in well or poor and the absence of varved sediment indicate variations in the water circulation in the lake catchment. Periods of predominantly well-varved sediments are considered to reflect reduced lake circulation and more anoxic conditions, coinciding with warmer and more stable climate intervals, such as the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period. Conversely, periods of poor or even non-varved preservation indicate strengthened lake circulation, which may be influenced by strong winds (e.g., 2800-2000 cal yr BP) and cold/drought conditions (e.g., the Little Ice Age). Integration of our data with those of published climatic reconstructions in northern and eastern monsoon China suggests that this variability in climate can be explained by shifts in solar insolation and large-scale ocean-atmospheric coupling dynamics that affect the Loess Plateau (e.g., the East Asia Summer Monsoon and El Nino-Southern Oscillation).

This note reports a floral list of the Lagoon Avendano and its environs, which differ in their levels of anthropization. We compared five sites by measuring composition and specific richness of the vegetation associated to them. The most altered sites, based on the number of introduced species, corresponded to open and recreational areas. Herein, 113 spontaneous species of vascular plants are documented, including 6 Pteridophyta, 77 Dicotyledoneae, and 30 Monocotyledoneae. From these, 13.3% are endemic, 52.2 native, and 34.5% alien species. The most frequently represented families were Poaceae, Asteraceae, Cyperaceae and Scrophulariaceae. The purpose of this catalog was to describe the flora of vascular plant surrounding the body of water of this lagoon which has a large tourist importance for the Commune of Quillon, linking the plant composition with the land uses in its borders.

However, the related result was still scarce due to the lack of detailed geochemical analysis results in the desert sediments. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the geochemical components and parameters of the paleo-aeolian sand dune and modern mobile sand deposits in the Mu Us Desert and discuss the climatic variation inferred from the paleo-aeolian sand dune during the past 4.2 ka BP. The results indicated that (1) geochemical composition of the sandy deposits were dominated by SiO2, Al2O3 and Na2O and the deposits probably originated from the widespread upper continental crust (UCC) and were formed by long-term weathering, transport and re-deposition; (2) these sandy deposits were subjected to weaker weathering or uneven weathering under cold and dry conditions, and had highly similar material sources and degrees of weathering and leaching in general; and (3) the direct OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) dating ages and geochemical parameters from the palaeosol-aeolian sand dune indicated that the regional climate change experienced several typically cold and warm intervals. These intervals are 4.2, 2.8 ka BP and Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period, which probably attributed to periodic variations of the Asian summer monsoonal strength and cold events of the northern Atlantic Ocean in low and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Our results suggest that the development of the sand dune in the Mu Us Desert provided a suitable archive for understanding the past local climatic change, which is linked to the global climatic change.

The formation and dynamics of supraglacial lakes on the Greenland's ice sheet, which appear during the summer melt season, are of particular interest due to their impact on ice dynamics. Detecting these lakes is essential, yet challenging. This paper presents a comprehensive geo-knowledge-informed deep leaning workflow for auto-identification of supraglacial lakes from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The U-Net deep neural network is employed for pixel-level segmentation, distinguishing lakes from other features. Post-processing techniques filter false positives and incorporate geographical knowledge to refine results. The experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method with F1-score of 0.78.

Fossil material occurs in thin, locally reworked dolomitic limestone beds, interpreted as the deposits of very shallow lakes or lagoons, developed on, or adjacent to, a seasonally dry coastal plain. The mostly disarticulated fossils comprise isolated teeth, mandibles, scales, tesserae, dermal bones, lepidotrichia and vertebrae. The fauna includes rhizodonts (cf. Archichthys portlocki, cf. Strepsodus sauroides), lungfish (Sagenodus sp.), other sarcopterygians (Megalichthys sp.), one shark (Ageleodus pectinatus), climatiiform acanthodians and indeterminate actinopterygians. The Mill Hole assemblage is especially noteworthy because it includes some putative juvenile forms (Archichthys and Sagenodus). A critical review of the habitat preferences of the documented taxa suggests that most were either euryhaline or, in the case of Archichthys, probably endemic to brackish or freshwater settings. The Bute fish beds fall within a crucial evolutionary period during which many fish and other animal groups were infiltrating nonmarine environments, either passively or actively. It may be that lakes and lagoons may have functioned as protected nurseries for juveniles during this wave of colonization.

Modelling the progression of these reactions is hindered by our poor understanding of the rates of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions and mineral surface properties in natural systems. This study evaluates the chemical evolution of groundwater flowing through a basalt aquifer, which forms part of the leaking CO2-charged system of the Blackfoot Volcanic Field in south-eastern Idaho, USA. Reaction progress is modelled using changes in groundwater chemistry by inverse mass balance techniques. The CO2-promoted fluid-mineral reactions include the dissolution of primary plagioclase, orthoclase, pyroxene and gypsum which is balanced by the precipitation of secondary albite, calcite, zeolite, kaolinite and silica. Mineral mole transfers and groundwater flow rates estimated from hydraulic head data are used to determine the kinetics of plagioclase and orthoclase feldspar dissolution. Plagioclase surface area measurements were determined using the evolution of the U-series isotope ratios in the groundwater and are compared to published surface area measurements. Calculated rates of dissolution for plagioclase range from 2.4 x 10(-12) to 4.6 x 10(-16) mol/m(2)/s and orthoclase from 2.0 x 10(-13) to 6.8 x 10(-16) mol/m(2)/s respectively. These feldspar reaction rates, correlate with the degree of mineral-fluid disequilibrium and are similar to the dissolution rates for these mineral measured in other natural CO2-charged groundwater systems.

Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Seasonal Distribution of Toxic Cyanobacteria in Western Lake Erie from 2002-2014	TOXINS												Lake Erie, the world's tenth largest freshwater lake by area, has had recurring blooms of toxic cyanobacteria for the past two decades. These blooms pose potential health risks for recreation, and impact the treatment of drinking water. Understanding the timing and distribution of the blooms may aid in planning by local communities and resources managers. Satellite data provides a means of examining spatial patterns of the blooms. Data sets from MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS (2012-2014) were analyzed to evaluate bloom patterns and frequencies. The blooms were identified using previously published algorithms to detect cyanobacteria (~25,000 cells mL(-1)), as well as a variation of these algorithms to account for the saturation of the MODIS ocean color bands. Images were binned into 10-day composites to reduce cloud and mixing artifacts. The 13 years of composites were used to determine frequency of presence of both detectable cyanobacteria and high risk (>100,000 cells mL(-1)) blooms. The bloom season according to the satellite observations falls within June 1 and October 31. Maps show the pattern of development and areas most commonly impacted during all years (with minor and severe blooms). Frequencies during years with just severe blooms (minor bloom years were not included in the analysis) were examined in the same fashion. With the annual forecasts of bloom severity, these frequency maps can provide public water suppliers and health departments with guidance on the timing of potential risk.					; Stumpf, Richard/L-5237-2019	Wynne, Timothy/0000-0001-7282-0866; Stumpf, Richard/0000-0001-5531-6860														2072-6651				MAY	2015	7	5					1649	1663		10.3390/toxins7051649	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins7051649								25985390					WOS:000356240600013

Laboratory analyses of meteoric debris in the upper stratosphere from settling bolide dust clouds	ICARUS												Bolide and fireball fragmentation produce vast amounts of dust that will slowly fall through the stratosphere. DUSTER (Dust in the Upper Stratosphere Tracking Experiment and Retrieval) was designed to intercept the nanometer to micrometer meteoric dust from these events for laboratory analyses while it is still in the upper stratosphere. This effort required extraordinary precautions to avoid particle contamination during collection and in the laboratory. Here we report dust from the upper stratosphere that was collected during two campaigns one in 2008 and another in 2011. We collected and characterized forty five uncontaminated meteoric dust particles. The collected particles are alumina, aluminosilica, plagioclase, fassaite, silica, CaCO3, CaO, extreme F-rich C-O-Ca particles, and oxocarbon particles. These particles are found in friable CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite, and unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteoroids that are the most common source of bolides and fireballs. The oxocarbons have no meteorite counterparts. Some F-bearing CaCO3 particles changed shape when they interacted with the ambient laboratory atmosphere which might indicate their highly unequilibrated state as a result of fragmentation. Equilibrium considerations constrain the thermal regime experienced by the collected particles between similar to 2000 degrees C and similar to 1000 degrees C, as high as 3700 degrees C and as low as similar to 650 degrees C after 9 s, followed by rapid quenching (mu s) to below 1600 degrees C, but equilibrium conditions during these events is most unlikely. So far the observed thermal conditions in these events put the temperatures between similar to 4300 degrees C and similar to 430 degrees C for 5 s and high cooling rates. Such conditions are present in the immediate wake of meteors and fireballs. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Schatz, H; Behan-Pelletier, V				Schatz, Heinrich; Behan-Pelletier, Valerie			Global diversity of oribatids (Oribatida: Acari: Arachnida)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Oribatid mites are primarily terrestrial. Only about 90 species (less than 1% of all known oribatid species) from 10 genera are truly aquatic, with reproduction and all stages of their life cycle living in freshwater. Adaptation to aquatic conditions evolved independently in different taxa. However, many terrestrial species can also be found in aquatic habitats, either as chance stragglers from the surrounding habitats, or from periodic or unpredictable floodings, where they can survive for long periods. In spite of their low species richness aquatic oribatids can be very abundant in different freshwater habitats as in lentic (pools, lakes, water-filled microhabitats) or flowing waters (springs, rivers, streams), mainly on submerged plants. The heavily sclerotized exoskeletons of several species enables subfossil or fossil preservation in lakes or bog sediments.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2008	595						323	328		10.1007/s10750-007-9027-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9027-z													WOS:000252253300036

Lawrence			Climate variations of Central Asia on orbital to millennial timescales	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The extent to which climate variability in Central Asia is causally linked to large-scale changes in the Asian monsoon on varying timescales remains a longstanding question. Here we present precisely dated high-resolution speleothem oxygen-carbon isotope and trace element records of Central Asia's hydroclimate variability from Tonnel'naya cave, Uzbekistan, and Kesang cave, western China. On orbital timescales, the supra-regional climate variance, inferred from our oxygen isotope records, exhibits a precessional rhythm, punctuated by millennial-scale abrupt climate events, suggesting a close coupling with the Asian monsoon. However, the local hydroclimatic variability at both cave sites, inferred from carbon isotope and trace element records, shows climate variations that are distinctly different from their supra-regional modes. Particularly, hydroclimatic changes in both Tonnel'naya and Kesang areas during the Holocene lag behind the supra-regional climate variability by several thousand years. These observations may reconcile the apparent out-of-phase hydroclimatic variability, inferred from the Holocene lake proxy records, between Westerly Central Asia and Monsoon Asia.

Here, we use scale analysis to reconstruct age-specific growth histories of coregonid fish (Coregonus sp.) from Lake Starnberg, Germany, over a 22-year period, evaluating the roles of lake phosphorus concentrations and spring temperatures as potential drivers. Linear mixed-effects models revealed age-specific changes in scale growth over time: while growth remained stable or increased slightly in younger age classes (ages 1 and 2), growth significantly declined over time in mature fish (age 3). During the observed period, phosphorus concentrations decreased, indicating reduced nutrient availability, whereas spring temperatures showed no significant long-term trend. Our analyses further indicated significant interactions between temperature and age class, suggesting that temperature effects on growth may have varied by age, even though there was no overall change in temperature during the monitored time period. The observed decline in growth among mature individuals aligns with predictions from life-history theory, reflecting a potential allocation shift from somatic growth to reproductive investment following maturation. This study provides rare empirical evidence from a natural fish population that long-term environmental changes interact with intrinsic life-history strategies, resulting in clear age-specific patterns of growth variation.

We here hypothesize that MSR can impact the fate of AMD in entire catchments. To test this, we developed a sulfur isotope fractionation and mass-balance method, and applied it at multiple locations in the catchment of an abandoned copper mine (Nautanen, northern Sweden). Results showed that MSR caused considerable, catchment-scale immobilization of sulfur corresponding to a retention of 27 +/- 15% under unfrozen conditions in the summer season, with local values ranging between 13 +/- 10% and 53 +/- 18%. Present evidence of extensive MSR in Nautanen, together with previous evidence of local MSR occurring under many different conditions, suggest that field-scale MSR is most likely important also at other AMD sites, where retention of AMD may be enhanced through nature-based solutions. More generally, the developed isotope fractionation analysis scheme provides a relatively simple tool for quantification of spatio-temporal trends in MSR, answering to the emerging need of pollution control from cumulative anthmpogenic pressures in the landscape, where strategies taking advantage of MSR can provide viable options.

However, the past hydrological changes on the TP induced by interactions between the westerlies and the ISM remain unclear. A sediment core from Lake Zabuye on the southwestern TP was analyzed to reconstruct climatic and hydrological variability over the last 30 kyr. Stable isotopic compositions (delta 13C and delta 18O) of authigenic carbonate act as an indicator of hydrological status for closed-basin lakes on the TP. Four major climatic and hydrological stages were identified: (1) last glacial maximum (29.8-18.9 cal kyr BP), the influence of the westerlies dominated, and a cold-wet climate prevailed; (2) last deglaciation (18.9-11.8 cal kyr BP), the influence of the westerlies receded, and a general trend of decreased wetness was interrupted by two pronounced glacial meltwater events recorded at 17.2 and 15.2 cal kyr BP, respectively; (3) early and middle Holocene (11.8-3.8 cal kyr BP), the Holocene climate optimum was attained and sustained under the dominance of ISM circulation; (4) late Holocene (from 3.8 cal kyr BP to the present), the ISM collapsed during the middle to late Holocene, and a hypersaline lacustrine environment was ultimately formed, as inferred from mirabilite deposition and isotopic signals. Our lake record demonstrates an anti-phase relationships between the westerlies and the ISM on the glacial-interglacial timescale over the southwestern TP. We suggest that both North Atlantic climate and tropical ocean temperature are major drivers of climatic variations on the TP.					; Tian, Lijun/KPB-4331-2024; Zhang, Peixin/KFQ-6229-2024; Zhang, Wenchao/NGS-3352-2025; li, mingming/KXR-5760-2024	Tian, Lijun/0000-0003-3772-2835; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 10	2023	643						22	33		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.10.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.10.015		JAN 2023											WOS:000962971200001

In the summer of 2020, Huayanghe Lake experienced floods. Here, eight cruises were conducted in Huayanghe Lake from 2020 to 2022 to study the response of environmental factors and the zooplankton community to the floods. The results demonstrated that floods increased the concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a. In addition, during the floods, the number of rotifer species increased, while the number of cladoceran and copepod species decreased. Floods also reduced the average density and biomass of zooplankton. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors, such as water depth, water temperature, transparency, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, conductivity, coverage of aquatic vegetation and chlorophyll a, were closely related to the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in Huayanghe Lake. Our research emphasizes that zooplankton can quickly respond to floods, providing data support for the ecological relationship between flooding and the zooplankton community, which is crucial for the preservation and restoration of the lake water ecosystem.

In order to determine the structures of the nontoxic peptides, we collected large amounts of bloom materials from the same lake on July 23, 1991, and isolated three nontoxic peptides. They were named as aeruginopeptins 917S-A, -B, and -C, and their structures were mainly determined by a mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique as 19-membered cyclic depsipeptides possessing the Ahp (3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone) moiety. An analysis of the microcystins and aeruginopeptins in the collected bloom cells and their Microcystis composition suggested that the M. aeruginosa large cell size produces both microcystins and aeruginopeptins, and the production of both compounds is genetically closely related.

Our results revealed that specimens collected from Diaocha Lake in late August were larger and had more nuclei than those collected from the same site in early May. We sequenced their SSU rDNA-ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2-LSU rDNA (5 ' end) and found that they were completely identical, which means that the two populations belonged to the same species. These facts gave us a hint that body dimension and number of nuclei are not reliable taxonomic parameters for opalinids during their life cycle. Therefore, we recommended that the specific identification of opalinids based on morphological features should be carried out during seasons except spring. Meanwhile, our molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed the monophyly of Opalinata. Within Opalinata, Opalinea were monophyletic with all opalinid species grouping together. Karotomorpha and Proteromonas did not group together confirming the paraphyly of Proteromonadea.					; Ponce-Gordo, Francisco/AAL-7138-2020	Ponce-Gordo, Francisco/0000-0001-9034-8606; 													1066-5234	1550-7408				NOV-DEC	2018	65	6					783	791		10.1111/jeu.12520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.12520								29611243					WOS:000451783600003
J	Choi, JH; Jeong, SA; Park, SS				Choi, Jung Hyun; Jeong, Seon-A.; Park, Seok Soon			Longitudinal-vertical hydrodynamic and turbidity simulations for prediction of dam reconstruction effects in Asian monsoon area	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This research investigates possible impacts of enlarged water body according to dam reconstruction on the hydrodynamics and water quality of the reservoir using a laterally averaged, two-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model, CE-QUAL-W2. The lake was formed by the artificial dam in 1983 for agricultural water supply and is currently under consideration of reconstruction so as to expand the volume of reservoir for flood control as well as water supply in downstream areas. To calibrate and validate the model, field-collected data were compared with model predictions for water level fluctuations and water temperature during the years of 2001 ( from January to December) and 2003 ( from March to November). The model results showed a good agreement with field measurements both in calibration and verification. Utilizing the model, impacts of dam reconstruction on the thermal hydrodynamics and turbid current were predicted. From the model results, dam reconstruction limited the depth of thermal stratification below 10 meter and formed steep temperature gradient between epilimnion and hypolimnion. The restricted thermal stratification persisted up to the end of September. This result indicated that thermal stratification would become stronger during summer and stay longer after dam reconstruction. In addition, the restricted thermal stratification caused vertical circulation of water mixing lower than 10 meter and isolated the upper water layer from the lower water layer which increased the volume of hypolimnetic water with low temperature. The vertical circulation near the surface also mitigated propagation of density plume within the depth of 10 m which would remain the hypolimnetic water clean.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2007	43	6					1444	1454		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00120.x													WOS:000251328500007

From these data, we could estimate relative abundances of perch year-classes for the years 1986-1993. During this period, the year-classes of 1988 and possibly 1992 were strong. The year-class 1988 dominated numerically in catches from 1990 to 1993 and the year-class 1992 in 1994 and 1995.

The term HNF, however, describes a functional guild only and, in contrast to the morphologically distinguishable ciliates, does not reflect the phylogenetic diversity of flagellates in aquatic ecosystems. Associating a function with taxonomic affiliation of key flagellate taxa is currently a major task in microbial ecology. We investigated seasonal changes in the HNF and ciliate community composition as well as taxa-specific bacterivory in four hypertrophic freshwater lakes. Taxa-specific catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization probes assigned taxonomic affiliations to 51%-96% (average +/- SD, 75 +/- 14%) of total HNF. Ingestion rates of fluorescently labelled bacteria unveiled that HNF contributed to total protist-induced bacterial mortality rates more (56%) than ciliates (44%). Surprisingly, major HNF bacterivores were aplastidic cryptophytes and their Cry1 lineage, comprising on average 53% and 24% of total HNF abundance and 67% and 21% of total HNF bacterivory respectively. Kinetoplastea were important consumers of bacteria during summer phytoplankton blooms, reaching 38% of total HNF. Katablepharidacea (7.5% of total HNF) comprised mainly omnivores, with changing contributions of bacterivorous and algivorous phylotypes. Our results show that aplastidic cryptophytes, accompanied by small omnivorous ciliate genera Halteria/Pelagohalteria, are the major protistan bacterivores in hypertrophic freshwaters.

Although a series of biological processes within microbial loop are involved in the development of oxygen depletion during the bloom decay, little has been known about the dynamics of microorganisms in response to the decaying process of the bloom through trophic interaction context. Here, we report some preliminary results of our observations about the response of microbial loop to the bloom decay, based on the onboard incubation experiments for 10 days during a diatom bloom near the Yangtze River estuary in August, 2011. Light and dark incubations were conducted to simulate the bloom decay inside and below the euphotic layer, respectively. In the first stage of bloom decay (Day 0 to Day 4), rapid response was found in heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and ciliate growth, which was in accordance with the decrease of total ChI a, indicating a "bottom-up" control at the early stage of bloom decay. However, the increase of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) abundance was rather inconspicuous, suggesting predation pressure on HNF from ciliate or other predator at this stage. In the second stage (Day 4 to Day 8), HB and ciliate decreased rapidly with the increase of HNF, revealing the release of HNF form ciliate predation, which suggested a "top-down" control. In the last stage of our experiment (Day 8 to Day 10), the trophic interactions were more complex, but it also implied a "top-down" control within the microbial loop. Meanwhile, virus had been monitored in the whole process of our incubations. It was found that virus lysed microalgae at the first stage, and lysed HB at the second stage. In addition, the bacterial mortality was principally caused by HNF grazing in the light-sufficient incubations and by viral lysis in the light insufficient incubations. Our results suggest tight trophic interactions within the microbial loop in the decaying process of the algal bloom, which may assist our understanding of the role of microbial loop in hypoxia formation in coastal waters.

Helland and colleagues (2011) test whether this assumption is valid by evaluating whether ice cover affects competition between brown trout [Salmo trutta (L.)] and Arctic charr [Salvelinus alpines (L.)]. They show that increasing ice cover correlates with lower trout biomass when Arctic charr co-occur, but not in charr's absence. In experiments, charr grew better in the cold, dark environments that typify ice-covered lakes. Decreasing ice cover with warmer winters could mean more trout and fewer charr. More generally, their results provide an excellent example, suggesting that species interactions can strongly modify responses to climate change.

The 6 - 9 day wave structure is determined using a composite method. In this structure, there are two vortices of opposite circulation on either side of the latitude 12.5 degreesN. The rainfall maxima are associated with cyclonic vortices and the rainfall minima with anticyclonic vortices, coinciding with the minima and the maxima of geopotential height anomalies, respectively. The composite variability shows that the 6 - 9 day wave is associated with positive rainfall anomalies in West Africa in the band of latitude 7.5degrees - 17.5 degreesN, in the western part of the area around Senegal and Guinea and in the center toward Lake Chad. The rainfall anomalies are linked to the zonal wind anomalies, and the increase in rainfall is associated with large modulation of the African Easterly Jet zonal wind component, mainly in the cyclonic circulation. The main zones of decreasing rainfall appear north of 17.5degrees - 20 degreesN, toward Sudan, and south of 8 degreesN, near Ivory Coast.																			2169-897X					SEP 4	2003	108	D17							4535	10.1029/2002JD003215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003215													WOS:000185361500004
J	Lueddecke, SB; Pinter, N; Gans, P				Lueddecke, SB; Pinter, N; Gans, P			Plio-Pleistocene ash falls, sedimentation, and range-front faulting along the White-Inyo Mountains front, California	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												40Ar/39Ar dating of rhyolitic ashes from the western range front of the White/Inyo Mountains provides some of the first high-precision age controls for the late Pliocene to Pleistocene depositional and tectonic history of the region. Three categories of late Tertiary to recent sedimentary units crop out along the range front: (1) fine-grained basin fill, (2) uplifted and incised fanglomerates, and (3) recent alluvial-fan deposits. Seven ash samples collected from six canyons along the range front and from the basal Bishop Tuff in the Owens Valley fall into three age clusters: 0.757 +/- 0.004 Ma, 2.08 +/- 0.01 Ma, and 2.82 +/- 0.02 Ma. The 0.757 Ma sample correlates with the Bishop Tuff and supports other recent Ar/Ar results that date the tuff at similar to 0.76 Ma. The 2.82 Ma sample comes from a well-known ash horizon within the fanglomerate deposits of Black Canyon, which previous workers had correlated with the Bishop Tuff. Because the fanglomerates overlie lacustrine deposits of the Waucoba embayment, the age of the Waucoba lake beds must be at least 2.82 Ma. Using this new age control, sue develop a model of Plio-Pleistocene tectonic events at the western margin of the Basin and Range province. The abrupt change from lacustrine to fanglomerate deposition at similar to 3 Ma appears to record the birth of the White Mountains fault. The onset of range-front faulting was part of a regional tectonic reorientation, approximately coincident with a shift in tilt polarity, from westward to eastward block tilting, of the White/lnyo Mountains and Owens Valley.																			0022-1376	1537-5269				JUL	1998	106	4					511	522		10.1086/516038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/516038													WOS:000075103600009

Subsequently there have been a few major incursions but none has occurred since 1952. Previous explanations: freezing-over of Hudson Bay, failure of food supplies, and strong onshore winds in the species'' wintering area, are examined in the light of present knowledge about the species'' movements. I conclude that the incursions were genuine irruptions and that their occurrence must have been associated with changes in the distribution or abundance of the species'' prey.

In combination with formerly published geochemical sediment proxies it is shown that during the Late Glacial the steppe was cold, wind speeds were low and available moisture was high. Pollen, diatoms and geochemical parameters record increasing temperatures and decreasing moisture availability resulting in falling lake levels in the steppe culminating in the lowest lake levels around 7640 cat BP. Contemporaneously, Andean Forest established in the mountains and probably wind speeds increased. Between 6000 and 2300 cat BP the pollen record points to cyclic seasonality fluctuations in the steppe and the Andes. After 2300 cat BP the research area became increasingly humid and the Andean Forest underwent changes in floristic composition. Sheep breeders arrived in the 19th century, and in the 20th century conditions in the steppe area became drier.

In this connection there is a supposition that the existing huge Lake Mansi in Late Pleistocene (20-25 kyr BP) on the territory of West-Siberian Lowland could be the reason of the occurrence of powerful mountainous ice-sheets in Siberia. The estimations of this effect have shown that an amount of solid precipitation on the east coast of Lake Mansi (Altay, Sayany) could be more doubled in comparison with the modern amount.

Effect of deep freezing of lakes on food supply in habitats of waterbirds	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The phenomenon of bottom substrate exposure in deeply freezing lakes during the melting of ice in spring is described. It leads to the formation in the lake of a large temporary biotope - a combination of shoals and exposed portions of the silty bed - with a high trophic capacity for ducks, shorebirds, gulls, etc. The lake in such a state is a rich foraging area for nesting and migrating bird populations. This phenomenon, which is widespread in the Central Yakutian plain, is an ecological manifestation of cryoarid conditions developing in the plains due to extreme climate continentality.

J	Pereira, GDR; de Oliveira, EC; Bergamaschi, S				Ramos Pereira, Gustavo do Couto; de Oliveira, Emiliano Castro; Bergamaschi, Sergio			Continental carbonates from Itaborai Formation in southeastern, Brazil	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Since the discovery of the massive South Atlantic hydrocarbon reservoirs (Pre-Salt), the interest in these terrestrial carbonates has increased. In Brazil few examples of continental carbonates are known, and solely the occurrence described in this study can be recognized as continental thermal carbonate or travertine. The occurrence is part of the sedimentary sequence of the Itaborai Formation, deposited in Itaborai Basin, located in Rio de Janeiro state, about 60 km from the city of Rio de Janeiro. The basin dates back to the Paleocene due to its vertebrate fossil content, which can be found in a small half-graben basin (1.5 km x 0.5 km). Despite the small size of the basin, it represents a huge source of geological information for its diverse fossil assemblage, the occurrence of travertine and the exposition of alkaline dyke. Most of the studies regarding the basin are related to the extensive fossil community from the lake-fill facies succession, which are not directly related to the travertine deposition. The present study conducted a sedimentological investigation applying petrography, facies association and isotope analysis as its methodology. As a result, four distinct facies associations were described: Thermal Springs, Alluvial, Palustrine/Lacustrine and Fissural. Sedimentation succession allowed the study to recognize sedimentation and tectonic relationship. The origin of the thermal activity is probably related to the tectonic pulses of the hemi-graben system, so in these conditions two different contexts for travertine deposition associated to the flexural and active borders of the basin were established. The petrography exhibited shrubs textures with remarking crystalline quality indicating a major abiotic influence during the process of precipitation. The stable isotope ratios provided contrasting results against those expected for a thermal carbonate signature, but not so different from those expected for meteoric carbonate signature, indicating a mixture of both processes.

J	Sabin, LD; Lim, JH; Stolzenbach, KD; Schiff, KC				Sabin, LD; Lim, JH; Stolzenbach, KD; Schiff, KC			Contribution of trace metals from atmospheric deposition to stormwater runoff in a small impervious urban catchment	WATER RESEARCH												The contribution of atmospheric deposition to emissions of trace metals in stormwater runoff was investigated by quantifying wet and dry deposition fluxes and stormwater discharges within a small, highly impervious urban catchment in Los Angeles. At the beginning of the dry season in spring 2003, dry deposition measurements of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc were made monthly for I year. Storrawater runoff and wet deposition samples also were collected, and loading estimates of total annual deposition (wet + dry) were compared with annual stormwater loads. Wet deposition contributed 1-10% of the total deposition inside the catchment, indicating the dominance of dry deposition in semi-arid regions such as Los Angeles. Based on the ratio of total deposition to stormwater, atmospheric deposition potentially accounted for as much as 57-100% of the total trace metal loads in stormwater within the study area. Despite potential bias attributable to processes that were not quantified in this study (e.g., resuspension out of the catchment or sequestration within the catchment), these results demonstrate atmospheric deposition represents an important source of trace metals in stormwater to waterbodies near urban centers.

Population characteristics of channel catfish near the northern edge of their distribution: implications for management	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque), populations in six lakes in northern Idaho, USA, were sampled to describe their population characteristics. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, 4864 channel catfish were sampled. Channel catfish populations had low to moderate catch rates, and length structure was dominated by fish <400mm. Channel catfish were in good body condition. All populations were maintained by stocking age-1 or age-2 fish. Growth of fish reared in thermally enriched environments prior to stocking was fast compared to other North American channel catfish populations. After stocking, growth of channel catfish declined rapidly. Once stocked, cold water temperatures, prey resources and (or) genetic capabilities limited growth. Total annual mortality of age 2 and older channel catfish was generally <40%. Tag returns indicated that angler exploitation was low, varying from 0 to 43% among lakes. This research provides insight on factors regulating channel catfish population dynamics and highlights important considerations associated with their ecology and management.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				DEC	2015	22	6					530	538		10.1111/fme.12156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12156													WOS:000365718900008

CASSINI VIMS OBSERVATIONS SHOW ETHANE IS PRESENT IN TITAN'S RAINFALL	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS												Observations obtained over two years by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem suggest that rain showers fall on the surface. Using measurements obtained by the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer, we identify the main component of the rain to be ethane, with methane as an additional component. We observe five or six probable rainfall events, at least one of which follows a brief equatorial cloud appearance, suggesting that frequent rainstorms occur on Titan. The rainfall evaporates, sublimates, or infiltrates on timescales of months, and in some cases it is associated with fluvial features but not with their creation or alteration. Thus, Titan exhibits frequent "gentle rainfall" instead of, or in addition to, more catastrophic events that cut rivers and lay down large fluvial deposits. Freezing rain may also be present, and the standing liquid may exist as puddles interspersed with patches of frost. The extensive dune deposits found in the equatorial regions of Titan imply multi-season arid conditions there, which are consistent with small, but possibly frequent, amounts of rain, in analogy to terrestrial deserts.

J	Richards, G; Moore, RD				Richards, G; Moore, RD			Suspended sediment dynamics in a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream, Place Creek, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study examined suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during the ablation seasons of 2000 and 2001 in Place Creek, Canada. a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream. Comparison of stream flow in Place Creek with that in an adjacent, almost unglacierized catchment provided a rational basis for separating the ablation seasons into nival, nival-glacial, glacial and autumn recession subseasons. Distinct groupings of points in plots of electrical conductivity against discharge supported the validity of the subseasonal divisions in terms of varying hydrological conditions. Relationships between SSC and discharge (Q) varied between the two study seasons, and between subseasons. Hysteresis in the SSC-Q relationship was evident at both event and weekly time-scales. Some suspended sediment released from proalacial Place Lake (the source of Place Creek) appeared to be lost to channel storage at low flows, especially early in the ablation season, with re-entrainment at higher flows. Multiple regression models were derived for the subseasons using predictor vaniables including Q, Q(2), the change in Q over the previous 3 h, cumulative discharge over the ablation season, total precipitation over the previous 24 h and SSC measured at 1500 hours as an index value for each day. The models produced adjusted R-2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.91, and provided tentative insights into the differences in SSC dynamics amongst subseasons. Introduction of the index value of SSC significantly improved the model fit during the nival-glacial and glacial subseasons for both years, as it adjusts the model to the current condition of sediment supply.

Ecological influences of Thule Inuit whalers on high Arctic pond ecosystems: a comparative paleolimnological study from Bathurst Island (Nunavut, Canada)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Until recently, major anthropogenic impacts on freshwater ecosystems were believed to be rare in North America prior to the period of European colonization. However, recent paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of Thule Inuit, who lived in small, nomadic communities, altered freshwater ecosystems centuries earlier. Using a comparative paleolimnological approach from two ponds situated adjacent to a former Thule winter settlement on south-eastern Bathurst Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), we record marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to eutrophication from the Thule's activities. The geography of our study site provided an interesting and rare opportunity for a comparative paleolimnological study of long-term Thule impacts on polar limnology, because our two study ponds (only similar to 50 m apart) were nearly identical in size and in geological and climatic settings, but differed markedly in the magnitude of Thule influence. Here, we recorded striking changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally-inferred primary production, and nutrient geochemistry, indicating eutrophication in a small pond draining 18 Thule whale houses. Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule for both sustenance and the construction of winter settlements, as well as other anthropogenic activities, coincided with a notable increase in the eutrophic diatom taxon Stephanodiscus minutulus, whereas no comparable changes were recorded in the nearby control pond for the duration of the sedimentary record. Although the diatom changes recorded in the affected site persisted after the period of Thule occupation, the most recent sediments and water chemistry suggest that the pond has largely recovered to near pre-impact conditions.					; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Blais, Jules/0000-0002-7188-3598; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0921-2728					JUN	2010	44	1					85	93		10.1007/s10933-009-9388-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-009-9388-6													WOS:000277939200007

Fluidized aerobic bioreactor (FAB) and sequential batch reactor (SBR) technologies having been recently installed along the periphery of Dal Lake were evaluated for efficiency for a continuous period of 24 months from December 2016 to November 2018. Apart from chemical quality, total coliform (TC), fecal coliform (FC), and fecal streptococci (FS) analyses were also carried out. Major highlights of our work using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) revealed significant variations (p < 0.05) in total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), TC, FC, and FS. Our findings indicate that both technologies are struggling for removal efficiency, which is very low, especially in FAB during three to four months of winter season where a very high drop in the working efficiency of the STP was observed. The treatment facilities did not meet the prescribed standards in respect of TSS, BOD, NH3-N, TP, TC, FC, and FS thereby having the potential to compromise public health and trophic status of Dal Lake.

Both bathing of the yolk-sac fry in thiamine hydrochloride (1000 mg l(-1), 1 h) and a single intraperitoneal injection given to the female brood fish (100 mg kg(-1) fish) during the summer 3 mo before stripping were shown to elevate the whole body total thiamine concentration in the fry. Both treatments were also shown to be effective in preventing mortality due to M74 syndrome. The effect of bathing the yolk-sac fry was shown to be dose-dependent. The results support the view that there is a causal relationship between the thiamine status of the yolk-sac fry and M74 mortality. An intraperitoneal injection of astaxanthine suspension administered to the female brood fish (11 mg kg(-1) fish) in the summer 3 mo before stripping elevated the astaxanthine concentration in the eggs but did not affect mortality due to M74 syndrome. An interaction between astaxanthine and thiamine may occur in the developing embryo or yolk-sac fry, however. No association could be demonstrated between the various thiamine hydrochloride treatment practices and hepatic cytochrome P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresoruffin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the yolk-sac fry. An injection of thiamine hydrochloride into the peritoneal cavity of wild Baltic salmon females could be used to raise thiamine concentrations in their offspring in the rivers. The effect on smolt production in Finnish Baltic salmon rivers needs to be investigated further, however.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				SEP 14	1999	37	3					209	220		10.3354/dao037209	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao037209								10546051					WOS:000083737000007

The resulting circulation and mixing determine the spatial distribution of heat within the lake and affect the heat budget of the ice cover. Although under-ice lake warming is often modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) vertical process, lake bathymetry induces a relative excess heating of shallow waters, creating horizontal density gradients. This study shows that the dynamic response to these gradients depends sensitively on lake size and latitude - Earth's rotation - and is controlled by the Rossby number. In the ageostrophic limit, horizontal density gradients drive cross-shore circulation that transports excess heat to the lake interior, accelerating the under-ice warming there. In the geostrophic regime, the circulation of the near- and off-shore waters decouples, and excess heat is retained in the shallows. The flow regime controls the fate of this excess heat and its contribution to water-induced ice melt.

J	Mumma, SA; Whitlock, C; Pierce, K				Mumma, Stephanie Ann; Whitlock, Cathy; Pierce, Kenneth			A 28,000 year history of vegetation and climate from Lower Red Rock Lake, Centennial Valley, Southwestern Montana, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A sediment core extending to 28,000 cal yr BP from Lower Red Rock Lake in the Centennial Valley of southwestern Montana provides new information on the nature of full-glacial vegetation as well as a history of late-glacial and Holocene vegetation and climate in a poorly studied region. Prior to 17,000 cal yr BP, the eastern Centennial Valley was occupied by a large lake (Pleistocene Lake Centennial), and valley glaciers were present in adjacent mountain ranges. The lake lowered upon erosion of a newly formed western outlet in late-glacial time. High pollen percentages of Juniperus, Poaceae, Asteraceae, and other herbs as well as low pollen accumulation rates suggest sparse vegetation cover. Inferred cold dry conditions are consistent with a strengthened glacial anticyclone at this time. Between 17,000 and 10,500 cal yr BP, high Picea and Abies pollen percentages suggest a shift to subalpine parkland and warmer conditions than before. This is attributed to the northward shift of the jet stream and increasing summer insolation. From 10,500 to 7100 cal yr BP, pollen evidence of open dry forests suggests warm conditions, which were likely a response to increased summer insolation and a strengthened Pacific subtropical high-pressure system. From 7100 to 2400 cal yr BP, cooler moister conditions promoted closed forest and wetlands. Increases in Picea and Abies pollen percentages after 2400 cal yr BP suggest increasing effective moisture. The postglacial pattern of Pseudotsuga expansion indicates that it arrived later on the Atlantic side of the Continental Divide than on the Pacific side. The Divide may have been a physical barrier for refugial populations or it delimited different climate regions that influenced the timing of Pseudotsuga expansion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how eutrophication, the primary water quality issue of aquatic ecosystems, regulates bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly at a regional scale in reservoirs. In this study, we applied a metacommunity framework to study bacterioplankton communities in 210 samples collected from 42 tropical coastal reservoirs in the wet summer season. We found that the spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) at a regional scale was shaped mainly by species sorting. The reservoir trophic state index (TSI) was the key determinant of bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly. BCC turnover increased significantly with the TSI differences between sites ( increment TSI) when increment TSI was 20, but remained at a level of about 80% when increment TSI was 20. Compared to oligo-mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs, increased heterogeneity of co-occurrence bacterioplankton networks and bacterioplankton beta-diversity were observed across eutrophic reservoirs. We propose that larger variation in phytoplankton community assembly may play directly or indirectly deterministic processes in controlling the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and became the potential mechanisms behind the observed higher BCC heterogeneity across the eutrophic reservoirs. Our research contributes to a broader understanding of the ecological effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems and provides clues to the management of the tropical coastal reservoirs.

The current research proposes a promising framework to refine the concept of surface hydrological connectivity by combining hydrodynamic modeling experiments, threshold effects and geostatistical connectivity analysis, exemplified by the flood-pulse-influenced Poyang Lake floodplain system (China). To enhance the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco-environments, total connectivity (TC), general connectivity (GC), and effective connectivity (EC) were proposed to refine the metrics of hydrological connectivity. The results show that substantial differences between the three connectivity metrics are observed for all target directions, demonstrating that the joint role of water depth and flow velocity may produce more dynamic and complex influences on EC than the other two metrics of TC and GC. Topographically, the connectivity objects/areas within the flood pulse system reveal that the floodplain is a more sensitive area than the lake's main flow channels under different connectivity conditions. The modelling experimental studies show that variations in water depth thresholds are more likely to have a strong effect on connectivity for the dry, rising, and falling limbs, rather than the flooding period, while the flow velocity may exert an opposite threshold effect. The lake-floodplain system is characterized by a dynamic threshold behavior, with seasonally varying water depth and velocity thresholds. This study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for facilitating scientific communication by combining hydrodynamic thresholds and offering recommendations for future connectivity assessments using our proposed metrics of TC, GC, and EC.

The response of basin wetlands to climate changes: a review of case studies from the Swan Coastal Plain, south-western Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A review of stratigraphic, radiocarbon, pollen, and aerial photographic data on the Swan Coastal Plain, south-western Australia, allows interpretation of long-term changes in climate and its effects on wetlands during the Holocene, whereas monitoring wetland hydrology and vegetation provides a measure of shorter-term changes. The information provides models for basin wetland response to changing climate. Drying climates shift wetlands to drier conditions, turning lakes into seasonally inundated or waterlogged basins, or resulting in an overall loss of wetlands, and favours more saline conditions, and development of carbonate deposits. Wetter conditions results in more frequent inundation, shifting damplands to sumplands or lakes, and resulting in fresher water conditions, and development of peat and/or organic matter enriched deposits. Examples of wetland basin responses to climate change across the Swan Coastal Plain show differential responses depending on setting, spatial distribution, hydrology, hydrochemistry and geochemistry, different temporal frameworks, and biological resilience.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2013	708	1					45	67		10.1007/s10750-012-1161-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1161-6													WOS:000317628200004

Dissolved concentrations of Fe, Mn, organic carbon, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and pH were determined in the water column and the interstital waters on 39 occasions. Trace metal concentrations remained low throughout the year in both water column and pore waters. There was evidence for some remobilization at the sediment-water interface but sediments deeper than 3 cm acted as a sink throughout the year. Variations in the water concentrations were largely associated with increased loading during periods of heavy rainfall. During the summer, concentrations of cu and Zn in the waters overlying the sediments were enhanced by release from decomposing algal material. Similarly, enhanced concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were observed during periods of much reduced mixing during ice-cover. Although there were large seasonal variations in the concentrations of dissolved and particulate Fe and Mn, there were no comparable changes in the concentrations of trace metals.

The experimental lake was compared to a nearby reference site (Valkea-Kotinen Lake). During the first phase of the experiment the thermocline of Halsjarvi was lowered in order to simulate the estimated increase in wind speed and in total lake heat content (high-change climate scenario). The rate of methyl mercury (MeHg) production during summer stagnation (May-August) was calculated from water profiles before the treatment (2004), during treatment (2005, 2006) and after treatment (2007). We also calculated fluxes of MeHg from the epilimnion and from the hypolimnion to the sediments using sediment traps. Experimental mixing with a submerged propeller caused a 1.5-2 m deepening of the thermocline and oxycline. Methyl mercury production occurred mostly in the oxygen free layers in both lakes. In the experimental lake there was no net increase in MeHg during the experiment and following year; whereas the reference lake showed net production for all years. We conclude that the new exposed epilimnetic sediments caused by a lowering of the thermocline were a major sink for MeHg in the epilimnion. The results demonstrate that in-lake MeHg production can be manipulated in small lakes with anoxic hypolimnia during summer. The climate change induced changes in small boreal lakes most probably affect methyl mercury production and depend on the lake characteristics and stratification pattern. The results support the hypothesis that possible oxygen related changes caused by climate change are more important than possible temperature changes in small polyhumic lakes with regularly occurring oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.

Lake carbonate-δ18O records from the Yukon Territory, Canada: Little Ice Age moisture variability and patterns	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 1000-yr history of climate change in the central Yukon Territory, Canada, is inferred from sediment composition and isotope geochemistry from small, groundwater fed, Seven Mile Lake. Recent observations of lake-water delta O-18, lake level, river discharge, and climate variations, suggest that changes in regional effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) are reflected by the lake's hydrologic balance. The observations indicate that the lake is currently O-18-enriched by summer evaporation and that during years of increased precipitation, when groundwater inflow rates to the lake increase, lake-water delta O-18 values decrease. Past lake-water delta O-18 values are inferred from oxygen isotope ratios of fine-grained sedimentary endogenic carbonate. Variations in carbonate delta O-18, supplemented by those in carbonate and organic delta C-13, C/N ratios, and organic carbon, carbonate and biogenic silica accumulation rates, document changes in effective moisture at decadal time scales during the early Little Ice Age period to present. Results indicate that between similar to AD 1000 and 1600, effective moisture was higher than today. A shift to more arid climate conditions occurred after similar to AD 1650. The 19th and 20th centuries have been the driest of the past millennium. Temporal variations correspond with inferred shifts in summer evaporation from Marcella Lake delta O-18, a similarly small, stratified, alkaline lake located similar to 250 km to the southwest, suggesting that the combined reconstructions accurately document the regional paleoclimate of the east-central interior. Comparison with regional glacial activity suggests differing regional moisture patterns during early and late Little Ice Age advances. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ding, ZY; Lu, RJ; Lyu, ZQ; Liu, XK				Ding, Zhiyong; Lu, Ruijie; Lyu, Zhiqiang; Liu, Xiaokang			Geochemical characteristics of Holocene aeolian deposits east of Qinghai Lake, China, and their paleoclimatic implications	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The paleoclimate evolution of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), especially in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), has long been a subject of interest to scholars due to the particularity of the geographical location. However, because of the uncertainties of the chronologies and the interpretations of the proxies used, climate change in this region remains controversial during the Holocene. The Hudong dunefield is located to the east of Qinghai Lake and is the largest sand accumulation area in the QLB. In this study, deposits in the Holocene aeolian sandpaleosol sequences Chengou East (CGE) and Qinghaihu Country (QHH) in the Hudong dunefield were analyzed to determine their elemental geochemical characteristics and paleoclimatic implications. Combining the grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) and redness, we investigate the paleoclimate changes in this region and its response to the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the Holocene. The high Na2O/Al2O3 ratios and low chemical index of alteration (CIA) values suggest that most of the sediments are unweathered to weakly weathered, although some mid-Holocene samples are moderately weathered. The multiproxy analysis indicates that the local climate was broadly coincident with that of the northeastern TP and most regions of northern China, implying that the paleodimate of the QLB was closely related with the evolution of the EASM during the Holocene. Additionally, after the 9.2 ka BP cold event, the chemical weathering increased gradually. The higher CIA and TOC contents and lower redness and mean grain size from 8.7 to 4.0 ka BP are possibly associated with the mid-Holocene optimum period and indicate intensified chemical weathering, denser vegetation cover and weakened aeolian activity in the QLB in response to a warmer and more humid climate. After 4.0 ka BP, the lower degrees of chemical weathering indicate that the study area was dominated by a relatively cold and thy climate, and several alternating warm-wet and cold-dry intervals occurred from 3.1 to 0.6 ka BP.

Evaluation of Alexandria Eastern Harbor evaporation estimate methods	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The best evaporation estimate method for Alexandria Eastern Harbor has been derived following the evaluation of performance of five evaporation estimate methods, namely, (1) Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB), (2) De Bruin-Keijman (DK), (3) Priestley-Taylor (PT), (4) Brutsaert-Stricker (BS), and (5) Penman (PM), based on two consecutive summer seasons of 2010 and 2011 data. Different statistical measurements of goodness of fit, namely, coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), relative bias (RB), and index of agreement (D) have been chosen for the evaluation of the performance. When the Bowen ratio is known a priori, the DK and PT methods have been found the best evaporation estimate methods. The responses of the three methods BREB, DK, and PT were found comparable to each other, while the PM method response differed to match with the responses of the other three methods. The Bowen ration () of 0.05 and Priestley-Taylor (PT) coefficient () of 1.23 derived from the analysis can be extended for evaporation estimates in Alexandria Eastern Harbor, Egypt.

Very high densities of fry (1177-1313 per 100 m2) and parr (66-108 per 100 m2) recorded below a lake outfall were attributed to a high production (1.65 kg wet weight m-1 year-1) of Simulium larvae. Elsewhere, values were lower and in certain instances were attributable to low stream temperatures (maximum summer temperature 10-degrees-C) and unstable substrate. Minimum values for lake smolt production ranged from 0.005 to 0.035 g m-2 year-1. In one year, a proportion of the smolt population remained in the lake beyond the normal migration season (late May-late June) and grew to a large size (up to 25.0 cm).

Based on two sedimentary sequences, namely a peat profile and a fluvial and swamp sequence from the tropical NW Leizhou Peninsula in South China, we interpret more negative bulk organic delta C-13 values to suggest wetter and warmer conditions, implying a stronger East Asian (EA) summer monsoon, and less negative delta C-13 values to indicate drier and cooler conditions, reflecting a weakening of the EA summer monsoon. A warm and wet period occurred between c. 48.0 and 28.0 cal. ka BP. In the study region, a climate shift occurred at c. 22.0 (or 20.0) cal. ka BP, and the driest and coldest period occurred between c. 19.0 and 16.0 cal. ka BP. After c. 12.0 cal. ka BP, the climate changed towards wetter and warmer conditions. Several possible millennial-scale dry and cold oscillations characterized possibly by C4 plants, or by more positive organic delta C-13 values during the period when C3 plants dominated, are cautiously and tentatively interpreted as showing a similarity with Heinrich events and other cold millennial-scale oscillations evidenced from a Greenland ice core and Chinese stalagmite. We demonstrate that bulk organic delta C-13 records of sedimentary sequences in the study region have potential for indicating the changes in vegetation composition that were closely associated with climate variation during the last glacial period.

Submerged vegetation colonizes behind artificial wave shelter after a 10-year time-lag and persists under high grazing pressure by waterbirds	AQUATIC BOTANY												Construction of artificial wave shelters is a promising measure to stimulate submerged vegetation in large wind exposed lakes. Here we tested whether the construction of shelter results in the colonization of submerged vegetation and whether grazing by waterbirds hampers vegetation development under those sheltered conditions. We studied the effect of breakwaters that were constructed between 1992 and 1996 in the large (695 km(2)), wind exposed and turbid Lake Markermeer, The Netherlands. We used monitoring data to evaluate the development of submerged vegetation and its relation with the abundance of herbivorous birds and conducted a field grazer exclosure experiment to determine the effect of grazers on the newly established vegetation. We found that in the sheltered area, a dense charophyte dominated vegetation developed over 16 years, while submerged vegetation remained very sparse outside the breakwaters. The area also attracted many herbivorous birds, especially molting Mute swans during summer. After the breakwaters had been completed, 10 years passed before the development of the charophyte vegetation started. This delay was probably not caused by bird grazing, but more likely due to unfavorable light conditions in the first decade. The exclosure experiment confirmed that while grazing reduced macrophyte biomass by 50% and plant height by 45%, it did not affect vegetation cover, which remained high (90-95%) throughout summer. The water depth in most of the study area exceeded the depth range at which Mute swans prefer to forage and this probably prevented overgrazing. We conclude that building artificial wave shelters is an effective measure to stimulate submerged vegetation in large wind exposed lakes.

The range of transmittance values directly under the ice was remarkably narrow (excluding snow-covered ice) and markedly different from values lower in the water column.																			0018-8158					JUL 5	1991	218	1					15	25		10.1007/BF00006414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006414													WOS:A1991GE26400002

Anoxic conditions in the Lake and high concentrations of sulfur compounds (up to 10(-4) M, mainly in the form of sulfide) were detected below the 9 m depth in the periods of stable stratification in 1994 and 1995. At the boundary between oxic and anoxic conditions (chemocline), the presence of purple sulfur bacteria (genus Chromatium) and a maximum concentration of thiosulfate (8 x 10(-6) M) were detected. The stratification and mixing of lake water were greatly influenced by rainfall, as shown from decreased salinity in deeper waters. High phytoplankton activity over the entire water column and an extremely high production of oxygen (oxygen saturation up to 300%) probably prevented the expected development of anoxia during the spring of 1996.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193													0011-1643					MAY	1998	71	2					217	232																WOS:000074204000003

Small cladocerans, copepod nauplii and rotifers often dominate the zooplankton community in tropical and subtropical lakes. This is probably because of high predation pressure by small omnivorous-planktivorous fish, but experimental evidence is scarce. 2. This study used two approaches to test the effect of the small omnivorous-planktivorous fish species Jenynsia multidentata, which is frequently abundant in (sub)tropical eutrophic lakes in South America, on the size distribution of zooplankton. In Lake Blanca (Uruguay), which lacks any piscivores, we sampled seasonally for both fish and zooplankton. We also conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment with treatments containing or lacking J. multidentata. 3. Together, the empirical and experimental data suggest that J. multidentata predation plays an important role in modulating the size structure of the zooplankton community in subtropical lakes. In the absence of J. multidentata, stocked large-sized zooplankters like Daphnia obtusa were abundant in the experiments, while small-sized zooplankton dominated in the presence of fish, as they did in the lake itself from spring to the end of the season.

The lake was characterized by a high level of sulfate (91-116 mM). The concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic waters of the lake reached 0.6 mM. In summer the sulfate reduction rate in the water column, measured by radiometric technique, varied from 0.25 to 9.81 mumol sulfate l(-1) d(-1). There were two peaks of sulfate reduction activity: just below the chemocline and near the sediment surface. Sulfate reduction rate in the profundal silts ranged from 4.1 to 90.6 mumol l(-1) d(-1). The zone of the most active sulfate reduction was restricted to the surface sediment layers. The acceleration of sulfate reduction rate (up to 236 mumol l(-1) d(-1)) and the increase of density of viable sulfate reducers (up to 2x10(5) cells ml(-1)) were recorded in the littoral sediments adjacent to the mouth of the Son River and sewage discharge. It was apparently caused by the input of allochthonous organic substrates and also by a high environmental temperature. On an areal basis, sulfate reduction rate in the water was approximately 8 times higher than that in the profundal sediments. Sulfate reduction was the most important process of anaerobic oxidation of organic carbon in Lake Shira. In summer in the profundal zone of the lake, sulfate reducers were able to mineralize about 67% of the daily integrated primary production of phototrophic and chemotrophic organisms.

L.; Thaulow, Jens			Detection of an invasive aquatic plant in natural water bodies using environmental DNA	PLOS ONE												The ability to detect founding populations of invasive species or rare species with low number of individuals is important for aquatic ecosystem management. Traditional approaches use historical data, knowledge of the species' ecology and time-consuming surveys. Within the past decade, environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful additional tracking tool. While much work has been done with animals, comparatively very little has been done with aquatic plants. Here we investigated the transportation and seasonal changes in eDNA concentrations for an invasive aquatic species, Elodea canadensis, in Norway. A specific probe assay was developed using chloroplast DNA to study the fate of the targeted eDNA through space and time. The spatial study used a known source of Elodea canadensis within Lake Nordbytjern 400 m away from the lake outlet flowing into the stream Tveia. The rate of disappearance of E. canadensis eDNA was an order of magnitude loss over about 230 m in the lake and 1550 m in the stream. The time series study was performed monthly from May to October in lake Steinsfjorden harbouring E. canadensis, showing that eDNA concentrations varied by up to three orders of magnitude, peaking during fall. In both studies, the presence of suspended clay or turbidity for some samples did not hamper eDNA analysis. This study shows how efficient eDNA tools may be for tracking aquatic plants in the environment and provides key spatial and temporal information on the fate of eDNA.

TO WATER LEVEL DRAWDOWN IN A TURBID WATER RESERVOIR	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The research focuses on the effects of seasonal water level drawdown on the submerged vegetation in a turbid water reservoir measured through the biomass, the maximum depth of colonization and the occurrence frequency of hornwort Ceratophyllum demersum L. Furthermore, the underwater light intensity, water turbidity and biovolume of planktonic algae were determined to evaluate the environmental factors affecting the development of macrophytes. Because of low global radiation in late summer, the irradiance in the period following the water level drawdown was lower compared to the preceding period, but still above the species tolerance level. Nonetheless, the water level regulation improved the underwater light conditions for submerged macrophytes through the water level reduction. Plant biomass, the incidence of Ceratophyllum demersum and the maximum depth of macrophyte colonization increased after the water level drawdown in deep phytolittoral, whereas no effects were observed in shallows. Our research showed that the water level changes could be a useful tool in treatments aimed at maintaining the aquatic vegetation and improving the water quality in regulated water bodies.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2015	13	1					219	228																WOS:000354729800015

This study investigated the presence of OPEs in surface water of Taihu Lake from 2012 and 2021-2022. The OPEs concentration was compared ten years ago and ten years later. Water and meteorological parameters were ranked using the random forest (RF) model, and OPEs concentration in lakes was simulated using selected parameters as inputs. The concentration of sigma 7OPEs was higher ten years ago compared to ten years later. There was no significant seasonal difference in sigma 7OPEs from 2021-2022, while the concentration of sigma 7OPEs in 2012 was lower in summer than in other seasons. The spatial distribution of the two interannual sigma 7OPEs exhibited a decreasing trend from the northwest region. The results of RF importance ranking and redundancy analysis showed that NH3-N, TN, TP, water temperature and relative humidity were the most influential factors affecting OPEs concentrations. RF models performed better for TnBP, as indicated by training R and test R values are excellent and relatively low errors. Our results demonstrated that machine learning models were useful in facilitating efficient monitoring and assessment of OPEs contamination in lakes.					; Liu, Kai/JNR-4924-2023	He, Huan/0000-0003-3460-2491; xiao, hui/0000-0001-8953-0160; Liu, Kai/0000-0002-2978-0368													0304-3894	1873-3336				JAN 5	2024	461								132654	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132654		OCT 2023						37788554					WOS:001090465700001
J	Cook, M; Chafetz, HS				Cook, Megan; Chafetz, Henry S.			Sloping fan travertine, Belen, New Mexico, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Pliocene to Quaternary age travertines are very well-exposed in quarries near Belen, New Mexico, U.S.A., on the western edge of the Rio Grande Rift system. A series of hillside springs produced travertine tongues tens of meters thick and hundreds of meters long. The accumulations represent deposits from individual springs as well as the amalgamation of deposits. The overall architecture is predominantly composed of sloping fans with a smaller component of terrace mounds. The sloping fan deposits commonly have a dip of <10 degrees, however, they range from horizontal to near vertical. Individual strata display significant changes in depositional dip, beds pinch and swell, and some are completely truncated. Centimeter to meter scale terrace mounds exhibit the common stair-step morphology. As a consequence of vertical accretion in the pools, terrace mounds morphed into sloping fans. The travertine is composed of a variety of commonly reported constituents, i.e., centimeter thick laminae of bacterial shrubs and oncoids, foam rock, sheets and rafts, and finely crystalline crusts that occur throughout the sloping fan and terrace mound accumulations. Sheets and rafts formed as precipitates in pools on the surfaces of the fans and terraces as well as spelean deposits on the water surfaces of pools within cavities in the overall accumulation. Thus, the spelean rafts provide valuable indicators of original horizontality in the sloping fan strata. In addition, intraformational breccias, composed of locally torn-up travertine intraclastic boulders and deposited in with other travertine, and extraformational breccias, composed of torn-up travertine intraclasts mixed with siliciclastic fines and sand and Paleozoic limestone clasts transported downslope from higher on the hillside, are a common constituent in the sloping fan accumulation. The Belen travertines provide a very well-exposed example of sloping fan travertines and may provide relevant data with regard to the subsurface Aptian Pre-Salt deposits, offshore Brazil.

Biochemical fractionation was done by consecutive differential extractions in order to separate proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and low molecular weight compounds (LMW) by virtue of their relative solubilities in different extraction solvents. Independent of depth and season, the principal photosynthetic end products were polysaccharides followed by proteins, LMW and lipids. However, inorganic carbon allocation into macromolecules varied, in these two lakes, with depth and with the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton. Carbon allocation into polysaccharides decreased with increasing depth, especially in the brown-colored humic lake, and Diatoms showed high C incorporation into polysaccharides.																			0018-8158					MAR 24	1995	300						57	70		10.1007/BF00024448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024448													WOS:A1995RB62500006

Declining Aluminum Toxicity and the Role of Exposure Duration on Brook Trout Mortality in Acidified Streams of the Adirondack Mountains, New York, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Mortality of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and water chemistry were characterized in 6 headwater streams in the western Adirondacks of New York during spring 2015, 2016, and 2017 and compared with results from analogous tests done between 1980 and 2003 in many of the same streams, to assess temporal changes in toxicity and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-i) concentrations, and the role of Al-i exposure duration on brook trout survival. The Al-i concentrations of 2 and 4 mu mol L-1 corresponded to low-to-moderate and high mortality thresholds, but prolonged exposure to >= 1 mu mol Al-i L-1 also produced mortality. The variability, mean, and highest Al-i concentrations in Buck Creek year round, and in several other streams during spring, have decreased significantly over the past 3 decades. Logistic models indicate that Al-i surpassed highly toxic concentrations in Buck Creek for 3 to 4 mo annually during 2001 to 2003 and for 2 to 3 wk annually during 2015 to 2017. The loss of extremely high Al-i episodes indicates that toxicity has declined markedly between the 1989 to 1990, 2001 to 2003, and 2015 to 2017 test periods, yet Al-i concentrations can still cause moderate-to-high and complete (100%) mortality. The logistic models illustrate how mortality of brook trout in several Adirondack streams likely decreased in response to the 1990 Amendments to the United States' Clean Air Act (which decreased acidity, Al-i concentrations, and duration of toxic episodes) and offer a means to predict how changes in US regulations that limit emissions of NOx and SOx (and N and S deposition loads) could affect fish survival and stream ecosystems in this region and across the Northeast.

Probabilistic prediction of cyanobacteria abundance in a Korean reservoir using a Bayesian Poisson model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												There have been increasing reports of harmful algal blooms (HABs) worldwide. However, the factors that influence cyanobacteria dominance and HAB formation can be site-specific and idiosyncratic, making prediction challenging. The drivers of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Paldang, South Korea, the summer climate of which is strongly affected by the East Asian monsoon, may differ from those in well-studied North American lakes. Using the observational data sampled during the growing season in 2007-2011, a Bayesian hurdle Poisson model was developed to predict cyanobacteria abundance in the lake. The model allowed cyanobacteria absence (zero count) and nonzero cyanobacteria counts to be modeled as functions of different environmental factors. The model predictions demonstrated that the principal factor that determines the success of cyanobacteria was temperature. Combined with high temperature, increased residence time indicated by low outflow rates appeared to increase the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence. A stable water column, represented by low suspended solids, and high temperature were the requirements for high abundance of cyanobacteria. Our model results had management implications; the model can be used to forecast cyanobacteria watch or alert levels probabilistically and develop mitigation strategies of cyanobacteria blooms.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAR	2014	50	3					2518	2532		10.1002/2013WR014372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013WR014372													WOS:000334111600037

These predictions agree closely with data from 65 central European lakes during summer stratification. In addition, zooplankton biomass was strongly negatively related to mixing depth in a subset of lakes. A decrease in mixing depth is thus a form of enrichment with light of the mixed surface layer, the effects of which could propagate to higher trophic levels.

Telemetry and genetic data characterize lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) breeding ecology and spawning site fidelity in Green Bay Rivers of Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)	SEP 19-22, 2016	Hood River, OR	N Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish Soc				The primary objective of this study was to use direct (acoustic telemetry) and indirect (genetic assignment) methods to characterize basic aspects of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) breeding ecology. Specifically, data on natal origin, spawning habitat, spawn sex-size structure, and sex-specific residence times, spawning site fidelity, seasonal movements and degree of straying between demographically and genetically independent populations. A secondary benefit of the project was the non-spawning period movements of tagged fish. The analysis was based on acoustic telemetry and genetic assignment tests for individuals captured from the Menominee, Peshtigo, Oconto and Fox rivers (draining into Green Bay) in Wisconsin, which represent the only spawning rivers in western Lake Michigan. Sturgeon (N = 160) were captured during the spring (18 April-25 May) of 2011-2015 using large dip nets (51%) and electro fishing (49%). Captured sturgeon were genotyped and assigned to a Great Lakes river population using likelihood-based estimators based on microsatellite (N = 13) genotype and mtDNA haplotype frequencies. Assignments revealed that captured adults from four Green Bay rivers were of an aggregate composition from the overall sample size (N = 160) of 38.2% assigned to the Fox-Wolf River population, 23.5% to the Menominee River population and 37.4% to the Peshtigo-Oconto River population. One adult female sturgeon was assigned to the Manistee River population (eastern Lake Michigan). Of the 160 captured adults, 115 spawning lake sturgeon were tagged with surgically inserted acoustic tags/transmitters (Vemco V-16). Collected lake sturgeon ranged in size from 114 cm to 185 cm total length, and girth from 43 cm to 74cm. Visual examination during surgery confirmed the sex of each individually tagged fish. Timing of post-surgery departure from the rivers differed significantly between males (mean 35.6days) and females (mean 8.9 days), but was not significant because of the large variability. Post-surgery residence time was longer for the Menominee River sturgeon compared to individuals from the other rivers. More than twice as many males versus females were detected in the four rivers during the non-spawning period. A subsample of 53 lake sturgeon returned to one of the four rivers 1.9-3.4 years after surgery. Eight males returned to one of the four rivers in successive springs but no female sturgeon returned in successive years. High straying (i.e., dispersal to a non-native stream to spawn) rates occurred among rivers. Transition probability was highest for lake sturgeon captured in the Peshtigo and Oconto Rivers moving to the Fox River (0.77), and Fox River captured lake sturgeon moving to the Peshtigo and Oconto rivers (0.21). Since these populations represent the only spawning sturgeon in western Lake Michigan, lake sturgeons associated with these rivers represent spawning populations of significant importance towards their restoration in Lake Michigan. This study improved the understanding of the species breeding ecology and movement patterns needed to guide management decisions, such as prioritizing habitats for restoration or protection.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2018	34	2			SI		302	313		10.1111/jai.13561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13561													WOS:000428797200006

Patterns of cell death in freshwater colonial cyanobacteria during the late summer bloom	PHYCOLOGIA												The occurrence of senescence (Evans blue staining) and progammed cell death (Hoechst staining/TUNEL reaction) was studied in the colonial cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae and Microcystis flos-aquae during the late summer bloom in a eutrophic lake. Algae were analysed over a seven-day period (three sampling days) within mixed phytoplankton samples obtained from the upper epilimnion (trawl-net sample) and lower epilimnion (sediment-trap sample). Death of Anabaena in the trawl-net population was attributed to widespread infection by a chytrid fungus, resulting in breakdown and positive Evans blue staining of most filamentous colonies. Associated akinetes were a mixture of senescent cells (30% of total, Evans blue stained) and viable cells (unstained) plus a few dead cells (no contents). Sedimentation resulted in loss of filamentous colonies, leaving groups of akinetes with about 30% nonviable cells (senescent and dead). Over the sampling period, 20-50% of Microcystis colonies in the trawl-net samples showed some cells with clear Evans blue staining, indicating widespread senescence in the algal population. The occurrence of programmed cell death in some colonies of Microcystis was indicated by a positive TUNEL reaction and by condensed regions of nucleoid DNA in Hoechst-stained material. The results suggest that senescence was a general response to adverse environmental conditions (no fungal infection), with at least 30% (minimum count) of cells in affected colonies switching to programmed cell death. The induction of cell death within individual cells occurred randomly throughout the colony (nearest-neighbour comparison to random distribution) and was unrelated to the cell cycle - since both stained and unstained cells included the full range of cell size, from dividing cells to large nondividing cells.

Debris-flow areas are most pronounced in three regions: in the Eastern Sayan Mountains, in the mountain ridge at the southern end of Lake Baikal, and in the Northern Baikal Region. Debris-flows from the years 1871 and 1971 stand out as covering the largest area. There is some association of powerful debris-flows with strong earthquakes, solar activity cycles and with periods of increased rain fall.																					0-7844-0268-X				1997							332	339																WOS:000078856200034

Interestingly, Cyanobacterium was found to be dominant even in low-temperature seasons, especially winter leading to more effective for diatom growth. Factors such as phytoplankton, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and phosphorous showed high WQI over 70% at 20 degrees C, but declined to 40% at temperatures above 25 degrees C. WQI for Cyanobacteria decreased with increasing water temperature, whereas for diatoms WQI was 90% regardless of water temperature. Additionally, bacterial density and total nitrogen showed very low WQI without water temperature. Collectively, the results indicate that high water temperature decreased WQI ability of a PMC to control phytoplankton (Microcystis aeruginosa) and increased their ability to control diatoms.

In this study, an attempt to analyze the soil record of recent climate changes was made. An example of soil evolution induced by climate change was studied on hydromorphic saline soils in the nature reserve of the Varnicy Saline Spring. In a humid climate, soil salinization occurring in discharge areas can quickly change in response to the changed hydrothermal regime because of close relationships between climatic conditions and groundwater systems. In a poorly drained depression, we could observe an increasing soil salinity and developing hydrogenic accumulation of salts, whereas the groundwater salinity was stable.

Harvest Mortality of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) Banded at Lake St. Clair, CAN and Western Lake Erie, USA	WATERBIRDS												Coastal marshes of Lake St. Clair, in southwest Ontario, CAN and Lake Erie, in northwest Ohio, USA are important migratory staging locations for waterfowl despite experiencing substantial wetland losses. Waterfowl habitat management at these locations focuses on providing food resources for Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a highly sought game species. We examined direct recovery rates of Mallards banded prior to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 hunting seasons as a measure of harvest mortality. We compared harvest mortality between the two locations, among years, among four sex and age cohorts, and as a function of body condition. We found that banding location for juvenile Mallards was an important variable predicting harvest mortality. The probability of being a direct recovery was 126% greater for juvenile females and 70% greater for juvenile males banded at Lake St. Clair compared to those banded in northwest Ohio. Average body condition was slightly less for juvenile male Mallards banded in northwest Ohio during 2016 compared to those banded in 2015 or those banded in LSC in 2014 or 2015. We did not detect any other significant differences related to body condition and location or location-year with respect to direct recovery rates. We hypothesize that harvest mortality of juvenile Mallards could be related to differences in harvest regulations, bird abundances, or hunter density between the two study sites, all of which may have different implications for those interested in managing Mallard populations in the lower Great Lakes region.

Traces of the Tunguska Event (1908) in Sediments of Zapovednoe Lake Based on SR-XRF Data	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												An anomalous layer enriched with chemical elements indicating the presence of terrigenous matter was discovered in the sediment core of Zapovednoe Lake located 60 km from the epicenter of the Tunguska event (1908) using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SR-XRF). Radioisotope measurements indicate that the age of the layer is consistent with the date of the catastrophe. Apparently, the anomalous layer was formed as a result of an intense terrigenous matter inflow from the water catchment area due to massive forest falls and subsequent wildfires caused by the Tunguska event. Thus, it is established that targeted searches for microparticles of extraterrestrial origin can be carried out in the discovered and dated anomalous bottom sediment layer.

Biogeochemical asynchrony: Ecosystem drivers of seasonal concentration regimes across the Great Lakes Basin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Changes in seasonal nutrient dynamics are occurring across a range of climates and land use types. Although it is known that seasonal patterns in nutrient availability are key drivers of both stream metabolism and eutrophication, there has been little success in developing a comprehensive understanding of seasonal variations in nutrient export across watersheds or of the relationship between nutrient seasonality and watershed characteristics. In the present study, we have used concentration and discharge data from more than 200 stations across U.S. and Canadian watersheds to identify (1) archetypal seasonal concentration regimes for nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus, and (2) dominant watershed controls on these regimes across a gradient of climate, land use, and topography. Our analysis shows that less impacted watersheds, with more forested and wetland area, most commonly exhibit concentration regimes that are in phase with discharge, with concentration lows occurring during summer low-flow periods. Agricultural watersheds also commonly exhibit in-phase behavior, though the seasonality is usually muted compared to that seen in less impacted areas. With increasing urban area, however, nutrient concentrations frequently become essentially aseasonal or even exhibit clearly out-of-phase behavior. In addition, our data indicate that seasonal SRP concentration patterns may be strongly influenced by proximal controls such as the presence of dams and reservoirs. In all, these results suggest that human activity is significantly altering nutrient concentration regimes, with large potential consequences for both in-stream metabolism and eutrophication risk in downstream waterbodies.

Role of the copepod parasite Tracheliastes maculatus Kollar, 1836 (Lernaeopodidae) in the common bream (Abramis brama) mortality occurring in Lake Balaton, Hungary	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												Tracheliastes maculatus is a copepod crustacean parasite belonging to the family Lernaeopodidae. In the late spring months, around the time of spawning, large numbers of the imago stages of that parasite can be found attached to the scales of common bream in Lake Balaton every year. Due to their bright red colour, the small ulcers formed at the site of parasite attachment are highly conspicuous even to non-specialists, calling attention to the presence of infestation. In 2008, T. maculatus infestation affecting the bream stock of Lake Balaton proved to be more intensive than usual. The intensity of infestation of the 3- to 5-year-old bream specimens markedly exceeded the usual level of 7-12 parasites per bream, and infestation could be detected also on the 2-year-old bream specimens 12 to 14 cm in length. On the 2-year-old bream specimens, the inflammatory zone of bacterial origin, which was mostly limited to a single scale on breams of bigger body size, involved a larger area, resulting in scaleless areas and extensive superficial erosions developing in the place of the parasitic focus that had become detached together with the attacked scale. When samples from the haemorrhagic areas, from the serum accumulating in the scale pouches and from the kidney were inoculated onto blood agar, colonies of the facultative pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila grew out. In addition to the sporadic mortality regularly occurring among older fish specimens in the late spring period simultaneously with parasite infestation, this year mortality could be observed also in the younger age groups of bream.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate an improved approach to study seafloor seepages in the Arctic coastal zone with an echosounder calibrated on site. During wintertime field observations of natural rising gas bubbles, we recorded three periods of their increased activity with a total of 63 short-term ejections of bubbles from the seabed. This study presents quantitative estimates of the methane (CH4) flux obtained in wintertime at two levels of the water column: (1) at the bottom/water interface and (2) at the water/sea ice interface. In winter, the flux of CH4 transported by rising bubbles to the bottom water in the shallow part of the ESAS was estimated at similar to 19 g center dot m(-2) per day, while the flux reaching the water/sea ice interface was calculated as similar to 15 g center dot m(-2) per day taking into account the diffusion of CH4 in the surrounding water and the enrichment of rising bubbles with nitrogen and oxygen. We suggest that this bubble-transported CH4 flux reaching the water /sea ice interface can be emitted into the atmosphere through numerous ice trenches, leads, and polynyas. This CH4 ebullition value detected at the water/sea ice interface is in the mid high range of CH4 ebullition value estimated for the entire ESAS, and two orders higher than the upper range of CH4 ebullition from the northern thermocarst lakes, which are considered as a significant source to the atmospheric methane budget.

Bacterio-phages (dsDNA) (Herelleviridae family) infecting the phylum Firmicutes and Siphoviridae were predominant in most lakes evaluated. Functional analysis demonstrated a prevalence of unknown proteins (68 %) in the virome.

First Results of a Drone Thermal Imaging Survey of Geological Objects in the Lake Baikal Area	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The first results of a thermal imaging survey of geological objects located along the coast of Lake Baikal are presented. The studies showed that the temperature of the well known Zmeinyi and Zagza thermal springs recorded on infrared images obtained using UAV at a flight of 30-70 m is 10-12.5 degrees C lower than on the ground. In the daylight hours, the areas with green vegetation are the coldest; the rocky areas, including bedrock outcrops, are the hottest. In mid-September, the difference in the temperature between these areas reaches up to 20-21 degrees C. Under night-time (morning before sunrise) conditions, the situation changes in the opposite direction, and the temperature difference is up to 8-9 degrees C. Thermal anomalies of the Earth's surface were discovered for the first time on the basis of the established patterns of the temperature distribution in the zone of the Primorskii Fault, in the area of the Sarma River. These anomalies can be associated with a deep source of heat that emanates through fractures, as evidenced by the comparison of the optical imaging of the granite outcrop with its heat map. The results obtained offer a challenge for the development of technology to search for endogenous heat sources in fault zones on the basis of the thermal imaging carried out by unmanned aerial vehicles.

Accumulation rates of ammonium nitrogen in amino acid fortifiedf and unfortified samples of epilimnetic Lake Michigan water, incubated in the dark, provided reasonable estimates of potential and actual rates of organic nitrogen mineralization. The labile organic nitrogen demand (LOND), defined as the difference between these respective rates, provided an index of heterotrophic potential. LOND ranged from .apprx. 1-3 ng-atoms N liter h-1 (during May-June and November) to 3-9 ng-atoms N liter h-1 (during July-October) as compared to actual organic nitrogen mineralization rates of < 1 ng-atom N liter h-1 in some unfortified samples. The high LOND, relative to actual turnover, observed in late summer is consistent with the hypothesis that growth rates of epilimnetic Lake Michigan bacteria are strongly limited by organic substrate during late stratifications.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1989	34	2					478	485		10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0478	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0478													WOS:A1989U538800021

The present study reviews observed and modelled changes in the climate, cryosphere and impacts related to hazards, agriculture and ecosystems. An increasing temperature trend over the IHR is reported, which over a few locations is found to be higher than the global average. For precipitation, a complex and inconsistent response with considerable variation in the sign and magnitude of change is observed. Future projections show significant warming. Climate-driven changes and impacts are clearly observed. Snow cover has declined since the 1960s, with an enhanced decreasing trend during the 1990s and variable trends since 2000. Glaciers are losing mass and retreating at varying rates since the early 20th century, with an exception over the Karakoram region. An observed heterogeneous response of glaciers to atmospheric warming is controlled by regional variations in topography, debris cover, circulation and precipitation. Initial assessments of permafrost extent of 1 million km(2) across the IHR roughly translate into 14 times the glacier area. Extreme floods represent the most frequent natural disaster in the IHR. Studies have highlighted the significant threat from glacial lakes. Landslides occur in combination with heavy rainfall and flooding, with poor land- use practices such as road-cutting and deforestation being additional drivers. Climate change has also stressed traditional subsistence agriculture and food systems. Improving systematic and coordinated monitoring of climate and related impacts is crucial to contribute to effective climate change adaptation and response strategies.yy					Bolch, Tobias/ABE-6635-2020; Thayyen, Renoj/AAR-8636-2020; Bolch, Tobias/A-1935-2008; Maharana, Pyarimohan/Q-4121-2018; Pandey, Ashish/O-9479-2018; Cánovas, Juan/ABG-7903-2020; Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017	Bolch, Tobias/0000-0002-8201-5059; Ballesteros Canovas, Juan A./0000-0003-4439-397X; Dimri, A P/0000-0002-7832-8669; Maharana, Pyarimohan/0000-0003-3175-8714; 													0011-3891					MAR 10	2021	120	5					774	790		10.18520/cs/v120/i5/774-790	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v120/i5/774-790													WOS:000626722900022

The relationship between environmental variables and population variation of phytoplankton was discussed. The results showed that water body morphology was the key factor leading to the variation of phytoplankton community. In river-type waters the level of phytoplankton biomass was generally higher than that in lake-type waters, especially in summer. During the period of seasonal change, in river-type waters Cyanophyta dominated longer with the succession from Cyanophyta to Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta occurred later than that in lake-type waters. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the morphology of enclosed waters had influence on phytoplankton biomass and species composition. One of the mechanisms may be that water body morphology could have impact on the growth and species dynamics of phytoplankton indirectly by affecting nutrient concentrations.

There is no consensus on its native status in North America; published sources treat it as either exotic or native. We examined the locations and habitats of early collections of reed canarygrass in the inland Northwest in the context of Euro-American settlement and early agronomic research. Early collectors found P. arundinacea along streams, lake margins, springs, and meadows. This species predates agronomic trials in the United States and was collected in remote areas before settlement. Modern populations of reed canarygrass may be a mixture of agronomic cultivars and native material.																			0885-8608					JUL	1998	18	3					223	230																WOS:000075183900004

The most abundant of these organisms is a new cyanobacterium, D. salina. It was isolated and grown in a defined culture meidum, and its biology was studied in the lake throughout 2 annual periods of stratification. Dactylococcopsis dominated the lake plankton between depths of 1 and 4 m during Dec. 1979 to April 1980 but disappeared during summer holomixis. It reappeared in Nov. and persisted through to May 1981, but during this 2nd period of stratification it was distributed only in a narrow band around a depth of 1 m. By determining the physical and chemical requirements of Dactylococcopsis in culture it was possible to explain the changes in its abundance and vertical distribution in the lake as follows. Salinity provides no barrier to its distribution as it is able to grow over a wider range, 5-20%, than that encountered in the lake. The cyanobacterium is killed by prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 46.degree. C. This temperature was exceeded at depths below 1.5 m as the lake heated up in April 1980 and at depths below 2 m throughout the Nov. 1980 to May 1981 period of stratification: Dactylococcopsis was absent from these layers. While the Dactylococcopsis is able to photosynthesize under anaerobic conditions in the presence of sulfide, its efficiency is < 4% of the aerobic rate. Its inability to compete effectively with other photosynthetic microorganisms in the presence of sulfide may explain its absence from depths below 4 m during the winter of 1980. Dactylococcopsis is able to adapt to very high light intensities. The natural population has a photosynthetic Ik of 900 .mu.E [Einsteins] m-2 s-1 and it survives light intensities of 800 .mu.E m-2 s-1 for prolonged periods. However, the combination of even higher intensities and high O2 concentrations at the lake surface may contribute to its absence there. The absence of Dactylococcopsis from the top 0.7 m of the lake can be explained by grazing pressure from Artemia salina, the brine shrimp. The shrimp effectively filters the cyanobacterium from the epilimnetic water and is able to assimilate it. Artemia is unable to graze the metalimnetic population during stratification because it cannot withstand the elevated temperatures there. Dactylococcopsis resides in the stratified metalimnion for many months. Losses by sinking, or floating, are minimized by light intensity-regulated buoyancy control in which gas vacuoles provide an essential part.					van Rijn, Jaap/Q-5254-2017	van Rijn, Jaap/0000-0002-9680-2133													0080-4649						1983	217	1209					417	+		10.1098/rspb.1983.0019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1983.0019													WOS:A1983QH73800005

Isolation basin records of late Quaternary sea-level change, central mainland British Columbia, Canada	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Isolation basin records from the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex, a remote area of central mainland British Columbia, Canada are used to constrain post-glacial sea-level changes and provide a preliminary basis for testing geophysical model predictions of relative sea-level (RSL) change. Sedimentological and diatom data from three low-lying (<4 m elevation) basins record falling RSLs in late-glacial times and isolation from the sea by similar to 11,800-11,200 C-14 BP. A subsequent RSL rise during the early Holocene (similar to 8000 C-14 BP) breached the 2.13 m sill of the lowest basin (Woods Lake), but the two more elevated basins (sill elevations of similar to 3.6 m) remained isolated. At similar to 2400 C-14 BP, RSL stood at 1.49 +/- 034 m above present MTL. Falling RSLs in the late Holocene led to the final emergence of the Woods Lake basin by 1604 36 14C BP. Model predictions generated using the ICE-5G model partnered with a small number of different Earth viscosity models generally show poor agreement with the observational data, indicating that the ice model and/or Earth models considered can be improved upon. The best data-model fits were achieved with relatively low values of upper mantle viscosity (5 x 10(19) Pa s), which is consistent with previous modelling results from the region. The RSL data align more closely with observational records from the southeast of the region (eastern Vancouver Island, central Strait of Georgia), than the immediate north (Bella Bella-Bella Coola and Prince Rupert-Kitimat) and areas to the north-west (Queen Charlotte Sound, Hecate Strait), underlining the complexity of the regional response to glacio-isostatic recovery.

While the Water Quality Index (WQI) is commonly employed to evaluate surface water quality, it fails to consider biodiversity and does not fully capture the ecological health of rivers. Here we show a comprehensive assessment of the ecological health of surface water in the lower Yangtze River (LYR), integrating chemical and biological metrics. According to traditional WQI metrics, the LYR's surface water generally meets China's Class II standards. However, it also contains 43 high-risk emerging contaminants; nitrobenzenes are found at the highest concentrations, representing 25-90% of total detections, while polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present the most substantial environmental risks, accounting for 81-93% of the total risk quotient. Notably, the plankton-based index of biological integrity (P-IBI) rates the ecological health of the majority of LYR water samples (59.7%) as 'fair', with significantly better health observed in autumn compared to other seasons (p < 0.01). Our findings suggest that including emerging contaminants and P-IBI as additional metrics can enhance the traditional WQI analysis in evaluating surface water's ecological health. These results highlight the need for a multidimensional assessment approach and call for improvements to LYR's ecological health, focusing on emerging contaminants and biodiversity rather than solely on reducing conventional indicators.

Lake responses to long-term hypolimnetic withdrawal treatments	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT					25th International Symposium of the North-American-Lake-Management-Society	NOV, 2005	Madison, WI	N Amer Lake Management Soc				Hypolimnetic withdrawal is an in-lake restoration technique based on the selective discharge of bottom water to enhance the removal of nutrients and electro-chemically reduced substances that build up when the hypolimnion becomes anoxic. Comparison of water quality variables before and during treatment in about 40 European and 8 North American lakes indicates that hypolimnetic withdrawal is an efficient restoration technique in stratified lakes. Water quality improvement was apparent in decreased summer average epilimnetic phosphorus (P) and chlorophyll concentrations, increased Secchi disk transparency, and decreased hypolimnetic phosphorus concentration and anoxia. In particular, summer average phosphorus decreases were significantly correlated with annual water volumes and P masses withdrawn per lake area, indicating the importance of hydrology and timing of the treatment. Observations as well as models revealed that avoiding extreme temperature changes in the water column is critical for a successful application of the technique. The removal of colder bottom water may increase bottom water temperatures, which not only increases sediment release rates and sediment oxygen demand but, more important, may lead to thermal instability, resulting in enhanced entrainment of nutrient-rich hypolimnetic water and increased surface eutrophication. Hypolimnetic withdrawal also improved water quality in man-made lakes with bottom outlets unless too much withdrawal led to thermal instability. It failed to have a positive effect in a shallow oligomictic lake, probably because nutrient export was not much increased. A recognized disadvantage of hypolimnetic withdrawal is its impact on downstream waters, including eutrophication, temperature increase, oxygen depletion, and odor development. In the experiences evaluated, treatment of the withdrawal water ranged from no treatment in older remote applications in the European Alps, to passive treatment in wetlands and settling ponds, and modem waste water technologies in more recent applications. Overall, hypolimnetic withdrawal is an effective low-cost restoration technique to combat and potentially reverse eutrophication in stratified lakes and reservoirs.

We verified the absence of Tropilaelaps spp., the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), and slow bee paralysis virus. Endemic health threats were quantified, including Varroa destructor, Nosema spp., and eight honey bee viruses. Varroa loads varied across years, with annual fall peaks; Nosema peaked January to April. Migratory beekeepers had significantly lower Varroa prevalence (84.9 vs. 97.0 %) and loads (3.65 +/- 0.28 vs. 5.99 +/- 0.22) than stationary operations, while Nosema was more prevalent (59.9 vs. 46.7 %) in migratory colonies. Since 2010, chronic bee paralysis virus prevalence doubled annually. We detected strong positive relationships between V. destructor and Varroa -transmitted viruses, between Nosema and Lake Sinai virus 2, and a positive relationship across several viral pathogens of bees. The results provide a disease baseline to help identify drivers of poor bee health.					; Traynor, Kirsten/GWC-1553-2022; vanEngelsdorp, Dennis/E-7934-2010; Evans, Jay/C-8408-2012	Traynor, Kirsten/0000-0002-0848-4607; Evans, Jay/0000-0002-0036-4651													0044-8435	1297-9678				MAY	2016	47	3					325	347		10.1007/s13592-016-0431-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-016-0431-0													WOS:000379000100004

Influence of chemical and biological parameters on iron and manganese accumulation in water distribution networks	12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING AND CONTROL FOR THE WATER INDUSTRY, CCWI2013	Procedia Engineering				12th International Conference on Computing-and-Control-for-the-Water-Industry (CCWI)	SEP 02-04, 2013	Perugia, ITALY	Comp & Control Water Ind				The occurrence of discoloured water at the customers' tap is a great worry for water companies throughout the world. Customers' express their dissatisfaction when their tap water discolour. This greatly undermines their confidence in water companies. This discolouration is mainly caused by increased levels of Fe and Mn accumulation. This paper presents analysis of a six-year dataset comprising of 36 water quality parameters and customer complaints data covering 176 different district metered areas (DMAs) to identify relevant parameters that influence Iron (Fe) and Manganese (Mn) accumulation potential. Customer complaints data were also investigated for seasonal trends. From the analysis of the data, it was observed that of the 36 parameters only few parameters such as those related to bio-chemical oxidation and sorption significantly influenced the accumulation of Fe and Mn. Majority of the DMAs showed significantly high peaks of customer complaints during summer. These spikes may be attributed to increased water consumption and warmer water temperatures during this period. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Many extremophiles have been greatly explored for their application in various industrial processes.

Spiraling Down Hillslopes: Nutrient Uptake from Water Tracks in a Warming Arctic	ECOSYSTEMS												Hydrologic flowpaths might propagate biogeochemical signals among connected ecosystems or alter and dampen signals because of reactions or retention occurring during transport. In the Arctic, experimentally warmed terrestrial tundra releases inorganic nitrogen (N), but the fate of this newly released N remains unclear. Nitrogen could be passively transported downslope in flowing water, or retained when flowpaths intercept N-limited ecosystems. We applied nutrient spiraling theory to simultaneously measure reaction and transport of ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-), nutrients limiting primary productivity in Arctic ecosystems. Pulse fertilization experiments were focused on flowpaths known as water tracks that hydrologically connect soils to receiving streams and lakes in upland tundra of Alaska. Water tracks typically retained PO43-, but passively transported NH4+, thus potentially propagating NH4+ produced by warming tundra soils to downstream ecosystems. Nutrient uptake was uncorrelated with the relative proportion of downslope transport in transient storage zones, but greater NH4+ uptake occurred as advective hydrologic flux increased relative to dispersion. Phosphate uptake declined as thaw depth increased over the summer season likely because of declining capacity for biotic uptake or sorption in deeper soils. Phosphorus limitation in fluvial ecosystems of the Arctic might result in efficient transport of inorganic N to N-limited lentic and coastal ecosystems, where increasing subsidies furnished by N loss from warming terrestrial tundra could support enhanced primary production.

Because this lahar may have been generated by water released from within these craters, we refer to this lahar as a "syneruptive-spouted type lahar" in this study. The lahar of the 2014 eruption was small relative to the other syneruptive type lahars reported in the past that were snowmelt type or crater lake breakout type lahars. Nevertheless, in the 2014 event, the syneruptive-spouted type lahar extended approximately 5 km downstream from the Jigokudani crater via the Akagawa River, with an estimated total volume of similar to 1.2 x 10(5) m(3). We have reviewed other representative syneruptive-spouted type lahars that have been reported in Japan. The syneruptive-spouted type lahar attributed to the September 2014 eruption had the longest runout distance and largest volume of all cases studied. The mineral assemblage identified from samples of the lahar deposits is similar to that of ash-fall deposits from the same eruption. Previous workers deduced that the ash was derived mainly from shallow depths (within 2 km of the surface). The syneruptive-spouted type lahar deposits are therefore also considered to have originated from shallow depths. A syneruptive-spouted type lahar is a small-scale phenomenon that causes little direct damage to infrastructure, but has long-term influence on water quality. Increases in turbidity and decreases in pH are expected to occur in the Mount Ontake area downstream of Nigorisawa after heavy rainfall events in the future. Therefore, the potential indirect (but long term) damage of syneruptive-spouted type lahars should be considered for hazard mapping and planning volcanic disaster prevention measures.

Part I: Sedimentology and major element geochemistry	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES												The 150-m-thick Kuetsjarvi Sedimentary Formation (KSF) from the Pechenga Greenstone Belt, NW Russia, is one of the key formations in the study of a positive delta(13)C(carb) excursion occurring globally in the Palaeoproterozoic. The KSF formed in an intracratonic rift setting and is sandwiched between two, 2-km-thick subaerially erupted volcanic units. The KSF was previously interpreted as shallow marine, but new data reported here indicate that it is a non-marine unit deposited on a deeply subaerially weathered surface mantling the underlying volcanic rocks. The lowermost part of the KSF represents an alluvial-fluvial plain, followed by a laterally and vertically variable succession of variegated to mottled fine-grained siliciclastic rocks and 'red beds', dolostones containing stromatolite sheets, hydrothermal travertine deposits and abundant desiccation features (e.g. tepees, surfical silicified crusts and dissolution cavities), including probable pseudomorphed evaporites. Measured S and C-org concentrations for the carbonate and siliciclastic rocks are low. Combined, these features indicate that the carbonate rocks of the KSF accumulated in a shallow lacustrine setting. Major types of carbonate facies were formed by: (1) biologically-induced precipitation; (2) evaporitic removal of CO2 in a closed lake environment; and (3) chemical precipitation from thermal springs. Apparently, none of these carbonate facies was in full isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. This interpretation shows the importance of taking into account the interplay between global and local depositional factors when interpreting the isotopic signature of the KSF dolostones and its implication for the Palaeoproterozoic carbon isotope excursion.					; Fallick, Anthony/MGB-3739-2025	Fallick, Anthony/0000-0002-7649-6167; 													0263-5933						2004	95		3-4				393	421																WOS:000229929000001

Effects of an Experimental Water-level Drawdown on Methane Emissions from a Eutrophic Reservoir	ECOSYSTEMS												Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, emission rate estimates may be biased low due to inadequate monitoring during brief periods of elevated emission rates (that is, hot moments). Here we investigate CH4 bubbling (that is, ebullition) during periods of falling water levels in a eutrophic reservoir in the Midwestern USA. We hypothesized that periods of water-level decline trigger the release of CH4-rich bubbles from the sediments and that these emissions constitute a substantial fraction of the annual CH4 flux. We explored this hypothesis by monitoring CH4 ebullition in a eutrophic reservoir over a 7-month period, which included an experimental water-level drawdown. We found that the ebullitive CH4 flux rate was among the highest ever reported for a reservoir (mean = 32.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). The already high ebullitive flux rates increased by factors of 1.4-77 across the nine monitoring sites during the 24-h experimental water-level drawdown, but these emissions constituted only 3% of the CH4 flux during the 7-month monitoring period due to the naturally high ebullitive CH4 flux rates that persist throughout the warm weather season. Although drawdown emissions were found to be a minor component of annual CH4 emissions in this reservoir, our findings demonstrate a link between water-level change and CH4 ebullition, suggesting that CH4 emissions may be mitigated through water-level management in some reservoirs.					; Nietch, Christopher/HLH-8388-2023; Walker, John/I-8880-2014; Harrison, John/F-2280-2011; Nietch, Christopher/AAF-2543-2020	Waldo, Sarah/0000-0002-0185-1312; Nietch, Christopher/0000-0002-6265-7070; Walker, John/0000-0001-6034-7514; Harrison, John/0000-0002-0677-5478; Platz, Michelle/0000-0002-3295-8112													1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2018	21	4					657	674		10.1007/s10021-017-0176-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0176-2								31007569					WOS:000433955800006

Gomphonema lateripunctatum was particularly notable. Other diatoms were occasionally abundant, including Cyclotella ocellata, Aulacoseria distans, Cymbella affinis, C ventricosa and Navicula halophila. Fragilaria ulna and Gomphonema ventricosum were conspicuous, owing to their large size, but never numerically abundant. Cluster analysis was applied to the epiphytic algae community. The seasonal variations of the samples were classified according to their similarity levels. Samples were collected, species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, H') were measured monthly.

J	Cakir, M; Aydin, A; Campagna, DJ				Cakir, M; Aydin, A; Campagna, DJ			Deformation pattern around the conjoining strike-slip fault systems in the Basin and Range, southeast Nevada: The role of strike-slip faulting in basin formation and inversion	TECTONICS												Within the extensional regime of the Basin and Range, strike-slip faults create a regional pattern of opposing sense of fault systems. The relationship between these faults and other deformational features nearby is enigmatic. This paper addresses a diverse assemblage of contractional and extensional structures reflecting local uplift and subsidence, respectively, at the junction of two large Neogene strike-slip faults in southeastern Nevada, the right-lateral Las Vegas Valley shear zone and the left-lateral Bitter Spring Valley fault of the Lake Mead fault system. First, a middle Miocene lacustrine carbonate basin, the Bitter Ridge-Lovell Wash carbonate basin, formed north of the strike-slip faults. Second, the lacustrine basin inverted locally, while sediments accumulated south of the strike-slip faults. Third, the study area was deformed by north-northeast trending, high-angle oblique faults with normal and left-slip components. The results, both from field observations and numerical modeling of the intersecting strike-slip faults, show that the Las Vegas Valley sheer zone and the Bitter Spring Valley fault may have produced the basin in the north and its intense contractional deformation as well as the southward shift of deposition during the inversion event. We conclude that conjoining strike-slip fault systems can promote localized vertical tectonics and lead to basin formation and uplift right next to each other. Subsequent inversion of the earlier basinal deposits, however, requires a reversal in the sense of slip across the Las Vegas Valley shear zone and a change in the regional stress system.

Lake-atmosphere interactions at Alqueva reservoir: a case study in the summer of 2014	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The study of lake-atmosphere interactions was the main purpose of a 2014 summer experiment at Alqueva reservoir in Portugal. Near-surface fluxes of momentum, heat and mass [water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)] were obtained with the new Campbell Scientific's IRGASON Integrated Open-Path CO2/H2O Gas Analyser and 3D Sonic Anemometer between 2 June and 2 October. On average, the reservoir was releasing energy in the form of sensible and latent heat flux during the study period. At the end of the 75 d, the total evaporation was estimated as 490.26 mm. A high correlation was found between the latent heat flux and the wind speed (R = 0.97). The temperature gradient between air and water was positive between 12 and 21 UTC, causing a negative sensible heat flux, and negative during the rest of the day, triggering a positive sensible heat flux. The reservoir acted as a sink of atmospheric CO2 with an average rate of -0.026 mg m(-2) s(-1). However, at a daily scale we found an unexpected uptake between 0 and 9 UTC and almost null flux between 13 and 19 UTC. Potential reasons for this result are further discussed. The net radiation was recorded for the same period and water column heat storage was estimated using water temperature profiles. The energy balance closure for the analysed period was 81%. In-water solar spectral downwelling irradiance profiles were measured with a new device allowing measurements independent of the solar zenith angle, which enabled the computation of the attenuation coefficient of light in the water column. The average attenuation coefficient for the photosynthetically active radiation spectral region varied from 0.849 +/- 0.025 m(-1) on 30 July to 1.459 +/- 0.007 m(-1) on 25 September.

It is shown that the highest temperatures of those sediments are reached in autumn when near-bottom waters are involved with the processes of the gravitational mixing of the water column. Mixing conditions of the water column were estimated using additional information on the vertical profiles of standard water variables (pH, oxygen concentration, and conductivity). It is shown that depending on the amount of heat stored in the sediments of the deep bottom areas and the thermodynamic processes of its redistribution, the lake may be designated "super-warm" or "moderately-warm." This implies that existing thermal classification of lakes is too formal and does not account for the complexity of thermodynamic processes of heat redistribution. Measurement data is evidence of the implication of the inflows from the bottom-feeding sources in the formation of the highly mineralized near-bottom water layer in those bottom areas.

Gut contents of larvar collected monthly from 16 stations in the lake were analyzed. Quantitative samples of water collected monthly at the mud-water interface at each station were analyzed for the larval food composition in the water. The larvae fed primarily on Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Blue-green algae were predominant in the water as well as in the larval guts, forming 63-87% and 52-84% of the total organisms observed in the water and in the larval guts, respectively. Populations of these organisms in the water were lowest in the summer. A highly significant relationship existed between the monthly mean percent of blue-green algae in the larvae and in the water. In general, the larvae were nonselective feeders in that the organisms enumerated in the water were also found in the gut.

Utilization of shrimp waste as a respiration substrate by planktonic and benthic microorganisms	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												This study presents results of research on the number of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi in water and bottom sediments of Lake Chelmzynskie and their role in the decomposition of chitin. The authors also examined the level of respiration activity of water and sediment microorganisms in the presence of shrimp waste. Results demonstrate that the number of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi in water and bottom sediments were variable. The analyzed groups of microorganisms predominated in bottom sediments with the number of heterotrophic bacteria significantly exceeding that of fungi. The proportion of microorganisms capable of decomposing chitin was greater among fungi than among heterotrophic bacteria. In water chitinolytic bacteria constituted 11-19% of the total number of heterotrophic bacteria and in bottom sediments only 3-8%. Chitinolytic fungi constituted 17-67% and dominated in water. In the presence of shrimp waste, the level of respiration activity of microorganisms in water and bottom sediments of Lake Chelmzynskie clearly depended on examined factors. The temperature, incubation time, and type of respiration substrate had a statistically significant impact on this activity. The highest respiration activity (2.4-90.3 mg O-2 center dot dm(-3)) of aquatic microorganisms was recorded in the summer, when the water temperature equaled 24 degrees C. In bottom sediments the highest values of respiration activity also were observed in summer (13.4-447.4 mg O-2 g(-1)dry mass) but alkaline sediments were characterized by higher activity levels. Benthic and planktonic microorganisms were utilizing shrimp heads most effectively and the exoskeletons least effectively.

J	Scholten, GD; Bettoli, PW				Scholten, GD; Bettoli, PW			Population characteristics and assessment of overfishing for an exploited paddlefish population in the lower Tennessee River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Paddlefish Polyodon spathula (n = 576) were collected from Kentucky Lake, Kentucky-Tennessee, with experimental gill nets in 2003-2004 to assess population characteristics and the potential for commercial overfishing. Additional data were collected from 1,039 paddlefish caught by commercial gillnetters in this impoundment. Since the most recent study in 1991, sire and age structure have been reduced and annual mortality has tripled. In the 1991 study, 37% of the fish collected were older than the maximum age we observed (age 11), and in 2003 annual mortality for paddlefish age 7 and older was high (A = 68%). Natural mortality is presumably low ( < 10%) for paddlefish; therefore, exploitation in recent years is high. Estimates of total annual mortality were negatively related to river discharge in the years preceding each estimate. The number of paddlefish harvested since 1999 was also negatively related to river discharge because gill nets cannot be easily deployed when discharge exceeds approximately 850 m(3)/s. Large females spawn annually because all females longer than 1,034 turn eye-fork length (EFL) were gravid. No mature females were protected by the current 864-mm minimum EFL limit. At a low natural mortality rate, higher size limits when exploitation was high (40-70%) increased simulated flesh yields by 10-20%. Even at low levels of exploitation (21%), spawning potential ratios (SPRs) under the current 864-mm minimum EFL size limit fell below 20%. If the size limit was raised to 1,016 mm EFL, the population could withstand up to 62% exploitation before the SPR falls below 20%. An analysis of annual mortality caps indicated that the best way to increase the average size of harvested fish is to increase the minimum size limit. Recruitment overfishing probably occurs during drought years; however, variation in river discharge has prevented the population from being exploited at unsustainable rates in the past.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2005	134	5					1285	1298		10.1577/T04-161.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T04-161.1													WOS:000232737300019

For this purpose, samples were collected from eight sampling stations in March and September from the surface water. 34 taxa, from 8 divisions were categorized as Bacillariophyta (17), Charophyta (2), Chlorophyta (5), Cryptophyta (1), Cyanobacteria (5), Euglenozoa (2), Miozoa (1) and Ochrophyta (1). The habitat of blue-green algae Anabaena spiroides (Klebahn), which was found to be dominant in Lake Terkos, was identified as eutrophic as well as stratified signifying shallow lakes with low nitrogen content. Recording high reproduction of Anabaena spiroides particularly in autumn demonstrated that the characteristics of the lake was altering from mesotrophic to eutrophic. The measured heavy metal concentrations denote that the Lake Terkos was extremely polluted by some metals/ metalloids. Particularly boron (B) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations show a class of 4 water quality. Since it fulfills the demand for drinking water in Istanbul to a large extent, it is crucial to take measures to improve the water quality of Lake Terkos urgently. Also it is considered that, limnological monitoring studies must be carried out continuously at the lake for controlling the water quality.

Spatial and temporal occurrence of the salmonid parasite Ceratomyxa shasta in the Oregon-California Klamath River basin	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												The parasite Ceratomyxa shasta has been implicated as a significant source of salmonid mortality in the lower Klamath River, California (i.e., below Iron Gate dam). A study of the prevalence of C. shasta and its geographic and temporal distribution throughout the Klamath River basin was conducted to determine when and where juvenile salmonids encounter lethal parasite doses. Susceptible rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were exposed to C. shasta 3-4 d at seven locations in the Klamath River between Beaver Creek and Keno Reservoir in April, June, July, September, and November 2003. Individuals from a Klamath River strain of fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were held in three locations in the upper Klamath River in April, June, and July. In June 2004, rainbow trout were exposed to the parasite for 4 d at 18 locations from Klamath Lake to the mouth of the Klamath River, including several major spawning tributaries; one exposure occurred in the lower Klamath River. Rainbow trout mortality due to infection for groups exposed in the upper Klamath River was lower (< 8.0%) and delayed (mean time to death, 40-110 d) in comparison with that in groups exposed in the lower Klamath River (> 98%; mean time to death, 33-36 d). Experimental fall Chinook salmon did not become infected in the upper Klamath River, but infection was detected in Chinook salmon exposed in the lower Klamath River, nearly 50% of these succumbing to infection. These dramatic differences in mortality between the upper and lower Klamath River could not be explained by differences in water temperatures during exposure and are probably a result of differences in infectious dose. Lack of infection in groups exposed in tributaries supports the hypothesis that the parasite life cycle and the invertebrate host are largely confined to the main-stem Klamath River.

The artificial circulation system resulted in an overall reduction in the physical stability of the water column, making the lake subject to alternating periods of weak chemical stratification and mixing. Phytoplankton community succession exhibited a high degree of regularity from year to year, culminating in mid summer dominance by heterocystous cyanophytes in all years. Changes in the physical structure of the water column, with attendant changes in Z(eu):Z(mix), were not important determinants of phytoplankton community makeup in East Sidney Lake. Seasonal patterns and community characteristics were not affected by artificially induced alterations in stability, but instead were most sensitive to surface temperatures, flushing rate and TN:TP. The timing of cyanophyte blooms was not affected by artificial circulation, nor was maximum seasonal phytoplankton biomass reduced.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 20	1996	331	1-3					109	120		10.1007/BF00025412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025412													WOS:A1996VR83900011

This study provides discussion on the emergence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in lakes. The correlation of critical water quality parameters with antibiotics and ARGs are evaluated along with their integrative potential ecological risk. Sulfonamides (similar to 67.18 ng/L) and quinolones (similar to 77.62 ng/L) were the dominant antibiotics distributed in the aqueous phase, while the quinolones and tetracyclines were the primary contamination factors in the sediment phase. The temporal and spatial distribution revealed that the antibiotic concentrations were significantly lower in summer than other seasons and the lakes in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces exhibited the highest antibiotic pollution. The detection frequency and relative abundance of sul1 gene have been the highest among all detected ARGs. Moreover, ARGs in lakes were driven by several factors, with bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements that prevailed the positive distribution of ARGs. Antibiotics have been identified as critical factors in inducing the propagation of ARGs, which could be further enhanced by chemical contaminants (e.g., heavy metals and nutrients). Involving the risk assessment strategies, research attention should be paid on three antibiotics (ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin) to strengthen the policy and management of Baiyangdian Lake and East Dongting Lake. This review analysis will provide in-depth understanding to the researchers and policy-makers in formulation of strategies for remediation of antibiotic contamination in the lakes.

Such maxima occur regularly in Lake Stechlin, mainly contributed by the cyanobacterial species Cyanobium sp. and occasionally by Planktothrix rubescens. In the early twenty-first century, a rapid invasion by nostocalean cyanobacteria occurred in the lake and a number of Dolichospermum species together with Aphanizomenon flos-aquae appeared. As revealed by both microscopic and fluorimetric methods, during the summer stratification of 2013, a multispecific DCM was formed by Cyanobium, Planktothrix rubescens, and A. flos-aquae, however with spatial segregation. Planktothrix occurred in the upper hypolimnion, Aphanizomenon and Cyanobium dominated in the metalimnetic layer. Coexistence of these three cyanoprokaryota is possibly the consequence of different environmental factors limiting them (light, availability of N and P). This study represents a rare case when spatial niche segregation of phytoplankton species occurs in close to equilibrium conditions. DCM formed by Aphanizomenon and Cyanobium was detected by the fluoroprobe; Planktothrix with its different pigment compositions remained largely hidden. Our results indicate the necessity of parallel microscopic investigations and the need of careful calibration when fluorimetric methods are used for detecting cyanobacterial populations.

Acid rain recovery may help to mitigate the impacts of climate change on thermally sensitive fish in lakes across eastern North America	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												From the 1970s to 1990s, more stringent air quality regulations were implemented across North America and Europe to reduce chemical emissions that contribute to acid rain. Surface water pH slowly increased during the following decades, but biological recovery lagged behind chemical recovery. Fortunately, this situation is changing. In the past few years, northeastern US fish populations have begun to recover in lakes that were historically incapable of sustaining wild fish due to acidic conditions. As lake ecosystems across the eastern United States recover from acid deposition, the stress to the most susceptible populations of native coldwater fish appears to be shifting from acidification effects to thermal impacts associated with changing climate. Extreme summer temperature events - which are expected to occur with increasing frequency in the coming century - can stress and ultimately kill native coldwater fish in lakes where thermal stratification is absent or highly limited. Based on data from northeastern North America, we argue that recovery from acid deposition has the potential to improve the resilience of coldwater fish populations in some lakes to impacts of climate change. This will occur as the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water increases with increasing lake pH. Increased DOC will reduce water clarity and lead to shallower and more persistent lake thermoclines that can provide larger areas of coldwater thermal refuge habitat. Recovery from acidification will not eliminate the threat of climate change to coldwater fish, but secondary effects of acid recovery may improve the resistance of coldwater fish populations in lakes to the effects of elevated summer temperatures in historically acidified ecosystems. This analysis highlights the importance of considering the legacy of past ecosystem impacts and how recovery or persistence of those effects may interact with climate change impacts on biota in the coming decades.					; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Warren, Dana/G-5600-2012	Warren, Dana/0000-0001-5282-7972; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2017	23	6					2149	2153		10.1111/gcb.13568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13568								27976837					WOS:000400445900002
J	Bussières, N				Bussières, N			Thermal features of the Mackenzie basin from NOAA AVHRR observations for summer 1994	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												A series of mid-afternoon Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal radiance scenes were assembled in order to develop a better understanding of the complex energy and water processes leading to variations in surface temperature. An in-depth knowledge of the temperature variability is of interest to land surface process modelling and its application to the Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Study (MAGS). Clear-sky land surface temperatures are estimated by applying a split window technique to remove atmospheric effects. A maximum land surface temperature map of the Mackenzie basin at 1-km scale for summer 1994 is produced. The patterns are related to land surface features and elevation. The basin's maximum land surface temperature patterns can be subdivided into three land zones (greater than or equal to35degreesC, 33-34degreesC and 27-32degreesC) and a water dominated zone (20.5degreesC on average). The highest maximum temperature zone (greater than or equal to35degreesC) corresponds to a combination of minimal vegetation, drier soils and low terrain. This zone is not in the southern part of the basin as might be speculated in the absence of these data, but in a wide low elevation corridor from west of Great Bear Lake along the Mackenzie River down to 50degreesN, 120degreesW. The maximum land surface temperatures tend to decrease with increasing vegetation density and surface moisture; they also decrease with elevation at a rate of -4.5degreesC km(-1). This is confirmed by weather station data. The AVHRR data extend this relationship to the 1200-2200 m altitude ranges, where there are no station data. The data suggest that elevation and land cover should be taken into account in the objective analysis (spatial interpolation) of station data.																			0705-5900					JUN	2002	40	2					233	244		10.3137/ao.400210	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.400210													WOS:000176257600011

From cold to cool in northernmost Norway: Lateglacial and early Holocene multi-proxy environmental and climate reconstructions from Jansvatnet, Hammerfest	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A multi-proxy palaeoecological study of the lateglacial and early Holocene sediments of Jansvatnet, Hammerfest, northernmost Norway (70 degrees 39' N) showed that cold and arid conditions prevailed in both the lateglacial interstadial and the Younger Dryas. Terrestrial proxies are macrofossils and pollen. Aquatic proxies are plant and invertebrate macrofossils, pollen, diatoms, and chironomids. Mean July temperatures were reconstructed using pollen and chironomid calibration functions and ecological knowledge of the fossil flora and fauna. Lake-water pH was reconstructed using a diatom pH-calibration function. Above sterile basal deglacial silts, biotic activity was detected around 14600 years ago in the interstadial (chronologically equivalent to the Bolling-Allerod in the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology). Catchment vegetation resembled polar desert and ultra-cold stenothermic chironomids lived in the lake. However, diatom assemblages were diverse and dynamic. In the Younger Dryas stadial, conditions deteriorated. In the early Younger Dryas chironomid-inferred air temperatures (CI-Tjul) fell about 1 C. Pollen-inferred temperatures (PI-Tjul) did not fall and the terrestrial vegetation hardly changed because of the extreme aridity. The lake water was turbid from suspended clay which diminished aquatic life. Later in the Younger Dryas (ca 12400 cal yr BP) reconstructed mean July temperatures fell by a further 3 degrees C and were close to the minimum to support life, at around 3-4 degrees C. However, decreased turbidity allowed moss growth on the lake bottom that provided habitats for invertebrates and diatoms. In the last 200 years of the Younger Dryas temperatures increased by 2-3 degrees C and terrestrial and aquatic organisms responded quickly. At the start of the Holocene a rapid increase of more than 3 C in PI-Tjul to 9.5 degrees C initiated the replacement of sparse arctic tundra by low-arctic dwarf-shrub heath. Simultaneously, a further 2 degrees C increase in CI-Tjul to 10-11 degrees C reflected a regime shift in the lake. Aquatic macrophytes rapidly replaced the moss carpet, diatom assemblages stabilised and diatom plankton developed, and cold stenotherm chironomids were replaced by cool-temperate taxa. Productivity increased as CI-Tjul reached a steady maximum of around 12 degrees C and PI-Tjul reached 10.5 degrees C at about 10000 cal yr BR At this time, tree-birch arrived and woodland developed over the catchment. Birch could have immigrated from the south up the west coast or from the east along the Barents Sea coast. Acidophilous aquatic taxa increased as diatom-inferred pH gradually decreased from 7.3 to 6.6. After ca 9380 cal yr BP, the density and extent of birch woodland decreased and species of exposed rocky areas increased, reflecting increased windiness, precipitation, and possibly a small decrease in July temperatures. Birch now formed the arctic tree-line at Jansvatnet. The lateglacial climatic pattern at Jansvatnet resembles patterns detected elsewhere in northern Norway and Svalbard and in marine records from the Norwegian and Barents Seas but contrasts with patterns in southern Norway.

UVR-induced photosynthetic inhibition dominates over DNA damage in marine dinoflagellates exposed to fluctuating solar radiation regimes	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The combined effect of solar radiation (UV-B (280-315 nm), UWA (315-400 nm) and PAR (400-700 nm)) and vertical mixing (i.e., fluctuating radiation regimes) on the marine dinoflagellates Gymnodinium chlorophorum, Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum micans was investigated during the austral spring in Patagonia, Argentina. Photosynthesis, measured as radiocarbon incorporation, and accumulation of DNA damage, as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), were investigated under simulated mixed and non-mixed water column conditions using 3 h incubations centered at local noon. Static samples had significant UVR-induced photoinhibition that was higher in H. triquetra as compared to the other two species. Increasing mixing speed significantly increased UVR-induced inhibition of carbon fixation in G. chlorophorum and H. triquetra. No significant UVR effect was observed in R micans under any of the mixing regimes. Most of the loss in carbon fixation in G. chlorophorum was due to UV-B while in H. triquetra it was due to UV-A. Part of these responses may be associated to the presence of UV-absorbing compounds which were abundant in P. micans, and low in H. triquetra and in G. chlorophorum. However, other variables such as cell size and active repair might have also influenced our results. We did not detect CPD accumulation in any of the species, probably because of the low solar angle that resulted in very low levels of DNA effective UV-B dose. Our results indicate that exposure to solar UVR in the Patagonia area during spring time (even during ozone depletion events) has a clear impact on photosynthesis and much less or negligible on DNA in the three studied species.

Determination of dichlorvos pesticide residues in the groundwater of the environment surrounding Al-Sin Lake using a high-performance liquid chromatography	ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT												The unreasonable use of agrochemicals and various human activities in the environment of Al-Sin Lake basin may cause pollution to water, especially with widely used organophosphate pesticides, which have an effect on the human nervous system. This research sought to determine concentrations of dichlorvos of the synthetic organophosphate pesticide in the waters of the environment surrounding Al-Sin Lake in the Syrian coastal area. A questionnaire form was dispensed to the local residents in the region, to determine the status of the studied area. Ground and surface water samples were collected from several locations surrounding the Lake. The first site is surrounded by greenhouses and a citrus orchard. The second is the Surit spring. The third site includes greenhouses. The fourth site represents surface water (Lake Surit). The study lasted for seven consecutive months from December until June 2020-2021, samples were taken once a month. Various parameters (pH, EC, TDS, and PO4-3) were measured. Dichlorvos was extracted from the samples using solvents (hexane-acetone) to be ready for analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed the presence of dichlorvos residues in the studied water samples, with average concentrations ranging between 0.2 and 1.3 mu g.L-1, which were higher than the recommended value for individual pesticide in water (0.1 mu g.L-1) as recommended by the European Union. Observations of dichlorvos concentration indicated some increase at lower pH. Consequently, contamination of ground and surface waters with dichlorvos was observed in the studied sites, because of its frequent use and its high solubility in water. This unregulated use of dichlorvos can pose a matter of public health concern.						, Deema/0009-0007-3372-9235													1088-1913	1520-6483				SEP	2024	34	1								10.1002/tqem.22175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tqem.22175		JAN 2024											WOS:001142483600001

This study investigated seasonal infiltration, water repellency, and preferential water flow in two Sierra Nevada soil types (a granitic and a volcanic soil) in forest and meadow areas using a rainfall simulator. Infiltration and runoff were measured at the plot surface. Plots were subsequently excavated to measure preferential water flow. Water repellency was found to affect infiltration and nonuniform preferential Bow was observed. The volcanic soil demonstrated continuous preferential flow with depth, whereas in the granitic soil, preferential Bow rapidly dissipated. Wetting patterns showed greater preferential low in the forested areas for both soils compared with the meadow areas. Higher initial water content and reduced water repellency in the early spring generally produced more typical matrix water flow in the coarser textured granitic soil. Since preferencial flow was most evident in all forested conditions, nutrient bypass potential is considered greatest on soils in forested areas near tributaries and the lake.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				SEP-OCT	1994	58	5					1555	1561		10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800050040x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800050040x													WOS:A1994PH24600040

The Toya Ignimbrite (thickness < 80 m) is rhyolitic in composition and comprises six stratigraphic units: (1) a fine-grained ash-fall deposit at the base;(2) a base surge deposit and an overlying, voluminous, pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposit, both of which contain accretionary lapilli; (3) a number of base surge deposits and associated ash-fall deposits; (4) a pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposit that contains large lithic clasts up to 50 cm in diameter;(5) a pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposit with a basal lithic-rich layer (lag breccia); and (6) a pumiceous pyroclastic flow deposit at the top. The stratigraphy suggests that the caldera-forming eruption at Toya caldera commenced with a phreatomagmatic explosive eruption (forming unit 1), followed by violent phreatomagmatic eruptions that generated a voluminous pyroclastic flow (unit 2), and small-scale phreatomagmatic eruptions that generated a number of base surges (unit 3). The next phreatomagmatic eruption triggered caldera collapse (unit 4), which reached the climax with a violent phreatomagmatic eruption (unit 5) and ended with a magmatic eruption (unit 6). These eruptions occurred continuously without any significant time breaks. Component analysis of non-juvenile lithic clasts suggests that the vent-opening phase of the caldera-forming eruption involved a single vent. Pyroclastic flows during the caldera collapse may have erupted from multiple vents. Textural studies of pumice clasts suggest that white pumice was ejected during the initial to final stages, while banded pumice and grey pumice were ejected during the final stage. Geochemical data indicate that there was no significant change in magma composition during the caldera-forming eruption, with the exception of a small amount of mafic magma was mixed into the rhyolitic magma during the final stage.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2018	127	2			SI		191	227		10.5026/jgeography.127.191	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.127.191													WOS:000435697300007
J	Lorenz, RD				Lorenz, Ralph D.			The flushing of Ligeia: Composition variations across Titan's seas in a simple hydrological model	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We use a simple box model to explore possible differences in the liquid composition of Titan's seas. Major variations in the abundance of involatile ethane, somewhat analogous to salinity in terrestrial waters, arise from the hydrological cycle, which introduces more fresh methane rainfall at the highest latitudes in summer. The observed composition of Ligeia Mare, flushed by methane rainfall and exporting its solutes to Kraken via a narrow labyrinth of channels, may have a methane-rich (>similar to 80%) composition, well out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere, whereas the basins of Kraken are relatively well mixed and will have an ethane-dominated (similar to 60%) composition. These variations, analogous to Earth's salinity gradient between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, may be detectable with Cassini measurements and are important for future exploration.

J	Feng, JL; Chen, F; Hu, HP				Feng, Jin-Liang; Chen, Feng; Hu, Hai-Ping			Isotopic study of the source and cycle of sulfur in the Yamdrok Tso basin, Southern Tibet, China	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This study focuses on the inland drainage basin of Yamdrok Tso (Tso means 'lake' in the Tibetan language), which lies at altitudes between 4394 and 4989 m, in southern Tibet. The basin is located in the Tethys Himalayan zone, and consists of seven lakes with different hydrological characteristics. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the source of dissolved SO42- and the sulfur cycle in the groundwater-river-lake system. We measured the hydrogeochemical composition, delta(OH2O)-O-18, delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) of sulfate in river, spring and lake water; the total sulfur content (S-Total) and delta S-34(Total) of total sulfur in a lake sediment core; and the delta S-34(pyrite) of pyrite in the bedrock. The results indicate that most of the rivers in the study area are characterized by a high sulfate content with values of up to 270 mg/L. In addition, the delta S-34(pyrite) of pyrite in the bedrock ranges between -4.31% and -5.77%, while the sulfate in river and spring waters has mainly negative values of delta S-34(SO4) (-7.14% to -2.02%) and delta O-18(SO4) (-13.2% to -4.04%). In contrast, the waters of closed lakes in the study basin have high values of delta S-34(SO4) (3.44% -8.58%) and delta O-18(SO4) (7.26%-10.3%). The negative delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) dual-isotopic composition of sulfate indicates that pyrite weathering controls the dissolved sulfate and other solutes in rivers and spring water, while the anthropogenic pollutant sulfur flux is negligible. Water is the main oxygen source for sulfate derived from the oxidation of pyrite, while Fe3+ is the main direct agent of pyrite S oxidation. The lake water and sediments in the study basin are important sinks/stores of sulfur. The delta S-34(Total) values of total sulfur in a sediment core from a closed and holomictic lake ranges between -8.5% and -44.9%. As evidenced by the strong S-34 and O-18 enrichment in the residual pool of SO42- in the lake waters, and the marked depletion of S-34 in the sediment core, the dissimilatory microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) in the lake sediments generally results in the preferential sequestration of sulfur enriched in S-32. In addition, the magnitude of S-34/S-32 fractionation between sulfate in the lake water and sedimentary total sulfur can reach up to 48.3%. This abnormally high fractionation value can be explained mainly by the reoxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds, together with the dispropotionation pathway in the sediments, caused by lake level fluctuations. The changes in STotal and delta S-34(Total) values with depth in the sediment core can also be explained by the same mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is also a region with limited palaeoclimate records. Environmental magnetic, organic geochemical, sedimentological and carbon isotopic studies were carried out on the SS-1 sediments to reconstruct the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability during the Holocene. The chronology of the sediments is constrained by three AMS C-14 dates. Environmental magnetic data reveal that there is no contribution from bacterial magnetite, greigite and anthropogenic magnetite/lithogenic grains and that the magnetic signal is contributed mainly by the pedogenic component. The environmental magnetic data also depict variations in pedogenic magnetite production in the catchment and detrital influx to the lake, which in turn is related to monsoonal rainfall amount. The sedimentological data reveal variations in sediment size related to monsoon. The C-org/N ratio and delta C-13 indicate palaeovegetational variations in the SS catchment. Periods of strong monsoon are characterized by high values of concentration-dependent magnetic parameters like chi(lf), chi(fd), chi(ARM) and SIRM, high sand content, low C-org/N ratio (fully aquatic-deep water conditions), relatively depleted delta C-13 values (more C-3 but less C-4 land plants) and vice versa. The prominent palaeomonsoon events documented in this study are: (i) 11,100-10,700 cal yr BP with a weak ISM, (ii) 10,700 to 8600 cal yr BP characterized by intensified ISM, corresponding to the Early Holocene Optimum, (iii) 8600 to 4500 cal yr BP with a weakened ISM, (iv) 4500 to 3300 cal yr BP characterized by fluctuating monsoonal conditions, (v) 3300 cal yr BP to the Present with a slight increasing trend in ISM. A similar pattern is also documented in many palaeomonsoon records from the region, which indicate that Shantisagara sediments were able to record regional climatic variations as well.

J	Chen, YJ; Reid, S; May, B				Chen, Yongjiu; Reid, Stewart; May, Bernie			Genetic relationships of tui chub populations in the northwestern Great Basin and conservation implications for the Cow Head Tui Chub	CONSERVATION GENETICS												The Cow Head Tui Chub, Siphateles thalassinus vaccaceps, is restricted to the small Cow Head basin in far northeastern California and northwestern Nevada. Using microsatellite DNA loci, we found extensive genetic variation among tui chub populations in the Cow Head and surrounding basins of the northwestern Great Basin. Our data support the systematic conclusions of earlier authors, while showing distinct intraspecific differences between populations in most subbasins within the pluvial basins examined. The Cow Head Tui Chub forms a distinctive population within S. thalassinus with greatest affinity to the tui chub in the Warner Valley into which the Cow Head Lake drains. Tui chubs from the Goose Lake and Pit River basins are genetically very similar. Warner, Abert, Summer Lake, Catlow and Guano basin tui chubs appear distinct, both from each other and from tui chubs in the other basins. However, genetic proximity and some overlap between populations in presumably isolated hydrologic basins (i.e. Summer-Goose-Warner) suggest the possibility of unrecognized hydrologic connections or anthropogenic transport across barriers. Current genetic diversity in the Cow Head Tui Chub population is similar to that of stream-associated populations. We suggest that the Cow Head Tui Chub should remain a species of conservation concern due to its highly restricted distribution in an arid environment. Successful conservation of this unique fish will depend on stewardship of its limited habitat and maintenance of connectivity between subpopulations in a manner that ensures its long-term viability.																			1566-0621	1572-9737				FEB	2009	10	1					101	114		10.1007/s10592-008-9529-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-008-9529-x													WOS:000263865100009

Because macrophyte production within Mackenzie Delta lakes is largely governed by the degree of river influence, estimates of past production within a lake may be used to infer past Mackenzie River influence. A diatom-based predictive model, using sub-ice winter methane concentrations as an indirect estimate of macrophyte production, was applied to fossil diatom assemblages identified in Mackenzie Delta lake sediment cores. Temporal shifts in the relative abundance of fossil diatom assemblages were recorded at all sites. Benthic and epiphytic fossil diatom taxa were common in lakes with minor river influence, whereas planktonic species dominated lakes with appreciable river connection. The fossil diatom record indicated that taxa are responding to changes in the degree of river influence and lake genesis. Lakes having the least amount of river connection supported the most favorable environment for macrophyte production, resulting in the highest sediment organic matter content, and consequently, the highest estimates of methane concentrations. Tn general, the diatom-inferred winter methane concentrations appeared to be reliable, and they indirectly track the main direction of variation in the fossil diatom assemblages. The lack of consistent trends between sites in diatom assemblage changes/inferred methane values indicates that the hydrology near Inuvik, although highly variable, has not undergone a steady-state shift over the past similar to 200 yr. However, our results do indicate that diatom taxa in delta lakes are sensitive to hydrological fluctuations in the Mackenzie River and that our present approach would be ideally suited for detecting long-term (e.g., decadal) hydrological variations.

The regression method reported in the literature was modified because it had a conceptual bias and overestimated detritus. POM composition expressed as chlorophyll, particulate organic C, particulate organic N and particulate organic P was also analyzed. This analysis showed that living seston was the major component of POM during the 7 mo. Detritius was minimal during the year and increased to 39% of POM by fall. Most detritus was autochthonous. The lack of correlation between the particulate organic P and the other components of POM shows that the available P is rapidly recycled in an efficient manner and not significantly bound in detrital material. The coupling of statistical techniques and data collected during the intensive study of Lake Superior has provided a good insight into the relationships and seasonal patterns of nutrients and chlorophyll.																			0380-1330						1984	10	3					299	306		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71843-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71843-0													WOS:A1984TL80400014

Samples were collected monthly in the limnetic zone. Because of their small size, APP were identified and quantified using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. The warm monomictic nature of this reservoir resulted in thermal stratification during most of the year. Near surface dissolved oxygen was relatively high (7.61 mg/L). However, hypoxic and anoxic conditions were present in the hypolimnion during the whole period of study. Flow cytometry analyses allowed the identification of two populations of picoplanktonic organisms. Picocyanobacteria groups (phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus type) were dominant throughout the study, with maximum summer abundances of 6.6 x 10(4) cells/mL, although picoeukaryotes were temporally important. Annual mean total chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the euphotic zone was 7.54 +/- 3.41 mu g/L. Fractionated Chl-a exhibited a relatively constant pattern: ranging from 0.24 to 1.99 mu g/L. The average contribution of APP to total Chl-a concentration was 11%. Chl-a concentration reflected the annual variation in picoplankton, being higher during summer when solar radiation was also higher. The picoplanktonic community was structured in accordance to thermal stratification, nutrients and light availability. Understanding the dynamics of picoplankton and their response to environmental change are important because they are a good indicator of the trophic status of reservoirs, especially drinking water reservoirs, and can guide management decisions.

Herein, we use a multispectral remote sensing approach to describe the spatial and temporal occurrences of whitings in Lake Geneva from 2013 to 2021. Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 sensors are combined to derive the AreaBGR index and identify whitings using appropriate filters. 95% of the detected whitings are located in the northeastern part of the lake and occur in a highly reproducible environmental setting. An extended time series of whitings in the last 60 years is reconstructed from a random forest algorithm and analyzed through a Bayesian decomposition for annual and seasonal trends. The annual number of whiting days between 1958 and 2021 does not follow any particular monotonic trend. The inter-annual changes of whiting occurrences significantly correlate to the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index. Spring whitings have increased since 2000 and significantly follow the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index. Future climate change in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean could induce more variable and earlier whiting events in Lake Geneva.					; Odermatt, Daniel/A-9379-2011; Mariethoz, Gregoire/D-1868-2009	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; MANY, Gael/0000-0002-8480-7471; Ferrari, Michele/0000-0002-9767-1104; Jacquet, Philippe/0000-0002-6005-6095; Mariethoz, Gregoire/0000-0002-8820-2808														2072-4292				DEC	2022	14	23							6175	10.3390/rs14236175	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14236175													WOS:000896162600001

An unsteady flow is simulated by solving numerically a system of thermal convection equations in the Boussinesq approximation using second-order implicit difference schemes in both space and time. To calculate the velocity and pressure fields in the model, an original procedure for buoyant flows, SIMPLED, which is a modification of the well-known Patankar and Spalding's SIMPLE algorithm, has been developed. The simulation results have shown that the thermal bar plays a key role in propagation of pollution in the area of Selenga River inflow into Lake Baikal.

A floating cage system for rearing freshwater mussels Anodonta anatina and Unio mancus in Piedmont region (NW Italy)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This research represents the first attempt in Italy to develop a cage system for adult freshwater mussel stocking, for extensive farming, that was realized from 2003 to 2005 in NW Italy. Two autochthonous species of Italian freshwater mussel were used: Anodonta anatina and Unio mancus. 5133 mussels were collected and successively stocked in floating cages in 5 different sites in a lake. This study was planned in order to determine the effect of main rearing factors for potential farming: stocking density and cage position in the water column (depth). For each species, the effects of three rearing densities and two water depths were tested. Mussel growth was measured on a monthly basis in each experimental unit throughout the study. The survival rate at the end of the experiment for both species considered was 98.4%. U. mancus resulted to be more resistant to rearing conditions and during the summer the highest mortality was registered for A. anatina. Summer mortality was between 4.8% and 20.5%. Highest mortality in U. mancus was recorded in September 2004 at 1.5 m (3.6 +/- 2.4%), while the highest mortality for A. anatina was recorded in September 2003 as 13.3%+/- 3.8% at a depth of 1.5 m. This research showed that cage stocking is a suitable method and the optimal position of cages is at the lake thermocline. The proposed species proved to be easily utilizable for future farming or bioremediation projects, and can readily be reared up to 135 kg m(-3).

Identification of toxic Cyanobacteria in Lake Baikal	DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS												Cyanobacteria of the genera Anabaena and Microcystis, containing genes for the synthesis of-microcystins (hepatotoxic cyanotoxins) were found for the first time in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal near-the village of Turka, where a tourism and recreational complex were constructed. According to the enzyme-immunoassay, microcystin concentration in water was 0.17 +/- 0.01 A mu g/L. Using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, we found 3936 sequences in the eubacterial community of central basin of Lake Baikal. The summer bacterioplankton in both littoral and pelagic areas of the lake was dominated by the phylum Cyanobacteria, whereas a higher diversity of cyanobacteria was recorded in the plankton of the littoral zone. Moreover, the-potentially toxic Anabaena and Microcystis were detected in this area.

J	Hough, SE; Dollar, RS; Johnson, P				Hough, SE; Dollar, RS; Johnson, P			The 1998 earthquake sequence south of Long Valley Caldera, California: Hints of magmatic involvement	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A significant episode of seismic and geodetic unrest took place at Long Valley Caldera, California, beginning in the summer of 1997. Activity through late May of 1998 was concentrated in and around the south moat and the south margin of the resurgent dome. The Sierran Nevada block (SNB) region to the south/southeast remained relatively quiet until a M 5.1 event occurred there on 9 June 1998 (UT). A second M 5.1 event followed on 15 July (UT); both events were followed by appreciable aftershock sequences. An additional, distinct burst of activity began on 1 August 1998. The number of events in the August sequence (over the first week or two) was similar to the aftershock sequence of the 15 July 1998 M 5, 1 event, but the later sequence was not associated with any events larger than M 4.3, All of the summer 1998 SNB activity was considered tectonic rather than magmatic; in general the SNB is considered an unlikely location for future eruptions. However, the August sequence-an "aftershock sequence without a mainshock"-is suggestive of a strain event larger than the cumulative seismotectonic strain release. Moreover, a careful examination of waveforms from the August sequence reveals a small handful of events whose spectral signature is strikingly harmonic. We investigate the waveforms of these events using spectral, autocorrelation, and empirical Green's function techniques and conclude that they were most likely associated with a fluid-controlled source. Our observations suggest that there may have been some degree of magma or magma-derived fluid involvement in the 1998 SNB sequence.																			0037-1106					JUN	2000	90	3					752	763		10.1785/0119990109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0119990109													WOS:000088170600016

Millennial-scale vegetation and climatic changes from an Early to Mid-Holocene lacustrine archive in Central Ganga Plains using multiple biotic proxies	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Indo-Gangetic floodplains have many abandoned meander cut-offs and oxbow lakes that can serve as potential archives for high-resolution paleoclimatic reconstruction. Previously, a few of these lakes have been investigated for understanding the regional Holocene climatic history, but these studies are generally limited by a lack of high chrono-stratigraphic resolution. To develop an understanding of the role of local and/or regional climate forcings, an oxbow lake (Baraila Tal) in the Central Ganga Plains has been studied using multiple biotic proxies such as pollen, phytoliths, diatoms, and sponge spicules. Millennial-scale climatic fluctuations and vegetation history for the Early to Mid-Holocene period have been reconstructed using 17 AMS radiocarbon dates from two trenches, 3-4 m deep. Five major biotic zones have been delineated between 13.2 and 4.8 kyr BP. Zone I (similar to 13-12 kyr BP) shows small patches of dry tropical woody flora along with tall C4 grass indicating a moderately dry climate. The presence of low-temperature herbs indicates an active NE monsoon but the paucity of arboreals indicates a weakened Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The high percentages of Phacotus lenticularis cysts in Zone II (12-9 kyr BP) indicate the presence of stagnant, lime-rich inland waters under relatively colder climatic conditions. The appearance of evergreen forest groves around 11.5 kyr BP indicates an increase in humidity, and lake deepening was inferred between 10.9 and 10.3 kyr BP. Sediment accumulation rate shows a sudden drop at similar to 10.3 kyr BP indicating a complete cut-off of the oxbow lake from the fluvial channel. Zone III (9-8 kyr BP) records millennial-scale drying with a complete absence of aquatic pollen between 8.9 and 7.7 kyr BP. The expansion of short C4 grass in Zone IV (8-7 kyr BP) further indicates drier conditions. Zone V (7-similar to 5 kyr BP) shows very high percentages of sponge spicules that flourish in clear waters, and represents a strengthened ISM and a subsequent lake expansion. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Griggs, RF				Griggs, RF			The edge of the forest in Alaska and the reasons for its position	ECOLOGY												The great coniferous forest stretching up the coast from Puget Sound and from Labrador to Alaska terminate in the Katmai district, the Hudsonian forest of Picea canadensis around Naknek Lake on the mainland and the coastal forest of P. sitchensis at Kodiak. Several early accounts of Kodiak describe as treeless areas now occupied by heavy forest. The trees at the edge of the forest were found to be growing as rapidly as the same species 1000 miles within its borders to the SE. They are likewise reproducing freely and are rapidly migrating into new territory. The marginal trees are small because they are young, none within a mile of the forest border being more than 100 yrs. old. There are no fallen logs or other remains of trees older than the present generation. Many trees now standing in thick forest evidently began life in the open. Three miles back from the forest border the trees are more than 300 yrs. old and have attained great size. Dead trees and fallen logs are present. The pollens preserved in peat bogs at the forest edge also show that the spruces are recent arrivals and are thus the only spruces that have grown in the vicinity since the beginning of the bog. The forest migration thus demonstrated, taken to be a continuance of the readjustment since the last glaciation, suggests that the vegetation of boreal and north temperate regions generally may not yet have fully recovered from the last glacial period.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1934	15						80	96		10.2307/1932778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932778													WOS:000200148400013

Short Internal Waves in a Small Ice-Covered Lake	WATER RESOURCES												The high-precision observational data on water temperature obtained during seven winters in a small boreal lake are considered. The spectral analysis revealed that the oscillations with a period of about 27 min prevailed in a water column. This period is close to the theoretical estimate of the first mode of the longitudinal barotropic seiche. The variability of temperature oscillations, vertical velocity, and displacement of isotherms suggest the presence of short internal waves along with seiches. The amplitude of the internal waves is an order of magnitude greater than that of seiches, and the length of internal waves is two orders of magnitude less than the linear extent of the lake.

J	Messina, P; Stoffer, P				Messina, P; Stoffer, P			Terrain analysis of the Racetrack Basin and the sliding rocks of Death Valley	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Racetrack Playa's unusual surface features known as sliding rocks have been the subject of an ongoing debate and several mapping projects for half a century, although the causative mechanism remains unresolved. Clasts ranging in volume from large pebbles to medium boulders have, unwitnessed, maneuvered around the nearly flat dry lake over considerable distances. The controversy has persisted partly because eyewitness accounts of the phenomenon continue to be lacking, and the earlier mapping missions were limited in method and geographic range. In July 1996, we generated the first complete map of all observed sliding rock trails by submeter differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) mapping technology. The resulting map shows 162 sliding rocks and associated trails to an accuracy of approximately 30 cm. Although anemometer data are not available in the Racetrack wilderness, wind is clearly a catalyst for sliding rock activity; an inferred wind rose was constructed from DGPS trail segment data. When the entire trail network is examined in plan, some patterns emerge, although other (perhaps expected relations) remain elusive: terrain analysis of the surrounding topography demonstrates that the length and morphology of trails are more closely related to where rocks rested at the onset of motion than to any physical attribute of the rocks themselves. Follow-up surveys in May 1998, May 1999, August 1999, and November 1999 revealed little modification of the July, 1996 sliding rock configuration. Only four rocks were repositioned during the El Nino winter of 1997-1998, suggesting that activity may not be restricted to winter storms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Qin, BQ; Shi, YF; Yu, G				Qin, BQ; Shi, YF; Yu, G			The reconstruction and interpretations of lake status at 6 ka and 18 ka BP in inland mainland Asia	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												By means of survey of literature through compilations of sedimentological, biogeological and geomorphologic data, the inland take level changes in arid or semi-arid mainland Asia at 6 and 18 ka B.P. have been reconstructed. The results showed that the lakes from western and northwestern Asia were characterized by very high water levels at 18 ka B. P., but low or intermediate water stands at 6 ka B. P. The high lake level in this region was associated with the southward displacement of westerlies, therefore, the extent of the high lake stand indicated the southern flank of westerlies during the glaciation. Conversely, the lakes from the eastern and southern Asia registered comparative low levels at 18 ka B. P, and significantly high one at 6 ka B. P. The towering of lake level at 18 ka B. P. was caused by the weakened summer monsoon and the high lake level at 6 ka B. P. by the enhanced summer monsoon induced by the enlarged thermal contrast between land and ocean. The extent of high lake levels indicated the northern boundary of monsoon expansion. Between the above two regions, there is a climatic transitional zone in the Central Asia where the take behavior was close to that in southeastern Asia at 6 ka B. P. but became similar to that in northwestern Asia at 18 ka B. P. Thus this zone became a transitional sector from the monsoon to the westerlies.

The study also extended to establish a relationship between vegetation cover changes and erosion during the last 14.5 ka with pollen record and clay mineral proxies. Smectite/kaolinite and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios allow us to assess hydrolysis conditions in lowlands and/or physical erosion process in highlands of the Gonghe Basin. Before 12.9 Cal ka BP, both mineralogical ratios show low values indicative of strong physical erosion in the basin with a dominant cold and dry phase. After 12.9 Cal ka BP, an increase in both mineralogical ratios indicates enhanced chemical weathering in the basin associated with a warm and humid climate. The beginning of Holocene is characterized by high smectite/(illite+chlorite) and smectite/kaolinite ratios that is synchronous as with deposition of many peat laminae, implying the best warm and humid conditions specifically between 8.0 to 5.5 Cal ka BP. The time interval after 5.0 Cal ka BP is characterized by a return to high physical erosion and low chemical weathering with dry climate conditions in the basin. Comparing variations of clay mineral assemblages with previous pollen results, we observe a rapid response in terms of chemical weathering and physical erosion intensity to a modification of the vegetation cover in the basin.

Silica-Bearing Mounds and Strata in the Southwest Melas Basin, Valles Marineris, Mars: Evidence for a Hydrothermal Origin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												A small basin on the Southwest (SW) margin of Melas Chasma in Valles Marineris, Mars, hosts a variety of previously identified sedimentary fans and layered strata hypothesized to have been formed by one or more paleolakes. This basin also contains light-toned layered mounds that have distinct spectral absorption bands consistent with amorphous hydrated silica (e.g., opal). While the general morphology and mineralogy of these features and the basin itself have been previously characterized, the formation mechanism of the hydrated silica features and their temporal relationships with the proposed paleolake remain to be determined. We use Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars visible through short-wave infrared reflectance spectra (0.35-2.65 mu m) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment digital terrain models and images to analyze the stratigraphic location and morphology of the opaline silica-bearing features in the SW Melas basin. We find that the basin hosts fourteen high-relief "mounds," eight low-relief "patches," and two extended layers within the sedimentary strata that are light-toned, fractured, and often exhibit hydrated silica-like spectral signatures. We hypothesize that the mounds are spring deposits formed by sub-aerial hydrothermal activity, while the patches and layers correspond to sub-lacustrine hydrothermal activity. The varied elevations of the mounds and patches indicate at least one fluctuation of lake level in the basin during its history. The combination of contemporaneous hydrothermal and lacustrine activity to form silica-cemented sedimentary deposits in a nutrient-rich subaqueous environment would have been conducive to forming and preserving biosignatures in the SW Melas basin.					; Horgan, Briony/Q-8136-2018	Gehringer, Emma Rae/0009-0002-5001-0971; Horgan, Briony/0000-0001-6314-9724													2169-9097	2169-9100				NOV	2023	128	11							e2023JE007881	10.1029/2023JE007881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JE007881													WOS:001102298300001

Microbial foodweb comparison of the Laurentian Great Lakes during the summers of 2001-2004	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												A structural and functional assessment of the microbial foodweb of Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario was undertaken during late summer (August) between 2001 and 2004. One lake was sampled in each year. Our analysis included microscopic enumerations of bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton, phytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates coupled with radioisotope tracer measurements of primary productivity (C-14) and bacterial growth (H-3). Phytoplankton biomass was highest on average in Lake Erie (approximate to 1.9g m(-3)) and lowest in Lake Ontario (approximate to 0.2g m(-3)), whereas microbial loop biomass was highest in Lake Ontario (approximate to 2.4g m(-3)) and lowest in Lake Huron (approximate to 0.1g m(-3)). The organic carbon pool was found to be predominantly autotrophic (>80%) in Lakes Superior (approximate to 280mg C m(-3)), Huron (approximate to 195mg C m(-3)) and Erie (approximate to 660mg C m(-3)) and smaller picoplankton had the highest carbon turnover rates (approximate to 0.4-1.5 d(-1)). However, in Lake Ontario (approximate to 335mg C m(-3)) the carbon pool was about 75% heterotrophic and larger net plankton had the highest carbon turnover rates (approximate to 6.8 d(-1)). Despite differences in trophic state, the microbial foodwebs of Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie appeared to function in a similar and efficient manner. In contrast, the microbial foodweb of Lake Ontario appeared to be unhealthy with autochthonous production being sequestered by heterotrophic nanoflagellates. More detailed work is needed to understand the foodweb linkages both within the Great Lakes and among them.

This study analyzed the general hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water to determine the spatiotemporal variability of contaminants and to assess the potential health risk associated with the surface water. Lake water was monitored at three stations each month throughout 2013. Samples were analyzed for pH, total dissolved solids, temperature, EC, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3 (-), and CO3 (2-)), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), fluoride (F-), phenol, and heavy metals (As, Hg, and Cr6+). The results suggest that Na+ is the dominant cation in the lake water, and Cl- and SO4 (2-) are the dominant anions, resulting in a primary water type of Cl center dot SO4-Na. Contaminant levels (NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol) vary through time and space (spatiotemporal variations). As and F- are high in the summer season; Cr6+ and Hg do not significantly change over the year; and the NH4-N and phenol concentrations also remain relatively stable. Concentrations of all these substances are within the acceptable limits for recreational water use (1.5, 1.5, 0.1, 0.001, 0.05, and 0.01 mg/L for NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol, respectively). An assessment model recommended by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the P.R. China was used in the study to conduct the health risk assessment. While workers do experience higher non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks than tourists, the risks are low and negligible. As and Cr6+ contribute the most to total carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks.

J	Ong, C; Fowler, APG; Seyfried, WE; Sun, T; Fu, Q				Ong, Claire; Fowler, Andrew P. G.; Seyfried, William E., Jr.; Sun, Tao; Fu, Qi			Organic compounds in vent fluids from Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Hydrothermal fluids were collected over a three-year interval (2016-2018) from two sublacustrine vent fields in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming: Stevenson Island Deep Hole (YL16 and YL17 series in 2016 and 2017, respectively) and West Thumb (YL18 series in 2018). The TOC content in SI Deep Hole vent fluids varies from 2.7 mg/L to 6.3 mg/L in YL16 and 5.0 mg/L to 16.2 mg/L in YL17. Compared to YL16, the average TOC value of YL17 has more than doubled. The range of TOC is from 7.3 mg/L to 13.7 mg/L in the West Thumb samples. A positive correlation between TOC and dissolved CO2 concentration is observed in most samples, suggesting their close relationship with sublacustrine heat and mass transfer processes. The organic compounds detected at both vent fields are diverse in molecular structure. In the SI Deep Hole, complex cyclic and unsaturated organic compounds are dominant, with cyclic hydrocarbons having the highest abundance, followed by carboxylic acids, PAHs, and alcohols. At West Thumb vents, propanol is most abundant, followed by alcohols, PAHs, alkanes, and carboxylic acids. This difference in structural complexity and relative quantity of organic compounds may be attributed to the involvement of hydrothermal processes. The vapor-dominated hydrothermal system and extensive fluid-rock interactions in SI Deep Hole facilitate alteration/decomposition of organic precursors. While CO2(aq) is predominant in vent fluids, dissolved CH4 is much less abundant. In SI Deep Hole, the carbon isotopic composition of CH4 in most samples ranges from -20.4%o to -38.0%o, with values of less than -60%o in three samples, while CO2 ranges from -4.4%o to -10.5%o. A temporal variation of 813C values was obtained for CO2, with the average increasing from -9.2%o (YL16) to -5.2%o (YL17). In West Thumb, the 813C value of CO2 and CH4 fall in a similar range, with an average of -10.5%o and -19.0%o, respectively. There are multiple sources for observed carbon species: the interaction of vent fluids with subsurface rocks and lake sediments is the predominant process, followed by thermal decomposition of organic matter. Microbial activity on the lake floor may contribute to methane formation, while magmatic degassing is the major process that produces CO2. The connection between vapor-dominated hydrothermal alteration, elevated TOC contents and dissolved CO2 in vent fluids, and enrichment of 13C in CO2 in YL17 in SI Deep Hole suggests an interplay of geological, chemical, and biological processes and their imprints on vent fluids, all of which make significant contribution to the carbon cycle in the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem.					; Seyfried, William/HKF-4013-2023; Fu, Qi/HTT-2030-2023	Fu, Qi/0000-0003-1338-0957; Fowler, Andrew/0000-0001-8908-3495													0146-6380	1873-5290				SEP	2021	159								104275	10.1016/j.orggeochem.2021.104275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2021.104275		JUL 2021											WOS:000680247100005

At the Watershed: 1958 and the Beginnings of Lake Baikal Environmentalism	SLAVONIC AND EAST EUROPEAN REVIEW												In August 1958, one of the most visible and dynamic environmental protection movements in Soviet history exploded onto the public stage. In an effort to shield Lake Baikal and its surroundings from the effects of an aggressive industrial development campaign in eastern Siberia, the proponents of Baikal alerted the Soviet public and its leadership to the threats of such economic agendas to the natural world. This article tells the story of the first stage of the multi-decade history of Lake Baikal environmentalism, front its genesis in 1958 to 1961. Coming out in advance of Rachel Carson's 1962 Silent Spring, the story of the Baikal environmentalists highlights the existence of an influential, local-level, scientist-driven environmental activism in post-war Soviet Russia and also asks us to rethink the place of the Soviet experience in the global development of environmentalism.																			0037-6795	2222-4327				JAN	2015	93	1					147	+																WOS:000347453100007
J	ELDER, WH				ELDER, WH			AGE AND SEX CRITERIA AND WEIGHTS OF CANADA GEESE	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												A total of 2,179 Canada geese, Branta c. canadensis, shot by hunters and live-trapped in banding studies at Horse Shoe lake, Alexander Co., Illinois, were weighed and examined in testing the reliability of criteria for age and sex detn. The max. wt. was obtained by a [male] of 11 lbs., 9 oz. Only 6 birds exceeded 10 lbs.; all were [male][male] cf. The average wt. of juvenile [male][male] was 6.5 lbs., of adult [male][male] 7.01 lbs., of juvenile [male][male] 7.5 lbs., and of adult [male][male] 8.4 lbs. The differences between the wt. of juvenile and adult geese of each sex and the wts. of [male][male] and [female][female] at any age were significant. The wt. loss during the winter was significant in all groups. The best criterion for distinguishing the juvenile bird is the notch in the tips of the rectrices. The dull brownish cast of these feathers as well as of the remiges is distinct from the glossy black of the adult. Molt of the rectrices is centrifugal and in juvenile birds it continues through the winter. Pigmentation of the cloaca, ureteral papillae, penis and clitoris increases with age. This gradual change as well as the gradual increase in size of the penis, the slow resorption of the bursa of Fabricius and occluding oviducal membrane, all indicate that sexual maturity in wild Canada geese is not reached until the 3d or 4th year of life.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1946	10	2					93	111		10.2307/3796071	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796071													WOS:A1946YB64100004

Holocene chemostratigraphy of spring sediments in Range Creek Canyon, Utah, USA	HOLOCENE												This study builds off the paleoclimatic reconstruction created by Hart et al. that used a multiproxy study to examine the role of moisture in the exodus of the Fremont from Range Creek Canyon in the 12th century. For this research, elemental ratios, weathering indices, and pollen data from two wetland spring sediment cores were used to compare with the existing Hart et al. paleoclimatic reconstruction (Objective 1). Elemental ratios and pollen data proved to be effective proxies for precipitation fluctuation, with the ratio of Pinus to Juniperus pollen representing effective moisture and increasing with the intensity of chemical weathering. Elemental data were additionally used to identify crypto tephra in the cores to validate Range Creek Canyon's existing chronology (Objective 2). The XRF analysis of the sediment cores constrained the chronology of environmental change in the canyon by identifying the elemental signature of the Mazama eruption (7627 +/- 150 cal. year BP). The concentration of Al, Y, and Ti were 50 times higher in this layer than elsewhere in the core, indicating a sudden depositional event, such as a volcanic eruption. Based on the multiproxy data and confirmed chronology, the Fremont entered the canyon during a period of elevated precipitation lasting until 600 AD. Precipitation levels remained steady until 1200 AD, after which precipitation levels decreased, causing drought conditions that coincide with the Fremont's departure from Range Creek Canyon.

Alewife YOY density (number per 1000 m3) was estimated from trawl catches. Larval alewife densities, derived from plankton net samples at trawling stations and from power plant entrainment samples, were averaged each year for length intervals which represented yolk-sac and post-yolk-sac larvae. Survival (ratios of YOY to larval alewife densities) varied considerably among years, but mean survival over all years from yolk-sac larvae to YOY was 1% calculated from either field-larvae or entrained-larvae data. Mean survival from post-yolk-sac larvae to YOY was higher, 2.2-4.6%. Daily mortality rates were 12-27% for larvae through yolk absorption, decreasing to 2-5% for juveniles. Differences in survival among years may be due to timing of sampling, distribution of larvae and YOY, or actual survival differences, perhaps related to predator abundance.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1986	43	7					1318	1326		10.1139/f86-165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-165													WOS:A1986D134700002

Geochemistry and fluxes of gases from hydrothermal features at Newberry Volcano, Oregon, USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We present the chemical and isotopic compositions of gases and fluxes of CO2 from the hydrothermal features of Newberry Volcano, a large composite volcano located in Oregon's Cascade Range with a summit caldera that hosts two lakes, Paulina and East Lakes. Gas samples were collected from 1982 to 2021 from Paulina Hot Springs (PHS) on the shore of Paulina Lake, East Lake Hot Springs (ELHS) on the shore of East Lake, and Obsidian Flow Gas Seep (OFGS), an area of diffuse gas emissions. Surveys of CO2 flux were conducted in 2020 at OFGS (1400 m2) and East Lake (4.1 km2). Gases from all three sites were CO2-rich (>= 79 mol% in dry gas) but showed considerable compositional variability over time due to interaction with ground and surface water. An increase in H2S concentrations and decline in CO2/H2S ratios in ELHS gases coincided with a drop in East Lake water level from 1999 to 2021. ELHS and OFGS gases were high in CH4 relative to PHS and the delta 13C of CH4 values for ELHS gases (-72.2 and -63.6 %o) reflected a predominantly biogenic origin. The dominant source of N2 and Ar in PHS, ELHS, and OFGS samples was likely groundwater. Helium isotopic ratios (6.47 to 8.02 Rc/Ra) support a persistent source of magmatic He beneath Newberry caldera and consistently high values measured at OFGS and PHS relative to ELHS suggest distinct fluid flow paths from depth to the surface features. The delta 13C of CO2 and CO2/3He values (-8.9 to-5.35 %o and 1.3 x 109 to 4.6 x 1010, respectively) measured in gases reflect con-tributions of CO2 from both mantle and crustal sources. Measured CO2 fluxes at OFGS and East Lake ranged from 1 to 8808 and < 1 to 364 g m- 2 d-1, respectively. A CO2 emission rate of 0.5 t d-1 was calculated for OFGS. The CO2 emission rate estimated for East Lake was 30 t d-1 and when compared to prior estimates, reflects steady-state lake degassing. An enhanced geochemical monitoring plan should be implemented, including annual sampling of gases at ELHS, OFGS, and PHS for geochemical analysis, installation of a continuous lake-level monitoring station at East Lake, and annual CO2 flux surveys at OFGS. Geochemical data should be integrated with data from the real-time seismic and GPS network to better resolve and interpret potential changes in the Newberry magmatic-hydrothermal system.

Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control diffuse sources of pollution from dairy agriculture were widely implemented through a voluntary program of technical assistance and cost-sharing by agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Intensive water quality monitoring was undertaken to document water quality changes resulting from the land treatment programs, including studies of BMP effectiveness and long-term watershed-scale trend monitoring. Some BMPs significantly reduced edge-of-field pollutant delivery to surface waters. Phosphorus export from corn fields was up to 1500% higher where manure was winter spread and up to 15% of the phosphorus applied in winter-spread manure was lost in runoff A vegetated filter strip retained more than 90% of sediment and nutrients in milking center waste and functioned effectively year-round. Watershed-level response, however, was not simply the sum of edge-of-field changes. Sediment concentration and export decreased in both project areas, but anticipated decreases in nutrient concentrations and toads did not occur. The most significant water quality trends observed were 50-75% reductions in indicator bacteria counts in all study watersheds. Factors contributing to the lack of general response in nutrient levels, recommendations for future agricultural pollution control projects, and implications for planning of diffuse source pollution control programs are discussed.

Predation pressure in the pelagic zone from invertebrate predators (mainly Cyclops scutifer) was similar to that from 2-year-old roach and led to suppression of the most important filter-feeding genus Daphnia. Those predators thus may have a stabiling effect on culturally eutrophic lakes, by maintaining the eutrophic phase beyond the predictions from spring nutrient values. To speed up the recovery of such lakes it is necessary to suppress both types of predators.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	1986	29	1					99	106		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb04929.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb04929.x													WOS:A1986D611500009
J	Lillie, RA				Lillie, RA			Macroinvertebrate community structure as a predictor of water duration in Wisconsin wetlands	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Fifty-four Wisconsin wetlands were surveyed in spring 1996 to determine relationships between macroinvertebrate community structure and a suite of 11 environmental attributes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that, after alkalinity, hydroperiod was the next most significant environmental factor influencing macroinvertebrate community structure within the wetlands sampled. CCA and direct gradient biplots were used to identify indicator taxa characteristic of the spring macroinvertebrate communities in persistent and ephemeral wetlands, and taxa characteristic of semi-terrestrial habitats adjacent to wetlands. Two models were developed to permit the prediction of a wetland's hydroperiod class. One model assigns a range of probabilities that a wetland has a hydroperiod longer or shorter than eight months based on the occurrence or abundance of fairy shrimp, mayflies, scuds, mosquitoes, and phantom midges. A second model predicts that a wetland's hydroperiod is longer or shorter than five months based on the joint occurrences of seven persistent indicator taxa. Data used in both models were derived from a rapid bioassessment of three shoreline D-frame net sweeps. The use of a coarse level taxonomic identification (primarily order and family) allows the approach to be performed in the field or laboratory. The macroinvertebrate models allow a manager to estimate a wetland's hydroperiod when long term water duration records do not exist. This ability is important to water resource managers because hydroperiod classification (i.e., water permanency) is one criterion used in differentiating wetlands from lakes in Wisconsin and because Wisconsin's legal system affords lakes substantially greater protection thanwetlands.																			1093-474X					APR	2003	39	2					389	400		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04393.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04393.x													WOS:000182673600013
J	HUGHES, RA; KOKELAAR, P				HUGHES, RA; KOKELAAR, P			THE TIMING OF ORDOVICIAN MAGMATISM IN THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT AND CROSS FELL INLIERS	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												Volcanic and hypabyssal intrusive rocks of the Lower Palaeozoic English Lake District and Cross Fell inliers are elements of the Ordovician destructive plate margin system of microcontinental Avalonia. Two igneous sheets within the marine sedimentary Skiddaw Group of these inliers, previously described as lavas, are reinterpreted as sills. Sedimentary rocks enclosing these sills are of late Tremadoc-early Arenig (c. 493 Ma) and early Llanvirn (< 476 Ma) age, and breccias along the upper contacts of both were produced by steam explosivity and fluidization ahead of the advancing tips of the intrusions. Previous interpretation of the breccias on the older sheet, as sediment deposited on the eroded top of a lava flow, implied an early Ordovician onset of arc magmatism. Such early magmatism would have been virtually coincident with the latest Tremadoc initiation of arc magmatism in Wales, but evidence for such a near synchronous response to the putative onset of subduction is lacking. Respective onsets of magmatism were probably separated by at least 17 m.y., and possibly by as much as 29 m.y. The apparent contemporaneity of mid and late Ordovician volcanic episodes in England and Wales, and similarities in extensional tectonic style, suggest that the two areas then were part of the same subduction system responding similarly to plate-scale magma-generating and tectonic processes. The early Ordovician situation is uncertain, but the absence of arc volcanic rocks of this age in the English Lake District suggests that this area and Wales are not tectonically juxtaposed elements of a former simple linear arc.																			0016-7568					MAY	1993	130	3					369	377		10.1017/S0016756800020057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756800020057													WOS:A1993LG21400008

Recent vegetation is one of the best preserved examples of Pious uncinata subsp. uliginosa (syn. P rotundata) bog woodland in Central Europe. The origin and development of the mire and changes in the surrounding landscape vegetation are reconstructed using sediment stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, pollen analysis and plant-macrofossils analysis, with particular emphasis on the processes that resulted in the origin of Rejviz bog and on pine woodland dynamics. Based on identified species the water level changes were reconstructed. The sediment started to accumulate more than 9000 years ago at an open mixed-woodland spring with Dichodontium palustre. Later, poor fen vegetation with sedges and horsetails developed. Around 6170 cal. yr BC the fen became inundated for 2000 years and (semi)aquatic vegetation thrived. Next step in the succession followed a decline in water level which resulted in the development of drier oligothrophic vegetation with a high representation of pine and dwarf shrubs. After ca 1020 cal. yr BC the mire became the bog it is now. Three wooded stages appeared in both the minerotrophic and ombrotrophic developmental phases: before 6720 cal. yr BC, during ca 1960-1020 cal. yr BC and recently. The vegetation in the surrounding landscape developed without marked human interventions up till ca the last six or five centuries, when deforestation and later settlement took place. Comparison with published data from the Gory Bystrzyckie/Orlicke hory Mu suggests that not only regional, but also local vegetation changed in a similar way across the middle-altitude eastern Sudetes, following oscillations in climate rather than local changes in mire water regime.

J	Nicu, IC; Romanescu, G				Nicu, Ionut Cristi; Romanescu, Gheorghe			Effect of natural risk factors upon the evolution of Chalcolithic human settlements in Northeastern Romania (Valea Oii watershed). From ancient times dynamics to present days degradation	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												This study concerns the analysis of the Valea Oii watershed and the dynamics of human settlement depending on the occurrence of natural risk factors and their evolution. These include climatic change fluctuations, and appearance of new hydrological resources like springs, from consequent landslides, the disappearance of forests as a direct effect from overexploitation of the land. Archaeological sites and current villages have been investigated, as well as their emplacement depending on natural hazards (such as floods, landslides and gully erosion). At the same time, we have also indexed the water sources which include streams, springs and man-made lakes. The first archaeological records date back to the Chalcolithic period. The entire catchment includes a total of 26 Chalcolithic archaeological sites which are continuously threatened by numerous natural or anthropic risks. The morpho-hydrographic, geologic, and pedologic particularities have determined an early occupation of the area situated in the upper part of the watershed. In ancient times, the lower sector of the valley and the floodplain was used for agricultural purpose or for pasturing. Throughout time, human settlements shifted gradually towards the lower area. This phenomenon was triggered by significant deforestation, which led to an extension of the pastures and of the agricultural land. In the modern period, most settlements moved towards areas that were submitted to flooding. This process was determined by the escalation of landslides and by gully erosion which began after deforestation. In order to protect the floodplain settlements, dams were built to reduce the effects of high waters. One of the main advantages of studying small catchments is that the results can be extrapolated for larger catchments (> 100 km(2)), the volume of analyzed data being smaller, but done with the same strictness. Therefore, the results of this study can surely provide important information and can save relevant archaeological and geographical data in a GIS which, in normal present conditions, would not be possible to be recovered in the future.

J	Manning, PG				Manning, PG			Bioavailability of riverine, sewage plant, and sediment phosphorus in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												The loadings of bioavailable nonapatite inorganic phosphorus in riverine suspended solids, sewage effluent and bottom sediments to the eutrophic Upper Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, are reported. The form and magnitude of all three sources are seasonally dependent. Increasingly over the summer, diffusional reflux from in-place sediments becomes the dominant source of bioavailable phosphorus. Values of the ratio phosphorus:ferrous iron show that most of the load of riverine inorganic phosphate ion is not deposited in the organic sediments within Upper Bay. It is considered to be weakly bioavailable, as it is transported through the Bay in oxic suspension. Remedial action to control eutrophication hinges on reduction of the rate of accumulation of nonapatite inorganic phosphorus in the bottom sediments. This means additional controls on sewage effluent, and a reduced loading of riverine phosphorus.																			0008-4476					JUN	1996	34		3				667	675																WOS:A1996UY79100015

Longer duration of seasonal stratification contributes to widespread increases in lake hypoxia and anoxia	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important attribute of aquatic ecosystems, influencing habitat, drinking water quality, biodiversity, nutrient biogeochemistry, and greenhouse gas emissions. While average summer DO concentrations are declining in lakes across the temperate zone, much remains unknown about seasonal factors contributing to deepwater DO losses. It is unclear whether declines are related to increasing rates of seasonal DO depletion or changes in seasonal stratification that limit re-oxygenation of deep waters. Furthermore, despite the presence of important biological and ecological DO thresholds, there has been no large-scale assessment of changes in the amount of habitat crossing these thresholds, limiting the ability to understand the consequences of observed DO losses. We used a dataset from >400 widely distributed lakes to identify the drivers of DO losses and quantify the frequency and volume of lake water crossing biologically and ecologically important threshold concentrations ranging from 5 to 0.5 mg/L. Our results show that while there were no consistent changes over time in seasonal DO depletion rates, over three-quarters of lakes exhibited an increase in the duration of stratification, providing more time for seasonal deepwater DO depletion to occur. As a result, most lakes have experienced summertime increases in the amount of water below all examined thresholds in deepwater DO concentration, with increases in the proportion of the water column below thresholds ranging between 0.9% and 1.7% per decade. In the 30-day period preceding the end of stratification, increases were greater at >2.2% per decade and >70% of analyzed lakes experienced increases in the amount of oxygen-depleted water. These results indicate ongoing climate-induced increases in the duration of stratification have already contributed to reduction of habitat for many species, likely increased internal nutrient loading, and otherwise altered lake chemistry. Future warming is likely to exacerbate these trends.					; Jane, Stephen/D-6659-2011; Lau, Maximilian/MIN-4633-2025; Lewis, Abby/GLT-1176-2022	Lau, Maximilian Peter/0000-0002-0675-663X; Stetler, Jonathan/0000-0003-1505-3693; Lewis, Abigail/0000-0001-9933-4542; Major-Mincer, Joshua/0000-0002-0351-6163; Jane, Stephen/0000-0003-2968-359X; Rose, Kevin/0000-0002-1292-9381; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				2022 DEC 6	2022										10.1111/gcb.16525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16525		DEC 2022						36472079					WOS:000895718800001

The model is shown to explain 55-72% of the total variation of these characteristics among various surface water systems within the Catskill and Adirondack mountain regions of New York. In addition, the model also explains 11-47% of the relative depression in ANC attributable to natural organic acidity in surface waters in these regions, The model is subsequently linked to an empirical equilibrium acidification model for predicting the long-term episodic acidification response of Adirondack lakes during snowmelt periods, Model predictions suggest that percentage decreases in sulfuric acid concentrations of the magnitude mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (40%) will not restore to positive values the ANC of ah Adirondack lakes which are currently acidic (ANC < 0) during spring snowmelt periods. Long-term increases in nitric acid concentrations may counterbalance the expected increases in ANC attributable to reductions in sulfur deposition.

(2152 m) provide the 1st postglacial bog, forest and fire history for the Bitterroot Mountains [USA]. The 6.27 m of sediment, dated by 16 radiocarbon dates and 2 volcanic ashes, represent lake, fen and bog deposition spanning the last 12,000 yr. Lycopodium spores were introduced as tracers into the 81 constant-volume samples to estimate pollen and charcoal influx. Because of considerable variation between samples, pollen and charcoal estimates were averaged by pollen zones. Glacial ice withdrew, leaving a lake by 12,000 yr ago, and sagebrush steppe dominated the landscape for the next 400-500 yr. If lodgepole and whitebark pine are the diploxylon and haploxylon pine pollen in the record, then by 11,500 yr ago whitebark pine forests replaced the steppe and persisted for the next 3000-4000 yr under climatic conditions that were probably cooler than present. Two falls of Glacier Peak volcanic ash, separated by less than 25 yr, occurred about 11,250 BP. By 7000 yr ago, under warmer but not necessarily drier climatic conditions, Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine replaced whitebark pine and charcoal influx increased. The fall of Mazama volcanic ash was dated at about 6700 yr ago. By 5000 yr ago aquatic, fen and bog microfossils became important. With the return to cooler climates, about 4000 yr ago, Douglas-fir was no longer common in the pine forest. Little vegetational change is indicated after 4000 yr ago. However, more charcoal was deposited during the last 2000 yr than during the previous 9500 yr.

The temporal variability of centimeter-scale surface roughness in a playa dust source: Synthetic aperture radar investigation of playa surface dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Emission of mineral dust aerosols is highly dynamic, in part due to variability in surface erodibility. Investigation of the variations of surfaces within dust source regions has the potential to elucidate the processes that control erodibility and to improve model representations of dust emission. In this study, we investigate surface temporal variability in the Black Rock playa (Nevada, USA) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data from between 2004 and 2010. The SAR backscatter (sigma(0)) observations of the playa surface are compared to weather station observations and temporally-resolved measurements of water inundation derived from multi-spectral MODIS satellite data. The data illustrate that centimeter-scale surface roughness on the playa is surprisingly heterogeneous over multi-meter length scales and evolves dynamically on annual time scales. Interannual changes in surface roughness on the playa are quite large compared to the variability of surface roughness during the summer months (July-September), suggesting that summer anthropogenic and aeolian processes are substantially less important than water-related processes for controlling the evolution of the playa surface. Playa median ob is relatively low in years with high annual precipitation (>140 mm), suggesting that surface water controls centimeter-scale surface roughness and, potentially, erodibility. Spatially, there is a relationship between ob and the time of year at which a surface dries. Areas drying in July have significantly higher ob than surfaces that dry earlier in the year, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity in ob is controlled by cycles of wetting and drying at the edge of the playa lake. The implications in the Black Rock playa, and potentially more broadly, are that water is a critical factor controlling playa surface evolution, and the annual time scale is crucial for investigations of playa erodibility.

SPECIATION OF COPPER IN THE LAKE MODRAC WATER WITH DPASV	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The protection of water is the basic goal in every country and it is realised through the increased concern about water and permanent monitoring of water quality. The Modrac lake is the biggest artificial lake in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is of particular importance for the Tuzla canton as one of the drinkable spring. Taking into consideration the environment of the Modrac lake and the great flowing in of waste water we performed monitoring of the copper content in the frame of the bio-geochemical metal circulation. The chemical form was defined and as well as the copper bio-availability based on the calculation of the stability constants (K) and capacity complexing (C(L)). Monitoring was performed through the seasons on four characteristic locations. The results showed that considerable amounts of active organic materials were present, particularly those with which copper forms realtively stable complexes.

Nutrient enrichment of water bodies has intensified eutrophication which degrades water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, we carried out a trend analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) catchment using a novel approach to analyse nutrient time series. Seasonal analysis of trends at each of the water quality stations was performed to determine the relationships between annual flow regimes and nutrient loads in the catchment, in particular, the influence of the high spring runoff on nutrient export. Decadal analysis was also performed to determine the long-term relationships of nutrients with anthropogenic changes in the catchment. Although it was found that seasonal and historical variability of nutrient load trends is mainly determined by streamflow regime changes, there is evidence that increases in nitrogen concentration can also be attributed to anthropogenic changes.					; Chun, Kwok Pan/P-5782-2018; Chun, Kwok/P-5782-2018; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/AFM-9194-2022	Morales-Marin, Luis Alejandro/0000-0003-4318-6194; Chun, Kwok Pan/0000-0001-9873-6240; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				APR	2017	62	4					657	679		10.1080/02626667.2016.1255747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2016.1255747													WOS:000399493900011

AQUACULTURE												In poikilothermic animals like fish, outbreaks of pathogen-related diseases are closely related with the temperature of the surrounding environment. Many salmonid fish species are thermally sensitive and therefore are especially endangered by thermal stress and habitat loss caused by increasing temperatures during summer heat waves. We hypothesized that combining thermal stress and the presence of a novel viral pathogen from for example aquaculture effluents may result in a potential host jump of the pathogen. This could be one of the mechanisms leading to an increased vulnerability of salmonids to a novel disease. Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) could be considered as one of the most dangerous emerging viruses affecting warm water aquaculture of Nile tilapia. This pathogen has a global reach with a yet to be defined host range. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for TiLV to infect salmonid hosts in a range of water temperatures which can be reached during summer heatwaves in Continental Europe. For this, it was established that TiLV can replicate in vitro in salmonid cells over the wide temperature range of 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The susceptibility of rainbow trout and brown trout juveniles to infection with TiLV was investigated in infection trials based on cohabitation and on intraperitoneal injection of the virus in elevated water temperatures of 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. These experiments showed that if the ability of the virus to enter the organism is considered, the susceptibility of rainbow and brown trout to the virus is low. The exposure of these salmonids to the virus by cohabitation did not lead to high virus loads in the liver and brain. However, the permissivity, i.e. the ability of the virus to replicate in the fish body, is high, because IPinjections of TiLV led to a high virus replication in internal organs. Therefore, TiLV could have some pathogenic potential in salmonids which might be exacerbated by climate change and anthropogenic activities.					techangamsuwan, somporn/JYO-5112-2024; Stachnik, Magdalena/GLT-8035-2022; surachetpong, win/JGM-8780-2023; Adamek, Mikolaj/I-7872-2012; Falco, Alberto/A-3250-2012; Abd El Rahman, Sahar/V-8285-2018; Piewbang, Chutchai/ABF-3395-2021	Adamek, Mikolaj/0000-0003-4890-3164; SURACHETPONG, WIN/0000-0002-5707-3476; Falco, Alberto/0000-0001-7726-6577; Abd El Rahman, Sahar/0000-0001-6417-8615; 													0044-8486	1873-5622				JUN 30	2023	571								739469	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739469		MAR 2023											WOS:001053566500001

Electrical conductivity as a driver of biological and geological spatial heterogeneity in the Puquios, Salar de Llamara, Atacama Desert, Chile	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Reputed to be the driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert in the Central Andes of Northern Chile is an extreme environment with high UV radiation, wide temperature variation, and minimum precipitation. Scarce lagoons associated with salt flats (salars) in this desert are the surface expression of shallow groundwater; these ponds serve as refugia for life and often host microbial communities associated with evaporitic mineral deposition. Results based on multidisciplinary field campaigns and associated laboratory examination of samples collected from the Puquios of the Salar de Llamara in the Atacama Desert during austral summer provide unprecedented detail regarding the spatial heterogeneity of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of these salar environments. Four main lagoons ('Puquios') and more than 400 smaller ponds occur within an area less than 5 km(2), and are characterized by high variability in electrical conductivity, benthic and planktonic biota, microbiota, lagoon bottom type, and style of mineral deposition. Results suggest that electrical conductivity is a driving force of system heterogeneity. Such spatial heterogeneity within the Puquios is likely to be expanded with temporal observations incorporating expected seasonal changes in electrical conductivity. The complexity of these Andean ecosystems may be key to their ability to persist in extreme environments at the edge of habitability.

The shallow, litter-accumulated water in those zones was inhabited by larvae of two species, Carassius spp. and Cyprinus carpio. More than 70% (by volume) of these shallow areas in Lake Biwa was estimated to be lost when the water level was artificially lowered by 30cm from June to October 1997. During the low water level period, significantly fewer eggs of these cyprinid fishes were collected in a reed zone than in April and May of the same year, a comparison with a previous study suggesting that spawning of the fishes was inhibited during the period of low water level. The artificial reductions in water level probably resulted in a significant decrease in the volume of shallow water in the lake and may be linked to the drastic decline in these cyprinid fishes.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2006	7	2					75	82		10.1007/s10201-006-0172-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0172-2													WOS:000239754000002

The samples were analysed for variation in the phytoplankton composition, and the total volume and volume of the main groups of algae were calculated. Lake Atnsjoen is a large, deep and unregulated lake with a surface area of 4.8 km(2) and a maximum depth of 80.2 m. It is a nutrient-poor, oligotrophic lake with a maximum phytoplankton volume varying between 125-393 mm(3)/m(3) in the years 1990-2000. The phytoplankton community is dominated by species of the groups Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae. The chrysophytes dominate the phytoplankton in the early part of the growth season (May-June) while the cryptophytes increase throughout the season and dominate in the autumn. Among the chrysophytes different species of chrysomonads were most frequent together with common species of the genus Dinobryon like D. borgei, D. cylindricum var. alpinum and D. crenulatum. A total of 22 species or taxa of chrysophytes were recorded in the samples. Common among the cryptomonads were several species of the genus Cryptomonas. Most important quantitatively, however, were Rhodomonas lacustris and Katablepharis ovalis. The succesion of the phytoplankton throughout the growth season was similar from year to year in quantitative as well as qualitative terms, but some changes were recorded after the great flood in 1995. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) shows a slight, but significant, phytoplankton community change over the succeeding years.																			0018-8158					JUN	2004	521	1-3					141	147		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026356.09421.e3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026356.09421.e3													WOS:000221177900012

We analysed fluctuations of stock size, age structure, spawning time, and amount of sampled eggs of this species. The onset of spawning altered because of changes in the age structure of the stock. We found a clear relation of spawning time to the mean age of the annual catch and the November epilimnion temperature. The quantity of eggs sampled from the lake bottom with a dredge is in relation to the number of female spawners and may serve as an early indicator for stock size changes. The proportion of viable eggs on the lake floor correlates with oxygen concentrations in deep water. Extremely low oxygen conditions and an almost total loss of eggs occurred when the nutrient levels were high and oxygen regeneration by vertical winter mixing was weak. A mathematical model serves to interpret the changing abundance of living eggs on the lake bottom over the course of a season and is also used to estimate mortality rates.																			0706-652X					APR	2009	66	4					547	556		10.1139/F09-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-019													WOS:000267811300004

Here, we test these hypotheses using Plio-Pleistocene estimates of paleotemperatures and paleoelevations in the NETP derived from oxygen and carbon stable isotopic composition (n = 792) and clumped isotope measurements (n = 32) sediment core, eastern NETP. From 5 to 2 Ma, basinal mean annual air temperatures (MAATs) decreased by 4.9 +/- 2.8 degrees C at rates of 1.6 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C/myr, concurrently with regional and global cooling. However, the largest MAAT decline occurs between ca. 4.8-3.7 Ma (4.1 +/- 3.2 degrees C) and ca. 3.4-2.0 Ma elevation change of 1.0 +/- 1.0 km at 3.6 Ma, results suggest a combination of global cool ing and a small magnitude of surface uplift (<1 km) at ca. 3.6 Ma may have contributed to the regional evolution of climate in the Lake Qinghai Basin.

Meteorological data were used as the model input. The novel model features were advanced treatment of superimposed ice and turbulent heat fluxes, coupling of snow and ice layers and snow modelled from precipitation. The simulated snow, snow-ice and ice thickness showed good agreement with observations for 2008-2009. Modelled ice climatology was also reasonable, with 0.5 cm d(-1) growth in December-March and 2 cm d(-1) melting in April. Tuned heat flux from water to ice was 0.5 W m(-2). The diurnal weather cycle gave significant impact on ice thickness in spring. Ice climatology was highly sensitive to snow conditions. Surface temperature showed strong dependency on thickness of thin ice (<0.5 m), supporting the feasibility of thermal remote sensing and showing the importance of lake ice in numerical weather prediction. The lake ice season responded strongly to air temperature: a level increase by 1 or 5 degrees C decreased the mean length of the ice season by 13 or 78 d (from 152 d) and the thickness of ice by 6 or 22 cm (from 50 cm), respectively.

This study describes and analyzes the main limnological characteristics of 54 Argentine Patagonian lakes located between 38 degrees and 55 degrees S latitude. By principal components analysis of summer data, three basic types of Patagonian lakes were identified: Andean, ecotone and plateau. These groups were distributed across a gradient defined mainly by trophic and edaphic characteristics, and secondarily by lake morphometry and climatic factors. Most lakes deeper than 50 m showed summer stratification, with a mean thermocline depth of 38 m. Thermocline depth showed a direct correlation with latitude. The best single predictors of thermocline depth were fetch and lake area. Thermocline depth was not only deeper than predicted by northern hemisphere models, but also deeper than in other southern hemisphere lakes of similar surface area located in Chile and New Zealand. Surface water temperatures were correlated with latitude. Only north ern Patagonian lakes showed significant differences in surface water temperatures on both sides of the Andes. The best single predictors of chlorophyll were Secchi disk depth and mean depth. Models from the literature overestimated chlorophyll concentrations for Argentine Patagonian lakes, particularly under eutrophic conditions. We suggest that cold-temperate lakes in Argentina differ in their thermal regime from northern hemisphere lakes at equivalent latitudes, owing to the Marked oceanic influence on the southern hemisphere land mass, together with the strong and persistent westerly winds. These features coupled with lower nutrient contents make the use of global models inadequate for Argentine cold-temperate lakes.																			0003-9136					NOV	1995	135	1					23	51																WOS:A1995TJ57300002
J	Weithoff, G; Gaedke, U				Weithoff, Guntram; Gaedke, Ursula			Mean functional traits of lake phytoplankton reflect seasonal and inter-annual changes in nutrients, climate and herbivory	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Trait-based approaches have become increasingly successful in community ecology. They assume that the distribution of functional traits within communities responds in a predictable way to alterations in environmental forcing and that strong forcing may accelerate such trait changes. We used high frequency measurements of phytoplankton to test these assumptions. We analyzed the seasonal and long-term dynamics of the community trait mean within a multi-dimensional trait space under alternating multifactorial environmental conditions. The community trait mean exhibited a distinct recurrent annual pattern that reflected minor changes in climate, herbivory and nutrients. Independent of early spring conditions, the community trait mean was repeatedly driven into a narrow confined area in the trait space under pronounced herbivory during the clear water phase. The speed of movement was highest at the onset and the relaxation of such strong unidirectional forcing. Thus, our data support the conceptual framework of trait-based ecology that alterations in environmental conditions are systematically tracked by adjustments in the dominant functional trait values and that the speed of trait changes depends on the kind and intensity of the selection pressure. Our approach provides a sensitive tool to detect small functional differences in the community related to subtle differences in forcing.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					509	517		10.1093/plankt/fbw072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbw072													WOS:000402613800012

Analysis of the dates of formation of reaction wood among destabilized trees at the base of a wooded backshore yielded a time-space framework for erosion phases related to extreme flood events. Two high-water periods were depicted: the 1920s and 1970s, while a regression of forest margins occurred in response to increasing geomorphic activity on the upper shore. Relatively low-level stages in the 1910s, and during the 1930-1950 period, favoured forest colonization of the upper beach sediments. Since the 1970s, there has been a noticeable rise in the frequency and magnitude of floods. Winter floods are now frequent due to changes in pluvio-thermal regimes and man-made flood controls works in the Great Lakes and on affluents. As a result of increasing cold-season flood activity, shore susceptibility to drift ice action intensifies.																			0705-7199						1992	46	2					173	180		10.7202/032901ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032901ar													WOS:A1992JR37800004

A millennial summer temperature reconstruction for northeastern Canada using oxygen isotopes in subfossil trees	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Climatic reconstructions for northeastern Canada are scarce such that this area is under-represented in global temperature reconstructions. To fill this lack of knowledge and identify the most important processes influencing climate variability, this study presents the first summer temperature reconstruction for eastern Canada based on a millennial oxygen isotopic series (delta O-18) from tree rings. For this purpose, we selected 230 well-preserved subfossil stems from the bottom of a boreal lake and five living trees on the lakeshore. The sampling method permitted an annually resolved delta O-18 series with a replication of five trees per year. The June to August maximal temperature of the last millennium has been reconstructed using the statistical relation between Climatic Research Unit (CRU TS3.1) and delta O-18 data. The resulting millennial series is marked by the well-defined Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; AD 1000-1250), the Little Ice Age (AD 1450-1880) and the modern period (AD 1950-2010), and an overall average cooling trend of -0.6 A degrees C millennium(-1). These climatic periods and climatic low-frequency trends are in agreement with the only reconstruction available for northeastern Canada and others from nearby regions (Arctic, Baffin Bay) as well as some remote regions like the Canadian Rockies or Fennoscandia. Our temperature reconstruction indicates that the Medieval Climate Anomaly was characterized by a temperature range similar to the one of the modern period in the study region. However, the temperature increase during the last 3 decades is one of the fastest warming observed over the last millennium (+1.9 A degrees C between 1970-2000). An additional key finding of this research is that the coldest episodes mainly coincide with low solar activities and the extremely cold period of the early 19th century has occurred when a solar minimum was in phase with successive intense volcanic eruptions. Our study provides a new perspective unraveling key mechanisms that controlled the past climate shifts in northeastern Canada.

Persistence of the sulfonylurea herbicides thifensulfuron-methyl, ethametsulfuron-methyl, and metsulfuron-methyl in farm dugouts (Ponds)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Sulfonylurea herbicides are applied at relatively low rates (3 to 40 g ha(-1)) to control weeds in a variety of crops across the Canadian prairies. Because of their high phytotoxicity and the likelihood of their transport in surface runoff, there is concern about their possible impact to aquatic ecosystems. Little is known, however, about their persistence and behavior in aquatic ecosystems. To assess persistence in aquatic ecosystems, three prairie farm dugouts (ponds) were fortified with either thifensulfuron-methyl {methyl 3-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5triazin-2-yl)aminojcarbonyllamino]sulfonyl]-2-thiophenecarboxylate), ethametsulfuron-methyl {methyl 2-[[[[[4-ethoxy-6-(methylamino)-1,3,5triazin-2-yl]amino]carbonyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzoate}) or metsulforon-methyl {methyl 2-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazinyl)amino]carbonyl] amino]sulfonyl]benzoate). The decreasing order of persistence of environmentally relevant concentrations (1 to 4.6 mu g L-1) of these herbicides in dugout water over the June to October period was metsulfuron-methyl > ethametsulfuron-methyl > thifensulfuron-methyl. The corresponding dissipation half-lives (DT50) of 84, 30, and 16 d, respectively, are in the same relative order as the recropping intervals for these herbicides. Thifensulfuron-methyl showed a biphasic dissipation with slower dissipation during the winter months. In contrast, the dissipation of metsulfuron-methyl, the sulfonylurea herbicide with the longest DT50, was somewhat enhanced under winter conditions. One of the major routes of sulfonylurea herbicide dissipation was removal from the water column when dugout water was lost during hydrological discharge. The relatively long persistence of these herbicides in water indicates that partitioning into sediments was minimal, the suffonylurea and methyl ester linkages in these compounds were resistant to hydrolysis in weakly alkaline waters, and that microbial and photolytic degradation in dugout waters were slow.																			0047-2425					NOV-DEC	2006	35	6					2395	2401		10.2134/jeq2005.0462	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.0462								17071910					WOS:000242135300047

The role of climate in the accumulation of lithium-rich brine in the Central Andes	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Lithium-rich brine within the sub-surface of the Salar del Hombre Muerto (SHM) salt pan in the Andes of northwestern Argentina has a chemical and isotopic composition which is consistent with Li derived from several sources: the modern halite saturated lagoon, Li-rich salts and brines formed recently, and dissolution of halite which precipitated from ancient saline lakes. SHM lies in the closed basin that includes part of the massive Cerro Galan caldera which is drained by the Rio los Patos, which is responsible for 90% of surface runoff into the salar. The low Li isotope composition, +3.4 parts per thousand, of this river is consistent with significant contributions of geothermal spring water. As water drains through the volcaniclastic deposits which cover a large proportion of the basin, Li removal, as indicated by decreasing Li/Na, occurs but without significant isotope fractionation. This indicates a mechanism of surface sorption onto smectite or ferrihydrite rather than Li incorporation into octahedral structural sites of clays. These observations suggest that conditions in this high altitude desert have limited the dilution of hydrothermal spring water as well as the formation of clay minerals, which jointly have allowed the Li resource to accumulate rapidly. Changes in climate on a multi-millennial time scale, specifically in the hydrologic budget, have resulted in solute accumulation rates that have been variable through time, and decoupled Li and Na fluxes. Inflow to the salar under modern conditions has high Li/ Na (7.9 x 10(-3) by wt) with delta Li-7 indistinguishable from basement rocks (-0.3 parts per thousand to + 6.4 parts per thousand), while under pluvial climate conditions the Li/Na of the saline lake was 40 times lower than the modern lagoon (0.1-0.3 x 10(-3) compared to 10.6-13.4 x 10(-3)) with slightly higher delta Li-7, + 6.9 parts per thousand to + 12.3 parts per thousand, reflecting the uptake of Li-6 into secondary minerals which formed under a wetter climate.

Nigel; Egan, Fintan; Dillane, Mary; Maoileidigh, Niall o.; Moore, Andy			Temporal and spatial use of a freshwater lake by upstream and downstream migrating adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Atlantic salmon Salmo salar typically enter fresh water several months prior to spawning and just as pools can provide areas of refuge in river systems, lakes may also provide important refuge habitat during the spawning migration. Using acoustic telemetry we examined the spatial and temporal movements of wild and a ranched strain of Atlantic salmon in a freshwater lake where the main spawning areas were located upstream of the lake. Over the study period (2011-2014), returning adult wild salmon spent an average of 228 days in fresh water and 90% of that time in the lake. On entering the lake, most wild salmon moved quickly to the northern part of the lake, close to the main inflow, spending an average 76% of the time in this location. The average number of days wild fish were absent from the lake during the main spawning period varied between years, ranging from 10 to 26 days for females and 32 to 35 days for males. Seventy four per cent (17/23) of salmon spawners returned to the lake and two salmon subsequently died in the lake post-spawning. Atypically, two salmon were resident in the lake for the whole period in 2013/14. During the study, wild salmon were detected at depths within the top 5 m for 73% of the time. Median depths post-spawning were greater than in the pre-spawning period, when salmon were found to spend extensive periods at depths in excess of 10 m. In July 2013, when the lake was stratified, thermal regulation behaviour was observed in wild salmon, whereby salmon moved to cooler deeper water when water temperatures at 1 m exceeded 20 degrees C. In contrast to wild salmon, the majority of ranch salmon returned to the traps downstream of the lake prior to the spawning period, which would be expected as they were released as smolts below the freshwater lake. Ranch fish spent an average 80% of the time in the vicinity of receivers in the south of the lake and an average 98% of the time within the top 5 m. However, two ranch females were resident in the lake until the following spring and one ranch female moved upstream into the river during the spawning period. Clearly, in this catchment the lake provides an important habitat for migrating adult salmon. In the context of climate change, where thermal and hydrological regimes in rivers are expected to change in response to changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns, the availability of deep lakes that stratify in the summer and cool water refuges in river systems is likely to play a key role in the sustenance and conservation of salmonid species. Information about the migration patterns of Atlantic salmon in undisturbed freshwater systems may also assist in resolving issues associated with fish passage in impacted rivers and inform management decisions.																				1095-8649				FEB	2025	106	2					492	513		10.1111/jfb.15953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15953		OCT 2024						39439419					WOS:001338150000001

At all stations the consistent appearance of significant spectral peaks and changes in wind direction at the diurnal frequency indicates the importance of lake-land breezes. It is shown that the surrounding topography has a strong modifying effect (temporal and spatial) on the lake-land breeze. Superimposed on this cyclic wind pattern, short episodes of strong winds with long fetch over parts of Lake Geneva are regularly observed. Both of these winds exert a spatially variable wind stress over the lake surface on the same time scale. Typical examples of the expected lake's response are presented, among them the seasonally persistent gyre in the central part of the lake. Evidence is provided that this dominant circulation is part of a direct cyclonic circulation, generated by the curl of the diurnal wind field. It is concluded that the mean circulation is caused by these winds and affected by the topography of the surrounding land.																			0992-7689					NOV	1996	14	11					1207	1220		10.1007/s005850050384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s005850050384													WOS:A1996VT49000013

Reducing bias in Coregonus artedi abundance estimates using stationary up-looking acoustics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mobile hydroacoustic surveys using ship-based down-looking transducers are widely used to estimate densities for ecologically and economically important pelagic fishes. However, this method likely underestimates densities of some surface-oriented species due to biases associated with the acoustic surface exclusion zone and ship avoidance behaviours. We compared cisco (Coregonus artedi) density estimates from a stationary up-looking platform survey to a standard down-looking acoustic survey. Both systems were deployed during the fall cisco spawn in Thunder Bay, Lake Superior 2020-2022. Cisco density estimates from the stationary up-looking platform were on average 6.7 times higher in the upper water column (similar to 1-10 m) and 2 times higher over the entire water column (similar to 1-45 m) than those from standard mobile surveys. Ship avoidance behaviour associated with mobile surveys was apparent in the upper water column; median cisco densities observed by the platform fell from similar to 36 to similar to 9 fish/ha when the ship passed near the platform. Abundance estimates from the platform when not influenced by ship avoidance provided higher quota estimates than the standard survey in 2020 and 2022, but were similar in 2021. A multi-day deployment of the platform tracked a progressive daily increase in fish densities, highlighting the sensitivity of mobile survey results to the day they are conducted, often dictated by environmental conditions. Our results show promise in applying stationary acoustic deployments in fisheries surveys, with improved accuracy and reduced effort compared to mobile acoustic surveys in the management and monitoring of pelagic fishes in the Great Lakes.					; Grow, Ryan/AAR-4441-2021	Grow, Ryan/0000-0002-9716-8779; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759													0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102456	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102456		JAN 2025											WOS:001411482200001
J	PENTECOST, A				PENTECOST, A			CARBONATE CHEMISTRY OF SURFACE WATERS IN A TEMPERATE KARST REGION - THE SOUTHERN YORKSHIRE DALES, UK	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A detailed study of surface water chemistry is described from an important limestone region in northern England. Major ions and pH were determined for 485 sites (springs, seeps, streams, rivers and lakes) during summertime. The saturation state of the waters with respect to calcite was determined as the calcite saturation ratio (OMEGA). An unexpectedly large number of samples were found to be supersaturated (65.5% of the 268 km of watercourses surveyed). As a consequence, several streams entering major cave systems were incapable of further limestone solution, at least during periods of low flow. Many waters were supersaturated from their source and some deposited travertine. A significant negative correlation was found between spring discharge and both (OMEGA) and pH. Supersaturation was caused primarily by atmospheric degassing, with some contribution from aquatic plant photosynthesis. The median total dissolved inorganic carbon and Ca concentrations were 2.49 and 1.35 millimoles l-1 respectively. Calcium originated exclusively from limestone, and carbon dioxide mainly from the soil and dissolved limestone. South facing catchments provided springwaters with significantly higher levels of TDIC and Ca when compared with north facing catchments. The study suggests that acid rain made a measurable contribution to limestone dissolution. Carboniferous limestone denudation rates were estimated as 54 to 63 m3 km-2 a-1 (54 to 63 mm 1000 years-1). About 50% of the Mg came from limestone and the remainder, together with most K, Na, SO4 and Cl from precipitation. Concentrations of dissolved nutrients were low, medians for NO3, NH4, total PO4 and SiO3 were 24 mumol, 1.4 mumol, 0.64 mumol and 15.5 mumol l-1 respectively. The concentration of a further 23 trace elements was determined.																			0022-1694					NOV	1992	139	1-4					211	232		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90203-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90203-8													WOS:A1992KF74500013

We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to study bacterial diversity and structure of PA and FL communities. The analysis rendered 37 985 highly qualified reads, subsequently assigned to 1755 operational taxonomic units (97% similarity) for the 8 samples. Although 27 high-level taxonomic groups were obtained, the 3 dominant phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) comprised about 75.9% and 82.4% of the PA and FL fractions, respectively. Overall, we found no significant differences between community types, as indicated by ANOSIM R statistics (R = 0.063, P > 0.05) and the Parsimony test (P = 0.222). Dynamics of bacterial communities were correlated with changes in concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP). In summer, a significant taxonomic overlap in the 2 size fractions was observed when Cyanobacteria, a major contributor of TSS and TP, dominated in the water, highlighting the potential rapid exchange between PA and FL bacterial populations in large shallow eutrophic lakes.

L.; Domnich, A., V; Zhukov, O., V			Multiscale oscillations of the annual course of temperature affect the spawning events of rudd (Scardinus erythrophthalmus)	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS												Identifying climate impacts on ecosystems and their components requires observing time series of sufficient length to ensure adequate statistical power and reasonable coverage of the historical range of variability inherent in the system. The complexity of the hierarchy of climate effects reflected in temporal patterns in time series creates a need to be accurately modeled. The life cycle phenomena of living organisms, including fish spawning, have the character of one-time or time-limited events in time. An approach to finding the relationship between continuous components of time dynamics of environment properties and life cycle events of living organisms was proposed. This approach allowed us to evaluate the role of temperature patterns in the phenology of spawning rudd (Scardinus erythrophthalmus Linnaeus, 1758) in the Dnipro River basin water bodies. The atmospheric temperature time series may be decomposed into the following components: trend, annual cycle, episodic component, harmonic component, extreme events, and noise. Systematically low water temperatures at the beginning of the spawning period were observed in the Protoka River system and the Obukhov floodplain, and systematically elevated temperatures were recorded in the Dnipro River. The annual temperature dynamics was shown to be presented as a composition of oscillatory processes of different scale levels. The sinusoidal trend was previously extracted from the temperature series data. The average annual temperature, amplitude, and phase shift were calculated on the basis of the sinusoidal regression model. The residuals of the sinusoidal trend were processed by means of redundancy analysis with variables derived from symmetric distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps as explanatory predictors. A set of 104 orthogonal dbMEM variables was extracted from the annual time series. These temporal variables were divided into the broad-, medium-, and fine-scale components. The parameters of temperature dynamics and biotope type are able to explain 51-72% of variability of spawning event. The time of spawning in water bodies corresponds to the time of spawning start: the earlier spawning starts, the earlier it ends. The duration of the spawning season is influenced by the patterns of different scale levels, as well as the amplitude and shift of phases. In this case, the duration of spawning in all water bodies does not differ. Spawning temperature depends on medium- and fine-scale temperature patterns, but does not depend on the characteristics of the sinusoidal annual trend. The annual temperature variation has been shown to be such that it can be decomposed into a sinusoidal trend, patterns of a multiscale nature, and a random fraction. Over the time range studied, the trend of increasing mean annual temperature was not statistically significant for spawning events. The sinusoidal trend explains 78.3-87.6% of the temperature variations and depends on the mean annual temperature, the amplitude of temperature variations during the year, and the earlier or later seasons of the year. Amplitude and phase shift play a role in describing spawning phenology. The residuals of the sinusoidal trend have been explained using dbMEM variables. This variation was decomposed into large-scale, medium-scale, and small-scale components. Winter and spring temperature fluctuations prior to spawning initiation had the greatest effect on spawning. Water temperature determines the lower possible limit for the start of spawning, but the actual start of spawning is determined by the preceding temperature dynamics. The results of the study have implications for understanding the dynamics of fish populations and assessing the influence of environmental conditions on the harmonization of the various components of ecosystems.

For the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America, reports on DP have been limited to sediment and fish, not known for birds, and regardless temporal trends in Great Lakes wildlife is unknown, In the present study, syn- and anti-DP isomers were detected in egg pools spanning 1982-2006 of a Great Lakes biomonitoring species, the herring gull (Larus argentatus), from seven colonies in the five Laurentian Great Lakes. The sum (Sigma) of syn- and anti-DP concentrations were generally <15 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) and variable depending on the colonial site and year, although Sigma-DP concentrations were generally higher post mid-1990s for all sites. Syn- and anti-DP concentrations ranged from 3.1 x 10(2) to 1.4 x 10(3) pg g(-1) ww and 1.3 x 10(2) to 4.4 x 10(3) pg g(-1) ww, respectively. There was a weak but significant (r(S) = -0.31, p < 0.001) negative relationship between the Sigma-DP concentration and the distance for the only DP production facility in North America at Niagara Falls, New York. However, the fraction of the anti-DP to the Sigma-DP concentration (f(anti)) was 0.69 +/- 0.08 (for all seven colonies and years, n = 101 pools), and there was no significant (r(S) = -0.18, p = 0.07) negative relationship off with increasing distance from the production facility at Niagara Falls, New York, which indicated that there was no temporal or spatial enrichment of either isomer relative to the commercial DP mixture. Over the past 25 years, it is clear that DP isomers have accumulated in the food web of female herring gulls with subsequent transfer during ovogenesis.

Total gill concentrations of metallothionein (MT) were determined by the (203)Hg saturation method for molluscs from each lake, and the distribution of Cd among various cytosolic ligands, including MT, was determined by size-exclusion chromatography. Gill MT concentrations responded to environmental exposure to Cd but not to Cu or Zn exposure; these spatial variations along the Cd gradient were more important than the seasonal summer variations in gill MT concentrations. Bivalves exposed to concentrations of dissolved free Cd(2+) higher than similar to 1 nM in the external medium exhibited a marked increase of Cd in the low relative molecular mass ligand pool, Symptoms of toxic effects at different levels of biological organization were associated with this biochemical anomaly.

Pathogen prevalence and abundance in honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination	APIDOLOGIE												Honey bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops. Since 2006, US beekeepers have experienced high annual honey bee colony losses, which may be attributed to multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including pathogens. However, the relative importance of these factors has not been fully elucidated. To identify the most prevalent pathogens and investigate the relationship between colony strength and health, we assessed pathogen occurrence, prevalence, and abundance in Western US honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination. The most prevalent pathogens were Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Nosema ceranae, and trypanosomatids. Our results indicated that pathogen prevalence and abundance were associated with both sampling date and beekeeping operation, that prevalence was highest in honey bee samples obtained immediately after almond pollination, and that weak colonies had a greater mean pathogen prevalence than strong colonies.

Consistent with other studies within the Great Lakes, Mantra-trawl samples were dominated by particles less than 1 mm in size. Enumeration of collected plastics under a microscope found fragments to be the most common anthropogenic particle type, followed by fibers, with more minor contributions from pellets, films and foams. The majority of these pelagic plastic particles were found to be polyethylene, with polypropylene being the second most common polymeric type, which is consistent with manufacturing trends and beach survey results. The pelagic plastic was found to be fairly evenly distributed across the entire Lake Michigan surface, despite the formation of a seasonal gyre at the southern end of the lake. We found that an average plastic abundance of similar to 17,000 particles/km(2), which when multiplied by the total surface area, gives on the order of 1 billion plastic particles floating on the surface of Lake Michigan. As the majority of these particles are extremely small, less than 1 mm in size, which allows for easy ingestion, these results highlight the need for additional studies with regard to the possible impacts upon aquatic organisms.

Use of Molecular Techniques to Confirm Nonnative Fish Predation on Razorback Sucker Larvae in Lake Mohave, Arizona and Nevada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Larval predation by nonnative fishes has long been implicated in the decline of western native large-river fishes, but visual assessment of predation is difficult due to the postconsumption degradation of fragile larvae. Molecular techniques were used to demonstrate predation on the larvae of endangered Razorback Suckers Xyrauchen texanus by nonnative juvenile centrarchids in field samples from Lake Mohave, Arizona-Nevada, where larvae are seasonally abundant. Razorback Sucker DNA was detected in the gut contents of 7% and 9% of Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and in 14% and 15% of Green Sunfish L. cyanellus that were captured during spring 2014 and 2015, respectively. There was no significant (alpha = 0.05) effect of predator TL, predator species, or year on the presence of larval DNA. Juvenile centrarchids have the potential to consume substantial numbers of Razorback Sucker larvae and thus to impact recruitment. The control of nonnative fishes may be impractical, but a viable alternative for mitigation of their impacts is to provide nonnative-free refugia for native large-river fishes.

The seasonal and spatial variations in the concentrations of the dissolved ions were examined and the major contaminant sources were identified using multiple isotopes. All streams exhibited gradual increases in Cl, NO3, and SO4 concentrations as water flowed downstream; the water types were changed from Ca-HCO3 to Ca-(Cl, NO3, SO4). Combined delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) data revealed that the dissolved NO3 was mainly derived from manure or sewage, with partial contributions from NH4 fertilizer in summer. The delta S-34(SO4) and SO4 concentrations in the stream waters indicated that the dissolved sulfates were derived from contaminants, such as sewage, detergent, and chemical fertilizer supplied discriminately to each stream along its course. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios combined with the Sr and Cl concentrations suggest that sewage associated with chemical fertilizer rather than detergent contributed significantly to the dissolved Sr in all the streams.

Two new national records were discovered, both from southernmost Ontario: P. cephalicus Fall and P. luctuosus Suffrian. Four species were new provincial records: P. cephalicus (ON), P. luctuosus (ON, QC), P. obsoletus Suffrian (NB), P. peccans (PE). A fully illustrated key to the Pachybrachis of eastern Canada is provided and supported with extensive photographs, distribution maps, and plant associations. Three species were distributed from southern Ontario into at least one province in the Maritimes (P. nigricornis (Say), P. obsoletus Suffrian and P. peccans Suffrian). Six species were distributed along the shores of the Great Lakes (Erie, Michigan, and Ontario) and rivers (Ottawa, Saguenay and St. Lawrence), but unknown from central and northern ON and QC (P. bivittatus (Say), P. hepaticus hepaticus (F. E. Melsheimer), P. othonus othonus (Say), P. pectoralis (F. E. Melsheimer), P. spumarius Suffrian and P. trinotatus (F. E. Melsheimer)). Seven species were rare, five being found exclusively from southern ON (P. calcaratus Fall, P. cephalicus, P. luridus (Fabricius), P. subfasciatus (J. E. LeConte) and P. tridens (F. E. Melsheimer)), with two having, in addition, a disjunct population in QC (P. atomarius (F. E. Melsheimer) and P. luctuosus). One species was found to be the northern most extension of an eastern United States (US) distribution into the eastern townships of QC (P. m-nigrum (F. E. Melsheimer)). There were no Pachybrachis that could be considered arctic, subarctic, or boreal species; no specimens were found from Labrador and Newfoundland, and all species had southern affinities. Pachybrachis atomarius, P. calcaratus, P. luridus, P. subfaciatus, and P. tridens, not seen over the last 30-70 years, may be extirpated from eastern Canada.																			1313-2989						2013		332			SI		95	175		10.3897/zookeys.332.4753	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.332.4753								24163583					WOS:000324629300005

Vegetative survival of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Cyanobacteria) at low temperature and low light	HYDROBIOLOGIA					17th workshop of the International Association for Phytoplankton Taxonomy and Ecology (IAP)	SEP 14-21, 2014	Kastoria, GREECE					Invasive neophytic species such as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii often pose a problem in many regions world-wide. The mechanisms of expansion are not fully understood. Occurrence and survival of the species at unusual ambient conditions are re-analysed from an earlier study to test the ability to survive in the vegetative form at water temperatures below 12A degrees C. Results indicate that vegetative existence at low temperatures and light in the two periods analysed benefited from weather conditions exceeding long-term average climatic records. Winter survival enables the species to re-establish a population when conditions become favourable again. Such metabolic adaptations will allow the species to expand to and thrive in novel environments particularly if weather conditions due to climate warming change.

To identify spatial data gaps, those CEE-TV records for which the specific study location were known (n = 2,740) were combined with watershed and wildlife management unit boundaries using Geographic Information Systems software. The US Environmental Protection Agency's Index of Watershed Indicators (IWI), which classifies watersheds based on water quality and their vulnerability to pollution, was used to prioritize these data gaps. Of 136 watersheds in the study area, 15 that are classified by the IWI as having water quality problems or high vulnerability to pollution lacked terrestrial vertebrate ecotoxicological monitoring or research in the past decade. Older studies within some of these watersheds documented high levels of contaminants in wildlife tissues. Of 90 National Wildlife Refuge units, 42 without current data fall within watersheds of concern. Of 40 National Park units larger than I km, 17 without current data fall within watersheds of concern. Issues encountered in this analysis highlighted the need for spatially and temporally replicated field monitoring programs that utilize random sampling. Without data from such studies, it will be difficult to perform unbiased assessments of regional trends in contaminant exposure and effects in terrestrial vertebrates.

Life histories of two hyperbenthic mysids (Mysidacea: Mysidae) in an open estuary	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Mysidae are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems and form a large proportion of the hyperbenthic biomass in estuaries. The seasonality, spatial distribution and reproductive biology of the two hyperbenthic mysid species, Tenagomysis chiltoni and Tenagomysis novaezealandiae, were studied in an open estuary. Sampling was conducted bi-monthly at night between February 2008 and April 2009. These two mysid species are spatially segregated along a salinity gradient, with T. chiltoni upstream and T. novaezealandiae downstream in the estuary. The life cycle and breeding dynamics of T. chiltoni (bivoltine life cycle) and T. novaezealandiae (multivoltine life cycle) were similar to those described in intermittently closed estuaries, but their breeding period (December to April) was relatively shorter and densities were lower. Life-stage specific segregation in summer in both mysid species likely provided favourable conditions for maximum growth rates, short maturation times, and sheltering, enhancing reproductive success of both mysid species.

The Animikie Basin in the Lake Superior region has been essential in shaping our view of marine redox evolution over this time period. In this study, we present a multi-proxy paleoredox investigation of previously unanalyzed strata of the late Paleoproterozoic Animikie Basin using drill cores through the similar to 1.85 Ga Stambaugh Formation (Paint River Group) in the Iron River-Crystal Falls district of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Based on previous tectonic reconstructions and analysis of sedimentary regimes, the Iron River-Crystal Falls section captures strata from among the deepest-water facies of the Animikie Basin. In contrast to previous work on sedimentary rocks in this basin, we find evidence from iron speciation, trace metal, and Mo isotope data for episodes of at least local deep-water oxygenation within a basin otherwise dominated by ferruginous and euxinic conditions. While tracemetal enrichments and iron speciation data suggest predominantly anoxic conditions, the occurrence of Mn-rich intervals (up to 12.3 wt% MnO) containing abundant Mn-Fe carbonate, and a wide range of Mo isotope data with extremely negative values (delta Mo-98/95=-1.0 to + 1.1%), record the shuttling of Mn-oxides from surface waters through oxic or suboxic waters to the sediment-water interface. We propose that such conditions are analogous to those of locally restricted modern and Holocene basins in the Baltic Sea, which receive episodic inflow of oxygenated water, producing similar geochemical signatures to those observed for the Animikie Basin. We argue that the mid-Proterozoic was characterized by a lack of a strong redox buffer (low sulfide, ferrous iron, and oxygen contents), and thus was vulnerable to dramatic, and at least local, redox shifts-including briefly oxygenated bottom waters. A refined view of the mid-Proterozoic ocean is emerging: one that was still predominantly anoxic, but marked by regional heterogeneities and short-term redox variability that may, in part, reflect a transitional state between prevailingly anoxic Archean and predominantly oxic Phanerozoic oceans.					; Bekker, Andrey/KMA-0448-2024; Beerling, David/C-2840-2009; Lyons, Timothy/ADT-8795-2022	O'Connell, Brennan/0000-0002-5652-1222; Bekker, Andrey/0000-0002-1154-0585; Asael, Dan/0000-0002-4703-6081; Hardisty, Dalton/0000-0002-9434-081X; 													0009-2541	1878-5999				APR 20	2018	483						581	594		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.03.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.03.028													WOS:000429492300047

However, the effect of urbanization on the phenology of subtropical vegetation remains relatively unexplored. This study analyzed the changing trend of vegetation photosynthetic phenology in Dongting Lake basin, China, and its response to urbanization using nighttime light and chlorophyll fluorescence datasets. Our results indicated the start of the growing season (SOS) of vegetation in the study area was significantly advanced by 0.70 days per year, whereas the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by 0.24 days per year during 2000-2017. We found that urbanization promoted the SOS advance and EOS delay. With increasing urbanization intensity, the sensitivity of SOS to urbanization firstly increased then decreased, while the sensitivity of EOS to urbanization decreased with urbanization intensity. The climate sensitivity of vegetation phenology varied with urbanization intensity; urbanization induced an earlier SOS by increasing preseason minimum temperatures and a later EOS by increasing preseason precipitation. These findings improve our understanding of the vegetation phenology response to urbanization in subtropical regions and highlight the need to integrate human activities into future vegetation phenology models.

Identification of blind geothermal resources in Surprise Valley, CA, using publicly available groundwater well water quality data	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Geothermal resource exploration is generally limited to areas with surface expressions of thermal activity (fumaroles and hot springs), or relies on expensive geophysical exploration techniques. In this study, the hidden subsurface distribution of geothermal fluids has been identified using a free and publicly available water quality dataset from agricultural and domestic water wells in Surprise Valley, northeastern California. Thermally evolved waters in Surprise Valley have element ratios that vary in response to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation, and have elevated total dissolved solids (TDS). The arid climate in Surprise Valley leads to surface water evaporation in a closed basin, producing high TDS Na-Cl-CO3-SO4 brines in three ephemeral alkali lakes and in shallow groundwater under elevated soil CO2 conditions. Evaporated fluids in Surprise Valley follow a chemical divide that leads to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation. Plots of dissolved element ratios can be used to distinguish groundwater affected by evaporation from water affected by thermal water-rock interaction, however it is challenging to select components for plotting that best illustrate different fluid evolution mechanisms. Here, we use a principal component analysis of centered log-ratio transformed data, coupled with geochemical models of fluid evaporation and thermal mixing pathways, to identify components to plot that distinguish between groundwater samples influenced by evaporation from those influenced by thermal processes. We find that groundwater samples with a thermal signature come from wells that define a coherent, linear geographical distribution that closely matches the location of known and inferred faults. Modification of the general approach employed here provides promise for identifying blind geothermal resources in other locations, by applying low-cost geochemical modeling and statistical techniques to areas where large groundwater quality geochemical datasets are available.

Measurements were performed in three healthy and two die-back reed stands in the summer of 1997. In the leaves of declining reeds, the chlorophyll content was lower than in the vigorous sites. In the former sites, there was a significant rise in the total carotenoid pool (320-480 mmol mol(-1) chl (a + b)) as compared to that of the vigorous sites (250-350 mmol mol(-1) chl (a + b). The size of the xanthophyll cycle pool and the beta-carotene content of leaves significantly increased in the die-back sites. In early summer, the potential photochemical quantum efficiency of Photosystem 11 (Fv/Fm) did not differ considerably (0.79-0.81) from site to site, yet by August it significantly decreased (0.74-0.77) in the die-back sites as compared to the vigorous sites. The maximum CO2 assimilation rate measured on the 3rd and 4th leaves ranged from 11 to 17 CO(2)mumol m(-2) s(-1) and from 9 to 12 CO(2)mumol m(-2) s(-1) in the vigorous sites and the die-back sites, respectively. The stomatal conductance was also lower in the die-back sites (200-350 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)) than in the vigorous reed stands (380-510 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)) which might result in the functional impairment of the gas ventilation system of the declining reeds, and consequently in oxygen deficiency and damage to the rhizome.

Anomopoda avoided the surface layer during the day only in the pelagic zone. In the surface layer near the shore, however, they were very abundant. Because densities in the pelagic zone during the day were very low, and high during the night, the population undoubtedly moved from the littoral zone or from the sediments to the pelagic. Accumulation of zooplankton at the littoral site is either the result of random dispersal or wind-induced movements. Bythotrephes' diel distribution pattern is possibly related to that of their prey, the anomopods. Leptodora mostly exhibited a 'normal' diel vertical migration with a small amplitude. Wind most likely influenced the horizontal distribution of the zooplankton. Bythotrephes body length increased with higher temperatures, whereas spine length was constant throughout the year. Bythotrephes can already be fertile in the first developmental stage, indicating that a rapid adaptation to a favourable environment is possible. The number of parthenogenetically produced eggs per ovigerous female was higher at the start of the growing season and constant throughout the rest of the year. Relatively few resting eggs and males were found in autumn.																			0018-8158					JUL 7	1995	307	1-3					239	251		10.1007/BF00032018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032018													WOS:A1995RY51900030
J	GORHAM, E				GORHAM, E			CHEMICAL STUDIES ON THE SOILS AND VEGETATION OF WATERLOGGED HABITATS IN THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A study has been made of the nutrient status of some waterlogged soils and their plants in the English Lake District. In passing from rela- tively inorganic lake muds through semi-aquatic soils to raised bog peats, the amt. of soil acids increases, base saturation declines, and humus N also falls. The changes are most marked at the transition from semi-aquatic to raised bog peats. These changes are reflected in the plants, those from underwater sites being highest in minerals and N and those from raised bogs lowest in both these constituents.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1953	41	2					345	360		10.2307/2257046	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2257046													WOS:A1953YD68600011
J	Zhang, C; Lai, SY; Gao, XP; Xu, LP				Zhang, Chen; Lai, Shiyu; Gao, Xueping; Xu, Liping			Potential impacts of climate change on water quality in a shallow reservoir in China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												To study the potential effects of climate change on water quality in a shallow reservoir in China, the field data analysis method is applied to data collected over a given monitoring period. Nine water quality parameters (water temperature, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen) and three climate indicators for 20 years (1992-2011) are considered. The annual trends exhibit significant trends with respect to certain water quality and climate parameters. Five parameters exhibit significant seasonality differences in the monthly means between the two decades (1992-2001 and 2002-2011) of the monitoring period. Non-parametric regression of the statistical analyses is performed to explore potential key climate drivers of water quality in the reservoir. The results indicate that seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall may have positive impacts on water quality. However, an extremely cold spring and high wind speed are likely to affect the self-stabilising equilibrium states of the reservoir, which requires attention in the future. The results suggest that land use changes have important impact on nitrogen load. This study provides useful information regarding the potential effects of climate change on water quality in developing countries.

First occurrence of the invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum in eelgrass habitat	AQUATIC INVASIONS												During the late 20th century, several species of alien tunicates invaded New England marine coastal waters. In Autumn 2008, we surveyed for tunicates in Lake Tashmoo, a protected marine pond with shellfish aquaculture operations and restored bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians habitat on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. We found the invasive tunicates Ascidiella aspersa, Botrylloides violaceus, Botryllus schlosseri, Didemnum vexillum, Diplosoma listerianum, Styela clava and native tunicate Molgula manhattensis attached to artificial substrates throughout Lake Tashmoo and B. violaceus, B. schlosseri, D. vexillum, D. listerianum and M. manhattensis attached to eelgrass Zostera marina in the middle of Lake Tashmoo. Tunicates were growing on the stalk and blade of in situ eelgrass, floating pieces of eelgrass (a transport and dispersal mechanism), and pieces of eelgrass in fouling communities on boat hulls and aquaculture floats. Botrylloides violaceus, B. schlosseri, D. listerianum and M. manhattensis have been previously recorded as utilizing eelgrass as substrate, but this is the first recorded occurrence of D. vexillum to utilize eelgrass as substrate. Perhaps because of lack of substrate space in Lake Tashmoo, D. vexillum spread to eelgrass. Eelgrass serves as a juvenile shellfish and fish habitat and threats to it are of concern by coastal managers and the fishing industry.																			1798-6540					MAR	2010	5	1			SI		23	29		10.3391/ai.2010.5.1.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2010.5.1.4													WOS:000208389700004

IN-SITU MONITORING OF THE ANNUAL REDOX CYCLE	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Using a recently developed in situ multiprobe the redox development in the water column of warm-monomictic Lake Kinneret was investigated during three annual cycles. During the time when sulfide release into the meta- and hypolimnion is initiated, our measurements show a linear relationship, close to the thermodynamic function, between the platinum electrode potential and the amount of sulfide produced by the sulfate reducing bacteria. A change of this relationship during summer stratification coincides with the bloom of the phototrophic sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides.

J	Rosch, R; Schmid, W				Rosch, R; Schmid, W			Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus L), newly introduced into Lake Constance: Preliminary data on population biology and possible effects on whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L)	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI					2nd International Percid Fish Symposium (PERCID II)	AUG 21-25, 1995	VAASA, FINLAND	Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst				In 1987, ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus L.) was recorded for the first time in Lake Constance, Germany. Since then its population has increased dramatically. This species is now (1995) found in high numbers throughout the lake from inshore areas to depths up to 100 m. In autumn 1994, the ruffe population consisted of fish of an age of 0+ to 3+. Maximum body length was 16 cm. At the end of the first year ruffe attained an average body length of 7.6 +/- 0.9 cm (mean +/- S.D.), at the end of the second year 10.4 +/- 1.1 cm. During the growing season ruffe were bottom feeders, preying mainly on chironomids and detritus. However, during the spawning season of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) in December ruffe switched to whitefish eggs as a main prey. In December 1993, high numbers of eggs were found in the stomachs of all ruffe investigated with a maximum of 322 eggs in a ruffe of 16 cm body length and 60.1 g body wet weight. In December 1994, ruffe started predation on whitefish eggs at the end of the spawning period, but the percentage of ruffe preying on whitefish eggs did not exceed 60%. Due to this egg predation, negative impacts on the natural reproduction of nearshore spawning whitefish are to be expected. There is also a possibility of interactions during the growing season with the commercially important perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) population.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					467	471																WOS:A1996WB44500023
J	SVEDANG, MU				SVEDANG, MU			CARBON-DIOXIDE AS A FACTOR REGULATING THE GROWTH DYNAMICS OF JUNCUS-BULBOSUS	AQUATIC BOTANY												The unusual growth pattern exhibited by Juncus bulbosus L. in a slightly acidic Swedish brown-water lake is due to a CO2 deficit. Decrease in growth rate during the summer can be avoided through CO2 addition in July when CO2 availability is low and epiphytes are thriving. Growth of J. bulbosus in the laboratory is stimulated by CO2 addition up to a concentration somewhat higher than in air (500 ppm). while higher CO2 pressure restrains growth. Root growth reflects the leaf biomass development, but is favoured by elevated CO2 levels even more than the leaves.																			0304-3770					APR	1992	42	3					231	240																WOS:A1992HN85300003
J	Glasby, TM; Gibson, PT; Laird, R; Swadling, DS; West, G				Glasby, Tim M.; Gibson, Peter T.; Laird, Roger; Swadling, Daniel S.; West, Gregory			Black summer bushfires caused extensive damage to estuarine wetlands in New South Wales, Australia	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												There is now considerable evidence that, as the climate continues to warm, bushfires are becoming more common and severe, particularly in regions such as south-eastern Australia. The extraordinary Australian bushfires over the summer of 2019/2020 resulted in the burning of habitats such as highland peat swamps and intertidal estuarine wetlands over unprecedented spatial scales. Across New South Wales, these bushfires affected 183 ha of saltmarshes and 23 ha of mangroves in 19 estuaries. The percentage of fire-affected saltmarsh ranged from 51% to 81% in the worst impacted estuaries, although typically <= 15% of mapped saltmarsh was damaged. Just over 50% of mangroves were burnt in Wonboyn Lake (although this constituted <0.2 ha), whereas in all other estuaries, <= 5% of mangroves were burnt. At the state-wide scale, the likelihood of saltmarshes being affected by fire was unrelated to adjacent terrestrial vegetation; however, mangroves adjacent to burnt wet sclerophyll forest were more likely to burn than not. Burnt mangroves were almost exclusively associated with extreme or high severity fires in adjacent terrestrial vegetation, yet saltmarshes were also impacted in some cases by moderate or low-intensity fires. Many species of saltmarsh plants had re-sprouted or germinated after 6-24 months, but the extent of any recovery or changes in species composition were not quantified. The majority of fire-affected mangrove trees appeared to be dead 24 months after the fires, despite observations of epicormic growth on some trees after six months. Bushfire impacts to estuarine wetlands are likely to become more frequent and results from our work can help target hazard reduction burning that might be considered for minimising damage to mangroves. More work is required to better understand potential longer term impacts and the capacity for natural recovery of estuarine wetlands from bushfires.					; West, Gregory/ITU-5658-2023; Swadling, Daniel/GPP-2225-2022; Glasby, Tim/Q-3670-2016	West, Greg/0000-0002-7255-0736; Glasby, Tim/0000-0001-5011-7731; Swadling, Daniel/0000-0001-8186-7359													1442-7001	1442-8903				JAN	2023	24	1					27	35		10.1111/emr.12572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.12572		JAN 2023											WOS:000921592500001

Aquatic ecosystems in a newly formed ecospace: Early Pliocene lakes in the Central Andean Altiplano	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Uplift of the Altiplano in the Central Andes of South America had profound effects on land, oceans and atmosphere. Very little, however, is known about the ecosystems that developed on the ecospaces first formed once the Altiplano reached its present high altitude. We present a micropaleontological (diatoms and ostracods) and stratigraphic analysis of Pliocene Member C of the El Descanso Formation that outcrops near the town of Yauri, Lithofacies analysis indicates that fluvial conditions were eventually replaced by several lacustrine and marsh environments. Diatom and ostracod assemblages indicate that these bodies of water were alkaline, slightly saline and shallow. Lacustrine conditions were favoured by a change in the tectonic regime from compressional to tensional, which led to formation of small isolated basins, and by wet conditions. We hypothesize that a stronger and/or longer rainy season prevailed during that time in the Altiplano, possibly as a consequence of an intensified South American Summer Monsoon, driven by a warmer atmosphere, imposed by high concentrations of atmospheric CO2.					; Benito-Granell, Xavier/J-8032-2015; Tapia, Pedro M/GYR-1147-2022; Tapia, Pedro/GYR-1147-2022; Benito, Xavier/AAH-1225-2019; Escobar, Jaime/HSE-4459-2023	jaramillo, carlos/0000-0002-2616-5079; Benito-Granell, Xavier/0000-0003-0792-2625; Tapia, Pedro M/0000-0002-0708-4468; Salazar-Rios, Andres Felipe/0000-0001-7832-4732; Kar, Nandini/0000-0001-5084-0292													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 15	2018	490						218	226		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.001													WOS:000423637900015
