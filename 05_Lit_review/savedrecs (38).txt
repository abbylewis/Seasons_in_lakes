J	Kusimba, SB				Kusimba, SB			Hunter-gatherer land use patterns in Later Stone Age East Africa	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												This paper discusses land use patterns of hunter-gatherers inhabiting arid grasslands of later Pleistocene East Africa, inferred from an analysis of raw material economy in five Later Stone Age (LSA) lithic assemblages from Lukenya Hill, southern Kenya. Later Stone Age lithic assemblages at Lukenya fall into two groups, one based predominantly on the use of quartz to manufacture scrapers and other flake tools, and the second using greater amounts of rarer chert and obsidian lithic materials to manufacture microliths. Aspects of raw material use, coupled with ethnographic data on how food and water abundance affects Kalahari forager land use, indicate that the first group of sites had longer occupations by groups with smaller home ranges. The second group of sites had shorter occupations by more mobile groups with larger home ranges. The paper compares the land use patterns of arid grassland LSA foragers, like those at Lukenya Hill, with those in woodland and forest areas of Central and Southeastern Africa. Improvements in the ability to procure food, such as the development of fishing and fowling technologies or better hunting projectiles, allowed grassland groups to become more mobile in the later LSA, while foragers in wetter parts of Africa, including woodlands, riverine areas, and lakeshores, seem to have intensified the procurement of fish and plant foods. The processes of economic specialization taking place in both grassland and woodland areas of Later Stone Age Africa may have parallels in other parts of the Old World. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Glaciers and meltwater flux to Lake Baikal during the Last Glacial Maximum	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Conference on ACEP Research Forum Scientific Assembly	OCT, 2009	Boston, MA					Maximal 3D ice extent during MIS 2 around Lake Baikal has been reconstructed using glacial landforms in the field, aerial photos, satellite images, and CIS analysis. This regional glacial maximum is correlated (similar to 18 lcyr BP) with the global LGM based on available (14)C dates, cosmogenic (10)Be exposure ages, correlation of lakeshore moraines with two raised shorelines, and the IRD record in lake sediments. Total ice area was similar to 13,000 km(2) and ice volume similar to 2000 km(3) (similar to 1800 km(3) in water equivalent). Ice distribution was controlled by topography and ice fields, with valley glaciers spreading to adjacent depressions. Locally, ice caps with outlet glaciers existed. Averaged regional ELA is estimated to be 1290 +/- 240 m with the EIA depression at approximately 1340 m. More acceptable regional scenario of the LGM precipitation (reduction by 25-50%) implies that summer temperature decreased (by similar to 6-12 degrees C) along with an increased solid fraction in precipitation (up to 85%). There were primary climatic controls for glaciation. Meltwater supply, as a strong controller of LGM water budget (60% of total water input to the lake), is estimated to have been from 6.4 to 9.0 km(3) yr(-1) (7-9 times less than present-day river input). Preliminary balance estimation shows that during full glacial stage Lake Baikal was overflowing, with the Angara River output as [4-9] km(3) yr(-1) and with lake level close to that today. Lake level drop down to the depth of -40 m is recorded by geological and geophysical evidence, perhaps explaining the abrupt increase in effective evaporation in the lake watershed at the start of MIS 2 (similar to 24-18 ky BP).

USING 2D AND 3D OIL SPILL TRAJECTORY AND FATE MODELS TO ASSESS THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL CRUDE OIL RELEASES ALONG THE ENBRIDGE LINE 3 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM PIPELINE	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CONFERENCE, 2018, VOL 2	Proceedings of the International Pipeline Conference				12th International Pipeline Conference (IPC 2018)	SEP 24-28, 2018	Calgary, CANADA	ASME, Inst IPTI				The proposed Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Program would replace the aging pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, Canada to Superior, Wisconsin, USA. For the Canadian route, an Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment (EHHRA) was prepared for the National Energy Board (NEB) in Canada. In the United States, an Assessment of Accidental Releases (AAR) and the Supplemental Release Report were part of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce, Energy Environmental Review and Analysis (DOC-EERA). Computational oil spill modeling was used to assess the predicted trajectory (movement), fate (behavior and weathering), and potential effects (impacts) associated with accidental releases of crude oil along the proposed pipeline. This modeling included the 2-dimensional OILMAPLand and 3-dimensional SIMAP models. A total of 64 hypothetical release scenarios were investigated to understand the range of potential trajectories, fates, and effects that may be possible from multiple product types (Bakken, Federated Crude, and Cold Lake Winter Blend), released at any location, under varying environmental conditions. Trajectory and fate modeling was used to predict the downstream movement and timing of oil, as well as the expected surface oil thickness, water column contamination, shoreline and sediment oiling, and proportion evaporated to the atmosphere. These results were then used to assess the potential environmental effects to demonstrate the variability of outcomes following a release under different release conditions.																			1537-6788		978-0-7918-5187-6				2018									V002T02A002															WOS:000461127600019

The newly developed thermoelectric-power-generating material does not require an external high-temperature heat source due to the ability of paper to absorb liquid through capillary action and heat of vaporization generated when the liquid evaporates. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of realizing the transpiration-type thermoelectric-power-generating paper. To begin with, the type of paper used as raw material for the composite paper was examined, and the fabrication process was modified in order to obtain more efficient liquid absorption based on capillary action. Then, the absorbing ability of the liquid was evaluated. Next, the feasibility of thermoelectric power generation using the heat of vaporization was confirmed. Moreover, for more efficient thermoelectric conversion, multisheet structures were also studied. Through several experiments, the material's feasibility was verified, and it was confirmed that more power can be easily obtained through the use of multiple sheets. Specifically, a single sample spontaneously generated a temperature difference of up to 1.7 degrees C due to the heat of vaporization, generating an electromotive force of 36 mu V. From the sample with a five-sheet structure, an electromotive force of 356 mu V was obtained at a temperature difference of 2 degrees C. This material can be used in watery environments, such as rivers, lakes, and hot springs, and is expected to become a new energy-harvesting device.

The storm-generated shell deposits at Latinos Spit on the Brazilian shore are dominated by the estuarine bivalve Erodona mactroides, represented mostly by juveniles, and the gastropod Heleobia australis. Species previously unrecorded in this site include the marine gastropods Cylichnella bidentata, Buccinanops cochlidium and Pachycymbiola brasiliana, and the bivalves Tagelus plebeius, Ostrea puelchana, Crassostrea cf. praia, Mactra isabelleana, Anomalocardia flexuosa and Cyrtopleura costata. The two latter currently inhabit tropical areas to the north of Rio Grande do Sul, and their presence in Mirim Lake indicates average coastal water temperatures about 2-3 degrees C warmer than today. This condition promoted the precipitation of calcium carbonate from dissolved shells, thus cementing together sand and shells in the form of coquinas. The stratigraphic succession, OSL ages obtained in quartz sand from one coquina, radiocarbon dated shells, and delta C-13 and delta O-18 of five E. mactroides and five marine species indicate that Mirim Lake became a brackish lagoon around 7.6 ka ago, in response to the postglacial marine transgression (PMT), followed by fully marine conditions during the sea-level highstand of 6-5 ka BP. Marine influence was reduced after similar to 4 ka BP as the result of sea-level fall and the closure of the connection with the ocean, related to the evolution of the sandy barrier that originated the modern shoreline. The environmental changes recorded in Mirim Lake help understand how coastal lagoons and their associated ecosystems respond to sea-level oscillations, which may be relevant to address future responses of these water bodies to the ongoing climate change.

How to sample juvenile Lake Sturgeon, (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817), in Boreal Shield rivers using gill nets, with an emphasis on assessing recruitment patterns	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				Adaptive management and recovery initiatives for long-lived, late-maturing species such as Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, are complicated by temporal lags. By the time anthropogenic impacts on critical periods (spawning, larval hatch, age-0 survival) would be manifested in adult populations, decades might have passed. However, recruitment patterns and population trajectory responses (both positive and negative) can be identified by examining the juvenile life stage. This study describes and evaluates a gill net method for sampling juvenile Lake Sturgeon between 250 and 800mm fork length (FL) resident in Boreal Shield rivers in relative proportion to their abundance. The method is based on previous observations of deepwater preference (>10-15m), and employs mesh sizes of 25.4, 50.8, 76.2, 127.0 and 152.4mm stretched measure. Selectivity curves were generated based on 1040 Lake Sturgeon captures from six reaches of the Winnipeg and Nelson rivers, Canada. A normal (common spread) curve approximated a normal distribution centered on similar to 390mm FL, and relative selection exceeded 0.65 across the 250-800mm FL range. For the Slave Falls Reservoir (Winnipeg River), Spearman's rank-order correlation () for zone-specific cohort-frequency distributions in adjacent sampling years ranged from 0.85 to 0.93, while the score for the entire reservoir was 0.95, suggesting inter-annual consistency. The method allows for rapid and robust assessments of relative abundance and cohort strength for juvenile Lake Sturgeon within large Boreal Shield river systems, and facilitates biological comparisons among reaches and over time. Incidentally, cohort frequency results derived herein indicate that juvenile recruitment in regulated Boreal Shield rivers can be erratic, irrespective of size of the spawning stock. Such a pattern could be an inherent characteristic of the species that needs to be accounted for when developing adaptive management and species recovery plans.

J	Sahin, I				Sahin, Ilhan			From Serve Palace to Seyf Palace to Seyfe	OSMANLI ARASTIRMALARI-THE JOURNAL OF OTTOMAN STUDIES												Today, Lake Seyfe, located within the border of the Mucur district in the northeast of K & imath;r & scedil;ehir province, and the Seyfe village, located by this lake, are 16 km away from Mucur. The lake, which is known as the "bird paradise", is a place where many bird species that migrate from other lands and countries stay and breed, according to the seasons and their lifecycles throughout the year. However, due to climate change in recent years, global warming, the evaporation of the water sources feeding the lake and high levels of evaporation, the lake has largely lost this population feature, especially in the summer months. It has been determined that the oldest known name of the lake is Serve or Serve Saray, , meaning the nest and place of birds. This name was probably given during the Anatolian Seljuk period before 1480, when K & imath;r & scedil;ehir and the region came under Ottoman rule. The arable land near the lake and the village that was later established are also mentioned as Serve or Serve Saray in the Ottoman archives. In 1557, the tax revenues of the arable land and the village, known as divani , were under the joint possession of the timar holders Seyfi and his brother Haydar. Later, it is seen that the village began to appear in the archival records under the name Seyf Saray, in reference to Seyfi's name. The fact that the village, and therefore the lake, began to be known as Seyf Saray indicates that Seyfi played an important role in the formation and preservation of the village, and that his services may have been mentioned by word of mouth among the people of the village and the surrounding area. In this context, it should be noted that the name of the village and the lake began to be called Seyf Saray, and over time, as Saray was forgotten, only the name Seyfe remained permanent.																			0255-0636						2024		63					37	48																WOS:001320353300002

However, there was a spatially inconsistent hydroclimatic response to the 4.2 ka event in the Asian monsoon region. To further characterize and to determine the origin of this phenomenon, we present a pollen record spanning the interval from 10.7 ka to the present from a subalpine lake in the Hengduan Mountains, southwestern China, which are climatically influenced by the Indian monsoon; and we then reconstruct the spatial pattern of the hydroclimatic response to the 4.2 ka event across the Asian monsoon region, based on a synthesis of our own and previously published data. The results reveal the following. (i) During the interval of 4.5-3.9 ka (spanning the 4.2 ka event) in the subtropical mountains there were abrupt decreases in evergreen broadleaved trees, including evergreen Quercus, Castanopsis and Cyclo-balanopsis. (ii) The hydroclimatic response to the 4.2 ka event across the Asian monsoon region was characterized by a tripolar precipitation pattern, with decreased rainfall over India and southwestern and northern China, and increased rainfall over central China. Therefore, we conclude that the hydroclimatic response to the 4.2 ka event in the Asian monsoon region was spatially heterogenous, which we argue was related to the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). During the interval of 4.5-3.9 ka, cooling at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, caused by AMOC weak-ening, led to the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which resulted in decreased rainfall over most of the Asian monsoon region. The wet conditions in central China may have been modulated by the southward movement of the westerlies, which was also caused by the cooling at northern high latitudes. The southward displacement of the westerlies restricted the northward pene-tration of the monsoonal air flow, and thus the monsoon rainbelt stagnated over central China, where there was a corresponding increase in precipitation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jiang, LG; Wu, S; Liu, Y				Jiang, Luguang; Wu, Si; Liu, Ye			Change Analysis on the Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Main Crop Planting in the Middle Yangtze Plain	REMOTE SENSING												As a traditional agricultural production base in China, the Middle Yangtze Plain (MYP) is a typical region to explore the intensification, large-scale, and agglomeration of agricultural land, and its crop planting situation is sensitive to changes in national agricultural policy and economic development. So far, the research of crop remote sensing extraction mainly has focused on the areas with simple crops rotation patterns, by using short-time sequence remote sensing data with low spatial resolution. The objective of this study was to address how to accurately map the spatial distribution of main crops considering their spectral and phenological features, and what characteristics of spatio-temporal patterns dynamics of crops occurred in the MYP in 1990-2020. Based on Landsat and MODIS data, using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) as well as the raster-based spectral and phenological differential change method (RSPDCM), this study mapped the spatial distribution of main crops (rice, cotton, maize, soybean, rapeseed and winter wheat) in the MYP during 1990-2020 and analyzed their planting characteristics. The RSPDCM has a good overall accuracy of more than 89%. The planting characteristics of the main crops were highly intensive and agglomerate double-cropping rotation in the MYP's paddy field. Rice and rapeseed were the two most important crops, accounting for 74.75% of the annual planting area. The highly intensive and large-scale areas were mainly distributed in the Dongting Lake Plain (DTLP) and Poyang Lake Plain (PYLP), while the highly agglomerate areas of main crops were mainly distributed in the Jianghan Plain (JHP). This study innovatively provides a high-precision multi-cropping spatial dynamic mapping method and basic information, which is helpful to realize high-precision remote sensing extraction of crops in different regions of the world and provide basic data for optimizing the allocation of agricultural production resources in top grain-producing areas.					; Jiang, Luguang/KIE-5429-2024	Jiang, Luguang/0000-0001-5948-7667; Liu, Ye/0000-0002-0377-8956; Wu, Si/0000-0002-2676-9884														2072-4292				MAR	2022	14	5							1141	10.3390/rs14051141	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14051141													WOS:000768001300001

The new isolates grow at pH values between 7.0 and 11.0, with pH optima for growth between 9.0 and 10.0. Growth occurs at total salts concentration between 0% and 20% (w/v) with optimum at 0%-7% (w/v). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA sequence comparison indicate that these isolates are related (>96% similarity) to members of the Halomonadaceae within the gamma-3 subdivision of the Proteobacteria. These analyses indicate that existing species within the Halomonadaceae fell within three main groups, one group comprising the type species of Halomonas, Halomonas elongata, and a number of other known species including one soda lake isolate. A second group constituting most of the remaining known species of Halomonas and related Chromohalobacter spp. includes 3 soda lake isolates with high DNA-DNA homologies. The third group included Halomonas halodenitrificans, Halomonas desiderata, Halomonas cupida, and 13 soda lake isolates. Phenotypic comparisons indicated that the majority of soda lake strains shared similar morphological, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic properties to known strains of Halomonas but grew under alkaline conditions. The 3 soda lake isolates with high DNA-DNA homologies were, however, significantly different in antibiotic sensitivity pat tern and in the utilization of several substrates, were unable to reduce nitrite, and showed low DNA-DNA homologies with known halomonads in the same group. We propose that these isolates comprise a new species of the genus Halomonas that we name Halomonas magadii sp. nov. The type strain is strain 21 MI (NCIMB 13595).					; Jones, Brian/J-4522-2013; Ventosa, Antonio/K-8239-2017; Márquez, M./K-8155-2014	Ventosa, Antonio/0000-0002-7573-0556; Jones, Brian/0000-0002-3403-0836; 													1431-0651					FEB	2000	4	1					53	60											10741837					WOS:000086761600007

Fish Assemblage Responses to the Exclusion of Invasive Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) from a Large Freshwater Coastal Wetland, Delta Marsh, Manitoba	WETLANDS												Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an invasive fish species in North America and around the world. Through their feeding and spawning they contribute to the deterioration of wetland habitats. Exclusion structures are a frequently used management option for limiting their negative impacts. While habitat responses to common carp exclusion have been reported, little is known about impacts of exclusion structure operation on native fish assemblages. Here we describe a common carp exclusion project on a large freshwater coastal wetland, Delta Marsh, in south-central Manitoba, Canada. Most fish species, including common carp, overwinter in Lake Manitoba and migrate each spring to feed and spawn in the marsh. Exclusion structures with removeable screens were installed on connecting channels between the lake and marsh and were deemed the best management option to exclude common carp from the marsh. In this paper we contrast relative abundance and mean size of large-bodied fish species between pre- (three years) and post- (six years) exclusion periods, as well as inside and outside the common carp exclusion zone. In addition, we monitored fish migration into the marsh to evaluate initial management recommendations. Using a combination of delayed exclusion screen placement and 70 mm screen openings, we were able to reduce the number of large common carp present in the marsh with minimal impacts on the native fish assemblage. We also provide suggested changes to the timing of screen placement to increase common carp exclusion.

S	Mitchell, NC		Micallef, A; Krastel, S; Savini, A		Mitchell, Neil C.			Mid-ocean Ridges	SUBMARINE GEOMORPHOLOGY	Springer Geology											Mid-ocean ridges illustrate well how volcanic, tectonic, hydrothermal and sedimentary processes sculpt geomorphology in the deep ocean. Because of their poor accessibility (lying 2700 m below sea level on average) and remote locations, the development and deployment of new technology has been important for the discovery and investigation of new features. In contrast with continental environments, erosion has only modestly affected these areas, so features can be well preserved, in particular, volcanic landforms. The eruption of lavas creates volcanic cones, ridges of hummocky flows, widespread low-relief flows and drain-back features in lava lakes. Plate-tectonic extension creates faults, many with moderate dips, as inferred from the earthquakes they produce. However, other faults with presently shallower dips are suggested by corrugated slip surfaces exposed at the seabed on slow-spreading ridges. Steep scarps, comprising fractured rock and in places weak lithologies such as serpentinite, are easily destabilized, producing landslides, talus cones and talus ramps. Seawaters penetrating the crust and heated by it produce hydrothermal springs, such as spectacular "black smokers". Precipitation of sulphides from those exhaling fluids and their deposition produces smooth mats of sediment and chimneys that can collapse to contribute to the sedimentary deposits as talus. This combination of processes makes mid-ocean ridges fascinating environments to work on, representing how >60% of Earth's solid (oceanic) crust has been created. Despite poor accessibility of such areas, researchers will likely continue to deploy new instruments as they are developed to reveal more details of mid-ocean ridge geomorphology and understanding of how it develops.					; Mitchell, Neil/B-9807-2008	Mitchell, Neil/0000-0002-6483-2450; 													2197-9545		978-3-319-57852-1; 978-3-319-57851-4				2018							349	365		10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_18	10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1												WOS:000429825400019

A Zr/TiO2-Nb/Y immobile element ratio plot indicates that the vitric tuffs, like the ignimbrite, are of rhyolitic composition. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies indicate that the mordenite and clinoptilolite are accompanied by authigenic K-feldspar and Opal-CT. The zeolites and other authigenie minerals are very fine grained (<10 mum), with open meshes of acicular mordenite crystals that result in low densities (0.7-1.0 g cm(-3)) in mordenite-rich tuffs. From Pearce element ratio analysis of whole-rock chemical analyses, only Na and K appear to have been mobilized during alteration. The zeolite deposits are associated with sinter, hydrothermal eruption breccias and silicified fault breccias that represent surface or near-surface manifestations of geothermal activity. Plant material extracted from a sinter overlying one of the deposits has a C-14 age of 8498+/-60 BP, which is interpreted to be the age of zeolite deposition for this deposit. Mordenite and clinoptilolite occur in the lower-T (60-110degreesC) parts of some active or recently active geothermal systems elsewhere in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The main fluid in these systems is weakly saline (alkali-chloride) water heated by geothermal activity. The Ngakuru zeolite deposits are interpreted as the products of the reaction of vitric tuffs with this type of water in the near-surface part of recently active geothermal systems.

Density and distribution of epiphytic invertebrates on emergent macrophytes in a floodplain billabong	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The abundance of epiphytic invertebrates living on both submerged and emergent macrophytes in lentic systems is influenced by a range of environmental features at both spatial and temporal scales. Such features include water chemistry, habitat complexity, hydrology and external influences such as climatic cycles. Dugays 2 billabong is a floodplain lake on the highly regulated, mid-upper Murray River in southeastern Australia. Giant rush (Juncus ingens N.A. Wakefield) is the dominant habitat feature in this billabong. This plant is a simple, single-stemmed, densely packed emergent macrophyte that fringes the littoral margins. The macrophyte habitat available to epiphytic invertebrates in this billabong is highly variable through time largely due to the variable water levels imposed by the regulated river channel for downstream irrigation needs, particularly through summer. To investigate both spatial and temporal patterns in the epiphytic invertebrates of Dugays 2 billabong, invertebrates were sampled within giant rush stands on five occasions over one year. Spatial variability in epifaunal density was generally low, while temporal densities were highly variable through time. Spatial patterns of invertebrate abundance revealed few associations with habitat structure or water quality, apart from those associated with water depth, particularly when sampling had been preceded by fluctuating water levels. High temporal variability in assemblage structure of the epifauna reflects the high background environmental variation that occurs in this system.

Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of information regarding the contamination levels of MPs in aquaculture ponds worldwide. In this study, sediment and water samples were collected from five types of fish ponds, namely, homestead ponds (S1), commercial aquaculture ponds (S2), ponds near a residential area (S3), ponds near a small-scale industrial area (S4), and ponds near a large-scale industrial area (S5), to identify, characterize, and assess the contamination risk of MPs. Stereomicroscopic and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses revealed that the MPs ranged from 3.33 item/kg to 136.67 item/kg in sediment and 16.6 item/L to 100 item/L in water samples. Overall, the abundance of MPs was extremely high in S5, followed by S4, S2, S3, and S1, which clearly showed the levels increased with the intensity of human activities. The levels of MPs in both sediment and water showed significant differences (p < 0.05) within and between ponds, as well as in comparison between water and sediment samples. The concentrations of MPs surpassed those noted in aquaculture ponds of different nations. The majority of MPs consisted of fragments and films in both sediment and water samples. Furthermore, transparent and white-colored MPs were the prevailing types found in the sediment and water samples of the aquaculture ponds. Around 34% of MPs present in sediment and 30% in water fell within the size range of 0.5-1 mm. Polymers like polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were prevalent in both sediment and water samples. The contamination factor reached exceptionally elevated levels (>30 for sediment and >3 for water), signifying that the sampled regions, particularly S4 and S5 (industrial sites), displayed significant MP contamination. Moreover, the pollution load index values of the sediment (3.0 +/- 1.5) and water samples (1.5 +/- 0.3) also indicated the areas were contaminated with MPs. Multivariate analysis indicated that the elevated concentration of MPs in the studied region could be attributed to the discharge of effluents and other human-induced activities.

Transport and distribution of trace elements and other selected inorganic constituents by suspended particulates in the Salton Sea Basin, California, 2001	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Salton Sea Centennial Symposium/Symposium on Century of Symbiosis among Agriculture, Wildlife and People	MAR, 2005	San Diego, CA					In order to examine the transport of contaminants associated with river-derived suspended particles in the Salton Sea, California, large volume water samples were collected in transects established along the three major rivers emptying into the Salton Sea in fall 2001. Rivers in this area carry significant aqueous and particulate contaminant loads derived from irrigation water associated with the extensive agricultural activity, as well as wastewater from small and large municipalities. A variety of inorganic constituents, including trace metals, nutrients, and organic carbon were analyzed on suspended material isolated from water samples collected at upriver, near-shore, and off-shore sites established on the Alamo, New, and Whitewater rivers. Concentration patterns showed expected trends, with river-borne metals becoming diluted by organic-rich algal particles of lacustrine origin in off-shore stations. More soluble metals, such as cadmium, copper, and zinc showed a more even distribution between sites in the rivers and off-shore in the lake basin. General distributional trends of trace elements between particulate and aqueous forms were discerned by combining metal concentration data for particulates from this study with historical aqueous metals data. Highly insoluble trace metals, such as iron and aluminum, occurred almost entirely in the particulate phase, while major cations and approximately 95% of selenium were transported in the soluble phase. Evidence for greater reducing conditions in the New compared to the Alamo River was provided by the greater proportion of reduced (soluble) manganese in the New River. Evidence of bioconcentration of selenium and arsenic within the lake by algae was provided by calculating "enrichment" concentration ratios from metal concentrations on the algal-derived particulate samples and the off-shore sites.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2008	604						123	135		10.1007/s10750-008-9319-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9319-y													WOS:000254089000011

Conventionally, it is assumed that macroscopic charcoal particles are not transported far from fires (c. 200 m). Therefore macroscopic charcoal records are used to reconstruct local fire frequencies. However, the general scarcity of empirical and experimental evidence impedes a thorough check of this assumption. In this study we present the first unambiguous evidence of kilometre-scaled macroscopic charcoal transport in Europe. During the hot summer of 2003 an intensive crown Fire occurred in Leuk, central Swiss Alps, It affected 300 ha of forest as well as 10 ha of pasture and fallow land. Litter traps and nets had been located approximately 5 km west and cast of the burned area. The downwind site in the east (Jeizinen) recorded a strong charcoal fallout at 5.3 km from the fire edge. The observed charcoal influx of fragments with a size up to 1.3 cm reached average values of 0.144 and 0.098 mm(2)/cm(2) per fire (or yr) in five traps and two nets, respectively. These values are comparable with charcoal accumulations measured at only e. 50 m from large fires, suggesting that macroscopic charcoal transport does not decay rapidly to zero with increasing distance from the fire. We suggest a long-distance dispersal model for transport of macroscopic charcoal during large fire events. Reconstructions of local fire regimes may be affected by long-distance transport of macroscopic charcoal, although this problem is mitigated by the tendency of most macroscopic charcoal particles to be deposited within very short distances (< 50 m) from the fire edge.

J	Bandeen, J; Leatherland, JF				Bandeen, J; Leatherland, JF			Changes in the proximate composition of juvenile white suckers following re-feeding after a prolonged fast	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Cultured juvenile white suckers, Catostomus commersoni, are commonly held over winter without the provision of exogenous feed. This study examined the ability of suckers to recover from prolonged fasting, and the energy partitioning strategies employed during the re-feeding phase. In one trial, white suckers held, without exogenous feed, in commercial lake cages for a prolonged period were fed a semi-moist salmonid diet. Although the fish consumed the feed, they exhibited negligible growth over the 12 weeks of the trial, and there was no evidence of increases in tissue lipid, glycogen or protein. In the second trial, previously well-fed juvenile white suckers were starved for 20 weeks and then re-fed. Condition factor (K), but not body weight was increased during the 8 week trial. However, hepatosomatic index (HSI), hepatic and somatic glycogen, and somatic lipid and protein reserves (expressed as a percentage of tissue) were significantly increased during the re-feeding period. Further, changes in plasma thyroid hormone levels indicated an important role of these hormones in the energy partitioning events. The poor growth of juvenile white suckers in intensive culture may be caused by deleterious changes in feed conversion ability resulting from extended fasting of the fish prior to 'grow-out'.																			0967-6120	1573-143X				JUL	1997	5	4					327	337		10.1023/A:1018312123344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018312123344													WOS:A1997XK86800004

Seven plants were infected with WMV-1 only, 21 were infected with WMV-2 only, 8 were infected with both WMV-1 and WMV-2, and 3 were infected with a virus serologically related to WMV-2 but distinct from it. None of the samples was infected with WMV-M, SqMV or CMV. One of the WMV-2-related isolates (1119) was mechanically transmitted to zucchini squash in the greenhouse, where it caused systemic mosaic, distortion, veinbanding and blistering of leaves. This isolate also induced systemic infections of cucumber, watermelon, cantaloup, and Luffa acutangula and local infections of Chenopodium amaranticolor, c. quinoa, Phaseolus vulgaris and Pisum sativum ''Alaska''. The virus was transmitted in a styletborne manner by Myzus persicae. Striated inclusions and filamentous particles (.apprx. 760 nm long) were found in negatively stained leaf extracts. Isolate 1119 was found to be closely related serologically to zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) from Italy in SDS-immunodiffusion tests. Virus isolates serologically and symptomatologically similar to ZYMV were found in 6 counties representing the northern, central and southern portions of Florida in 1982.																			0191-2917	1943-7692					1984	68	3					230	233		10.1094/PD-69-230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-69-230													WOS:A1984SF51900018

Development of a real-time PCR for detection of the oyster pathogen Nocardia crassostreae based on its homogeneous 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY												Nocardia crassostreae, the causative agent of Pacific oyster nocardiosis (PON), is a Gram-positive actinomycete bacterium associated with Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) mortalities. Oysters infected with this bacterium have been reported previously from the west coast of North America and Japan. More recently, N. crassostreae was reported in oyster culture areas in the Netherlands. In this study, a sensitive real-time PCR for specific detection of N. crassostreae was developed, and the intra-species divergence of N. crassostreae from different geographical locations was studied. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) region of N. crassostreae was sequenced for a number of infected oysters originating from the Netherlands, Japan and Canada. The sequence analyses showed an absence of genetic variation in the ITS region between N. crassostreae from different geographical locations. Based on these ITS sequences a species-specific and highly sensitive SYBR Green real-time PCR assay was developed to facilitate detection of N. crassostreae in oyster tissue. To evaluate this new detection tool for N. crassostreae a preliminary validation was carried out and real-time PCR results were compared with other detection methods (histology, conventional PCR and bacterial isolation) using field samples from Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands. The genetic homogeneity in the ITS region between N. crassostreae from different geographical locations might be explained by the recent spread of the organism via the international trade in Pacific oysters for aquaculture purposes. However, the lack of genetic variation could also suggest that N. crassostreae is a genetically monomorphic species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Bai, XZ; Wang, J				Bai, Xuezhi; Wang, Jia			Atmospheric teleconnection patterns associated with severe and mild ice cover on the Great Lakes, 1963-2011	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												Atmospheric teleconnection circulation patterns associated with severe and mild ice cover over the Great Lakes are investigated using the composite analysis of lake ice data and National Center of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data for the period 1963-2011. The teleconnection pattern associated with the severe ice cover is the combination of a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or Arctic Oscillation (AO) and negative phase of Pacific/North America (PNA) pattern, while the pattern associated with the mild ice cover is the combination of a positive PNA (or an El Nino) and a positive phase of the NAO/AO. These two extreme ice conditions are associated with the North American ridge-trough variations. The intensified ridge-trough system produces a strong northwest-to-southeast tilted ridge and trough and increases the anomalous northwesterly wind, advecting cold, dry Arctic air to the Great Lakes. The weakened ridge-trough system produces a flattened ridge and trough, and promotes a climatological westerly wind, advecting warm, dry air from western North America to the Great Lakes. Although ice cover for all the individual lakes responds roughly linearly and symmetrically to both phases of the NAO/AO, and roughly nonlinearly and asymmetrically to El Nino and La Nina events, the overall ice cover response to individual NAO/AO or Nino3.4 index is not statistically significant. The combined NAO/AO and Nino3.4 indices can be used to reliably project severe ice cover during the simultaneous -NAO/AO and La Nina events, and mild ice cover during the simultaneous +NAO/AO and El Nino events.

At the beginning of the record, corresponding to the last part of the "Medieval Climate Anomaly" (MCA) (here the period between ca 1032 and 1262 AD), the chironomid-inferred mean July air temperatures were 1 degrees C warmer (p < 0.01) than the climate reference period (1961-1990). The "Little Ice Age" seems to have been separated into three phases: significantly colder (-1.1 degrees C in average, p <0.001) temperatures were inferred between ca 1262 and 1481 AD, between ca 1514 and 1718 AD (-1.2 degrees C in average, p <0.001) and between ca 1734 and 1782 AD (-0.6 degrees C in average, p < 0.1). Although the average temperature changes inferred by chironomids were within the error of prediction (1.5 degrees C) of the chironomid-temperature inference model used for reconstruction, the pattern of temperature changes corresponds well with records of the past millennium in Switzerland, in Europe and in the Northern Hemisphere. The average inferred July temperatures between ca 1900 and 2001 AD were significantly warmer (p < 0.05) than the climate reference period (1961-1990) by 1 degrees C which is in agreement with the instrumental data. The inferred July temperatures were in the same range as the inferred temperatures during the last part of the MCA suggesting that during the 20th century, at Lake Silvaplana, the chironomid-inferred temperatures do not exceed the natural climate variability of the past millennium.

A Younger Dryas-aged peat is also examined to provide better understanding of the regional climatic history. Samples of surficial lake sediments from Wrangel Island and Chukotka aid in interpreting the lacustrine records. The modern spectra differentiate the herb-dominated tundra of Wrangel Island from the shrub tundras of the mainland and are unique when compared to other arctic assemblages. Analysis of the fossil data indicates that a herb-dominated tundra has been present on southern and central Wrangel Island since at least 11 ka BP. Comparison to modern palynological data implies little change in vegetation during the Holocene. The lacustrine interpretations contrast to those based on paleobotanical study of peats and alluvium, which suggest modern vegetation was not present until ca 4-3 ka BP. Pre-Holocene assemblages have high percentages of Cyperaceae pollen, perhaps indicating more moderate conditions. Summer climate is inferred to be warmer and moister than present during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. The pattern of postglacial warming on Wrangel Island is more like that from eastern Beringia than from other areas of western Beringia. Modern synoptic anomaly maps indicate that such a climatic pattern is reasonable and related to the presence of negative anomalies over western Beringia and a region of weaker positive 500 mb pressure centered over the Beaufort Sea.

However, current research over establishing a low fertilizer input paddy-based cropping system with comprehensive management for reducing runoff losses of N and P is insufficient. A five-year field trial was carried out with a rice-fava planting system in the Erhai Lake watershed from 2015 to 2019. Three treatments were designed namely chemical fertilizer plus manure (CMF), reduced chemical fertilizer combined with manure at the same application rate under CMF treatment (RF), and returning straw plus chemical and organic fertilizers at the same rate with RF treatment (RFS). The mean annual runoff losses of total N (TN) and total P (TP) range from 0.99 to 1.39 kg ha-1 yr- 1 and 0.09-0.12 kg ha-1 yr- 1. Compared with CMF treatment, RF had lower runoff losses of TN and TP by 20.86% and 23.05%, respectively, but the yields and soil fertility were also reduced. After returning straw, soil organic carbon (SOC), TN, and crop yields were maintained or even increased, and runoff losses of TN and TP were further reduced by 9.48% and 7.41%, respectively, compared with RF. Therefore, the runoff losses of N and P decreased by selecting the rice-fava rotation system and reducing chemical fertilizer input through manure application and straw returning, which greatly reduced the surplus N and P in this system. Moreover, the temporal variation in the concentration of TN and TP, along with the N:P ratio approved the existence of potential risk caused by TN and TP losses to the watershed in the early stage of rice growth. Overall, in addition to taking field measures to reduce the N and P runoff losses from paddy fields, the runoff water with high N and P concentrations in early rice growth stage cannot be ignored.

To determine the effects of predation and nutrient enrichment on the pelagic microbial food web of an ultra-oligotrophic lake, we added copepods and cladocerans at low biomasses (<60 mu g l(-1)) to in situ enclosures in Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand, in the presence and absence of added nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). In response to nutrient fertilization, the concentrations of phototrophs >3 mu m and heterotrophic bacteria increased by 50 and 15%, respectively, over 4 days, but those of cyanobacterial picoplankton decreased by 68%. The presence of calanoid copepods (Boeckella dilarata) at ambient densities (1 and 4 l(-1)) rapidly and severely suppressed ciliate population growth over 4 days and also lowered that of flagellates >3 mu m, even when microbial growth was enhanced by added nutrients. The presence of a small cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia, at double the densities, but similar biomasses, to those of copepods, depressed the net growth rates of ciliates and flagellates to a lesser degree. The net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria after 4 days declined with flagellate abundance, consistent with the possibility of regulation by flagellates. Although bacteria and algae increased in response to nutrient fertilization (bottom-up control), predation (top-down control) appeared to play an important role in structuring the microbial food web of this ultra-oligotrophic lake in summer.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	1998	20	8					1501	1525		10.1093/plankt/20.8.1501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.8.1501													WOS:000075493300006

We analysed lake sediments from Limni Zazari (Northern Greece) to reconstruct the past local vegetation and fire history with a special focus on land use and its impacts on erosion and lake eutrophication. Our data suggest a rather dense steppic vegetation after ca 20,000 cal BP (18050 cal BC). Forest expansion with Pinus sylvestris and admixed Quercus pubescens started around 14,500 cal BP (12550 cal BC). After the onset of the Holocene, mixed deciduous sub-mediterranean oak forests expanded, accompanied by rapidly decreasing soil erosion rates and increasing aquatic biological productivity. Pollen of cereals and Plantago lanceolata suggests continuous farming activities in the region after 8,200 cal BP (6250 cal BC), in agreement with archaeological evidence. Fairly closed mixed pine-oak forests dominated the landscape until ca 3,500 cal BP (1550 cal BC) that were only temporarily reduced during the Neolithic around 7,100 and 6,500 cal BP (5150 and 4550 cal BC). Land cover changes and aquatic biogeochemistry were closely linked during this period. Forest phases corresponded to lake eutrophication and hypolimnetic anoxia (meromixis), whereas during periods of deforestation (e.g. around 8,200 cal BP/6250 cal BC) soil erosion rates and lake mixing increased, while aquatic productivity decreased. After 3,500 cal BP (1550 cal BC) humans disrupted forests and open land vegetation expanded (e.g. Artemisia, Rumex-type, Cichorioideae, Chenopodiaceae). With the onset of the Iron Age (ca. 3,050 cal BP/1100 cal BC) grassland communities expanded massively and pine-oak forests gradually declined. Anthropogenic pressure on forests increased even more during the past 500 years. Finally, forest recovery during the recent decades led to decreased erosion and increased lake productivity. We conclude that over the millennia, intense pastoral and arable activities shaped both aquatic and terrestrial environments, ultimately creating a humanized vegetation mosaic in which the original natural mixed deciduous oak forests only form relict stands. Future climate warming and decreasing anthropogenic pressure may release a rapid spread of mixed deciduous oak forests around Limni Zazari.					; Schworer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Schwörer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Hafner, Albert/ABH-4856-2020	Panajiotidis, Sampson/0000-0003-1236-9000; Hafner, Albert/0000-0003-2159-8569; Makri, Stamatina/0000-0003-0309-3620; Schworer, Christoph/0000-0002-8884-8852; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Giagkoulis, Tryfon/0000-0002-0956-6866; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				JAN	2020	29	1					75	90		10.1007/s00334-019-00734-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-019-00734-5													WOS:000515882800006

Changes since the onset of acid deposition among calcium-sensitive cladoceran taxa within softwater lakes of Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Aqueous calcium (Ca) concentrations are currently decreasing in many softwater lakes on the Boreal Shield. As the onset of these declines often pre-date direct monitoring programs, indirect techniques are required to examine the impacts of reduced Ca availability on aquatic communities with relatively high Ca demands such as the Cladocera (Class: Branchiopoda). Among the Cladocera, the family Daphniidae has been identified as a taxonomic group potentially useful for inferring past Ca concentrations due to their high Ca demands and preservation in lake sediments. Here, we use a "top/bottom" paleolimnological analysis to compare present-day cladoceran communities preserved in the surface sediments of 36 softwater lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada, which are potentially vulnerable to Ca decline (i.e. small headwater systems with present-day lakewater [Ca] < 3 mg L-1), with the communities present in lake sediments deposited prior to the onset of regional acid deposition. To distinguish the potential impacts of lake acidification from those of Ca availability (as Ca and pH trends are strongly correlated in this region), the study lakes were chosen to be evenly distributed about a present-day lakewater pH of 6 and Ca concentration of 1.5 mg L-1 (threshold values). Despite the importance of pH as an explanatory variable for the present-day assemblages, a comparison of the sedimentary remains from the two time periods indicate there have been large declines since pre-industrial times in the relative abundances of Ca-rich Daphnia spp. (particularly of the Daphnia longispina species complex), regardless of present-day pH, accompanied by increases in the Ca-poor species Holopedium glacialis. These observations suggest that recent declines in Ca concentration may have already fallen below baseline conditions, with marked implications for ecosystem function due to the differential responses among cladoceran taxa.

Secondary normal faulting in the Lake Mead fault system and implications for regional fault mechanics	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The hypothesized presence of a detachment underlying the Lake Mead region has created a dichotomy in the interpretations of the roles of strike-slip faults of the Lake Mead fault system in accommodating regional deformation. Our detailed field mapping reveals a previously unnamed left-lateral strike-slip segment of the Lake Mead fault system and a dense cluster of dominantly west-dipping and related normal faults located near Pinto Ridge. We suggest that the strike-slip fault that we refer to as the Pinto Ridge fault: (1) was kinematically related to the Bitter Spring Valley fault; (2) was responsible for the creation of the normal fault cluster at Pinto Ridge; and (3) utilized these normal faults as linking structures between separate strike-slip fault segments to create a longer, through-going fault. Results from numerical models demonstrate that the observed location and curving strike patterns of the normal fault cluster are consistent with the faults having formed as secondary structures as the result of the perturbed stress field around the slipping Pinto Ridge fault, regardless of whether or not the Pinto Ridge fault merges into a regional detachment at depth. Calculations of mechanical efficiency of various normal fault geometries within extending terranes suggest that a preferred west dip of normal faults likely reflects a west-dipping anisotropy at depth, such as a detachment. The apparent terminations of numerous strike-slip faults of the Lake Mead fault system into west-dipping normal faults suggest that a west-dipping detachment may be regionally coherent.

J	Henny, CJ				Henny, CJ			DDE still high in white-faced Ibis eggs from Carson Lake, Nevada	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) eggs collected in 1996 at Carson Lake, Nevada, showed no decrease in p,p'-DDE (DDE) concentrations from levels in 1985 and 1986 which is contrary to DDE patterns shown for most avian species. An estimated 40-45% of the population was adversely affected by DDE in 1985, 1986, and 1996 with a probable net loss of about 20% of the expected productivity. One segment of the nesting population at Carson Lake in 1996 averaged 18.3% eggshell thinning, although the mean for the whole population is not known. Obvious population declines of White-faced Ibis have not been reported, although quantitative population data are incomplete; however, the excellent and predictable food sources on the breeding grounds in Nevada (due to flood irrigation by farmers) appear to contribute to a high reproductive potential. While adverse consequences of DDE were not documented at the population level, it is important to locate the source(s) of the DDE/p,p'-DDT (DDT). Re suits of a previous study showed that prey from the breeding grounds were not contaminated with DDE/DDT. The White-faced Ibis DDE/DDT loads are suspected to originate from localized areas on the wintering grounds and/or staging areas. Use of satellite transmitters placed on nesting birds is proposed to locate the source of the DDE/DDT.																			0738-6028						1997	20	3					478	484		10.2307/1521598	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521598													WOS:000071187500010

Therefore, it is still unknown whether centennial climate variations of the last ten thousand years convey a universal climate change or merely represent a characteristic of the Holocene. Recently published high resolution climate proxy records for the LGM allowed us to extrapolate climate-solar linkages on centennial time scales ahead of the Holocene. Here we present the analysis of a high resolution pollen concentration record from Lake Kotokel in southern Siberia, Russia, during the LGM. The record reflects the dynamics of vegetation zones and temperature change with a resolution of similar to 40 years in the continental climate of north-eastern Asia. We demonstrate that our pollen concentration record, the oxygen isotope delta O-18 record from the Greenland ice core project NGRIP (NorthGRIP), the dust-fall contributions in Lake Qinghai, China, grain size in the Gulang and Jingyuan loess deposits, China, and the composite oxygen isotope delta O-18 record from the Alpine cave system 7H reveal cooler to warmer climate fluctuations between similar to 20.6 and 26 ka. Such fluctuations correspond to the similar to 1000-yr, 500-600-yr and 210-250-yr cycles possibly linked to the solar activity variations and recognized in high resolution Holocene proxies all over the world. We further show that climate fluctuations in the LGM and Holocene are spectrally similar suggesting that linkages between climate proxies and solar activity at the centennial time scale in the Holocene can be extended to the LGM.

J	Hutorowicz, A				Hutorowicz, Andrzej			A Retrospective Ecological Status Assessment of the Lakes Based on Historical and Current Maps of Submerged Vegetation-A Case Study from Five Stratified Lakes in Poland	WATER												This article presents and tests a new method for the retrospective assessment of ecological status assessment of the lakes in accordance with the Ecological State Macophyte Index (ESMI), which is formally used in biological monitoring in Poland. The proposed method is based on three metrics, the Z colonization index, the average maximum depth of lake vegetation C-max, and the Secchi disk depth. Mathematical functions of ecological class were developed on the basis of the mean values of these three indicators in summer for different ecological status classes in 88 stratified lakes in northern Poland and the Leczynsko-Wlodawskie Lake District and five lakes in the catchment area of the Wel River (published data). The new metrics were validated on the basis of literature data-ESMI, C-max, Z and SD values from 11 lakes near Olsztyn (Poland). The obtained results are similar to those calculated based on macrophyte field surveys and can be an alternative of the Ecological State Macophyte Index (ESMI), which is formally used in biological monitoring in Poland. The proposed method makes it possible to compare long-term changes in the ecological state of lakes, because it enables an analogous assessment on the basis of data calculated from historical bathymetric maps showing the distribution of hydro macrophytes (parameters Z and C-max) as well as contemporary data, collected, among others, during hydroacoustic research.

MODIS 8-day composite data for three consecutive years viz 2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05 were used to study the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of water regime in the lake. Digital elevation model derived using Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission data with interpolated bottom topography was used to generate elevation contours and compute water volume from water spread data. The reference data of 2002 (drought year) shows the maximum extent of wetland to be 8.06 km(2) with emergent vegetation of recorded as 2.36 km(2) and open-water as 5.70 km(2). The rainfall has an impact on the preferred habitat availability for various species of avifauna and it is noted that emergent vegetation present in the lake completely dried up by summer 2002, a rainfall deficit year but revived again in the preceding year i.e. 2003 which was a good rainfall year with 46.68 km(2) under emergent vegetation and 61.96 km(2) under open-water. The 2002 being a drought year has shown very low reference storage (0.256 MCM), which has shown a gradual decrease in the storage to 0.00019 MCM in March 2003. The reference storage also registered a steep increase to 18.165 MCM in October 2003 and decreased 1.264 MCM in March 2004. From this study it is evident that water level of about 9 m elevation at the end of the rainy season is found to be optimal for maintaining various habitats that in turn support the avifauna for the rest of the lean period.																			2194-9034						2011	38-8	W20					199	203																WOS:000358386000040

The lithology of these reservoirs is complicated, with rapid vertical changes, making accurate description difficult. Based on the thininterbedded coal-bearing strata in the Wujiu Depression in eastern Inner Mongolia, China, this study constructs changes in lithofacies based on a Markov mathematical and statistical model. The Shengli subdepression mainly features a lithofacies sequence of uniform coal-mud-sand cycles and other small-scale symmetrical sedimentary cycles. In the Moguai-Shiwalu subdepression, lake hydrodynamics primarily affect coal-mudstone and mudstone-sandstone double-cycle lithofacies sequences and small-scale asymmetric sedimentary cycles. The Markov model and the Ward minimum variance method were used to quantitatively couple a reservoir lithologic sequence and bed thickness configuration, and five basic configurations of the composite reservoir of the Damoguaihe Formation in the study area were obtained: (1) multiseam interbedded configuration, (2) multiseam interbedded configuration with an intermediate number of seams, (3) interbedded configuration with an intermediate number or few seams (with thick mudstone or sandstone layers), (4) interbedded configuration with few seams (large spacings between adjacent coal seams) and (5) thickly interbedded configuration. The sedimentary facies mechanism controlling the spatial distribution pattern of composite reservoirs is discussed. It is concluded that the sedimentary system domain and lake size have a significant effect on the configuration of composite reservoirs. For small terrestrial lakes, the stability of sedimentary environment and the rapid and frequent rise and fall of the lake surface results in significant differences in coal accumulation in a short distance from the edge to the center.

In this chapter, we review recent literature concerning levels and trends of BFRs in environmental samples, mainly published between 2008 and early 2010. In many areas of the world, controls have been put in place regarding the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and environmental concentrations are beginning to fall as a result. Investigations into the potential impacts of TBBP-A in Asia, around sites of manufacture and first use, are still required in order to assess the risks of continued production and use. The use of "novel" BFRs is being studied in order to assess their significance and potential impacts, as their environmental presence has been noted recently in a number of studies. New sources have emerged, such as e-waste recycling operations. In addition, secondary sources, such as glacier ice and permafrost soils, might become increasingly important in the future as a result of climate change. There is still concern that BDE209 (from the deca-mix PBDE technical product) may be debrominated in the environment to yield lower brominatecl BDE congeners, particularly as a large reservoir of BDE209 is accumulating in sediments. Even today, many ecosystems and regions are not studied well enough for us to be able to establish a global overview concerning BFR concentrations and their toxic effects.																			1433-6863		978-3-642-19268-5				2011	16						123	140		10.1007/698_2010_82	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/698_2010_82	10.1007/978-3-642-19269-2												WOS:000291322400005

Ellesmere Island. The vegetation is high arctic, but locally relatively rich, with areas of Cassiope tetragona-Empetrum-Vaccinium uliginosum heath on thesteep slopes above the lake. Cores were taken from the basin center through .apprx. 15 m of water. Basal sandy-silt is overlain by 51 cm of laminated silty-gyttja and fine detritus gyttja grading upwards to loose algal gyttja. Three radiocarbon dates indicate rates of sedimentation from 0.07 to 0.04 mm yr-1. Pollen concentration varies from 1500 to 2000 per cm3 in the lower part of the core to 100 to 200 in the upper part; calculated pollen influx is between < and 14 grains/cm2 per year. Four local pollen assemblage zones reflect an early pioneer phase (grass-sedge-Oxyria) in the lowermost organic sediment, followed by the appearance and spread of Salix some 8000 yr ago and then, some 7000 yr ago, by a rise in Ericales. A period of vegetational stability within dwarf-shrub heaths follows, lasting for over 3000 yr. The topmost zone shows some increase in indicators of bare ground and fell-field vegetation (Saxifraga, Ranunculus, Papaver, Caryophyllaceae, Dryas) and decline in pollen influx, hence deterioration of local conditions during the last 3500 to 4000 yr.																			0300-9483	1502-3885					1985	14	1					19	32																WOS:A1985AHS2200002

A new chronostratigraphic framework is developed based on the appearance of specific benthic foraminifera species along with changes in carbonate/X-ray fluorescence and grain size data. This allowed the correlation of cores based on a series of radiocarbon dated tie points. Analysing the cores together reveals several events recorded in the Skagerrak including: (i) an increased freshwater input (bracketed between 13.3 and 11.3 cal. ka BP) signified by radiogenic 187Os/188Os values, high %C37:4 values and an increase in sand content; (ii) the Glomma drainage event, signified by a sudden appearance of Valvulineria as well as higher %C37:4; and (iii) the opening of the Danish Straits and English Channel leading to the development of modern-day conditions and circulation patterns in the Skagerrak, signified by the appearance of Hyalinea balthica and a fall in %C37:4. We use foraminifera, X-ray fluorescence and grain-size data alongside radiocarbon dating to provide a chronostratigraphic framework linking together cores from the Skagerrak. Using this and changes in sand content, Ca/K, biomarkers (%C37:4), osmium isotope values (187Os/188Os) and foraminifera, we show evidence of three events in the Skagerrak from the Lateglacial to Middle Holocene. These include a freshwater input, the Glomma River drainage and the opening of the Danish Straits and English Channel. image						Ownsworth, Emma/0000-0002-0379-5254													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2024	53	3					360	375		10.1111/bor.12652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12652		FEB 2024											WOS:001160527100001
J	Herbst, DB				Herbst, David B.			Salinity controls on trophic interactions among invertebrates and algae of solar evaporation ponds in the Mojave Desert and relation to shorebird foraging and selenium risk	WETLANDS												Three saline evaporation ponds formed by wastewater from a solar energy-generating facility near Harper Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert of California, USA were compared for differences in the communities of benthic and planktonic invertebrates and algae present along with avian visitation and foraging activity. Salinity of the ponds ranged from near 90 to over 200 g L-1 total dissolved solids. During the period of study (1997-1999), the lowest salinity pond averaged 98 g L-1, the intermediate salinity pond 112 g L-1, and the high salinity pond 173 g L-1. Differences in the biological communities, abundance of invertebrates and algae, and avian foraging were examined in relation to these differences in salinity. Only three aquatic invertebrate species were present in substantial numbers, a water boatman (Trichocorixa reticulata), a brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), and a brine fly (Ephydra gracilis). An abundance of the predator Trichocorixa under low salinity conditions appeared to reduce algae-grazing Artemia, and so released phytoplankton growth, but this was observed only in surveys later in the growth season when populations were mature and had greatest potential for efficient consumption of resources. Brine fly larvae were also fed upon by Trichocorixa and were least abundant in the low salinity pond. At highest salinities where Trichocorixa could not survive, Artemia were abundant and waters were usually clear, becoming dense with phytoplankton only during the winter dormancy of brine shrimp. Intermediate salinity levels supported some water boatmen, often coexisting with dense brine shrimp and phytoplankton populations, and the greatest dry mass of benthic brine fly larvae and pupae. The high salinity pond produced abundant but small Ephydra larvae and pupae, accompanied by reduced emergence success of adult flies. Birds appeared to forage primarily on benthic brine fly larvae and were most successful in the intermediate salinity pond, possibly because lower salinity resulted in loss of this preferred prey to water boatman predation, and high salinity produced prey of poor quality. These observations suggest that reduced salinity may at times mediate a trophic cascade within a simple food chain, where an invertebrate predator may reduce primary consumers and permit enhanced algal density, but the predation control becomes uncoupled as salinity increases. In the case of the ponds studied here, there appeared to be minimal risk associated with selenium poisoning of water birds because Se was not detected in brine fly larvae or pupae and was found only occasionally in low content in the brine shrimp and corixids and mostly in locales where few birds were found feeding.

J	Camacho, A; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR				Camacho, A; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR			Spatio-temporal distribution and growth dynamics of phototrophic sulfur bacteria populations in the sulfide-rich Lake Arcas	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Areas exhibits a thermal stratification from April to October. A sulfide-rich anoxic hypolimnion is then formed between the deeper part of the thermocline and the lake bottom, and high population densities of phototrophic microorganisms are found at the oxic-anoxic interface. Chromatium weissei, a large rod, 8 x 4 mum in size, was the dominant phototrophic bacterium, reaching densities of up to 1.84 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). Other phototrophic sulfur bacteria, such as Amoebobacter cf. purpureus, Thiocapsa sp., and Pelodictyon clathratiforme were also present in the anoxic hypolimnion, but their cell size and population densities were much lower. Net growth rates (0.125 to -0.123 d(-1)) and frequency of dividing cells, indicated that C. weissei grew most rapidly in the upper part of the phototrophic bacterial layer. The highest growth rates were found during the first half of the stratification period, with a marked decrease in population density as mixing approached. Our results suggest that purple sulfur bacteria in Lake Areas are light limited, even though they possess okenone, which can efficiently harvest Light at the wavelengths penetrating to the chemocline. High rates of carbon photoassimilation by phototrophic bacteria were measured (up to 200 mg C m(-3) h(-1)), but because of the narrow depth range in which anoxygenic photosynthesis occur, bacterial contribution to overall primary production during summer was estimated to he only 12-13%.					; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010													1015-1621						2000	62	4					334	349		10.1007/PL00001339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001339													WOS:000166273800004

Predictive models for future changes in lake Ca are generally based on catchment-scale studies, but these models rarely account for unmeasured sources of Ca supply that are common in the nearshore areas of developed lakes. In this study we utilize up to 29 years of hydrological and water chemistry data for three lakes in central Ontario that differ in degree of human intervention to demonstrate that shoreline development may exert large effects on Ca mass balances. In the relative absence of shoreline development, Red Chalk Lake exhibited what we consider to be the normal response, a reduction in Ca load from the catchment over the last three decades, leading to a reduction in lake export and lake Ca concentration. Calcium load, export, and lake water Ca concentration also fell in Harp Lake, but less than in Red Chalk Lake, because Ca loads were elevated by human activities in Harp Lake's moderately developed shoreline area. By contrast, Dickie Lake experienced an exceptional change in Ca dynamics: both export and lake concentrations rose because of elevated load from the shoreline area linked to the use of dust suppressants on gravel roads. Reductions in both stream Ca concentration and flow volume have led to calcium decline in streams and lakes. Long-term soil acidification processes and climatic variability with its link to hydrology can explain the general pattern of Ca decline in lakes on the south-central Canadian Shield. However, given the widespread lakeshore development and use of dust suppressants on gravel roads, predictions of lake Ca levels need to take into account nearshore activities, especially those that augment rates of Ca supply.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215													0043-1397					JUN 22	2011	47								W06521	10.1029/2010WR010159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR010159													WOS:000292152600001

Treatment is limited to descent to lower altitude and administration of oxygen. Methods and Results-We studied the acute effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO), 50% oxygen, and a mixture of NO plus 50% oxygen on hemodynamics and gas exchange in 14 patients with HAPE. Each gas mixture was given in random order for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes washout with room air. All patients had severe HAPE as judged by Lake Louise score (6.4+/-0.7), Pao(2) (35+/-3.1 mm Hg), and alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference (AaDo(2)) (26+/-3 mm Hg). NO had a selective effect on the pulmonary vasculature and did not alter systemic hemodynamics. Compared with room air, pulmonary vascular resistance fell 36% with NO (P<0.001), 23% with oxygen (P<0.001 versus air, P<0.05 versus NO alone), and 54% with NO plus 50% oxygen (P<0.001 versus air, P<0.005 versus oxygen and versus NO). NO alone improved Pao(2) (+14%) and AaDo(2) (-31%). Compared with 50% oxygen alone, NO plus 50%, oxygen had a greater effect on AaDo(2) (-18%) and Pao(2) (+21%). Conclusions-Inhaled NO may have a therapeutic role in the management of HAPE, The combined use of inhaled NO and oxygen has additive effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and even greater effects on gas exchange. These findings indicate that oxygen and NO may act on separate but interactive mechanisms in the pulmonary vasculature.

J	Zhao, SC; Sun, HY; Cheng, J; Zhang, GQ				Zhao, Shaochun; Sun, Hongyan; Cheng, Jie; Zhang, Guoqing			Water Surface Temperature Dynamics of the Three Largest Ice-Contact Lakes in the Patagonia Icefield over the Last 20 Years	WATER												The Patagonia Icefield, the largest ice mass in the Southern Hemisphere outside Antarctica, has experienced significant growth and expansion of ice-contact lakes in recent decades, with lake surface water temperature (LSWT) being one of the key influencing factors. LSWT affects glacier melting at the waterline and accelerates glacier mass loss. However, the observations of ice-contact LSWT are often limited to short-term, site-based field measurements, which hinders long-term, whole-lake monitoring. This study examines LSWT for the three largest ice-contact lakes in the Patagonia Icefield-Lake Argentino, Lake Viedma, and Lake O'Higgins, each exceeding 1000 km(2)-and the three largest nearby non-ice-contact lakes for comparison using MODIS data between 2002 and 2022. In 2022, the mean LSWTs for Lake Argentino, Lake Viedma, and Lake O'Higgins were 7.2, 7.0, and 6.4 degrees C, respectively. In summer, ice-contact lakes exhibited wider LSWT ranges and more pronounced cooling near glacier termini and warming farther away compared to other seasons, demonstrating glacier melt cooling and its seasonal variability. Over the past 20 years, both Lake Viedma and Lake O'Higgins showed a warming rate of +0.20 degrees C dec(-1), p > 0.1, with slower warming near the glacier, reflecting glacier contact suppression on the LSWT trend. Conversely, Lake Argentino displayed a significant warming rate of +0.43 degrees C dec(-1) (p < 0.05), with faster rates near the glacier terminus, possibly linked to a prolonged and large (>64 km(2)) iceberg accumulation event from March 2010 to October 2011 in Glacier Upsala's fjord. Iceberg mapping shows that larger events caused more pronounced short-term (24 days) LSWT cooling in Lake Argentino's ice-proximal region. This study highlights the role of glacier-lake interactions including calving events in regulating ice-contact lake water temperature.

J	Mischke, S; Weynell, M; Zhang, CJ; Wiechert, U				Mischke, Steffen; Weynell, Marc; Zhang, Chengjun; Wiechert, Uwe			Spatial variability of 14C reservoir effects in Tibetan Plateau lakes	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Radiocarbon dating of lake sediments is often hampered by the presence of a lake reservoir effect (LRE, also 'dead carbon' or 'old carbon' effect) especially in dry and cold regions with a sparse plant cover in the catchment. The Tibetan Plateau became a hotspot of the palaeoenvironmental and climate research community in recent years and the assessment of present-day LREs is a crucial prerequisite for the establishment of reliable radiocarbon age depth relationships for lake sediment cores. This paper examines the spatial variability of LREs within individual lakes, through a discussion of new data for Lake Donggi Cona and a compilation of previously published data for five additional lakes where LRE data are available for different sites. Lake reservoir effects for Lake Donggi Cona on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were determined for shells of aquatic snails collected alive close to the lake's shore. The largest determined LRE of 20,000 C-14 years is significantly larger than previously reported LREs from the central part of the lake, and larger than any previously published LRE for the Tibetan Plateau. Relatively low LREs in the central regions of lakes, higher LREs towards the margins, and high LREs in tributaries and spring waters are apparently a common pattern of Tibetan Plateau lakes. The differences in LREs within individual lakes or catchment areas are attributed to the more prolonged exchange of the lake water's dissolved inorganic carbon with the atmospheric CO2 in central lake regions on the one hand and the increasing influence of C-14 free or poor stream and groundwater due to the dissolution of carbonaceous basement rocks towards its margins. Generally higher LREs were recorded in the three tectonically active lake regions of the six examined catchments, and it is speculated that rising crustal CO2 further contributes to the LREs in these catchments. In addition to these observations and inferences, elevated C-14 levels of the atmosphere as a result of nuclear bomb testing are often ignored if LREs for modern materials are reported by convention relative to the atmospheric C-14 activity of the year 1950. LRE data reported in this way represent unrealistic minimum estimates.

J	Hill, NM; Keddy, PA; Wisheu, IC				Hill, NM; Keddy, PA; Wisheu, IC			A hydrological model for predicting the effects of dams on the shoreline vegetation of lakes and reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The species richness of shoreline vegetation of unregulated lakes in Nova Scotia, Canada, is known to increase as a function of catchment area, a topographic variable governing water level fluctuations. Predictions based on catchment area however, fail to account for richness pat terns at the margins of lakes enlarged by darns. Here, we compare the vegetation and hydrological regimes of regulated and unregulated systems. Hydrological regimes of regulated systems deviated from natural systems of similar catchment area by being either hypovariable or hypervariable for both within-year and among-year fluctuations in water level. Plant communities of dammed systems were less diverse, contained more exotic species, and were, with one exception, devoid of rare shoreline herbs. Data from "recovering," or previously dammed systems indicated that shoreline communities can be restored upon return of the appropriate hydrological regime. Using observed within-year and among-year water level fluctuation data, we propose a general model for the maintenance or restoration of diverse herbaceous wetlands on shorelines of temperate lakes or reservoirs. Managers can manipulate the within-year water level variation within prescribed limits (1-2 m), while ensuring that among-year variation (SD of summer levers) is less than 25% of within-year variation. This preliminary model is based on data from low-fertility temperate lakes in river systems. To calibrate the model, plant community data from other regions are needed, as are long-term water-level data for unregulated lakes, data which are essential but largely lacking in many areas.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP-OCT	1998	22	5					723	736		10.1007/s002679900142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002679900142								9680540					WOS:000075196600007

The small spatial and temporal scales of thunderstorms are not resolved in global climate models (GCMs). In this study, the relationship is established between thunderstorm observations from nine weather stations across Southern Ontario, Canada, and daily maximum convective available potential energy (CAPE). The results from the correlation analysis between CAPE and thunderstorm days suggested that the probability of observing a thunderstorm increases as maximum daily CAPE increases. We then utilize the novel approach of applying statistical downscaling (SDSM) to CAPE. After regenerating CAPE over a 30-year reference period (1981-2010) at each weather station, it was determined that the SDSM-modeled CAPE values well compared to observed CAPE values. Future CAPE values up to the end of the current century are then projected using the SDSM models for each station in combination with three GCMs for future climate. The forecast from the downscaling suggested large increases, as much as tripling, in annual mean CAPE, summer mean CAPE, and number of days exceeding a 50% probability and 80% probability of observing a thunderstorm at all weather stations under SRES business-as-usual and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the study period of 2011-2100. All else being equal, this suggests an increase in the number of days with conditions favorable for thunderstorms under a warmer climate.

This study focuses on four representative mountain lakes-Azigza (LaZ), Ouiouan (LaO), the central lake of Tiglmamine (c-LaT), and Abakhan (LaB)-over the period from 1984 to 2023. These lakes are critical components of local hydrosystems, providing both ecological services and socioeconomic support in a region highly sensitive to climatic variability and increasing anthropogenic pressures. Study focus: The research investigates the long-term surface water dynamics using multi-temporal Landsat imagery and spectral indices, complemented by field observations. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used to delineate lake surfaces, achieving an accuracy of 83 %. In parallel, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field data were employed to evaluate the influence of human activities. Particular emphasis was placed on understanding the role of climate variability and agricultural intensification in altering lake dynamics. New hydrological insights for the region: Findings reveal substantial reductions in lake surface areas, particularly between 2010 and 2023. LaB experienced a dramatic 95 % loss, nearing desiccation, while LaZ, c-LaT, and LaO declined by 52 %, 35 %, and 4 %, respectively. Around LaB, cultivated land expanded by over 300 %, indicating a pronounced anthropogenic impact. These results emphasize the urgent need for sustainable water and land management practices to safeguard these vulnerable high-altitude hydrosystems.

The database was constructed by utilizing satellite imagery with varying resolutions, including Landsat 7 ETM + (2000; 30/15 m), Sentinel 2A (2020; 10 m), LISS IV (2020; 5.8 m), and Planet Scope (2020; 3 m). Furthermore, by utilizing slope-dependent numerical approaches, power scaling methods, and modelling techniques (GlabTop2 and HIGTHIM), an attempt has been undertaken to assess the glacier ice thickness, volume and water stored in the DMR. The overall extent of glaciers has exhibited a decline from 50.8 (+/- 4.38 km(2)) to 42.84 (+/- 0.83 km(2)) during the course of the past two decades (2000-2020), resulting in a total reduction of 7.98 +/- 4.45 km(2) (similar to 15.71 +/- 8.76%). Nevertheless, while considering glacier lakes, there has been an observed increase in both number and size. Specifically, the number of glacier lakes has risen from 36 (with an average area of 0.91 +/- 0.36 km(2)) in 2000 to 43 (with an average area of 1.18 +/- 0.08 km(2)) in 2020. This represents a growth rate of 19.45% in terms of number and 29 +/- 40.5% in terms of size. The presence of seven newly formed lakes can be attributed to their proglacial nature, indicating and providing evidence for the retreat of the glacier that previously occupied the area. The estimation of ice thickness utilizing the GlabTop2 and HIGTHIM models indicates a range of ice thickness from 9 +/- 0.9 to 111.69 +/- 11.7 m, with mean values of 36.51 +/- 3.63 and 33.37 +/- 4.32 m, respectively. The estimated volume and mass of glacier ice are reported as 10.4 +/- 0.24 km(3) and 9.36 +/- 0.22 gigatons, respectively. Our meteorological trend analysis suggests that temperature increases with a slope of 0.023 degrees K a(-1) and precipitation decrease with a slope of 1.425 mm a(-1) between 1940 and 2022. Increased accumulation season temperature (winter time) is the primary cause for the reduction of glacier coverage. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of glacier dynamics and their impact on water supply. The generated glacier lake inventory assumes significance specifically for the stakeholders in the formulation of a complete risk assessment strategy for future glacier lake outburst floods.					; Sahu, Rakesh/AFG-8751-2022; Sahu, Dr. Rakesh/AFG-8751-2022; Rai, ShashiKant/KIH-0456-2024	KUMAR, ARUN/0000-0002-0467-3443; Sahu, Rakesh/0000-0001-6560-8621; Rai, Shashi Kant/0000-0001-8920-8999; dhar, sunil/0000-0002-5671-6628; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2024	52	3					633	644		10.1007/s12524-024-01849-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-024-01849-7		MAR 2024											WOS:001190487400002
J	Allis, RG				Allis, RG			Review of subsidence at Wairakei field, New Zealand	GEOTHERMICS												Maximum ground subsidence of 14 m occurred at Wairakei geothermal field between 1950 and 1997 due to development of the field for power generation. The centre of the subsidence bowl is now subsiding at 220 mm/year, after having reached a maximum of 480 mm/year during the mid-1970s. Most of the subsidence is concentrated in a circular area of less than 1 km(2), centred 500 m from the edge of the production borefield. Smaller rates of subsidence (10-100 mm/year) have occurred over a 30 km(2) area of the field affected by fluid withdrawal for the power plant. Horizontal ground movements ranging to over 200 mm/year, and extensional strain rates of 3 x 10(-4)/year, were measured around the flanks of the subsidence bowl during the mid-1970s. Fissures developed in the areas of greatest extension rate and rigid structures such as pipelines, roads, concrete drains and transmission lines have required maintenance where they traverse the subsidence bowl. A pond has formed in the centre of the bowl, and has influenced groundwater levels in the adjacent borefield. The cause of the subsidence is considered to be compaction of a high-porosity, low-permeability lacustrine mudstone at 100-200 m depth. These sediments continue to drain at a slow rate despite pressure stabilisation in the underlying aquifers and the main reservoir during the early 1980s. The small areal extent of the subsidence bowl compared to that of the mudstone is attributed to under-compaction of these lake sediments as they accumulated over the main hot spring outflow zone during the last 100,000 years.

In this study we define characteristics of 55 waterbodies with and without Bythotrephes in Europe, and use these distributions to predict the species' occurrence in 49 lakes in the Great Lakes basin of North America. Lakes in Europe that supported Bythotrephes were significantly larger, deeper, had higher transparency and lower maximum bottom temperature during summer, and lower total chlorophyll concentration, than those that lacked the species. These patterns also were observed for lakes in North America, although differences between invaded and noninvaded basins were significant only for lake area and maximum depth. A discriminant function model correctly predicted Bythotrephes occurrence in 91% of study lakes in Europe, and was influenced most by Secchi disk transparency and lake surface area. Application of this model to North America correctly predicted occurrence of Bythotrephes in 82% (18 of 22) of lakes in which the species has been recorded. However, the model incorrectly predicted Bythotrephes presence in 74% (20 of 27) of lakes in which the species has not yet been observed. These findings indicate that many of the study lakes in the Great Lakes basin may be vulnerable to invasion by Bythotrephes. Human activities responsible for Bythotrephes dispersal must be curtailed to reduce additional invasions in Europe and the Great Lakes region.					; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0003-9136					AUG	2000	149	1					1	21																WOS:000088591500001

This study aimed at revealing the characteristics of submerged cavities on the southern Romanian continental shelf where six protected areas exist. We used high-resolution bathymetry data and side-scan sonar imaging to identify limestone outcrops where cavities would be most probable to form and then performed visual observation during SCUBA diving activities. We found that submerged cavities appear in all marine-protected areas and their neighboring unprotected areas from the shore to similar to 20-m depth mostly in the form of caverns, niches, and overhangs that meet the physical requirements of the habitat type 8330 as defined by the European Commission. We propose that habitat type 8330 should be listed in the Natura 2000 Standard Data Forms of the protected areas where it is missing, and we also propose that some protected areas should be expanded to include important areas with the occurrence of this habitat type. Finally, we note here for the first time the occurrence of Movile-type karst and an associated sulfidic water spring on the southern shore of Lake Techirghiol, similar to the region near Mangalia where it was first described in the literature. Although our finding prompts for a more detailed study, it indicates the existence of an underground ecosystem similar to that from the well-studied Movile Cave, but isolated by a distance of over 20 km.					; Vlaicu, Marius/KEE-7959-2024; Pop, Maria/JXY-4971-2024; Dragusin, Virgil/P-6673-2019	Balan, Vasile-Sorin/0000-0001-7157-1108; dragusin, virgil/0000-0003-0221-1816; Vlaicu, Marius/0000-0002-6157-0280; Pop, Maria Mirabela/0009-0007-8221-473X													0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2023	195	12							1520	10.1007/s10661-023-12137-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-12137-1								37994974					WOS:001123389400005

MONITORING of chlorophyll-a and turbidity in Evros river (Greece) using Landsat imagery	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2013)	Proceedings of SPIE				1st International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	APR 08-10, 2013	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, Cyprus Univ Technol, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Cyprus Meteorol Serv, Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Frederick Univ, European Space Agcy, Intergraph (SG&I) Italia LLC, Hexagon, Geosystems Hellas, Neapolis Univ				Satellite products are utilized for numerous environmental applications nowadays including water quality monitoring and assessment. Various techniques have been developed during the last two decades for estimating environmental parameters such as chlorophyll-a and turbidity. In the context of this research effort, various algorithms have been developed to retrieve chlorophyll-a and turbidity values in Evros river, Greece, using satellite imageries of Landsat 5 TM. These imageries were obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) and covered the summer periods of 2008-2009 for chlorophyll-a and 2008-2011 for turbidity, respectively. Field data of relevant dates have been used for the development and validation of the remote sensing retrieval algorithms (separate datasets for the algorithm development and the validation process). The best applicable algorithms, using both the point sampling values and the remotely sensed data under different regression models, proved to be the ratio of TM4/TM3 bands and logarithmical ratio of TM1/TM2 bands for the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity values, respectively. This process resulted in the generation of maps showing the distribution of chlorophyll-a and turbidity along the river. Validation of the selected algorithms was also conducted by comparing the estimated chl-a concentrations and turbidity values with the corresponding in-situ measurements of the validation datasets. The results indicated a relatively high coefficient of determination (R-2), fact that characterizes the satellite developed algorithms reliable and efficient to monitor the chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in the particular riverine system.

J	Palijan, G				Palijan, Goran			DIFFERENT IMPACT OF FLOOD DYNAMICS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURABLE PLANKTONIC AND BIOFILM BACTERIA IN FLOODPLAIN LAKE	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Floodplains are lateral river extensions in which lotic, semi-lotic and lentic habitats are formed resulting in high habitat heterogeniety. Consequently biota development is highely influenced by its location within the floodplain and by the hydrological cycle. In the present paper the development of planktonic and biofilm bacteria associated with artificial substrates were investigated in the floodplain lake of the Danube River (Lake Sakadas, Croatia) during different hydrological situations. The aim of the study was to investigate if there was any difference in the bacterial development between two compartments plankton and biofilm, and how the floods influence these communities. The samples were taken monthly (July-November 2007) from surface and bottom water layer (plankton) and exposed glass slides (biofilm) at two sampling stations. For these purposes bacterial abundance was estimated by the determination of number of colony forming units (CFUs). The development of bacterioplankton was equal between the sites and had its maximum at the time of falling water after the flood pulse. Bacterioplankton abundance correlated significantly with water properties, and it had predictable dynamics comparable with the previous results established in the same floodplain area (Kopacki Rit). The development of biofilm bacteria differed between the sites, and had its maximum prior to the flood pulse, or during the flood. The abundance of attached bacteria correlated with biofilm biomass while it was not significantly correlated with the water properties. Such results describe different development of planktonic and biofilm bacteria. Biofilm bacteria are more independent, compared to bacterioplankton, from the floodplain hydrology.

Spatial distributions of polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A in Lake Erie sediment	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Forty-seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and its mono-, di- and tri-bromo-analogs, and bisphenol A (BPA) were investigated in sediments (56 samples; collected in spring 2004) from the western, central and eastern basins of Lake Erie. Surficial (0-10 cm) sediment from the western basin contained significantly greater (p<0.05) concentrations of Sigma PCBs, Sigma PBDEs and BPA than the other two basins. Sigma(47)PCBs were 144 141,33 34, and 13 15 ng/g (mean standard deviation (SD); dry weight, d.w.) in the western, central, and eastern basins respectively. For two of the surveyed sites, the Sigma(47)PCBs in sediment exceeded the Canadian sediment quality probable effect level of exposure guideline (PEL, 277 ng/g) for aquatic biota, indicating a risk to biota health in 2004. Sigma 8PBDE concentrations (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -138, -153, -154 and -183) were 1.33 +/- 2.54, 0.17 +/- 0.11, and 0.30 +/- 0.38 ng/g (mean SD; d.w.) in the western, central, and eastern basins, respectively. BDE-209 was the predominant PBDE congener in sediment samples, and was quantifiable in 56% of the samples with a concentration range of <0.3 to 12 ng/g (d.w.). BPA concentrations up to 6.1 ng/g (d.w.) were detected in 65% of the samples. For these chemicals, the Detroit River outflow is strongly suggested to be the major source/vector for Lake Erie. TBBPA was detectable in one sample (0.5 ng/g d.w.) from a site near the Detroit River, suggesting degradation and/or a low level deposition of polybrominated-BPAs to Lake Erie.

J	Eaton, BR; Tonn, WM; Paszkowski, CA; Danylchuk, AJ; Boss, SM				Eaton, BR; Tonn, WM; Paszkowski, CA; Danylchuk, AJ; Boss, SM			Indirect effects of fish winterkills on amphibian populations in boreal lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We exploited fish winterkills in small, boreal Alberta lakes to determine if anuran amphibians respond to large but natural changes in fish densities. Eight large declines in fish abundance occurred in seven lakes over a 5 year period, while major increases in fish abundance, reflecting recovery after winterkill, were recorded 5 times. Summer pitfall trapping of young-of-the-year (YOY) Wood Frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte, 1825) and Boreal (Bufo boreas boreas Baird and Girard, 1852) and Canadian (Bufo hemiophrys Cope, 1886) toads indicated that frog abundance responded consistently to such large changes in fish abundance, but especially if fish communities were dominated by small-bodied species (sticklebacks and minnows). As well, changes in YOY Wood Frog and fish abundance were negatively correlated; YOY Wood Frogs were as much as 7.7 times more abundant after winterkills than in non-winterkill years. These increases in metamorphs did not result from an increased immigration of breeding adults to winterkill lakes, suggesting instead that larval survival was greater. Higher abundance of YOY Wood Frogs and toads was associated with smaller body size at metamorphosis. Despite this apparent reduction in individual growth, abundance of juvenile frogs remained significantly elevated 1 year after winterkill. In contrast to Wood Frogs, YOY toads tended to respond positively to recoveries of small-fish populations. Because anuran amphibians can respond to fish winterkill, and because winterkill is a frequent natural disturbance, small fish-bearing lakes can serve as important breeding habitat for amphibians in Alberta's boreal forest.

Hard water oxygenated lakes are often thought to be less susceptible to P release from sediment due to precipitation of P with calcium carbonate and P sorption on iron (Fe) oxyhydroxides in oxidized surface sediments. However, perpetuated eutrophic conditions in many hard water oxygenated lakes persist despite drastic reduction of external P inputs. What limits P sediment binding capacity and drives its release from sediments in such lakes is often less understood. Here we characterize sediment P diagenetic processes driving persistent internal loading in the Bay of Quinte, a hard water, polymictic embayment of Lake Ontario, Canada. We used a multifaceted approach, combining a comprehensive three-year study of sediment P binding forms, recent sediment stratigraphy and accumulation, high spatial resolution measurement of dissolved oxygen, redox potential and pH across the sediment-water interface and depth profiles of nutrient and metals concentrations in pore water. Despite oxygenated bottom water conditions P diffusive fluxes during summer are substantial (1-6.5 mg P/m(2)/day), representing as much as 50% of external P inputs. Estimated rates of benthic organic carbon degradation indicate that anaerobic organic P mineralization in anoxic sediments is the main driver of P release, which is strongly influenced by Fe reduction. Estimated rates of benthic organic carbon degradation indicate that anaerobic organic P mineralization in anoxic sediments is the main driver of P release. In surface sediment the redox sensitive P is the prevailing diagenetically reactive P phase, emphasizing strong coupling with ferric Fe. While this indicates substantial P sorption on Fe oxyhydroxides, their spare binding capacity is limited, as reducible Fe: P ratios are close to sorption limit. The calcium carbonate bound P increased with sediment depth at the expense of redox sensitive P, suggesting diagenetic sequestration into apatite with sediment burial. However, only 40% of diagenetically reactive P forms, which account for similar to 2/3 of the total P in surface sediment, are permanently retained during burial. Importantly, our data show that in fact significant P-flux occurs in shallow areas, with an apparent discordance with concurrent measures of long-term P release from the sediments. These results also demonstrate that short-term measures cannot be extrapolated to long-term estimates and vice versa.

In the current study, we investigated a land-to-sea transition ecosystem called "Keri Lake" in Zakynthos Island, Greece. This ecosystem is unique due to asphalt oil springs found at several sites, a phenomenon already reported 2500 years ago. Sediment microbiomes at Keri Lake were studied, and their structure and functional potential were compared to other ecosystems with oil exposure histories of various time periods. Results: Replicate sediment cores (up to 3-m depth) were retrieved from one site exposed to oil as well as a nonexposed control site. Samples from three different depths were subjected to chemical analysis and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. At the oil-exposed site, we observed high amounts of asphalt oil compounds and a depletion of sulfate compared to the non-exposed control site. The numbers of reads assigned to genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons were similar between the two sites. The numbers of denitrifiers and sulfate reducers were clearly lower in the samples from the oil-exposed site, while a higher abundance of methanogens was detected compared to the non-exposed site. Higher abundances of the genes of methanogenesis were also observed in the metagenomes from other ecosystems with a long history of oil exposure, compared to short-term exposed environments. Conclusions: The analysis of Keri Lake metagenomes revealed that microbiomes in the oil-exposed sediment have a higher potential for methanogenesis over denitrification/sulfate reduction, compared to those in the non-exposed site. Comparison with metagenomes from various oil-impacted environments suggests that syntrophic interactions of hydrocarbon degraders with methanogens are favored in the ecosystems with a long-term presence of oil.

This study was conducted during early spring of 2013 and 2014 to monitor the concentration of PM at three different land surfaces (bare land, urban forest, and lake) in the Olympic Park in Beijing and to analyze its effect on the concentration of meteorological factors and the dry deposition onto different land cover types. The results showed that diurnal variation of PM concentrations at the three different land surfaces had no significant regulations, and sharp short-term increases in PM10 (particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu m) occurred occasionally. The concentrations also differed from one land cover type to another at the same time, but the regulation was insignificant. The most important meteorological factor influencing the PM concentration is relative humidity; it is positively correlated with the PM concentration. While in the forests, the wind speed and irradiance also influenced the PM concentration by affecting the capture capacity of trees and dry deposition velocity. Other factors were not correlated with or influenced by the PM concentration. In addition, the hourly dry deposition in unit area (mu g/m(2)) onto the three types of land surfaces and the removal efficiency based on the ratio of dry deposition and PM concentration were calculated. The results showed that the forest has the best removal capacity for both PM2.5 (particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m) and PM10 because of the faster deposition velocity and relatively low resuspension rate. The lake's PM10 removal efficiency is higher than that of the bare land because of the relatively higher PM resuspension rates on the bare land. However, the PM2.5 removal efficiency is lower than that of the bare land because of the significantly lower dry deposition velocity.					zhang, zhenming/GXA-0983-2022; Liu, Jiakai/L-9946-2014														0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2016	23	1					408	417		10.1007/s11356-015-5252-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5252-6								26308922					WOS:000368199300038

Introduced fish were selected to possess malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isozyme phenotypes different from native walleye. The fingerlings were also fin clipped. During the summer months of 1973, 1974 and 1975 fish were recaptured by gill net. Muscle from recaptured fish was used for the determination of MDH isozyme phenotype whereby the contribution of the introduced fish to year-class abundance, biomass and production was calculated. The 1971 introduction augmented the year-class by 38% but this brood provided only 1.3% of the total catch during the Sept. 1974 to Aug. 1975 period. In contrast, the 1972 introductions formed 99% of the year-class and contributed 37.8% of the total catch in the same 1974-75 period. The fingerling introduction formed only 7.0% of the 1972 year-class abundance in 1975. Introduced fish provided 54% of the total walleye production of 260 kg (wet weight) during the period Sept. 15, 1974 to Aug. 8, 1975. Production by introduced fish was apportioned as follows: 1972 fry 91%; 1972 fingerlings 7.4%; 1971 fry 1.7%. Introduced walleye fry may make an important contribution to production and the utility of isozyme tagging in the evaluation of fish introductions.																									1977	34	11					2142	2150																WOS:A1977EB57200014

Persistent Patterns of E. coli Concentrations in Two Irrigation Ponds from 3 Years of Monitoring	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Small to medium irrigation ponds provide substantial quantities of water for irrigation in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. The concentrations of the fecal indicator organism Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used to evaluate the microbial water quality of irrigation sources. Little is known about the spatiotemporal variability of E. coli concentrations in pond water and the possible effects on monitoring and management of the microbial quality of irrigation water from these ponds. The objective of this work was to test the hypotheses that (a) spatial patterns of E. coli concentrations exist that are preserved both intra- and interannually, and (b) persistent spatial patterns in water quality parameters exist and correlate with persistent patterns of E. coli concentrations. Sampling was conducted fortnightly during the summer months in 2016 to 2018 and consisted of taking water quality measurements at 23 and 34 locations in ponds P1 and P2, respectively. Interannual variability of E. coli was observed in both ponds as was substantial spatial variability of E. coli concentrations within each year. The mean relative difference (MRD) analysis was used to identify temporally stable patterns of E. coli concentrations within the ponds. These patterns found for individual years showed significant positive correlations with each other and with the overall pattern derived from the 3-year dataset. Correlation coefficients of patterns varied from 0.487 to 0.842 in P1 and from 0.467 to 0.789 in P2 (p < 0.05). MRD patterns of water quality parameters and of E. coli concentrations were also significantly correlated. Within the 3-year dataset, the highest positive correlations were observed for chlorophyll-a and turbidity while the dissolved oxygen concentrations demonstrated the greatest negative correlations. Results of the present study emphasize the advisability and feasibility of finding temporally stable spatial patterns in microbial water quality within irrigation ponds.					; Kim, Myungshin/AAP-9262-2020; Morgan, Billie/GXG-7269-2022; Stocker, Matthew/KIG-0922-2024; Pachepsky, Yakov/H-7236-2019	smith, jaclyn/0000-0002-9203-7745; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2021	232	12							492	10.1007/s11270-021-05438-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05438-z													WOS:000723659600002

Climate change studies indicate that the environment in such areas will steadily deteriorate with global warming; inland lakes will shrink and desert areas will expand. Mongolia is a landlocked country in north-central Asia that contains a unique ecological system consisting of taiga, steppe, and desert from north to south. The Selenge River basin (280000 km(2)) in northern Mongolia is a semi-arid region underlain by permafrost, between latitudes 46 and 52degreesN, and longitudes 96 and 109degreesE. The issue of sustainable development of the basin is very important owing to its limited natural resources, including fresh water, forest, and rangeland. To examine the water cycle processes in the basin, a hydrological analysis was carried out using a simple scheme for the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere (big-leaf model) coupled to a hydrological model for the period 1988-92 to estimate the hydrological regime of the basin. Annual precipitation in this period averaged 298 mm, ranging from 212 to 352 mm at a 1degrees x 1degrees resolution based on data from 10 gauges, and the estimated annual evapotranspiration averaged 241 turn, ranging between 153 and 300 mm. This indicates that evapotranspiration accounts for the overwhelming majority of the annual precipitation, averaging 81% and ranging between 64 and 96%. The annual potential evapotranspiration in the basin averaged 2009 mm; the ratio of evapotranspiration (actual to potential evapotranspiration) was 0.12 and the wetness index (annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) was 0.15.

The effects of a whole-watershed calcium addition on the chemistry of stream storm events at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in NH, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Patterns of storm runoff chemistry from a wollastonite (calcium-silicate mineral, CaSiO3) treated watershed (W1) were compared with a reference watershed (W6) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire (NH), USA to investigate the role of Ca2+ supply in the acid-base status of stream chemistry. In the summer of 2003, six storm events were studied in W1 and W6 to evaluate the effects of the wollastonite treatment on the episodic acidification of stream waters. Although mean values of Ca2+ concentrations decreased slightly from 33.8 to 31.7 mu mol/L with increasing stream discharge in W1 during the events, the mean value of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was positive (1.2 mu eq/L) during storm events, compared to negative values (-0.2 mu eq/L) in W6. This pattern is presumably due to enhanced Ca2+ supply in W1 (20.7 to 29.0% of dissolved Ca2+ derived from the added wollastonite) to stream water as a result of interflow along shallow flowpaths. In addition, the application of wollastonite increased pH and dissolved silica (H4SiO4) concentrations, and decreased the concentration of inorganic monomeric Al (Al-i) in W1 in comparison with W6 during storm events. Despite an increase in SO42- concentration, likely due to desorption of sulfate from soil after the treatment, the watershed showed an increase in ANC compared to the reference watershed, serving to mitigate episodic acidification.

J	Ahmad, T; Khanna, PP; Chakrapani, GJ; Balakrishnan, S				Ahmad, T; Khanna, PP; Chakrapani, GJ; Balakrishnan, S			Geochemical characteristics of water and sediment of the Indus river, Trans-Himalaya, India: constraints on weathering and erosion	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Indus river carries a huge amount of chemical and sediment load while traversing the Himalayas. The present study deals with the chemistry of major ions (Ca, Mg, HCO3, Na, K, Cl, SO4, SiO2) and trace metal contents (Ba, Sr, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co, Mn) of the river Indus, one of its major tributaries, the river Beas, many adjoining hot and cold water springs and the high altitude lake (similar to 5700 m) Kyung Tso. Although anthropogenic activities like farming, grazing and tourism have started in large parts of this terrain, our study indicates that chemistry of Indus water is influenced mostly by the lithology of the basin and most of its ionic concentration appears to have been derived from weathering of carbonates and silicates in the catchment area. For the first time, bed and suspended sediments of the river Indus have also been studied and compared with average Post Archean shale (PAS) and greywacke. The sediments of the Indus river in its headwater region closely reflect the exposed portion of the crust in its catchment area. The headwater part of the Indus Basin in Ladakh and Karakorum is characterised by rapid uplift and, therefore, subject more to intense physical weathering than chemical weathering, as is evidenced by the suspended and dissolved load carried by the river. Physical weathering and erosion is expected to have major controls on the grain size and therefore the chemical nature of the sediments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, the present study aims to monitor the water quality of Wular Lake by subjecting the acquired datasets to statistical approaches to infer status about distinctions and similarities among different sampling sites under investigation. The study integrated multiple data sets pertaining to analysis and assessment of water quality parameters, physicochemical concentration values, land use change systems, and water quality index through remote sensing and GIS environments. For limnological characterization of the lake, surface water quality data have been collected from seven randomly selected site pertaining to 22 physicochemical parameters, which were further analyzed. Settlements, agriculture, and horticulture in the lake's immediate vicinity were mapped using LISS IV satellite data of the year 2008-2019. The water quality index under this study comprises 12 measurable physicochemical parameters - pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total hardness, calcium content, magnesium content, nitrate nitrogen, chloride, turbidity, potassium, sodium and total alkalinity. Based on WQI values, the whole lake was divided into five zones, comprising least polluted zone (<50), moderately polluted zone (50-100), highly polluted zone (100-200), very highly polluted zone (200-300) and extremely polluted zone (>300). From this study, it has been found that WQI values for site S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7 are 179.62, 149.8, 160.61, 205.21, 200.5, 164.95 and 183.74, respectively. Thus, revealing that site S4 and S5 fall under the 'very highly polluted zone' and the remaining sites S1, S2, S3, S6 and S7 under 'highly polluted zone'. Land use category settlement record a growth rate of +50.79%, horticulture +25.96%, agriculture -11.8% and water body (open waters) -24.3% from the year 2008-2019. The reckless use of fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides in orchards and agricultural farms reinforced by concrete jungles in the immediate vicinity of Wular Lake have also enhanced the nutrient enrichment and deterioration of the water quality. Thus, escalating its scope towards the process of eutrophication.					; Ali, Mohammad/C-6771-2012; Ahmad, Wani/ABC-8198-2020	, Md Babor Ali/0000-0001-9366-847X; AHMAD, WANI SUHAIL/0000-0003-2861-0532; 													0149-0419	1521-060X				JUL 4	2022	45	4					407	434		10.1080/01490419.2022.2034686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490419.2022.2034686		FEB 2022											WOS:000766125800001

Observations on the terrestrial leech Haemopis septagon Sawyer & Shelley, 1976 (Annelida: Hirudinea) from the Outer Banks, North Carolina, USA, with a revision of the species	ZOOTAXA												The terrestrial leech Haemopis septagon Sawyer & Shelley,1976, is indigenous to the Great Dismal Swamp and environs of northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, USA. Ever since its discovery in 1895 at Lake Drummond in the Dismal Swamp, this elusive species has been recognized as taxonomically aberrant. For example, it is the only jawed leech in the United States with seven annuli between gonopores, and the only one with sixteen complete (5-annulate) segments, both highly conserved characters in the Hirudinidae. The discovery of two populations of H. septagon in the Albemarle Peninsula in the Outer Banks region of North Carolina afforded an opportunity to investigate the taxonomy and biology of this inadequately characterized species. Its description in this study is the first comprehensive account of the external and internal anatomy of this species since its incomplete original description in 1976. This study is also an opportunity to correct errors in the incomplete original description, and to elucidate morphological and developmental variability of taxonomic significance. Evidence is presented for the first time of a possible aquatic or semi-aquatic form of H. septagon. These Albemarle individuals were compared to the holotype from Durham County, NC, specimens from southeastern Virginia and a terrestrial leech recently reported from southern New Jersey. All of these fall within the variability demonstrated in this study for the Albemarle populations, and are accordingly recognized as the same species, H. septagon. Consequentially, Haemopis ottorum Wirchansky & Shain, 2010, is recognized as a junior synonym of Haemopis septagon.																			1175-5326	1175-5334				AUG 22	2019	4658	2					275	296		10.11646/zootaxa.4658.2.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4658.2.4								31716744					WOS:000482550000004

Threatened habitat at Great Salt Lake: Importance of shallow-water and brackish habitats to Wilson's and Red-necked phalaropes	CONDOR												Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the largest hypersaline lake in North America and is the fall staging area for a high proportion of North America's Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) and Red-necked Phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus). Unfortunately, diversion of freshwater for agriculture and development has decreased the size of GSL by 48%.To assess the potential impact of a smaller GSL on phalaropes, we collected data from 2013 to 2015 from sites where large, dense flocks of phalaropes congregated and sites where there were no phalaropes. At each site, we measured the densities of invertebrates that were preyed upon by phalaropes, including larval and adult brine flies (Ephydridae), adult brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), chironomid larvae (Chironomidae), and corixid adults (Corixidae). Abiotic characteristics measured included water depth, water salinity, water temperature, wind speed, and benthic substrate. We analyzed high-salinity sites separately from low-salinity sites because they contained different invertebrates. High-salinity sites were in Carrington and Gilbert bays and were relatively deep (mostly <2 m). At the high-salinity sites, phalaropes exhibited a preference for sites with an abundance of adult brine flies and for microbialite substrates. The low-salinity sites were in Ogden and Farmington bays and were shallow (<1 m). At low-salinity sites, large phalaropeflocks were more likely to occur at sites that were shallower, less saline, and had a high biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates. Our results indicate that physical features and prey availability are both important in determining phalarope habitat use at GSL. Phalaropes prefer to use shallower parts of GSL and brackish waters. These areas will be especially impacted by decreased freshwater inflow into GSL.

Depensatory Mortality, Density-Dependent Growth, and Delayed Compensation: Disentangling the Interplay of Mortality, Growth, and Density during Early Life Stages of Yellow Perch	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We present long-term (>40-year) patterns in the density of age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens in Oneida Lake at four early life stages (at egg deposition, at the attainment of a total length of 18 mm. on I August, and on 15 October), front which we calculated mortality and growth rates during the three intervals between these early life stages. At each of these stages. age-0 yellow perch densities have been lower in recent years than in the 1960s and 1970s. Mortality rates showed no time trend front egg to 18 nun (interval I [the larval stage]), increased from 18 turn to I August (interval 2 [the limnetic stage]), and decreased front I August to 15 October (interval 3 [the demersal stage]). We also tested previous hypotheses for density-dependent effects on mortality and growth using the entire long-term data set, Contrary to expectations from the 1960s, the mortality rates of age-0 yellow perch in Oneida Lake are no longer depensatory. Overall, the growth rate of age-0 yellow perch has increased over time and become density dependent. Also contrary to common expectations of size-selective mortality, greater average total length is not associated with decreased instantaneous daily mortality fer two early life stage intervals. The combined effect has been a decline in age-0 yellow perch density and in increase in average total length by the end of their first year. Although increased growth has not sufficiently compensated for increased mortality during the first year of life, obtaining a larger end-of-year size should reduce subsequent mortality during the winter period, providing for it process of delayed compensation that helps stabilize density at age 1.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2009	138	1					99	110		10.1577/T07-256.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-256.1													WOS:000268500900009

Optimal temperature for A. ovalisporum growth was 26-30 degreesC, resulting in growth rates of 0.2-0.3 day(-1), similar to those observed in the lake. Maximal rate of CO, fixation (assimilation numbers of 6-8 mug C mug(-1) Chl h(-1)) was obtained at low irradiances (I-k of 40-100 mumol photons m(-1) s(-1)), 200 muM Pi and low N : Pi ratios. Growth was strongly affected by phosphorus availability, reaching a maximum at Pi concentrations above 40 muM. The high demand for phosphorus was indicated by an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. The relative abundance of Pi in the cells increased by 4-fold in Pi-rich compared with Pi-limited cultures. Uptake of Pi was faster in Pi-depleted compared with Pi-sufficient cells. Maximal photosynthetic rates and K-1/2(HCO3-) were 140-220 mumol O-2 mg(-1) Chl h(-1) and 10-24 muM. respectively. At pH 7(.)0 the K-1/2(CO2) was 2(.)2 and fell to 0-04 muM at pH 9(.)0. These data indicated that A. ovalisporum is a HCO3- user, and can explain its high photosynthetic rates during the bloom, under high pH and low dissolved CO., conditions. Na+ concentrations of about 5 mM were essential for A. ovalisporum growth at high pH approaching values in the lake.					; Kaplan, Aaron/GLN-5655-2022	Kaplan, Aaron/0000-0002-0815-5731; 													0967-0262	1469-4433				MAY	2002	37	2					259	267		10.1017/S0967026202003645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0967026202003645													WOS:000175696400012

C.; Potter-Witter, Karen; Blinn, Charles R.; Rickenbach, Mark			The Logging Sector in the Lake States of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin: Status, Issues, and Opportunities	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY												Coordinated mail surveys of logging businesses in the Lake States of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin were conducted in spring 2017 to assess the status and capacity of the sector in 2016. Many similarities among logging businesses were noted across the region. Despite the presence of many small logging businesses, much of the volume (58 percent) is produced by a few large producers (13 percent) who seem to have an advantage over their smaller counterparts. Businesses and business owners are aging (average business duration, 27 years and average owner age, 54 years), and the majority are producing below their full operational capacity and achieving break-even profit levels. About one-fourth of the businesses intend to exit the market in the next 5 years, and there is a lack of factors attracting new workforce members into business. Differences exist among states in terms of harvesting systems used, source and method of timber procurement, and transportation strategy adopted. Study Implications: A better understanding about the situation of logging businesses among policymakers, foresters, landowners, and the forest products industry is essential to help sustain and strengthen this sector in the future. Our results reveal that few large logging businesses produce a major share of the volume harvested in the Lake States region. This trend is expected to continue as many small businesses struggle to compete with large producers and intend to exit from the market in near future. The absence of small logging businesses may have an impact on forest management in small nonindustrial private forests, which are predominantly harvested by such producers. Logging business owners across the region are aging and approaching their retirement age. This means that significant business turnover is likely to take place in the future. Efforts should, therefore, be made to get the next generation ready for business. This can be done by aiding current business owners in their successional planning and business transition decisions, offering training programs to get new business owners ready for business, and looking for ways of diversifying the pool of logging workforce. In addition, measures can be taken to improve the operational capacity and efficiency of current logging businesses so that they can operate profitably and continue to remain in business.

J	Cooperman, M; Markle, DF				Cooperman, M; Markle, DF			Rapid out-migration of lost river and shortnose sucker larvae from in-river spawning beds to in-lake rearing grounds	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined the process of larval out-migration of endangered Lost River suckers Deltistes luxatus and shortnose suckers Chasmistes brevirostris from spawning grounds in the Williamson and Sprague rivers to rearing grounds in Upper Klamath Lake. Most downstream movement occurred at night, when larvae drifted in surface currents at the center of the channel. During daylight, larvae were absent from the drift and abundant near the periphery of the wetted channel, in areas that lacked current. The ages, sizes, and developmental stages of larvae from spawning grounds and the river mouth were similar, indicating that larval suckers transit from spawning grounds to the lake as soon as I d after the beginning of the larval period and that in-river rearing is rare. The percent of larvae with empty guts declined from upriver towards the river mouth, suggesting that first feeding is an important driver of the out-migration process. Sucker larvae greater than 13.99 mm standard length were rare in the rivers but abundant in the lake, suggesting out-migration to Upper Klamath Lake is advantageous. Warmer temperatures and greater food availability may be important attributes of lake nursery grounds that are not found in the river. Most larvae entered the system on the falling river hydrograph, a strategy that does not promote floodplain access. Also, larvae of related species do not use floodplains. Therefore, suggestions that channelization and dredging of the lower Williamson River and severance of river-floodplain connectivity by levee construction have negatively affected larval suckers by slowing the out-migration process or eliminating preferred habitats were not supported.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2003	132	6					1138	1153		10.1577/T02-130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T02-130													WOS:000186618100009

The laminae were identified as varves by a numerical analysis of diatom counts in the thin-sections, The hypothesis of two diatom blooms per year was corroborated by the Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology. A period of intensive pasturing during the 'Little Ice Age' between AD 1346 and AD 1595 is suggested by coprophilous fungal spores, as well as by pollen indicators of grazing, by the diatom-inferred total phosphorus. by geochemistry and by documentary data. The subsequent re-oligotrophication of the lake took about 88 years, as determined by the timelag between the decline of coprophile fungal spores and the restoration of pre-eutrophic nutrient conditions, According to previous studies of latewood densities from the same region, cold summers around AD 1600 limited the pasturing at this altitude. This demonstrated the socio-economic impact of a single climatic event. However, the variance partitioning between the effects of land use and climate, which was applied for the whole core, revealed that climate independent of land use and time explained only 1.32% of the diatom data, while land use independent of climate and time explained 15.7%. Clearly land use influenced the take, but land use was not always driven by climate. Other factors beside climate, such as politics or the introduction of fertilizers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also influenced the development of Alpine pasturing.

J	Tugend, KI; Allen, MS				Tugend, KI; Allen, MS			Changes in the plant and fish communities in enhanced littoral areas of Lake Kissimmee, florida, following a habitat enhancement	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A 1995-96 habitat enhancement project was conducted at Lake Kissimmee, Florida, which included a major drawdown and organic sediment removal from about half of the lake's shoreline. Previous studies have compared enhanced versus control sites following habitat enhancements, but no studies have assessed how plant and fish communities change through time in enhanced habitats. We sampled plant and fish communities in two enhanced littoral areas three times each summer from 1998 to 2000. Quality fish habitat (i.e., sandy bottom, moderate coverage of aquatic macrophytes, high dissolved oxygen concentrations) was present in enhanced sites throughout this study. Irrespective of water level, plant abundance (percent area covered, PAC) and biomass increased during the study period, but mean plant biomass and abundance were < 2 kg (.) m(-2) and < 50%, respectively, in 2000. Mean dissolved oxygen concentrations in enhanced sites generally exceeded 3 mg(.)L(-1) in all years. Diverse fish communities also reflected quality habitat in enhanced sites. No fish variables differed between sites, but fish diversity and richness were highest during 1999 when water levels were high. Mean water depth and PAC, when significant, were positively related to fish variables (e.g., biomass, diversity). The results of this study suggest that the benefits of the 1995-96 Lake Kissimmee habitat enhancement were prolonged compared to a previous effort, which may be due, in part, to herbicide treatments.

Eight sediment cores were analysed. The total Pb-210 content was measured with Po-210 using alpha spectrometry, and the supported Pb-210 (Ra-226) and Cs-137 were measured by gamma spectrometry. The age depth model was derived by applying the Pb-210 dating method, and for the calculation of the ages and the sedimentation rates the CRS model was used. The sedimentation rates can be divided into four periods: 1940-1972, 1972-1980, 1972-1989 and 1989-2013. In the case of Lake Iacob in the first period, the average sedimentation rate was 0.418 g/cm(2)y, while in the second it slowly decreased to 0.376 g/cm(2)y. In the third period, the sedimentation fell to 0.209 g/cm(2)y, which means the retention of 27.3% of the sediment by the IG dam. In the case of Lake Isac the changes were more visible: in the first period the average sedimentation rate was 0.446 g/cm(2)y, while in the second it decreased to 0.197 g/cm(2)y, which means a 42.35% retention of sediment. In the last period, in both cases, a high increase in the sedimentation rate is shown: 0.677 g/cm(2)y for Lake Iacob and 0.715 g/cm(2)y for Lake Isac. The heavy-metal concentrations for As, Co, Cr and Ni show decreasing and Hg increasing tendencies, while Cd and Pb show constant values of 310 +/- 12 ppb and 9 +/- 1 ppm respectively.

J	Griffiths, D				Griffiths, David			Effects of climatic change and eutrophication on the glacial relict, Mysis relicta, in Lough Neagh	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The glacial relict, Mysis relicta, which occurs mainly in unproductive cold water habitats, shows increased mortality rates in temperatures above 16-18 degrees C. Using a 12-year data set the growth, mortality and fat stores of Mysis in Lough Neagh, an increasingly hypertrophic lake which lacks a thermal refuge and which is subject to warming, were investigated. 2. Mysis showed a significant reduction in fat stores on reaching sexual maturity, contrary to studies elsewhere. 3. The contributions of temperature and eutrophication (total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a concentrations) to growth, mortality and the timing and duration of developmental events were investigated by regression. 4. Water temperatures rose between 1994 and 2005 and the time when temperatures exceeded 16 degrees C doubled over this period. Juvenile and adult growth rates declined and the duration of the juvenile stage increased in warmer years. Eutrophication also affected these variables but, in general, to a lesser extent than temperature. 5. Year class strength (YCS) declined by a factor of 10 over the study period. YCS was independent of temperature up to 2000 degrees C degree days (> 4 degrees C) but declined steeply above that point. Temperature was more important than eutrophication in predicting mortality and YCS. YCS was positively correlated with the length of time water temperature was below 7 degrees C, the upper temperature for Mysis breeding. 6. An established bioenergetic model predicted that water temperature and the timing of embryo release would have appreciable effects on Mysis viability. It also indicated that Mysis would lose mass at summer temperatures, consistent with the observed fat decline.																			0046-5070					OCT	2007	52	10					1957	1967		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01824.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01824.x													WOS:000249276200008

Here C. passerinum occurs in sand dune complexes in a wide variety of habitats ranging from open grass-covered dunes to stabilized dunes with Picea glauca forest. Details of morphology, phenology, growth, reproduction and habitat are presented for the 52 groups of plants (899 plants) found. C. passerinum begins to flower in mid-June and immature capsules can be found in early July. Flower mortality was caused by insect damage (1%) and an unknown agent (12%). High capsule set in undamaged flowers (99%) suggested autogamy was occurring and experimental pollination studies supported this. Seed dispersal is not synchronized in any manner, both dehisced and undehisced capsules of the previous year were found in July. C. passerinum may take approximately 15 yr to flower from seed. Four species from 3 insect orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera) fed on C. passerinum. Examination of 42 groups of flowering plants showed that only 5 contained seedlings and that within-group recruitment was largely the result of vegetative reproduction alone. Seedlings were found only in early successional habitats within the dune complex. The habitat occupied by C. passerinum is a changing environment mosaic, and this has important implications for species management.																			0008-3550						1983	97	3					268	274																WOS:A1983SJ17600003
J	Bell, ME; Conover, MR				Bell, Mark E.; Conover, Michael R.			Nest success of ground-nesting ducks in the wetlands of Great Salt Lake, Utah	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The number of ground-nesting ducks in the wetlands of Great Salt Lake, Utah has drastically decreased in the past few decades. A potential cause for this decline is the increase of predator species and their abundances, which has caused most nests to fail from depredation. Ground-nesting ducks may be able to reduce the risk of nest depredation by selecting nest sites where local physical structures or vegetation provides olfactory or visual concealment. To test this, we used logistic exposure models to look at the effect of nest-site characteristics on daily survival rates (DSRs) of nests during 2019, 2020, and 2021 in the wetlands of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We found 825 duck nests including 458 cinnamon teal (Spatula cyanoptera), 166 mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos), and 201 gadwalls (Mareca strepera). DSRs were 0.9714 +/- 0.0019 in 2019, 0.9282 +/- 0.0049 in 2020, and 0.8274 +/- 0.0185 in 2021. Survival rates varied among years but not among duck species. Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) were responsible for 85% of depredated nests. Nests located near other duck nests had higher DSRs than more dispersed nests. Neither visual nor olfactory characteristics correlated with increased DSRs based on AICc analysis. Nests located inside a mixed nesting colony of American avocets (Recurvirostra americana), black-necked stilts (Himantopus mexicanus), and common terns (Sterna hirundo) had higher DSRs than duck nests outside the colony. Increased nesting densities of ducks and other colonial waterbirds had the greatest impact on nesting success. Increased nest density may be encouraged through early spring green-up.					; Bell, Mark/LLK-4894-2024	Bell, Mark/0000-0003-0746-3123; 													2045-7758					AUG	2023	13	8							e10384	10.1002/ece3.10384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10384								37529591					WOS:001038854800001

Selenium uptake and trophic transfer at the base of aquatic food chains represent a great source of uncertainty for Se risk assessment. The goal of the present study was to investigate Se distribution in water and sediment and its subsequent transfer into the periphyton-benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) food chain in boreal lakes downstream from a Saskatchewan uranium mill. In particular, the present study aimed to assess potential differences in Se bioaccumulation patterns by BMI taxa to contribute to the current knowledge gap. During summer 2018 and 2019, water, sediment, periphyton, and BMI were sampled at two sites in Vulture Lake, seven sites in McClean Lake east basin, and one reference site in McClean Lake west basin. Periphyton and BMI taxa were sampled with artificial substrates (Hester-Dendy) deployed for 5 weeks in 2018 and 7 weeks in 2019; BMI were sorted into the lowest practical achievable taxonomic level and analyzed for total Se concentrations. At the diluted effluent exposure sites, Se concentrations in BMI ranged from 1.3 to 18.0 mu g/g dry weight and from 0.3 to 49.3 mu g/g dry weight in 2018 and 2019, respectively, whereas concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 3.5 mu g/g dry weight at the reference site. Selenium concentrations in periphyton and some BMI taxa sampled near the effluent diffuser (Se < 1 mu g/L) reached levels comparable to higher effluent exposure sites (Se > 2 mu g/L). Despite differences in Se bioaccumulation among BMI taxa, an approximately one-to-one trophic transfer ratio was observed for benthic primary consumers and benthic predatory taxa.

J	Lewis, HW; Dadson, SJ				Lewis, Huw W.; Dadson, Simon J.			A regional coupled approach to water cycle prediction during winter 2013/14 in the United Kingdom	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A regional coupled approach to water cycle prediction is demonstrated for the 4-month period from November 2013 to February 2014. This provides the first multi-component analysis of precipitation, soil moisture, river flow and coastal ocean simulations produced by an atmosphere-land-ocean coupled system focussed on the United Kingdom (UK), running with horizontal grid spacing of around 1.5 km across all components. The Unified Model atmosphere component, in which convection is explicitly simulated, reproduces the observed UK rainfall accumulation (r(2) of 0.95 for water day accumulation), but there is a notable bias in its spatial distribution-too dry over western upland areas and too wet further east. The JULES land surface model soil moisture state is shown to be in broad agreement with a limited number of cosmic-ray neutron probe observations. A comparison of observed and simulated river flow shows the coupled system is useful for predicting broad scale features, such as distinguishing high and low flow regions and times during the period of interest but are less accurate than optimized hydrological models. The impact of simulated river discharge on NEMO model simulations of coastal ocean state is explored in the coupled modelling framework, with comparisons provided relative to experiments using climatological river input and no river input around the UK coasts. Results show that the freshwater flux around the UK contributes of order 0.2 psu to the mean surface salinity, and comparisons to profile observations give evidence of an improved vertical structure when applying simulated flows. This study represents the first assessment of the coupled system performance from a hydrological perspective, with priorities for future model developments and challenges for evaluation of such systems discussed.

Rainbow smelt population responses to species invasions and change in environmental condition	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive species can cause major disruptions in native food webs, yet the impact of species introductions and whether they will become invasive appears to be context-dependent. Rainbow smelt and alewife coexist as invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes and as native species on the Atlantic coast of North America, but in Lake Champlain rainbow smelt is the dominant native forage fish and alewife are invasive. Alewife became abundant by 2007, providing an opportunity to explore the dynamics of these two species in a system where only one is invasive. We used data from a 28-year forage fish survey to compare demographics of rainbow smelt populations in three basins of Lake Champlain with different volumes, nutrient levels, and predator abundances. Rainbow smelt catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) remained constant in the large, deep Main Lake before and after alewife invaded, but decreased in the two smaller basins. Declines were primarily a result of increased age-0 and age-1 mortality. Predation by top piscivores, system productivity, and competition for resources alone could not explain the patterns in CPUE across the basins. The mechanisms that allow alewife and rainbow smelt to co-exist could be related to system volume and oxythermal habitat availability, and may explain why the two species do not negatively affect each other in the Great Lakes. Summer hypoxia in the smaller basins could force individuals into smaller habitat volumes with higher densities of competitors and cannibalistic adult rainbow smelt. Habitat availability may mediate the impact of invasive alewife on native rainbow smelt. (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Fierstein, J; Hildreth, W				Fierstein, Judy; Hildreth, Wes			Kaguyak dome field and its Holocene caldera, Alaska Peninsula	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Kaguyak Caldera lies in a remote corner of Katmai National Park, 375 km SW of Anchorage, Alaska. The 2.5-by-3-km caldera collapsed similar to 5.8 +/- 0.2 ka (C-14 age) during emplacement of a radial apron of poorly pumiceous crystal-rich dacitic pyroclastic flows (61-67% SiO2). Proximal pumice-fall deposits are thin and sparsely preserved, but an oxidized coignimbrite ash is found as far as the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, 80 km southwest. Postcaldera events include filling the 150-m-deep caldera lake, emplacement of two intracaldera domes (61.5-64.5% SiO2), and phreatic ejection of lakefloor sediments onto the caldera rim. CO2 and H2S bubble up through the lake, weakly but widely. Geochemical analyses (n=148), including pre-and post-caldera lavas (53-74% SiO2), define one of the lowest-K arc suites in Alaska. The precaldera edifice was not a stratocone but was, instead, nine contiguous but discrete clusters of lava domes, themselves stacks of rhyolite to basalt exogenous lobes and flows. Four extracaldera clusters are mid-to-late Pleistocene, but the other five are younger than 60 ka, were truncated by the collapse, and now make up the steep inner walls. The climactic ignimbrite was preceded by similar to 200 years by radial emplacement of a 100-m-thick sheet of block-rich glassy lava breccia (62-65.5% SiO2). Filling the notches between the truncated dome clusters, the breccia now makes up three segments of the steep caldera wall, which beheads gullies incised into the breccia deposit prior to caldera formation. They were probably shed by a large lava dome extruding where the lake is today.

This study extensively explored the geochemical features and distribution tendencies of source rocks in the Chang 7 member, utilizing core samples and logging data for a comprehensive analysis. A more advanced model was utilized to predict the dispersion of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the Chang 7 member source rock. The properties and hydrocarbon generation potential of source rocks were thoroughly assessed through a comprehensive analysis that involved evaluating their total organic carbon content, pyrolysis parameters, and reflectance (Ro) values. The research concluded that the source rocks boast substantial organic matter, predominantly categorized as type II-I organic material. The thermal maturation levels span from low maturity to maturity, signifying significant potential for oil generation. Generally, the source rock quality falls within the range of good to excellent. Sedimentary patterns notably influence the distribution of hydrocarbon-source rocks. The northeastern sector of the study area is situated in an area characterized by deep to semi-deep lake sedimentation, making it the primary location for the presence of Chang 7 member hydrocarbon source rocks. With a thickness ranging from 40 to 70 m, this zone becomes a pivotal focus for the potential exploration of tight oil resources in the future. The results of this study offer crucial insights for understanding the geochemical characteristics of hydrocarbon source rocks, evaluating their potential for hydrocarbon generation, and forecasting favorable zones for oil and gas exploration in similar regions.

SG14 Project Members	Refining the eruptive history of Ulleungdo and Changbaishan volcanoes (East Asia) over the last 86 kyrs using distal sedimentary records	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The eruptive histories of Ulleungdo (South Korea) and Changbaishan (North Korea/China border) volcanoes are not well constrained since their proximal stratigraphies are poorly exposed or largely inaccessible. However, determining the past behaviour of these volcanoes is critical since future eruptions are likely to disperse ash over some of the world's largest metropolitan regions. Alkaline tephra deposits erupted from both centres are routinely identified in marine cores extracted from the Sea of Japan, as well as high-resolution lacustrine records east of the volcanoes. Here, we review the distal ash occurrences derived from Ulleungdo and Changbaishan and provide new data from the Lake Suigetsu (central Honshu, Japan) sediment core, in order to provide a more complete and constrained eruption framework. The intensely-dated Lake Suigetsu archive provides one of the most comprehensive distal eruption records for both centres, despite being located ca. 500 km E of Ulleungdo and ca. 1000 km SSE of Changbaishan. The Suigetsu record is utilised to precisely date and geochemically fingerprint (using major, minor and trace element glass compositions) ash fall events that reached central Honshu. Here, we identify a new non-visible (cryptotephra) layer in the Suigetsu sediments, which reveals a previously unreported explosive event from Changbaishan at 42,750 - 42,323 IntCal13 yrs BP (95.4 % confidence interval). This event is chronologically and geochemically distinct from the B-J (Baegdusan-Japan Basin) tephra reported in the Sea of Japan (ca. 50 ka). Furthermore, we also confirm that the widespread U-Ym tephra erupted from Ulleungdo reached central Japan, and is herein dated to 40,332 39,816 IntCal13 yrs BP (95.4 % confidence interval). This terrestrial C-14-derived age of the U-Ym can be used to constrain the chronology of marine records containing the same marker layer. This reviewed and integrated tephrostratigraphic framework highlights the pivotal role that distal sedimentary records can play in evaluating the eruptive histories and hazard potential of Ulleungdo and Changbaishan.

Regional differences in lake characteristics and species-specific element fractionation, however, do not permit generalization of results from other regions or ostracod species to the southern Tibetan Plateau, in part because most common taxa from the southern Tibetan Plateau are endemic to the area. This study evaluated relations between present-day environmental conditions and the geochemical composition of modern ostracod shells from the southern Tibetan Plateau, to assess the suitability of using shell chemistry to infer hydrological conditions. We studied nine lakes and their catchments, located along a west-east transect in the south-central part of the Tibetan Plateau. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope values and trace element concentrations in recent shells from the four most abundant ostracod species (Leucocytherella sinensis, ?Leucocythere dorsotuberosa, Limnocythere inopinata, Tonnacypris gyirongensis) were measured, together with hydrochemical properties of host waters at the time of sampling. Results revealed significant between-species differences in stable isotope fractionation and trace element incorporation into shell calcite. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope values of ostracod shells were correlated significantly with the stable isotope composition of the respective water body , reflecting salinity and productivity, respectively. Offsets between delta O-18(shell) and delta C-13(shell) and inorganic calcite, the latter representing isotopic equilibrium, suggest shell formation of T. gyirongensis during spring melt. L. sinensis reproduces throughout the monsoon season until September and shows several consecutive generations, and L. inopinata molts to the adult stage after the monsoon season in August/September. The influence of pore water delta C-13 was displayed by L. inopinata, suggesting shell calcification within the sediment. Mg/Ca-shell is primarily influenced by water Mg/Ca ratios and salinity and confirms the use of this shell ratio as a proxy for precipitation-evaporation balance and lake level. In addition, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca can be used to infer changes in salinity, at least in closed-basin lakes with calcite saturation. Observed effects of water Sr/Ca and salinity on Sr/Ca incorporation are biased by the presence of aragonite precipitation in the lakes, which removes bioavailable Sr from the host water, resulting in low Sr/Ca-shell values. Changes in carbonate mineralogy affect the bioavailability of trace elements, a process that should be considered in paleoclimate reconstructions. Oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca-shell ratios were unaffected by water temperature. Positive correlations among Fe/Ca, Mn/Ca and U/Ca in ostracod shells, and their negative correlation with delta C-13, which reflects organic matter decay, show the potential to infer changes in redox conditions that can be used to reconstruct past oxygen supply to bottom waters and thus past water-circulation changes within lakes. The intensity of microbial activity, associated with organic matter decomposition, can be inferred from U/Ca ratios in ostracod shells. These findings highlight the value of fossil ostracod records in lake deposits for inferring paleoenvironmental conditions on the southern Tibetan Plateau.

The Energetics of Encephalization in Early Hominids	EVOLUTION OF HOMININ DIETS: INTEGRATING APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF PALAEOLITHIC SUBSISTENCE	Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology				Symposium on the Evolution of Hominid Diets	MAY 17-21, 2006	Max Planck Inst Evolut Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, Leipzig, GERMANY		Max Planck Inst Evolut Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut			Bioenergetics, the study of the use and transfer of energy, can provide important insights into the ecology and evolution of early hominids. Despite a relatively large brain with high metabolic demands, contemporary humans and other primates have resting metabolic rates (RMRs) that are similar to those of other mammals. As a result, a comparatively large proportion of their resting energy budget is spent on brain metabolism among humans (similar to 20-25%) and other primates (similar to 8-10%) compared to other mammals (similar to 3-5%). To understand this shift in energy budget, Aiello and Wheeler's Expensive Tissue Hypothesis (ETH) posits a metabolic trade-off - a reduction in gut size with brain size increase - to explain this phenomenon. Here, we explore the interrelationships between brain size, body size, diet, and body composition using comparative data for humans, non-human primates, and other mammals. Among living primates, the relative proportion of energy allocated to brain metabolism is positively correlated with dietary quality. Contemporary humans fall at the positive end of this relationship, having both a high quality diet and a large brain. Thus, high costs associated with the large human brain are supported, in part, by energy-rich diets. Although contemporary humans display relatively small guts, primates as a group have gut sizes that are similar to non-primate mammals. In contrast, humans and other primates have significantly less skeletal muscle for their size compared to other mammals. These comparative analyses suggest that alterations in diet quality and body composition were necessary conditions for overcoming the constraints on encephalization. Fossil evidence indicates that brain expansion with the emergence of Homo erectus at about 1.8 million years ago was likely associated with important changes in diet, body composition, and body size.

J	Qi, S; Ren, XM; Dang, XH; Meng, ZJ				Qi, Shuai; Ren, Xiaomeng; Dang, Xiaohong; Meng, Zhongju			Mechanisms of dust emissions from lakes during different drying stages in a semi-arid grassland in northern China	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Semi-arid playas are important to grassland ecosystem species as an important source of global dust emissions. However, there is a lack of data on dust emissions during the different drying stages of grassland playas. In this study, we initially conducted the field experiments on two types of surfaces (intermittently dried and permanently dried) in playas located in semi-arid regions in northern China, and we measured dust emissions at five wind speeds in spring when wind erosion was frequent. The results showed that the intermittently dried surface was more prone to wind erosion, which was primarily due to the formation of a loose and fragile salt crust on the surface. In addition, the proportion of salt in the dust was higher than that for the permanently dried surfaces. Nevertheless, the total horizontal dust flux (1.13-2.3 g/cm(2).min) from the intermittently dried surface was only 5%-15% that of the permanently dried surface (7.47-42.86 g/cm(2).min). The dust content varied linearly with the height of the intermittently dried surface, and varied exponentially with the height of the permanently dried surface. The particles collected on the intermittently dried surface were larger (< 63 mu m) than those collected on the permanently dried surface (< 10 mu m), and the unit mass concentration of each ion (mainly Na+, Cl-, and SO4 (2-)) in the salt dust was also higher for the intermittently dried surface than for the permanently dried surface. Although salt dust was continuously released from the intermittently dried surface, the total amount released each time was limited. These results indicate that to attenuate the damage of salt dust storms, priority should be given to protecting permanently dried surfaces and reducing the supply of salt dust particles at the surface.																				2296-665X				JAN 6	2023	10								1110679	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1110679	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1110679													WOS:000918270100001

The interpretation of proxy indexes of lacustrine sediments is complex due to the various climatic or/and environmental factors influencing the processes during deposition and after deposition. In this study, the elements and colors of an 11.7-m lacustrine record from Chagan Nur at the southern Mongolian Plateau of northern China were analyzed to constrain the lake environmental changes during the Holocene. The results show that stable elements of Al, Si, K, Ti, Fe, and Rb are more related to surface erosion or/and vegetation coverage, and the variation of Sr is related to the lake-level change in Chagan Nur. The element and color of the lacustrine records show that a small and shallow lake environment occurred at Chagan Nur during 11.7-10.5 ka, the lake level had increased during 10.5-7 ka, and then the lake shrank with strength surface erosion during 7-6.2 ka and from 2 ka to the present. The lake level and surface erosion changes of Chagan Nur have shown a direct response to EASM precipitation changes as reconstructed from the pollen record from the Chagan Nur Lake and other records from northern China.

J	Naselli-Flores, L				Naselli-Flores, L			Phytoplankton assemblages in twenty-one Sicilian reservoirs: relationships between species composition and environmental factors	HYDROBIOLOGIA					11th Workshop of the International-Association-of-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology (IAP)	AUG 15-23, 1998	SHREWSBURY, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Phytoplankton Taxon & Ecol				Data collected in a limnological survey, carried out between 1987 and 1988 on 21 Sicilian reservoirs of varying trophic state, were ordinated using CANOCO 3.1 to generalise the way in which the structure of phytoplankton assemblage is conditioned by both physical and chemical variables. The results showed that in these man-made lakes, characterised by conspicuous water-level fluctuations, the annual and interannual variability in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton may be strongly influenced by their peculiar hydraulic regimes rather than by nutrient availability. In particular, it was highlighted that, from the early summer, water abstraction often leads to increased circulation and to the deepening of the mixed layer. In this way, an increase of the ratio of mixing depth to euphotic depth is forced, with the result that phytoplankton cells experience longer periods in darkness as they are carried through the mixed layer. Phytoplankton assemblages change in species composition in response to the environmental variation. Both the raising of the trophic state, with an increase in phytoplankton biomass and a decrease in transparency, and the intensified abstraction enhance the role of light availability in promoting the development of specific phytoplankton assemblages adapted to the modified physical environment. Light climate is an important influence on the species structure of the phytoplankton, especially in the higher part of the trophic gradient. In contrast, the influence of nutrients on the structure of the assemblages appears to be higher in the lower part of the trophic spectrum or in those environments characterised by a higher hydrological stability during the year.

In Lake Vattern, relict Arctic char, fourhorn sculpin, smelt and seven species of crustaceans form a deep-water food-web, and interact closely as competitors, predators and prey. Here, we analyzed new and archived data back to the late 1960s in order to understand and relate observed life-history shifts in the smelt population, to concurrent adverse life-history changes observed in the endangered Arctic char population. Smelt growth was sigmoidal and the size frequency distribution dominated by fish up to 110 mm and age 0-4, although smelt occasionally reached 250 mm. Smelt diet shifts as the fish grow, from zooplankton, to Mysis relicta, to piscivory for individuals larger than 150 mm. Recruitment commonly demonstrates regular inter-annual pulses of YOY abundance although strong year classes produced during years with higher spring temperature cause post-annual irregularity of year class strength. Young smelt reside in surface water and older fish in deeper water. This ontogenetic shift in distribution depends on temperature occupied, prey availability and risk of inter- and intra-specific predation. Interestingly, even though very small Arctic char feed on smelt, most small Arctic char are found in deep water together with large smelt, and most large Arctic char are found in shallow water with small smelt.

Trophic status of three large Missouri River reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Probability-based surveys conducted between 2001-2004 characterized the three large reservoirs of the Missouri River-Lake Oahe, Lake Sakakawea, and Fort Peck Lake-as mesotrophic to eutrophic, phosphorus (P) limited, and generally supporting cold water habitat (bottom waters <15 degrees C and dissolved oxygen [ DO] concentrations >5 mg/L) in midsummer. Riverine zones were shallower, warmer, more eutrophic, and had lower DO and higher suspended matter concentrations than lacustrine zones. Similar, although more variable, differences were found between bays and open-water areas. Between sampling years, water levels decreased in each reservoir. In the first year of sampling, area-weighted mean reservoir trophic status index based on chlorophyll (TSI(chl)) was about 37 in all three reservoirs. Sixty percent of Oahe and Sakakawea and 40% of Fort Peck had TSI(chl) >50. Trophic status index based on Secchi depth (TSI(SD)) averaged about 50 in each reservoir across years. Because mean TSI(chl) <TSI(SD), light attenuation was considered to be silt, not algae, dominated. Trophic status index based on total P (TSI(TP)) and the ratio of N:P concentrations indicated that the reservoirs were very P limited. Mean bottom temperature and DO concentration in Oahe were unchanged between years at about 19 degrees C and 7.5 mg/L, respectively. Bottom temperatures in Sakakawea increased (from 15 degrees C to 21 degrees C) and DO concentration decreased (from 7.3 mg/L to 6.0 mg/L) with lower water levels. In Fort Peck, bottom temperature remained about 18 degrees C, but DO concentration fell from 7.23 mg/L to 4.96 mg/L. Results show that surveys successfully characterized important environmental conditions throughout these large reservoirs.																			1040-2381						2009	25	2					176	190		10.1080/07438140902905596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140902905596													WOS:000269667400007

Trends in PCBs and PCDD/Fs were, therefore, assessed in lake sediments of the Grober Arbersee over the past 130 years (1860-1990). Ballschmiter-PCB concentrations (congeners # 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) increased between 1946 and 1972 from 4.2 to 32.O mu g kg(-1) dry wt, but have since decreased to 25.6 mu g kg(-1) dry wt. High chlorinated PCB congeners reached their maxima earlier (1968-1972) than low chlorinated congeners (1985-1991). These trends were consistent with patterns expected from the production and use of PCBs and their precursors. PCDDIF concentrations increased between 1950 from 0.6 mu g kg(-1) dry wt to 2.3 mu g kg(-1) dry wt in 1977, falling to 1.7 mu g kg(-1) dry wt by 1993. PCDF concentrations exceeded those of PCDD until 1968, but afterwards PCDDs (especially OCDD) were predominant. These patterns suggest that domestic heating and waste combustion were the most likely sources, but pollution from local industries, such as metal smelting and glass production, might also have been involved. The data provide a valuable case study from central Europe which confirms the overall declining trends of PCB and PCDDIF contamination shown elsewhere. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Total organic carbon, total lipid, lipid classes, and alkanes were measured in the collected material to gain information on the composition, sources, and fate of particulate organic matter in the Great Lakes. Total aliphatic hydrocarbon was a large component of all samples, accounting for more than 15% of the extractable lipids. Particles collected at 10-m depth in Lake Huron had especially high relative contributions (more than 65% of total lipids) of total aliphatic hydrocarbons at the three stations examined. The high proportion of aliphatic hydrocarbon appears not to have originated from customary pollution sources. The alkane distribution was strongly dominated by even-numbered carbon chains of unknown origin. Algae are a possible source for the unsaturated hydrocarbons that were present at relatively elevated levels in settling particles. Botryococcus braunii, sampled from Lake Michigan had as much as 80% of its lipids in the form of hydrocarbons. Wax and sterol esters constituted less than 10% of the lipids in trap material except in samples from mid-depths in Lake Huron where high levels of these compounds may have resulted from elevated amounts of calanoid copepod debris or swimmers entering the traps.																			0146-6380					JAN	1992	18	1					33	40		10.1016/0146-6380(92)90141-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0146-6380(92)90141-J													WOS:A1992GV74800005

Unfortunately none of these factors are fully understood. Sediment cores from Fenton Lake and other sites in the Lake Superior basin have been used to document constantly falling water levels in glacial Lake Minong between 9,000 and 10,600 cal (8.1-9.5 ka) BP. Over three meters of previously unrecovered sediment from Fenton Lake detail a more complex lake level history than formerly realized, and consists of an early regression, transgression, and final regression. The initial regression is documented by a transition from gray, clayey silt to black sapropelic silt. The transgression is recorded by an abrupt return to gray sand and silt, and dates between 9,000 and 9,500 cal (8.1-8.6 ka) BP. The transgression could be the result of increased discharge from Lake Agassiz overflow or the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and hydraulic damming at the Lake Minong outlet. Alternatively ice advance in northern Ontario may have blocked an unrecognized low level northern outlet to glacial Lake Ojibway, which switched Lake Minong overflow back to the Lake Huron basin and raised lake levels. Multiple sites in the Lake Huron and Michigan basins suggest increased meltwater discharges occurred around the time of the transgression in Lake Minong, suggesting a possible linkage. The final regression in Fenton Lake is documented by a return to black sapropelic silt, which coincides with varve cessation in the Superior basin when Lake Agassiz overflow and glacial meltwater was diverted to glacial Lake Ojibway in northern Ontario.					; Fisher, Timothy/C-2609-2011	Lowell, Thomas/0000-0001-7826-0636; 													0921-2728					MAR	2012	47	3			SI		313	326		10.1007/s10933-010-9447-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9447-z													WOS:000302381900003

The rapid effects of a whole-lake reduction of coarse woody debris on fish and benthic macroinvertebrates	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Ecosystems can enhance the biodiversity of adjacent ecosystems through subsidies of prey, nutrients and also habitat. For example, trees can fall into aquatic ecosystems and act as a subsidy that increases aquatic habitat heterogeneity. This habitat subsidy is vulnerable in lakes where anthropogenic development of shorelines coincides with a thinning of riparian forests and the removal of these dead trees (termed coarse woody debris: CWD). How the disruption of this subsidy affects lake ecosystems is not well understood. 2. We performed a whole ecosystem experiment on Little Rock Lake, a small (18 ha), undeveloped, and unfished lake in Vilas County, WI, U.S.A., that is divided into two similar-sized basins by a double poly-vinyl chloride curtain that prevents both fish and water exchange between basins. In 2002, we removed about 70% of the littoral CWD in the treatment basin, while the reference basin was left unaltered. We tested for changes in both fish and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in the two years following the CWD reduction. 3. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) was the most abundant fish species in the lake prior to our experiment, but declined to very low densities in the treatment basin after manipulation. We found no evidence of an effect on macroinvertebrates - the treatment basin's macroinvertebrate community composition, diversity and density did not change relative to the reference basin. 4. Our results indicate that different trophic groups may have differential responses to the loss of a habitat subsidy, even if anthropogenic effects on that subsidy are severe. In the case of Little Rock Lake, fish community responses were evident on a short-time scale, whereas the macroinvertebrate community did not rapidly change following CWD reduction.

A negative L-value (linear index of selection) applied to predation on nauplii and copepodites by 7 and 8 mm larvae; nevertheless, caloric intake was dominated by copepods in 8-10 mm larvae. Neuston-caught larvae 13-20 mm TL fed selectively on Cladocera, especially Bosmina, and on the rotifer Asplanchna spp. Growth, estimated from otolith ring counts and from analysis of size distribution data, ranged from 3 to 7 mm mo-1, with higher rates for early spawned larvae. When consumption as estimated from gut content, was compared to amounts of food required for growth, it appeared that the smallest larvae were underfed, while 13-16 mm fish obtained rations close to sufficiency. Rotifer standing stock biomass in Lake Kinneret has decreased in recent years, especially in winter, the spawning period of Mirogrex. Postulated causes are predation by an increasingly large population of Mirogrex larvae; and decrease of external supply. Larval distribution appeared to be linked to S. pectinata abundance; highest densities of both organisms occurred in the area of inflow from the Jordan and Golan streams. Larval food enrichment of inflow water by fish pond drainage might have caused observed increases in Mirogrex stock size since 1960.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 10	1988	169	1					91	106		10.1007/BF00007937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007937													WOS:A1988R086700009

Here, we developed primers for the detection of true geese and swan species using eDNA and optimised a PCR protocol for eDNA. We selected taiga bean goose (Anser fabalis fabalis) as our focal (sub)species and sampled water from lakes, from which the presence of taiga bean goose was visually confirmed. To test, if taiga bean goose DNA could be detected among DNA of other goose species, we similarly sampled eDNA from a zoo pond housing several Anatidae species. We were able to detect taiga bean goose DNA in all but one of the tested lakes, including the zoo pond. The primers developed are not species-specific, but rather specific to the genus Anser, due to the close relatedness of Anser species, which prevented the development of species-specific primers and the use of, for example, quantitative PCR. We also developed eDNA primers for Branta species and Cygnus species and tested these primers using the same samples. Canada goose (B. canadensis) and barnacle goose (B. leucopsis) DNA were only detected in the zoo pond (in which they were present), as the sampled natural lakes fall outside the range of these species. We detected whooper swan (C. cygnus) DNA in three lakes and the zoo pond (in which the species was present). The eDNA method presented here provides a potential means to monitor elusive goose species and to study the co-occurrence of large waterfowl.

Palynological record of Holocene vegetation and climate changes in a high-resolution peat profile from the Xinjiang Altai Mountains, northwestern China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A high-resolution pollen record in a peat sequence from the Altai Mountains of Xinjiang, China, allows reconstruction of the regional vegetation and climate changes that occurred during the Holocene. Pollen distributions from the sequence indicate that the vegetation community in the Altai Mountains region transitioned through five general phases: forest and desert steppe, wet steppe, desert steppe, steppe, and finally forest and desert steppe. These vegetative phases imply that the regional climate changed from a cold and dry early Holocene to a warmer and wetter early-mid Holocene and then to a cold and rather dry mid-Holocene that was followed by a cool and wet late Holocene and finally by warm and dry conditions for the last millennium. These regional changes in climate are roughly consistent with local changes previously reconstructed from organic geochemical paleoclimate proxies in the same peat sequence by Zhang et al. (2016), but with some minor but important differences that reflect local factors. Regional comparisons reveal that the Holocene climate changes in the Altai Mountains are generally consistent with those of most arid central Asian regions that are influenced mainly by westerlies. However, they are out-of-phase with the climate histories of regions controlled by the Asian monsoons, indicating that the Asian monsoons did not extend to the high-altitude mountain regions of arid central Asia during the Holocene. We postulate that the regional Holocene moisture variations have been mainly modulated by NAO variations that affected transport of water vapor from the North Atlantic Ocean by the westerlies. Moreover, local factors that include topography of the mountains and glacial meltwater events in the high-altitude regions also contributed to the climate changes in the Altai Mountains. In addition, air temperatures related to summer insolation of the Northern Hemisphere might have played an important role in modulating moisture in the region, but only after the local montane ice-sheets had disappeared by the mid-Holocene.

Two main problems of this construction are: occupying usable areas and the connection and integration of the power plant into the electricity system. The construction of US-PV power plants on water accumulations of existing hydro power plants was analyzed, as one of the solutions to these problems. The Jablanica Lake was taken as an example. Jablanica Lake is an artificial accumulation lake on the river Neretva with an area of 13 km(2) within the hydroelectric power plant (HPP) Jablanica with 180 MW of installed power. It was shown that on a surface of less than 3% of the total area of the accumulation of HPP Jablanica, there could be built a floating photovoltaic (PV) plant with a power of 30 MW. This power would add another generator of 30 MW to HPP Jablanica, which would increase the current number of the 6 generators to 7. This would enable significantly better exploitation of the Neretva and Rama river basins, and increase production in the summer period with a decrease in lake level oscillations. Suitable locations for the installation of floating solar power plant were analyzed. Locations are selected on the basis of requirements for the preservation of existing lake functions, and provide the possibility of installing a 3 MW power plant. 10 of these plants, connected by a 20 kV power grid, represent one US-PV 30 MW plant, which at one point connects to the transmission network of 220 kV. The specifications of one 3 MW power plant are given in terms of the required area, number of modules and number of inverters. A preliminary techno-economic analysis of the total plant was carried out. In this analysis, the possible production, the indicative price of the plant, and the price of the produced kWh of electricity are calculated.

This site is located in the Arizona Upland subdivision. Departures and arrivals of various perennial plant species during the Holocene were similar to other records from more southerly sites and support earlier generalizations of Van Devender [Van Devender, T.R., 1990. Late Quaternary vegetation and climate of the Sonoran Desert, United States and Mexico. in: Betancourt, J.L., Van Devender, T.R., Martin, P.S. (Eds,), Packrat Middens: The Last 40,000 Years of Biotic Change. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, pp. 134-165.] regarding the tempo and mode of late Quaternary changes in the Arizona Upland. Evergreen woodland containing Pinus monophylla (singleleaf pinyon), Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper), and Quercus turbinella (shrub live oak) occupied the site during full glacial times. The latter two species, but not P. monophylla, persisted into the early Holocene and were joined by a limited number of desertscrub species, including Acacia greggii (catclaw), Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro), and several other succulents. With the arrival of many other species during the middle Holocene, a desertscrub community that differed considerably from the modem vegetation developed. Acacia greggii and Cercidium floridum (blue paloverde) were the principal large woody species on exposed hillslopes. Assemblages similar in composition to the modem desertscrub did not appear until approximately 4000 years ago, when the more xerophytic Cercidium microphyllum (foothills paloverde) arrived and C. floridum disappeared from hillslopes. The delayed arrival of C. microphyllum in comparison to other Sonoran Desertscrub species with similar climatic tolerances is attributed to the Limited dispersal distance of its seeds by seed-eating heteromyid rodents. At 4540 and 6425 yr B.P., the cold-intolerant shrub Encelia farinosa was present on northeasterly aspect exposures where it is absent today, suggesting slightly warmer winter conditions during the middle Holocene. The presence of the tree Cercidium floridum and the perennial, C-4 grass Setaria leucopila on exposed slopes during the middle Holocene indicates substantially moister conditions during that time than in the late Holocene or today. At sites on the xeric Limits of the modern distributions of both species, average annual precipitation is from 50% to 100% greater than that presently received at Eagle Eye Mountain. In particular, the responses of S. leucopila and cacti during the middle Holocene indicate substantial increases in warm-season precipitation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Multiple independent records of local glacier variability on Nuussuaq, West Greenland, during the Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The sensitivity of mountain glaciers to small-scale climate fluctuations makes records of their past extent among the best proxies for identifying spatio-temporal climate variability. Here we build on the few existing Holocene records of local glacier change in Greenland by using three independent geochronological methods proglacial lake sediment analysis, cosmogenic 10Be surface-exposure dating, and in situ 14C burial modeling to reconstruct continuous records of Holocene glacier variability on Nuussuaq, West Greenland.10Be ages of perched boulders indicate eastern Nuussuaq was deglaciated between-11.0 and 10.5 ka. Radiocarbon-dated sediments from two lakes on Nuussuaq contain mineral-rich layers between-9.6 and 9.0 and-8.7-8.0 cal ka BP that may be correlative with nearby ice sheet moraines deposited in the early Holocene. Multiple proxies for glacier size indicate frequent, high-amplitude glacier fluctuations superimposed on net glacier growth during the late Holocene, with significant ice expansion phases at-3.7 ka, 2.8 ka, and throughout the past-2 ka. Mean 10Be ages from five nested moraine crests confirm that local glacier extents on Nuussuaq culminated during both the Little Ice Age 1-1470 C.E. (n = 3) and 1750 C.E. (n = 3)) and the preceding centuries (-520-1320 C.E.; n =11). Results reveal that local glaciers on Nuussuaq episodically advanced and retreated at centennial timescales throughout the Holocene, most likely in response to regional climate changes in West Greenland superimposed on the progressive insolation-driven cooling trend in the Northern Hemisphere. Our new 10Be moraine chronologies coupled with other glacier-size proxies corroborate an emerging pattern of significant summer cooling and glacier expansion in the centuries prior to the Little Ice Age in the Arctic.

The lack of a significant upward trend from March to July 1998 implies that TGM was removed from the boundary layer at a rate equal or greater than the surface emission. Three episodes of low C (0-1 ng m(-3)) occurred in July 1998, each lasting about 3 h. The TGM flux, F, was determined with the micrometeorological aerodynamic method. An episodic event of large positive F (emission) occurred in early spring of 1998 and appears to have been triggered by ice melting. It is proposed that three competing mechanisms - Hg vaporization, oxygen transport via roots, and diffusion into plants via stomata - may have played a role in the Hg exchange over other periods, resulting in bi-directional exchange of Hg with the atmosphere. Extrapolation of the 1998 data to the whole year suggests a weak sink removing 4 +/- 7 mu g Hg m(-2) yr(-1) from the atmosphere, a rate similar in magnitude to wet or particulate deposition to the site but much smaller than the rate of Hg accumulation in the sediment.

A survey was undertaken in September 2021 and March, April, and November 2022 to examine the phytoplankton structure and the environmental variables influencing ecological niche differentiation in the waters of Tahe Bay in Lushun, Dalian city, China. The findings indicated that there are 83 species representing forty-one genera and six phyla, with an annual mean abundance of 22.13 x 104 ind<middle dot>m-3, predominantly represented by Bacillariophyta (65 species, constituting 78.31% of the total species). The phytoplankton richness indices varied from 0.83 to 4.99, diversity indices ranged from 2.03 to 2.80, and evenness indices spanned from 0.28 to 0.84. Pearson's correlation between phytoplankton abundance and community diversity with environmental parameters, including water temperature, salinity, pH, DO, NH3-N, and NO3-N, was substantial in Tahe Bay's waters. The dominant species, comprising 20 species across three phyla, primarily include broad-niche species, with Paralia sulcata being the most prevalent species, except during summer. The extent of ecological niche overlap among the dominant species varied by season, exhibiting 40.0% severe overlap in September 2021, 100.0% severe overlap in March 2022, 93.0% severe overlap in April 2022, and 58.0% severe overlap in November 2022. The findings of redundancy analysis (RDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that COD, water temperature, NO3-N, DIP, NO2-N, and NH3-N are the primary environmental variables influencing the ecological niche differentiation of dominant species of phytoplankton. The results of the study elucidate the alteration rules of dominant species and the stability of the community structure of the phytoplankton community in this sea area, thereby offering a theoretical foundation for the scientific assessment of the ecological health of the area and the sustainable utilization of marine biological resources.					yin, zengqiang/GPS-7103-2022															2079-7737				MAY 21	2025	14	5							578	10.3390/biology14050578	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology14050578								40427767					WOS:001496579600001

The newly isolated strain grows optimally at ph 9.5 and 50-55 degreesC and its growth range is ph 6.0-10.5 and 30-65 degreesC. Unlike the already known thermoalkaliphiles, the strain grows heterotrophically on a variety of mono- and polysaccharides (glucose, ribose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, starch, pullulan, xylan and cellulose) and on proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone and tryptone. No dissimilatory sulfate reduction was observed, whereas thiosulfate was found to enhance growth when glucose or starch were used as substrates. Under optimal conditions, the doubling time is 48 min. Sodium ions are necessary for growth, with an optimal concentration of 230 mM (1% NaCl, w/v) at ph 9.5. The rod-shaped cells are motile in the exponential growth phase under optimal growth conditions. Despite the Cram-negative staining and negative KOH assay, the strain is a Cram-positive organism, having an atypically thin cell wall. A sheath-like structure occurs at the cell separation area and parts of a surface layer-like structure were also observed. Based on physiological properties and molecular biological analysis, the strain falls within the radiation of the clostridia and represents a new species of Anaerobranca within the Clostridium/Bacillus subphylum of the Cram-positive bacteria. Strain LBS3(T) (= DSM 13577(T)) is named Anaerobranca gottschalkii sp. nov. and is designated as the type strain.																			1466-5026					MAR	2001	51		2				457	465		10.1099/00207713-51-2-457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00207713-51-2-457								11321091					WOS:000167622500022
J	Rejesus, RM; Hornbaker, RH				Rejesus, RM; Hornbaker, RH			Economic and environmental evaluation of alternative pollution-reducing nitrogen management practices in central Illinois	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Nitrogen fertilizer application from production agriculture is likely the largest contributor to non-point source nitrate pollution in the United States. This type of pollution from the agricultural sector is an important policy issue because it may cause serious environmental and health risks to society. There have been studies that examined the different effects of nitrogen timing and rate practices, but none has yet compared the economic and environmental effects of these practices to site-specific management (SSM) precision technology. This paper examines the economic and environmental impacts of alternative nitrogen management practices, including SSM, within the Lake Decatur watershed of central Illinois. Thus, this study provides evidence on how different nitrogen management practices perform in terms of their effect on water quality and profitability. Data for the analysis were derived from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agronomic simulation model due to unavailability of actual on-site data. The analysis revealed that SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has great potential in reducing the mean and variability of nitrate pollution in the watershed while improving profitability of producers, relative to the current practice in the watershed. The management practice where fertilizer is applied during the spring at 140 kg ha(-1) provides reduction in mean and variability of nitrate pollution comparable to that of SSM. However, SSM technology substantially reduces the variability of net returns compared to the other management practices analyzed. Hence, SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has the potential to reduce nitrate pollution while reducing economic variability and maintaining profitability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

WATER REGULATION	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN NEW ZEALAND: CONDITIONS AND TRENDS												Water flows in rivers are regulated by a number of natural and human factors that result in the flow regime of a river. Several indices of flow regime are identified: these are the mean annual flood, the number of floods above a threshold (FRE3), the mean flow, the sequence of mean monthly flows through the year, and the mean annual 7-day low flow. These are useful indices that together help describe a flow regime. Values of FRE3 vary from 0 for spring-fed streams to over 20 for some West Coast streams. Specific mean flows, reflecting annual rainfall, vary from about 280 L s(-1) km(-2) for South Island West Coast rivers to less than 7 L s(-1)km(-2) for small east coast rivers. Specific mean annual flood flows, which are influenced by rainfall intensity, catchment storage (lakes, lithology) and catchment area, vary from over 5000 L s(-1) km(-2) to less than 60 L s(-1) km(-2). Seven-day minimum flows with return periods of 2 years, determined primarily by rainfall regime and catchment storage, range from over 50 L s(-1) km(-2) to less than 1 L s(-1) km(2). The factors regulating water flows are explored: they are principally climate (precipitation and evapotranspiration), geology, vegetation cover, and human activity. The importance of the flow regime to river biota and to human use of water is examined.

Establishment phase greenhouse gas emissions in short rotation woody biomass plantations in the Northern Lake States, USA	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												Uncertainty exists over the magnitude of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with open land conversion to short-rotation woody biomass crops (SRWC) for bioenergy in the Northern U.S. Lake States. GHG debts incurred at the plantation establishment phase may delay the climate mitigation benefits of SRWC production. To better understand GFIG debts associated with converting open lands to SRWC, we established research plantations with willow (Salix spp), hybrid-poplar (Populus spp.), and control plots in spring 2010 at two sites in northern Michigan (ES) and Wisconsin (RH). These sites had similar climates, but differed in time since last cultivation: 5 vs. 42 years. To address the short-term effects of plantation establishment, we compared two-year biomass production and GHG emissions. We hypothesized that the long-idle ES site, with higher initial soil C and N stocks, would have higher GHG emissions following conversion compared to the recently-idle RH site, but that this would be balanced in part by greater SRWC productivity at the ES site. As hypothesized, grassland conversion resulted in two-year net GHG emissions due to land conversion of 43.21 and 33.02 Mg-CO(2)eq ha(-1) for poplar and willow at ES that was far greater than the 4.81 and 1.54 Mg-CO(2)eq ha(-1) for poplar and willow at RH. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe greater SRWC productivity at ES, which will take longer than RH to reach C neutrality and begin mitigating GHG emissions. Our results show that site-specific soil and management factors determine the magnitude of GHG emissions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chowdhury, MR; Wells, MG; Cossu, R				Chowdhury, Mijanur R.; Wells, Mathew G.; Cossu, Remo			Observations and environmental implications of variability in the vertical turbulent mixing in Lake Simcoe	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A field study was conducted in Lake Simcoe to examine variations in turbulent mixing rates for a 40-day period in late summer of 2011. High sampling frequency records of water currents and temperature profiles were acquired using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a chain of fast-response temperature loggers respectively. The acquired data were processed to quantify the relative strengths of the stratification in relation to the velocity shear, expressed by the dimensionless gradient Richardson number (Ri(g)). We then used the calculated Rig as a proxy to estimate vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity (K-z) in the stratified water column of the lake. K-z exhibited large spatial and temporal variability with frequent high values in the epilimnion (K-z, similar to 10(-5)-10(-4) m(2) s(-1)) and relatively low values in the metalimnion (K-z similar to 10(-7)-10(-6) m(2) s(-1)) and the hypolimnion (K-z similar to 10(-6)-10(-5) m(2) s(-1)). We correlated the K-z, variability with the environmental forcing through the Lake number (L-N), which expresses the relative strengths of the stratification to the wind forcing. Analysis of the environmental implications of K-z variability suggested that vertical turbulent transport of dissolved oxygen was 10% of the total oxygen depleted in the hypolimnion for the observation period. We concluded that at least some of the observed year-to-year variability of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion could be due to the variation in turbulent transport of dissolved oxygen across the thermocline.

Application of conservative residual distribution schemes to the solution of the shallow water equations on unstructured meshes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS												We consider the numerical solution of the shallow water equations on unstructured grids. We focus on flows over wet areas. The extension to the case of dry bed will be reported elsewhere. The shallow water equations fall into the category of systems of conservation laws which can be symmetrized thanks to the existence of a mathematical entropy coinciding, in this case, with the total energy. Our aim is to show the application of a particular class of conservative residual distribution (RD) schemes to the discretization of the shallow water equations and to analyze their discrete accuracy and stability properties. We give a review of conservative RD schemes showing relations between different approaches previously published, and recall L-infinity stability and accuracy criteria characterizing the schemes. In particular, the accuracy of the RD method in presence of source terms is analyzed, and conditions to construct rth order discretizations on irregular triangular grids are proved. It is shown that the M-9 approach gives a natural way of obtaining high order discretizations which, moreover, preserves exactly the steady lake at rest solution independently on mesh topology, nature of the variation of the bottom and polynomial order of interpolation used for the unknowns. We also consider more general analytical solutions which are less investigated from the numerical view point. On irregular grids, linearity preserving RD schemes yield a truly second order approximation. We also sketch a strategy to achieve discretizations which preserve exactly some of these solutions. Numerical results on steady and time-dependent problems involving smooth and non-smooth variations of the bottom topology show very promising features of the approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Blood samples taken during June and July from 155 nestlings of four species of Ardeid birds (cattle egrets, black-crowned night herons, great egrets, and snowy egrets) and five nestling double-crested cormorants yielded a single WNV isolation from a 3-week-old cattle egret. Antibody was detected by enzyme immunoassay from 20 nestlings (13%), 14 (70%) of which were confirmed as positive by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). However, titration end points against WNV and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) were similar precluding viral identification. The grouping of positives within few nests, highest PRNT titers in youngest birds (< 1 weeks of age), the decline of titer with nestling age, and the lack of antibody specificity indicated that antibody may have been acquired maternally and did not represent new infections. Infection rates in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes collected near the Ardeid colony at Ramer Lake (3.1 per 1,000) were statistically similar to rates estimated at the nearby Wister Unit wetlands (5.3 per 1,000) that lacked an Ardeid nesting colony. Black-crowned night heron nestlings experimentally infected with the NY99 strain of WNV produced viremias > 5 log(10) plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and were considered moderately competent hosts, whereas cattle egret nestlings had viremias that remained <5 log(10) PFU/mL and were incompetent hosts.

J	Sumner, DY				Sumner, DY			Late Archean calcite-microbe interactions: Two morphologically distinct microbial communities that affected calcite nucleation differently	PALAIOS												Microbialites in the 2521 +/- 3 Ma Gamohaan and Frisco formations, South Africa, consist of three components: very thin, filmy laminae that are interpreted as remnants of microbial mats; irregular surfaces that acted as supports over which filmy laminae draped, which also are interpreted as microbial in origin; and cement-filled voids that formed contemporaneously with microbialite growth. The structure of the microbialites varies with the proportions of filmy laminae and supports, disruption of had filmy laminae, and abundance of voids. Seven end-member morphologies have been defined: planar laminae, contorted laminae, tented microbialites, cuspate microbialites, irregular columnar microbialites, plumose structures, and herringbone calcite beds. Similar structures have not been reported in younger rocks, but they may have partial analogs in Yellowstone hot springs, ice covered lakes in Antarctica, and Proterozoic conoform stromatolites. Herringbone calcite, a fibrous marine cement, precipitated contemporaneously with microbial growth. It preferentially precipitated on the supports over the laminated mat as demonstrated by: the concentration of herringbone calcite near supports; growth banding in herringbone calcite, which indicates that calcite nucleated on and grew away from supports but not laminated mat; and the abutment of herringbone calcite coatings against laminated mat attached to supports. These observations suggest that the laminated mat inhibited nucleation. of calcite crystals. The differences in the morphology and relationships to herringbone calcite in the supports and laminated mat imply that they were composed of distinct microbial communities that interacted with their environment differently. Also, the complexity of the microbialites demonstrates that a remarkably diverse set of microbe-substrate interactions evolved by late Archean time.

J	Knight, J; Leitch, CHB				Knight, J; Leitch, CHB			Phase relations in the system Au-Cu-Ag at low temperatures, based on natural assemblages	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												The composition of some 85 particles of native gold from the 15 Mile rodingite in serpentinite showing in the Coquihalla gold district and the Wheaton Creek placer in the Dease Lake district, British Columbia, falls mainly within the Cu-rich portion of the Au-Ag-Cu phase diagram. The particles display a variety of textures, including exsolution-induced textures. The textures and phase compositions are used to construct a low-temperature phase diagram for the system Au-Ag-Cu. This diagram represents a system that equilibrated for a longer period of time at a lower temperature than is accessible in synthetic systems. In this diagram, the composition AuCu is nearly stoichiometric, a three-phase region is found among AuCu (Au1.0Cu0.971Ag0.003), Au2Cu(Au2.0Cu0.962Ag0.045), and Au3.0Ag0.71Cu0.23, and there is a two-phase region on the Au side of the Au2Cu-Au3.0Ag0.71Cu0.23 join. There are insufficient data to determine the phase relationships that exist between the compositions An and Au2Cu, which includes Au3Cu. Au2Cu may or may not be part of a solid solution centered around Au3Cu. The sequence of formation of extensive exsolution-induced textures and their relation to the other textures seen are explained by combining the phase diagram with a significant shift in the position of the solvi with temperature in this system. Low values of Ag in Au-Cu alloy and of Cu in Au-Ag alloy are reported. Grains of gold alloy from deposits where no Au-Cu alloy is found appear to be undersaturated with respect to Cu.																			0008-4476					JUN	2001	39		3				889	905		10.2113/gscanmin.39.3.889	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gscanmin.39.3.889													WOS:000170460000016

Turnover in biological and ecological trait compositions of recorded bryophytes is assessed to explore changes in dominant life-strategies and habitats.LocationThe study area covers Siberia and Alaska (55 degrees-90 degrees N, 50 degrees-150 degrees E and 40 degrees-90 degrees N, 150 degrees E-140 degrees W).TaxonBryophytes.MethodsWe leveraged a dataset of plant DNA metabarcoding (chloroplast, trnL) of sedimentary ancient DNA from 26 lake sediment cores. Our statistical analyses only target DNA reads assigned to bryophytes.ResultsA total of 120 amplicon sequence variants were obtained, which could be assigned 100% to bryophyte taxa. Our results indicate that the dominant families in the palaeo-record reflect well the dominant families observed in Siberia and Alaska, and compositional changes reflect mainly the modern latitudinal gradient. For example, Sphagnum shows a clear post-glacial expansion pattern. Richness was high in times of high habitat diversity. Our data reveal a turnover from biological traits characteristic of an r-strategy (colonists/short-lived, small size, monoicous, long sporophyte season, small spores) during the glacial towards a K-strategy (long-lived, large size, dioicous, short sporophyte season, large spores) during the Holocene. The ecological traits indicate a shift towards taxa with a preference for high summer temperature, forested habitats, soil acidity and wetlands.Main ConclusionsOur results indicated substantial changes in the diversity and taxonomic composition, and dominant biological and ecological traits of bryophyte communities along with past warming and related habitat changes at the transition from glacial period to Holocene. This may to some extent represent an analogue for ongoing ecological change in northern high latitudes. Leveraging bryophyte records in sedimentary ancient DNA reveals promising results which could be enhanced once bryophyte representation in biodiversity and genetic databases has increased and bryophyte-specific ancient DNA methods become established.

J	Koç, DL				Koc, Deniz Levent			Assessment of the Performance of Some Evaporation Models Under Cukurova Region Conditions	JOURNAL OF TEKIRDAG AGRICULTURE FACULTY-TEKIRDAG ZIRAAT FAKULTESI DERGISI												Evaporation is the main factor of the water cycle. The quantification of evaporation is crucial for water resource management, determination of water availability, irrigation scheduling, and environmental modeling studies. Class A pans are commonly used worldwide to measure evaporation from open water surface and to estimate evapotranspiration for irrigation scheduling and water management for field and horticultural crops. Continuous measurement of daily pan evaporation may not be possible due to practical, theoretical, or financial reasons. Many models have been developed to estimate evaporation from open water surface using meteorological data. In this study, a total of 10 evaporation models based on temperature, radiation, mass transfer, and combination (Penman1948, Kohler-Nordenson-Fox (KNF)-1955, Papadakis-1961, Hamon-1961, Antal-1973, Linacre-1977, Hanson & Rauzi-1977, Kharrufa-1985, Abtew-1996, Modified-Turc-1996) were used to estimate daily measured evaporation values in Class A pan using 30-year climate data for the summer growing season in the cukurova region. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and relative error (RE) statistic approaches were used to determine the accuracy and reliability of the models. According to results obtained from the research, the KNF model was the best model with the seasonal mean lowest RMSE, RE, and MBE values (RMSE = 1.5 mm day(-1), RE = 0.4, MBE = -0.1 mm day(-1)), whereas Hamon was the worst model with the seasonal mean highest RMSE, RE, and MBE values (RMSE = 6.9 mm day(-1), RE = 1.3, MBE = 6 mm day(-1)) to estimate evaporation from Class A Pan. In the study, the Hanson & Rauzi model gave very similar results to the KNF model (seasonal mean values: RMSE = 1.6 mm day(-1), RE = 0.4, MBE = 0.7 mm day(-1)). In addition, the fact that the Hanson & Rauzi model uses less meteorological data than the KNF model has shown that the Hanson & Rauzi model can be an alternative to the KNF model under the conditions of the cukurova region.

In such settings, large water accumulations are not expected and precipitated water drains vertically, gathers in deep, large-scale aquifers, and outflows in large karstic springs located in deeply incised valleys. Some small lakes, however, exist in high alpine areas. Most commonly, they formed above impermeable glacial sediments and are generally characterized by stagnant waters. Jezero v Ledvicah lake, which is one of the seven lakes in the Triglav Lakes Valley, is an exception, because it shows high subaqueous water inflow and outflow and occurs among highly karstified and permeable carbonates. Combining previous research with our new, detailed geological mapping of the lake surroundings and sedimentary research on the Lower Jurassic strata, we propose a hydrogeological model with the aim of explaining the extraordinary behaviour of the lake. We propose that Jezero v Ledvicah lake: A) is part of the "guttershaped" aquifer with perched groundwater that is situated below the floor of the Triglav Lakes Valley; B) barriers of the aquifer are structural (faults and thrust) and stratigraphic (clay interlayers in Lower Jurassic limestone); C) the lake formed in a structural, hydrogeological and morphological depression within this aquifer; D) the groundwater of the aquifer is recharged not solely from the surface directly above the aquifer but additionally by subterraneous inflow from the overlying Slatna Nappe aquifer; and E) groundwater outflows from the aquifer at the southern end of the Triglav Lakes Valley, where the Lower Jurassic limestone pinches out.					; Verbovšek, Timotej/AAG-7914-2020	Popit, Tomislav/0000-0002-9184-8976; Verbovsek, Timotej/0000-0002-1908-5759; 													0583-6050	1580-2612					2019	48	3					265	282		10.3986/ac.v48i3.7446	http://dx.doi.org/10.3986/ac.v48i3.7446													WOS:000503414100001

The effects of volcanic gases on life may be direct, such as asphyxiation, respiratory diseases and skin burns; or indirect, e.g. regional famine caused by the cooling that results from the presence of sulfate aerosols injected into the stratosphere during explosive eruptions. Although accounting for fewer fatalities overall than some other forms of volcanic hazards, history has shown that volcanic gases are implicated frequently in small-scale fatal events in diverse volcanic and geothermal regions. In order to mitigate risks due to volcanic gases, we must identify the challenges. The first relates to the difficulty of monitoring and hazard communication: gas concentrations may be elevated over large areas and may change rapidly with time. Developing alert and early warning systems that will be communicated in a timely fashion to the population is logistically difficult. The second challenge focuses on education and understanding risk. An effective response to warnings requires an educated population and a balanced weighing of conflicting cultural beliefs or economic interests with risk. In the case of gas hazards, this may also mean having the correct personal protection equipment, knowing where to go in case of evacuation and being aware of increased risk under certain sets of meteorological conditions. In this chapter we review several classes of gas hazard, the risks associated with them, potential risk mitigation strategies and ways of communicating risk. We discuss carbon dioxide flows and accumulations, including lake overturn events which have accounted for the greatest number of direct fatalities, the hazards arising from the injection of sulfate aerosol into the troposphere and into the stratosphere. A significant hazard facing the UK and northern Europe is a "Laki"-style eruption in Iceland, which will be associated with increased risk of respiratory illness and mortality due to poor air quality when gases and aerosols are dispersed over Europe. We discuss strategies for preparing for a future Laki style event and implications for society.																			2364-3277	2364-3285	978-3-319-44097-2; 978-3-319-44095-8				2018							65	83		10.1007/11157_2015_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11157_2015_14	10.1007/978-3-319-44097-2												WOS:000474618900005

Rehabilitation Stocking of Walleyes and Lake Trout: Restoration of Reproducing Stocks in Michigan Waters of Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush and Walleye Sander vitreus, native keystone predators of the upper Great Lakes, were nearly extirpated from Lake Huron in the 1940s. Efforts to restore these species in the Great Lakes constitute one of North American's largest-scaled native keystone predator recovery projects. From 1973 to 2012 nearly 49 million yearling-equivalent Lake Trout and 21 million spring-fingerling Walleyes were stocked in western Lake Huron. We used assessment catch rates and biological data, statistical catch-at-age models, and harvest statistics to evaluate whether the objectives of rehabilitation stocking and management have been achieved in the Main Basin of Lake Huron, with emphasis on the period from 2003 to 2012. Key measures of progress were the biomass of older, spawning stock and evidence of natural reproduction. Until 2000, excessive Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus-and fishing-induced mortality caused few Lake Trout to survive to spawning age. Lake Trout broodstock biomass rose after 2000 as these issues were more effectively addressed. Until 2004, Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus dominated the diets of Lake Trout, leading to low egg thiamine levels, which reduced the viability of Lake Trout fry. Adult Alewives were abundant enough to have limited reproduction by feeding on Walleye and Lake Trout fry. By 2004, Alewife had collapsed. The Walleye population is now rehabilitated in western Lake Huron and Walleye stocking ceased in 2006. Wild-origin fish now compose nearly half of Lake Trout less than 8 years old. A combination of factors contributed these positive changes. Beginning in 2000, more effective Sea Lamprey and fishing controls were implemented. Seneca strain Lake Trout survived to spawning age better than other upper Great Lakes strains and became the principal strain stocked after about 1995. Removal of impediments to reproduction, combined with judicious stocking led to the Walleye recovery and improved prospects for the rehabilitation of Lake Trout in western Lake Huron.																			1522-2055	1548-8454					2015	77	3					396	408		10.1080/15222055.2014.993488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2014.993488													WOS:000359951100016

Spatial variation of methane (CH4) efflux from the littoral zone of a meso-eutrophic boreal lake was studied with a closed-chamber technique for three summer days in 22 vegetation stands, consisting of three emergent and three floating-leaved species. 2. Between-species differences in CH4 emission were significant. The highest emissions were measured from the emergent Phragmites australis stands (0.5-1.7 mmol m(-2) h(-1)), followed by Schoenoplectus lacustris > Equisetum fluviatile > Nuphar lutea > Sparganium gramineum > Potamogeton natans. Within-species differences between stands were not significant. 3. In P. australis stands, the stand-specific mean CH4 emission was significantly correlated with solar radiation, probably indicating the role of effective pressurised ventilation on CH4 fluxes. The proportion of net primary production emitted as CH4 was significantly higher in P. australis stands (7.4%) than in stands of S. lacustris and E. fluviatile (both 0.5%). 4. In N. lutea stands, CH4 efflux was negatively correlated with the mean fetch and positively with the percentage cover of leaves on the water surface. There were no differences in CH4 efflux between intact N. lutea leaves and those grazed by coleopteran Galerucella nymphaeae. In S. graminaeum and P. natans stands, CH4 effluxes were not related to any of the measured environmental variables. 5. For all vegetation stands, the biomass above water level explained about 60% of the observed spatial variation in CH4 emission, indicating the important role of plants as gas conduits and producers of substrates for methanogens in the anoxic sediment.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020	Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; Arvola, Lauri/0000-0003-1380-0659; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2003	48	9					1617	1629		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01113.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01113.x													WOS:000185095700010
J	WINNELL, MH; JUDE, DJ				WINNELL, MH; JUDE, DJ			BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION AMONG ROCKY HABITATS IN THE GREAT-LAKES AND KEUKA LAKE, NEW-YORK	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic invertebrates were collected from 12 rocky sites in Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, and Keuka Lake, New York. Proportionate abundances of benthic components occurring in rock scrape (131 spp.) and pumped (167 spp.) samples (190 spp. total) were compared using coefficient of community (CC) and percent similarity of community (PSc). Pumped samples were judged better estimates of benthic community structure and composition than were rock scrape samples because they more thoroughly and instantaneously sampled the benthos. Rock scrape samples in particular were subject to loss of Amphipoda. Comparisons among sites using CC, PSc, and cluster analysis indicated two major clusters of sites, one dominated by Chironomidae and the other dominated for the most part by the amphipod Hyalella azteca. No water chemistry differences of biological importance were noted during the fall and no biological interactions, such as fish predation, could explain observed benthic community differences. The factor which best accounted for differences in the benthic community among sites was physical characteristics such as water temperature, shelter from excessive wave activity, and rock configuration. However, despite differences, the most remarkable feature among rock sites was their similarity since dominant taxa of Amphipoda, Chironomidae, Acarina, and to some extent Naididae, were quite predictable, although rank order of dominance changed from site to site. Similarity among sites was attributed to similar trophic conditions, while dissimilarity was attributed to physical characteristics acting within and upon each site.																			0380-1330						1987	13	1					3	17		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71622-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71622-0													WOS:A1987H174300002

The levels of about 40 different organochlorines (PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes, toxaphenes, HCH, HCB) were compared with respect to age, sex, fat content, and year of collection. The levels of PCBs correlated very closely with those of DDE, indicating long-range transport as the major source of these contaminants in Iceland, with the ratio PCBs/DDE mostly in the range of 2-5. Unlike the Gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus, the organochlorine levels did not seem to accumulate substantially with age, neither in males nor females. The variation in the levels of OCs at the age of 2 years was even greater than the variation in OC levels over an age range of 12 years. In immature birds the levels of PCBs, DDE, HCB and beta-HCH declined very slowly (T-1/2 from 12 to 20 years) over the years 1976-1996, whereas the levels of alpha-HCH and p,p'-DDT declined much faster. The levels of trans-nonachlor, alpha-chlordane, gamma-chlordane, oxychlordane, and toxaphene did not correlate with the year of collection. As the Black Guillemot is mostly a resident seabird, feeding mainly on small fish and invertebrates, this investigation should give a good indication of the temporal trends of organochlorine pollution at Breioafjorour, Iceland, during this 20 year period and is likely to reflect baseline trends in the marine environment of the North-Atlantic Ocean.

Examination of sugar alcohols/polyols, sugars, and anhydrosugars in the upper Midwest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Carbohydrate measurements of ambient samples can provide insights into the biogenic fraction of the organic carbon (OC) aerosol. However, lack of measurement on a routine basis limits data analysis. In a companion paper, 1 year of archived 1-in-6 day FRM (Federal Reference Monitor) filter samples from the PM2.5 NAAQS compliance monitoring network collected at 10 sites in the upper Midwest were analyzed using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection to determine the regional impact of biomass burning. Along with levoglucosan, 13 other carbohydrates were simultaneously measured, including two more anhydrosugars (mannosan and galactosan), five sugars (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, xylose), and six sugar alcohols/polyols (glycerol, methyltetrols, threitol/erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol). This paper focuses on the results from these carbohydrates in order to investigate their sources and trends both spatially and temporally. Mannosan, galactosan, arabinose, xylose, and threitol/erythritol all correlated with levoglucosan (R-2 from 0.43 to 0.97), suggesting biomass burning as their main source. Glucose and mannitol exhibited higher concentrations in summer and at more southern sites, likely due to vegetation differences at the sites. Using mannitol, the contribution of spores to OC was found to be <1%. Methyltetrols were highly correlated with water-soluble OC (R-2 from 0.63 to 0.95) and in higher concentrations at more eastern sites. This spatial pattern is possibly due to these sites being downwind of the high isoprene emission zones that occur in the western part of the Midwest from oak forests in the Ozarks and spruce forests in the northern lake states.

J	Ni, XJ; Yuan, YP; Liu, WL				Ni, Xiaojing; Yuan, Yongping; Liu, Wenlong			Impact factors and mechanisms of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) losses from agricultural fields: A review and synthesis study in the Lake Erie basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) losses from agricultural fields promote algae growth in water bodies, and may increase the risk of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Using existing data from the Lake Eric Basin, we applied multiple regression analysis to better understand the impacts of both site-specific conditions (e.g., soil types/properties) and management practices (e.g., Agricultural Conservation Practices [ACP]) on annual DRP losses in subsurface and surface runoff. Results showed that soil properties significantly impact DRP losses. Greater DRP losses were associated with increased soil pH and Soil Test Phosphorus (STP). By contrast, soil organic matter (SOM) was inversely correlated with DRP losses. Soil clay content was also inversely correlated with DRP subsurface losses, but had no impact on DRP surface losses. The ACPs evaluated had varied effectiveness on DRP loss reduction. Cropping systems involving soybean could reduce DRP subsurface losses, whereas winter cover crops could cause unintended DRP subsurface losses. Cropping systems involving soybean and cover crops, however, had no impact on DRP surface losses. In addition, no-till and conservation tillage also enhanced DRP losses compared to conventional tillage, particularly for soils with high SOM and/or high clay content. Precipitation amount and fertilizer application rate significantly increased DRP surface losses as expected. Fertilizer application rate, however, had no impact on DRP subsurface losses. The impact of precipitation amount on DRP subsurface losses depends on SIP levels. Precipitation amount significantly increases DRP subsurface losses when STP is higher (>41 mg kg(-1) in this analysis). The optimal STP level for crop growth is 30 to 50 mg kg(-1). Results from this study help us to better understand DRP losses and the effectiveness of ACPs for controlling them. We suggest taking soil surveys and soil tests into consideration when designing and/or implementing ACPs to manage DRP losses. Furthermore, the method we used for this study could be applied to other agricultural regions to investigate impacts of site-specific conditions and management practices on water quality.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on self-perceived fatigue, stress, and depression in first-year osteopathic medical students. Methods: This randomized controlled pilot study with repeated measures was conducted at the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine-Bradenton in Florida during the fall 2012 semester. First-year osteopathic medical students voluntarily enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to directed OMT (D-OMT), nondirected OMT (ND-OMT), or control groups. The D-OMT and ND-OMT groups received treatment by osteopathic physicians weekly for 4 weeks. The control group received no treatment. All groups completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Self-Perceived Stress Scale (SPSS), and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) depression scale before treatment (pretest), after 2 treatments (midtest), and after 4 treatments (posttest). Results: All participants self-reported as white and single, with both sexes equally represented, and had an mean age of 24 years. Analysis of ESS scores revealed a statistically significant decrease in the D-OMT group from pretest and posttest scores and a statistically significant increase in the ND-OMT group from pretest to midtest but not from pretest to posttest scores. No statistically significant differences were noted in the control group scores on this measure. No statistically significant differences were seen in the SPSS or PHQ-9 scores from pretest to midtest or pretest to posttest in any of the 3 groups. Conclusion: The D-OMT regimen used in the current study produced a statistically significant decrease in self-perceived fatigue in first-year osteopathic medical students. Osteopathic manipulative treatment represents a potential modality to reduce self-perceived distress in medical students. Further research is warranted.

The -350 m core spanning 1.2-1.3 myr is composed of alternating diatomaceous mud and glacial clays. Diatom stratigraphy and paleomagnetic data show a ca. 200 kyr deposition gap at 134 m, though the core contains the complete Brunhes chron of direct polarity (0-780 kyr). This unconformity, discovered for the first time in the Baikal cores, is direct evidence for tectonic activity in the Selenga region between 0.820 and 1 myr, during the uplift of the Primorsky Ridge inferred from land data. The diatom record in the core correlates well with the marine oxygen isotope stratigraphy and indicates climate-driven variations in diatom production. High-resolution pollen records spanning an interval from 0 to 130 kyr provide a clue to climate change in the Baikal region and Transbaikalia. Correlation of the BDP core and seismic profiling data allows age referencing of the seismoacoustic units and reflections which can be extrapolated onto a large area of the Posol'sk Bank and the shallow-water region near the Selenga Delta. The obtained results shed light on the Pleistocene climate history in the region and the geological history of the Baikal rift.

J	BURDEN, DG; MALONE, RF				BURDEN, DG; MALONE, RF			A CLASSIFICATION OF FRESH-WATER LOUISIANA LAKES BASED ON WATER-QUALITY AND USER PERCEPTION DATA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An index system developed for Louisiana lakes was based on correlations between measurable water quality parameters and perceived lake quality. Support data was provided by an extensive monitoring program of 30 lakes coordinated with opinion surveys undertaken during summer 1984. Lakes included in the survey ranged from 4 to 735 km2 in surface area with mean depths ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 m. Water quality data indicated most of these lakes are eutrophic, although many have productive fisheries and are considered recreational assets. Perception ratings of fishing quality and its associated water quality were obtained by distributing approximately 1200 surveys to Louisiana Bass Club Association members. The ability of Secchi disc transparency, total organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a to discriminate between perception classes was examined using probability distributions and multivariate analyses. Secchi disc and total organic carbon best reflected perceived lake conditions; however, these parameters did not provide the discrimination necessary for developing a quantitative risk assessment of lake trophic state. Consequently, an interim lakes index system was developed based on total organic carbon and perceived lake conditions. The developed index system will aid State officials in interpretating and evaluating regularly collected lake quality data, recognizing potential problem areas, and identifying proper management policies for protecting fisheries usage within the State.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	1987	9	2					179	193		10.1007/BF00394350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00394350								24254188					WOS:A1987K360200006

It is surrounded by Kunlun, Altun and Qilian mountains with arid climate, sparsely vegetated landscape and a fragile ecological environment. Investigations on Holocene climate variations in this northern part of the Tibetan Plateau are essential for a better understanding of regional climate dynamics. A mid-Holocene sediment record from Sugan Lake in the Qaidam Basin was investigated using the grain size, mineral, total organic matter content (TOC), C:N ratio (C/N) and element analyses. A depth-age model since similar to 7750 cal a BP had been made based on 8 AMS C-14 data after taking out 2200 years carbon reservoir effect. SO42--type water and sparse terrestrial vegetation with considerable evaporation caused by high temperature during the Holocene Megathermal Maximum were recorded from ca. 7750 to 5800 cal a BP. From 5800 cal a BP, hydrochemical characteristics shifted dramatically to the Cl-type, while aeolian activities intensified concurrently. A higher lake level with low evaporation/precipitation ratio as the result of cool and wet conditions were inferred between 5800 and 3580 cal a BP when the EASM weakened and westerly jet intensified. Colder and drier conditions were recorded probably due to the strengthening of the mid-latitude westerly circulation after 3580 cal a BP. However, the EASM probably prevailed shortly at 3580 similar to 3000 cal a BP and 1800 similar to 810 cal a BP, respectively. Cold/dry, cold/wet and cold/dry Little Ice Age fluctuation climate conditions and aeolian activities with risen lake level and diluted water were inferred from 580 to 280 cal a BP.					侯, 信宇/AAU-5997-2021; zhang, chengjun/HHC-4054-2022; Ayyamperumal, Ramamoorthy/AAH-8627-2021; Zhang, Xiao/ABC-8933-2021	AYYAMPERUMAL, RAMAMOORTHY/0000-0002-7903-4267; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2022	217								106527	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106527		JUL 2022											WOS:000888149500002

Double-crested cormorant eggs contained (on average) up to 433 ng kg(-1) wet weight 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, 151 ng kg(-1) 1,2,3,7,8-PnCDD, and 74 ng kg(-1) 2,3,7,8-TCDD whereas pelagic cormorant eggs contained up to 300, 99, and 28 ng kg(-1) wet weight of these respective congeners The dominant non-ortho-PCB was CB-126, which ranged as high as 2263 ng kg(-1) in double-crested cormorant eggs. Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs fell dramatically in the early 1990s, following both severe restrictions on the use of chlorophenolic wood preservatives and antisapstains and a switch from molecular chlorine bleaching to alternative bleaching technologies at pulp mills in the region. Concentrations of PCBs did not show similar marked declines over time. On the basis of total TEOs 148 ng kg(-1) and previously published documentation of effects in siblings of the cormorant eggs analyzed here, double-crested cormorant young may have exhibited significantly elevated EROD activity and/or brain asymmetries at all colonies from 1973 to 1989 and even at some colonies during the 1990s. Pelagic cormorant eggs collected from a few colonies in 1988-1989 also contained total THIS greater than the threshold value estimated for double-crested cormorants.																			0013-936X					MAR 1	2003	37	5					822	831		10.1021/es0208613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0208613								12666908					WOS:000181258600018

Impact of structural fabric on development of karst aquifer in Ayn Zayanah-Al Coeffiah area in Benghazi plain, NE Libya	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Ayn Zayanah-Al Coeffiah (synonym Al-Kweifiya) area is part of Al Jabal Al Akhdar in the northeast Benghazi city. The Miocene Benghazi Formation is the dominant lithology. It is affected by numerous karstic features (dolines and conduits) such as Hawa Buhmira, Eftimah and Al Majdoub lakes, as well as the Hawa Al Mirisi, and Hawa Bu Karmah caves. Detailed mapping and structural analysis in the conduit system and surrounding dolines indicated the passage pattern dominated by NW-SE to NE-SW and N to S oriented faults also the orientation of all dolines long axes are NW-SE, N-S, and NE-SW which is parallel to the regional fault systems of the Central-Western parts of Al Jabal Al Akhdar. The fault movement induced zones of broken and crushed rocks which increase dissolution and form small-scale karstic features. Here, the collected water on the surface for considerable time to be penetrating into the ground water through cavities leading to further stages of karstification. This separates the rock masses by free surface expansion due to stress relief and enlarged joints and faults followed by roofs collapsing and formation of the present dolines. This process of karstification plays a significant role in forming hydraulic connections between aquifers and seawater. This intrusion will increase whenever the groundwater is heavily-pumped through the Benghazi plain karstic systems. The coastal spring (Ayn Zayanah) is the main natural outlet of a wide catchment zone known as the Benghazi Groundwater Basin that discharges into the Blue Lagoon ended into the sea.					; Al Riaydh, Mohammed/MEO-9596-2025	El Shawaihdi, Moftah/0000-0001-6383-3542; AL RIAYDH, Mohammed/0000-0002-6871-4195; Salloum, Fathi/0009-0005-2032-6678													0891-2556	1878-5212				DEC	2022	37	4							65	10.1007/s13146-022-00811-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-022-00811-3													WOS:000850128400001

The ELSA-Vegetation-Stack: Reconstruction of Landscape Evolution Zones (LEZ) from laminated Eifel maar sediments of the last 60,000 years	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Laminated sediment records from several maar lakes and dry maar lakes of the Eifel (Germany) reveal the history of climate, weather, environment, vegetation, and land use in central Europe during the last 60,000 years. The time series of the last 30,000 years is based on a continuous varve counted chronology, the MIS3 section is tuned to the Greenland ice both with independent age control from C-14 dates. Total carbon, pollen and plant macrofossils are used to synthesize a vegetation-stack, which is used together with the stacks from seasonal varve formation, flood layers, eolian dust content and volcanic tephra layers to define Landscape Evolution Zones (LEZ). LEZ 1 encompasses the landscape dynamics of the last 6000 years with widespread human influence. The natural oak and hazel forests of the early Holocene back to 10,500 b2k define LEZ 2. LEZ 3, the late glacial between 10,500 and 14,700 b2k, shows the development of a boreal forest with abundant grass and shallow water biomass in the lakes. The maximum of the last glaciation (LEZ 4: 14,700-23,000 b2k) was characterized by sparse vegetation of moss and characeae. These sediments are generally devoid of clay and sand and reveal no indication of snow-meltwater events. Accordingly, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) must have been extremely arid in central Europe. The sediments of the subsequent LEZ 5 from 23,000-28,500 b2k preserve distinct layers of clay and coarse sand, which indicates running water with day in suspension and ephemeral coarse-grained fluvial sediment discharge. Abundant Ranunculaceae macroremains (used for C-14 dating), insects, moss and fungi sclerotia reflect a tundra environment during a time of frequent strong snowmelt events. Total carbon content, Betula-Pinus pollen and diatoms reach increased concentrations during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 interstadials that occurred between 28,500 and 36,500 b2k (LEZ 6). The entire MIS3 interstadials are well documented in the organic carbon record from the Auel dry maar. The main paleobotanical indicators of MIS3 are, however, grass pollen and heliophytes, which indicate a steppe environment with scattered/patchy trees during the interstadials. The stadial phases inferred during LEZ 6 reveal initiation of eolian dust deflation. The change of the early MIS 3 forested landscape to a steppe occurred with the LEZ 7-LEZ 6 transition. This is when modem man spread in central Europe. The principle vegetation change to a steppe at 36,500 b2k must have favoured the spread of horses, an important hunting prey of modem humans. We propose accordingly that the migration of the modern humans into central Europe might have been at least partly driven by climate and associated vegetation change. The LEZ 7 encompassed the time interval 36,500 to 49,000 b2k and was characterized by a boreal forest with high abundance of pine, birch, as well as spruce during the interstadial events. Abundant charcoal fragments indicate that this taiga was under frequent drought stress with regular burning. The most unexpected finding, but corroborated by all our maar records is the dominance of thermophilous tree taxa from 49,000 to 55,000 b2k (LEZ 8). Greenland interstadials 13 and 14 were apparently the warmest of MIS 3 according to the Eifel pollen records. The preceeding LEZ 9 from 55,000 to 60,000 b2k is also dominated by spruce, but thermophilous trees were sparse. A warm early MIS3 appears plausible, because summer insolation (at 60 degrees N) was higher in the early MIS 3 than today, ice cover was low in Scandinavia and sea-surface temperatures of the North Atlantic were almost comparable to modern values during GI-14.

J	Jones, B				Jones, Brian			Speleothems in a wave-cut notch, Cayman Brac, British West Indies: The integrated product of subaerial precipitation, dissolution, and microbes	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A wave-cut notch that is deeply incised into the vertical cliff faces of Cayman Brac is adorned with stalactites, stalagmites, and columns. The prefix "notch" is applied to each type of speleothem in order to distinguish them from cave speleothems. These speleothemic deposits must have formed since the highstand, similar to 125,000 years ago, which was responsible for the development of the notch. The laminated notch speleothems are formed largely of aragonite (small and large crystals) and calcite (columnar, fiber, and grain-coating mats) along with minor amounts of dolomite, a Mg-Si precipitate (kerolite?), gypsum, and halite. Laminae, typically <2 mm thick, are commonly bounded by dissolution discontinuities that truncate the older laminae and their formative aragonite and calcite crystals. The patchy tan, grey, to green surface coloration of the notch speleothems reflects the random distribution of the subaerial biofilms, which are formed of a diverse array of filamentous and non-filamentous microbes. The notch speleothems are the integrated product of precipitation and dissolution that was, in some places, microbially mediated. Interpretations based on their mineralogy and internal structures indicate that the composition of the formative waters must have temporally fluctuated with periods of precipitation being interrupted by periods of dissolution. The microbes that formed the subaerial biofilms may have influenced some of these processes. The aragonite, calcite, and kerolite (?) probably formed as evaporation and loss of Ca through precipitation progressively increased the Mg:Ca and the Si/(Ca + Mg) ratios. The dolomite, gypsum, and halite probably formed during early diagenesis during the evaporation of seawater that percolated into the interiors of the notch speleothems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Its unique location and extreme environmental conditions contribute to the formation of some of the world largest lakes, crucial components of the regional water cycle. These lakes not only store vast freshwater resources but also play a vital role in regulating the flow and quality of rivers, maintaining a delicate balance in the local ecosystem. Recent decades have witnessed rapid expansion of many plateau lakes, primarily attributed to glacial melt. However, evaluating the contribution of climate forcings to these changes remains challenging. In this study, we reconstructed Zhari Namco's lake -level changes between 5.3 ka and 1.3 ka based on optically stimulated luminescence dating, a period with relatively stable glacial amount on the Tibetan Plateau. Our analysis employed sediment grain size distribution, organic matter contents and their stable carbon isotopes. In contrast to recent expansions, our findings reveal a declining trend in Zhari Namco's lake level since the middle Holocene, consistent with intermittent paleo-shoreline records from major central Tibetan Plateau lakes. This regional decline is likely the result of a weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon. In addition to the long-term drying trend, we identified high -frequency fluctuations in Zhari Namco's lake level on centennial timescale. Further comparison with hydroclimate records from the tropics suggests that centennial high lake levels correlate with increased monsoonal precipitation during periods when ENSO activities were reduced. This study sheds lights on the historical dynamics and driving mechanisms of Zhari Namco's lake levels, providing valuable insights for predicting the impacts of future climate change on the Tibetan Plateau's water cycle.					; Liu, Yuning/AAB-1564-2021; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013	Liu, Xiang-Jun/0000-0002-8413-2451; li, xiang zhong/0000-0003-3491-8824; liu, guangxin/0000-0003-3545-4064; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				APR 15	2024	330								108593	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108593		MAR 2024											WOS:001207300400001
J	Obertegger, U; Flaim, G; Fontaneto, D				Obertegger, Ulrike; Flaim, Giovanna; Fontaneto, Diego			Cryptic diversity within the rotifer Polyarthra dolichoptera along an altitudinal gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Cryptic species (species that are difficult or impossible to distinguish morphologically) are found worldwide and neglecting them may hamper our understanding of species-environment relationships. The rotifer Polyarthra dolichoptera occurs across wide environmental gradients, indicating the potential for a cryptic species complex. We used P. dolichoptera as a model to investigate spatial patterns and relationships of cryptic species with environmental variables along a broad altitudinal gradient. 2. We sequenced 575 specimens of Polyarthra from 42 waterbodies from Germany, Hungary and Italy sampled in summer. Thirty-five lakes were distributed along an altitudinal gradient (250-2564 m a.s.l.) in a geographically restricted area, the Trentino-South Tyrol region, Italy, and one lake (Lake Tovel) was sampled in two basins and at different depths year-round to investigate temporal and spatial patterns of cryptic species. We used the Generalised Mixed Yule Coalescent model to delimit cryptic species (GMYC entities) based on a phylogenetic tree and related their presence/absence to space and the environment by applying Mantel tests and variance partitioning. 3. We found twelve GMYC entities of P. dolichoptera. In variance partitioning, most explained variability was attributed to the interaction between space and altitude and by environmental variables and geographical space alone. However, by splitting the data into sets of low-and high-altitude lakes, the strong effect of altitude was removed; conductivity and silica played a major role in high-altitude lakes, whereas neither environment nor space were related to entity occurrence in low-altitude lakes. In Lake Tovel, three cryptic entities were found that did not show spatial segregation; however, two entities showed temporal segregation while the third one occurred throughout the year. 4. Our study showed that P. dolichoptera is a complex of species which distribution is driven by geography and environmental parameters whose importance is different in low-and high-altitude lakes. Considerable unexplained variability points to a major contribution of other variables, potentially in-lake properties such as competition, predation and species behaviour.

The water level of the lake is currently rising, it is now at -5.8 m altitude. The lake currently has a maximum salinity of 2.4 g l-1 and no outlet. Abundant Holocene marine fossil molluscs, polychaetes and algae dated at 8000-4700 14C yr B.P. indicate that the lake was one basin of a complex marine inlet during the early to mid Holocene. A prominent terrace formed in the tide zone during this period. Processes involved in terrace formation are discussed using Watts Lake as an example. Other basins of this inlet have now become saline or hypersaline. Isostatic uplift isolated the whole inlet from the sea and allowed the basins to become separate lakes. From 4000-3000 14C yr B.P. copious volumes of freshwater from nearby stagnant ice and possibly from a major river system poured into Watts Lake displacing the salt water over a sill at the eastern end. Within 2000 yr the lake was fresh. Freshwater inflow declined and the lake level began to fall from evaporation. Cyanobacterial stomatolites formed from 2800 to 1700 14C yr B.P. at the eastern end of the lake. At least two other lakes in the Hills have similar histories.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR	1986	53	2-4					271	288		10.1016/0031-0182(86)90063-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(86)90063-5													WOS:A1986A988800010

In this respect, the present scientific incursion focused on two areas containing former extraction uranium ore sites, Ciudanovita and Lisava, as well as copper ore from Moldova Noua and charcoal mines from Anina, Banat Region, Romania. It highlighted that, for the first time, the heavy metal concentration was correlated with the values of physicochemical indicators of water (i.e., EC, DO, pH, resistivity, salinity, and ORP), by using multivariate analysis, to shape a regional based model on spatial distributions and the variability of toxic contaminants from the hydrographic basin of Banat, Romania, as a consequence of former uranium, copper, and charcoal mines. In this regard, 11 metals including Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd, and Pb from different water samples (well, spring, river, and lake), collected from three mining areas (uranium, copper, and coal mines) were investigated. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks of seven heavy metals were assessed using the EDI, DIM, and THQ. The obtained THQ values were within the acceptable limits for cancer risks for adults, but as regards children, eight samples out of 18 proved toxic. However, the HRI and THQ average values for Cd (0.265 adults/0.996 children) and Pb (0.025 adults/0.095 children) for children were 3-4 times higher than those for adults. This is a source of concern as their prevalence in well water exposes children and residents in the Banat Region to the risk of various types of cancers.					; Cristiana, Radulescu/B-4847-2011; DULAMA, Ioana Daniela/K-5095-2013; Stanescu, Sorina Geanina/I-9807-2018; Radulescu, Cristiana/B-4847-2011; Stirbescu, Raluca Maria/R-1656-2019; Bucurica, Ioan/AAB-1261-2019; pehoiu, gica/D-3099-2012; Stanescu, Sorina/I-9807-2018; Banica, Andreea Laura/GRY-6515-2022; Murarescu, Ovidiu/C-4284-2012; muratoreanu, george/IZP-8499-2023; DULAMA, Ioana-Daniela/K-5095-2013; Ionescu, Constantin/ABB-7698-2020	Ionescu, Constantin Aurelian/0000-0001-6063-2921; Cristiana, Radulescu/0000-0003-1208-7732; Stanescu, Sorina Geanina/0000-0003-1219-3420; Banica, Andreea Laura/0000-0002-5780-4507; DULAMA, Ioana-Daniela/0000-0003-0200-0867; 														1660-4601				NOV	2022	19	22							14866	10.3390/ijerph192214866	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192214866								36429587					WOS:000887302100001

Tellervo			Establishment and interspecific associations in two species of Ichthyocotylurus (Trematoda) parasites in perch (Perca fluviatilis)	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Co-infections of multiple parasite species in hosts may lead to interspecific associations and subsequently shape the structure of a parasite community. However, few studies have focused on these associations in highly abundant parasite species or, in particular, investigated how the associations develop with time in hosts exposed to co-infecting parasite species for the first time. We investigated metacercarial establishment and interspecific associations in the trematodes Ichthyocotylurus variegatus and I. pileatus co-infecting three age cohorts of young perch (Perca fluviatilis). Results: We found that the timing of transmission of the two Ichthyocotylurus species was very similar, but they showed differences in metacercarial development essentially so that the metacercariae of I. pileatus became encapsulated faster. Correlations between the abundances of the species were significantly positive after the first summer of host life and also within the main site of infection, the swim bladder. High or low abundances of both parasite species were also more frequent in the same host individuals than expected by chance, independently of host age or size. However, the highest abundances of the species were nevertheless observed in different host individuals and this pattern was consistent in all age cohorts. Conclusions: The results suggest similar temporal patterns of transmission, non-random establishment, and facilitative rather than competitive associations between the parasite species independently of the age of the infracommunities. However, we suggest that spatial differences in exposure are most likely responsible for the segregation of the parasite species observed in the few most heavily infected hosts. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the result suggests that between-species associations should be interpreted with caution along with detailed examination of the parasite distribution among host individuals.					; Faltynkova, Anna/L-9321-2014	Karvonen, Anssi/0000-0002-2731-3344; Faltynkova, Anna/0000-0003-3013-5881													1756-3305					MAY 20	2011	4								85	10.1186/1756-3305-4-85	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-4-85								21599910					WOS:000291995200001
J	Szereszewski, KE; Storey, KB				Szereszewski, Kama E.; Storey, Kenneth B.			Translational regulation in the anoxic turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY												The red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans), has developed remarkable adaptive mechanisms for coping with decreased oxygen availability during winter when lakes and ponds become covered with ice. Strategies for enduring anoxia tolerance include an increase in fermentable fuel reserves to support anaerobic glycolysis, the buffering of end products to minimize acidosis, altered expression in crucial survival genes, and strong metabolic rate suppression to minimize ATP-expensive metabolic processes such as protein synthesis. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is at the center of the insulin-signaling pathway that regulates protein translation. The present study analyzed the responses of the mTOR signaling pathway to 5 (5H) or 20 h (20H) of anoxic submergence in liver and skeletal muscle of T. scripta elegans with a particular focus on regulatory changes in the phosphorylation states of targets. The data showed that phosphorylation of multiple mTOR targets was suppressed in skeletal muscle, but activated in the liver. Phosphorylated mTOR(Ser2448) showed no change in skeletal muscle but had increased by approximately 4.5-fold in the liver after 20H of anoxia. The phosphorylation states of upstream positive regulators of mTOR (p-PDK-1(Ser241), p-AKT(Ser473), and protein levels of G beta L), the relative levels of dephosphorylated active PTEN, as well as phosphorylation state of negative regulators (TSC2(Thr1462), p-PRAS40(Thr246)) were generally found to be differentially regulated in skeletal muscle and in liver. Downstream targets of mTOR (p-p70 S6K(Thr389), p-S6(Ser235), PABP, p-4E-BP1(Thr37/46), and p-eIF4E(Ser209)) were generally unchanged in skeletal muscle but upregulated in most targets in liver. These findings indicate that protein synthesis is enhanced in the liver and suggests an increase in the synthesis of crucial proteins required for anoxic survival.					; Storey, Kenneth/G-9883-2011	Szereszewski, Kama/0009-0002-7995-0844; 													0300-8177	1573-4919				AUG	2018	445	1-2					13	23		10.1007/s11010-017-3247-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-017-3247-y								29243067					WOS:000437464800002
J	Herget, J; Schütte, F; Klosterhalfen, A				Herget, Juergen; Schuette, Felix; Klosterhalfen, Anne			Empirical modelling of outburst flood hydrographs	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Naturally impounded lakes dammed by earth material like moraines and landslide deposits or glacier ice are capable of draining abruptly involving enormous amounts of water by overflow, seepage or drainage through pipes. Such kinds of outburst floods are among the largest floods by magnitude and provide a serious hazard due to their frequently unexpected occurrence. A new model approach based on previously observed outburst flood hydrographs is presented here as previous attempts contain several limitations. Due to numerous influencing factors, physical-based modelling to forecast the magnitude of future outburst floods is hindered by problems of achieving input data for case-studies to model. Blackbox models that correlate lake volume with peak discharge of the outburst flood are frequently found to provide a good correlation, but cannot describe unsteady flood components like rise and fall of the water level. Based on an intensive literature review, measured hydrographs of outburst floods from earth and ice-dammed lakes differentiated by drainage processes are compiled. After normalisation to reach a comparable style for the hydrographs of different flood magnitudes and durations, mean values when peak discharge is reached are determined. In combination with regression equations for the peak discharge and flood duration based on drained lake volume, potential hydrographs of future outburst floods can be estimated. So far, the approach is limited by low numbers of measured outburst flood events and missing correspondence of flood duration and drained volume for ice-dammed lakes. This approach could be improved by identification of more specific studies for the deduction of normalised hydrographs and regression equations.					; Klosterhalfen, Anne/NNG-1500-2025	Klosterhalfen, Anne/0000-0001-7999-8966; 													0372-8854						2015	59			3			177	198		10.1127/zfg_suppl/2015/S-59224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zfg_suppl/2015/S-59224													WOS:000366229400010
J	Berglund, M				Berglund, Mikael			Early Holocene in Gastrikland, east central Sweden: shore displacement and isostatic recovery	BOREAS												In Gastrikland in central Sweden, deglaciation took place c. 11 000 cal. a BP. In the present study the shore displacement during the earliest ice-free period is investigated by the C-14 dating of sediment from isolated lake basins. The shore displacement in Gastrikland includes an initial phase (similar to 500 years) of rapid regression, followed by a slowing of the relative sea level (RSL) fall to a rate similar to that of the remaining Holocene c. 9250 cal. a BP. The Ancylus Lake stage of the Baltic Sea belongs to the analysed interval. The RSL curve and glacial unloading history are used to separate and quantify elements of isostatic uplift. The postglacial uplift is similar to 260 m, of which similar to 45 m forms a rapid initial rise, which can be treated as qualitatively separate from the later, slower rise. There is considerable glacial unloading just prior to the deglaciation, but calculations suggest that only a small part of this relates directly to the rapid early Holocene rebound: most unloading is transferred either to uplift immediately prior to the deglaciation or to subsequent Holocene or future uplift. The isostatic rise in Gastrikland occurring between the end of the Younger Dryas stadial and the deglaciation, c. 11 50011 000 cal. a BP, is estimated to be 100-110 m. Observations and estimations are incompatible with a Weichselian maximum ice thickness much smaller that 3000 m. The lack of glacial unloading during the Younger Dryas has a measurable impact on the Holocene isostatic rebound in Gastrikland, reducing it by an estimated 20-25 m.																			0300-9483					APR	2012	41	2					263	276		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00228.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00228.x													WOS:000301781200006

In order to verify the performance of its instruments, a flight test of TanSat instruments was conducted in Jilin Province in September, 2015. The flight test area covered a total area of about 11,000 km(2) and the underlying surface cover included several lakes, forest land, grassland, wetland, farmland, a thermal power plant and numerous cities and villages. We modeled the column-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2) surface based on flight test data which measured the near- and short-wave infrared (NIR) reflected solar radiation in the absorption bands at around 760 and 1610 nm. However, it is difficult to directly analyze the spatial distribution of XCO2 in the flight area using the limited flight test data and the approximate surface of XCO2, which was obtained by regression modeling, which is not very accurate either. We therefore used the high accuracy surface modeling (HASM) platform to fill the gaps where there is no information on XCO2 in the flight test area, which takes the approximate surface of XCO2 as its driving field and the XCO2 observations retrieved from the flight test as its optimum control constraints. High accuracy surfaces of XCO2 were constructed with HASM based on the flight's observations. The results showed that the mean XCO2 in the flight test area is about 400 ppm and that XCO2 over urban areas is much higher than in other places. Compared with 000-2's XCO2, the mean difference is 0.7 ppm and the standard deviation is 0.95 ppm. Therefore, the modelling of the XCO2 surface based on the flight test of the TanSat instruments fell within an expected and acceptable range.

J	Bowling, LC; Blais, S; Sinotte, M				Bowling, Lee C.; Blais, Sylvie; Sinotte, Marc			Heterogeneous spatial and temporal cyanobacterial distributions in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain: An analysis of a 9 year data set	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A 9 year phytoplankton, water quality and meteorological database was analysed to determine changes in cyanobacterial community composition and abundance at 4 sites in Missisquoi Bay from 2000 to 2008, and possible environmental factors underlying changes. Exponential summer growth of cyanobacteria to in excess of 80% of the August phytoplanktonic biomass occurred in most years except 2000 and 2007. Considerable spatial heterogeneity was observed in cyanobacterial abundance, with biomass exceeding 100,000 mg/m(3) at eastern sampling sites on the bay. Microcystis spp. were generally dominant from 2001 to 2005, and the cyanotoxin microcystin was frequently detected during Microcystis blooms. Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum species were more common from 2006 onwards; however sometimes completely different taxa were dominant at different sampling sites on the same day. Highest total phosphorus concentrations occurred on the eastern side of the bay, while total nitrogen concentrations were mostly low at all sites, and molar TN:TP ratios were generally <20. Cyanobacterial biomass was at times significantly correlated with water quality attributes such as turbidity, nutrients and water temperature. Some correlations were also found with meteorological measures including maximum and minimum air temperature and wind speed. However, the correlations were often too weak (rho < 0.50) to be indicative of major relationships between the cyanobacteria and environmental factors. Likewise multivariate analyses indicated no strong relationships between community composition and abundance with the environmental attributes measured, and much of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the cyanobacterial blooms observed in Missisquoi Bay remains unexplained.

J	TREASURER, JW				TREASURER, JW			MORTALITY AND PRODUCTION OF 0+ PERCH, PERCA-FLUVIATILIS L, IN 2 SCOTTISH LAKES	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Mortality of 0+ Eurasian perch was measured directly from the decline in catch in a high-speed plankton sampler and described by a negative exponential model. A mean mortality of 0.063 day-1 (range = 0.020-0.089) was calculated; for 0+ juveniles it was 0.021 day-1. Mean larval production was 0.85-1.30 mg dry weight m-2 day-1 in Loch Kinord and 0.08-0.12 in Lock Davan. Annual production of 0+ juveniles was 1.97-7.55 kg wet weight ha-1 at L. Kinord and 1.01 kg at L. Davan. The contribution of 0+ perch, including the egg stages, to total perch production was 88-96%. Availability of food items on transition to exogenous feeding and through the larval period did not limit survival. Cannibalism by adults acounted for most of larval mortality, and predation by pike and adult perch were responsible for the majority of juvenile losses. The population structure of adult perch, for 12 year classes, was stable at L. Kinord, while year classes at L. Davan exhibited fluctuations in abundance and in two sampling years were eliminated in the first summer. Survival in the eleutheroembryonic phase was variable at L. Davan and observed to be low compared with L. Kinord. It is suggested that this was a result of water turbulence on the exposed and shallow spawning areas at L. Davan.

THE INTRARELATIONSHIPS AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE TEMNOSPONDYL FAMILY BRANCHIOSAURIDAE	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY												The larval or paedomorphic branchiosaurid temnospondyls, inhabitants of many Permo-Carboniferous freshwater lakes across Europe, have never been analysed cladistically. In the present work, we have analysed the relationships between at the well-defined species of the clade, with the following results: (1) despite homoplasies shared with amphibamids, the family Branchiosauridae forms a well-supported monophylum; (2) if Micropholis is considered to be an amphibamid, then Branchiosauridae have arisen within the Amphibamidae and could be considered to be a clade of paedomorphic amphibamids; (3) the closest relatives of branchiosaurids are the amphibamids Amphibamus and Platyrhinops; (4) the stratigraphically oldest genus Branchiosaurus, here represented by its only well-known species B. salamandroides, forms the most basal offshoot of the Branchiosauridae; (5) the remainder of the branchiosaurids fall into two clades referred to as the Melanerpeton-clade and Apateon-clade, respectively; (6) the Melanerpeton-clade is morphologically more diverse than the Apateon-clade; (7) within the Melanerpeton-clade, Schoenfelderpeton and Leptorophus are sister groups; (8) within Apateon, A. kontheri forms the basal-most taxon, followed by A. gracilis, A. pedestris, A. dracyiensis and the sister-taxa A. caducus and A. flagrifer. An evolutionary scenario suggests that branchiosaurids originated by invention of a key innovation: specialized pharyngeal denticles, housed in gill clefts, served as a filter-feeding device focussing on plankton. The group diversified in part, by patterns of delayed development of the upper jaw and cheek resulting in a kinetic maxilla, thereby permitting manipulation of the oral margin during suction feeding. It can be shown that within the Apateon-clade, the second component evolved along different lines into rather different adaptational directions, producing a range of morphotypes controlled by minor heterochronic changes.

During the campaign, three intensive observation periods (IOPs) were conducted and a large amount of data were collected. Subsequently, standalone modelling using the FLake lake model was used, first to assess the surface temperature and the surface energy balance, and second to determine the energy budget of the water column at the measurement site. Surface fluxes were validated against in situ measurements, and it was determined that heat exchanges are dominated by evaporation. We also demonstrated that the model was sensitive to the light extinction coefficient at Thau, due to its shallowness and clarity nature. A heat balance was calculated, and the inclusion of a radiative temperature has improved it, especially by reducing the nocturnal evaporation. The FLake lake model was then evaluated in three-dimensional numerical simulations performed with the Meso-NH mesoscale model, in order to assess the changing structure of the boundary layer above the lagoon during the IOPs more accurately. We highlighted the first time ever when Meso-NH and FLake were coupled and proved the ability of the coupled system to forecast a complex phenomenon but also the importance of the use of the FLake model was pointed out. We demonstrated the impact of the lagoon and more precisely the Lido, a sandy strip of land between the lagoon and the Mediterranean Sea, on the vertical distribution of turbulent kinetic energy, evidence of the turbulence induced by the breeze. This study showed the complementarities between standalone and coupled simulations.					; Lagarde, Franck/AAC-4490-2022; Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020; Costa, Maria Joao/M-4119-2013; Salgado, Rui/B-7588-2011; Costa, Maria João/M-4119-2013	Potes, Miguel/0000-0002-8912-5277; Costa, Maria Joao/0000-0003-2981-2232; Lagarde, Franck/0000-0002-3468-9593; Salgado, Rui/0000-0003-1311-6291; 														1600-0870					2013	65								20951	10.3402/tellusa.v65i0.20951	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v65i0.20951													WOS:000326510300001
J	Burnett, AW; Kirby, ME; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP				Burnett, AW; Kirby, ME; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP			Increasing Great Lake-effect snowfall during the twentieth century: A regional response to global warming?	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The influence of the Laurentian Great Lakes on the climate of surrounding regions is significant, especially in leeward settings where lake-effect snowfall occurs. Heavy lake-effect snow represents a potential natural hazard and plays important roles in winter recreational activities, agriculture, and regional hydrology. Changes in lake-effect snowfall may represent a regional-scale manifestation of hemispheric-scale climate change, such as that associated with global warming. This study examines records of snowfall from several lake-effect and non-lake-effect sites throughout most of the twentieth century in order to 1) determine whether differences in snowfall trends exist between these settings and 2) offer possible linkages between lake-effect snow trends and records of air temperature, water temperature, and ice cover. A new, historic record of oxygen isotope [delta(18)O((CaCO3))] data from the sediments of three eastern Finger Lakes in central New York is presented as a means of independently assessing changes in Great Lakes lake-effect snowfall. Results reveal a statistically significant increasing trend in snowfall for the lake-effect sites, whereas no trend is observed in the non-lake-effect settings. The Finger Lake oxygen isotope record reflects this increase in lake-effect snow through a statistically significant trend toward lower delta(18)O((CaCO3)) values. Records of air temperature, water temperature, and lake ice suggest that the observed lake-effect snow increase during the twentieth century may be the result of warmer Great Lakes surface waters and decreased ice cover, both of which are consistent with the historic upward trend in Northern Hemispheric temperature due to global warming. Given projected increases in future global temperature, areas downwind of the Great Lakes may experience increased lake-effect snowfall for the foreseeable future.

However, robust and consistent conclusions have been hampered by the complex processes controlling the dynamics and diverse interconnected linkage of the Asian monsoon. Here, we present a reconstruction of variations in humidity since AD 800, based on the ratio of hematite to goethite (Hem/Goe) and other magnetic parameters in the sediments of Baxian Lake, southern China. The record indicates that a dramatic transition from dry to humid climate occurred during AD 800-950 and then returned to extreme drought during the second half of the Medieval Warm Period. The fluctuations between a relatively wet climate and weak drought were also demonstrated during the Little Ice Age (AD 1450-1800). Climate-influenced vegetation coverage may influence the flux of weathered detrital magnetic minerals in sediments, as it hinders the input of coarser detritus into Baxian Lake. The magnetic minerals in the sediments were not significantly altered during the post-depositional processes. Additionally, the Hem/Goe record indicates that an opposite precipitation pattern occurred in southern China when compared with precipitation records in northern China and India. We ascribe this result to the superimposition of land-ocean-atmosphere dynamics on the traditional model of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) movement forced by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This is significant for enhancing our understanding of the relationship among the continent-ocean thermal gradient, ASM variation, ITCZ movement, El Nino Southern Oscillation-like events, and extreme climates in areas influenced by the ASM.					; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; Zhang, Tingwei/AAK-7302-2020	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Zhang, Tingwei/0000-0002-9839-4559; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2022	32	9					977	990	09596836221101250	10.1177/09596836221101250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221101250		JUN 2022											WOS:000810291800001

We applied a bifactorial multigeneration study in order to test if GCC conditions alter the effects of low pesticide concentrations on life history and genetic diversity of the aquatic model organism Chironomus riparius. Experimental populations of the species were chronically exposed to a low concentration of the fungicide pyrimethanil (half of the no-observed-adverse-effect concentration: NOAEC/2) under two dynamic present-day temperature simulations (11.0-22.7 degrees C; 14.0-25.2 degrees C) and one future scenario (16.5-28.1 degrees C). During the 140-day multigeneration study, survival, emergence, reproduction, population growth, and genetic diversity of C. riparius were analyzed. Our results reveal that high temperature and pyrimethanil act synergistically on the midge C. riparius. In simulated present-day scenarios, a NOAEC/2 of pyrimethanil as derived from a life-cycle toxicity test provoked only slight-to-moderate beneficial or adverse effects on C. riparius. In contrast, exposure to a NOAEC/2 concentration of pyrimethanil at a thermal situation likely for a summer under GCC conditions uncovered adverse effects on mortality and population growth rate. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably reduced by pyrimethanil in the future scenario, but only slightly under current climatic conditions. Our multigeneration study under near-natural (climatic) conditions indicates that not only the impact of climate change, but also low concentrations of pesticides may pose a reasonable risk for aquatic insects in future.

The water in these black pools was hypoxic, warmer, and more saline and sulfide rich than surrounding bottom water. These pools also contained high numbers of dead epibenthic species, including: shrimps, amphipods, mysids, bivalves, gastropods, sea cucumbers, and fishes. Infaunal abundance and biomass, as well as benthic chlorophyll concentrations, were significantly lower inside the black pools than in the surrounding sediments. The pools persisted until the first strong wind to occur after annual sea-ice break-up. A year later (July 1996), sulfide-rich black saline pools were again found in the same depressions as well as in new depressions formed by grounding ice during the previous summer. We hypothesize that the pools form annually, as the sea ice expels dense brine, which sinks and collects in previously formed ice gouge depressions on the shallow slopes of Resolute Bay. Benthic respiration would be sufficient to drive the stratified water in the pools to anoxia in the absence of currents and turnover, resulting in microbial production of highly toxic sulfides. Once established, the pools persist as lethal traps for benthic and demersal organisms until dispersed by wind or waves after breakup of the annual ice cover.																			0171-8630	1616-1599					1998	162						1	10		10.3354/meps162001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps162001													WOS:000072545600001

Excessive residues of mercury have recently been identified in various fish species of the lower Quachita River system in Arkansas. Fillets of mature largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) collected from Woodard Lake, an ox-bow lake of the Ouachita River, possessed muscle residues of mercury ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 ppm (mu g/g). To assess the usefulness of using MT expression as a biomarker of mercury exposure, livers and filets were obtained from feral bass of Woodard Lake. Ouachita served as a control site having mercury residues below detection. Analyses using a ribonuclease protection assay with winter flounder MT cDNA revealed that bass had significantly elevated levels of MT mRNA which correlated (r(2) = 0.756) with the levels of mercury in muscle fillets. To further explore the water quality of Woodard Lake, 10 juvenile channel catfish were housed in cages and placed where feral collections were made in both sites for 2 weeks. Mercury was not detected in muscle or liver and no significant difference in hepatic MT mRNA was observed. These data demonstrate that MT mRNA expression can be used as a tool to assess exposure to heavy metals and suggest that the elevated levels of mercury in large predatory fish may be due to trophic magnification rather than a single point-source exposure.

J	SELLARDS, EH				SELLARDS, EH			SOME EARLY STONE ARTIFACT DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTH-AMERICA	SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY												The 5 archaeologic sites referred to-Tule Springs, Lewisville, Santa Rosa, Scripps, and Texas Street[long dash]have certain characteristics in common. All of the sites for which radiocarbon dates have been obtained have shown evidence of great age; stone artifacts are of rare occurrence and in some sites no stone artifacts of any kind have been obtained; no projectile points have been found at any of the sites except Lewisville, where one point found is believed to be intrusive. It is not claimed that there are no projectile points of Pleistocene age. On the contrary, some projectile points, particularly Clovis fluted points, on the basis of stratigraphic position and faunal association, as at Blackwater, New Mexico, date back to late Pleistocene. Moreover, it is not improbable that there are some projectile points older than Clovis. A considerable number of sites, mostly in the western part of North America, are referable to Group II. Of these, two only are considered at this time[long dash]Manix Lake Lithic Industry, Manix Lake, California, and the Elongate-biface Artifact Assemblage as found in the Laguna Seca Chapala Basin site in the Baja California basin, Mexico. The artifacts found at the highest strand lines in the Chapala Basin site, the Elongate-biface Assemblage as defined by Arnold, are referred to Group II on the basis of their close resemblance to the artifacts of the Manix Lake Lithic Industry.																			0038-4801						1960	16	2					160	173		10.1086/soutjanth.16.2.3628813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/soutjanth.16.2.3628813													WOS:A1960CGT5200003

We tested the little-explored effects of small-scale environmental variation, genotypic composition (i.e. identity of genotypes) and genotypic diversity on the population survival of the regionally rare clonal plant Ranunculus reptans. For this species of periodically inundated lakeshores, genetic differentiation had been reported between populations and between short-flooded and long-flooded microsites within populations. Methods We established 306 experimental test populations at a previously unoccupied lakeshore, comprising either monocultures of 32 genotypes, mixtures of genotypes within populations or mixtures of genotypes between populations. In 2000, three years after planting out at the experimental site, a long-lasting flood caused the death of half of the experimental populations. In 2003, an extreme drought resulted in the lowest summer water levels ever measured. Important Findings Despite these climatic extremes, 27% of the established populations survived in December 2003. The success of experimental populations largely differed between microsites. Moreover, the success of genotype monocultures depended on genotype and source population. Genetic differentiation between microsites played a minor role for the success of reintroduction. After the flood, populations planted with genotypes from different source populations increased in abundance, whereas populations with genotypes from single source populations and genotype monocultures decreased. In 2014, several small patches of Ranunculus clones were still present, but plants were strongly intermingled, which precluded their assignment to the original treatments. We conclude that sources for reintroductions need to be selected carefully. Moreover, mixtures of plants from different populations appear to be the best choice for successful reintroduction, at least in unpredictably varying environments.

Early Holocene history of the west Greenland Ice Sheet and the GH-8.2 event	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet retreated rapidly during the first few thousand years of the Holocene. During this period of relative warmth, known as the Holocene thermal maximum, ice core records identify a significant short-lived cooling event at approximately 8.4-8.0 ka cal. yr BP (the 'GH-8.2 event') associated with a 5-7 degrees C fall in mean annual air temperature over the centre of the ice sheet. In this paper we constrain the history of the ice sheet margin in Disko Bugt (west Greenland) and that of a major ice stream, Jakobshavns Isbrae, during the early Holocene, which incorporates the interval of the GH-8.2 event. Our work is based on a new relative sea-level curve and minimum age estimates for the timing of deglaciation from two field sites, combined with a review of previously published research from the study area. We identify important differences in the chronology of ice margin recession during the early Holocene, most noticeably, the margin of Jakobshavns Isbrae retreated well inland of the adjacent ice sheet at this time. We conclude that the early Holocene 'Fjord Stade' moraines in Disko Bugt do not record a uniform ice sheet margin response to the GH-8.2 event. Rather, these moraines are diachronous and formed between c. 10-8 ka cal. yr BP, their age varying as a function of the interplay between topography and ice sheet/ice stream dynamics. We hypothesise that one cause for the lack of an identifiable response to the GH-8.2 event is because topographic controls dominated ice sheet behaviour at this time. In lowland areas, any increase in ice sheet mass balance was probably associated with an increase in calving rather than any major advance of a grounded ice sheet margin. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To better predict environmental change effects on ecosystems, particularly in critically sensitive regions such as high altitudes, it is imperative to recognise how their natural landscape heterogeneity works at different scales to shape habitats and sustain biotic communities prior to major changes. We conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high-altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems. Three composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained, they were (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics-responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for waterbody size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarising geology, slope and fractal order-all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and (iii) topography, that is, catchment formation type-driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. Although driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept. The findings inform on the relative contribution of scale-dependent catchment physical elements to lake ecotope and ecosystem formation in high-altitude lakes, which should be considered in any assessment of potentially major deleterious effects due to environmental/climate change.

The bulk mineralogy of the fluvial and lacustrine deposits comprises carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite, aragonite), clay minerals (smectite, illite, chlorite, mixed-layer clays S-C), nonclay silica minerals (quartz, feldspars, opal, cristobalite) and gypsum and anhydrite. The smectite, calcite, dolomite and gypsum are generally authigenic. The quartz, feldspar, illite, chlorite, detrital smectite probably derived from basement rocks. Major oxides and trace elements (SiO2, TiO2, Al(2)O3, Fe2O3, Cr, Ni, Co, Cu) are present in high amounts in the fluvial formations and the marginal lacustrine facies, and these are constituents of detritics transformed from the surrounding basement. The central facies of the lacustrine formations are rich in Ph, Ba, Rb, Sr, CaO and K2O and composed of authigenic limestone, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite. and smectite. The authigenic minerals are probably derivatives of the solutions solved from clastics and ash fall and moved towards the central zones of the lake increasing pH, Mg/Ca ratios and thus leading to the precipitation of the carbonate. The high Ba/Sr and Rb/Sr ratios in marginal lake facies; are related to the presence of small amounts of carbonates, which incorporated Sr.					AKKOCA, Dicle/V-9483-2018; Sağıroğlu, Ahmet/D-1933-2013	BAL AKKOCA, Dicle/0000-0002-6567-7739; 													1335-0552	1336-8052				DEC	2005	56	6					531	543																WOS:000235485400007

Over 200 m of diatomaceous mud and clay were deposited in the last 400,000 years, providing a continuous Middle and Late Quaternary lacustrine sequence for paleoenvironmental studies. The pollen record spans the last four glacial-interglacial cycles equivalent to Oxygen Isotope Stages (OIS) 10 to 1. During most of the glacial phases, Fagaceous monsoon forest was replaced by altitudinal vegetation, indicating a regional landscape transformation on the peninsula. The montane forest reached down to the lowland by at least 600 m during the OIS 6 and 8 in a cool and relatively wet condition, with temperature estimated to be more than 4 degrees C lower than present. A further lowering of the montane forest belts by about 800-1000 m occurred in the OIS 4-2, as implied by the appearance of many temperate elements. During the Last Glacial Maximum, this mixed forest subsequently gave way to the Poaceae grassland, a savanna vegetation type favored by drier and cooler climatic conditions. This drastic change implies a more significant drop in temperature and precipitation than the previous three glacial periods (OIS 10, 8 and 6). It is thus inferred that the weakening of summer monsoon was mon significant towards the end of the Late Pleistocene particularly during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Simulations of future changes in thermal structure of Lake Erken: proof of concept for ISIMIP2b lake sector local simulation strategy	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This paper, as a part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b), assesses the impacts of different levels of global warming on the thermal structure of Lake Erken (Sweden). The General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) one-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate water temperature when using ISIMIP2b bias-corrected climate model projections as input. These projections have a daily time step, while lake model simulations are often forced at hourly or shorter time steps. Therefore, it was necessary to first test the ability of GOTM to simulate Lake Erken water temperature using daily vs hourly meteorological forcing data. In order to do this, three data sets were used to force the model as follows: (1) hourly measured data, (2) daily average data derived from the first data set, and (3) synthetic hourly data created from the daily data set using generalised regression artificial neural network methods. This last data set is developed using a method that could also be applied to the daily time step ISIMIP scenarios to obtain hourly model input if needed. The lake model was shown to accurately simulate Lake Erken water temperature when forced with either daily or synthetic hourly data. Longterm simulations forced with daily or synthetic hourly meteorological data suggest that by the late 21st century the lake will undergo clear changes in thermal structure. For the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, namely RCP2.6, surface water temperature was projected to increase by 1.79 and 1.36 degrees C when the lake model was forced at daily and hourly resolutions respectively, and for RCP6.0 these increases were projected to be 3.08 and 2.31 degrees C. Changes in lake stability were projected to increase, and the stratification duration was projected to be longer by 13 and 11 d under RCP2.6 scenario and 22 and 18 d under RCP6.0 scenario for daily and hourly resolutions. Model changes in thermal indices were very similar when using either the daily or synthetic hourly forcing, suggesting that the original ISIMIP climate model projections at a daily time step can be sufficient for the purpose of simulating lake water temperature.

J	Veneranta, L; Hudd, R; Vanhatalo, J				Veneranta, Lari; Hudd, Richard; Vanhatalo, Jarno			Reproduction areas of sea-spawning coregonids reflect the environment in shallow coastal waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We evaluated the distribution and the extent of sea-spawning whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) s.l. and vendace Coregonus albula larval areas in the Gulf of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, and suggest that the distribution of the reproduction areas could be an indicator of the health of the Baltic Sea shores. Our Geographic Information System (GIS) based predictive spatial model of habitat selection covers nearly the whole distribution area of both species. Extensive sampling data on larval occurrence were combined with GIS raster layers on environmental variables and used in a Gaussian process model, which predicts the spatial probability of larval occurrence. Out of 22 studied variables, shore profile, distance to sandy shallow shore, distance to 20 m depth contour line and ice break-up week were the most important for describing larval areas of both species. The earliest larval stages of sea-spawning whitefish can be found in various habitats close to the shoreline, but the highest densities of larvae were observed along gently sloping, shallow sandy shores. Vendace reproduction occurs in the northernmost and less saline areas of the Bothnian Bay and larval stages use the shallow areas. Compared to previous studies from 1990s, the extent of whitefish larval areas has decreased. We discuss the possibility that long-term changes in the environment, such as more frequent iceless winters and increasing eutrophication, have reduced the reproductive success of sea-spawning coregonids. Larval distribution maps can be used to focus conservation measures in the most appropriate places. We propose to use this method as a monitoring tool, and produce maps to assist integrated coastal zone management and environmental protection					Vanhatalo, Jarno/H-4435-2012	Vanhatalo, Jarno/0000-0002-6831-0211													0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	477						231	+		10.3354/meps10169	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10169													WOS:000315953300019

These ecosystems are anticipated to be particularly sensitive to future changes in climate, and understanding how these systems have responded to climatic changes in the past can provide us with insights into their potential responses to future global change. In this study, the temporal dynamics of C-3-C-4 vegetation changes in response to changes in moisture availability, local fire events and changing levels of herbivory in a summer-rainfall region of Western India are reconstructed for the past-4600 cal yr BP. Paleodata such as stable carbon isotope of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)), oxygen isotope from carbonate shells (delta O-18(shell)), macro-charcoal and herbivore dung fungal spores are reported from the retrieved cores of two wetland sites located in the Banni grasslands of Western India. Results show that vegetation in the Banni was composed mostly of C-3 vegetation from-4600 to-2500 cal yr BP, after which there was a decline in C-3 vegetation. From the late-Holocene to the present, there was a mix of both C-3 and C-4 vegetation, with C-4 grasses being more abundant in the ecosystem. These shifts were coincident with rainfall changes from more mesic conditions during-4600 to-2500 cal yr BP to more arid conditions towards the present as indicated by delta O-18(shell) isotope data. The period of increase in C-4 vegetation also coincides with a period of increased biotic disturbances in the ecosystem, particularly fire. Given the current scenarios of global warming, recurrent drought events and increased anthropogenic use of similar ecosystems, such studies can provide us insights into potential future trajectories of these ecosystems.

Detrending modulates the intensity of the effect. AbstractTree-rings are the prime archive for high-resolution climate information over the past two millennia. However, the accuracy of annually resolved reconstructions from tree-rings can be constrained by what is known as climate signal age effects (CSAE), encompassing changes in the sensitivity of tree growth to climate over their lifespans. Here, we evaluate CSAE in Pinus uncinata from an upper tree line site in the Spanish central Pyrenees, Lake Gerber, which became a key location for reconstructing western Mediterranean summer temperatures at annual resolution. We use tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) measurements from 50 pine trees with individual ages ranging from 7 to 406 years. For MXD, temperature sensitivity increases significantly (p < 0.01) with tree age from r = 0.31 in juvenile rings with a cambial age < 100 years to r = 0.49 in adult rings > 100 years. Similar CSAE are not detected in TRW, likely affected by the overall lower temperature signal (rTRW = 0.45 vs. rMXD = 0.81 from 1951 to 2020). The severity of CSAE is influenced by the approach used to remove ontogenetic trends, highlighting the need to assess and consider potential biases during tree-ring standardization. Our findings reveal CSAE to add uncertainty in MXD-based climate reconstructions in the Mediterranean. We recommend studying CSAE by sampling diverse age classes in dendroclimatic field campaigns.					; Torbenson, Max/HWQ-5351-2023; Ziaco, Emanuele/ABB-4805-2020; Martinez del Castillo, Edurne/C-8956-2016; Tejedor, Ernesto/AAX-8547-2020; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013	Tejedor, Ernesto/0000-0001-6825-3870; Homfeld, Inga Kirsten/0000-0002-3965-8622; Torbenson, Max/0000-0003-2720-2238; Kunz, Marcel/0009-0001-7116-1114; Spelsberg, Sophie/0009-0001-3508-6356; Martinez del Castillo, Edurne/0000-0003-1542-2698; 													0931-1890	1432-2285				FEB	2025	39	1							23	10.1007/s00468-024-02598-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-024-02598-3								39830730					WOS:001398047200001

Virgilio; Viveiros, Fatima; Moreno, Lucia; Ferreira, Leticia; Coutinho, Rui			Hydrogeochemical evolution and characterization study in volcanic lakes of the Azores archipelago (Portugal)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A hydrogeochemical study was performed on 45 lakes spread across six islands of the Azores archipelago (Portugal). Water temperature of the studied lakes is cold (mean = 16.2 degrees C), and the deeper lakes depict a monomictic behaviour, with water column stratification during summer resulting in higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the hypolimnion. Samples present an acid to neutral pH (mean = 7.04), and in general correspond to diluted and weakly mineralized waters (mean electrical conductivity = 107 mu S/cm). The prevailing hydrogeochemical facies are of the Na-Cl type, which derives from atmospheric marine salts contamination, and, albeit not to the same extent, Na-HCO3, suggesting a cumulative effect of water-rock interaction. Water from Furna do Enxofre Lake exhibits a dissimilar Mg-HCO3 type. The neutralization of water acidity is promoted by water-rock interaction, which also leads to a bicarbonate enrichment in many lakes in the Azores. The HCO3- enrichment shows that other processes are controlling the water composition, such as the dissolution of CO2 from various origins, of which CO2-rich gas emissions from volcanic sources. A fraction of the emitted CO2 at Furna do Enxofre Lake (Graciosa) and Furnas Lake (on Sao Miguel) is of deep origin as showed by the delta C-13 content. In the remaining lakes, where these isotopic analyses (delta C-13) were carried out, the emitted CO2 has a biogenic origin, derived from the decomposition of organic matter and eutrophication, a process that affects several lakes in the Azores. The study of other stable isotopic contents (delta O-18 and delta H-2) allowed also the confirmation of the meteoric origin of studied waters. Excluding Furna do Enxofre lake, classified in class 5 (i.e. low activity lake), all lakes are classified as no activity (class 6).

Methods Using data from a cohort of HIV-positive individuals aged 13-49 years, enrolled from 5 fishing communities on Lake Victoria between 2009-2011, we sought to identify factors contributing to the epidemic and to understand the underlying structure of HIV transmission networks. Clinical and socio-demographic data were combined with HIV-1 phylogenetic analyses. HIV-1 gag-p24 and env-gp-41 sub-genomic fragments were amplified and sequenced from 283 HIV-1-infected participants. Phylogenetic clusters with >= 2 highly related sequences were defined as transmission clusters. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with clustering. Results Altogether, 24% (n = 67/283) of HIV positive individuals with sequences fell within 34 phylogenetically distinct clusters in at least one gene region (either gag or env). Of these, 83% occurred either within households or within community; 8/34 (24%) occurred within household partnerships, and 20/34 (59%) within community. 7/12 couples (58%) within households clustered together. Individuals in clusters with potential recent transmission (11/34) were more likely to be younger 71% (15/21) versus 46% (21/46) in un-clustered individuals and had recently become resident in the community 67% (14/21) vs 48% (22/46). Four of 11 (36%) potential transmission clusters included incident-incident transmissions. Independently, clustering was less likely in HIV subtype D (adjusted Odds Ratio, aOR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.26-1.00]) than A and more likely in those living with an HIV-infected individual in the household (aOR = 6.30 [95% CI 3.40-11.68]). Conclusions A large proportion of HIV sexual transmissions occur within house-holds and within communities even in this key mobile population. The findings suggest localized HIV transmissions and hence a potential benefit for the test and treat approach even at a community level, coupled with intensified HIV counselling to identify early infections.

A review of the aquatic mollusca from Lake Pamvotis, Ioannina, an ancient lake in NW Greece	JOURNAL OF CONCHOLOGY												Lake Pamvotis (=Lake Ioannina) is an ancient lake in NW Greece famous for its long geological record, which has furnished some of the most detailed Quaternary palaeoclimate records from Europe. Unlike some other Balkan lakes, which exhibit spectacular faunal radiations, Lake Pamvotis (and its surrounding habitats) supports just two (but maybe up to five) endemic gastropods but is the type locality for two other valid species of aquatic molluscs and for two taxa now regarded as junior synonyms. It was also an important locality where Schlafli collected specimens later described by Mousson in 1859. These shells, now in Zarich Museum, have been revised as part of a new study of the aquaticfauna of the lake. Four species represented in this collection are not otherwise known from Greece, raising the suspicion that shells from different localities have become mixed. The status of a further two species, known elsewhere in Greece, remains unclear since they have not been re-discovered at Ioannina. A systematic review is given of the 29 species of gastropod and 8 species of bivalve now known from Lake Pamvotis and its surrounding marshlands and springs. Trichonia trichonica is reported from only its second known site and Pisidium obtusale and Gyraulus cf. piscinarum are recorded from Greece for the first time. Illustrations of critical taxa are presented. Planorbis janinensis is transferred to the genus Gyraulus. Eight species of mollusc have been recovered from Holocene sediments beneath the lake; the records for four of these can be traced back to at least 200,000 years. Dreissena stankovici seems to have been present at Ioannina throughout the Quaternary.

BP Finse event, between 8420 and 7880 cal. BP. The glacier has existed continuously from 4700 cal. BP to the present, reaching its maximum extension around AD 1840 according to lichenometric dates, Single minerogenic particles >1 mm in the sediments retrieved from Groningstolsvatnet are interpreted as dropstones from dirty snow-avalanches eroding the valley sides and deposited on the frozen lake. A local snow-avalanche chronology has been constructed for the last 10000 calendar years, based on the distribution of dropstones in the cores, with pronounced snow-avalanche activity peaking around 10 100 and 8600 cal. BP. This was at a minimum during the period when there were no glaciers in the lake catchment between similar to7800 and 4700 cal. BP, but increased somewhat around 7100 and 7400 cal. BP. Other marked snow-avalanche episodes occurred around 4000. 3000, 1900 and 1300 cal. BP, and during the recent decades. The snow-avalanche record is largely in accordance with similar records from western Norway and also with a winter-precipitation curve reconstructed from the Jostedalsbreen region.																			0959-6836						2002	12	2					211	222		10.1191/0959683602hl536rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl536rp													WOS:000174308000009

Deer Florivory Is Associated with Changes in Clonal Structure of the Woodland Plant Bluebead Lily	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Premise of research. Many plant species balance resource allocation between sexual and asexual reproduction. Ecological factors that alter this balance can have important effects on plant populations. By eliminating flowers, floral herbivory (florivory) reduces sexual reproduction and consequently shifts reproductive allocation toward asexual reproduction. Over time, the clonal structure of the population may change. To investigate long-term effects of florivory, we characterized clonal structure in patches of the woodland herb Clintonia borealis (Liliaceae), or the bluebead lily. Methodology. A common understory species of North American boreal forests, bluebead lily is a favorite spring food of Odocoileus virginianus, or white-tailed deer. We sampled patches of bluebead lily located on islands in the Great Lakes, which either had or did not have white-tailed deer. Genotyping using newly developed microsatellite markers allowed clones to be identified. Pivotal results. The clonal structure, measured as the genet-to-ramet ratio (G : N) of a patch, averaged 0.104 genets per ramet on islands with deer, compared with 0.458 genets per ramet on islands without deer. The difference was significant, based on a linear mixed effects model (Delta AICc=3.94, Akaike weight = 0.878), and the effect size, as measured by Cohen's d was 1.995. We also observed significantly lower clonal diversity and clonal evenness on islands with deer, which in turn could further limit sexual reproduction due to self-sterility or inbreeding. Conclusions. While the effects of white-tailed deer on plant community structure have been well documented, our results suggest that they may also have significant effects on the reproductive dynamics of individual plant species.																			1058-5893	1537-5315				JUN 1	2019	180	5					357	365		10.1086/702861	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/702861													WOS:000468814300001

We used three different types of sieved sediment: pre-frozen muddy clay, non-pre-frozen muddy clay, and fine sand. The muddy clay contained phytoplankton originating from the surface sediment sampled in the field during the late spring bloom. No phytoplankton was initially present in sand. The experiment lasted for 18 days. M. affinis responded to the daily phytoplankton addition by increasing growth. Phytoplankton addition had no significant effects on the survival of M. affinis. Upon phytoplankton addition, the sandy and non-frozen muddy clay gave similar growth and survival responses. In contrast, the pre-frozen sediment resulted in significantly lower growth and survival. The growth was negative in all treatments without phytoplankton. Thus, the high initial chlorophyll content in the muddy clay was not of sufficient quality or concentration to allow a positive growth response in M. affinis. The growth of M. affinis was significantly correlated with the reduction of the chlorophyll. Our results indicated that M. affinis is capable of assimilating settled phytoplankton with no, or only a few days' time delay.

J	PUGSLEY, C				PUGSLEY, C			ECOLOGY OF THE NEW-ZEALAND GLOWWORM, ARACHNOCAMPA-LUMINOSA (DIPTERA, KEROPLATIDAE), IN THE GLOWWORM CAVE, WAITOMO	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND												The temperature and relative humidity inside the Glowworm Cave are spatially and temporally variable to a degree atypical of other caves in temperate latitudes. Comparison between the climatic data for 1977-1980 and for 1955 shows that the climate of the cave was much more stable in 1955 than it is at present. The increase in climatic variability probably is closely related to the fact that since 1975, when the Upper Entrance was unblocked, the cave has behaved as a wind tunnel: the difference in density between the atmosphere inside and outside the cave allows the outside air to flow freely through the interior between the Upper and Lower Entrances. Climatic fluctuations are considered to be the main factor responsible for the decline in the total population of A. luminosa (Skuse) observed between 1975-1980. Climatic changes may also explain why the numbers and diversity of other cave fauna are low. A. luminosa has 5 larval instars. Larval development is hemodynamic; the majority of the population follows a distinct annual cycle, in which most larvae hatch in spring. The distribution of glowworm larvae in the cave is largely determined by food supply and climatic conditions. The main source of food is the insects that emerge from the Waitomo Stream as it flows through the cave lakes. The main causes of mortality of glowworm larvae are cannibalism, an entomogenous fungus, cave opiliones, desiccation and flooding.																			0303-6758	1175-8899					1984	14	4					387	407		10.1080/03036758.1984.10421739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03036758.1984.10421739													WOS:A1984TZ31200008

Gastric evacuation and daily ration of naturally produced age-0 Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Almost 30 years after natural reproduction of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha was discovered in Lake Ontario tributaries, little is known about the feeding dynamics of these fish after they enter the lake. This study assesses consumption by naturally produced age-0 Chinook salmon as they enter the nearshore region of Lake Ontario after emigrating from the Salmon River. New York, a major U.S. tributary of Lake Ontario. Evacuation rate, estimated as a function of temperature in controlled laboratory experiments, ranged from 0.214/h at 10 degrees C to 0.352/h at 19 degrees C. Diet field sampling for daily ration estimates occurred on three dates in late spring (June 6, 12, and 18, 200 1). Although no consistent diel feeding pattern was observed, Chinook salmon maintained an elevated gut fullness value throughout the day and did not feed after dark. Moreover, daily rations (grams [dry weight] of ration per 100 g of dry fish weight), which ranged from 27.54 (SE = 3.07) on June 12 to 33.27 (3.7) on June 6, were high compared with the values obtained in similar studies. Comparisons of daily ration estimates with bioenergetics model estimates showed that juvenile Chinook salmon were consuming prey at or above their maximum estimated daily ration. Daily ring counts of sagittal otoliths confirmed that the Chinook salmon in this investigation were naturally produced. Our results indicate that current food conditions in the nearshore waters of Lake Ontario are suitable for sustaining maximum consumption rates by naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon that have recently migrated into the lake from spawning tributaries.																			0002-8487					SEP	2007	136	5					1206	1215		10.1577/T06-125.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-125.1													WOS:000250184600005

Intersex and reproductive impairment of wild fish exposed to multiple municipal wastewater discharges	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The Grand River watershed in Ontario, Canada, receives and assimilates the outflow of 29 Municipal Wastewater Effluent (MWWE) discharges which is a mixture of domestic and industrial wastes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cumulative impact of multiple sewage discharges on populations of wild fish. In field studies, responses of fish populations and individual fish responses in terms of growth (condition factor), reproduction (in vitro sex steroid production, gonadosomatic indices, histology [cellular development and intersex] were assessed upstream and downstream of two municipal discharges. Fish [Greenside Darters Etheostoma blennioides and Rainbow Darters E. caeruleum] collected downstream of two municipal wastewater plants had the potential to have greater growth (longer and heavier) when compared to reference fish collections regardless of sex. Fish were not assimilating additional anthropogenic resources into energy storage (increased condition, liver somatic index). Impacts on ovarian development appeared to be minor with no differences in growth, steroid production or cellular development. Sewage exposed male fish were experiencing impairment in the capacity to produce testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone in vitro, and in cellular development (GSI, intersex). Male darters of both species collected in the upstream agricultural region demonstrated no evidence of intersex whereas our urban reference sites had incidence of intersex of up to 20%. Rates of intersex were elevated downstream of both sewage discharges studied (33% and>60%, respectively). Lower rates of intersex at the intermediate sites, and then increases downstream of second sewage discharge suggests that fish populations have to potential to recover prior to exposure to the second sewage effluent. Pre-spawning darters demonstrated dramatically higher incidence of intersex in the spring at both urban reference sites (33% and 50%, respectively), and increased more so downstream of the near-field and far-field exposure sites (60% and 100%, respectively). These findings suggest that the compounds released in SIP effluents have a tendency to act on the male reproductive system. These effects may become more pronounced as projected human population growth will require the aquatic environment to assimilate an increasing amount of sewage waste.

Apparent predation of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by prickly sculpins (Cottus asper) is an artefact of trapping methodology	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Freshwater sculpins often inhabit the same waterways as juvenile salmonids and may impact the survival of juvenile salmonids through predation on early life-history stages. In the present study, the stomach contents of 2302 individual Cottus asper, a freshwater sculpin, collected from Auke Lake, Alaska, were examined during the boreal summer of 2000 to determine if C. asper are important natural predators of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and to explore possible trap bias of gear used in preliminary diet studies. The diet of sculpins collected in confining traps was compared with the diet of sculpins collected in nets. Significant predation on pre-smolt coho salmon by trapped sculpins, but none by netted sculpins, was observed. This result provides strong evidence of trap bias in the observed diet of C. asper. The remainder of the diet of trapped sculpins also differed significantly from that of netted sculpins. Significantly more trapped sculpins had eaten plant material and fish, whereas significantly more netted sculpins had consumed molluscs. Finally, sculpin diet was correlated with sculpin size, which may influence predation on other salmonid life-stages. These results expand our understanding of prickly sculpin diet and show that they are not important predators of juvenile coho salmon. These findings also demonstrate the importance of assessing the potential bias of collection gear and sampling techniques.																			1323-1650						2006	57	5					513	518		10.1071/MF05186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF05186													WOS:000239077200005

In addition to the persistence of the water column, this approach can be used to analyze changes in the morphology of saline accumulations and persistence of snow or ice; for example, for establishing variable plant cover over time and evaluating the microbiota associated with soils with seasonal changes in plants. The lacustrine systems of La Brava and La Punta, located in the Tilopozo sector in the extreme south of Salar de Atacama, are pristine high-altitude Andean lakes found along the central Andes of South America. This shallow ecosystem suffers from permanent evaporation, leading to falling water levels, causing it to recede or disappear during the dry season. This dynamic causes physicochemical changes in lakes, such as low nutrient availability, pH change, and dissolved metals, which can influence the composition of the microbial community. In this study, we used a metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA hypervariable regions V3 to V4) to characterize the sedimentary microbiota of these lakes. To understand how the water column affects and is structured in the microbiota of these lakes, we combined the analysis of the persistence of the water column through satellite images and physicochemical characterization. Our results show a significant difference in abiotic factors and microbiota composition between La Punta and La Brava lakes. In addition, microbiota analysis revealed compositional changes in the ecological disaggregation (main and isolated bodies) and antagonistic changes in the abundance of certain taxa between lakes. These findings are an invaluable resource for understanding the microbiological diversity of high Andean lakes using a multidisciplinary approach that evaluates the microbiota behavior in response to abiotic factors.IMPORTANCE In this study, we analyzed the persistence of the water column through satellite images and physicochemical characterization to investigate the composition and diversity in High Andean Lake Systems in a hyperarid environment. In addition to the persistence of the water column, this approach can be used to analyze changes in the morphology of saline accumulations and persistence of snow or ice; for example, for establishing variable plant cover over time and evaluating the microbiota associated with soils with seasonal changes in plants. This makes it an ideal approach to search for novel extremophilic microorganisms with unique properties. In our case, it was used to study microorganisms capable of resisting desiccation and water restriction for a considerable period and adapting to survive in ecological niches, such as those with high UV irradiation, extreme drought, and high salt concentration.					; Ramos-Tapia, Ignacio/HTO-9906-2023; Paneque, Manuel/A-6930-2015; Soto, Jorge/JXW-5802-2024	nunez salazar, reynaldo/0000-0001-5634-1144; Soto Winckler, Jorge/0000-0003-3000-3571; Ramos-Tapia, Ignacio/0000-0001-9840-3331; Paneque, Manuel/0000-0002-8731-0233; Cortez, Donna/0000-0003-1897-392X; 														2165-0497				JUN	2023	11	3								10.1128/spectrum.05200-22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.05200-22		APR 2023						37102964					WOS:000975654700001

New results from chironomid, isotopic, palacomagnetic and geochemical data analyses were correlated with earlier evidence of lithological and palynological changes in the Kamyshovoye Lake record. The section of the record that was studied covered the interval between 15 200 and 6500 cal. a BP Palaeoclimatic reconstructions showed that during the Younger Dryas there was a two-step decrease in the mean July temperature. The temperature dropped by 3 degrees C in the period from similar to 12 650 to 12 300 cal. a BP. and then it dropped by another 0.5 degrees C to a minimum of 11.5 degrees Cat 11 900 cal. a BP. During the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition. a temperature increase of 3 degrees C can be seen over a period of several centuries, inferred from the chironomid data. Further, the temperature curve showed that significant fluctuations continued until similar to 9500 cal. a BP. During the coolings, the average July temperature dropped to values that were typical for the Younger Dryas, while values characteristic for the Allerod were only reached at around 9700 cal. a BR. After 9500 cal. a BP, a more stable, gradual increase in temperature was recorded. The short-term Early Holocene climatic oscillations are clearly traced in the Kamyshovoye sequence, although the responses of the natural components are sometimes asynchronous. In the case of the Kamyshovoye study, the geochemical data seem to be a sensitive indicator of the climatic and environmental changes despite the absence of an evident response to the Holocene onset at similar to 11 700 cal. a BR Considerable changes in the geochemical pattern are recorded later, at similar to 11 500 cal. a BP, coinciding with noticeable changes in the development of vegetation. The results obtained in this study contribute to a deeper understanding of how global climatic trends are manifested on a local scale.					; Subetto, Dmitry/A-4467-2014; Skipityte, Raminta/MIK-6156-2025; Syrykh, Liudmila/K-8331-2018; Nazarova, Larisa/C-8926-2014; Druzhinina, Olga/ABB-1504-2020; Gedminiene, Laura/NGS-6202-2025; Stancikaite, Migle/MTG-2867-2025; Kulkova, Marianna/M-2974-2013	Kublitskiy, Yuriy/0000-0001-7955-8944; Stancikaite, Migle/0000-0001-9425-5634; Syrykh, Liudmila/0000-0003-2076-8570; Vaikutiene, Giedre/0009-0008-5342-4700; Nazarova, Larisa/0000-0003-4145-9689; Druzhinina, Olga/0000-0003-4326-6792; Kulkova, Marianna/0000-0001-9946-8751													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2020	49	3					544	561		10.1111/bor.12438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12438		JUL 2020											WOS:000547169300001

Vandenberg (1980) extended Toth (1962) by deriving a transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a unit basin and examined the flow field distortion under different dimensionless response time, tau*. Following Vandenberg's (1980) approach, we extended Toth (1963) by deriving the transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a complex basin and examined the transient behavior of nested flow systems. Due to the effect of specific storage, the flow field is asymmetric with respect to the midline, and the trajectory of internal stagnation points constitutes a non-enclosed loop, whose width decreases when tau* decreases. The distribution of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation, Delta h*, is dependent on the horizontal distance away from a divide and the depth below the land surface. In the shallow part, Delta h* decreases from 1 at the divide to 0 at its neighboring valley under all tau*, while in the deep part, Delta h* reaches a threshold, whose value decreases when tau* increases. The zones with flowing wells are also found to change periodically. As water table falls, there is a general trend of shrinkage in the area of zones with flowing wells, which has a lag to the declining water table under a large tau*. Although fluxes have not been assigned in our model, the recharge/discharge flux across the top boundary can be obtained. This study is critical to understand a series of periodically changing hydrogeological phenomena in large-scale basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Halla. The volcanic island and its lava tubes were added to the world heritage list by UNESCO in 2007. Among the many lava tubes on the island, a unique cave had been accidentally found in 2005 while some workers were replacing a telephone pole. Until the discovery, it had been completely isolated from the outside by naturally-built sand blocks. Yongcheon cave is a lime-decorated lava tube showing both the properties of a volcanic lava tube and a limestone cave. This cave, about 3 km in length, is acknowledged to be the best of this type in the world and includes a large clean-water lake, lava falls, and richly developed speleothems inside it. Even though there is archaeological evidence from well preserved pottery that ancient people entered this place, the preservation of artifacts was ensured by a geological change that made later entrance difficult. We have collected charcoal samples scattered around the cave and dated them using AMS. Ages were in the range of ca. 1570-1260 BP (A.D. 340-880) and this corresponds to the Ancient Three Kingdoms and the Unified Silla era in Korean history. The C-14 AMS measurement results presented in this paper on wood charcoal provide precise dates which will be very useful not only to clarify the nature of human activities in this cave but also to provide reference dates when comparing other dating methods.

J	Dech, JP; Maun, MA; Pazner, MI				Dech, JP; Maun, MA; Pazner, MI			Blowout dynamics on Lake Huron sand dunes: analysis of digital multispectral data from colour air photos	CATENA												We adapted a digital image analysis procedure to extract multispectral data from sequential colour air photos of a Lake Huron sand dune system and then classify land cover into water, sand, and vegetation. We isolated portions containing individual blowouts from georeferenced land cover maps of the dune system in 1973 and 1998 and overlaid the sequential images using geographic information systems (GIS). This allowed us to quantify changes in blowouts over the 25-year period. Net change in land cover (m 2) within each blowout was expressed as the difference between retrogression (bare areas created by erosion or burial of existing vegetation) and colonization (vegetation patches created by plant establishment on bare areas). The analysis procedure produced maps with an overall accuracy of greater than or equal to90% for land cover classification within blowouts. The individual blowouts fell along a continuum of activity, varying from significant retrogression (+748 m(2)) to significant colonization (- 1148 m(2)). Overall, sand movement in all sampled blowouts produced 3991 m(2) (17.9% of the blowout area in 1998) of bare sand patches that replaced formerly existing patches of vegetation. Colonization of bare areas over the 25-year period was 4127 m(2) or 18.5% of the 1998 blowout area.

In this study, we sampled and investigated natural waters from 23 sites (involving the crater lake, hot springs, streams, rivers, and bubbling pools) in two campaigns in 2017 and 2018, using physicochemical parameters, major, trace and rare-earth elements concentrations. With this novel dataset, it was possible to identify, characterize and compare three groups of waters with distinctive hydrofacies. Indeed, the normalization of water compositions against host rock concentrations showed a particular trace element pattern for each group of waters. Although the absolute concentrations of the elements in each sampling site changed from 2017 to 2018, the normalized patterns did not. Boron, As, Cd, Tl, Se, and Te, commonly recognized as volatile, are the main trace elements that magmatic gases supply to the system headwaters, whereas elements such as Ca, K, and Ba are affected by precipitation of secondary minerals (gypsum, anhydrite, barite, jarosite, and alunite). Furthermore, the main river draining the summit volcano shows a steep decrease in As, Cr, and V concentrations correlated to the precipitation of Fe and Al hydroxysulfates (schwertmannite and basaluminite, respectively). Moreover, it is the first time that a comparison between the different water groups is made using the patterns of the rare-earth elements, allowing us to identify and separate depletion patterns due to dilution processes from those due to precipitation processes.					; Sierra, Daniel/C-6252-2009; D'Alessandro, Walter/GQB-3978-2022; Calabrese, Sergio/H-9033-2013	Lamberti, Maria Clara/0000-0001-5386-3000; Li Vigni, Lorenza/0000-0002-1223-6737; Brugnone, Filippo/0000-0003-3852-3467; Garcia, Sebastian Esteban/0000-0002-9528-3634; Agusto, Mariano/0000-0001-6037-8492; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				SEP 20	2023	634								121602	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121602		JUL 2023											WOS:001031875000001

Effects of chemical pretreatments on δ18O measurements, chemical composition, and morphology of chironomid head capsules	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stable oxygen isotope measurements on fossil chironomid head capsules from lake sediments show that these chitinous remains can be used to reconstruct past lake water delta O-18 and, indirectly, past climate change. We examined the impact of chemical pretreatment procedures on the chemical and stable oxygen isotope composition, and morphology of chironomid cuticles. Use of alkali, acids, and sodium chlorite alters the chemical composition and the morphological structure of chironomid cuticles by selective removal of chitin or proteins. Gas chromatograms of pyrolyzates show that NaClO2 causes deproteination, whereas the combined use of HCl and HF results in partial chitin removal. Head capsules pretreated with KOH contained both chitin- and protein-derived moieties, although the concentration of protein was reduced, especially after KOH treatment at high concentration (28%) and temperature (100A degrees C). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that a proteinaceous matrix is still present in modern and fossil head capsules after KOH treatment. This matrix, however, is largely absent in head capsules pretreated with NaClO2. A change in the proportion of chitin and proteins in our samples was associated with differences in chironomid delta O-18 values. Our results suggest that deproteination results in a relative increase of chironomid delta O-18, whereas removal of chitin leads to decreased delta O-18 values. We therefore discourage the use of acids or prolonged (a parts per thousand yen1 h) exposure to hot alkali (70A degrees C) prior to chironomid delta O-18 analysis. Chitin purification by sodium chlorite causes significant weight loss, which may preclude down-core chironomid delta O-18 measurements. Caution and standardization are required when pretreating samples for chironomid delta O-18 analysis to ensure reliable, comparable, and reproducible results.					; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008; Reichart, Gert-Jan/N-6308-2018; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; de Leeuw, Jan/F-6471-2011	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; Verbruggen, Frederike/0000-0001-6642-8171; Reichart, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-7256-2243; Nierop, Klaas G.J./0000-0002-4482-6109; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2010	43	4					857	872		10.1007/s10933-009-9374-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-009-9374-z													WOS:000276481300016

SPECIES-INDIVIDUAL LEVEL	ACTA BOTANICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												The Shannon measure of species diversity of the plankton algae approaches its possible maximum (log2s) to a smaller extent in a more eutrophic lake than in a less eutrophic one. Also its absolute size is smaller. In a considerable part of the year, diversity is determined by the species number (r2 = 0.5089), which on the other hand is highly correlated with the duration of sunlight (r = +0.7134 P < 0. Y = 5.8912 + 0.1810X), but lower with insolation (r = 0.6161 P < 1%). In a smaller part of the year, evenness plays a dominant part in the changing of diversity, if .epsilon. < 0.2. This period falls to the time of the alga-maximum and the nutrient limitation accompanying it. The selective inhibiting influence of the blue-green algae, which proliferate at that time of year and decrease the evenness, is also presumable. The average species number is higher, the average evenness is lower in a more eutrophic lake and both tendencies take a stronger course in the period of higher number of algae (above 100 millions of individuals per l). The Margalef index is correlated with the Shannon index. The parameters calculated with a higher accuracy (H, R, J) did not provide considerably better results, since the algal data counted by means of the traditional algological method provided a false statistical accuracy. The results are demonstrated in a new-type column diagram.																			0001-5350						1977	23	1-2					77	90																WOS:A1977EN99000006

Measurements of the levels of mercury in edible muscle of northern fish have been undertaken for over three decades in efforts to evaluate the risks of consuming northern fish. This report summarizes the data obtained from 7974 fish of 25 species from sites distributed from the Yukon to Labrador. The most abundant species were lake trout, lake whitefish, arctic char, walleye, northern pike and burbot. The question being asked was essentially "Are the fish safe to eat?" The results were used to support decisions on fishing and consumption of fish. They were sorted in several ways, into concentration ranges corresponding to human consumption guidelines, into political jurisdictions and into types of bedrock geology. Overall walleye, northern pike and lake trout, usually exceeded the subsistence consumption guideline of 0.2 mu g g(-1) total mercury and often exceeded the higher guideline of 0.5 mu g g(-1) total mercury for commercial sales of fish. Mercury in burbot, another facultative predator, was often lower but several still exceeding a guideline. Arctic char collections were mostly from anadromous populations and these had very low levels of mercury, presumably reflecting marine food sources. Lake whitefish were among the cleanest fish examined with 69 of 81 collections falling in the lowest range. Most collections were from sites in sedimentary rock. However a few sites were in metamorphic, intrusive or volcanic rocks and these, taken together, tended to have a higher proportion of sites in the higher ranges of mercury. These results indicate a widespread problem with mercury in subsistence fisheries for predator species of fish with the problem being most problematic for Nunavut.

J	Wilkins, AD; Hurst, A; Wilson, MJ; Archer, S				Wilkins, Anne D.; Hurst, Andrew; Wilson, Michael J.; Archer, Stuart			Palaeo-environment in an ancient low-latitude, arid lacustrine basin with loessite: The Smith Bank Formation (Early Triassic) in the Central North Sea, UK Continental Shelf	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Predominantly fine-grained strata were deposited in the Smith Bank Formation (Early Triassic) in the Central North Sea area of the Northern Permian Basin. Previously regarded as monotonous red claystone, examination of continuous core reveals abundant stratification, significant variation in colour, siltstone as the prevalent average grain size, and claystone is rare. Loessite occurs beyond the north-western lacustrine margin, and aerosol dust has inundated clay pellets derived from aeolian reworking of the desiccated lake floor. The loessite has limited evidence of pluvial reworking but rare fossil roots testify to sufficient moisture to sustain plants. Loessite has not previously been differentiated successfully from other fine-grained strata in the subsurface, but this study defines the presence of random grain-fabric orientation as an intrinsic unequivocal characteristic of loessite that formed during air-fall deposition of aerosol dust. Comparison with outcrop data verifies the utility of grain fabric to differentiate loessite. Tosudite, an aluminous di-octahedral regularly ordered mixed-layer chlorite/smectite, which is rare in sedimentary rock, forms a significant proportion (10 to 21%) of the clay mineral fraction of loessite along with a similar quantity of kaolinite. In all other samples, only illite and chlorite are identified, which is typical of fine-grained Triassic strata. In a location, close to the southern lake margin, lacustrine strata are characterized by fining-upward couplets of very fine-grained sandstone into siltstone and mudstone, with occasional desiccated surfaces. Small sand injections and associated sand extrusions are common and indicate periodic fluidization of sand. Precise stratigraphic location of the Smith Bank Formation is problematic because of extremely sparse fossil preservation; however, there is no sedimentological evidence for a period of hyperaridity known from the early Olenekian in continental Europe, which may mean that the North Permian Basin was never hyperarid or that the Smith Bank Formation is restricted to the Induan.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			When barley straw and deciduous leaf litter decompose aerobically in water, inhibitors are released that suppress the growth of nuisance algae. Barley straw has been widely used for algal control in small, shallow lakes and we review the advantages and disadvantages of the method. It is particularly effective at promoting the switch from algal to macrophyte domination. Despite its cheapness and apparent safety in the short term, however, the use of barley straw requires considerable management effort and the long-term ecological safety of such un-natural litter inputs is unkown. We therefore recommend it to lake managers primarily as a short-term measure. Deciduous leaf litter from a range of woody species can suppress the growth of Chlorella and Microcystis very effectively in laboratory bioassays and, in field trials with medium-sized ponds, the addition of leaf litter produced significant inhibition of the filamentous alga Cladophora glomerata. We followed the development of algal inhibitory activity over 2.5 years with freshly fallen oak leaves placed in a large tank of aerated water and using Chlorella as the test species. Two periods of inhibitor release were identified: 4-90 days (early phase) when soluble, relatively stable inhibitors were present in tank liquor, probably generated from oxidized tannins; and 120-900+ days (late phase) when inhibitors were relatively unstable in solution and were associated primarily with fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). Late phase inhibitors may, as suggested for barley straw, be generated during the oxidative breakdown of lignin. The prolonged and powerful anti-algal properties of these natual litter inputs offer possibilities for low-effort, sustainable management of lakes and catchments so as to reduce the problem excessive algal growth.

We undertook autocalibration of the one-dimensional hydrodynamicecological lake model DYRESM-CAEDYM, using a Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) method, in order to test the applicability of this procedure for shallow, polymictic Lake Rotorua (New Zealand). The calibration procedure involved independently minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE), maximizing the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficient coefficient (Nr) for comparisons of model state variables against measured data. An assigned number of parameter permutations was used for 10 000 simulation iterations. The "optimal" temperature calibration produced a RMSE of 0.54 degrees C, Nr value of 0.99, and r value of 0.98 through the whole water column based on comparisons with 540 observed water temperatures collected between 13 July 2007 and 13 January 2009. The modeled bottom dissolved oxygen concentration (20.5 m below surface) was compared with 467 available observations. The calculated RMSE of the simulations compared with the measurements was 1.78 mg L-1, the Nr value was 0.75, and the r value was 0.87. The autocalibrated model was further tested for an independent data set by simulating bottom-water hypoxia events from 15 January 2009 to 8 June 2011 (875 days). This verification produced an accurate simulation of five hypoxic events corresponding to DO < 2 mg L-1 during summer of 2009-2011. The RMSE was 2.07 mg L-1, Nr value 0.62, and r value of 0.81, based on the available data set of 738 days. The autocalibration software of DYRESM-CAEDYM developed here is substantially less time-consuming and more efficient in parameter optimization than traditional manual calibration which has been the standard tool practiced for similar complex water quality models.

Fluctuation in leaf wax D/H ratio from a southern California lake records significant variability in isotopes in precipitation during the late Holocene	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The hydrogenisotopic composition of plant molecular markers in modern vegetation and marine sediments in southern California have been intensively studied. Here we report a late Holocene reconstruction from Zaca Lake in coastal southern California, together with modern hydrological and vegetation studies in the catchment. The small catchment and decadal sampling resolution throughout the 9 m, 3000 yr sedimentary record provided a high resolution terrigenous counterpart of nearby marine records from the Santa Barbara Basin. Today, delta D values of precipitation average -51.5 parts per thousand +/- 18 (1 sigma, n = 7). Modern plant leaf wax delta D values for the C-28 n-alkanoic acid averaged -141 parts per thousand +/- 11(1 sigma, n = 10) for Quercus agrifolia, with a calculated fractionation relative to precipitation (epsilon(wax/precip)) of -94 parts per thousand +/- 22(1 sigma, n = 10); in contrast, therewas negligible production of the C-28 acid by co-dominant Pinus coulteri. Downcore, the C-28 acid delta D values ranged between -101 parts per thousand and -177 parts per thousand (mean -150 parts per thousand +/- 8, 1 sigma, n = 490). Abundance distributions suggested that the sedimentary C-28 acid was dominated by Quercus, implying that paleoprecipitation varied between extremes of -8 parts per thousand and -92 parts per thousand (mean -63 parts per thousand +/- 14, compound 1 sigma, n = 490). The 3000 yr leaf wax D/H record from Zaca Lake revealed substantial temporal variability, greater than observed in a speleothem reconstruction of similar resolution. We suggest that the plant-based proxy may magnify the variability by sampling spring precipitation preferentially. Centennial-duration positive isotopic excursions were associated with more sub-tropical moisture sources and drier conditions including during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and negative excursions were associated with N Pacific sources and wetter conditions including during the Little Ice Age.

J	Emami, F; Koch, M				Emami, Farzad; Koch, Manfred			Evaluation of Statistical-Downscaling/Bias-Correction Methods to Predict Hydrologic Responses to Climate Change in the Zarrine River Basin, Iran	CLIMATE												Modeling the hydrologic responses to future changes of climate is important for improving adaptive water management. In the present application to the Zarrine River Basin (ZRB), with the major reach being the main inflow source of Lake Urmia (LU), firstly future daily temperatures and precipitation are predicted using two statistical downscaling methods: the classical statistical downscaling model (SDSM), augmented by a trend-preserving bias correction, and a two-step updated quantile mapping (QM) method. The general circulation models (GCM) input to SDSM are climate predictors of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) GCM under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios, RCP45 and RCP85, whereas that to the QM is provided by the most suitable of several Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs under RCP60, in addition. The performances of the two downscaling methods are compared to each other for a past "future" period (2006-2016) and the QM is found to be better and so is selected in the subsequent ZR streamflow simulations by means of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, calibrated and validated for the reference period (1991-2012). The impacts of climate change on the hydrologic response of the river basin, specifically the inflow to the Boukan Reservoir, the reservoir-dependable water release (DWR), are then compared for the three RCPs in the near- (2020-2038), middle- (2050-2068) and far- (2080-2098) future periods assuming (1) the "current" consumptive demand to be continued in the future, and (2) a more conservative "recommended" demand. A systematic future shortage of the available water is obtained for case (1) which can be mitigated somewhat for (2). Finally, the SWAT-predicted ZRB outflow is compared with the Montana-based estimated environmental flow of the ZR. The latter can successfully be sustained at good and fair levels for the near- and middle-future periods, but not so for the summer months of the far-future period, particularly, for RCP85.																				2225-1154				JUN	2018	6	2							30	10.3390/cli6020030	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6020030													WOS:000436491700012
J	Russell, JM; Johnson, TC				Russell, JM; Johnson, TC			A high-resolution geochemical record from Lake Edward, Uganda Congo and the timing and causes of tropical African drought during the late Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution analyses of the elemental composition of calcite and biogenic silica (BSi) content in piston cores from Lake Edward, equatorial Africa, document complex interactions between climate variability and lacustrine geochemistry over the past 5400 years. Correlation of these records from Lake Edward to other climatically-forced geochemical and lake level records from Lakes Naivasha, Tanganyika, and Turkana allows us to develop a chronology of drought events in equatorial East Africa during the late Holocene. Major drought events of at least century-scale duration are recorded in lacustrine records at about 850, 1500, similar to 2000, and 4100 cal year BP. Of these, the most severe event occurred between about 2050 and 1850 cal year BP, during which time Lake Edward stood about 15 in below its present level. Numerous additional droughts of less intensity and/or duration are present in the Lake Edward record, some of which may be correlated to other lacustrine climate records from equatorial East Africa. These events are superimposed on a long-term trend of increasingly and conditions from 5400 to about 2000 cal year BP, followed by a shift toward wetter climates that may have resulted from an intensification of the winter Indian monsoon. Although the causes of decade- to century-scale climate variability in the East African tropics remain obscure, time-series spectral analysis suggests no direct linkage between solar output and regional rainfall. Rather, significant periods of similar to 725, similar to 125, 63-72, 31-25, and 19-16 years suggest a tight linkage between the Indian Ocean and African rainfall, and could result from coupled ocean-atmosphere variability inherent to the tropical monsoon system.

Browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americana Erxl.) inhibited establishment and recruitment of white pine in an old-growth pine-dominated forest located in a major winter deer yard in northeastern Minnesota. In a nine-year study, we investigated the effectiveness of exclosures to control browsing and improve establishment and early recruitment of eastern white pine. Properly constructed and maintained exclosures virtually eliminated browsing. As a result, density in the largest size class (sterns >50 cm tall but <2.5 cm dbh) increased significantly between 1991 and 1997 in two exclosures plots (P < 0.1; two-tailed paired t-test). Reference plots showed no evidence of pine recruitment into the largest size class. We report a little documented factor with potential for aiding eastern white pine establishment: dense patches of young white spruce (Picea glauca L.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Miller), which may buffer white pine seedlings and saplings from browsing. Browsing is just one factor affecting Survival and growth of eastern white pine. We propose a model incorporating multiple factors to consider when deciding on effective strategies for the restoration of eastern white pine in the northern Lake States region.

Monitoring British Upland Ecosystems With the Use of Landscape Structure as an Indicator for State-and-Transition Models	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Remote sensing and landscape ecology concepts can provide a useful framework for state-and-transition models (STM) in order to quantify thresholds at different scales, and provide useful information for scientists, land managers, and conservationists in relation to resilience management. The overall aim of this research was to develop a spatially explicit STM to quantify thresholds based on the scale of disturbance processes impacting a grazing system. Specific objectives were to develop a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing ecosystems, to quantify spatial dynamics of stable and degraded pastures, and to assess threshold occurrence. Color aerial photography from Armboth Fell in the English Lake District National Park (United Kingdom) was classified into bare rock, dwarf shrub heath (DSH), and grassland/degraded wet heath (GDWH) in four pastures with different degrees of grazing pressure. Vegetation communities from these pastures were combined with soils, climate, and landform data to create a conceptual STM framework. Each pasture was sampled with 2-ha plots to quantify DSH and GDWH spatial structure. The proposed STM consisted of two reference and three alternative states. Low-grazing-pressure areas showed significantly higher percentage of DSH cover with larger contiguous patches and lower patch density than high-grazing-pressure areas. Breakpoints, considered to be thresholds, in mean patch area were identified in our data when DSH percentage cover was < 63% and GDWH, > 77%. The present study has shown the value of a robust, reliable, and repeatable approach to identify landscape dynamics and integrate it with field data to inform a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing ecosystems. It also demonstrates the importance of selecting scales relevant to the predominant disturbance process to test for threshold occurrence, and how this approach can be integrated with current assessment methods for resilience management.

Neotectonic and climatic impressions in the zone of Trans Himadri Fault (THF), Kumaun Tethys Himalaya, India: A case study from palaeolake deposits	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Late Quaternary tectonic activity on a NW-SE trending fault within the Trans Himadri Fault (THF) zone in lower reaches of the Milam glacier (Indian Tethys Himalaya) resulted in development of a lake around 23 ka BP. The remnants of the ancient lake are preserved in form of a 25.6 m thick lacustrine profile, consisting of muds and sands. The palaeolake seems to have breached around 11 ka BP possibly due to revival of a further event of neotectonic activity. The geomorphic consequences of the tectonic movements in the fault zone are manifest in form of palaeo-landslide cones, unpaired terraces, fault facets, soaring waterfalls, deep gorges and slope failures etc. The soft sedimentary structures, e. g., micro-faulting and flame structures in the exposed profile also point to a possible reactivation of the THF in the Late Pleistocene. We present the first palynological results from otherwise a totally unexplored area in the eastern part of the Indian Tethys Himalaya. The preliminary results indicate that the area experienced cold desertic climatic conditions from ca. 22.9 to 15.7 ka BP covering a period of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during which the sediment accumulation rate was also extremely slow. This phase was followed by deglaciation together with amelioration of climate between ca. 15.7 and 14.5 ka BP. A dry period from ca. 14.5 to 13.8 ka BP can be associated with the Older Dryas. The area underwent wetter/moist conditions from ca. 13.8 to 12.8 ka BP, followed by a century scale dry event (ca. 12.8 to 12.7 ka BP) which may be linked to the Younger Dryas episode.																			0372-8854					SEP	2013	57	3					289	303		10.1127/0372-8854/2013/0101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0372-8854/2013/0101													WOS:000324567500002

Its primary goals are to understand the controls on metal concentrations in the lakes. The program used mesocosms to test a variety of remediation strategies and verify and improve an existing coupled physical-geochemical model to improve predictions of pit lake water quality. Initial data from two summer surveys in the Main Zone pit lake reveal elevated dissolved metal concentrations (Zn as high as 800 mug/L) in a 2-m- (6.6-ft-) deep mixed layer and reveal elevated particulate metal concentrations towards the bottom of the water column. Hydroxide sludge, a byproduct of acid rock drainage (ARD) treatment, is being discharged to the surface waters of the Main Zone pit lake. The sludge sinks rapidly to the lake bottom, which leads to deep waters with elevated levels of dissolved O-2 and total metals. By contrast, the deep waters of the proximal Waterline pit take are mildly reducing, manifested by depletion of O-2 and elevated levels of dissolved Fe. These reducing conditions have led to elevated levels of As (up to 1,500 mug/L) in Waterline pit deep waters. The contrasting behavior of these two pit lakes, as well as the processes controlling metal concentrations in the lakes, is discussed.

The potential impact of sediment-associated contamination of Saginaw Bay and Saginaw River was evaluated by employing two solid phase bioassays with the amphipod Diporeia spp. (formerly named Pontoporeia hoyi). Two effects examined in the bioassays were mortality after 28 d and avoidance/preference for the sediments after 5 d. Saginaw Bay Station S-61, located off the coast of Tawas Bay, was the only location where bay sediment elicited significant mortality. Although sediment preference tended to increase from the inner bay to the outer bay with S-61 the most preferred, there were no statistical differences among stations. River sediments from all stations collected in December 1989 produced significant mortality, with sediments from Station SR-106, just below the Bay City Waste Water Treatment Plant out-fall, producing the greatest response. Sediments from SR-106 were also the most avoided of the river sediments from this first collection. A subsequent collection of sediments in June 1990 from the Saginaw River produced no mortality and no significant avoidance of the sediments. The results from these two bioassay methods suggest the presence of potential contaminant problems in both the bay and river, and indicate that both lethal and sublethal effects may occur.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					322	332		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71220-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71220-4													WOS:A1993LN30700012

Via shore surveys and community contacts among fishers from five Ontario AOCs, we recruited 91 frequent consumers of Great Lakes (GL) fish. Through personal interviews using a questionnaire and fish portion models, we solicited information on fish and aquatic wildlife consumption and preparation practices. For descriptive purposes, we grouped participants into European/Canadian/US-born (EC) (n = 47) and Asian-born (AC) (n = 44). The three species most frequently eaten by the AC group were rock bass, largemouth bass, and white bass, in contrast to yellow perch, walleye, and small-mouth bass among EC. During meal preparation, both groups removed the fat and tended to fry the fish. EC tended to eat the fillets and steaks, with AC eating a wider variety of fish parts. Portion sizes varied by species, country of origin, and gender, ranging from the smallest median of 104 gin for catfish to the largest median value of 692 gm for walleye. Average number of GL fish meals consumed varied greatly (range = 26-501 meals) with AC participants reporting greater numbers of meals than EC participants, particularly in the summer (p =.013). The estimated median grams of GL fish consumed per day ranged from 46 gm among AC men to 199 gm among EC men. The diversity of fishing and consumption patterns has implications for both fish monitoring programs and health risk assessments.

But under certain circumstances nitrate may enhance water quality through a number of mechanisms, including enhancing oxidant capacity, regulation of redox potential, and suppression of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. In this review the authors explore a range of case studies in which nitrate addition enhanced surface water quality including: purposeful addition of nitrate salts to lakes to repress internal phosphorus (P) loading, enhance organic matter oxidation, or impede bottom-water accumulation of methylmercury; purposeful and incidental addition of nitrate from point and nonpoint discharges to reservoirs and lakes; nitrogen (N) addition to lakes to affect phytoplankton and zooplankton composition; and nitrate addition to estuary sediment to repress hydrogen sulfide production. Nitrate addition decreased internal P and methylmercury loading, repressed sulfide production, and enhanced surface water quality by lowering total P, chlorophyll content, and phytoplankton dominance by cyanobacteria. No case study reported a worsening of eutrophic conditions due to nitrate addition, and a number of studies reported near complete loss of nitrate from the systems to which it was added. When purposely adding nitrate to anoxic surface waters, protocols should be used to maximize nitrate loss via biological denitrification but minimize enhancement of phytoplankton productivity. These protocols should include adding nitrate close to the sediment-water interface to promote nitrate loss via denitrification, managing the timing and magnitude of nitrate addition so that nitrate is depleted prior lake overturn in the fall, and not adding nitrate to N-limited systems. Elimination of existing N discharges to receiving waters should be implemented on a case-by-case basis with the awareness that nitrate in discharges may enhance surface water quality, particularly by suppressing internal P loading and associated phytoplankton productivity. In addition, managers and regulators should look to couple existing nitrate discharges with hypoxic water bodies in an effort to sustainably enhance water quality while removing nitrate from aquatic ecosystems via biological denitrification.					; Gebremariam, Seyoum/AAC-6197-2022	Cubas, Francisco/0000-0001-6450-2390; 													1064-3389	1547-6537					2016	46	7					673	700		10.1080/10643389.2016.1151243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2016.1151243													WOS:000374956500002

On clear summer days, transparent bottles filled with surface water were set up at several depths and were collected every three hours together with the measurement of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In the laboratory experiment, two cyanobacterial species were exposed to gradually increasing and then decreasing light intensities. The samples were analyzed with the PAR-induced (H2O2), along with the total hydrogen peroxide concentrations (total H2O2), the catalase activities (CAT), OD730, protein (Protein), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) contents, and so on. Protein was significantly proportionate with OD730 and Chl a, and was used as an indicator of cell biomass. Increasing PAR, H2O2 concentration increased proportionately with the PAR intensity. Then, an oxidative stress indicator in a cell, H2O2/Protein is given by the PAR divided by cell volume, evaluated by Protein. CAT activity in a cell, far largest among antioxidant activities, solely followed total H2O2/Protein. The prediction model for H2O2/Protein was developed with the sufficient agreement with the experimental and field observation results. The model elucidated that the maximum H2O2/Protein in a day was larger with lower cell density even at the water surface, indicating that the higher photoinhibition was imposed at low density, in addition to the lower attenuation of PAR. These results indicate that H2O2/Protein is an effective biomarker to indicate the stress level of cyanobacteria; the observed levels of H2O2 to freshwater may prove useful in designing the criteria for cyanobacteria management.

El-Fayoum Oasis and Governorate in Egypt, has a unique heterogenic environment that encompasses desert, lakes, agriculture lands, and urban areas. It is quite rich in historical heritage reflected by abundant archaeological and cultural sites, many of which fall in desert zones. A main constraint is the poor or lack of accessibility to such sites. In this study, we designed a geospatial model for planning a sustainable least cost tourist route (path) to link and develop three archaeological sites namely; Madinet Madi, Watfa city and Ummal-Barijat ruins. Spatial multicriteria decision analysis was integrated with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the least cost path modules. Three cost criteria themes were created associated with economic, social and environmental costs. A cost surface and a least-cost path were created for each criterion and for each theme. The themes were combined using weighted linear combination to create four least cost scenarios for the path. Five preference criteria were used to compare the four route scenarios. Results show that the environmental scenario scored first scoring 0.69 while the economy path scores second 0.42, the equal weights path scores third 0.40 and finally the social path comes to be the last having a preference score 0.36. The method is flexible because priority can be changed and adapted according to specifications and site variances. It can be helpful for decision makers and planners in planning routes based on visual maps and priority visions.

Reconstructing the interactions between climate, fire, and vegetation dynamics during the Holocene, North Slave Region, Northwest Territories, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Local-scale fire regimes are controlled by climate, fuel availability, and topography. Research on long-term (i.e., Holocene timescales) fire activity in the Northwest Territories has focused on local fire dynamics, with fewer studies examining regional patterns. To investigate the impacts of climate variability on wildfire activity during the Holocene, 13 macroscopic charcoal and 3 pollen records, as well as insolation values, reconstructed temperatures, and precipitation data were analyzed to understand the interactions of climate, regional fire regimes and vegetation during the Holocene in the North Slave Region, Northwest Territories, Canada. Following deglaciation, wildfire activity across the region was low, due to lack of fuels, relatively low temperatures, and dry conditions. By similar to 8200 cal yrs. BP, wildfire activity increased across the region as Picea expanded on the landscape increasing fuel availability and summer temperatures increased and peaked during the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Wildfire activity continued to increase throughout the mid-Holocene until cooler and wetter conditions developed with the onset of Neoglacial cooling around 4200 cal yrs. BP. With the onset of cooler and wetter conditions, wildfires declined regionally across the North Slave Region. The decline in wildfire activity following Neoglacial cooling can be attributed to a general decline in temperatures and changes in vegetations types and density. During the 20th century, wildfire activity increased in response to warming temperatures. With further increases in global mean temperature, it is expected that wildfire activity in the North Slave Region will increase during the 21st century.

However, the mechanisms that influence CH4 dynamics during ice-covered periods remain poorly studied. To investigate the effects of bubbles on CH4 dynamics, we conducted intensive field and incubation experiments in an ice-covered reservoir (ice growth, stability, and melt period) in Northeast China. We found that the mean dissolved CH4 concentrations in the ice (625.9 +/- 2419.7 nmol L-1) and underlying water (1218.9 +/- 2678.9 nmol L-1) were high, making them atmosphere CH4 sources. The visible bubble bands (bubble area) in the riverine zone and the vertical profile of the CH4 concentration in the ice reflect the distribution of trapped bubbles. The mean CH4 concentration in the ice of the bubble area (1674.8 +/- 3926.8 nmol L-1) was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of no-bubble area (53.7 +/- 9.2 nmol L-1). Moreover, a large amount of CH4 accumulated under the ice in the bubble area. These findings suggest that bubbles determine the CH4 storage in ice and CH4 accumulation in the underlying water. Ice growth increases CH4 storage in ice and the underlying water because of the entrapment and re-dissolution of CH4 bubbles. However, ice melting releases the CH4 accumulated in the ice and underlying water. A comparison of the field and incubation experiments indicated that the deep-water environment of the reservoir had a CH4 burial effect.

Anaerobic microorganisms in astrobiological analogue environments: from field site to culture collection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY												Astrobiology seeks to understand the limits of life and to determine the physiology of organisms in order to better assess the habitability of other worlds. To successfully achieve these goals we require microorganisms from environments on Earth that approximate to extraterrestrial environments in terms of physical and/or chemical conditions. The most challenging of these environments with respect to sample collection, isolation and cultivation of microorganisms are anoxic environments. In this paper, an approach to this challenge was implemented within the European Union's MASE (Mars Analogues for Space Exploration) project. In this review paper, we aim to provide a set of methods for future field work and sampling campaigns. A number of anoxic environment based on characteristics that make them analogous to past and present locations on Mars were selected. They included anoxic sulphur-rich springs (Germany), the salt-rich Boulby Mine (UK), a lake in a basaltic context (Iceland), acidic sediments in the Rio Tinto (Spain), glacier samples (Austria) and permafrost samples (Russia and Canada). Samples were collected under strict anoxic conditions to be used for cultivation and genomic community analysis. Using the samples, a culturing approach was implemented to enrich anaerobic organisms using a defined medium that would allow for organisms to be grown under identical conditions in future physiological comparisons. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated and deposited with the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH) culture collection to make them available to other scientists. In MASE, the selected organisms are studied with respect to survival and growth under Mars relevant stresses. They are artificially fossilized and the resulting biosignatures studied and used to investigate the efficacy of life detection instrumentation for planetary missions. Some of the organisms belong to genera with medical and environmental importance such as Yersinia spp., illustrating how astrobiology field research can be used to increase the availability of microbial isolates for applied terrestrial purposes.					; Vannier, Pauline/GZZ-4844-2022; Rettberg, Petra/K-2378-2015; Garcia-Descalzo, Laura/S-2777-2018; Moissl-Eichinger, Christine/A-6682-2015; García-Descalzo, Laura/S-2777-2018; Gomez, Felipe/L-7315-2014; Gómez, Felipe/L-7315-2014; Amils, Ricardo/X-2706-2019	Cabezas, Patricia/0000-0002-6336-4093; Rettberg, Petra/0000-0003-4439-2395; Marteinsson, Viggo/0000-0001-8340-821X; Garcia-Descalzo, Laura/0000-0002-0083-6786; Moissl-Eichinger, Christine/0000-0001-6755-6263; Gomez, Felipe/0000-0001-9977-7060; Vannier, Pauline/0000-0002-7747-8534; 													1473-5504	1475-3006				OCT	2018	17	4					314	328		10.1017/S1473550417000246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1473550417000246													WOS:000443950500006

Radiocarbon-dated results of pollen, macrofossils, wood, and charcoal along with radiocarbon dating analysis were used to reconstruct the environmental history of the site. The wetland, originally probably a small lake, started to accumulate sediments at about 8800 cal. yr BC at Frutigen Tellenfeld. A pine forest (Pinus silvestris) admixed with hazel (Corylus avellana), other thermophilous arboreal taxa (Ulmus, Tilia, Quercus) and birch (Betula) grew in the surroundings of the lake. This very early importance of hazel is documented by C-14-dated Corylus nut fragments (9310+/-50 C-14 yr BP, 8722-8337 yr BC). After 8500 BC hazel expanded on the costs of pine. The palaeo records suggest that the forests were severely disturbed by a catastrophic event at around 7600 BC. In response, forest fires strongly increased and ferns and grasses expanded and then pine stands established. At ca. 7100 BC the lake was abruptly destroyed by rockfall masses transported by a debris flow. The geomorphic situation suggests that these events were closely related with the main Kander valley rockfall, which had an exceptional size (800 millions m(3)). Local environmental catastrophes as a consequence of the rockfall at 7600-7100 BC occurred during an early Holocene thermal and solar irradiation maximum. As documented by previous investigations, this period was characterised by pronounced slope instabilities in the Alps and elsewhere.					; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013	Boschetti, Adriano/0000-0003-1754-3223; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144													0012-9402						2005	98	1					83	95		10.1007/s00015-005-1147-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00015-005-1147-8													WOS:000231724000005

Yet, despite extreme aridity, this desert region hosts the endemic cichlid genus Danakilia. As currently recognized, the genus includes at least two populations of Danakilia franchettii from groundwater springs feeding Lake Afrera (Ethiopia), one population of Danakilia dinicolai from volcanic Lake Abaeded, and three recently discovered riverine populations (Eritrea) of uncertain taxonomic status. Here, we analyse the variation in shape of the body and lower pharyngeal jaw of all known populations, using a geometric morphometrics approach. We investigate whether body and lower pharyngeal jaw shape, two evolutionarily important traits in cichlids, vary within and between Danakilia populations; whether patterns of variation in these traits are consistent with local adaptation (genetic or plastic) or a neutral model of variation in geographical space; and whether these traits show consistent patterns of covariation that might result from pleiotropy or linkage. We found that shape variation between the Afrera and the Abaeded samples confirms current taxonomy. We observed a sharp separation of the southern Afrera populations from all northern populations for both traits, with a less pronounced separation among the northern populations, and a deeper body in some populations compared with the more elongated shape of other riverine populations. Significant variation between all populations is not easily explained by phenotypic plasticity, suggesting that populations might be on independent, possibly neutral or quasi-neutral, evolutionary trajectories and constitute separate, highly vulnerable units deserving of conservation efforts.

J	OJALA, A				OJALA, A			IN-SITU DIEL DNA-SYNTHESIS OF A CRYPTOMONAS-SP IN A HYPEREUTROPHIC TARN	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The diel pattern of the cell cycle of a population of Cryptomonas sp. in a hypereutrophic tarn in northwest England was studied using an epifluorescence microscope connected to a photometer. Also investigated were the growth and vertical distribution of the population and the main characteristics of the tarn. Throughout the period of study, in late spring, the population of Cryptomonas sp. was declining due to loss processes and impaired growth potential. However, the population had maintained the ability to migrate and showed a pattern of evening descent and morning ascent. In the depth profile, cells appeared capable of surviving in the anoxic hypolimnion. Microfluorometry and DAPI staining proved suitable for measurements of relative DNA contents of Cryptomonas cells in situ, but because of the peculiarities of this particular cell cycle, results could not be used for calculations of species-specific growth rate. Cells in all phases were found throughout the 24-hour sampling cycle, and most of the time the majority of cells were in S phase. The number of cells in the G2 + M phase was maximum at 19.30 GMT and 03.00 GMT, indicating that mitosis of this Cryptomonas sp. took place just before sunset and sunrise.																			0003-3847						1993	30	2					119	129																WOS:A1993LV30300003

Additionally, the organic matter concentration and the P-fractions in the sediment were analysed. Despite their proximity, these two lagoons showed many significant differences ( P< 0.05). The P-concentration in the interstitial water of the top sediment was higher in the Laguna Honda (up to 1 mg l(-1)), especially during summer, when both sites registered their highest values. By contrast, the concentration of organic matter and organic P-fractions were higher in the sediment of the Laguna Nueva. The concentration of the organic matter in the vertical profile of the sediment decreased with depth in the Laguna Nueva ( from 17% at 0 cm to 7% at 15 cm, annual mean value) while it increased in the sediment of Laguna Honda ( from 9% at 0 cm to 12% at 15 cm, annual mean value). The P-concentration in the interstitial water and the organic matter in the top sediment of Laguna Honda followed a seasonal pattern and, were both correlated with the temperature of the bottom water (r = 0.706, P < 0.05 and r = - 0.929, P< 0.01, respectively). The inorg-P fractions comprised 63% of the Tot-phosphate in the sediment of Laguna Honda, whereas org-P fractions (68%) dominated in the sediment of Laguna Nueva. The concentrations of Tot-P in the sestonic material collected at three different depths of the water column averaged 2.2 mg g(-1)d. w. in Laguna Honda and 2.5 mg g(-1)d. w. in Laguna Nueva. The average atomic C: P ratio of the sestonic material was significantly higher in Laguna Honda than in Laguna Nueva, but the top sediment in Laguna Nueva had a C: P ratio significantly higher than that of the sestonic material ( average: 416 and 162, respectively). The different biodegradability of the organic matter in the top sediment probably explained the differences found in sediment composition between these two lagoons. We suggest that the P-reclying from the sediment to the interstitial water was faster in Laguna Honda due to the higher biodegradability of the organic matter. By contrast, the lower biodegradability of the organic matter in the top sediment of Laguna Nueva was probably due to a higher contribution of vascular plants which could explain the organic matter accumulation detected in this lagoon.

J	ISTVANOVICS, V; HERODEK, S				ISTVANOVICS, V; HERODEK, S			ESTIMATION OF NET UPTAKE AND LEAKAGE RATES OF ORTHOPHOSPHATE FROM P-32 UPTAKE KINETICS BY A LINEAR FORCE-FLOW MODEL	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												P-32-uptake kinetics of extremely P-deficient planktonic microorganisms were analyzed in shallow Lake Balaton by means of a conceptual model of P uptake. According to the model, net P uptake is a linear function of the driving force of the uptake and ceases below a substrate threshold for energetic reasons. We estimated net P-uptake and P-leakage rates from P-32-uptake data. The study period (January-May 1992) covered development, steady state growth, and collapse of a typical spring diatom bloom. P-32 incorporation of <3-, 3-12-, and > 12-mu m microorganisms was separated by postfiltration. On five occasions, net P-uptake rates were simultaneously obtained from chemical measurements. Chemically measured net P-uptake curves, P-32-uptake curves, and size partitioning of P-32 incorporation can be recalculated from the constants of the linear force-flow model. The initial orthophosphate concentration fluctuated around 0.1 mu g P liter(-1). The community-average P threshold exceeded the initial P concentration by a mean factor of 1.4, that of the > 12-mu m microorganisms by a mean factor of 3.9. Small-scale fluctuations of in situ P concentrations were necessary to maintain P uptake and growth of larger microorganisms. In a nonhomogeneous environment, sensitivity to the fluctuating nutrient concentrations, efficiency of leakage reduction, and lower maintenance cell quotas may provide a competitive advantage to more complex organisms.

Bluegills were trap-netted in May and June 1998 and 1999, and a creel survey was conducted during winter 1998-2001 on one or two lakes where bluegills had been tagged to determine angler exploitation. Thirty-three percent of anglers on one creeled lake were trophy anglers (i.e., fishing for large [greater than or equal to250 mm] bluegills), whereas 67% were there to harvest fish to eat. Exploitation was always less than 10% and the total annual mortality averaged 40% across all 18 lakes. The time to reach 200 mm ranged from 4.3 to 8.3 years. The relative stock density of preferred-length fish increased an average of 2.2 units in all 18 lakes with a 10% exploitation rate. However, yield declined 39% and the number harvested declined 62%. Bluegills would need to reach 200 mm in 4.2 years to ensure no reduction in yield at 10% exploitation. Both yield and size structure were higher with a 200-mm minimum length limit (relative to having no length limit) only in populations with the lowest natural mortality and at exploitation of 30% or more. Although 100% (N = 39) of anglers surveyed said they would favor a 200-mm minimum length limit to improve bluegill size structure, anglers would have to sacrifice harvest to achieve this goal. While a 200-mm minimum length limit did minimally increase size structure at current levels of exploitation across all 18 bluegill populations, the populations with the lowest natural mortality and fastest growth provided the highest increase in size structure with the lowest reduction in yield and number harvested.

J	DAVIS, DW; FRAZIER, WA				DAVIS, DW; FRAZIER, WA			INHERITANCE OF SOME GROWTH HABIT COMPONENTS IN CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSH LINES OF PHASEOLUS VULGARIS L	PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE												Analysis of the gene action involved in the expression of growth habit and some morphological characters related to habit was undertaken for certain bush bean populations. Two true bush varieties (White Seeded Tendercrop and Puregold Wax) and 2 Blue Lake bush lines (OSU 836-9 andOSU 2466), derived by recurrent backcrossing to the FM-1 Blue Lake pole bean, constituted a parental population within which all 12 possible crosses were made. F1 and F2 populations were grown. True bush varieties appeared to contain more of the recessive alleles for habit, plant height, number of central stem internodes, and number of branches than did the Blue Lake bush lines. Overall, the role of recessive genes in conditioning stiff, upright bush habit was considered of major importance. The net effect of genes conditioning the expression of habit was considered of major importance. The net effect of genes conditioning the expression of habit, height of pod attachment, and number of internodes was largely additive. In the expression of plant height, the net effect was largely non-additive; marked heterosis was noted. A tendency for heterosis in number of branches under field conditions was reversed under winter conditions in the greenhouse. In the greenhouse reciprocal differences were noted for plant height in F1 progeny of crosses between OSU 2466 and White Seeded Tendercrop.																			0099-4065						1966	88	JUN					384	+																WOS:A19668125400055

Identification of a Kulshan caldera correlative tephra in the Palouse loess of Washington State, northwest USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Kulshan caldera formed at -1.15 Ma on the present-day site of Mt. Baker, Washington State, northwest USA and erupted a compositionally zoned (dacite-rhyolite) magma and a correlative eruptive, the Lake Tapps tephra. This tephra has previously been described, but only from the Puget Lowland of NW Washington. Here an occurrence of a Kulshan caldera correlative tephra is described from the Quaternary Palouse loess at the Washtucna site (WA-3). Site WA-3 is located in east-central Washington, similar to 340 km southeast of the Kulshan caldera and similar to 300 km east-southeast of the Lake Tapps occurrence in the Puget Lowland. Major- and trace element chemistry and location of the deposit at Washtucna within reversed polarity sediments indicates that it is not correlative with the Mesa Falls, Rockland, Bishop Ash, Lava Creek B or Huckleberry Ridge tephras. Instead the Washtucna deposit is related to the Lake Tapps tephra by fractional crystallisation, but is chemically distinct, a consequence of its eruption from a compositionally zoned magma chamber. The correlation of the Washtucna occurrence to the Kulshan caldera-forming eruption indicates that it had an eruptive volume exceeding 100 km(3), and that its tephra could provide a valuable early-Pleistocene chronostratigraphic marker in the Pacific Northwest.

J	Telford, RJ; Lamb, HF				Telford, RJ; Lamb, HF			Groundwater-mediated response to Holocene climatic change recorded by the diatom stratigraphy of an Ethiopian crater lake	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The diatom stratigraphy of a 23-m sediment core from Lake Tilo, a maar lake in the Ethiopian Rift Valley, provides a 10,000-yr record of lake salinity and trophic status. Until 5500 C-14 yr B.P., the phytoplankton was dominated by Aulacoseira granulata, with only minor changes in the abundance of other diatoms; the lake was over 50 m deep, eutrophic, and oligosaline. At 5500 yr B.P., geothermal groundwater inflow, inferred from calcite and silica deposition rates, declined abruptly, and the lake became more oligotrophic, as indicated by a rapid rise in Cyclotella stelligera. About 4500 yr B.P., lake salinity began to increase, reaching approximately its present state ca. 2500 yr B.P., but with a temporary reversal to lower salinity at 4000-3500 yr B.P. The record shows no evidence of salinity increases equivalent to early Holocene low stands of the larger river-fed Rift Valley lakes, probably because of high rates of geothermal groundwater influx. It responded to reduced rainfall at 4500 yr B.P., when levels of the larger lakes also fell, because geothermal groundwater flux had diminished 1000 years earlier, independently of climate. Because geothermal groundwaters can form a significant proportion of a crater lake's hydrological budget and dominate its salinity budget, these results show that variable geothermal groundwater flux can override lake hydrochemical response to climate change. Palaeoclimatic interpretation of palaeosalinity proxies from the sediments of volcanic crater lakes should be approached with caution.

J	Theodorakis, CW; Shugart, LR				Theodorakis, CW; Shugart, LR			Genetic ecotoxicology .2. population genetic structure in mosquitofish exposed in situ to radionuclides	ECOTOXICOLOGY												In 1977, approximately 250 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) from a relatively uncontaminated site (Crystal Springs) were transplanted into a small pond on the Department of Energy Oak Ridge Reservation which is heavily contaminated with radionuclides (Pond 3513). Starting in 1992, DNA polymorphism was evaluated using the RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA) and allozyme genotype techniques to determine if genetic differentiation had occurred between the two populations. Fish from a second radionuclide-contaminated population (White Oak Lake) and another unrelated non-contaminated population (Wolf Creek) were also examined. For the RAPD analyes, 15 RAPD primers (from a total of 40) were found to produce polymorphic banding patterns in at least two of the four populations and subsequently were used to produce a total of 142 bands. Data generated by these RAPD primers indicated an increased genetic diversity in radionuclide-contaminated sites relative to reference sites. Furthermore, the patterns from six RAPD primers produced a higher average number of bands when using DNA from radionuclide-contaminated populations than from non-contaminated, and for three RAPD primers the average number of bands from radionuclide-contaminated populations was lower. In addition, 17 bands occurred at a higher frequency in the radionuclide-contaminated compared to the non-contaminated populations. For the allozyme analyses, it was found that there was a higher percentage of polymorphism and heterozygosity in the radionuclide-contaminated relative to non-contaminated sites. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary effects of contaminant exposure as well as to the development of population-level biomarkers.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				DEC	1997	6	6					335	354		10.1023/A:1018695231565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018695231565													WOS:A1997YJ20900003

We conducted the 1st radiotracking study of habitat preferences of the pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), a threatened habitat specialist, comparing movements of breeding females during pregnancy and lactation in a lakeland zone of Poland. Pond bats are known to forage almost exclusively over water bodies. We predicted that 1) females commute shorter distances during lactation than during pregnancy, as they need to return to the colony during night to feed their young, and 2) pond bats select eutrophic lakes due to greater abundance of aquatic insects. The 1st prediction was confirmed, as pregnant females covered significantly longer distances between roosts and foraging sites (median 11.4 km) than lactating females (median 2.9 km). During pregnancy, bats foraged mostly over lakes and only rarely over rivers, using both habitats as available, but carp fishponds were selected. Lactating females selected rivers and canals but avoided lakes. The 2nd prediction was confirmed only in spring. Pregnant females selected eutrophic and avoided mesotrophic lakes, whereas during lactation, mesotrophic lakes were selected and eutrophic ones were avoided. This could explain the switch from chironomids, of smaller body size and found in eutrophic waters, to larger caddisflies, found in fast-flowing rivers, observed the diet of pond bats in a previous study. Lactating females may maximize their energy gain by shifting to large insects, thus obtaining larger portions of energy by a single capture effort. This study exposes the importance of small, relatively fast-flowing rivers in an energetically crucial period of the year for a species that has been perceived as associated with larger water bodies.					; Kokurewicz, Tomasz/C-7729-2017	Lazarus, Magdalena/0000-0002-6104-6390; Kokurewicz, Tomasz/0000-0002-3906-2124; 													0022-2372	1545-1542				FEB	2017	98	1					232	245		10.1093/jmammal/gyw108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyw108													WOS:000397232500024

Rare earth element geochemistry of the Late Quaternary tephra and volcano-clastic sediments from the Pachuca subbasin, north-eastern Basin of Mexico	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL												Chondrite normalized REE patterns, fractionations of light (La/Sm), heavy (Gd/Yb) and total (La/Yb) REE and Eu anomalies of the Late Quaternary multi-layer tephra fall deposits and overlying volcano-clastic sediments deposited in the Pachuca sub-basin (north-eastern Basin of Mexico) are studied to characterize their geochemical signatures. The REE geochemistry is compared with mineralogical abundances and multi-element concentrations to identify the possible source terrains contributing sediments into the basin. The basalt to basaltic-andesite tephra deposits have chemical compositions comparable to the rocks from Apan-Tezontepec volcanic field and consist of plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine. They are characterized by lower total REE abundances, lower light and heavy REE fractionations and a positive Eu anomaly. The overlying sediments show significantly different REE characteristics and can be divided into two different groups (i.e. I and II). The geochemical composition and REE patterns of group I (15-17 m, 4.6-9.6 m and 2-4.6 m depths) are comparable to the tephra deposits and suggest a mafic provenance. They are characterized by the absence of the Eu anomaly and lower total REE concentrations compared to group II. In group II (9.6-15 m and 0-2 m depths), higher total REE, a negative Eu anomaly, abundant K-feldspar and enriched Zr, Y and Th indicate felsic source terrains containing heavy minerals such as allanite, monazite and zircon.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Hernandez-Alvarez, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4717-1790													0016-7169					MAR	2010	49	1					3	15																WOS:000273292600001
J	Goulding, HL; Prowse, TD; Beltaos, S				Goulding, Holly L.; Prowse, Terry D.; Beltaos, Spyros			Spatial and temporal patterns of break-up and ice-jam flooding in the Mackenzie Delta, NWT	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					34th Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union	MAY 11-14, 2008	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Natl Comm, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Canadian Geophys Union				The Mackenzie Delta is covered in freshwater lakes that provide habitat for a myriad of species. The hydrology and ecology of these delta lakes are dominated by cryospheric processes, specifically spring break-up ice jams, which typically produce the largest hydrologic event of the year. Despite the importance of ice-induced flooding in the delta, the patterns and processes characterizing these events are poorly understood. In this paper, archived records at a dozen hydrometric stations in the delta for the period from 1974 to 2006, improved with information from remotely sensed imagery, are used to assemble a break-up chronology for the delta, and examine the spatial and temporal patterns of break-up flooding. Analysis of backwater level and discharge at the Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River (MARR) station are used to explain the physical rationale of the resulting patterns. Results highlight years of extensive delta flooding, and within the subset of significant flood years, two event types are identified: (1) ice-driven events, with high backwater levels at MARR associated with high levels in the southern and eastern/western delta, and (2) discharge-driven events, with extensive high-water levels in the mid/outer delta and along Middle Channel, despite lower upstream peak water levels. Temporally, the break-up initiation during ice- (discharge-) driven events occurs earlier (later) than the delta average. These occur later (earlier) in the time-series that is trending toward earlier break-ups. The MARR station is determined to be a suitable index of delta peak water levels for continued investigation into the hydroclimatic controls on extreme hydrological events in the Mackenzie Delta.

Recent studies demonstrate that the distributions of bGDGTs are sensitive to various environmental factors. In an effort to understand how and to what extent soil moisture (expressed as soil water content (SWC) or mean annual precipitation (MAP), pH and temperature may impact the distribution of bGDGTs, and to shed more light on the biological sources of bGDGTs in cold and arid regions, we investigated the distribution of bGDGTs as well as bacterial 16S rRNA gene and functional genes involved in the N cycle (including amoA, nirS and nirK) in 41 surface soil samples from around Lake Qinghai and east of Qaidam Basin on the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We found that lower soil moisture reduced the fractional concentrations of cyclic bGDGTs and thus the cyclisation ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) index correlated negatively with SWC and MAP, suggesting that soil moisture is an important factor controlling bGDGT distributions in soils in this arid and semi-arid region. Two subgroups of bGDGTs were assigned on the basis of cluster analysis, and bGDGT indices behaved differently in the two groups, hinting at different biosynthetic mechanisms for bGDGTs under different environmental conditions. Real time PCR results showed that nirS and nirK genes correlated significantly with the concentration of bGDGTs, suggesting that the nirS- or nirK-encoding bacteria involved in denitrification might potentially be an additional biological source for soil bGDGTs (besides Acidobacteria). Moreover, our results also support the application of new indices based on 5-methyl bGDGTs and 6-methyl bGDGTs in reconstructing past temperature and pH variations in this region.					; Zhang, Chuanlun/U-8181-2017; Wang, Huanye/I-4001-2015; Li, Fuyan/GQQ-3358-2022; Sun, Chijun/GLS-7559-2022	Li, Fuyan/0000-0003-2421-3767; Sun, Chijun/0000-0002-3668-346X													1674-7313	1869-1897				SEP	2016	59	9					1834	1846		10.1007/s11430-015-0230-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-015-0230-2													WOS:000382669900012
J	Joyce, DG; Rehfeldt, GE				Joyce, Dennis G.; Rehfeldt, Gerald E.			Climatic niche, ecological genetics, and impact of climate change on eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.): Guidelines for land managers	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Approximately, 123,500 forest inventory and ecological ground plots representing eastern North America were used to predict the contemporary distribution of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) from climate. The random forests classification tree procedures produced an 8-variable algorithm that had an 8% overall error rate. Erroneous predictions of presence, or errors of commission, were 13%, while falsely predicting absence, or errors of omission were 1%. Climate-based multiple regression models were developed to describe patterns of genetic variation among 112 populations representing the range of P. strobus in Ontario, Canada east of Lake Superior. Degree days >5 degrees C was the best predictor of variation in phenology and growth potential, with 5-year height providing the greatest resolution of inter-population variation (R-2 = 0.68). Cold hardiness in the fall was most closely associated with mean minimum temperature (R-2 = 0.26). Height growth data from four disparate provenance test series that together included a total of 354 provenances corroborated the range-wide applicability of the regional genetic models. Although variation in growth potential in the central Appalachian Mountains was most closely associated with mean minimum temperature, degree days >5 degrees C remained the best predictor of range-wide variation in growth potential (R-2 = 0.41). The contemporary distribution and inter-population genetic variation were projected into future climates predicted by three General Circulation Models, two scenarios, and three time steps. All projections indicate early and sustained deterioration in the contemporary habitat. Concurrence among projections regarding the redistribution of suitable habitat to the north of the contemporary distribution identifies geographic locations with the highest probability of supporting vigorous stands of P. strobus.

We examined the toxicity of iodine to Atlantic salmon eggs and its effectiveness as a disinfectant against bacteria on egg surfaces. We spawned and fertilized eight gravid Atlantic salmon from Cayuga Lake, New York, and exposed their eggs to 10 concentrations of iodine (5, 10, 50, 75, 100, 500, 750, 1,000, 5,000, and 7,500 mg/L) for 30 min during water hardening. An additional subsample of unfertilized eggs was also exposed to some of the same concentrations of iodine (5, 10, 50, 75, and 100 mg/L) to determine the efficiency of disinfection. Viable eggs were only obtained from four females. Survival of eggs to the eyed stage and hatch tended to be reduced at iodine concentrations of 50 and 75 mg/L and was significantly reduced at concentrations of 100 mg/L iodine or more. We calculated the concentrations of iodine that killed 50% of the Atlantic salmon eggs at eye-up and hatch to be 175 and 85 mg/L, respectively. Aeromonas veronii, A. schubertii, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, Plesiomonas shiggeloides, and Citrobacter spp. were the predominant bacteria present on the surface of green eggs and were significantly reduced by an iodine immersion. The use of iodine as a disinfectant on Atlantic salmon eggs was effective at low concentrations (50-75 mg/L), for which toxicity to Atlantic salmon was minimal.																			1522-2055	1548-8454					2011	73	2					124	128	PII 934642508	10.1080/15222055.2011.559865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2011.559865													WOS:000288336200006

Climate change and human activities have greatly altered the habitats of waterbirds in this region.Methods: The potential distribution of suitable habitats for the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) in the MLYRB was projected using Maximum Entropy Models (MaxEnt) and three Global Climate Models (GCMs). Additionally, estimations for temperature and precipitation before 2060 were made using CMIP6 multi-model and multi-scenario data.Results: 1) the MaxEnt model was highly applicable (AUC = 0.939) for analyzing the suitable habitat distribution and climatic suitability of Siberian cranes in the study area; 2) Precipitation of the driest quarter and altitude were the main factors affecting the potential suitable habitat distribution of Siberian cranes, accounting for 40% of the total contribution rate each; 3) The climatically suitable areas for the distribution of suitable habitats of Siberian cranes in the study area was mainly concentrated in parts of Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, Taihu Lake, and the mainstream of the Yangtze River; 4) In the BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, and CNRM-CM6-1 models, the suitable habitat area for Siberian cranes is expected to decrease under different SSP scenarios from 2021 to 2060 compared to 1970-2000.Discussion: The BCC-CSM2-MR model's SSP2-4.5 scenario shows the most significant decline in the suitable habitat area for Siberian cranes, with a maximum decrease of approximately 35.7%, followed by a maximum decrease of about 26.2% and 16.4% under the CNRM-CM6-1 and CanESM5 models' SSP2-4.5 scenario, respectively. In general, the suitable habitat areas for Siberian cranes are projected to decline, indicating the need for comprehensive evaluation and uncertainty research using more models.

This can lead to shifts in structure and functions of phytoplankton communities adversely affecting the quality of drinking water sources, which in turn impairs public health. Relationships between structures of phytoplankton communities and concentrations of the toxicant, microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR), have not been well examined in large shallow lakes. The present study investigated phytoplankton communities at seven locations from January to December of 2015 in Tai Lake, and relationships between structures and diversities of phytoplankton communities and water quality parameters, including concentrations of MC-LR and metals, were analyzed. Results: A total of 124 taxa of phytoplankton were observed, and the predominant taxa were Microcystis sp. and Dolichospermum flos-aquae of Cyanophyta and Planctonema sp. of Chlorophyta. The greatest diversities of phytoplankton communities, as indicated by species richness, Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices, were observed in spring. Furthermore, productivity of phytoplankton was significantly and negatively correlated with diversities. These results demonstrated that Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices of phytoplankton communities were significantly related to trophic status and overall primary productivity in Tai Lake. In addition, temperature of surface water, pH, permanganate index, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, arsenic, total nitrogen/total phosphorous ratio, and MC-LR were the main factors associated with structures of phytoplankton communities in Tai Lake. Conclusion: The present study provided helpful information on phytoplankton community structure and diversity in Tai Lake from January to December of 2015. Our findings demonstrated that Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices could be used to assess and monitor for status and trends in water quality of Tai Lake. In addition, MC-LR was one of the main factors associated with structures of phytoplankton communities in Tai Lake. The findings may help to address important ecological questions about the impact of a changing environment on biodiversity of lake ecosystems and the control of algae bloom. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between MC-LR and phytoplankton communities in the laboratory.					liu, hongling/G-2993-2011; Tao, Cheng-an/H-4232-2014; Su, Guanyong/A-7747-2017; Giesy, John/MXJ-7032-2025; Su, Guanyong/LCD-3731-2024; Zhang, Junyi/HDN-7815-2022; Tang, Song/E-9843-2013	Tang, Song/0000-0003-3219-1422; Su, Guanyong/0000-0003-4356-5194; Wu, Naicheng/0000-0002-5652-3631; Giesy, John/0000-0003-1931-9962; 													2190-4707	2190-4715				JUL 28	2018	30								27	10.1186/s12302-018-0152-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-018-0152-2								30148024					WOS:000440157300001
J	Murfitt, J; Brown, LC				Murfitt, Justin; Brown, Laura C.			Lake ice and temperature trends for Ontario and Manitoba: 2001 to 2014	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lakes are a prominent geographic feature in northern landscapes and play an important role in understanding regional climate systems. In order to better model changes within climate systems, it is important to study lake ice processes. Although the availability of records for lake ice through ground measurements has declined in recent years, the increased use of remote sensing provides an alternative to this. Using a preclassified snow and ice remote sensing product with a 500-m resolution, based on images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/MOD10A1), and the use of measured and reanalysis temperature data, this study evaluated lake ice phenology dates in connection to recent trends in temperature and 0 degrees C isotherms within Ontario and Manitoba between 2001 and 2014. Temperature trends indicated both regional warming and cooling, with significant cooling observed in Southern Ontario (p<.05) and significant warming in Southern Manitoba (p<.1) during the fall. Spatial analysis of the trends in the lake ice data showed significant clustering of significant trends in ice on dates (p<.01). When analysing the trends in ice phenology in connection to the trends in temperature, it was found that 70% of lakes experienced a change in the ice on date with the expected change in temperature and 85% of lakes for ice off date. When shifting ice on and ice off dates are investigated in relation to 0 degrees C isotherms, it was seen that 80% of ice on dates and 100% of ice off dates shifted in sync with the isotherm dates. This demonstrates that the ice phenology of lakes in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, is responding to short-term variability in temperature. The MODIS product could be used to investigate ice phenology on a large scale and contribute towards expanding existing records of ice phenology. Establishing long-term ice records could be a valuable asset for other research ranging from water balance studies to the response of lake biota under changing climate.					; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Murfitt, Justin/0000-0002-7388-0964; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT	2017	31	21					3596	3609		10.1002/hyp.11295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11295													WOS:000412480000001

The ticks were collected in mid-spring (April and May) using the flagging technique. They were collected in five places: on the shoreline of Drawa River and Konotop Lake, as well as in forest and meadow areas near Karwice, Konotop and Oleszno Villages. During the work, only one species of ticks was caught Ixodes ricinus. All the collected specimens were assessed in terms of their species, sex and developmental stage by zoological specialists. The largest number of specimens was caught in Karwice (35%, n = 666). The highest number of ticks in each test site were nymphs (57%, n = 1106), except at Konotop. The reaction of RT-PCR was tested in 111 pools of ticks. As a result of the PCR reactions (VIASURE Tick- Borne Diseases Real-Time PCR Detection Kit), Rickettsia spp. (n = 70) and Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. n = 35) were determined to be the most frequently identified pathogens in the tick samples. Other pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia chaffeensis were detected in a smaller number of samples. The results in this paper confirm the epidemiological data collected and analysed prior to now.

J	Schaetzl, RJ; Schwenner, C				Schaetzl, RJ; Schwenner, C			An application of the runge "energy model" of soil development in Michigan's upper peninsula	SOIL SCIENCE												This paper examines some soils in Michigan's upper peninsula that do not "fit" with the zonal soils of the region. The typical upland soils in this part of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (PRNL), when not constrained by bedrock or high water tables, are strongly developed Spodosols (Haplorthods). We used the energy model (Runge, 1973) as a conceptual guide to help explain the genesis of nearby soils, whose chemistry and morphology are very different. The energy model presupposes that soils are affected mainly by water available for leaching and organic matter production, as conditioned by parent material. In our study area, where water available for leaching is limited (or even negative), as on steep slopes shallow to bedrock with multiple springs and seeps, and where erosional processes are strong, horizonation in the classical sense does not form. Instead, shallow Histosols (Saprists) form above bedrock, even on 45% slopes. Oxyaquic Haplorthods developed on flat uplands, on the same bedrock, are strongly horizonated, as most of the water that impacts them is available for leaching and pedogenesis. In another example, soils that have formed above calcareous bedrock maintain such high pH values that their faunal assemblages are rich and diverse, and base cycling is strong, leading to thick O + A horizon sequences. These soils (Lithic Udipsamments) resemble Mollisols and exhibit few marks of podzolization. Conversely, nearby Oxyaquic Haplorthods above acid sandstone bedrock have limited faunal assemblages, slow organic matter decomposition, and horizonation indicative of strong podzolization. These examples highlight how conceptual models can be used to guide our understanding of soil genesis and distribution.																			0038-075X	1538-9243				FEB	2006	171	2					152	166		10.1097/01.ss.0000187373.31026.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ss.0000187373.31026.04													WOS:000235912700007

Mercury distribution, partitioning and speciation in coastal vs. inland High Arctic snow	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Atmospheric mercury deposition on snow at springtime has been reported in polar regions, potentially posing a threat to coastal and inland ecosystems receiving meltwaters. However, the post-depositional fate of Hg in snow is not well known, and no data are available on Hg partitioning in polar snow. During snowrnelt, we conducted a survey of Hg concentrations, partitioning and speciation in surface snow and at depth, over sea ice and over land along a 100 km transect across Cornwallis Island, NU, Canada. Total Hg concentrations [THg] in surface snow were low (less than 20 pmol L-1) and were significantly higher in marine vs. inland environments. Particulate Hg in surface snow represented up to 90% of total Hg over sea ice and up to 59% over land. At depth, [THg] at the snow/sea ice interface (up to 300 pmol L-1) were two orders of magnitude higher than at the snow/lake ice interface (ca. 2.5 pmol L-1). Integrated snow columns, sampled over sea-ice and over land, showed that particulate Hg was mostly bound to particles ranging from 0.45 to 2.7 mu m. Moreover, melting snowpacks over sea ice and over lake ice contribute to increase [THg] at the water/ice interfaces. This study indicates that, at the onset of snowmelt, most of the Hg in snow is in particulate form, particularly over sea ice. Low Hg levels in surface snow suggest that Hg deposited through early spring deposition events is partly lost to the atmosphere from the snowpack before snowmelt. The sea ice/snow interface may constitute a site for Hg accumulation, however. Further understanding of the cycling of mercury at the sea ice/ snow and sea ice/seawater interfaces is thus warranted to fully understand how mercury enters the arctic food webs.

DO-Temperature habitat loss due to eutrophication in Tenkiller Reservoir, Oklahoma, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Welch EB, Cooke GD, Jones JR, Gendusa TC. 2011. DO-Temperature habitat loss due to eutrophication in Tenkiller Reservoir, Oklahoma, USA. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 271-285. Tenkiller Reservoir became eutrophic between 1975 and 1986, primarily due to poultry litter practices in the watershed, resulting in rapid dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion in the meta-and hypolimnion. Depletion was driven largely by high riverine-zone algal production due to high phosphorus inflow and internal loading, and the subsequent plunging of riverine water to the meta-and hypolimnion. This process of DO depletion greatly reduced summer habitat for cool-water fish species. Optimal and suboptimal habitat for smallmouth bass (SMB) growth averaged only 10 and 25% of total reservoir volume, respectively, during mid-June to mid-September in 2005 and 2006. For walleye (WAL), acceptable (suboptimal) habitat was essentially absent (<1%) due to its lower temperature criterion. By contrast, habitat for both species was much greater in oligo-mesotrophic Broken Bow, a physically similar reference reservoir. Long-term catch rates for SMB and WAL during systematic surveys averaged 3-fold higher in Broken Bow, with greater acceptable DO-temperature habitat than in Tenkiller. Conversely, catch rates for largemouth bass, a warm-water species preferring eutrophic conditions, averaged 2-fold higher in Tenkiller than Broken Bow. These catch rate differences are consistent with the DO-temperature conditions available during the stratified period and the trophic states in these 2 reservoirs. Recovery of cool-water fish habitat in Tenkiller by ceasing poultry litter application is predicted to be slow. [Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Upon initiation of macrophyte senescence, biomass on the two substrata became more similar. Experiments were conducted to investigate the basis for these observations. Whole extracts of intact vegetative Scirpus culms had no effect on periphyton photosynthesis, suggesting that the natural substrata do not produce water-soluble allelochemicals. Various modifications of the rod surfaces (roughening, wax coating, wax color) were used to test whether surficial properties of Scirpus culms influenced periphyton accumulation. Roughened rods supported levels of biomass similar to those of smooth rods, and both substrata developed structurally complex periphyton communities. Rods covered with paraffin wax had periphyton communities that were lower in biomass and structurally more simple than those on uncoated rods or on Scirpus culms. Coloring of the wax coating had no consistent effect on periphyton accumulation. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic cuticle on actively growing Scirpus culms retards the development of precursors for attachment by periphytic algae. Upon senescence of the culm and loss of epidermal integrity, colonization of culm surfaces by periphytic algae may occur in a manner similar to that on artificial substrata.																			0022-3646					APR	1991	27	2					196	206		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00196.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00196.x													WOS:A1991FH98300007

Effects of Reservoir Elevation and Spatial Synchrony on Walleye Recruitment in Lake Oahe, Missouri River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recruitment is an important driver of fish population abundance and size structure and can be affected by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. WalleyeSander vitreuspopulations often exhibit variable year-class strength, which has been attributed to a suite of factors. In this study, we quantified variability in Walleye recruitment, assessed within-lake recruitment synchrony, and modeled recruitment variability for year-classes that were produced from 1988 to 2013 in Lake Oahe, a large Missouri River reservoir. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether Walleye recruit annually, (2) whether Walleye recruitment is spatially synchronous, and (3) whether Walleye recruitment is better described by biotic or abiotic factors. The variability of Walleye recruitment was indexed by using gill-net catch of age-2 Walleye across nine locations in Lake Oahe, and factors affecting recruitment were evaluated by using stock-recruit analysis. Over the 26 years that were assessed, all year-classes were present and four exceptionally large year-classes were produced. Recruitment synchrony was apparent among locations within Lake Oahe, but this relationship was largely influenced by the spatial synchrony of the four exceptionally large year-classes and was no longer detectable when those year-classes were removed. The relative abundance of age-4 and older Walleye, taken as an index of spawner abundance, was a poor predictor of Walleye recruitment, indicating that Walleye recruitment was regulated by density-independent factors across the range of observations. The interactive effects of reservoir elevation and elevation change improved model fit to explain 59% of the recruitment variation and indicated that increased elevation from the previous year improved recruitment. Our results indicate that Walleye recruitment may be favored by increasing the water levels in the reservoir in spring.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2020	40	5					1133	1145		10.1002/nafm.10477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10477		SEP 2020											WOS:000565314100001

We present a high- resolution pollen record, spanning the past 9600 years, from Bande Lake, a shallow lake without glacial meltwater influx, in the source area of the Yangtze River on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our objectives were to reconstruct the regional vegetation history and to determine its drivers. The pollen assemblages are dominated by Artemisia, Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Amaranthaceae throughout, and three stages of regional vegetation change are documented: (i) During 9600-8300 cal yr BP the region was occupied by alpine steppe, dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae. (ii) During 8300-2200 cal yr BP, alpine steppe still dominated, while Cyperaceaedominated meadow expanded on the surrounding mountains, due to the descent of vegetation zones. (iii) After 2200 cal yr BP, Cyperaceae-dominated meadow expanded markedly on the surrounding mountains and reached its maximum extent, while marsh meadow occupied the area around the lake basin. Combined with other proxy records from the same core from Bande Lake, we conclude that this vegetation transformation was caused by the general cooling and drying climate during the past 9600 years, tracking the decline of Northern Hemisphere insolation. There is no evidence of human impacts on the regional vegetation around Bande Lake. Overall, our results indicate that temperature was the principal driver of late Holocene vegetation change in this region, while temperature-driven permafrost changes and specific terrain conditions may also have significantly influenced the development of the marsh meadow.

J	Taylor, BR; Helwig, J				Taylor, BR; Helwig, J			Submergent macrophytes in a cooling pond in Alberta, Canada	AQUATIC BOTANY												The structure of the aquatic macrophyte community and factors leading to high plant production were examined in a 450 ha cooling pond on the prairie of southern Alberta, Canada, that receives thermal effluent from a coal-fired electrical generating station. Late-summer standing crops, coverage and species composition were measured at intervals along ten transects perpendicular to the shore around the littoral zone of the pond. Physical and chemical features of the water column and sediments were measured concurrently to elucidate the factors controlling macrophyte growth. The cooling pond supported a simple but extraordinarily productive plant community dominated by species tolerant of high water temperatures and high concentrations of dissolved solids and alkalinity produced by evaporative concentration. Three of the seven dominant species are uncommon or seldom abundant in other lakes of the region but were apparently favoured here by high water temperatures, Standing crops of macrophytes at most points within the littoral zone were moderate (<100 g m(-2) dry mass), but were extremely high along the sheltered north and east shores (400-900 g m(-2)). The spatial distribution of species within the pond was evidently governed by (1) presence of suitable substratum, (2) light penetration, and (3) exposure to wave action. The situation in Sheerness cooling pond is comparable with that in other lakes receiving thermal effluent.																			0304-3770					AUG	1995	51	3-4					243	257		10.1016/0304-3770(95)00475-F	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(95)00475-F													WOS:A1995UD23100004

Four distinct depositional phases, from ca. 500 BCE to ca. 400 CE, were identified, aligning with the Roman Warm Period (RWP). The period from ca. 500 BCE to ca. 450 BCE shows high freshwater and marine planktic diatoms, augmented by silicoflagellates and terrestrial organic matter, with a low dinocyst presence, suggesting a dynamic aquatic environment. The period from ca. 450 BCE to ca. 350 BCE is marked by a high sand content, indicating significant runoff and terrestrial influx, along with increased freshwater and marine planktic diatoms and evidence of human activity in the area. Similarly, the period from ca. 350 BCE to ca. 50 CE is characterized by high sand content and strong anthropogenic influences, with a rise in silicoflagellates, pointing to rising sea levels and high monsoonal precipitation. The period from ca. 50 CE to ca. 400 CE initially shows a decrease in sand and an increase in mud, reflecting a weakening southwest monsoon, likely due to solar variations. However, from ca. 300 CE to ca. 400 CE, sand content rises again, accompanied by high terrestrial influx and dinocysts, while silicoflagellates diminish completely. Thus, despite the dominance of the RWP, the coastal region experienced an extended period of reduced monsoonal activity for a particular span.																			2571-550X					JAN 13	2025	8	1							3	10.3390/quat8010003	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat8010003													WOS:001452146500001

Sterile pupae were released from September 1997 to June 1998 from sand and vermiculite beds. A total of 24.6 million pupae were released with a male recapture rate of 0.101% (not corrected for adult emergence rate). Adult emergence rates were 25% at Tullibigeal; 39% at Ungarie and 46, 41, 71 and 54% respectively at 4 locations at Lake Cargelligo (mean 46%). Corrected recapture rates using cue-lure traps were 0.88% at Tullibigeal, 0.08% at Ungarie and 0.15% at Lake Cargelligo (mean 0.21%). When wild fly populations increased at Lake Cargelligo, a bait spraying program was used which substantially reduced the catches of both sterile and wild flies in traps. Analyses using the CLIMEX model showed that the climate at Lake Cargelligo town (with irrigation) was suitable for fruit flies. CLIMEX indicated that the unmodified rural environment was unsuitable for fruit fly survival due to a summer moisture deficit. The Meats daily survival rate decrement of 58-72% was similar to that found for some similar studies in Australia but lower than for certain other release programs. No significant bird or ant predation was observed.					; Dominiak, Bernie/S-8491-2019	McLeod, Lynette/0000-0001-9408-3342; 													0816-1089	1836-5787					2000	40	7					1021	1032		10.1071/EA99166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA99166													WOS:000165906100014

The effects on water chemistry, diatoms and fungal infection of the eggs of the moor frog were studied. After an initial treatment in March 1988, the pH increased from c. 4.0 to c. 5.0 in those pools which dried out in summer and to c. 6.0 in the permanent pools. Alkalinity increased from 0 to 20-200-mu-eq litre-1 in temporary pools and from 0 to 300-500-mu-eq litre-1 in permanent pools. As drying out of the pools caused reacidification, after refilling the temporary pools were relimed in March 1989. No significant changes were found in concentrations of phosphate and nitrogen compounds. Eunotia paludosa, which is characteristic for oligotrophic, very acid pools and bogs with a fluctuating water table, was the dominant diatom in the untreated pools. It was replaced by eutraphentic and saprophilous taxa, particularly in the permanent pools. Species from extremely soft waters, which are very sensitive to acidification, were found only occasionally in some samples from the treated permanent pools. After liming the proportion of infected moor frog eggs decreased from c. 95% in the untreated to c. 5% in the treated pools.

A 9170-year record of decadal-to-multi-centennial scale pluvial episodes from the coastal Southwest United States: a role for atmospheric rivers?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A well-dated, 9170 calendar year before present (cal yr BP) paleohydrologic reconstruction is presented from Lower Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains of the coastal southwest United States. This new multi-proxy record is characterized by alternating organic-rich/carbonate-rich sediment units, interpreted to reflect hydrologically-forced changes in the lake's depositional environment. Our interpretation of the proxy data indicates nine decadal-to-multi-centennial pluvial episodes (PE) over the past 9170 cal yr BP. Of these nine inferred pluvials, five are interpreted as more pronounced based on their combined proxy interpretations: (PE-V) 9170?-8250, (PE-IV) 7000-6400, (PE-III) 3350-3000, (PE-II) 850-700, and (PE-I) 500-476 (top of core) cal yr BP. The Lower Bear Lake record indicates that the San Bernardino Mountains, source region for the Mojave River and its terminal playa, was wet during the same periods (within dating errors), to several of the major pluvials proposed from the lakes in the sink of the Mojave River. Our comparison extends north also to Tulare Lake, which drains the southcentral-western Sierra Nevada Mountains. This temporally and spatially coherent signal indicates that a similar climate forcing acted to increase regional wetness at various times during the past 9170 cal yr BP. As originally proposed by Enzel. Ely, and colleagues (e.g., Enzel et al., 1989; Enzel, 1992; Ely et al., 1994; Enzel and Wells, 1997), we too contend that Holocene pluvial episodes are associated with changing the frequency of large winter storms that track across a broad region at decadal-to-multi-centennial timescales. We build upon their hypothesis through the addition of new and better-dated site comparisons, recent advances in the understanding of atmospheric rivers, and improved knowledge of the ocean-atmosphere dynamics that caused the early 20th century western United States pluvial.

Stratigraphy and Sedimentology of the Paleoproterozoic Thluicho Lake Group, Southwestern Rae Province, Canada: Alluvial Basin Development in the Hinterland of the Taltson Orogen	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The Thluicho Lake Group is a middle-Paleoproterozoic succession of greenschist-facies continental clastic rocks that was deposited on variably mylonitized crystalline basement rocks in the southwestern Rae Province of the Canadian Shield, near the end of 2.02-1.92-Ga Thelon-Taltson orogenesis. Two informal formations are proposed for this fining-upward succession. The Powder Lake formation comprises predominantly coarse-grained rocks including conglomerate (Gulo Lake member), pebbly sandstone (Camel Lake member), and sandstone (Wellington Lake member), whereas the overlying Camsell Portage formation consists of sandstone to siltstone (Falls member), rhythmic sandstone and argillite (Waterloo Lake member), and argillite (Slate Island member). The two informal formations represent two principal facies associations: a lower conglomerate-sandstone facies association representing an alluvial fan to distal braided plain that underwent episodic flash flooding events and an upper sandstone siltstone-mudstone facies association representing a lacustrine environment. The Thluicho Lake basins are interpreted to have been symmetrical and elongate, and are broadly parallel to older, west-to northwest-trending basement structures. Transverse alluvial fans and braided rivers and/or fan deltas developed on elevated basin margins and drained into a large perennial lake. Similarities in lithology, age, and provenance suggest that the Thluicho Lake Group may correlate with the more extensive Nonacho Group to the north. Both groups represent remnants of a strike-slip and intermontane basin system that formed in the hinterland of the Taltson orogen at ca. 1.92 Ga.																			0022-1376	1537-5269				SEP	2010	118	5					487	508		10.1086/655373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/655373													WOS:000281142900003

An acidification episode is defined as a hydrological event during which ANC decreases. The pre-episode ANC is used to index the antecedent condition, and the stream flow increase reflects how much the relative contributions of sources of waters change during the episode. As much as 92% of the total variation in the minimum ANC in individual catchments can be explained (with levels of explanation >70% far nine of the 13 streams) by a multiple linear regression model that includes pre-episode ANC and change in discharge as independent variables. The predictive scheme is demonstrated to be regionally robust, with the regional variance explained ranging from 77 to 83%. The scheme is not successful for each ERP stream, and reasons are suggested for the individual failures. The potential for applying the predictive scheme to other watersheds is demonstrated by testing the model with data from the Panola Mountain Research Watershed in the South-eastern United States, where the variance explained by the model was 74%. The model can also be utilized to assess 'chemically new' and 'chemically old' water sources during acidification episodes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Lake-water-temperature regulation under diurnal and annual cycles of environmental forcing, Agamon Hula, Israel	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake-water temperature regulation responds to annual and diurnal cycles of environmental forcing (radiation, wind speed, and air properties) through heat exchange, balancing stored heat with incoming and outgoing fluxes. Given the critical role of temperature response in influencing the ecological resilience and biogeochemical cycles of lakes, it requires precise mathematical expression based on direct observation. Here, this is addressed by accurately determining the equilibrium temperature, achieved when changes in stored heat are negligible, and its dependence on environmental forcing. Water temperature gradually approaches equilibrium, with a certain response time that depends on lake depth and wind velocities. The dynamics between water and equilibrium temperature and their corresponding surface heat fluxes are controlled by the ratio between the lake's thermal response time to the environmental forcing timescale. The unique role of this ratio was examined using two years of continuous direct measurements from an eddy covariance tower at Agamon Hula, a shallow lake in northern Israel. Our results reveal that the lakes thermal response time is similar to 1 day. Consequently, water temperature closely follows the equilibrium temperature at the intra-annual cycle, and deviates from equilibrium under the diurnal cycle. This agrees well with the measured heat fluxes, where under the intra-annual cycle, incoming radiation is balanced mainly by evaporation and changes in stored heat are negligible, as opposed to large oscillations in heat storage under the diurnal cycle. We leverage the results to study expected annual water temperatures under different environmental scenarios, and the role lake depth has on diurnal water temperatures.

Inland waters are becoming increasingly important for leisure and tourism, with many activities associated and many users seeking for them. Fluvial beaches represent leisure facilities for rural communities, allowing people and visitors access to aquatic spaces for leisure, sport and entertainment, creating conditions for enjoying nature and water resources, particularly during the summer period. The supply of surface water resources - rivers, lakes and canals - in the territory of the Estrela Geopark in Portugal, represent a tourist potential for this mountain region. They qualify the offer and constitute recreational attractions appreciated by the community and tourists, generating social well-being and fostering new services. There is a growing demand for these spaces, allowing the upgrading of fluvial areas, generating new features and enhancing the image of the destination Serra da estrela. The greater part of this equipment is operated by public entities linked to local administration, thus benefiting from public investment and support. There is a strong perception of its importance in attracting tourists, in improving the quality of life of the local population and in the opportunity to expand trade and service activities. Also in the image of the community, and their self-esteem is perceived, the importance of river beaches and consequently the disclosure that they associate, in terms of environmental quality, heritage value, and space of tranquillity.

Up to now, there has been little information available on heterotrophic bacterial abundance, production, and their controlling factors in these ecosystems. In the present study the main environmental factors responsible for the control of the heterotrophic bacterial community in five shallow soda pools in Eastern Austria were investigated during an annual cycle. Extremely high cyanobacterial numbers and heterotrophic bacterial numbers up to 307 x 10(9) L-1 and 268 x 10(9) L-1 were found, respectively. Bacterial secondary production rates up to 738 mug C L-1 h(-1) and specific growth rates up to 1.65 h(-1) were recorded in summer and represent the highest reported values for natural aquatic ecosystems. The combination of dense phytoplankton blooms, high temperature, high turbidity, and nutrient concentration due to evaporation is supposed to enable the development of such extremely productive microbial populations. By principal component analysis containing the data set of all five investigated pools, two factors were extracted which explained 62.5% of the total variation of the systems. The first factor could be interpreted as a turbidity factor; the second was assigned to as concentration factor. From this it was deduced that bacterial and cyanobacterial abundance were mainly controlled by wind-induced sediment resuspension and turbidity stabilized by the high pH and salinity and less by evaporative concentration of salinity and dissolved organic carbon. Bacterial production was clustered with temperature in factor 3, showing that bacterial growth was mainly controlled by temperature. The concept of describing the turbid water columns of the shallow soda pools as "fluid sediment" is discussed.

Land cover influences on juvenile Rainbow Trout diet composition and condition in Lake Michigan tributaries	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Watershed development may alter tributaries in ways that influence the growth and development of juvenile fish. For Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, the extent of land cover influence on the diet composition of stream-residing juveniles is still an open but important question, particularly given their broad global distribution. Our study evaluated the effect of land cover on diet composition and condition metrics of juvenile Rainbow Trout in Lake Michigan tributaries. Juveniles were collected in the fall of 2014 and 2015 from 18 sampling locations across the Lake Michigan basin and included a wide variety of land cover types. Multivariate statistical procedures were used to quantitatively score sites along axes that maximized variation in land cover and diet composition. Subsequently, Spearman's rank correlations were used to test for significance of correlations between (a) land cover and diet composition, (b) land cover and fish condition, and (c) diet composition and fish condition. Our results indicated that land cover had an influence on the diet compositions of juvenile Rainbow Trout, but neither land cover nor diet composition had a significant influence on Rainbow Trout condition. These findings contrast with previously published work focusing on the growth responses of other fish species and provide insight into the plastic nature of Rainbow Trout. Further, we discuss potential ways in which fish may mitigate the effect of land cover changes as they are transmitted through stream food webs; however, the magnitude of the mitigation likely varies among fish species.

Limnology and diatom ecology of shallow lakes in a rapidly thawing discontinuous permafrost peatland	INLAND WATERS												Lakes in discontinuous permafrost peatlands are on the front lines of climate change, sensitive to even modest increases in air temperature. The aim of this study was to provide the first limnological characterization of shallow (similar to 1-2 m depth) lakes in the Scotty Creek basin (Northwest Territories, Canada), a field site of circumpolar significance due to the existence of long-term ecohydrological monitoring going back decades. We use this previous work as a foundation to advance our process-based understanding of the potential drivers of lake ecosystem change. Our results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and lake color were not correlated, a pattern that seems to be an important driver of diatom (siliceous single-celled algae) assemblages in these lakes. Diatoms in the study lakes tended to fall into 1 of 2 assemblage clusters. One cluster, composed of small benthic Fragilariaceae and small Navicula species (sensu lato), was found associated with higher lake color; the second cluster, composed of Encyonopsis and large Navicula species, was found associated with high DOC, lower color, and the presence of a benthic moss mat. From this finding, we suggest that DOC quality is a primary control on lake ecology in this region for its role in controlling light penetration to the lake bottom. Our hypothesis that the prevalence of nearshore fens and collapse scar wetlands would be important drivers of DOC was not supported in the 9 study lakes with available data to map shoreline features.

Herein, we report a nanofluidic biosensor integrating polydopamine-functionalized graphene oxide (PDA/GO) membranes with an entropy-driven DNA circuit and hyperbranched DNA nanowires (HDW) for femtomolar-level E2 quantification. Leveraging E2-specific aptamer recognition, the system triggers an entropy-driven DNA circuit and subsequent hierarchical assembly of guanine quadruplex (G4)-enriched HDW nanostructures on nanochannel surfaces, amplifying interfacial electronegativity through phosphate backbone accumulation. This charge amplification synergizes with subnanometer-confined ion transport modulation, achieving an 8.19-fold current enhancement upon E2 binding. The optimized biosensor exhibited a linear dynamic range spanning five orders (1 fM to 100 pM) with a detection limit of 0.39 fM, comparable to conventional LC-MS/MS for the analysis of E2. Rigorous specificity testing demonstrated high anti-interference against structural analogs and endocrine disruptors. Practical validation in real water samples (Yellow River, Heihu Spring, Qian Lake, and an aquaculture pond) demonstrated recovery rates of 91.2-109%, supported by robust stability and environmental resilience. This work establishes nucleic acid nanotechnology-enhanced nanofluidics, addressing critical gaps in on-site endocrine disruptor monitoring through synergistic molecular recognition and interfacial charge engineering.

Hot-spring inputs and climate drive dynamic shifts in archaeal communities in Lake Magadi, Kenya Rift Valley	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The methane index (MI) is an organic geochemical index that uses isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) as a proxy for methane cycling. Here, we report results from sediments in core MAG14-2A that span almost 500 ka in Lake Magadi, Kenya. The deposits show abrupt shifts between high and low MI values through calcareous, tuffaceous and zeolitic silts. The MI switches "off" (MI < 0.2) and "on" (MI > 0.5) through the core with bulk organic matter enriched in 13C during "MI-off" periods (similar to -18 parts per thousand) in the upper part of the core, whereas C-13 is lower (-22 parts per thousand to -25 parts per thousand) in lower parts of the sedimentary sequence. Sediments deposited when the MI switches "on" showed delta 13COM values as low as -89.4 parts per thousand, but most values were within the range of -28 parts per thousand to -30 parts per thousand, which is consistent with contributions from methanogens rather than methanotrophs. Thus, the likely source of these high MI values in Lake Magadi is methanogenic archaea. Our results show that hydrothermal inputs of bicarbonate-rich waters into Lake Magadi combined with further evaporative concentration cause a shift in the dominant archaeal communities, alternating between two stable states.

Five of the remaining opencast mine sites will cease mining between 2020 and 2055. In the scope of the reclamation work, it is expected to flood the residual pits of all these mines with water. The lake created will have a number of certain common features, but will be dominated by many specific features. The basic problem will be sufficient water for flooding. The most difficult situation will be at the Bilina opencast mine site. There is a whole complex of problems to be solved to achieve an optimal state. The company R-Princip is involved in the national task of developing science and technology, which formulates options and links development of new lakes in the context of the overall hydrological situation of the region. The issues to solve are discharge flow or non-through flow of the lake, choosing the optimal level, water-resource balance, shoreline protection from abrasion caused by high waves, geotechnical slope stability of the lake, technology of active mining and dumping operations to achieve optimal morphology of the lake and its surroundings, lake links to the water systems of abandoned old mining workings, security of thermal springs and mineral waters, etc.																					978-80-213-2076-5				2010							523	528																WOS:000287422700064

ACTIVE THERMOKARST ZONES ON PERMAFROST TERRITORY AND THEIR DETECTING ON SPACE IMAGES	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the paper is caused by the need to develop methods of identifying and mapping the areas of active thermokarst processes on the permafrost territory, based on satellite images and geoin formation technologies in the context of assessing the accumulation of methane in thermokarst lakes, which are considered as the most active sources of methane emissions into the atmosphere in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in the global warming of recent decades. The main aim of the study is to develop methodical questions to identify areas of distribution of thermokarst lakes in permafrost and map their boundaries, based on remote sensing and GIS tools. Methods used in the study: remote sensing of the thermokarst lakes spatial structure, including the little-studied small lakes, using satellite images of middle and high spatial resolution; methods of geographic information systems for spatial and statistical analysis of satellite images of fields of thermokarst lakes in the frozen thermokarst landscapes. The results. The authors developed methodical questions and described the procedure of active thermokarst zones detection as the areas of the dissemination of thermokarst lakes in the frozen landscape and determination of the boundaries of these zones based on Landsat-8 images and Kanopus-V high resolution images. A collection of Landsat-8 and Kanopus-V images obtained in summer of 2013-2014 was also formed. Using the developed methodology, the authors defined the boundaries and developed the map of active thermokarst zones on the territory of the discontinuous permafrost of Western Siberia.

The results showed: (1) A total of 198 species of phytoplankton and 58 species of metazoan zooplankton were recorded. (2) Cyanobacteria had the highest cell density among phytoplankton, while rotifers dominated in zooplankton density. (3) The highest alpha-diversity of plankton communities was observed in the shallow lakes connected to the Yangtze River. (4) The phytoplankton cell density in Meishan Reservoir (M), which is surrounded by broadleaf forests, is significantly higher than that in Huating Reservoir (HT), which is surrounded by coniferous forests. (5) In the secondary tributaries of the Huaihe River, Cryptophyta and Dinophyta are now the dominant species. Parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and electrical conductivity (EC) play critical roles in regulating the composition and abundance of plankton communities. The rich aquatic vegetation and diverse habitats of Shengjin Lake(SJ), a shallow lake connected to the Yangtze River, promote the development of plankton. Broadleaf forest vegetation that surround reservoirs, compared to coniferous forests, promote more algal growth and development indirectly by increasing nutrient levels in the water. The findings provide data support for understanding the mechanisms influencing plankton community structures in typical water bodies in eastern China and offer valuable references for water quality management and algal bloom control.																				2950-5097				FEB	2025	45	1					239	247		10.1016/j.ecofro.2024.10.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecofro.2024.10.013													WOS:001399092300001

In 2009, El'gygytgyn was the target of a drilling project of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), and in summer 2011 it was investigated further by a Russian-German expedition. Drill core material and surface samples, including volcanic target rocks and impactites, have been investigated by various geochemical techniques in order to improve the record of trace element characteristics for these lithologies and to attempt to detect and constrain a possible meteoritic component. The bedrock units of the ICDP drill core reflect the felsic volcanics that are predominant in the crater vicinity. The overlying suevites comprise a mixture of all currently known target lithologies, dominated by felsic rocks but lacking a discernable meteoritic component based on platinum group element abundances. The reworked suevite, directly overlain by lake sediments, is not only comparatively enriched in shocked minerals and impact glass spherules, but also contains the highest concentrations of Os, Ir, Ru, and Rh compared to other El'gygytgyn impactites. This isto a lesser extentthe result of admixture of a mafic component, but more likely the signature of a chondritic meteoritic component. However, the highly siderophile element contribution from target material akin to the mafic blocks of the ICDP drill core to the impactites remains poorly constrained.					; Reimold, Wolf/AAI-6226-2021	Koeberl, Christian/0000-0001-5155-7405; Reimold, Wolf Uwe/0000-0001-6588-0887; McDonald, Iain/0000-0001-9066-7244; Hauser, Natalia/0000-0002-6975-6186													1086-9379	1945-5100				JUN	2015	50	6					1071	1088		10.1111/maps.12455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12455													WOS:000355276100005

Our palynological data, augmented by quantitative pollen-based climate reconstructions, provide insight into the vegetation dynamics and thus also climate variability in SE Europe during one of the best orbital analogues for the Holocene. Comparison of our palynological results with other proxy data from Lake Ohrid as well as with regional and global climate records shows that the vegetation in SE Europe responded sensitively both to long-and short-term climate change during MIS 11. The chronology of our palynological record is based on orbital tuning, and is further supported by the detection of a new tephra from the Vico volcano, central Italy, dated to 410 +/- 2 ka. Our study indicates that MIS 11c (similar to 424-398 ka) was the warmest interval of MIS 11. The younger part of the interglacial (i.e., MIS 11b-11a;similar to 398-367 ka) exhibits a gradual cooling trend passing over into MIS 10. It is characterized by considerable millennial scale variability as inferred by six abrupt forest-contraction events. Interestingly, the first forest contraction occurred during full interglacial conditions of MIS 11c; this event lasted for similar to 1.7 kyrs (406.2 -404.5 ka) and was characterized by substantial reductions in winter temperature and annual precipitation. Most notably, it occurred similar to 7 ka before the end of MIS 11c and similar to 15 ka before the first strong ice-rafted debris event in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that millennial-scale climate variability during MIS 11 was established in Southern Europe already during MIS 11c, which is earlier than in the North Atlantic where it is registered only from MIS 11b onwards.

J	Liu, H; Wang, SZ; Wang, HY; Cao, YN; Hu, J; Liu, WG				Liu, Hu; Wang, Sizhuang; Wang, Huanye; Cao, Yunning; Hu, Jing; Liu, Weiguo			Apparent fractionation of hydrogen isotope from precipitation to leaf wax n-alkanes from natural environments and manipulation experiments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Knowledge of hydrogen isotopic fractionation (c) of plant leaf waxes is the foundation for applying hydrogen isotope values (82H) in environmental reconstructions. In this work, we systematically investigated plant c values (calk/precipitation, calk/soil water, calk/leaf water and calk/lake water, representing the isotopic fractionation between plant n-alkane 82H and precip-itation 82H, soil water 82H, leaf water 82H and lake water 82H) from the natural environments and manipulation exper-iments. The results show that the calk/precipitation values of terrestrial plants have large variations (from -190 %o to -20 %o) and become more negative with increasing aridity index. This phenomenon is possibly caused by the 82H changes in source water (from precipitation to soil water and then to leaf water) during plant leaf wax synthesis under various evapotranspiration conditions in different climatic zones. The rainfall manipulation experiments show that leaf water 82H values are generally higher than soil water 82H values, and the latter are higher than precip-itation 82H values. This finding further demonstrates that the evapotranspiration effect on source water 82H affects the quantification of the leaf wax apparent c values (calk/leaf water < calk/soil water < calk/precipitation). The calk/lake water values of submerged plants display a smaller range (-153 +/- 5 %o) than the calk/precipitation values of terrestrial plants, which is close to the terrestrial calk/precipitation values in humid areas. Therefore, the biosynthetic c value of terrestrial plant leaf waxes is relatively constant (ca. -153 +/- 5 parts per thousand), and the observed variable apparent Calk/precipitation values are possibly caused by the varied degree of evapotranspiration effect on the water that plants used in different climatic conditions. This effect should be considered when applying 82H values of leaf waxes to trace environmental changes.

Success in this venture requires better constrained palaeoenvironmental reconstructions than have been achieved thus far, and the TIGGER project focused. in particular, on three main aims: (1)off-setting the limitations of conventional radiocarbon dating, in order to provide a more secure chronology of events; (2) increasing the resolution and precision of palaeoclimatic reconstructions; (3) widening the scope of site-specific palaeoecological investigations. In this paper we focus on the first of these strategies, and describe the progress made in developing a more coherent timescale for the climate history of the Lateglacial period. This has been achieved by using a number of independent methods, including calibration of AMS radiocarbon dates obtained from terrestrial plant macrofossils, MCR estimates of summer temperatures based on coleopteran records. analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios in terrestrial plant macrofossils and tephrochronology. Following Bjorck et tri.'s 1998 recommendations. we integrate the new results to construct a provisional event stratigraphy for the Last Glacial-Holocene transition in the British Isles, which is based on a sequence of features that are believed to be time-parallel. This approach is considered to provide a more coherent Framework for direct comparison of the palaeoenvironmental evidence from Britain with that from elsewhere.

We have investigated its hydrothermal system by conducting audio-magnetotelluric soundings at 22 stations along a profile that extends across the volcano. The final two-dimensional model is characterized by two conductors. One is a 300- to 1000-m-thick conductor of 1-10 Omega m, which is located on the eastern slope and covered with 200-m-thick resistive layers of Kusatsu-Shirane lava and pyroclastics. This conductor indicates the presence of a Montmorillonite-rich layer of Pliocene volcanic rocks that may function both as an impermeable floor for the shallow fluid path from the peak to the hot springs to the east and as an impermeable cap for the deeper fluid path from the summit region to the foot of the volcano. The second conductor is found at a depth of 1-2 km from the surface, at the peak of the volcano, and its resistivity is as low as 1 Omega m or less. This low resistivity can be explained by fluids containing high concentrations of chloride and sulfate which were supplied from the magmatic gases. Micro-earthquakes cluster above this conductor, and the cut-off of the earthquakes corresponds to the top of the conductor. This conductor infers the presence of the fluid reservoir, and the upward release of these fluids from the reservoir through the conduit presumably triggers the micro-earthquakes at the peak area of the volcano. Crustal deformation modeling using GPS and leveling data of the past 10 years revealed that the center of the deflation coincides with the top of the second conductor, indicating that the fluid reservoir itself can be hosting the deformation.

Trace metals were added to grazing (lake water <210 mu m) and control (lake water <0.2 mu m) treatments in the form of radiolabeled Synechococcus. Picoplankton (0.2-3 mu m) were grazed heavily by consumers in the nanoplankton (3-20 mu m) and microplankton (20-210 mu m) size classes (collectively referred to as microzooplankton) as confirmed by dilution assays used to independently measure grazing activity. Most consumed trace metals were regenerated into the dissolved phase (<0.2 mu m), but some trophic transfer of Cd-109 and Zn-65 from radiolabeled prey into the nanoplankton and microplankton did occur: Zn-65 was transferred 2.5 times more efficiently into the microplankton and 2.9 times more efficiently into the nanoplankton than was Cd-109. Recycling of regenerated Cd-109 back into plankton biomass was greater than that for Zn-65. Grazing by microzooplankton influenced the molecular size distribution of regenerated trace metal in the dissolved phase (77+/-6% Cd-109 <5,000 MW; 8+/-24% Zn-65 <5,000 MW). These results show that microzooplankton grazing tends to prolong the residence times of metals such as Cd and Zn in the pelagic surface waters of large lakes.

Limisphaera ngatamarikiensis gen. nov., sp nov., a thermophilic, pink-pigmented coccus isolated from subaqueous mud of a geothermal hotspring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel bacterial strain, NGM72.4(T), was isolated from a hot spring in the Ngatamariki geothermal field, New Zealand. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences grouped it into the phylum Verrucomicrobia and class level group 3 (also known as OPB35 soil group). NGM72.4(T) stained Gram-negative, and was catalase- and oxidase-positive. Cells were small cocci, 0.5-0.8 mu m in diameter, which were motile by means of single flagella. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) imaging showed an unusual pirellulosome-like intracytoplasmic membrane. The peptidoglycan content was very small with only trace levels of diaminopimelic acid detected. No peptidoglycan structure was visible in TEM imaging. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7 (92%). The major fatty acids (>15 %) were C-16:0, anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. Major phospholipids were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylmo-nomethylethanolamine (PMME) and cardiolipin (CL), and a novel analogous series of phospholipids where diacylglycerol was replaced with diacylserinol (sPE, sPMME, sCL.). The DNA G+C content was 65.6 mol%. Cells displayed an oxidative chemoheterotrophic metabolism. NGM72.4(T) is a strictly aerobic thermophile (growth optimum 60-65 degrees C), has a slightly alkaliphilic pH growth optimum (optimum pH 8.1-8.4) and has a NaCl tolerance of up to 8 g l(-1). Colonies were small, circular and pigmented pale pink. The distinct phylogenetic position and phenotypic traits of strain NGM72.4(T) distinguish it from all other described species of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and, therefore, it is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus for which we propose the name Limisphaera ngatamarikiensis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is NGM72.4(T) (=ICMP 20182(T)=DSM 27329(T)).

Beside the constant saline waste water load, two massive brine spills loaded the lake with additional 16,900 tons sodium chloride (a parts per thousand 10,250 tons Cl(-)) from 1977 to 1979 and 3,000 tons salt (a parts per thousand 1,820 tons Cl(-)) in 2005. The effect of waste water intrusions from salt mining on stratification of Lake Hallstattersee was analysed over a period of 40 years. Water density, dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured and an exponential model was fitted to describe the wash-out of chloride from Lake Hallstattersee after the brine spills. Furthermore, the time required returning to holomixis and steady chloride content after the second brine spill was estimated. During the whole sampling period the minimum and maximum volume-weighted annual mean chloride concentrations were 23.58 mg/L in 1979 and 3.19 mg/L in 1998. However, the mixing regime of Lake Hallstattersee, as well as the chloride concentrations, varied considerably and exhibited three holomictic and three meromictic periods between 1970 and 2009. Holomictic periods were observed when the yearly density gradient was below 0.06 kg/m(3), deepwater oxygen in spring above 4 mg/L and consequently declining TP concentration in the deepest water layer below 60 mg/m(3), otherwise meromictic periods were observed. Our study showed that Hallstattersee was 13 years ectogenic meromictic and 27 years holomictic during the study period.

Reconstruction of climate and glacial history based on a comparison of varve and tree-ring records from Mirror Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study compared the hydroclimatic signals recorded in annually laminated (varved) sediments and tree rings within a small study area in the Selwyn Mountains of the southwestern Northwest Territories/southeastern Yukon Territory border region of Canada. The records were located immediately adjacent to each other and within 6 km of instrumental meteorological and hydrometric records, which permitted a detailed analysis of climate in the area from AD 1704 to 1996. This study explored the challenges of annually-resolved multi-proxy hydroclimate analyses and examined how best to interpret the climate record given the differences in proxy formation and the respective signals. The high-frequency (annual) variability from both proxies showed a good match for some parts of the record (e.g., mid-1700s and much of the 1900s) but revealed different sensitivities at other times (e.g., 1800s). However, both records contained a common low-frequency (decadal) summer climate signal. Glacier dynamics influenced varve formation through altered sediment availability during the inferred Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum ice stand in the catchment from AD 1778 to 1892 and subsequent recession after this maximum. As a result of reduced LIA sedimentation, July mean temperatures reconstructed from varve thickness during the 1800s were underestimated compared to the tree-ring estimates. Other instances of low-frequency divergence were apparent, particularly during parts of the twentieth century, despite the overall similarities. The extended varve record also provided a glacial history for the southern Selwyn Mountains, indicating probable glacier advances during AD 1300-1450 and AD 1600-1670, maximum ice stand during the 1800s, followed by twentieth-century recession.

J	Peters, L; Traunspurger, W; Wetzel, MA; Rothhaupt, KO				Peters, L; Traunspurger, W; Wetzel, MA; Rothhaupt, KO			Community development of free-living aquatic nematodes in littoral periphyton communities	NEMATOLOGY												The development of an epilithic nematode Community and the mode of colonisation was monitored over a 57-day period during spring in a field experiment in the littoral zone of a large oligotrophic lake. Two types of experimental units were used: one type prohibited direct colonisation via active crawling by elevating substrates into the water column and the second type had substrates placed on the lake bottom. Data from the two types of units and from nearby natural hard substrates were compared. The nematodes quickly colonised on the introduced substrates and reached maximum densities of 123 individuals per 10 cm(2) after 57 days. Nematode densities on elevated and non-elevated substrates did not differ significantly. The nematode abundance and community Structure showed a large initial variation, but became more stable over time and resembled the natural community structure at the end of the experiment. The maximum number of nematode species was reached after 2 weeks of colonisation, with a maximum species number on days 12 and 14 in the experimental units and on day 19 on the surrounding natural hard substrates. The five numerically dominant species, Eumonhystera vulgaris, Chromadorina bioculata, Eumonhystera filiformis, Chromadorina viridis and Daptonema dubium, accounted for most of the variation between the different communities. The results indicate that water-column transport was the main colonisation pathway of epilithic nematodes. The distribution of nematode species points to potential morphological adaptations of some species for persistence on hard substrates.

An example is the sudden drainage on 8 August 2019 of the Toguz-Bulak glacial lake in the Tosor river basin of the northern Tien Shan region. In this study, we used remote sensing and field surveys to examine the reasons for the outburst. We found that the lake area changed from 0.021 km(2) to 0.002 km(2) due to the outburst, in which most of the initial 130,000 m(3) of water discharged within four hours. In examining the longer-term behavior of this lake, we found that from 2010 through 2019, it appears in June and disappears in September every year. Its maximum area occurs in late July and early August. With the expansion of the lake basin between 2010 and 2019, the lake also increased greatly in size, particularly so in the three years before the outburst, linked to high summer temperatures and the resulting higher inflow of glacier meltwater, finally leading to the sudden drainage in 2019. Before this outburst, a 2-m high moraine dam retained the lake. Continuously inflowing meltwater and the related increasing pressure by the lake water mass eventually broke the moraine dam. Satellite radar interferometry revealed active displacement fringes in the lake basin and moraine dam due to the melting and subsidence of buried ice. An analysis using digital elevation models from 1964 and 2010 also confirms the surface lowering in the lake basin by up to 8.5 m and on the moraine dam by 2 m. Such lowering of the proglacial moraine complex destabilized the moraine dam.					; Daiyrov, Mirlan/AAH-8589-2019	Narama, Chiyuki/0000-0002-8233-9053; Daiyrov, Mirlan/0000-0002-1489-5090; Tadono, Takeo/0000-0003-4313-5645; 														2076-3263				NOV	2020	10	11							468	10.3390/geosciences10110468	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences10110468													WOS:000593408600001
J	Hannan, JC; Williams, RJ				Hannan, JC; Williams, RJ			Recruitment of juvenile marine fishes to seagrass habitat in a temperate Australian estuary	ESTUARIES												We investigated the relationship between distance from the ocean and the recruitment of ocean-spawned juvenile fish to seagrass shallows within marine dominated Lake Macquarie, a coastal barrier lagoon in Southeast Aus tralia. Samples were taken by seine net every 6 wk between June 1986 and June 1987, at 20 sites established at various distances from the entrance channel. The fish fauna was diverse: 80 species from 39 families were caught, with the Gobiidae, Monacanthidae, Syngnathidae, Tetraodontidae, Mugilidae, Atherinidae, Clupeidae, Mullidae, Sparidae, and Blenniidae being web represented. Ambassis jacksoniensis, Atherinomorus ogilbyi, and Gerres subfasciatus accounted for 46% of all individuals. Thirty-two species were classified as ocean spawners, 38 as lagoon spawners, and 10 as unknown in terms of spawning area. Newly settled juveniles of ocean spawners were concentrated near the lagoon's entrance, where most recruited in spring. This pattern occurred in the absence of a salinity gradient: distance from the ocean coupled with weak internal water circulation appears to limit larval distribution and hence juvenile recruitment. Small juveniles of Rhabdosargus sarba were sufficiently abundant for their subsequent dispersal to be directly traced. On the basis of results for this species, and indirect evidence of dispersal for several others, it is suggested that ocean-spawned juveniles, after settling near the entrance, gradually disperse as they grow and change their habitat. Thus, further from the entrance, their recruitment to seagrass shallows is later, at larger sizes, and in smaller numbers. Newly settled juveniles of lagoon spawners, however, were widely distributed within the lagoon. The optimal recruitment of ocean-spawned juveniles to similar coastal lagoons may depend on suitable habitat being available near the entrance.																			0160-8347					MAR	1998	21	1					29	51		10.2307/1352545	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352545													WOS:000072589400003

They are also important food items for many fish and benthivorous seabirds. It has commonly been thought that predation pressure on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations is negligible in the Baltic Sea, owing to the scarcity of major invertebrate predators such as starfish and crabs. It has recently been shown, however, that the blue mussel is the main food item for roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, where this freshwater fish species has become increasingly abundant, mainly due to increased eutrophication. To quantify the influence of roach predation on blue mussel populations we measured the standing biomass and size structure of the local blue mussel population and used a bioenergetic model to estimate mussel consumption by individual roach during two consecutive summers, 1997 and 1998. The results of the model were combined with existing data on roach abundance, giving annual consumption estimates of 75-105 kg blue mussel dry weight ha(-1) in the study area, approximately two-thirds of these consumed mussels being > 10 mm. This corresponds to approximately one-third of the standing population of mussels > 10 mm in the area. Our results suggest that the predation effects of vertebrates on Baltic blue mussel populations are not insignificant, as previously believed. Predation by roach and other predators may have an important structuring effect on unstable blue mussel communities within the Gulf of Finland, where the species lives at the edge of its range.

Age and Dynamics of the Lithalsa in the Sentsa River Valley, Eastern Sayan, Based on 14С Dating and Isotope-Geochemical Methods	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Lithalsas are found on mires in the discontinuous permafrost in the circumpolar area of the northern hemisphere and in mountainous regions. The age and growth mechanism of lithalsa in the continental intermountain region of the East Sayan Mountains were uncertain and debated. We represent the results of a detailed analysis of four representative lithalsas, including 14C dating, C-N content of buried peat lenses, and organic matter from soils, as well as results of stable isotope measurements (delta 18O and delta 2H) in the lithalsas' ice lenses. It was found that the studied lithalsas are not older than 600 years; the youngest mound began to form about 170 years BP. Main water sources for lithalsa ice formation were shallow lakes and the Sentsa River during spring floodings; freezing occurred mainly in open system conditions. However, the rate of freezing ice lens was not the same for the studied lithalsas, as well as the rate of their growth. Multiple freezing cycles were established for the highest lithalsa. High values of the C/N ratio in organic and peat horizons allow us to suppose the rapid freezing of organic matter during lithalsa growth. The findings confirm that non-climatic factors, like flooding, are crucial for lithalsa dynamics.

Interaction of pans and groundwater: A case study in the Khakhea- Bray Transboundary aquifer portion in South Africa	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Understanding the groundwater-surface water interaction is important for the sustainable management of water resources and ecology. Most of the studies on groundwater-surface interactions are confined to aquifer-river and aquifer-lake interactions. The interactions of water pans and groundwater have not received much attention. The study aims to provide insights into the interaction of the pans and groundwater at a case study in the KhakheaBray dolomite Transboundary Aquifer (TBA) shared by Botswana and South Africa. The study uses field observations, geology, hydrogeophysics, and stable isotopes complimentary tools. Complimentary tools provide several evidence to corroborate the findings. The hydrogeophysics taps into the recently developed Telluric Electric Frequency Selection Method (TEFSM). Groundwater discharge zones/springs were delineated at the geological contact of the boundary of the Khakhea-Bray dolomite transboundary aquifer and the granite of the Kalahari group. 4 of the 33 research pans are in the groundwater discharge zone and are classified as groundwater dependent. The findings highlight the benefits of complimentary approaches to corroborate the findings on groundwater-surface water interactions. The TEFSM hydrogeophysics can be able to delineate groundwater discharge zones, aquifer boundaries, and the mapping of TBAs. More studies are recommended to test the TEFSM hydrogeophysical approach to study groundwater-surface water in different hydrological environments.					; Gomo, Modreck/AAI-3094-2020	Gomo, Modreck/0000-0003-3205-3097; 													1474-7065	1873-5193				DEC	2024	136								103753	10.1016/j.pce.2024.103753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2024.103753		OCT 2024											WOS:001332975700001

Hypothesis On The Source, Transmission and Characteristics of Infection of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Virus - Based On Analysis of Field Epidemiological Investigation and Gene Sequence Analysis	ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH												On 31 March 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with influenza A (H7N9) virus had occurred in Shanghai and Anhui provinces, China. H7N9 cases were later detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was estimated that the virus first spread northward along the route taken by migratory birds and then spread to neighbouring provinces with the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies were carried out on samples from the external environment of infected cases, transmission routes, farmers markets and live poultry markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combined with the virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible that the virus was transmitted by local wildfowl to domestic poultry and then to humans, or spread further by means of trading in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has turned warm, and with measures adopted to terminate poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic in the first half of the year has been kept under control. However, the infection source in the triangular area around Taihu Lake still remains. The H7N9 epidemic will probably hit the area later in the year and next spring when the migratory birds return and may even spread to other areas. Great importance should therefore be attached to the wildfowl in Taihu Lake as the repository and disseminator of the virus: investigation and study of this population is essential.																			1863-1959	1863-2378				FEB	2015	62	1					29	37		10.1111/zph.12110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.12110								24628953					WOS:000347956900005

Results are presented as deposition fluxes of NO3-, SO42-, PO43-, Cl-, F-, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+ and H+, and compared with other locations in California and elsewhere. Deposition fluxes of anions and cations to the pine branches were low, several times lower than the values determined near the Emerald Lake Watershed (ELW), another sub-alpine location in the western Sierra Nevada. The sums of deposition fluxes of the measured cations and anions to pine surfaces were similar, in contrast to the ELW location where the sums of cation fluxes were much higher than the sums of anion fluxes. A strong positive correlation between depositions of NO3- and NH4+, as well as SO42- and Ca2+, suggested that large portions of these ions might have originated from particulate NH4NO3 and CaSO4 deposited on pine surfaces. An estimated total N dry deposition (surface deposition of NO3- and NH4+ and internal uptake of NO2 and HNO3) to the forested area of the EBLW was 29.54 eq ha-1 yr-1 (about 414 g N ha-1 yr-1).

J	Kloiber, SN; Brezonik, PL; Olmanson, LG; Bauer, ME				Kloiber, SN; Brezonik, PL; Olmanson, LG; Bauer, ME			A procedure for regional lake water clarity assessment using Landsat multispectral data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Although previous investigations have demonstrated reliable empirical relationships between satellite data and nearly contemporaneous ground observations, satellite imagery has not been incorporated into routine lake monitoring programs, This paper focuses on key issues involved in applying satellite imagery to the regional assessment of lake clarity. Ten Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and four Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) spanning 25 years (1973-1998) were analyzed. Based on this analysis, recommendations are made for a Landsat-based procedure for water clarity assessment. Closeness of fit(r(2) values) of regression models between satellite brightness data and measured Secchi disk transparency (SDT) decreased with increasing size of the time window between image collection and ground observation of SDT. Use of SDT data collected within +/-1 day of the image date is recommended. but where SDT data are limited. windows up to 7 days yield reasonable results, especially in late summer when water clarity is relatively constant. Average brightness data from at least nine pixels in the deep open area of a take should be used to predict take clarity. but the accuracy of predicted SDT did not improve much as the number of pixels in the area of interest (AOI) increased above this value, A three-coefficient regression model using the TM1/TM3 ratio and TM1 was a consistent and reliable predictor of SDT (r(2) values of .7-.8). A similar relationship involving the MSS1/MSS2 ratio and MSS1 was a reasonable predictor of SDT for MSS data. Efforts to produce a standard prediction equation for SDT applicable to images collected on different dates were not successful, but a simple regression procedure to account for differences in atmospheric conditions among image collection dates substantially decreased the range of coefficients in the regression model.

The effects of infiltration-based stormwater best management practices on the hydrology and phosphorus budget of a eutrophic urban lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Small GE, Niederluecke EQ, Shrestha P, Janke BD, Finlay JC. The effects of infiltration-based stormwater best management practices on the hydrology and phosphorus budget of a eutrophic urban lake. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:38-50. Urban lakes can provide a variety of ecosystem services but managing water quality in urban environments is a challenge due to greatly altered hydrology and nutrient cycling. Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce inputs of total phosphorus (TP) to urban lakes through interception and infiltration of stormwater runoff. However, the indirect effects of stormwater infiltration on urban lake water quality are not well understood. We used a heuristic hydrology and phosphorus model of an urban lake to explore how changes in hydraulic flushing due to stormwater management can affect water quality. We applied the model to Como Lake, a 28 ha shallow lake in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA, which is impaired due to excess TP. The model was calibrated using 17 yr of data, including 10 yr post-BMP implementation. We then used the model to estimate the effect of a range of simulated BMP implementations on the lake's hydrology and P budget. BMP implementation reduced external TP loads to the lake, but reductions in water-column TP concentrations were partially undermined by reduced flushing in the summer months, when water column concentrations were highest, leading to reduced downstream TP export and the increased relative importance of evaporation. While the benefits of BMPs can often extend beyond lake P management, these results suggest that simply quantifying reductions in TP loading due to BMPs while ignoring altered hydrology could lead to overestimating water quality benefits.

J	Boutilier, RG; Donohoe, PH; Tattersall, GJ; West, TG				Boutilier, RG; Donohoe, PH; Tattersall, GJ; West, TG			Hypometabolic homeostasis in overwintering aquatic amphibians	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Many amphibians encounter conditions each winter when their body temperature is so low that normal activities are suspended and the animals enter into a state of torpor. In ice-covered ponds or lakes, oxygen levels may also become limiting, thereby forcing animals to endure prolonged periods of severe hypoxia or anoxia. Certain frogs (e.g. Rana temporaria) can dramatically suppress their metabolism in anoxia but are not as tolerant as other facultative vertebrate anaerobes (e.g. turtle, goldfish) of prolonged periods of complete O-2 lack, Many overwintering amphibians do, however, tolerate prolonged bouts of severe hypoxia, relying exclusively on cutaneous gas exchange, Rana temporaria overwintering for 2 months in hypoxic water (P-O2 approximately 25 mmHg) at 3 degrees C progressively reduce their blood P-CO2 to levels characteristic of water-breathing fish, The result is that blood pH rises and presumably facilitates transcutaneous O-2 transfer by increasing Hb O-2-affinity. Even after months of severe hypoxia, there is no substantial build-up of lactate as the animals continue to rely on cutaneous gas exchange to satisfy the requirements of a suppressed aerobic metabolism, Our recent experiments have shown that the skeletal muscle of frogs oxyconforms in vitro to the amount of O-2 available, The cellular basis for the oxyconformation of skeletal muscle is unknown, but the hypothesis driving our continuing experiments theorises that metabolic suppression at a cellular level is synonymous with suppressed ion leak across cellular membranes.					; Tattersall, Glenn/D-3469-2009	, Paul Donohoe/0009-0001-5376-7518; Tattersall, Glenn/0000-0002-6591-6760													0022-0949	1477-9145				JAN	1997	200	2					387	400											9050248					WOS:A1997WH71900022

A total of 13 lakes were studied to quantify the influence of climate and vegetation on the reconstructed Holocene C accumulation rate (CAR) in lake sediments of the modern East Asian monsoonal margin. The corresponding paleoclimate information was assessed, including the temperature (30-90 degrees N in the Northern Hemisphere) and precipitation (indicated by the delta O-18 of the Sanbao, Dongge, and Hulu caves). The Holocene vegetation conditions were inferred by pollen records, including arboreal pollen/non-arboreal pollen and pollen percentages. The results showed that the peak CAR occurred during the mid-Holocene, coinciding with the strongest period of the East Asian summer monsoon and expansion of forests. Lakes in the temperate steppe (TS) regions had a mean CAR of 13.41 +/- 0.88 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which was significantly greater than the CARs of temperate desert (TD) and highland meadow/steppe (HMS; 6.76 +/- 0.29 and 7.39 +/- 0.73 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The major influencing factor for the TS sub-region was vegetation dynamics, especially the proportion of arboreal vegetation, while temperature and vegetation coverage were more important for the HMS. These findings indicate that C accumulation in lake sediments is linked with climate and vegetation changes over long timescales; however, there was notable spatial heterogeneity in the CARs, such as opposing temporal changes and different major influencing factors among the three sub-regions during the mid-Holocene. Aridification and forest loss would decrease C storage. However, prediction of C accumulation remains difficult because of the spatial heterogeneity in CARs and the interaction between the CAR and various factors under future climate change conditions.

Fish were collected during the summer of 2000 along a 20-mile stretch of the lower Willamette River. Concentrations of SigmaPCBs (sum of 25 individually determined PCB congeners) and SigmaDDTs (sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDD) in fish ranged from 14 to 530 and from 18 to 510 ng/g-wet weight, respectively. SigmaPCBs concentrations at all sites exceeded US EPA fish advisory's screening values. Hexachlorobiphenyl congener 153 was the most abundant of the PCBs detected and p,p'-DDE was the most abundant OC pesticide detected. Low levels of dieldrin were detected in fish at all sites with the highest concentration at the superfund site (4.6 ng/g-wet weight), while other OC pesticides tested were near or below detection limits (approximate to2 ng/g). In general, organic chemical contaminant concentrations were highest in fish from the superfund site and were lower further upriver. Smallmouth bass had the highest levels of OC compounds of three fish species examined. They also had the largest site-to-site variations whereas black crappie had little variation throughout the study area. Mercury levels in fish ranged from 13 to 520 ng/g.

J	Ma, D; Xia, HL				Ma, Da; Xia, Huali			ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF WATER POLLUTION ON TOURISM ACTIVITIES IN SCENIC SPOTS UNDER THE CONCEPT OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												With the continuous development of social economy and industry, more and more attention has been paid to the concept of ecological and environmental protection in scenic spots. Water quality has a great influence on tourism activities in lake scenic spots. In order to study the impact of water pollution on tourism activities in scenic spots, in this paper, single factor pollution index method and Nemeiro index method are used to evaluate the water quality of lake scenic spots. In addition, the water pollution levels of the two methods are compared. Through the water quality evaluation methods, the water quality of a lake from 2000 to 2019 was analyzed. Five pollution factors including potassium permanganate index, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen were selected as evaluation factors. Through analysis, it is concluded that the comprehensive index of lake water pollution first increased and then decreased. In 2005, the comprehensive index of water quality pollution reached the maximum value of 4.56, and after 2015, the comprehensive index of water pollution fell below 1. The water quality evaluation grade has also been reduced from Grade IV in 2005 to Grade I in 2015, thus the water quality has improved significantly. The number of tourists and total tourism revenue in this lake scenic spot in the past 20 years has shown a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. The number of tourists and total tourism revenue dropped to the lowest point of 5.28 million, 9.8 billion yuan in 2005, and gradually increased to 70 million, 73.2 billion yuan in 2019. Through comparative analysis, it is found that water pollution has greatly affected tourism activities. The improvement of lake water quality is positively correlated with the number of tourists and total tourism revenue.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2021	30	8					9966	9971																WOS:000682519600039

In deep lakes, stratification enhancement and mixing reduction have already been observed, leading to hypolimnetic anoxia and to the rise of cyanophytes. The increase in stability depends on the rise of air temperature due to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Primary production could then either increase with rising epilimnetic temperature and buoyancy or decrease as fewer nutrients are upwelled from deep layers. The prevailing outcome, as well as the quantitative and temporal dynamics of all climate-induced modifications, depend on the specific lake characteristics. Individual analyses are then needed, one-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-ecological numerical models being suitable tools for such predictions. Here, we simulated with GLM-AED2 (General Lake Model - Aquatic EcoDynamics) the 2020-2085 dynamics of the oligomictic and oligotrophic deep subalpine Lake Maggiore (Italy/Switzerland), according to the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario with random meteorological series obtained from the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG), highlighting the uncertainties related to meteorology. Increase and decrease of nutrient loads were also tested. Results show that anoxia would occur in the hypolimnion regardless of nutrient input reduction, unless global GHG emissions were immediately reduced. Total phytoplankton biomass would be weakly affected by climate change, strongly depending on nutrient input, yet water warming would cause cyanophytes to compete with diatoms. Therefore, the fate of Lake Maggiore would be tied to both global and local environmental policies.

Landslides, Alluvial Fans, and Dam Failure at Red Rock Pass: The Outlet of Lake Bonneville	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											The outlet area of Lake Bonneville has had over a century and a quarter of science and speculation about its configuration and character and many disparate interpretations have appeared in the literature. In this chapter, we offer our interpretations of the outlet, which are based on field research begun in the 1980s and review of the pertinent literature. The Marsh Creek alluvial fan near Red Rock Pass, which formed the natural dam for Lake Bonneville, was built westward from the Portneuf Range to where it abutted a large landslide complex on the eastern slope of the Bannock Range. At the low point on the crest of the alluvial fan the Zenda threshold of Lake Bonneville determined the elevation of the Bonneville shoreline and was washed out by the Bonneville flood. The landslide includes deformed Neogene lacustrine sediments (the Salt Lake Formation) and blocks of Paleozoic bedrock. Landforms characteristic of large-scale mass movements on the Red Rock Pass landslide complex include hummocky topography and multiple scarps at the heads of smaller slumps. The older part of the landslide mass was emplaced long before Lake Bonneville in response to increasing tectonic relief during the Neogene and Quaternary. It sits higher on the eastern slope of the Bannock Range adjacent to a younger part of the landslide mass, which moved in response to catastrophic dewatering and erosional removal of lateral support by the Bonneville flood. Valleys with bowl-shaped heads and U-shaped cross-valley profiles on the north-sloping surface of the Marsh Creek alluvial fan, were formed by groundwater flow from Lake Bonneville late in its transgressive phase through the fan and other surficial deposits. Headward erosion of the valleys by spring sapping led to the Bonneville flood, a dam failure involving processes typical of failures of man-made and natural dams throughout the world.

CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN												OBJECTIVE To determine whether there were discrepancies between what medications frail elderly outpatients took and what physicians thought they took and whether discrepancies put patients at risk of taking inappropriate drugs and of increasing the potential for drug interactions. DESIGN Case series. SETTING Day Hospital Program at St Mary's of the Lake Hospital in Kingston, Ont. PARTICIPANTS One hundred twenty community-living elderly patients attending the Day Hospital Program in 1998. Three patients and two family physicians declined to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Lists of medications being taken by patients compared with lists of medications in physicians' charts. Category according to explicit criteria that each drug fell into and risk of drug interactions as determined by the Clinidata Drug Interaction Program. RESULTS Of the 120 patients, 115 had at least one discrepancy between their lists of medications and their physicians' lists. Of the 1390 medications on the lists, 521 (37%) were being taken by patients without their doctors' knowledge, 82 (6%) were not being taken by patients when doctors thought they were, and 133 (10%) were on both patients' and their doctors' lists but with dosages or frequency of administration that were different. More potential drug interactions were identified on patients' lists than on physicians' lists. No increase in risk of inappropriate drug use was identified. CONCLUSION Family physicians are often unaware of all the medications their patients are actually taking. Medications used by patients without physicians' knowledge increase the likelihood of drug interactions. Family physicians should look at and inquire about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, their patients are actually taking.																			0008-350X					JUN	2001	47						1198	1204											11421047					WOS:000169309900012

The occurrence of V. diluvianus covers the Taxus zone, the so-called intra-interglacial cooling period (Pinus-Larix zone), the climatic optimum (Carpinus-Abies zone) and the post-optimal period with an undefined pollen zone. The isotope record of V. diluvianus shells allowed palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. delta O-18 and delta C-13 vary from -8.7 parts per thousand in the post-optimal period to -4.8 parts per thousand in the optimal period, and from -10.6 parts per thousand at the beginning of the Taxus zone to -4.2 parts per thousand at the climatic optimum, respectively. A positive correlation of the isotope curves indicates closed-water bodies, and only at Roskosz was some occasional overflow inferred. Higher oxygen isotopes correspond to an increase in temperature and/or enhanced evaporation, which is well marked in the Carpinus-Abies zone, whereas samples enriched in C-13 are correlated with periods demonstrating a lower water level and higher productivity in the lakes. Episodes of lake shallowing and dense aquatic vegetation occurred in the Pinus-Larix zone and during the climatic optimum. The isotope ratios for the climatic optimum significantly exceed those of the other periods, thus pointing to warmer conditions. An estimation of relative changes of average summer temperatures using the delta O-18/temperature gradient yielded variation of 1-2 degrees C within the lakes. Absolute temperature reconstructions indicate the effects of specific local conditions. Hence, V. diluvianus shells offer a reliable proxy in qualitative studies of interglacial lake records.

Interdisciplinary investigations of the first reported laminated lacustrine sediments in Romania	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												An interdisciplinary study (cartographic and historical records, geomorphological, geological and bathymetric survey, water analysis, sediment coring and analysis and AMS radiocarbon dating) of two small and previously unreported lakes (Iezer and Bolatau) in Obcina Feredeului Mountains, northeastern Romania, provides new data into the environmental history and possible human impacts over the last millennium in this region. The first recorded historical reference to Iezer Lake dates to 1594 AD, and to Bolatau Lake to 1806 AD. Two sediment cores (420 cm for Iezer and 540 cm for Bolatau) of finely banded lake sediments and a radiocarbon age estimate at Iezer Lake suggest that this lake may represent the oldest landslide lake in Romania. The geomorphological, geological, and morphometric surveys indicate that these lakes' origins relate to landslide activity. Coarse grained, lighter sediment bands are generally characterized by higher values in magnetic susceptibility, Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetisation (SIRM), as well in geochemical indicators such as Ti and Zr, and low organic content, possibly indicating periods of increased runoff. Conversely, finer-grained, dark sediment bands show lower values in magnetic susceptibility, SIRM, Ti and Zr and higher organic content, and are likely to suggest quieter deposition periods. However, there are two significant episodes of markedly increased surface erosion. The oldest occurs between 100 and 110 cm, and might be coincident with the terminal part of Little Ice Age (LIA), whereas the youngest in the top 30 cm coincides with recent land use. These lakes hold significant potential in providing an important perspective on the environmental conditions over the last millennium and, more specifically, to supply new information about the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and LIA signals in the NE Romanian Carpathians. These two landslide-dammed lakes should be defined as scientific reserves to ensure their protection and to enhance their use as a scientific and educational resource.

J	Reinert, RA; Eason, G				Reinert, RA; Eason, G			Genetic control of O3 sensitivity in a cross between two cultivars of snap bean	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE												Identification of genetic control of ozone (O-3) sensitivity is desirable for selection of plant cultivars which are indicators of O-3 stress. A cross was made between two cultivars of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L),'Oregon 91' (P-1) and 'Wade Bush' (P-2), an O-3-sensitive and O-3-insensitive cultivar, respectively. Ten genetic populations (generations), 'Oregon 91' (P-1),'Wade Bush' (P-2), F-1, F-2, backcrosses to both parents, and all reciprocal crosses, were field planted in each of two summers and evaluated for injury to O-3. Ozone responses for the reciprocal crosses were not significantly different for any generation, so injury ratings from the reciprocal crosses were combined for each generation to provide six populations (P-1, P-2, F-1, F-2, BC1, and BC2) for analysis. When components of genetic variation were estimated from the six generations, additive genetic variance was the most important component in the total genetic variance available, although dominance variance was also a significant component. There was an inconsistency in the magnitude and the direction of the factors contributing to the dominance effects and also a large environmental component making up the phenotypic variance. Estimates of broad-sense heritability and narrow-sense heritability were 60% and 44%, respectively. Results suggest that O-3-sensitive and O-3-insensitive selections could be screened and evaluated in an ambient O-3 environment. Several generations will be necessary, however, to develop 'Bush Blue Lake' type selections that vary only in sensitivity to O-3.																			0003-1062					MAR	2000	125	2					222	227		10.21273/JASHS.125.2.222	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.125.2.222													WOS:000088153400013

Hypolimnetic oxygenation 1: win-win solution for massive salmonid mortalities in a reservoir tailwater hatchery on the Mokelumne River, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Horne AJ. 2019. Hypolimnetic oxygenation 1: win-win solution for massive salmonid mortalities in a reservoir tailwater hatchery on the Mokelumne River, California. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. More than 300,000 hatchery fish supplied with deep hypolimnetic water from Camanche Reservoir, California died during two short, late summer events during the 1987-1992 drought. A criminal complaint cited the water agency for negligence. Fisheries agencies blamed the fish kills on low water levels but retaining more water would cut supplies to 1.4 million city residents, downstream farmers, and wild river fish. The reservoir was assumed to be unproductive due to its undeveloped mountain watershed but no measurements had been made. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was suspected as the toxic agent since it acts rapidly. Later examination of sediment redox indicated the potential for H2S formation which was confirmed by odor. A cure for H2S in the hatchery and river below the dam was a Hypolimnetic Oxygenation System (HOS). In addition, a management system was devised to guarantee a minimum volume of cool (<16.4 C), oxygenated, hypolimnetic water. The two management strategies (HOS and cool pool) greatly improved conditions. H2S was eliminated, fish moved into deep water in the reservoir, and no fish kills have occurred in 24 yr. The HOS was superior to permanganate treatments or maintaining high reservoir water levels during droughts. The criminal lawsuit was settled, no one went to jail, and inter-agency cooperation improved. Following HOS operation, Chinook salmon returns rose significantly (p < 0.05) from 3550/yr to 7660/yr (2009) and 19,867/yr (2018), with 10,000/yr spawning naturally in the river. Returns during a recent drought increased tenfold. Endangered steelhead trout returns rose from 8/yr to 1,168/yr (2017).																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2019	35	3			SI		308	322		10.1080/10402381.2019.1649770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1649770		AUG 2019											WOS:000483475900001

Adequate biomass was acquired in single, 2-h collections to permit triplicate gas chromatographic analyses of 1-4 g samples for 36 organochlorine contaminants. Contaminant levels varied unpredictably but relatively little among samples taken at monthly intervals over the summer. Samples collected simultaneously from the two sides of the Detroit R. reflected local sediment contaminant patterns, suggesting limited dispersal by adults. Genus-specific differences in contaminant concentrations within the Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae probably reflect differences in larval habitats and manner of feeding. Contaminant concentrations and relative composition paralleled published reports of contaminants in sediments from collection locations. St. Marys R. caddisflies contained contaminant levels indistinguishable from samples collected at reference sites. St. Clair R. samples contained high levels of compounds associated with petrochemical industries located in the river's upstream reaches. High levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and most other contaminants in Detroit R. samples reflected industrial loadings near Detroit, Michigan. Niagara R. samples contained elevated concentrations of PCBs and pesticides. Cluster analysis grouped samples into five clusters each with unique contaminant composition. These also corresponded to geographic origin: St. Marys, St. Clair, Detroit and upper and lower Niagara rivers. The relative ease of collection and consistent results obtained render adult Trichoptera potentially valuable candidates for surveys of aquatic contamination over a broad range of geographical and ecological conditions.

Brackish and relatively unstable conditions were inferred for the earlier part of the late glacial between 18.9 and 13.4 cal ka BP and for the early to mid Holocene (11.9-6.8 cal ka BP). A saline lake existed in the intervening period probably representing colder and drier conditions during the Greenland Stadial 1 (=Younger Dryas in North Atlantic region). Freshwater conditions similar to the present stage of Lake Donggi Cona were established for the first time at 6.8 cal ka BP. This inference and the implied increase in moisture availability in the latter half of the Holocene is in contrast to most climate records from the Tibetan Plateau which suggest drier and colder conditions. However, three lake records from the eastern Tibetan Plateau including our new record show that the Holocene insolation-driven monsoonal weakening and temperature decrease caused a catchment-specific, opposite response of the moisture availability in comparison to those at the majority of sites. Catchments with relatively low precipitation at present experienced apparently a moisture availability increase during the colder second half of the Holocene in contrast to the inferred drier conditions at predominantly generally wetter sites. The increase in moisture availability at relatively dry sites mainly results from the lowered temperature and evaporation but is probably further controlled by a complex of factors including the amount and timing of precipitation, the altitudes of the lake basins and upper reaches, and the existence or development of glaciers, snow fields and frozen ground in a given catchment. Our record from Lake Donggi Cona suggests that the recently observed reduction in Yellow River discharge in response to present global warming will likely continue or even increase under warmer climatic conditions in the future.

Satellite, airborne, and shipborne gravity techniques are options, but the resolution and/or cost of these systems make them impractical or inaccurate for exploration or environmental studies, where the required resolution is < 0.1 mGal/km. In this study, the feasibility of a around gravity survey over a frozen lake where ice moves because of windy conditions is assessed. Lake Wanapitei, widely accepted as resulting from the impact of a meteorite 37 million years ago, is one of these cases in which the necessity of expanding coverage over poorly sampled regions arose from a significant gap between surface and airborne geophysical maps. Two gravity surveys were completed on the ice of Lake Wanapitei in the winters of 2003 and 2004. To study the structure, longtime series of gravity field measurements were recorded for 98 stations. allowing for improved control over the noise sources in the data. Final processing and integration with an existing regional data set in the area and the application of terrain corrections reduced the amplitude of the circular anomaly from 15 to 9 mGal and its diameter from I I to 6 km. The feasibility of gravity surveys on ice was assessed, and we determined that for large-scale studies such as this one. the quality of the data, even under noisy conditions, was acceptable. However, for more detailed mapping, calm wind conditions and long time series are required.																			0016-8033	1942-2156				MAY-JUN	2006	71	3					J23	J29		10.1190/1.2189387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.2189387													WOS:000238819700029

A Climatology of Easterly Wind Lake-Effect and Lake-Enhanced Precipitation Events over the Western Lake Superior Region	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Lake-effect precipitation is convective precipitation produced by relatively cold air passing over large and relatively warm bodies of water. This phenomenon most often occurs in North America over the southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes, where high annual snowfalls and high-impact snowstorms frequently occur under prevailing west and northwest flow. Locally higher snow or rainfall amounts also occur as a result of lake-enhanced synoptic precipitation when conditionally unstable or neutrally stratified air is present in the lower troposphere. Although likely less common, lake-effect and lake-enhanced precipitation can also occur with easterly winds, impacting the western shores of the Great Lakes. This study describes a 15-yr climatology of easterly lake-effect (ELEfP) and lake-enhanced (ELEnP) precipitation [conjointly, easterly lake collective precipitation (ELCP)] events that developed in east-to-east-northeasterly flow over western Lake Superior from 2003 to 2018. ELCP occurs infrequently but often enough to have a notable climatological impact over western Lake Superior, with an average of 14.6 events per year. The morphology favors both single shore-parallel ELEfP bands due to the convex western shoreline of Lake Superior and mixed-type banding due to ELEnP events occurring in association with "overrunning" synoptic-scale precipitation. ELEfP often occurs in association with a surface anticyclone to the north of Lake Superior. ELEnP typically features a similar northerly displaced anticyclone and a surface cyclone located over the upper Midwest that favor easterly boundary layer winds over western Lake Superior.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				APR	2023	62	4					529	545		10.1175/JAMC-D-22-0080.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-22-0080.1													WOS:000985984100001
J	Markle, DF; Clauson, K				Markle, Douglas F.; Clauson, Kale			Ontogenetic and habitat-related changes in diet of late larval and juvenile suckers (Catostomidae) in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												We describe ontogenetic patterns in the diets of shortnose and Lost River suckers (15.8-92.8 mm standard length) front Upper Klamath Lake in summer 1999. Both species made a transition from surface and planktonic prey to benthic prey at about 20-30 mm standard length, corresponding to the approximate size of the juvenile morphological transition. Surface prey was dominated by adult chironomids and undigestable pollen, while benthic prey was dominated by larval chironomids, chydorids, and ostracods. In the 15-20-mm size class, pollen made tip > 75% of food particles in 68% of specimens, and only 2 specimens in this size class lacked any pollen grains. A better understanding of the prey selection process in larval stickers is needed to determine the importance of this potential source of starvation. The planktonic prey eaten during the surface-to-benthic feeding transition were widely distributed in the lake, suggesting that larvae use emergent vegetation primarily as a refuge front predators. On a numerical basis, crustaceans and larval chironomids contributed most to the diets of larger juveniles. In specimens > 40 mm, shortnose suckers ate more Tanytarsini and Lost River stickers ate more chironomid pupae and chydorids. In specimens > 40 turn there was a strong habitat-related difference in diet: specimens collected in offshore samples ate more chironomid larvae and pupae, harpacticoid copepods, and chydorids, whereas onshore specimens ate more cyclopoid copepods and invertebrate eggs. The transition from onshore to offshore habitat appears to occur over a broad size range of about 40-90 mm.

J	Åberg, J; Wallin, MB				Aberg, Jan; Wallin, Marcus B.			Evaluating a fast headspace method for measuring DIC and subsequent calculation of pCO2 in freshwater systems	INLAND WATERS												A variety of different sampling and analysis methods are found in the literature for determining carbon dioxide (CO2) in freshwaters, methods that rarely have been evaluated or compared. Here we present an evaluation of an acidified headspace method (AHS) in which the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is measured from an acidified sample and the partial pressure (pCO(2)) is calculated from DIC using pH and water temperature. We include information on practical sampling, accuracy, and precision of the DIC/pCO(2) determination and a storage test of samples. The pCO(2) determined from the AHS method is compared to that obtained from the more widely used direct headspace method (DHS) in which CO2 is equilibrated between the water and gas phases at ambient pH. The method was tested under both controlled laboratory conditions as well as wintertime field sampling. The accuracy of the DIC detection was on average 99% based on prepared standard solutions. The pCO(2) determination in lab, using the DHS method as a reference, showed no significant difference, although the discrepancy between the methods was larger in samples with <1000 mu atm. The precision of the pCO(2) determination was on average +/- 4.3%, which was slightly better than the DHS method (+/- 6.7%). In the field, the AHS method determined on average 10% higher pCO(2) than the DHS method, which was explained by the extreme winter conditions (below -20 degrees C) at sampling that affected the sampling procedure of the DHS method. Although samples were acidified to pH 2, respiration processes were still occurring (at a low rate), and we recommend that analyses are conducted within 3 days from sampling. The AHS method was found to be a robust method to determine DIC and pCO(2) in acidic to pH-neutral freshwater systems. The simple and quick sampling procedure makes the method suitable for time-limited sampling campaigns and sampling in cold climate.

Hysteretic freezing characteristics of riparian peatlands in the Western Boreal Forest of Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Freezing characteristics were investigated for a sedge covered floating fen and spruce covered swamp located beside a shallow lake in the Western Boreal Forest of Canada. Thermal properties were measured in situ for one freeze-thaw cycle, and for two freeze-thaw cycles in laboratory columns. Thermal conductivity and liquid water content were related to a range of subsurface temperatures above and below the freezing thresholds, and clearly illustrate hysteresis between the freezing and thawing process. Thermal hysteresis occurs because of the large change in thermal conductivity between water and ice, high water content of the peat, and wide variation in pore sizes that govern ice formation. Field and laboratory results were combined to develop linear freezing functions, which were tested in a heat transfer model. For surface temperature boundary conditions, subsurface temperatures were simulated for the over-winter period and compared with field measurements. Replication of the transient subsurface thermal regime required that freezing functions transition gradually from thawed to frozen state (spanning the -0.25 to -2 degrees C range) as opposed to a more abrupt step function. Subsurface temperatures indicate that the floating fen underwent complete phase change (from water to ice) and froze to approximately the same depth as lake ice thickness. Therefore, the floating fen peatland froze as a 'shelf' adjacent to the lake, whereas the spruce covered swamp had a higher capacity for thermal buffering, and subsurface freezing was both more gradual and limited in depth. These thermal properties, and the timing and duration of frozen state, are expected to control the interaction of water and nutrients between surface water and groundwater, which will be affected by changes in air temperature associated with global climate change.

Toward bridging this knowledge gap, we measured a full complement of optical properties in western Lake Erie during cyanobacteria blooms in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Our measurements focus attention on the optical uniqueness of cyanobacteria blooms, which have consequences for remote sensing and bio-optical modeling. We found the cyanobacteria blooms in the western basin during our field work were dominated by Microcystis, while the waters in the adjacent central basin were dominated by Planktothrix. Chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 1 to over 135 mu g/L across the study area with the highest concentrations associated with Microcystis in the western basin. We observed large, amorphous colonial Microcystis structures in the bloom area characterized by high phytoplankton absorption and high scattering coefficients with a mean particle backscatter ratio at 443 nm 0.03, which is higher than other plankton types and more comparable to suspended inorganic sediments. While our samples contained mixtures of both, our analysis suggests high contributions to the measured scatter and backscatter coefficients from cyanobacteria. Our measurements provide new insights into the optical properties of cyanobacteria blooms, and indicate that current semi-analytic models are likely to have problems resolving a closed solution in these types of waters as many of our observations are beyond the range of existing model components. We believe that different algorithm or model approaches are needed for these conditions, specifically for phytoplankton absorption and particle backscatter components. From a remote sensing perspective, this presents a challenge not only in terms of a need for new algorithms, but also for determining when to apply the best algorithm for a given situation. These results are new in the sense that they represent a complete description of the optical properties of freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, and are likely to be representative of bloom conditions for other systems containing Microcystis cells and colonies.					; Nayak, Aditya/AAJ-4895-2020; Mouw, Colleen/M-4431-2015	Nayak, Aditya/0000-0002-2936-5607; McFarland, Malcolm/0000-0001-7776-6053; 														2296-7745					2017	4								300	10.3389/fmars.2017.00300	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00300													WOS:000457690600298

Russian nesting dolls effect - Using wavelet analysis to reveal non-stationary and nested stationary signals in water yield from catchments on a northern forested landscape	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Determining catchment responses to climate signals gives insight into the potential effects of climate change. This study tested the hypothesis that a 28-year time series of water yields from four headwater catchments in the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW), Ontario contains signals of non-stationary climate change and naturally occurring stationary climate oscillations and that the effects of these signals are greater in catchments with lower rates of change in water loading and lower water storage capacity (small wetlands). Non-stationary trends explained 0%, 18%, 44%, and 52% of the variance in the water yields of the four catchments. Wavelet analysis using Morlet wavelets identified stationary responses at multiple temporal scales, increasing the amount of variance explained to 56%, 63%, 76%, and 81% when combining stationary and non-stationary models. The catchment with low water loading and low water storage was most sensitive to non-stationary and stationary signals, suggesting that these catchments act as sentinels to detect climatic signals. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed correlations between global climate oscillation indices and water yield. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index was strongly correlated with both temperature and precipitation (R2=0.46, P<0.001 and R2 of 0.34, P<0.001, respectively). Temperature in the TLW increased by 0.067 degrees C per year from 1981 to 2008, but approximately 0.037 degrees C of this increase can be explained by the AMO index. While it is likely that anthropogenic climate change impacts water yields, it is important to account for multiple nested climate oscillations to avoid exaggerating its effects.

The mean CO2 flux calculated by sequential Gaussian simulation from the lake was 1,190 (March 2007), 730 (December 2007) and 1,134 g m(-2) day(-1) (April 2008) with total emission rates of 164 +/- 9.5 (March 2007), 59 +/- 2.5 (December 2007) and 109 +/- 6.6 t day(-1) (April 2008). The mean CO2 flux estimated from the entire crater floor area was 1,102 g m(-2) day(-1) for April 2008 with a total emission rate of 144 +/- 5.9 t day(-1). Significant change in CO2 flux was not detected during the period of survey, and the mapping of the CO2 flux highlighted lineaments reflecting the main local and regional tectonic patterns. The He-3/He-4 ratio (as high as 8.1 R (A)) for gases in the El Chichn crater is generally higher than those observed at the neighbouring Transmexican Volcanic Belt and the Central American Volcanic Arc. The CO2/He-3 ratios for the high He-3/He-4 gases tend to have the MORB-like values (1.41 Au 10(9)), and the CO2/He-3 ratios for the lower He-3/He-4 gases fall within the range for the arc-type gases. The high He-3/He-4 ratios, the MORB-like CO2/He-3 ratios for the high He-3/He-4 gases and high proportion of MORB-CO2 (M = 25 +/- 15%) at El Chichn indicate a greater depth for the generation of magma when compared to typical arc volcanoes.

J	Caseldine, C; Langdon, P; Holmes, N				Caseldine, Chris; Langdon, Peter; Holmes, Naomi			Early Holocene climate variability and the timing and extent of the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) in northern Iceland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The magnitude and timing of Holocene maximum warmth in the Arctic and sub-Arctic has been the subject of considerable recent interest, particularly in the context of future climate change. Although lying at a crucial location in the North Atlantic close to significant atmospheric and oceanic boundaries, terrestrial Holocene climatic data from Iceland are few and predominantly derive from glacial and palaeoecological evidence. Here we present new datasets from Trollaskagi, based on chironomid-inferred temperatures (CI-T), using subfossil chironomids from the same lake sediments supplemented by pollen data. July air temperatures have been derived using an Icelandic training set, and the data suggest optimal temperatures at sea level up to 1.5 degrees C above current levels around 8 kcal. yr BP, a time when birch woodland was well developed in Trollaskagi, but when woodland had still not fully developed in the more isolated NW peninsula. Our data thus suggest that optimal summer warmth did not occur in Iceland until 8 kcal. yr BP at the earliest, possibly lasting until 6.7 kcal. yr BP. The amount of warming for July was therefore at least 1.5 degrees C, but possibly up to 2-3 degrees C higher than the 1961-1990 average on the basis of the tree-line data. Comparison with data from elsewhere in adjacent Arctic regions, Greenland and Eastern Arctic Canada show peak warmth to be later in Iceland, and less pronounced. It also appears that there were enhanced temperature gradients during the first half of the Holocene between the two study areas Trollaskagi and the NW Peninsula and that they influenced patterns of vegetation colonisation, with current spatial temperature patterns only developing as Holocene climate deteriorated after around 6 kcal. yr BP.

The dynamics of such lakes, in terms of their overall biological structure and productivity, depend on flooding and hushing during high-stage events. Major flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta-one of the world's largest and most productive deltas-has not occurred since 1974. Before this, the delta also experienced an extensive drying period from 1968 to 1971 as one of its main rivers became regulated. As a result, extensive changes have occurred in the vegetation regime and associated wildlife habitat. Two methods used in attempts to restore water to these systems are reviewed: rockfill weirs and artificial ice jams/dams. Recorded data since 1976 suggest that the weirs have been effective in restoring water on the large delta lakes to levels which would have occurred under an unregulated river regime. The weirs have not, however, replenished water in most of the perched basins. Moreover, even an historically high flow event in 1990 failed to flood them. Analysis of historical water level data revealed that ice-jam backwater is the only method by which these areas of the delta can be flooded. Although hydrometeorological conditions have not been conducive for the formation of major ice jams since 1974, attempts have been made to artificially induce an ice jam. The strategies, held trials and future applications of such an approach are reviewed.																			0886-9375					MAR-JUN	1996	12	2-3					237	250		10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3<237::AID-RRR392>3.3.CO;2-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3<237::AID-RRR392>3.3.CO;2-B													WOS:A1996UM71600010

Evaluating efficacy of a ballast water filtration system for reducing spread of aquatic species in freshwater ecosystems	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Biological invasions by non-indigenous species are considered a leading threat to biodiversity, with prevention being a key management strategy. Consequently, numerous commercial ballast water treatment systems have been, or are being, developed to prevent future aquatic invasions. However, most treatment systems are being designed for the many vessels undertaking long transoceanic voyages in marine waters rather than the relatively few vessels operating on short voyages in freshwater, such as those in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here we conduct testing of the biological efficacy of a 40 mu m ballast water filtration unit through shipboard trials. We test the hypotheses that i) filtration will significantly reduce abundance of zooplankton greater than 50 mu m in size but not phytoplankton 10 to 50 mu m in size; ii) filtration will reduce zooplankton abundances in ballast water below International Maritime Organization discharge standards, but not those of phytoplankton; and iii) filtration will alter the community composition of zooplankton, non-randomly reducing invasion risk of larger taxa. During the summer of 2012, three shipboard trials were conducted. Ballast water samples were collected using a before-after experimental design. Our study showed that filtration significantly reduced abundance of copepods and cladocerans, but not of juvenile dreissenid veligers and rotifers. Contrary to our expectation, phytoplankton densities were also significantly lower after the treatment. Overall, ballast water treated during our tests would not meet proposed international discharge standards. Filtration altered relative abundance of zooplankton, but did not reduce introduction risk of any taxonomic group due to the small juvenile stages and dormant eggs which passed through the treatment. While we do not rule out filtration as a ballast water treatment option for zooplankton in the future, our tests indicate further development is required for meaningful reduction of invasion risk.					; Bailey, Sarah/E-8356-2010	Adams, Jennifer/0000-0002-0380-3832; Briski, Elizabeta/0000-0003-1896-3860; Bailey, Sarah/0000-0003-3635-919X													1989-8649						2014	5	3			SI		245	253		10.3391/mbi.2014.5.3.08	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2014.5.3.08													WOS:000347935000008

The sites of Beit Aana, Al-Qutailbiya, Quorfase and Al-Waha Spring were characterized by high levels of leaching, whereas the highest concentrations of ammonium leaching were measured in December 2020 and March 2021, ranged between 5.74 and 5.81 mg/l. However, the lowest concentration 0.97 mg/l was recorded in February 2021 in the sites of Bestwair, Beit Al-Alouni, Geiboul and Al-Rahbeyia with lower levels of leaching. The highest concentrations of nitrate leaching were obtained during November 2020 and April 2021, ranged between 3.51 and 4.31 mg/l, while the lowest concentration of nitrate 0.59 mg/l was determined in January 2021. It was found that the levels of ammonium leaching decreased with depth, largely due to the adsorption of ammonium on the organic matter (OM) and clay minerals. The statistical study showed a correlation between ammonium leaching and the following variables: OM, saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC) and pH. Regression equations representing ammonium leaching in soil horizons and their role were also obtained.																				1751-231X				JUN	2023	18	6					1512	1528		10.2166/wpt.2023.083	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wpt.2023.083		MAY 2023											WOS:000993497800001

Recommendations for Stocking Gizzard Shad in a Large Upper Midwest Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, a pelagic detritivore found throughout the USA, are an important prey fish for many sport fish species and are often stocked in an attempt to bolster sport fish growth and condition. To date, there has been little research on how many or at what density prespawn adult Gizzard Shad should be stocked in order to produce a year-class suitable for sport fish consumption within that year. In Lake Oahe, South Dakota, Gizzard Shad are an important prey resource for Walleyes Sander vitreus and other sport fish when the number of Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax is low. However, severe winters in 2009-2011 extirpated the Gizzard Shad population in Lake Oahe (or reduced its abundance to below the detectable limit). Thus, Gizzard Shad were stocked in 2012 and 2013 to improve short-term prey fish production. During this time, we sought to identify how many or at what density prespawn adult Gizzard Shad need to be stocked in select embayments of Lake Oahe to achieve larval Gizzard Shad production similar to that in years when natural reproduction took place. Although the results were quite variable, we found positive linear relationships between the density of larval Gizzard Shad and the number and density of adult stockings, with the number of adults stocked providing a better indication of later larval production than adult stocking density. In general, stocking 150 prespawn adult Gizzard Shad would produce larval densities >= 5.0 fish/100 m(3) in select embayments of a large Midwest reservoir.

J	Korolev, A; Isaac, G				Korolev, A; Isaac, G			Roundness and aspect ratio of particles in ice clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The frequency of occurrence of the aspect ratio and roundness of particles in ice clouds from aircraft observations have been examined. Images of cloud particles were measured by a cloud particle imager (CPI) at 2.3-mum m resolution, installed on the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada Convair-580. Data were collected in winter midlatitude and polar stratiform clouds associated with frontal systems during three field projects in the Canadian and U. S. Arctic and over the Great Lakes. Approximately 10(6) images of particles measured in ice clouds were included in the statistics. The frequency of occurrence of the aspect ratio and roundness were calculated in eight 5degrees temperature intervals from -40degreesC to 0degreesC. In each temperature interval, the distributions were calculated for 12 size intervals in the range from 20 mum to 1 mum. It was found that the roundness is a function of particle size and within each size interval it does not depend significantly on temperature. However, the aspect ratio of particles with 60 mum < D < 1000 mum is mainly a function of temperature and does not depend on size. The fraction of spherical particles in ice clouds rapidly decreases with particle size. The fraction of spherical particles in the size range 20 mum, D-max, 30 mum on average does not exceed 50%. Ice clouds do not contain significant numbers of spherical particles larger than 60 mum. The information on the habits of small ice particles obtained here gives an insight on the mechanisms of ice formation in clouds. The results can be used for parameterization of particle habits in radiation transfer, weather and climate models, and in remote sensing retrievals. It may also be of interest for calculations of collision efficiency in modeling of interaction of cloud particles with moving platforms related to in-flight icing.																			0022-4928					AUG	2003	60	15					1795	1808		10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<1795:RAAROP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<1795:RAAROP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184346700004

Photophysical studies indicates emission intensity of L falls in long wavelength region. The L exhibits strong fluorometric "turnoff" response for Cu2+ ions with extreme selectivity and sensitivity in aqueous solutions and living cells. The Stern-volmer plot indicates the fluorescence quenching process is due to chelation-enhanced quenching (CHEQ) phenomena. Job's plot and ESI-MS studies suggest that L binds with Cu2+ ions in 2:1 (ligand:metal) ratio. The binding constant and limit of detection (LOD) value were determined to be 2.2 x 10(-4) M-1 and 2.3 x 10(-7)M respectively. pH study indicated L detect Cu2+ ions in a suitable biological range. The interference studied indicated that the sensing process was not affected by other metal ions. FT-IR analysis and DFT calculations clarified that Cu2+ ions bind with L through the N atom of azomethine (CH=N-) group and the O atom of phenolic-OH. Additionally, L was utilized to determine the Cu2+ ion concentration in tap water, lake water and river water. Finally, a sensing study of L in HeLa cells was conducted to test cell membrane permeability and its efficiency for selective Cu2+ ions detection in living cells.

Due to a combination of these two opposite factors, the central lake of Inga Park, which is an important urban park of the city, is suffering from water level reduction. This paper aims to verify if a sustainable drainage system design with infiltration wells can help recharge the surface aquifer. To this end, a stormwater drainage system simulation was conducted using SewerGEMS. Additionally, a calibrated shallow aquifer computational model was run in Visual Modflow Flex considering recharge wells to verify whether rainfall events impact the water levels of the surface aquifer. The results show that the sustainable intervention in a drainage system to increase stormwater infiltration has the potential to effectively recharge the shallow aquifers, while helping, at the same time, the drainage system, which is operating beyond design capacity, and the Inga Park Lake. Thus, this study demonstrates that the sustainable design of drainage systems can help restore the springs inside the urban park. However, it is important to continuously monitor the wells' heads and the hydrological variables. Also, for future studies, new models and simulations must be undertaken using the continuous monitoring data already available.

Chlorophyll a, magnesium (Mg), nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3), amount of organic matters, ammonia (NH3), phosphate (PO4), silica (Si) and calcium (Ca) were also analyzed monthly. All water quality parameters were within proper limits for mussel culture. At the end of the study, the greatest live weight (5.55 +/- 0.03 g) was obtained from 40 mussels/m(2), with 3.5 2 +/- 0.02 cm and 1.47 +/- 0.03 cm as length and width values, respectively. The greatest height was determined in a stocking rate of 60 mussels/m(2), with 1.99 +/- 0.03 cm. Therefore, juveniles should be stocked in early spring for U. tigridis at a level of 40-60 individuals/m(2).

J	Kristovich, DAR; Laird, NF				Kristovich, DAR; Laird, NF			Observations of widespread lake-effect cloudiness: Influences of lake surface temperature and upwind conditions	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Large spatial and temporal variations were observed in the location of the upwind cloud edge over Lake Michigan during five westerly wind lake-effect events in November 1995 through January 1996. This study examines the impacts of variations of Lake Michigan surface water temperatures (and corresponding surface fluxes) and upwind static stability on the location of the upwind edge of lake-effect clouds, which develop as cold air crosses the lake during the winter. Data used in this study were collected during the 1995/96 National Weather Service Lake-Effect Snow study. Spatial variations in the location of the upwind lake-effect cloud edge are shown to be related to spatial variations in surface heat and moisture fluxes between the lake surface and overlying air. Surface fluxes are influenced by both the distribution of lake surface water temperatures and variations of surface wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. Temporal variations of heat and moisture fluxes from the lake surface and low-level static stability upwind of the lake correlate well with changes in locations of the upwind lake-effect cloud edge. In general, increases in total flux over a particular period tended to correspond with westward change in the position of the upwind cloud edge, whereas decreases in total flux corresponded to eastward shifts of the upwind cloud edge. Atmospheric static stability below the upwind inversion was found to be more important than the inversion height in controlling the location of the upwind cloud edge over the lake, with increases in stability corresponding to eastward shifts in its location.

J	Kozlenko, N; Jeffries, MO				Kozlenko, N; Jeffries, MO			Bathymetric mapping of shallow water in thaw lakes on the North Slope of Alaska with spaceborne imaging radar	ARCTIC												Few bathymetric maps are available for the thousands of thaw lakes on the North Slope of Alaska. We describe a semiautomated procedure for bathymetric mapping of water up to 2 m deep (i.e., less deep than the maximum ice thickness) in these lakes. A sequence of ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and a simulated ice growth curve for winter 1991-92 are used to derive a digital elevation model of lake basins. The method is based on discriminating between floating ice and grounded ice in the SAR images to define raw isobaths; assigning an ice thickness or water depth to each isobath from the simulated ice-growth curve, and interpolating to create equally spaced (0.25 m) isobaths. There is modest agreement between SAR-derived maps and the few available bathymetric maps. Differences between the SAR maps and the original maps are probably unavoidable because of different production methods and original data formats. The concept of using SAR and a simulated ice-growth curve for bathymetric mapping of thaw lakes would benefit from verification based on a comparison with new maps derived from accurate field measurements at a selection of lakes with different morphological characteristics. Nevertheless, it is concluded that this technique is sound and could be used routinely for inexpensive and accurate bathymetric mapping across the entire North Slope and elsewhere (e.g., in Siberia, where large numbers of thaw lakes also occur). Such mapping would greatly increase the amount and spatial coverage of bathymetric data and would provide an accurate baseline against which to detect changes in the size, shape, bottom topography, and location of lakes.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2000	53	3					306	316																WOS:000089687100010
J	Ding, ZY; Han, GL; Qu, R; Liu, JK; Wang, P				Ding, Ziyang; Han, Guilin; Qu, Rui; Liu, Jinke; Wang, Peng			Review on Zinc Isotopes in River Systems: Distribution and Application	WATER												Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element widely present in rivers and plays a crucial role in ecosystems. Human activities have led to the extensive migration and dissemination of Zn in the environment. When the accumulation of Zn in rivers reaches excessive levels, it transforms into a potentially harmful contaminant. Consequently, tracing Zn's origin by its isotope ratios (delta Zn-66) from natural and anthropogenic sources is essential for the management of and safeguarding against river pollution and comprehending Zn behavior in rivers as well. This review presents the advancements in Zn isotope research in river environments, including a summary of Zn isotope measurement, the distribution and controlling factors (mineral adsorption, precipitation, and biological effects) of Zn isotopes, and the applications of Zn isotopes in rivers. The median delta Zn-66 values for uncontaminated river water and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were 0.37 parts per thousand and 0.22 parts per thousand, respectively, close to the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) value of 0.28 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand. With respect to the contaminated river, delta Zn-66 falls within -0.73 parts per thousand to 1.77 parts per thousand, with it being heavily influenced by anthropogenic sources, such as the electroplating and metal processing industries. Apart from contamination identification, this review summarizes the river material exchange process and the delta Zn-66 values of rainwater (-0.2 parts per thousand similar to 0.38 parts per thousand), groundwater (-0.13 parts per thousand similar to 1.4 parts per thousand), lake water (-0.66 parts per thousand similar to 0.21 parts per thousand), and seawater (-1.1 parts per thousand similar to 0.9 parts per thousand), which facilitates a holistic understanding of the Zn cycle and isotope fractionation in the river system. In conclusion, Zn isotopes are an effective tool for tracing pollution sources and Zn migration processes, with enormous unexplored potential. Therefore, this review finally summarizes some challenges and future directions in current research on Zn isotopes.					; Peng, Wang/CAA-2606-2022; Han, Guilin/C-2402-2013	Wang, Peng/0000-0002-2209-6360; Han, Guilin/0000-0002-0848-7648; ding, ziyang/0009-0007-1111-554X; Qu, Rui/0000-0001-6299-1645; 														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	1							87	10.3390/w16010087	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16010087													WOS:001141302700001
J	Robertshaw, P; Taylor, D				Robertshaw, P; Taylor, D			Climate change and the rise of political complexity in western Uganda	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN HISTORY												Climate changes, particularly droughts, have long been thought to have been profoundly influential in the pre-colonial history of the Great Lakes region. However, previous attempts at synthesis of archaeological, historical and palaeoenvironmental evidence were undermined by the paucity of the data, as well as by dating and other interpretative conundrums. The results of recent archaeological excavations and surveys, particularly at some of the major earthworks and shrine sites in western Uganda have now provided a wealth of new information concerning the settlement histories of these sites and their subsistence and political economies. It is clear, for example, that agriculture was more important in the economy of the inhabitants of the Cwezi shrine sites and the earthworks that succeeded them than has been thought previously. These data are complemented by new palaeoenvironmental evidence, particularly a well-dated pollen core from Kabata Swamp, which has provided a detailed history of vegetation changes over the last 2,000 years. Other recent studies, especially research on the Rodah Nilometer records, further bolster the reconstruction. Correlation of the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data demonstrates that the rise and fall of complex polities in pre-colonial western Uganda can be linked with climate changes, though climate change alone is insufficient explanation of these historical processes. In particular, the occupation of the Cwezi shrine sites may be correlated with a period of aridity that may have been influential in promoting economic and political insecurity. The subsequent florescence of the earthworks settlements correlates with higher rainfall and forest clearance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while the abandonment of these sites coincides with the return of the arid conditions of the 'Little Ice Age'.					; Taylor, David/ISS-5752-2023	Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636; 													0021-8537						2000	41	1					1	28		10.1017/S0021853799007653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021853799007653													WOS:000087025600001
J	Elliot, MB; Flenley, JR; Sutton, DG				Elliot, MB; Flenley, JR; Sutton, DG			A late Holocene pollen record of deforestation and environmental change from the Lake Tauanui catchment, Northland, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Late Holocene pollen and sediment records from the Lake Tauanui catchment, northern New Zealand, indicate that the lake formed about 5500 years ago following a series of volcanic events in the Tauanui Volcanic Centre. These volcanic events initiated a volcanosere resulting in a mixed conifer-hardwood forest. Dacrydium cupressinum was the dominant tree. Agathis australis was always present. Changes similar to those registered in other Northland pollen diagrams are apparent. At ca 4000 yr B.P., when the climate became cooler and drier than before, a fire occurred in the catchment area causing erosion of the surrounding slopes and some destruction of forest. Fluctuations in abundance of many forest species, including Ascarina lucida, A. australis and D. cupressinum, from ca 3500 yr B.P. indicate repeated disturbance, increasingly so after 1600 yr B.P. Summer droughts and increased frequency of cyclonic winds are suggested as the cause. Major anthropogenic deforestation events defined by palynology occurred across many parts of the New Zealand landscape at ca 700 yr B.P. At Lake Tauanui anthropogenic forest disturbance, radiocarbon dated to ca 1000 yr B.P., is indicated by significant decline in all tree and shrub elements with concomitant increase in pteridophytes, especially Pteridium esculentum. Charcoal concentration increases steadily from the onset of disturbance, and in the final phase after the arrival of Europeans, major clearance of vegetation is indicated. Herbs increase markedly in this period, in diversity and abundance.																			0921-2728					JAN	1998	19	1					23	32		10.1023/A:1007921021661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007921021661													WOS:000073093300002

Mean annual air temperatures were estimated using the oxygen isotope composition of contemporaneous rodent teeth. The studied aquatic fossils come from two boreholes in the Zsambek basin (northern central Hungary), while the terrestrial ones are from localities in NE Hungary and E Romania. In the studied Sarmatian successions, three zones could be distinguished, based on palaeontological and geochemical results. At the Badenian/Sarmatian boundary, faunal diversity decreased markedly. In the lower zone a transgressive event culminated in a seawater incursion into the semi-open basin system of the Central Paratheys. Stable bottom-water temperature (similar to 15 degrees C) and variable salinites (20-22%) are estimated for the Early Sarmatian Sea. The faunal changes (notably a strong reduction in biodiversity) occuring at the boundary between the lower and the middle zone can be explained by a sea-leval highstand with dysoxic conditions. A relative sea-level fall is documented at the end of this middle zone. After a short regressive event, a marine connection between the Paratethys and Mediterranean was established at the beginning of the upper zone. This is indicated by an increased microfaunal diversity and the re-appearance of marine Bademan ostracods and foraminifera, which are completely absent from the older Samatian series. During the upper zone, the temperatures and salmities are estimated to have fluctuated from 15 degrees C to 21 degrees C and from 15 parts per thousand to 43 parts per thousand, respectively.

Partitioning phosphorus concentrations and loads in tributaries of a recovering urban lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The partitioning of phosphorus (P) loading to culturally eutrophic lakes according to sources is fundamental information to guide rehabilitation programs and support mathematical models. Patterns of concentrations and loading rates of forms of P are documented for the major tributaries of Onondaga Lake, New York, United States, an urban lake that has recently demonstrated marked recovery from extreme cultural eutrophy as a result of decreased P loading from a domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This analysis is based on long-term (19 yr) biweekly monitoring of total, dissolved, and soluble reactive forms of P at the mouths of the three largest tributaries, and shorter-term higher frequency monitoring of one of the streams at two sites to resolve rural versus urban contributions. Signatures of anthropogenic sources were identified, including: (1) combined sewer overflows, (2) leaky sewers or other dry weather discharges, and (3) hydrogeologic sediment sources. On an annual average basis, the prevailing tributary and WWTP contributions to the total P load are approximately 70 and 30%, respectively. However, in terms of effective P loading, that which can be used to support primary production during the critical summer months, the tributaries contributed substantially less (similar to 35%) of the P load. Under the prevailing WWTP loading rate, reductions in tributary loading from aggressive tributary loading management efforts (e. g., 20-30% decrease) would not be expected to yield conspicuous improvements in related features of lake water quality. However, noteworthy improvements are a reasonable expectation from such tributary management efforts following the mandated further reductions in WWTP loading.

Understanding farmers' conservation behavior over time: A longitudinal application of the transtheoretical model of behavior change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Global waterbodies are experiencing increased risk of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms due to excess nutrients including phosphorus and nitrogen discharged from human activity on the landscape and as a result of climate change. Despite modeling that suggests the efficacy of best management practices in agricultural systems to be sufficient to address the problem, adoption by farmers remains far below the levels needed to achieve significant water quality improvements and new approaches to encourage and sustain adoption are urgently needed. In this work, we apply a modified transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change to a longitudinal dataset (N = 584) of farmers' adoption decisions and stated intentions to use cover crops, collected in the Maumee Basin of Lake Erie, USA in 2016 and 2018. The TTM posits that behavior changes over time and is influenced by different social-psychological processes at each stage of change. Our findings confirm past research into the importance of many of the factors investigated, while providing new insight into their role in specific stages of the change process with potential implications for the design of interventions for farmers in different stages. Several factors investigated (mean environmental concern, education, information from conservation groups and off-farm income) were uniquely important to a particular stage. Other factors (response efficacy at the field level, total farm size and risks of spring planting interference) were important at both an earlier and later stage, but less important in predicting middle stages of change. A third set of factors (self-efficacy, proportion rented, no-till adoption and uncertain long-term paybacks) were statistically important across each stage of the TTM model. In applying the TTM longitudinally, we found evidence that farmers in a more advanced stage of cover crop adoption, in the first wave of data collection (2016) were more likely to have adopted cover crops in the second wave (2018), a result not predicted by individual factors alone. We report findings for cover crops but see the potential for the transtheoretical model of behavior change to be applied to other best management practice adoption decisions and to diverse populations of farmers to generate similarly novel insight and utility for intervention design and targeting.

The observations were carried out in 1977-1979. The species occurs mainly on the forestless banks of big and small rivers (Aldan river valley and valleys of its main tributaries: Uchur, Maya, Allakh-Yun, etc.), humid riverside hay fields, periphery of bent meadow and mossy bogs, valley larch forests, borders of mixed forest and willowbirch small insular groves. Unlike R. amurensis, it populates the cultivated landscapes (fields, gardens), including rather big settlements. The wintering begins in Sept. and takes place in deep unfrozen lakes in rivers. The frogs come out of the water bodies between the end of April and the beginning of May. The male nuptial calls are registered in the beginning of May. In 1979 the spawning took place from May 8 until May 22, mainly from May 13 until May 16 when the temperature of surface water near the bank equaled 10-16.degree.. The development of tadpoles in nature lasts 56-65, sometimes 70-80 days. The 1st young of the year appear on the ground on the 13-15th of July (13-20 mm in body size); the development of tadpoles in Yakutia proceeds at a greater rate than in the Far East Marine territory. The frogs feed mainly on mollusks, arachnids and insects.																			0044-5134						1981	60	6					866	870																WOS:A1981LX44500007
J	Mieczan, T				Mieczan, T			Periphytic ciliates in littoral zone of three lakes of different trophic status	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Periphytic ciliate communities were investigated in three lakes of different trophic status of the Leczynsko-Wlodawskie Lake District (Eastern Poland). Observations were made of the periphyton growing on glass-slides. Samples were taken from April to November 2000-2001. Once a month, four periphyton samples were collected in littoral zone. Seventy three ciliate taxa occurred in the studied lakes. The biggest number, 60 species, was found in eutrophic lake, a little less, 55 species, in mesotrophic lake and the least, 49 species, in dystrophic lake. The lowest density was observed in mesotrophic lake and it was 13 x 10(3) ind. m(-2), being a little higher in dystrophic lake-16 x 10(3) ind. m(-2), and tile higilest 20 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) in eutrophic lake. All of the studied lakes were generally dominated by ciliates belonging to the order Cyrtophorida (Chilodonella uncinato Ehrenberg 1983) constituted >30% of tile total numbers. In all lakes bacterivorous ciliates occurred in the highest numbers (>50%), while algivorous and histophagous - in the lowest (<5%). In the eutrophic and dystrophic lakes the proportion of omnivorous and predator), species was high. The number of significant correlations differed among lakes. In mesotrophic lake the correlation between ciliates abundance and total organic carbon was found. In eutrophic lake total number of ciliates was positively correlated with the conductivity TP and TOC. In dystrophic lake the correlations between ciliates abundance and abiotic parameters were not observed. In mesotrophic and dystrophic lakes the content of organic matter positively correlated with the biomass of ciliates, while in cutrophic lake conductivity showed positive correlation with their biomass.

Effects on the fish population in Lake Lyng, Denmark	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				From 1990-1993 juvenile pike (Esox lucius) were stocked each spring in the eutrophic Lake Lyng (9.9 ha, max. depth 7.6 m, mean depth 2.4 m) in densities between 515 and 3616 pike ha(-1). In 1989-90 the fish population consisted mainly of roach (Rutilus rutilus), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), and total fish biomass was estimated at 477 kg ha(-1). Prior to stocking pike was not present in the lake. Following the first year of stocking, the density of roach, rudd and ruffe fry expressed as catch per unit effort decreased significantly by 64 to 97%. In 1991 ruffe disappeared completely. The pike stocking did not affect the density of perch significantly. The growth of pike was high and also the growth of perch increased significantly from 1990 to 1991 (p < 0.001) and from 1991 to 1994 (p < 0.001). We found a linear negative relationship between stocking density of pike in May or June and the abundance of juvenile planktivorous fish (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.05) in the littoral zone in August. No relationship was found in the pelagic zone (r(2) = 0.21, p > 0.4). Pike survival was low in late August/early September. We suggest that growth of the piscivorous perch increased due to increased Secchi depth and a continuous high density of 0+ planktivores in the pelagic zone of the lake during the years of pike stocking, possibly caused by behaviourial changes and the forcing of the 0+ planktivores into the pelagic zone.

Restoring hardwood trees to lake riparian areas using three planting treatments	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Lake riparian areas provide wildlife habitat for a wide variety of species. Residential development throughout such lakeshore areas of the United States has increased exponentially in recent decades. Awareness of the vulnerability and importance of lakeshore ecosystems has increased concurrently. Lakeshore habitat restoration projects have been implemented to mitigate some of the negative impacts of human shoreline development, and containerized (CT) trees are frequently one of the highest costs associated with such restoration projects. As an alternative, we tested the effectiveness of using dormant bare-root (BR) trees in restoration projects along two lakeshores in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. In addition, we experimented using BR stock that was incorporated into gravel medium at a local nursery and planted later in the summer months. We monitored growth and survival of four native tree species in these three planting treatments over a 3-4-year period. CT red maple (Acer rubra), paper birch (Betula paperifera), and northern red oak (Quercus rubra) increased in size significantly faster than BR and/or gravel culture (GC) counterparts, whereas CT showy mountain ash (Sorbus decora) growth rates were similar to those of BR and GC stock. Mortality was generally low, but for those species/planting treatments with higher mortality (paper birch and red oak), CT trees were more likely to survive than BR or GC trees. Our results show that the success of deciduous BR and/or GC tree stock relative to CT trees is species dependent, and for some species, CT trees' higher growth rates and survivorship could offset their higher costs.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2017	25	6					933	941		10.1111/rec.12520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12520													WOS:000414808200010
J	Hall, RO; Peredney, CL; Meyer, JL				Hall, RO; Peredney, CL; Meyer, JL			The effect of invertebrate consumption on bacterial transport in a mountain stream	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although laboratory studies have shown that filter-feeding invertebrates consume bacteria from stream water, no study has measured bacterial consumption in the field or determined system-level removal rates of sestonic bacteria. To examine bacterial removal rates and consumption by invertebrates, we released fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) into a second-order stream at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. We performed two 1-h releases during summer over bedrock habitat that supports many filter-feeders. We calculated uptake length and counted FLB in the guts of seven insect taxa. Uptake length was 78 and 83 m for the two releases, which corresponded to uptake rates of 4.03 and 3.69 x 10(7) cells m(-2) min(-1). Simulium, a filter-feeding blackfly larva, ingested FLB at a rate of 1.4 x 10(4) cells mg(-1) min(-1), 10 times the rate of other taxa. Diplectrona and Parapsyche, hydropsychid caddisfly filter-feeders, had ingestion rates between Simulium and other taxa. Epeorus, a scraping mayfly, and Tallaperla, a shredding stonefly, also ingested FLB, presumably from cells that adhered to the substrate. Invertebrate ingestion per square meter of stream bottom was 7% of total stream uptake, with Simulium responsible for 91% of the total invertebrate ingestion.

J	Lee, Y; Kim, SY; Jung, YT; Park, SE				Lee, Yeji; Kim, Su-Young; Jung, Yoon Taek; Park, Sang-Eun			Monitoring Long-Term Land Cover Change in Central Yakutia Using Sparse Time Series Landsat Data	REMOTE SENSING												Recently, as global climate change and local disturbances such as wildfires continue, long- and short-term changes in the high-latitude vegetation systems have been observed in various studies. Although remote sensing technology using optical satellites has been widely used in understanding vegetation dynamics in high-latitude areas, there has been limited understanding of various landscape changes at different spatiotemporal scales, their mutual relationships, and overall long-term landscape changes. The objective of this study is to devise a change monitoring strategy that can effectively observe landscape changes at different spatiotemporal scales in the boreal ecosystems from temporally sparse time series remote sensing data. We presented a new post-classification-based change analysis scheme and applied it to time series Landsat data for the central Yakutian study area. Spectral variability between time series data has been a major problem in the analysis of changes that make it difficult to distinguish long- and short-term land cover changes from seasonal growth activities. To address this issue effectively, two ideas in the time series classification, such as the stepwise classification and the lateral stacking strategies were implemented in the classification process. The proposed classification results showed consistently higher overall accuracies of more than 90% obtained in all classes throughout the study period. The temporal classification results revealed the distinct spatial and temporal patterns of the land cover changes in central Yakutia. The spatiotemporal distribution of the short-term class illustrated that the ecosystem disturbance caused by fire could be affected by local thermal and hydrological conditions of the active layer as well as climatic conditions. On the other hand, the long-term class changes revealed land cover trajectories that could not be explained by monotonic increase or decrease. To characterize the long-term land cover change patterns, we applied a piecewise linear model with two line segments to areal class changes. During the former half of the study period, which corresponds to the 2000s, the areal expansion of lakes on the eastern Lena River terrace was the dominant feature of the land cover change. On the other hand, the land cover changes in the latter half of the study period, which corresponds to the 2010s, exhibited that lake area decreased, particularly in the thermokarst lowlands close to the Lena and Aldan rivers. In this area, significant forest decline can also be identified during the 2010s.					; JUNG, YOON TAEK/MCH-1407-2025	Lee, Yeji/0009-0002-4863-9420; Park, Sang-Eun/0000-0003-0887-1348; 														2072-4292				JUN	2024	16	11							1868	10.3390/rs16111868	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16111868													WOS:001245568800001

In this context, the spatial distributions and causative factors of organic matter (OM) and heavy metal accumulations have been explored in modern lacustrine sediments of a large urbanized and protected wetland (ULB: Upper Lake Bhopal) in Central India. For this purpose, geochemical properties, in particular, stable isotopes ( delta 13 C and delta 15 N) were measured in the ULB surficial sediments (core depth -0 - 1 cm; n = 19), and additionally collected riverbed sediments (n = 2) and atmospheric free -fall dust samples (n = 3) from the lake periphery. The major and trace element data indicate widespread mafic sediment provenance and nearly dysoxic lacustrine conditions. The riverine supply of soil OM from cropped lands and the lake productivity (algae, largely sustained by nutrients from sewage and agricultural runoff) are the major OM sources to the western and eastern lake portions, respectively. The fractional contribution from autochthonous TOC (-0.19 - 0.95, mean -0.62) predominates that of allochthonous TOC (-0.05 - 0.81, mean -0.38). Whereas, atmospheric dust deposition is a primary anthropogenic source of heavy metals (Pb and Zn). The lake productivity rather than soil OM or any mineral sorbent is found responsible for the anthropogenic enrichments of Pb and Zn in the ULB surficial sediments, especially on the eastern ULB portion under high anthropogenic pressure. Therefore, the settled OM (primarily autochthonous) being oxidizable acts as a temporary but major sink of anthropogenic heavy metals in modern lacustrine sediments, which are vulnerable to heavy metal efflux to the water column by sediment diagenesis.					; Singh, Satinder Pal/OAJ-5580-2025	Rout, Rakesh Kumar/0000-0001-9716-7787; Singh, Satinder/0000-0001-7510-5980; Ahmad, Nafees/0000-0001-6514-6674; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAY 15	2024	349				SI				123964	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123964		APR 2024						38631445					WOS:001232718600001
J	CERLING, TE				CERLING, TE			PALEOCHEMISTRY OF PLIO-PLEISTOCENE LAKE TURKANA, KENYA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The paleochemistry of Plio-Pleistocene Lake Turkana can be estimated by using the chemistry of lakes from the Eastern Rift of Africa as an analog. Most modern East African lakes occupy closed basins; their chemistries follow an evaporation trend defined by the precipitation of certain mineral phases with increasing alkalinity. Estimates of paleoalkalinity can be used to closely estimate the chemical composition of ancient lakes. Three methods are used to estimate paleoalkalinity. Diatoms, mollusks and fish have certain metabolic requirements that are dependent on pH, alkalinity or Ca levels; thus fauna and flora can be used as paleoalkalinity indicators. Exchangeable cations on clay minerals can also be used because the relative concentrations of Na and Ca in lake waters are related to alkalinity. Absence or presence of certain minerals also can serve as a paleoalkalinity indicator. Although the latter 2 techniques give estimates of paleoalkalinity that are averaged over several hundred or thousand yr, their estimates agree with the instantaneous estimates based on biologic considerations. The earliest lake phase was very fresh and continued until the end of the Kubi Algi Formation. The Lower Member of the Koobi Fora Formation was a fresh- to brackish-water lake. From the beginning of Upper Member time (about 1.8 million/yr ago) to the present, the lake occupying the Turkana Depression has varied from a brackish lake that overflowed to a closed basin lake that fell below overflow level and whose alkalinity rose to .apprx. 200 meq/l.

The Great Hinggan Mountains are located on the margin of the East Asian monsoon region, and BC from fossil fuel sources could be deposited in this region through transport by westerlies and the monsoon. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the sources and intensity of BC deposited during the last 150 years in the Great Hinggan Mountains, Northeast China. BC concentrations, stable carbon isotope values of BC (delta C-13-BC), and charcoal counts in the Motianling (MP2) peatland were measured in this study. BC values measured via the chemical method were regarded as total BC concentrations, and the BC values measured via the microscope method (i.e., charcoal) represent BC from biomass burning. The results showed that BC in MP2 peatland was mainly produced from local fire events before the 1930s. After the 1930s, with the increase in European fossil fuel BC emissions, the BC produced by fossil fuels became the major BC sources in the MP2 peatland, and the total BC fluxes in the MP2 peatland were much higher than those before the 1930s. With the decrease in European BC emissions and increase in Chinese BC emissions after the 1970s, the BC emitted by China became the major fossil fuel BC source in the MP2 peatland. However, the implementation of environmentally friendly policies decreased the BC emissions from fire events, leading to the gradual decrease in BC depositional fluxes in recent years. In recent years, fossil fuels remain the major sources of BC, but the implementation of environmentally friendly policies has decreased fossil fuel BC emissions, leading to the gradual decrease in BC depositional fluxes in the Great Hinggan Mountains.

Four distinct climatic phases were delineated based on sedimentological, geochemical, and End Member Modelling Analysis (EMMA) results. Phase 1 (3330-3100 cal BP) is a short-term low rainfall zone characterized by a calm hydrodynamic environment and weak chemical weathering. Phase 2 (3100-2800 cal BP) is a climatically unstable phase, fluctuating between low and high rainfall conditions. Phase 3 (2800-2200 cal BP) is characterized by a stable, low rainfall climate with weak fluvial activity and chemical weathering. It is followed by a highly unstable phase marked by frequent extreme climatic events (Phase 4; 2200-1830 cal BP). Our study reveals a highly unstable hydrodynamic condition that culminated in potentially catastrophic high rainfall events that triggered intense and frequent floods in southern India around similar to 2208, 2054, 1958, and 1891 cal BP. Comparative studies of regional records show that the regional climate pattern is similar. There is a strong effect of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), Sea Surface Temperature (SST) off the Malabar coast, location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the monsoon system in southern India. This suggests that there is a global teleconnection.

Even the highest peaks above 6,700 m in the continuous permafrost belt are currently free of glaciers, and modern recharge of the water cycle is restricted to small catchments at high altitude. The vegetation between 3,100 and 4,800 m is too sparse to initiate any soil formation. The temperatures of the last cold maximum (18 kyr B.P) were probably 7-degrees-C lower than today. The late-glacial period (17-11 kyr B.P.) was characterized by 5-10 m higher lake levels, indicating a large increase in precipitation at latitude 23-24-degrees South. The early Holocene (11-7 kyr B.P.) experienced wetter conditions and summer temperatures 3.5-degrees-C higher than today, together with significant groundwater recharge. This provided favorable conditions for an early hunter-gatherer economy. After about 3000 B.P. conditions became drier; intensive pastoralism may have added to the impacts on vegetation cover, and groundwater recharge was curtailed. Natural resource management policies must take into account the dynamics of a changing environment. Present-day reliance on groundwater for mining, urbanization, and agriculture cannot be sustained, for supplies are believed to be fossil water, or else the recharge rate is so slow that actual use may far exceed replenishment.

Genetic variation of fish parasite populations in historically connected habitats:: undetected habitat fragmentation effect on populations of the nematode Procamallanus fulvidraconis in the catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Habitat fragmentation may have some significant effects on population genetic structure because geographic distance and physical barriers may impede gene flow between populations. In this study, we investigated whether recent habitat fragmentation affected genetic structure and diversity of populations of the nematode Procamallanus fulvidraconis in the yellowhead catfish, Pelteobagrus fin't4draco. The nematode was collected from 12 localities in 7 floodplain lakes of the Yangtze River. Using I I intersirnple sequence repeat markers, analysis of molecular variance showed that genetic diversity occurred mainly within populations (70.26%). Expected heterozygosity (He) of P. fulvidraconis was barely different between connected (0.2105) and unconnected lakes (0.2083). Population subdivision (Fst) between connected lakes (0.2177) was higher than in unconnected lakes (0. 1676). However, the connected and unconnected lakes did not Cluster into 2 clades. A Mantel test revealed significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances (R = 0.5335, P < 0.01). These results suggest that habitat fragmentation did not cause genetic differentiation among populations or a reduction of diversity in isolated populations of P. fulvidraconis. At least 2 factors may increase the dispersal range of the nematode, i.e., flash flooding in summer and other species of fish that may serve as the definitive hosts. Moreover, lake fragmentation is probably a recent process; population size of the nematode in these lakes is large enough to maintain Population structure.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				JUN	2008	94	3					643	647											18605774					WOS:000257411200013

Protists, especially heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), consumed most of bacterial production (50%-100%) in all 3 reservoirs over an annual cycle, except for the short clear-water phase. However, with increasing trophy of the systems, ciliates become as important bacterivores as HNF Despite large differences in reservoir characteristics, basically the same taxonomic groups of HNF (chrysomonads, bodonids and choanoflagellates) and ciliates (small oligotrichs dominated by Halteria grandinella, vorticellids and scuticociliates) were found to be the principal bacterioplankton consumers. A longitudinal transect through the eutrophic Sau Reservoir showed a conspicuous gradient from the organically loaded river with the high allochtonous bacterial production followed by a succession of I-INF replaced at the downstream stations by a peak of ciliates dominated by H. grandinella. At the first reservoir station, where extreme protozoan bacterivory was twice bacterial production, a conspicuous compositional shift in bacterioplankton composition was observed as revealed by means of group specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. This shift was mediated namely by decreasing proportions of bacterial genotypes belonging to beta-subclass of the class Proteobacteria and to Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group.

In this study, we use the sensitive high resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) for dating 25-mum diameter areas on individual zircons from Piedmont granitoids in an effort to resolve previous controversial ages. Cathodoluminescence images of zoning within the zircons are used to select pristine areas of cores and overgrowths for dating and to help interpret die results. For comparison, hand-picked fractions of zircons from most of die samples were also dated by the conventional isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) U-Pb method. The combined SHRIMP and TIMS results of this study demonstrate that the Dale City Quartz Monzonite, Norbeck Intrusive Suite, Kensington Tonalite, Goldvein pluton, Lake Jackson pluton, Falls Church Intrusive Suite, Occoquan Granite (main batholith and satellite Bull Run Marina pluton), Georgetown Intrusive Suite, Dalecarlia Intrusive Suite, and related granitoids are parts of an extensive Early to Middle Ordovician magmatic arc. Emplacement of these plutons from about 485 to 450 Ma generally was contemporaneous with major regional deformation mid metamorphism, called the Taconic orogeny in rocks of the northern Appalachians. The Ordovician ages supersede most of the discordant Cambrian(?) to Neoproterozoic dates that previously suggested a Potomac or Penobscot orogeny in Piedmont rocks of the Potomac Valley, raising questions about the nature and timing of that event. The Devonian Guilford Granite crosscuts all structures, providing a minimum age for these Paleozoic events.

Satellite data and in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Oceanographic measurements and satellite images recorded during the same period show that the data from the visible wavelengths of channel 1 and 2 of the AVHRR sensor (satellite NOAA-11) can be used to establish the distribution of total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) on the inshore continental shelves. The near-infrared channel (C2 = 725-1100 nn) is used for atmospheric corrections of channel C1 (580-680 nm) when concentrations in TSPM are low. However, when TSPM are high, they influence the channel C2 data. In this case, we use a subtraction between C1 data and a C1 value as constant. The fit function obtained between the TSPM measured by filtration and the corrected satellite reflectances is relatively linear for the low concentrations. This fit function permits to attribute an estimated concentration value to each satellite reflectance. In the Bay of Biscay, the additional use of a multiparameter probe and of AVHRR/NOAA-11 infrared data (channels 4 and 5, thermic infrared) makes it possible to show the presence of a coastal upwelling. The cold water rises to the surface near the coast. It is enriched in suspended matter, both removed by the waves and discharged by the rivers. These waters are then driven westwards, by the tidal currents and the continental northerly winds. The observation of complementary data showed that the coastal upwelling was active during the entire summer period of 1989 and possibly contributed to the cooling of coastal waters.																			0924-7963					MAY	1996	8	1-2					91	105		10.1016/0924-7963(95)00040-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0924-7963(95)00040-2													WOS:A1996UM24200005
J	Allred, BJ				Allred, Barry J.			Laboratory Evaluation of Zero Valent Iron and Sulfur-Modified Iron for Agricultural Drainage Water Treatment	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION												Agricultural subsurface drainage waters containing nutrients (nitrate/phosphate) and pesticides are discharged into neighboring streams and lakes, frequently producing adverse environmental impacts on local, regional, and national scales. On-site drainage water filter treatment systems can potentially prevent the release of agricultural contaminants into adjacent waterways. Zero valent iron (ZVI) and sulfur-modified iron (SMI) are two types of promising filter materials that could be used within these treatment systems. Therefore, water treatment capabilities of three ZVI and three SMI filter materials were evaluated in the laboratory. Laboratory evaluation included saturated falling-head hydraulic conductivity tests, contaminant removal batch tests, and saturated solute transport column experiments. The three ZVI and the three SMI filter materials, on average, all had a sufficient hydraulic conductivity greater than 1 x 10(3) cm/s. Batch test results showed a phosphate decrease of at least 94% for all tests conducted with the ZVI and SMI. Furthermore, the three SMI filter materials removed at least 86% of the batch test nitrate originally present, while batch tests for one of the ZVI filter materials exhibited an 88% decrease in the pesticide, atrazine. Saturated solute transport column experiments were carried on the best ZVI filter material, or the best SMI filter material, or both together, in order to better evaluate drainage water treatment effectiveness and efficiency. Results from these column tests additionally document the drainage water treatment ability of both ZVI and SMI to remove the phosphate, the ability of SMI to remove nitrate, and the ability of a select ZVI material to remove atrazine. Consequently, these findings support further investigation of ZVI and SMI subsurface drainage water treatment capabilities, particularly in regard to small- and large-scale field tests.																			1069-3629					SPR	2012	32	2					81	95		10.1111/j.1745-6592.2011.01379.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2011.01379.x													WOS:000303595600007

The sediments comprise an upper unit of generally non-laminated, banded to massive silts and peats of mid- to late-Holocene age, overlying a laminated unit of late-Pleistocene to early/mid-Holocene age. The laminae, comprising mainly aragonite, amorphous silica (diatom frustules) and organic matter were formed in a relatively deep, dilute, meromictic lake. Pollen data indicate an abrupt replacement of Artemisia-chenopod steppe by grass-oak-terebinth parkland during the period of laminae deposition, marking the start of the Holocene. A gradual increase in tree pollen during the early Holocene came to an end c. 6500 cal. yr BP (U-series and adjusted C-14 timescale), when mesic deciduous taxa declined at the same time as lake levels fell. Human impact on regional vegetation is inferred from a sharp decline in oak around 4500-4000 cal. yr BP. Diatom, isotopic and mineralogical data indicate that during the second half of the Holocene the lake became relatively shallow and oscillated between fresh and brackish/evaporated water conditions. The contrast between wetter early- and drier late-Holocene climatic conditions is matched by other eastern and central Mediterranean proxy climate data. While the Eski Acigol sequence resembles Holocene hydroclimatic changes in the Saharo-Arabian zone and was also apparently linked to orbital forcing, it is unlikely to have had the same direct cause, i.e., an expansion and subsequent retreat of monsoon rainfall.					karabıyıkoğlu, mustafa/AAD-7443-2019; Black, Stuart/A-1099-2014; Roberts, Nick/C-2694-2008	Black, Stuart/0000-0003-1396-4821; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; 													0959-6836	1477-0911					2001	11	6					721	736		10.1191/09596830195744	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/09596830195744													WOS:000171795200009

Laguna Timone is a hypersaline crater lake located in a Pleistocene maar of the Pali Aike Volcanic Field, southern Patagonia; the lake was formed during basaltic eruptions in a periglacial setting. Here, we report the first integrative characterization of microbial communities from biofilms and microbial mats in this lake using high-throughput 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing, along with mineralogical and hydrochemical analyses of water, sediments, and carbonates. Bacterial communities were dominated by the genera Enterobacterales ASV1, Pseudomonas, Oscillatoria, Nodularia, and Belliella, with site-specific assemblages. Fungal communities included Laetinaevia, Ilyonectria, Thelebolus, Plectosphaerella, and Acrostalagmus, each showing distinct distribution patterns. These baseline data contribute to understanding microbial dynamics in hypersaline maar environments and support future investigations. This integrative approach highlights key microbe-mineral relationships and underscores the potential of Laguna Timone as a natural laboratory for exploring biosignature formation and microbial adaptation in chemically extreme environments, both on early Earth and potentially beyond.

Anthropogenic litter and plastics across size classes on a mechanically groomed Great Lakes urban beach	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Anthropogenic litter and plastic pollution are well-recognized global and Great Lakes stressors, but the distribution of plastic pollution on shorelines is uneven. Beaches in urban areas are close to many potential sources of plastic pollution and often heavily visited, so are likely exposed to high litter inputs. Conversely, beach maintenance activities, including mechanical grooming, may lower litter concentrations. In the summer of 2021, surface litter and > 2 mm anthropogenic materials within the top 5 cm of beach sediment were repeatedly measured along 10 transects at Euclid Beach, in Cleveland, Ohio. Plastics comprised 79 % of litter > 50 mm and 100 % of smaller visible litter on the beach surface. Surface litter concentrations (0.279 pieces m(-2)) were relatively low compared to previously studied Great Lakes strandlines, with mechanical grooming and beach visitor usage influencing litter distribution. However, when plastics within the top 5 cm of the beach sediment were included, Euclid Beach microplastics (54.7 pieces m(-2)) and mesoplastics (45.0 pieces m(-2)) concentrations were among the highest in the Great Lakes. Plastic production pellets were the most common microplastic morphology, while foamed plastics were the most common mesoplastics. Most plastics in the sediment were too small to be removed by mechanical grooming, but fragmentation of larger, weathered plastics is a potential concern deserving further investigation. Overall, our results suggest that urban, mechanically-groomed beaches can have high plastics loads. Such beaches should be strategically included in larger scale studies of plastic pollution along shorelines, especially when considering issues of environmental justice.					; Jefferson, Anne/K-1185-2012; Rowan, Christopher/K-4185-2012	Jefferson, Anne/0000-0002-0585-9602; 													0380-1330					APR	2025	51	2							102505	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102505		MAR 2025											WOS:001449314000001

The lithofacies successions comprise mainly chemical, microbial related and clastic carbonates that record deposition in a shallow alkaline lake with high concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, Si4+, and CO32-. The first basin evolution stage is represented by the lower petrographic interval, with clastic sediments mainly delivered from older formations exposed in the NE-SW trending Tupi High. Springs related to active faults provided fluids charged with ions to the basin, leading to development of travertine arcs and lacustrine chemical deposits. The transition to the second stage is marked by the intermediate interval which records an upward decrease of terrigenous clastic material indicating a gradual reduction of the uplift rate of the source area. At the third stage a less stressful environment facilitated the development of microbial related carbonate deposits. The data also revealed that both the top and the base of the Barra Velha Formation are defined by flooding surfaces which permit to consider the formation as a syn-rift tectonic sequence.

An Evaluation of Age-1 Steelhead Stocking Locations on a Minnesota Tributary to Lake Superior	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Historically, less than 2% of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked in river mouths on Minnesota tributaries to Lake Superior returned as adults. To investigate the influence of stocking location on adult return rates, similar proportions of age-1 steelhead were stocked in the mouth and throughout upstream reaches of the Knife River. A subset of steelhead stocked upstream were implanted with coded wire tags (CWT), which resulted in 18% of all fish stocked, regardless of location, possessing a CWT. A fish trap near the mouth of the river was used to sample emigrating age-0 through age-3 juveniles and returning adults. Of the steelhead stocked upstream 45% survived to emigrate. Electrofishing surveys and trap results indicated no steelhead remained in the river past age 2. No evidence was found that larger age-1 stocked steelhead displaced smaller age-1 wild steelhead. Only 12% of returning adults possessed CWTs, 6% less than the percentage stocked with CWTs (18%). Adult return rates for those stocked in the river mouth were 1.0% compared with 0.5% for those stocked upstream. Overall, stocking in the river mouth contributed 69% of the returning adults. Given these results, Minnesota fishery managers should continue to look for alternate ways to increase steelhead return rates if greater adult numbers are desired.

The influence of dynamic environmental interactions on detection efficiency of acoustic transmitters in a large, deep, freshwater lake	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												BackgroundAcoustic telemetry is an increasingly common method used to address ecological questions about the movement, behaviour, and survival of freshwater and marine organisms. The variable performance of acoustic telemetry equipment and ability of receivers to detect signals from transmitters have been well studied in marine and coral reef environments to inform study design and improve data interpretation. Despite the growing use of acoustic telemetry in large, deep, freshwater systems, detection efficiency and range, particularly in relation to environmental variation, are poorly understood. We used an array of 90 69-kHz acoustic receivers and 8 sentinel range transmitters of varying power output deployed at different depths and locations approximately 100-9500 m apart for 215 days to evaluate how the detection efficiency of acoustic receivers varied spatially and temporally in relation to environmental conditions.ResultsThe maximum distance that tags were detected ranged from 5.9 to 9.3 km. Shallow tags consistently had lower detection efficiency than deep tags of the same power output and detection efficiency declined through the winter months (December-February) of the study. In addition to the distance between tag and receiver, thermocline strength, surface water velocity, ice thickness, water temperature, depth range between tag and receiver, and number of fish detections contributed to explaining variation in detection efficiency throughout the study period. Furthermore, the most significant models incorporated interactions between several environmental variables and tag-receiver distance, demonstrating the complex temporal and spatial relationships that exist in heterogeneous environments.ConclusionsRelying on individual environmental variables in isolation to interpret receiver performance, and thus animal behaviour, may be erroneous when detection efficiency varies across distances, depths, or tag types. As acoustic telemetry becomes more widely used to study ecology and inform management, it is crucial to understand its limitations in heterogeneous environments, such as freshwater lakes, to improve the quality and interpretation of data. We recommend that in situ range testing and retrospective analysis of detection efficiency be incorporated into study design for telemetry projects. Furthermore, we caution against oversimplifying the dynamic relationship between detection efficiency and environmental conditions for the sake of producing a correction that can be applied directly to detection data of tagged animals when the intended correction may not be justified.

J	Martin, ES; Harris, RP; Irigoien, X				Martin, Elena San; Harris, Roger P.; Irigoien, Xabier			Latitudinal variation in plankton size spectra in the Atlantic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The size distribution of the pelagic community has the potential to compare ecosystems with different species composition as well as to identify the main functional properties of the system. Plankton size spectra are an effective approach of summarising the size structure of the community and have the potential to indicate the transfer of energy up the trophic food web. However, data on which open ocean plankton biomass-size structure can be constructed are scarce. Here we present the latitudinal distribution in the Atlantic Ocean of normalised biomass-size spectra (NB-S), plankton biomass and abundance, as well as mean zooplankton size between 70 degrees N and 50 S. Samples were collected from three Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises during May/June 2003, September/October 2003 and April/June 2004, as well as from a Marine Productivity (MarProd) cruise farther north in the Irminger Sea during spring 2002. The biomass-size distribution covered a body size range from nano- to mesoplankton and was based on a depth range of 50-0m on the AMT and 120-0 m on the Irminger Sea cruise. The distribution of normalised biomass versus size was linear on a double log plot at all of the 95 stations. The slopes of the NB-S spectra ranged from -0.93 to -1.26 and -1.12 to -1.46 on the AMT and Irminger Sea cruises, respectively. A "dome-shaped" pattern in the slopes of community size spectra was observed in the Atlantic, indicating a decrease in the trophic transfer efficiency of energy with increasing latitude and phytoplankton biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass, abundance, and mean size followed a distribution similar to ecosystem productivity. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal patterns of ice formation, ice breakup, ice concentration, and breakup ice jams were analyzed. Investigation into how river ice phenology varied during the period 1985-2023 was performed using conventional trend analysis methods, alongside an examination of the teleconnections between ice phenology series and global climate oscillations. Complex spatiotemporal evolution of river ice across the Northeast United States was detailed, with notable influences of latitude on ice cover dynamics due to temperature variations from north to south highlighted. Leveraging 12 years of daily satellite observations, the necessity of integrating satellite imagery with in situ observations to develop a comprehensive river ice climatology was emphasized. Trend analysis indicated delays in ice formation by an average of 0.45 days per year and a tendency for earlier breakup by 0.24 days per year. However, these changes were not statistically significant. Trends in hydroclimatic variables, such as air temperature, snow cover, and rainfall, were discussed. Additionally, a considerable increase in mid-winter breakup ice jams frequency was revealed, with a significant change noted post-1992. The findings of this study pave the way for the development of regional river management strategies and adaptation to river ice-induced hazards.

(Scots pine) wood recovered from sites beyond the modern conifer tree-line on the Kola Peninsula of Russia. Twenty-one of the samples came from the shallow waters and eroding peats at the edges of two small lakes at 68 degrees 43'N, 35 degrees 10'E, located north of the modem conifer tree-line. Three samples came from a small pond located above the modem elevational limits of Pinus sylvestris at 68 degrees 25'N, 35 degrees 19'E. The radiocarbon dates indicate that pine trees grew approximately 20 km north of the mapped modern limits of the species from 6680 BP to 3830 BP. Pine trees were also growing some 40 m above their modern elevational limits between 5890 BP and 3450 BP. Nineteen of the samples date from 6680 BP to 5070 BP, suggesting that the density of trees north of the modern treeline was greatest between similar to 7000 and 5000 BP. The timing of tree-line advance and greatest density on the Kola Peninsula are in agreement with the results of similar studies from northern Fennoscandia which indicate that maximum northern and elevational extension of tree-line occurred between 7000 BP and 4000 BP. The general agreement between tree-line reconstructions suggests that the climatic changes that promoted mid-Holocene tree-line extension along the North Atlantic margins in northern Fennoscandia propagated eastward to the Kola Peninsula. The late timing of initial pine expansion on the Kola and in adjacent northern Fennoscandia remains problematic and may relate to lower winter insolation, temperature regimes in the adjacent oceans or slow rates of migration.

The 12 surface-cover types were mapped with an average accuracy of 88.8%, as compared with detailed ground truth. The classification of the LANDSAT data was accomplished through use of the Interactive Digital Image Manipulation System (IDIMS) available at the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The combined effects of a quantity and quality of ground truth, the use of the controlled clustering classification technique, and the prudent placement of Intensive Study Areas (ISA) on the image-processing CRT screen for training statistic collection provided very subtle spectral reflectance differences between coniferous tree species. Slope angle, slope aspect and surface-cover type variation, and to a lesser degree, crown size and crown density were the main environmental factors that accounted for spectral reflectance variation of surface-cover types within the park. Through an appreciation for the influence of environmental factors on the reflectance value of surface-cover types and an appreciation for the placement of training areas to sample the environmental effects on reflectance, one can reduce misclassification or nonclassification possibilities.

Thaw-induced impacts on land and water in discontinuous permafrost: A review of the Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield, northwestern Canada	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Rising air temperatures, intensifying wildfire activity, and human disturbance are driving rapid permafrost thaw across the subarctic, particularly for thaw-sensitive discontinuous permafrost. The Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield ecozones of northwestern Canada have experienced rapid and widespread permafrost thaw over recent decades, creating significant community concerns and knowledge gaps. In direct response, this review: (1) outlines the observed thaw-induced changes in landcover, hydrology, and water quality; (2) discusses the underlying drivers and mechanisms of these changes; and (3) identifies knowledge gaps to guide future research in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Taiga Plains and Shield (study region). In the Taiga Plains, permafrost is mainly associated with peatlands where its thaw increases the extent of thermokarst wetlands at the expense of treed peatlands underlain by permafrost. This thaw-induced landcover change enhances the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape, which increases basin-scale runoff and annual streamflow, and enables wetland drainage such that permafrost-free treed wetlands develop. Thaw-induced landcover changes in the lake- and bedrock-dominated Taiga Shield are not well known but are expected to occur as limited or minor thermokarst pond development and changing lake extent due to the low (<5%) peatland coverage of this ecozone. Permafrost thaw also increases the connectivity between surface water and groundwater, leading to increasing winter baseflows and possibly icing (aufeis) development. Such increases in hydrologic connectivity can enhance the mobilization of parameters of concern for water quality, both in the Taiga Plains and Shield. The thawing of peatlands will likely increase the transport and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and metals bound to organic compounds, including methylmercury. Further work is needed to fully understand the biogeochemical processes operating in these systems and the degree to which thawing peatlands will impact water quality and quantity at the larger basin scale. The greatest knowledge gaps across the study region surround the evolution of thaw-activated groundwater flow systems and the consequences for wetland biogeochemistry, the rates and patterns of permafrost thaw, contaminant transport, and streamflow of larger river systems. This synthesis not only informs future research directions in the study region but extends to similar subarctic peatland and Shield environments common throughout the circumpolar north.					; Olefeldt, David/E-8835-2013	Wright, Stephanie N./0000-0001-6034-0718; Thompson, Lauren M./0000-0002-6455-4980; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				SEP	2022	232								104104	10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104104		JUL 2022											WOS:000861724700003

The 1719-1721 CE Laoheishan-Huoshaoshan eruption, and the 1776 CE Laoheishan eruption are the latest eruptions in WDLC based on the local historical records. However, most of the recent explosive eruptive products around WDLC are attributed to the 1719-1721 CE Laoheishan-Huoshaoshan eruption while less attentions were paid on the 1776 CE Laoheishan eruption. There are two types of scoria fall deposits around Laoheishan volcano, i.e. the upper light grey high vesicular scoria deposit (US) and below dark low vesicular scoria deposit (BS). Most of the glass shards from US exhibit >4% Na2O while BS show <4% Na2O. In addition, US presents two different glass composition clusters, indicating a complex magma batch feeding the eruption. Broadly, all of these eruptive products from WDLC have extreme high potassium (usually >5%) content with trachyandesitic to tephriphonolitic in composition that can be clearly distinguished from those from other nearby volcanic regions, such as Nuomin (similar to 150 km to Nangelaqiushan lake (NGLQ)), Arxan-Chaihe (similar to 450 km to NGLQ), Longgang (similar to 700 km to NGLQ) and Jingbohu (similar to 550 km to NGLQ). A cryptotephra layer is clearly revealed as a distinct peak in magnetic susceptibility measurements from NGLQ similar to 8 km northwest to Laoheishan volcano. Glass composition of the cryptotephra layer recorded in NGLQ is similar to the proximal US around Laoheishan volcano. On basis of historical records and field observations, we ascribed US to the 1776 CE Laoheishan eruption and BS to the 1719-1721 CE Laoheishan-Huoshaoshan eruption. Consequently, historical records assigned a precise age (1776 CE) for the tephra recorded in NGLQ and thus can be used to refine the age model of these lacustrine sediments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Among 17 metal ions tested, inhibition of the chemiluminescence when CdSe QDs are oxidized by H2O2 was observed for Sb, Se and Cu. Liquid-liquid-liquid microextraction was implemented in order to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the chemiluminescent assay. Factors influencing both the CdSe QDs/H2O2 chemiluminescent system and microextraction process were optimized for ultrasensitive detection of Sb(III) and total Sb. In order to investigate the mechanism by which Sb ions inhibit the chemiluminescence of the CdSe QDs/H2O2 system, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption and fluorescence measurements were performed. The selection of the appropriate CdSe QDs capping ligand was found to be a critical issue. Immobilization of QDs caused the chemiluminescence signal to be enhanced by a factor of 100 as compared to experiments carried out with QDs dispersed in the bulk aqueous phase. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit was 6 ng L-1 Sb and the repeatability expressed as relative standard deviation (N = 7) was about 1.3%. An enrichment factor of 95 was achieved within only 3 min of microextraction. Several water samples including drinking, spring, and river waters were analyzed. The proposed method was validated against CRM NWTM-27.2 fortified lake water, and a recovery study was performed with different types of water samples. Sb recoveries ranged from 94 to 105%. A fast, miniaturized and relatively inexpensive assay for selective and sensitive detection of Sb(III) and total Sb in waters is accomplished. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	BARROW, JH; KELKER, N; MILLER, H				BARROW, JH; KELKER, N; MILLER, H			TRANSMISSION OF LEUCOCYTOZOON SIMONDI TO BIRDS BY SIMULIUM RUGGLESI IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The ornithophilic Simuliidae that feed on waterfowl were studied in northern Michigan. With the exception of one Cnephia sp., only Simulium rugglesi (Nicholson and Mickel) were collected attacking birds in Michigan during the study period from 15 April 1959 to 21 August, 1962. The number of flies trapped in Michigan was never comparable to similar collections in Canada and Wisconsin. Nevertheless, a high incidence of Leucocytozoon infection was observed in both Cheboygan and Presque Isle Counties near streams, in contrast to substantially lower incidences of infection and fatality of the lake front at the University of Michigan Biological Station and at Rlggsvllle (both in Cheboygan Co. and both away from streams). Host preference studies were made by exposing mallard ducks and 14 other species of birds. New host feeding records for S. rugglesi included black terns, herring gulls, black crown night herons, sandpipers, robin fledglings, and blackbird fledglings. S. rugglesi preferred ducks over all other birds except gulls and blackbirds, colored ducks and ducklings over white ducklings and over goslings of all colors. They preferred colored ducklings and large white ducklings over goslings. S. rugglesi transmits Leucocytozoon among summer resident birds rather than the birds migrating through this region of Michigan. Epizootic conditions here are therefore significantly different from those in areas with larger and earlier appearing S. rugglesi populations farther north.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1968	79	1					197	+		10.2307/2423165	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2423165													WOS:A1968A522000015

This is due to the strong spatial gradients of NOx and the dependence of its own chemical loss on such gradients. In this study, we use the GEOS-Chem CTM in its high-performance implementation (GCHP) to investigate NOx simulations over the eastern United States across a wide range of spatial model resolutions (six different horizontal grids from 13 to 181 km). Following increasing grid size, afternoon surface NO(x )mixing ratios over July 2015 generally decrease over the Great Lakes region (GL) and increase over the southern states of the US region (SS), yielding regional differences (181 km vs. 13 km) of -16 % (in the GL) to 7 % (in the SS); meanwhile, hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) increase over both regions, consistent with their different chemical regimes (i.e., NOx-saturated in the GL and NOx-limited in the SS). Nighttime titration of ozone by surface nitric oxide (NO) was found to be more efficient at coarser resolutions, leading to longer NOx lifetimes and higher surface mixing ratios of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the GL in January 2015. The tropospheric NO2 column density at typical afternoon satellite overpass time has spatially more coherent negative biases (e.g., -8 % over the GL) at coarser resolutions in July, which reversed the positive biases of surface NOx over the SS. The reduced NOx aloft (> 1 km altitude) at coarser resolutions was attributable to the enhanced HOx that intrudes into the upper troposphere. Application of coarse-resolution simulations for interpreting satellite NO(2 )columns will generally underestimate surface NO2 over the GL and overestimate surface NO2 over the SS in summer, but it will uniformly overestimate NOx emissions over both regions. This study significantly broadens understanding of factors contributing to NO(x )resolution effects and the role of fine-resolution data in accurately simulating and interpreting NOx and its relevance to air quality.					; Li, Chi/AAN-2266-2021; Cohen, Ronald/A-8842-2011; Cohen, Ronald Carl/A-8842-2011; Martin, Randall/C-1205-2014; Lin, Jintai/A-8872-2012	Bindle, Liam/0000-0002-6227-0589; Li, Chi/0000-0002-8992-7026; Cohen, Ronald Carl/0000-0001-6617-7691; Martin, Randall/0000-0003-2632-8402; Chatterjee, Deepangsu/0000-0001-7542-9926; Lin, Jintai/0000-0002-2362-2940; Zhang, Dandan/0000-0003-3534-7007; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				MAR 7	2023	23	5					3031	3049		10.5194/acp-23-3031-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3031-2023													WOS:000945914500001

The suitability of the in situ measurement protocol to provide an accurate reference for the simultaneous airborne SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data products over different land cover types was analysed in the context of spatial scale, sample spacing, and uncertainty. The analysis was executed by applying autocorrelation analysis and root mean square difference (RMSD) error estimations. The results showed overall higher variability for all the three bulk snow parameters over tundra, open bogs and lakes (due to wind processes); however, snow depth tended to vary over shorter distances in forests (due to snow-vegetation interactions). Sample spacing/sample size had a statistically significant effect on the mean snow depth over all land cover types. Analysis executed for 50, 100, and 200m transects revealed that in most cases less than five samples were adequate to describe the snow depth mean with RMSD<5 %, but for land cover with high overall variability an indication of increased sample size of 1.5-3 times larger was gained depending on the scale and the desired maximum RMSD. Errors for most of the land cover types reached similar to 10% if only three measurements were considered. The collected measurements, which are available via the ESA website upon registration, compose an exceptionally large manually collected snow data set in Scandinavian taiga and tundra environments. This information represents a valuable contribution to the snow research community and can be applied to various snow studies.

The flash lidars incorporate pioneering 3-D imaging cameras based on Indium-Gallium-Arsenide Avalanche Photo Diode (InGaAs APD) and novel micro-electronic technology for a 128 x 128 pixel array operating at 30 Hz, high pulse-energy 1.06 mu m Nd:YAG lasers, and high performance transmitter and receiver fixed and zoom optics. The two flash lidars are characterized on the NASA-Langley Research Center (LaRC) Sensor Test Range, integrated with other portions of the ALHAT GN&C system from partner organizations into an instrument pod at NASA-JPL, integrated onto an Erickson Aircrane Helicopter at NASA-Dryden, and flight tested at the Edwards AFB Rogers dry lakebed over a field of human-made geometric hazards during the summer of 2010. Results show that the maximum operational range goal of 1 km is met and exceeded up to a value of 1.2 km. In addition, calibrated 3-D images of several hazards are acquired in real-time for later reconstruction into Digital Elevation Maps (DEM's).						, Farzin/0009-0008-5346-5609													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9522-8				2013	8731								87310H	10.1117/12.2015961	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2015961													WOS:000323324800015

This process not only efficiently removed TBP but also facilitated the removal of background organic compounds. The treatment efficiency increased with increased S(iv) addition time. The results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the in situ generated flocs in the Fe(iii)/S(iv) system exhibited enhanced specific surface area, adsorption capacity, and coagulation properties compared to those produced in single Fe(iii) coagulation, with the generation of more Fe3O4 particles. The treatment efficiencies of TBP and background organic materials initially rose and then fell with an increase in the S(iv) dosage. A moderately increasing Fe(iii) dosage also boosted the removal of TBP and background organic substances, whereas an excessive Fe(iii) dosage provided limited additional benefits. In the selected pH range of 3-8, good removal of turbidity could be always achieved, and the best removal of TBP and background organic substances was found at pH 4. Overall, this study indicated that the Fe(iii)/S(iv) system with the combined pre-oxidation and coagulation process would be an effective treatment strategy for aquatic organic micropollutants.					cheng, yujie/LCL-2671-2024; 谢, 鹏超/M-5772-2013														2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 26	2024	10	10					2442	2452		10.1039/d4ew00368c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d4ew00368c		JUL 2024											WOS:001279561100001

Three environmental sequences clustered with Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanobacterium formicicum, six were closely related but not identical to those of strains of Methanosaeta concilii, two grouped with members of the genus Methanosarcina, and two were related to the methanogenic endosymbiont of Plagiopyla nasuta. The cultivation approach via most-probable-number counts with a subsample of the same soil as an inoculum yielded cell numbers of up to 10(7) per g of dry soil for the H-2-CO2-utilizing methanogens and of up to 10(6) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens, Strain VeH52, isolated from the terminal positive dilution on H-2-CO2, grouped within the phylogenetic radiation characterized by M. bryantii and M. formicicum and the environmental sequences of the Methanobacterium-like group. A consortium of two distinct methanogens grew in the terminal positive culture on acetate. These two organisms showed absolute 16S rRNA gene identities with environmental sequences of the novel Methanosaeta-like group and the Methanobacterium-like group. Methanosarcina spp, were identified only in the less-dilute levels of the same dilution series on acetate, These data correlate well with acetate concentrations of about 11 mu M in the pore water of this rice paddy soil, These concentrations are too low for the growth of known Methanosarcina spp, but are at the acetate utilization threshold of Methanosaeta spp, Thus, our data indicated Methanosaeta spp, and Methanobacterium spp, to be the dominant methanogenic groups in the anoxic rice soil, whereas Methanosarcina spp, appeared to be less abundant.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	1998	64	3					960	969																WOS:000072292700023

On this coast, sediment samples were collected on the El Kebir wadi bed, and on beach and dune zones. Grain-size analyses were performed by Laser Diffraction. Also, a morphoscopy analysis of selected quartz grains was conducted with a binocular magnifying glass, while the surface textures of quartz grains were observed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an EDAX microprobe. Granulometric data indicate a decrease in sediment size from upstream (M-z < 1 phi) to downstream of the wadi (M-z > 1 phi) and a high-to-moderate transport medium energy conditions. The beach sands are medium to coarse, moderately to well sorted, and primarily fall into the mesokurtic to leptokurtic ranges, revealing high-energy pulsating conditions in shallow marine water. Current dune sands are generally medium-grained, moderately to well sorted, negatively asymmetric, and mesokurtic to very leptokurtic range. Old dune sands, instead, are fine to very fine with a diameter of 2-4 phi. SEM observations show different types of grain surface microtextures relative to their depositional environments. Those distinguished related to fluvial, marine, and aeolian agents of depositional environments. According to the path of sediment transport, the grains are mostly angular and sub-angular in the wadi bed, rounded and sub-rounded along the beach, and rounded in the dune field. The beach sands were relatively coarser than those of the upper beach and old dunes.

J	Wang, H; Li, Q; Xu, J				Wang, Huan; Li, Qi; Xu, Jun			Climate Warming Does Not Override Eutrophication, but Facilitates Nutrient Release from Sediment and Motivates Eutrophic Process	MICROORGANISMS												The climate is changing. The average temperature in Wuhan, China, is forecast to increase by at least 4.5 degrees C over the next century. Shallow lakes are important components of the biosphere, but they are sensitive to climate change and nutrient pollution. We hypothesized that nutrient concentration is the key determinant of nutrient fluxes at the water-sediment interface, and that increased temperature increases nutrient movement to the water column because warming stimulates shifts in microbial composition and function. Here, twenty-four mesocosms, mimicking shallow lake ecosystems, were used to study the effects of warming by 4.5 degrees C above ambient temperature at two levels of nutrients relevant to current degrees of lake eutrophication levels. This study lasted for 7 months (April-October) under conditions of near-natural light. Intact sediments from two different trophic lakes (hypertrophic and mesotrophic) were used, separately. Environmental factors and bacterial community compositions of overlying water and sediment were measured at monthly intervals (including nutrient fluxes, chlorophyll a [chl a], water conductivity, pH, sediment characteristics, and sediment-water et al.). In low nutrient treatment, warming significantly increased chl a in the overlying waters and bottom water conductivity, it also drives a shift in microbial functional composition towards more conducive sediment carbon and nitrogen emissions. In addition, summer warming significantly accelerates the release of inorganic nutrients from the sediment, to which microorganisms make an important contribution. In high nutrient treatment, by contrast, the chl a was significantly decreased by warming, and the nutrient fluxes of sediment were significantly enhanced, warming had considerably smaller effects on benthic nutrient fluxes. Our results suggest that the process of eutrophication could be significantly accelerated in current projections of global warming, especially in shallow unstratified clear-water lakes dominated by macrophytes.																				2076-2607				APR	2023	11	4							910	10.3390/microorganisms11040910	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11040910								37110333					WOS:000977845000001

We used x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis first to detect volcanic tephra material, followed by electron microprobe analysis to identify the tephra as Mazama ash (7682-7584 cal yr BP) in three sediment cores from the Lake Bonneville basin. We compare these records from varying environmental settings to evaluate tephra presence in the mid-Holocene. We suggest the preservation of tephras such as Mazama ash is tied to the environmental conditions in which they are deposited. Environments with standing water such as lakes or stable wetland springs are more likely to preserve identifiable ash material, while settings susceptible to alternating wet and dry conditions may retain only a trace elemental signature of a tephra due to physical erosion. We propose the development of tephra indices based on unique geochemistry is a useful tool for detection and identification of tephra material in sedimentary records. Here, we develop a Mazama Tephra Index (MTI), specific to Mazama ash in Lake Bonneville basin sediments: MTI = (Y + Zr + Nb)/Rb. We tested the applicability of the MTI and were successful in XRF detection of Mazama ash in all three records.

The areas of destination planned to be developed are: Borobudur Temple in West Java, Mandalika in Lombok Island, Labuan Bajo in Flores Island East Nusa Tenggara, Bromo-Tengger-Semeru in East Java, the Thousand Islands in North Jakarta, Toba Lake in North Sumatra, Wakatobi in Southeast Sulwesi, Tanjung Lesung in West Java, Morotai in North of Halmahera in maluku Islands ans Tanjung Kelayang in Belitung Sumatra. This initiation is a summer breeze for some reasons knowing that Indonesia is opening so many alternative chennels for economic development towards tourism. However, the concept of "ten New Bali", if it is reffered to the actual condition of what Bali is currently suffering from at the momemt, is a wake-up call for all participating social, economy and environmental investigators to fully navigate the projects from being staked out from a pull toursim destination's perpective. The study is intended to examine and elaborate strategic answers towards the impacts on the enforcement of Indonesia' tourism establishment particularly the aftermath likelihoods from the initiations of "Ten New Bali", starting with the issue of locals'economic growth and leakages within their participation in tourism development, and environmental quality's degradation.

J	Heatherly, T; Whiles, MR; Knuth, D; Garvey, JE				Heatherly, T; Whiles, MR; Knuth, D; Garvey, JE			Diversity and community structure of littoral zone macroinvertebrates in southern Illinois reclaimed surface mine lakes	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Surface mine lakes are common in parts of the Midwest, but little is known about the communities that inhabit them or the factors shaping them. Our objectives were to: (1) characterize littoral zone macroinvertebrate communities in surface mine lakes; (2) identify factors that influence macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure; and (3) examine the utility of some commonly used bioassessment metrics to assess habitat quality based on macroinvertebrates. Fourteen lakes on a 1133 ha parcel in southern Illinois were sampled in spring 2003 using a dip net that was swept over two (small lakes) or three (large lakes) littoral zone transects. Three hundred macroinvertebrates were randomly removed from each sample and identified. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to examine relationships between several physicochemical and biological variables and macroinvertebrates. Oligochaetes were typically the most abundant taxon, followed by Hyalella, Chironomidae, Physella and Caenis. Seventy percent of the macroinvertebrates collected from the lakes were predators, while collector-gatherers and scrapers constituted 20% and 9%, respectively. Macroinvertebrate richness was positively related to sunfish abundance and macrophyte cover (R-2 = 0.91, P = 0.001). Simpson diversity was positively related to lake area, percent rock and gravel substrates and simazine concentration and negatively related to bank slope and transparency (R-2 = 0.92, P = 0.0003). Richness and diversity metrics, % Oligochaeta, % Chironomidae, % insect taxa and % dominance varied across lakes, while a Hilsenhoff index and the EPT index appeared less useful for biological assessments in these habitats. Results indicate that macroinvertebrate communities in these lakes are typical of littoral habitats in other lentic systems and that macroinvertebrate diversity might be enhanced during creation and management of these systems by manipulating coarse mineral substrates and vegetation.

Seeking sunlight: rapid phototactic motility of filamentous mat-forming cyanobacteria optimize photosynthesis and enhance carbon burial in Lake Huron's submerged sinkholes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												We studied the motility of filamentous mat-forming cyanobacteria consisting primarily of Oscillatoria-like cells growing under low-light, low-oxygen, and high-sulfur conditions in Lake Huron's submerged sinkholes using in situ observations, in vitro measurements and time-lapse microscopy. Gliding movement of the cyanobacterial trichomes (100-10,000 mu m long filaments, composed of cells similar to 10 mu m wide and similar to 3 mu m tall) revealed individual as well as group-coordinated motility. When placed in a petri dish and dispersed in ground water from the sinkhole, filaments re-aggregated into defined colonies within minutes, then dispersed again. Speed of individual filaments increased with temperature from similar to 50 mu m min(-1) or similar to 5 body lengths min(-1) at 10 degrees C to similar to 215 mu m min(-1) or similar to 70 body lengths min(-1) at 35 degrees C - rates that are rapid relative to non-flagellated/ciliated microbes. Filaments exhibited precise and coordinated positive phototaxis toward pinpoints of light and congregated under the light of foil cutouts. Such light-responsive clusters showed an increase in photosynthetic yield - suggesting phototactic motility aids in light acquisition as well as photosynthesis. Once light source was removed, filaments slowly spread out evenly and re-aggregated, demonstrating coordinated movement through inter-filament communication regardless of light. Pebbles and pieces of broken shells placed upon intact mat were quickly covered by vertically motile filaments within hours and became fully buried in the anoxic sediments over 3-4 diurnal cycles - likely facilitating the preservation of falling debris. Coordinated horizontal and vertical filament motility optimize mat cohesion and dynamics, photosynthetic efficiency and sedimentary carbon burial in modern-day sinkhole habitats that resemble the shallow seas in Earth's early history. Analogous cyanobacterial motility may have played a key role in the oxygenation of the planet by optimizing photosynthesis while favoring carbon burial.

Water column, sediment, and pore water concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (mg), as well as related aquatic chemical parameters were examined. Inorganic Hg(II)-methylation rates were determined in selected water column and sediment subsamples spiked with inorganic divalent mercury (Hg-204(II)). Net production of (MeHg)-Hg-204 was expressed as apparent first-order rate constants for methylation (k(meth)), which were also expanded to MeHg production potential (MPP) rates via combination with tin reducible 'reactive' Hg(II) (Hg(II)(R)) as a proxy for bioavailable Hg(II). Notable findings include: 1) elevated Hg concentrations previously reported in birds and brine flies were spatially proximal to the measured highest MeHg concentrations, the latter occurring in the anoxic deep brine layer (DBL) of the Great Salt Lake; 2) timing of reduced Hg(II)-methylation rates in the DBL (according to both k(meth), and MPP) coincides with reduced Hg burdens among aquatic invertebrates (brine shrimp and brine flies) that act as potential vectors of Hg propagation to the terrestrial ecosystem; 3) values of k(meth) were found to fall within the range reported by other studies; and 4) MPP rates were on the lower end of the range reported in methodologically comparable studies, suggesting the possibility that elevated MeHg in the anoxic deep brine layer results from its accumulation and persistence in this quasi-isolated environment, due to the absence of light (restricting abiotic photo demethylation) and/or minimal microbiological demethylation.

Based on the data and previous results of ice thermodynamics and mechanics, the ice-water interface heat flux of 9.06 W/m2 and a bearing capacity attenuation coefficient of 0.072 under long-term ice load were obtained. A new equation including ice thickness, ice temperature, and attenuation time was estimated to evaluate ice bearing capacity in Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reach of Yellow River. Besides, the safety boundary condition of ice thickness for construction at different air temperatures and attenuation times (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, and 120 h) was calculated. Under the condition that the engineering task is not urgent, it was recommended to choose an attenuation time of 120 h. Moreover, it was recommended that the ice thickness for safe construction should be increased by 10% for slightly defective ice cover containing air bubbles, sediment, and small cracks, and by 40% for severely defective ice cover with cracks exceeding 50% of the ice thickness or with water flowing in the cracks. In addition, some measures such as increasing ice thickness and thinning the thickness of gabions and the potential limitations of the ice mechanics equations are analyzed and discussed for future applications.

The land surface parameterization is modified in two primary respects. Firstly, we modify the space dependant bucket depth scheme in the original model to one in which this depth is taken to be constant. Secondly, we modify the evapotranspiration parameterization from the space dependant form employed in the control model to a more conventional space independent scheme. In all, 4 experiments have been performed to enable us to resolve both the modern control and the 6 ka BP response to the land surface modifications. A subset of these simulations is also compared with results obtained using other models in the context of the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP) to investigate the mid-latitude behaviour of these models to reveal the extent to which model response to a change in radiative forcing may be significantly influenced by changes in the land surface parameterization. These comparisons reveal that the original Canadian GCMII model is an extreme outlier among the members of the set of all models in that its Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude surface continental response to the 6 ka BP insolation anomaly is significantly cold biased in the summer season. We investigate the extent to which this anomalous behaviour may be explained as a consequence of modifications to the land surface parameterizations employed in GCMII. Our results reveal a strong sensitivity in the modern control model to changes in bucket depth, but not to the modification of the evapotranspiration scheme. More interesting, however, is the fact that the model climate sensitivity at 6 ka BP is influenced both by changes in bucket depth and by changes in the evapotranspiration scheme. A detailed investigation of the surface energy balance, cloud cover, surface albedo, and snow cover reveals the role of each of the components that contribute to the 6 ka BP surface temperature response. Comparison of the predictions of the CCCma model with proxy climate indicators of lake levels and surface temperature over Canada, furthermore, demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of climate predictions for this geographical region to changes in the manner in which land surface processes are represented.

Lithium brine deposits within the Qaidam basin are predominantly categorized into modern salt lake brines and deep brines. The former are the principal raw materials for the production of lithium salt products in China, whereas the latter are considered vital lithium reserve resources. The origin of lithium in modern salt lake brines is intricately linked to lithium-rich hot springs surfacing from deep, extensive fault zones surrounding the basin. The distribution of lithium-rich salt lakes is mainly governed by the evolution of ancient lake basins, induced by the Neotectonic activities. The formation of deep lithium-rich brines is subject to multiple factors, with water-rock interactions playing a crucial role. An important scientific endeavor for future studies on modern salt lakes in the Qaidam basin and the whole Qinghai-Xizang Plateau region involves a thorough analysis of the geochemical behavior of lithium throughout its migration and enrichment processes to clarify the genetic connections between hard-rock lithium mines and lithium-rich salt lakes.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				AUG	2025	120	5								10.5382/econgeo.5164;23p	http://dx.doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.5164;23p													WOS:001583053900004

Trends in cellulose-inferred lakewater delta(18)O values for both lakes suggest that moist conditions after deglaciation were followed by progressive drying from about 9500 to between 8000 and 7500 C-14 yr BP. Although pine appeared in the area by 8000 C-14 yr BP, the maximum density of trees locally, as suggested by stomate evidence, occurred during subsequent moistening between 7500 and 6000 C-14 yr BP. This is c. 1000 years later than in other regions of northern Russia and is possibly attributable to limitations on seedling establishment and survival due to root desiccation during dry winters. Changes in nutrient balance and productivity in the lakes, as inferred from variations in A sediment carbon and nitrogen elemental abundances and their respective stable-isotope signatures, are also consistent with expected changes in hydrological and edaphic conditions. Development of moister conditions at about 7000 C-14 yr BP on the Kola Peninsula is in harmony with evidence for increased oceanicity at this time in central Siberia, which is thought to reflect enhanced propagation of warm, moist air masses across northern Eurasia due to increased sea-surface temperatures and reduced sea-ice cover in the Nordic Seas.																			0959-6836	1477-0911					2003	13	2					153	160		10.1191/0959683603hl605ft	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl605ft													WOS:000181279000001

In order to assess the past fire hazard and the fire-season length, based on data availability and requirements for fire index computation, we first chose and tested the efficiency of the Drought Code (DC) in Corsica (the main French Mediterranean fire-prone region) over the current period (1979-2016). We then used DC as a benchmark to assess the efficiency of the Monthly Drought Code (MDC) and used it to assess the Fire-Season Length (FSL), which were both used to characterize the fire hazard. Finally, we computed the Holocene MDC and FSL based on the HadCM3B-M1 climate model (three dimensional, fully dynamic, coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model without flux adjustment) datasets and compared both index trends with those from proxies of paleofire, vegetation, and land use retrieved from sedimentary records in three Corsican lakes (Bastani, Nino, and Creno). Our strategy was to (i) assess fire hazard without the constraint of the daily weather-data requirement, (ii) reconstruct Holocene fire hazard from a climate perspective, and (iii) discuss the role of climate and human fire drivers based on the MDC-Paleofire proxy comparisons. Using both the Promethee fire database and the ERA-Interim climate database over Corsica for the current period, we showed that DC values higher than 405 units efficiently discriminated fire-days from no-fire-days. The equivalent threshold value from MDC was set at 300 units. MDC and FSL indexes calculated for each of the past 11 millennia Before Present (11 ka BP) showed high values before 7 ka BP (above 300 units for MDC) and then lower values for the mid- to late Holocene (below 300 units for MDC). Climate appeared as a key driver to predict fire occurrences, promoting fires between 11 and 8 ka BP when summers were warmer than the current ones and reducing fire hazard after 7-6 ka BP due to wetter conditions. Since 5 ka BP, humans have taken control of the fire regime through agro-pastoralism, favoring large and/or frequent events despite less fire-prone climate conditions. The current fire hazard and fire-season length computed over the last few decades (1979-2016) both reported values that were respectively higher and longer than those assessed for the previous six millennia at least and comparable for those before 7 ka BP. For the next decades, due to climate warming associated with land abandonment (fuel accumulation) and the increase in human-related sources of ignition, we can expect an increase in fire hazard and larger fire events.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												Understanding the dynamics between climate change and human adaptive strategies is a longstanding question driving paleoecological and archaeological research in North America's Great Basin. We present multiproxy data from five sediment cores retrieved from Paulina Marsh in the Fort Rock Basin, Oregon, an area renowned for its archaeology but lacking the paleoenvironmental data needed to fully contextualize those records. Radiocarbon, pollen, particle size, elemental, and charcoal analyses of one core, and geochronological data from four additional cores, reveal fluctuating vegetation communities, hydrologic conditions, and fire histories during the Early and Late Holocene that are consistent with models proposed to explain changing settlement-subsistence patterns in the region. There was likely an emergent marsh or meadow and an absence of Juniperus at the core site during the Early Holocene. Middle Holocene deposits are not present due to a geologic unconformity, perhaps because of channel migration and climatic aridity. Late Holocene sediments record a more mesic meandering stream system between similar to 3900 and 2200 years ago, followed by an increase in xeric-adapted vegetation in the last 2000 years. The lack of Juniperus pollen in the Early Holocene sediments inform ongoing debates about Juniperus spread in the Great Basin. These data represent the first Early Holocene pollen record from the Fort Rock Basin and are one of few lowland vegetation histories of this age in the region. This study contributes to our understanding of past ecology in semi-arid environments, provides new context for archaeological interpretations, and establishes a framework for future work in the region.

The present study explored the effect of precipitation, temperature, and the water level of the main river on the quality of oxbows. We assessed the quality of four oxbows in the Upper Tisza region (north Hungary) over a two-year period. Water samples were collected in the summer in 2011 and 2012, and 12 physico-chemical parameters were investigated. We found positive correlations between the dissolved oxygen, water temperature, concentration of hydro carbonate, nitrate, pH, conductivity and the average temperature. Canonical discriminant analysis showed that the studied oxbows were similar in 2011 and 2012, based on physico-chemical parameters. Significant differences were found between the years, in terms of the water temperature, the content of suspended solids, and the concentrations of carbonate and chloride. Our results show that only short-term weather changes such as less precipitation and higher temperature cause the quality of oxbows to deteriorate. Our results demonstrated that the water quality of oxbows is influenced by the River Tisza, because the decrease in the water level of the Tisza was also responsible for the differences between the years, based on the physical-chemical parameters of the water.					; Tóthmérész, Béla/A-5114-2009	Tothmeresz, Bela/0000-0002-4766-7668; 													0324-6329					JUL-SEP	2016	120	3					301	313																WOS:000384536400003

Limited Co- existence of Native Unionids and Invasive Dreissenid Mussels more than 30 Y Post Dreissenid Invasion in a Large River System	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												There are serious concerns for native freshwater mussel survival (Bivalvia: Unionidae) in the Laurentian Great Lakes region after populations were seemingly pushed to the brink of extirpation following the introduction of dreissenid mussels (D.reissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) in the mid-1980s. The Detroit River was the first major river system in North America to be invaded by dreissenids, and unionids were considered extirpated from the river by 1998. Since then several unionid refuges (areas with relatively low dreissenid impact and surviving unionids) have been found in coastal areas of lakes St. Clair and Erie, but no documentation exists in the Detroit River. To assess dreissenid presence and potential unionid persistence, a mixture of stratified random, historical, and potential refuge sites were surveyed during summer 2019 in the Detroit River. Unionid and dreissenid habitat use was further investigated with analysis of variance and classification tree analyses. Of the 56 sites surveyed, only five sites had live unionids totaling 220 animals of 11 species. More than 2000 unionid shells of 31 species were collected from 39 sites, confirming the large and diverse unionid populations that existed prior to the dreissenid invasion. Ninety-eight percent of live unionids found showed evidence of past or present dreissenid attachment. Estimated dreissenid densities were highly variable with river location and ranged from 0 to 5673 live individuals per m(2), with the largest densities concentrated in the upstream half of the Detroit River. Despite their previously assumed extirpation from the Detroit River, live unionids wei found during this comprehensive survey. Although only 40% of the historical species within the unionid assemblage remains, our results suggest, in the right conditions, some co-existence is possible among some species of unionids and dreissenids in this large river system.

However, the role of Bathyarchaeia in arsenic (As) metabolism and their contribution to As mobilization in aquifers remain unclear. In this study, we recovered 15 Bathyarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from metagenomes of borehole sediments in the Jianghan Plain (JHP), China. Together with 374 representative Bathyarchaeia MAGs from public databases, six As metabolism genes i.e. arrA, arsR, arsA, arsB, arsC (Trx) and arsM were identified, accounting for 4.4, 47.6, 20.3, 38.3, 37.5 and 49.4 % of total Bathyarchaeia MAGs, respectively. Heterologous expression of multiple arsC and arsM genes of Bathyarchaeia MAGs obtained from JHP sediments validated their abilities for As(V) reduction and As(III) methylation at environmentally relevant As concentration. These results indicate that in addition to providing bioavailable carbon sources for other microbial functional populations, Bathyarchaeia directly participate in As mobilization in the JHP aquifer via As(V) reduction and As(III) methylation. The diversified distribution of arsC and arsM in the class Bathyarchaeia suggests that Bathyarchaeia may contribute to As cycling in other As-rich environments, such as hot spring, saline lakes, marine hydrothermal sediments and soils.

Individual return patterns of spawning flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) to a desert river tributary	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Tributaries provide temporal and spatial habitat heterogeneity in river networks that can be critical for parts of the life history of a species. Tributary fidelity can benefit individual fish undergoing spawning migrations by reducing time and energy spent exploring new areas and leveraging previous experience, but anthropogenic activities that fragment or degrade these systems can eliminate those benefits. We used multistate models based on passive integrated transponder (PIT) detection data from 2013 to 2023 to estimate the proportion of flannelmouth suckers (Catostomus latipinnis) migrating to a tributary, McElmo Creek, from the mainstem San Juan River for spawning. Survival varied among years and among states. The top model for migration probability included sex, with males slightly more likely to migrate (0.93 vs 0.90), and the next model identified interannual variation in migration probability ranging from 0.875 to 0.999 across years, indicating high site fidelity. Individuals showed consistency in relative arrival timing across years, with the highest correlation generally during years with greater spring discharge and extended tributary residence time. Successful tributary spawning may be important for the maintenance of the mainstem San Juan River flannelmouth sucker population, but site fidelity may be maladaptive where tributaries are vulnerable to human alterations.

Round gobies are an important part of VHSV genotype IVb ecology in the St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Although viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is known to affect at least 28 species of Great Lakes fish, round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) appear to be particularly affected. The first report of VHSV in New York State waters occurred in round gobies and in subsequent surveillance efforts a disproportionately high proportion of round gobies were infected with VHSV compared with other species tested. In this study, we tested the experimental susceptibility of round gobies to infection with VHSV in the laboratory, using naive and previously exposed fish. Naive fish were significantly more susceptible than previously exposed fish, however previously exposed fish experienced a mortality of 35% over 45 days suggesting that previous exposure did not result in complete protection. Field studies at two sites showed a significant change in prevalence over 10 weeks in the spring based on non-lethal fin and gill samples, suggesting that great care must be taken when interpreting prevalence from single sampling efforts during VHSV surveillance. There was no difference in the observed diversity of sequence types of virus from fish that tested positive during times of low or high prevalence, or during a confinement-induced laboratory epidemic. These results show that round gobies are experimentally susceptible to VHSV and that the field prevalence of VHSV in this species can vary greatly within a short period of time; these results also provide a preliminary exploration of the role round gobies may be playing in the dynamics of VHSV in the eastern Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.

J	Xu, LMM; Holmberg, K; Magner, J				Xu, Limeimei; Holmberg, Kerry; Magner, Joe			The Evaluation of a Novel Denitrifying Woodchip Bioreactor: Fairmont, MN, USA	NITROGEN												The risk of nitrate contamination became a reality for Fairmont in Minnesota, when water rich in NO3-N exceeded the drinking water standard of 10 mg/L. This was unexpected because this city draws its municipal water from a chain of lakes that are fed primarily by shallow groundwater under row-crop land use. Spring soil thaw drives cold water into a subsurface pipe where almost no NO3-N reduction occurs. This paper focuses on NO3-N reduction before the water enters the lakes and no other nitrogen management practices in the watershed. A novel denitrifying bioreactor was constructed behind a sediment forebay, which then flowed into a chamber covered by a greenhouse before entering a woodchip bioreactor. In 2022 and 2023, water depth, dissolved oxygen, and temperature were measured at several locations in the bioreactor, and continuous NO3-N was measured at the entry and exit of the bioreactor. The results showed better performance at a low water depth with lower dissolved oxygen and higher water temperature. The greenhouse raised the inlet temperature in 2022 but did not in 2023. The forebay and the greenhouse may have impeded the denitrification process due to the high dissolved oxygen concentrations in the influent and the stratification of dissolved oxygen caused by algae in the bioreactor.

J	Drzymulska, D				Drzymulska, Danuta			Mosses recognized as glacial relicts from their postglacial distribution in Poland	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Some glacial relict (mosses) have survived from the Ice Age up to the present time in specific, long-lasting habitats. Mires are one of the most common ecosystems in which they are present. In this paper the past distribution of eight species of such peat-forming mosses in Poland in the past is discussed. The distribution and dates of previously published moss finds in Poland have been mapped. In almost every case the largest number of places where they were found was in northern, or more precisely northeast Poland. A significant difference in the number of known find sites for individual species and many sites of unknown age were found. The rarest moss was definitely Cinclidium stygium and the most frequent was Meesia triquetra. Data on the distribution of mosses in the Late Glacial and Holocene proved to be scarcer than expected. Only a few sites were found where the occurrence of species such as Meesia triquetra, Calliergon giganteum, Tomentypnum nitens, Pseudocalliergon trifarium, Helodium blandowii and Scorpidium scorpioides was fairly continuous for this period. Therefore, the status of these mosses as glacial relicts seems to merit some thought. Certainly, there is a further need for high resolution research on bryophyte macrofossils, combined with accurate dating.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				SEP	2024	33	5					657	669		10.1007/s00334-023-00983-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-023-00983-5		JAN 2024											WOS:001135572100001

Diatom types of REM Archibald from Lake Sibaya and Lake Nhlange, South Africa	DIATOM RESEARCH												Natural lakes are rarely found in South Africa and are usually restricted to coastal regions. One of the larger coastal lakes is Lake Sibaya, which is situated in North-Eastern Kwa-Zulu Natal, a subtropical summer rainfall region. In 1966 a survey of this and other smaller lakes connected to the Lake Sibaya system was conducted and diatom samples were collected, of which three were examined by R.E.M. Archibald, and from which nine new species were described. Archibald illustrated these new taxa using line drawings; the interpretation of such illustrations for species identification is sometimes difficult. For this reason we have re-examined the type material with the aim of producing light microscope (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of the species in question. All nine taxa described and illustrated by Archibald were found again in the type slides and photographed from the holotype slides using LM. Unfortunately the preserved type material was stored in un-buffered formalin and had degraded to a point where it could no longer be used for SEM. Additional desiccated samples collected during later expeditions between 1966 and 1972 were selected, based on similarity of locality and substratum, and used to obtain SEM micrographs. Again, all taxa could be documented from material in these additional samples. Of the nine taxa described, we transferred four to more appropriate genera, as they were originally described as species of Achnanthes and Navicula. Although Archibald's line drawings were detailed and accurate, it was necessary to document these types using LM and SEM in order to make accurate designations at generic level and to facilitate identification of these taxa if found in other localities.

Population Demographics of Sauger and Simulated Effects of Minimum Length Limits in the Kaskaskia and Ohio Rivers	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Sauger Sander canadensis are a popular sport fish native to large turbid midwestern rivers and are in decline across much of their range due to habitat loss and exploitation. Specifically, within the lower Kaskaskia and Ohio rivers, Sauger are managed under different harvest regulations and a knowledge gap exists regarding the current status of both populations as well as the effects of the harvest regulations on the size and age structures of both populations. We collected Sauger by nighttime boat electrofishing during early winter 2014-2016 and used otoliths to age all fish. Sauger stocks in both rivers exhibited fast growth rates and high annual mortality rates. Yield-per-recruit modeling indicated that the current 356-mm minimum size limit for Sauger in the Kaskaskia River is sufficient to prevent growth overfishing and likely explains the consistently larger size structure (greater proportion of fish >= 356-mm total length) of Sauger sampled from the Kaskaskia River compared with the Ohio River. Modeling suggested that growth and recruitment overfishing of Sauger are likely occurring in the Ohio River with no minimum length limit based on available exploitation estimates for Sauger in the lower Ohio River. Implementing a 356-mm minimum length limit for Sauger in the lower Ohio River is predicted to prevent growth and recruitment overfishing based on available exploitation rate estimates and would be consistent with the statewide minimum length limit for Sauger in Illinois and minimum length limits on two major tributaries (Tennessee and Cumberland rivers downstream of Kentucky and Barkley lakes, respectively).

Additionally, an similar to 8 m sediment core from a glacial lake was investigated to provide independent radiocarbon age control. The oldest and most extensive glaciation occurred >= 116.3 ka and likely coincides with the lake transgression phase Ouki on the Altiplano. Maximum glaciation in phase with the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is dated to 22-25 ka and documents a glacial mass-balance response to substantially lower temperatures and minor precipitation increase in phase with the Sajsi lake transgression phase. After initial deglaciation and formation of a small paleolake at Tres Lagunas, a glacial readvance is documented by an outwash diamict in the sediment core and radiocarbon dated to 19-17 ka, as well as by a moraine surface exposure dated to similar to 17 ka. The most prominent moraine was deposited at >= 14.5 ka coinciding with the lake transgression phase Tauca on the Altiplano. This Late Glacial advance reflects the massive intensification of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) in response to northern hemispheric cooling during Heinrich I and the resultant southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and La Nina like conditions in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Rapid deglaciation started after similar to 14.5 ka, interrupted only by minor glacial still stands at similar to 13.8 +/- 1.5 ka and 12.0 +/- 1.5 ka, the latter one correlating with the Coipasa transgression phase on the Altiplano and the Younger Dryas.

J	Custer, CM; Custer, TW				Custer, CM; Custer, TW			Organochlorine and trace element contamination, in wintering and migrating diving ducks in the southern Great Lakes, USA, since the zebra mussel invasion	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Because of the potential for increased trophic transfer of contaminants by zebra mussels (Dreissena sp.) to higher trophic levels, we collected four species of waterfowl (n = 65 ducks) from four locations in Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Michigan, USA, between 1991 and 1993 for organochlorine contaminant and trace element analyses. Geometric mean concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were 1.35 and 0.15 mug/g wet weight in lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) carcasses and were below known effect levels. Total PCBs in 80% of carcasses, however, were above the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's threshold of 3.0 mug/g lipid weight for consumption of poultry. With the exception of selenium; trace elements were also at background or no-effect levels. Selenium concentrations in livers of 95% of lesser scaup, 90% of bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and 72% of common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) were in the elevated (>10 mug/g dry wt) or potentially harmful range (>33 mug/g dry wt). The effects of these high,selenium concentrations are unknown but should be investigated further based on reproductive effects observed in field and laboratory studies of dabbling ducks and because lesser scaup populations are declining. Concentrations of total PCBs in dreissenid mussels in western Lake Erie were 10 times higher than in the upper Mississippi River but were similar to concentrations in other industrialized rivers in Europe and the United States. Metal concentrations were similar to other industrialized sites where zebra mussels have been sampled.

The fluvial sequences are composed of fining upward cycles with successive occurrence of planar crossbedded sandstone facies displaying unimodal paleocurrent system and rare mudstone facies typical of braided river system. The deltaic succession consists of both fining and coarsening upwards cycles with the former depicting fluvial setting of an upper delta plain while the later suggestive of mouth bar sequences. The setting displays a polymodal current system of fluvial, waves, storms and tides that were primarily induced by complex interactions of seiches and lunar tides. Similar current systems devoid of fluvial patterns were reflected in the coarsening upward packages of the shoreface sequences. Lacustrine succession composed of thick bioturbated mudstone facies generally defines the base of these coarsening upward profiles, giving a fluvio-lacustrine geomorphic relief where complex interaction developed the deltaic and shoreface facies along its shorelines. Clay mineral fractions of the formation are dominantly kaolinitic, indicating a predominantly humid tropical-subtropical climatic condition during their deposition. This climatic regime falls within the African humid period of the early - mid Holocene that led to the third lacustrine transgression of the Lake Mega-Chad, whereas the subordinate smectite mineralization points to aridification that characterizes most of the post humid period to recent.

Determining iron availability to cyanobacteria is therefore essential for timely warnings of bloom development. The objectives of this study were to determine the key spectral parameters indicating cellular iron status in cyanobacteria and to establish reliable equations for estimating iron nutrition in cyanobacterial cells. Cells, pigments, cellular iron, and spectra of cyanobacteria were measured monthly at 17 sites in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake during the summer period of cyanobacterial blooms from 2010 to 2013. Pronounced spatial and temporal variability of cellular iron of cyanobacteria was observed. The previously developed structure-insensitive pigment index (SIPI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) and the newly proposed chlorophyll alpha/phycocyanin inclthc (R-Chl/PC) exhibited strong relationships with cyanobacterial cellular iron content. The relationships between the cellular iron concentration and SIPI, PSRI and R-Chl/PC could be expressed as linear, quadratic and cubic functions, respectively. The equations derived herein were tested using independent data from 2008 to 2009, obtained from 31 sites within Taihu Lake. For the three models that included SIPI, PSRI and R-Chl/PC as predictors, the coefficients of determination (R-2) between the measured and estimated cellular iron concentration were 0.549, 0.584 and 0.909, and the mean relative errors (RE) were 17.1%, 18.1% and 8.0%, respectively. The overall results indicated that use of the three key hyperspectral parameters, SIPI, PSRI and R-Chl/PC, could be used for non-destructive and real-time monitoring of the iron nutritional status of cyanobacteria-dominant algal blooms in eutrophic lakes.

Therefore, it affects global biogeochemical processes which in turn affect the global climate by absorbing and reflecting solar radiation, and by altering fluxes of heat, water vapour, carbon dioxide and other trace gases through various feedback mechanisms. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how Earth's critical zone processes have changed over time and their link with past monsoon variability, especially in Asia. The study of lake sediments, which contain a suite of inorganic elemental and isotopic proxies, may facilitate the understanding of the Earth's critical zone processes on millennial timescales. Here we reconstruct the history of erosion-weathering-vegetation interactions since similar to 14.7 ka using geochemical records from a radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Lake Gonghai in the monsoon-arid transitional zone of north China. Detrital (Al, Ti, K, Rb) and authigenic (Ca, Sr) elemental records reveal distinct, millennial-scale, late deglacial-Holocene erosion and weathering patterns and transitions with the former (latter) elements showing higher (lower) values in warm intervals and vice versa. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) molar, a humidity proxy, suggests low humidity during the late deglacial similar to 11.5-14.7 ka, high humidity during the early-mid Holocene similar to 11.5-3.2 ka, and intermediate humidity during the late Holocene interval since similar to 3.2 ka. The results of cross-spectral analysis and comparison of our records with other climate reconstructions also suggest a pattern of orbitally-phased humidity changes in north China. Overall, our results provide evidence for the solar-forcing of Earth's surface processes in mid-latitude China under natural climatic conditions. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although planktonic microbial community plays an important role in river biogeochemical cycles, few studies have attempted to address the characteristics of AOA and AOB in the water column of river ecosystems. This study examined the community structures, distributions and abundance of planktonic AOA and AOB in the Dongjiang River and their responses to the changes in environmental parameters through quantitative polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing of ammonia mono-oxygenase (amoA). The abundance ratio of AOB to AOA varied from 0.07 to 9.4 along the river and was positively correlated with the concentration of ammonium. Significantly positive correlations were observed between the abundance of AOB and potential nitrification rates, which suggested that the contribution of AOB to nitrification was greater than that of AOA in the river. Phylogenetic analyses showed that AOA communities could be divided into three branches of Thaumarchaeota: Group 1.1a, Group 1.1a associated and Group 1.1b, with most sequences belonging to Group 1.1a. All AOB sequences fell within Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira species, and the majority of sequences were affiliated with the latter. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that the community distributions of AOA and AOB were significantly correlated with the concentrations of nitrate and total suspended solids, respectively. These findings fundamentally improved our understanding of the role of planktonic AOA and AOB in nitrogen cycling and their responses to changes in environmental factors in the river ecosystem.

J	OLDFIELD, F				OLDFIELD, F			TOWARD THE DISCRIMINATION OF FINE-GRAINED FERRIMAGNETS BY MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS IN LAKE AND NEAR-SHORE MARINE-SEDIMENTS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The magnetic properties of low field susceptibility (chi), frequency dependent susceptibility (chi(fd)), and susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (chi(ARM)) are used to define sets of natural soil and sediment samples within which, by the criteria of King et al. (1982) and Maher (1988), the modal ferrimagnetic grain diameter is less than approximately 0.07 - 0.1 mum. Within this sample set, two distinct groups with low and high values, respectively, for the quotients chi(ARM)/chi and chi(arm)/chifd are defined. The first group includes sediment samples from sites where published studies propose a detrital origin for the fine-grained ferrimagnetic content, Where catchment samples are available for comparison, they fall within the same envelope, as do clays from palaeosol samples within Chinese loess. This envelope of low quotient values also overlaps with the values for the fine grained synthetic magnetite samples within Maher's (1988) New MT series. The high quotient envelope of values includes sediments from the Adriatic Sea and clays from saltmarsh and shallow water marine sediments in NW Britain. In these cases, no catchment source is postulated for the fine-grained magnetite. The size range of magnetite in this set appears to be almost exclusively stable single domain (SSD), and a bacterial origin seems likely. Sample sets from estuarine environments between river inflow sites and the open sea show intermediate values which, in the case of the Potomac, are ordered by distance down river. Although at this stage, magnetic measurements alone cannot discriminate between bacterial and fine-grained detrital ferrimagnets in sediments, they hold out some promise of doing so provided the distinctions proposed here can be substantiated by transmission electron microscopy.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				MAY 10	1994	99	B5					9045	9050		10.1029/93JB03137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JB03137													WOS:A1994NL92000004

The parasite was not observed in three neighbouring lakes. Infection was first observed about 1 month after hatching of roach larvae, simultaneously with the spring increase in water temperature. Within 2 weeks the parasite had spread to almost all roach larvae observed. In the beginning of July, the abundance of roach larvae in the lake declined dramatically. L multifiliis was not observed on 0+ of rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), bream (Abramis brama) or perch (Perca fluviatilis), even though these species were numerous in the same habitats as roach. The importance of I. multifiliis as a factor in roach mortality was examined experimentally by comparing the mortality of uninfected and artificially infected roach during a laboratory epidemic, and by comparing the mortality of uninfected and naturally infected roach under laboratory conditions. Both the naturally infected roach larvae and the roach larvae artificially exposed to I. multifiliis died within a few days and before uninfected roach. The shift in juvenile roach distribution to a more permanent littoral habitat induced by pike-perch introduction is suggested as an important cause of I. multifiliis epidemics, since the encystment of the free-living stage needs a substrate. In addition, the high roach fry abundance and high temperature in shallow waters will promote optimal conditions for outbreak of the infection.																			0165-7836					JUN	1994	20	1					49	61		10.1016/0165-7836(94)90005-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)90005-1													WOS:A1994NT21600004
J	DRAKE, H; BURROWS, CJ				DRAKE, H; BURROWS, CJ			THE INFLUX OF POTENTIAL MACROFOSSILS INTO LADY LAKE, NORTH WESTLAND, NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The influx of plant litter to a lake surrounded by forest and swamp vegetation, in Westland, was studied. The relative abundance of plant species in the vegetation was studied by sampling 3 sites adjacent to the sample sites for lake litter. With the exception of ground species and epiphytes there is a good qualitative representation of the forest vegetation composition in the lake litter, and for most of the very common taxa in the forests there is a good quantitative representation also. There are some discrepancies, where taxa are better represented, or less-well represented than their abundance in the vegetation would suggest. The outstanding instance of this is the very poor representation of swamp monocotyledons and aquatic plants in the lake litter. This is attributed partly to poor preservation of foliage, and partly to over-abundance of leaf and twig detritus from trees and shrubs. Seeds are not as common in the lake litter as expected and this may be due to the dilution effect and/or the sifting effect of abundant coarse leaf and twig detritus. Several different modes of entry of plant litter to the lake can be inferred, of which stream transport, direct fall and wind-carriage seem to be the most important. Some aspects of sedimentation can also be inferred. Much more detailed study is needed before the quantitative relationships between populations of plants in the vegetation and the influx of litter to the lake are properly understood.																			0028-825X	1175-8643					1980	18	2					257	274		10.1080/0028825X.1980.10426924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.1980.10426924													WOS:A1980KC39200012

Investigation of mercury wet deposition physicochemistry in the Ohio River Valley through automated sequential sampling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Intra-storm variability and soluble fractionation was explored for summer-time rain events in Steubenville, Ohio to evaluate the physical processes controlling mercury (Hg) in wet deposition in this industrialized region. Comprehensive precipitation sample collection was conducted from July through September 2006 using three different methods to evaluate both soluble and insoluble fractions as well as scavenging and washout properties of Hg and a suite of trace elements. Real-time filtration of event total precipitation revealed that 61 +/- 17% (mean +/- standard deviation) of Hg in wet deposition was in a soluble form. Comparison of total and dissolved element concentrations (solubility fractionation) showed the following order of decreasing solubility: S > Na > Se > Ca > Mg > Hg > As > Mn > V > Cr > Fe > La approximate to Ce ranging from 95% (5) to 4% (Ce). To examine removal mechanisms occurring during the course of a precipitation event, discrete, sequential sub-event precipitation samples were collected. Results indicated that Hg had lower "scavenging coefficients" (the rate of Hg concentration decrease throughout the events) than the majority of elements analyzed, indicating that either (i) Hg is incorporated into rain via gas phase inclusion or particulate nucleation within cloud, or (ii) Hg is available in the boundary layer for scavenging, even in the latter stages of precipitation. The Hg scavenging coefficient (-0.39) was low compared to S (-0.73), a co-pollutant of Hg. When compared to an upwind, regionally representative site, the scavenging coefficient of Hg for the locally influenced precipitation was 25% lower. This observation suggests that a continuous feed of soluble Hg was the reason for the low scavenging coefficient. Overall, this investigation of Hg wet deposition in Steubenville indicates that the physical and chemical properties of Hg emissions are driving the elevated deposition rates observed near point sources.

To do so, we used large lake databases that collect photochemically significant parameters such as water depth and dissolved organic carbon, which allow for a preliminary assessment of some photoreactions. Extension to other photoreactions is currently prevented by the lack of important parameters such as water absorption spectrum, suspended solids, nitrate, nitrite, pH, and inorganic carbon on a global scale. It appears that triplet-sensitized CLO photodegradation would be strongly affected by the dissolved organic carbon values of the lake water and, for this reason, it would be fastest in Nordic environments. By contrast, direct photolysis (DIC) would be highly affected by sunlight irradiance and would proceed at the highest rates in the tropical belt. Interestingly, the predicted lifetimes of CLO and DIC are shorter than the residence time of water in the majority of global lake basins, which suggests a high potential for photoreactions to attenuate the two contaminants on a global scale. Photodegradation of DIC and CLO would also be important in waste stabilization ponds, except for elevated latitudes during winter, which makes these basins potentially cost-effective systems for the partial removal of these emerging contaminants from wastewater.

J	Schmidt-Neto, H				Schmidt-Neto, Hugo			TAPHOFACIES OF COASTAL LAKES BASED ON MOLLUSK DEATH ASSEMBLAGES: A CASE STUDY OF MIRIM LAKE	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA												Mirim Lake is the second-largest lacustrine body in Brazil, stretching for some 185 km and covering about 375 thousand hectares of water surface. This lake is part of the Patos-Mirim System, one of the world's largest complexes of coastal lagoons, which is the result of the rise and fall of sea level over transgressive-regressive cycles triggered by glacio-eustasy during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Its characteristics and dynamics give it singular importance for studies on the genesis of shell accumulation in lagoons. This study aims to improve the knowledge of how the taphonomic signatures reflect the environmental characteristics and dynamics of Mirim Lake. Categorization of the arrangement and packing of death assemblages, as well as the orientation of shells, supported the biostratinomical approach. The taphonomic signatures included disarticulation, fragmentation, and corrosion of shells. Corrosion is the primary damage observed in the bioclasts, varying from a single loss of color to complete degradation. Differences in the characteristics of death assemblages observed in the dune fields and the lacustrine plain led to the recognition of two taphofacies. A more significant number of whole shells was observed in the dune field taphofacies, while sharp fragments and open-articulated bivalves in hydrodynamic unstable positions characterize the lacustrine plain taphofacies.

Our foci were annual runoff conditions, runoff origins (rain, snowmelt, and glacier ice), and runoff spatiotemporal variability. Low and high runoff conditions were defined as occurrences that fall outside the 10th (low values) and 90th (high values) percentile values of the period of record. SnowModel and HydroFlow modeling tools were used at 4-km horizontal grid increments and 3-h time intervals. NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) datasets were used as atmospheric forcing. This modeling system includes evaporation and sublimation from snow-covered surfaces, but it does not take into account evapotranspiration from bare and vegetation-covered soils and from river and lake surfaces. In general for the Andes Cordillera, the simulated runoff decreased before 1997 and increased afterward. This could be due to a model precipitation artifact in the MERRA forcing. If so, this artifact would influence the number of years with low runoff values, which decreased over time, while the number of high runoff values increased over time. For latitudes south of similar to 40 degrees S, both the greatest decrease in the number of low runoff values and the greatest increase in high runoff values occurred. High runoff values averaged 84% and 58% higher than low values for nonglacierized and glacierized catchments, respectively. Furthermore, for glacierized catchments, 61% and 62% of the runoff originated from rain-derived runoff during low and high runoff extreme years, respectively; 28% and 30% from snowmelt-derived runoff; and 11% and 8% from glacier-ice-melt-derived runoff. As the results could be MERRA dependent, more work with other precipitation forcings and/or in situ measurements is needed to assess whether these are real runoff behaviors or artifacts.					; Mernild, Sebastian H./M-5516-2013; Casassa, Gino/AAX-6142-2020; Yde, Jacob/M-8839-2017	Yde, Jacob Clement/0000-0002-6211-2601; Mernild, Sebastian H./0000-0003-0797-3975; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JUL	2018	19	7					1167	1189		10.1175/JHM-D-17-0094.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0094.1													WOS:000440280800001

This study presents a comparative analysis of Collection 6.1 MODIS AOD retrievals and ground measurements from five local sites and one Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, which significantly complements the previous validation that utilized limited AERONET measurements. Generally, MODIS AOD retrievals showed a reasonable agreement with collocated ground measurements (R-2 > 0.7), with 66% of Dark Target (DT) 10 km retrievals, 56% of Deep Blue (DB) 10 km retrievals, and 69% of DT 3 km retrievals falling within the expected error (EE = +/-(0.05 + 0.2 x AOD)). Nevertheless, it was found that the DT AOD retrievals tended to be overestimated over urbanized and lakeside sites, while the DB AOD retrievals tended to be underestimated over all ground sites except for lakeside sites. Such patterns appeared to be linked with the systematic biases of the single-scattering albedo estimation in the AOD retrieval algorithms. Another significant finding of this study is that the uncertainties of the MODIS AOD retrievals were highly correlated with the land cover proportions of urbanized features and water (LCP_UW) in the surrounding region, especially for the DT products. An empirical correction method based on these correlations could substantially reduce the uncertainties of DT AOD products over high LCP_UW areas. The results not only highlight the significant impacts of both urban and water areas on the MODIS AOD retrieval algorithms but also create new possibilities to correct such impacts once the universal correlations between LCP_UW and the uncertainty measures are established.					; qi, bing/HMD-7871-2023; GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023; Yu, Zhifeng/AAG-4387-2019	Kun, Sun/0000-0002-8718-0045; 														2072-4292				FEB	2022	14	4							938	10.3390/rs14040938	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14040938													WOS:000765163100001

The high latitudes are particularly vulnerable to positive feedbacks that amplify change through atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions. Unfortunately, the short instrumental record does not capture the full range of past or projected climate scenarios (a situation particularly acute in the high latitudes). Natural archives from past periods warmer than present day, however, can be used to explore drivers and responses to forcing, and provide data against which to test models, thereby offering insights into the future. The Last Interglacial (129-116,000 years before present) - the warmest interglacial of the last 800,000 years - was the most recent period during which global temperatures were comparable with low-end 21st Century projections (up to 2 degrees C warmer, with temperature increase amplified over polar latitudes), providing a potentially useful analogue for future change. Substantial environmental changes happened during this time. Here we synthesise the nature and timing of potential high-latitude tipping elements during the Last Interglacial, including sea ice, extent of the boreal forest, permafrost, ocean circulation, and ice sheets/ sea level. We also review the thresholds and feedbacks that likely operated through this period. Notably, substantial ice mass loss from Greenland, the West Antarctic, and possibly sectors of the East Antarctic drove a 6-9 m rise in global sea level. This was accompanied by reduced summer sea-ice extent, poleward-extended boreal forest, and reduced areas of permafrost. Despite current chronological uncertainties, we find that tipping elements in the high latitudes all experienced rapid and abrupt change (within 1-2 millennia of each other) across both hemispheres, while recovery to prior conditions took place over multi-millennia. Our synthesis demonstrates important feedback loops between tipping elements, amplifying polar and global change during the Last Interglacial. The high sensitivity and tight interconnections between polar tipping elements suggests that they could exhibit similar thresholds of vulnerability in the future, particularly if the aspirations of the Paris Agreement are not met.

Speleothem data from Corchia Cave (Tuscany) currently provide the most precise terrestrial chronology and constrain the wettest interval to ca. 8.2 to 7.3 ka. We have traced this isotopic signal to the north and observe a synchronous isotopic change in stalagmites from southalpine and eastalpine caves, but in opposite direction. We attribute this to a shift in the local moisture balance, i.e. to a higher proportion of moisture advected from the Mediterranean Sea relative to the otherwise dominant northwesterly air masses in the Alps. This isotopic source effect can be traced up to the northern rim of the Alps, albeit with decreasing amplitude. Forest density at the treeline in the Central Alps decreased during this time interval indicating short vegetation periods consistent with rainy summers. The glaciers in the Eastern Alps, which did not show far-reaching advances during the preceding 8.2 ka event, responded strongly (positively) to this humid phase. Additionally, two of the largest alluvial fans in the Eastern Alps showed a massive accumulation peak radiocarbon dated to between ca. 8.3 to 7.4 ka and thus providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence for anomalously high rainfall intensities coeval with 'pluvial' conditions in the Mediterranean region.

The integration of digital elevation models, outcrop, borehole, ground-penetrating radar and high-resolution shear-wave seismic data allows for a comprehensive analysis of these delta systems and provides information about the distinct types of deltaic facies and geometries generated under different lake-level trends. The exposed delta sediments record mainly the phase of maximum lake level and subsequent lake drainage. The stair-stepped profiles of the delta systems reflect the progressive basinward lobe deposition during forced regression when the lakes successively drained. Depending on the rate and magnitude of lake-level fall, fan-shaped, lobate or more digitate tongue-like delta morphologies developed. Deposits of the stair-stepped transgressive delta bodies are buried, downlapped and onlapped by the younger forced regressive deposits. The delta styles comprise both Gilbert-type deltas and shoal-water deltas. The sedimentary facies of the steep Gilbert-type delta foresets include a wide range of gravity-flow deposits. Delta deposits of the forced-regressive phase are commonly dominated by coarse-grained debrisflow deposits, indicating strong upslope erosion and cannibalization of older delta deposits. Deposits of supercritical turbidity currents are particularly common in sand-rich Gilbert-type deltas that formed during slow rises in lake level and during highstands. Foreset beds consist typically of laterally and vertically stacked deposits of antidunes and cyclic steps. The trigger mechanisms for these supercritical turbidity currents were both hyperpycnal meltwater flows and slope-failure events. Shoal-water deltas formed at low water depths during both low rates of lake-level rise and forced regression. Deposition occurred from tractional flows. Transgressive mouthbars form laterally extensive sand-rich delta bodies with a digitate, multi-tongue morphology. In contrast, forced regressive gravelly shoal-water deltas show a high dispersion of flow directions and form laterally overlapping delta lobes. Deformation structures in the forced-regressive ice-marginal deltas are mainly extensional features, including normal faults, small graben or half-graben structures and shear-deformation bands, which are related to gravitational delta tectonics, postglacial faulting during glacial-isostatic adjustment, and crestal collapse above salt domes. A neotectonic component cannot be ruled out in some cases.					; Lang, Joerg/KOC-7485-2024	Igel, Jan/0000-0002-7513-5722; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2018	47	4					973	1002		10.1111/bor.12317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12317													WOS:000444943600001

The measured TGM fluxes over water exhibited a consistent diurnal pattern, with maximum emissions during daytime and minimum fluxes occurring at night. Pearson correlation analysis showed that solar radiation was the most influential environmental parameter in TGM air-water exchange. Significant correlations were also found between TGM fluxes and 1 hour time-lagged water temperature, indicating the enhancement of fluxes by bacterial activities or chemical reactions. The concentrations of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) in water were measured during the 2003 sampling period and indicated that DGM was always supersaturated, which implied that the water body acted primarily as a source of mercury to the atmosphere. Several empirical models of mercury air-water gas exchange were developed and evaluated. Compared to the published models, these proposed models were capable of producing good results, leading to a better agreement between the measured and modeled fluxes (improvements by 48-98%). Among these empirical models, the ones linking TGM fluxes with net radiation were superior because of their strong predictive capability. Two preferred models were selected for air-water TGM flux estimation from Lake St. Pierre's surrounding wetlands. These two models yield a mean emission of 0.19-0.24 kg mercury during May-September each year from 1999 to 2003.					; Garcia, Edenise/AAO-5834-2020; Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008; Pilote, Martin/G-2581-2016	Beauvais, Conrad/0009-0002-2142-3873; Amyot, Marc/0000-0002-0340-3249; Pilote, Martin/0000-0002-6874-5135													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 8	2006	111	D17							D17307	10.1029/2005JD006930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JD006930													WOS:000240420300002

Moreover, the potential size of the algal inoculum and the migation to the water during summer were estimated. The surplus phosphorus content of the resting colonies in the sediment was about 45% of total phosphorus, which maximized at 8.5 mug P (mg dw)-1 or 81 ng P colony-1. The C:P ratio (by weight) in the early colonies appearing in the lake water was 50:1, while the ratio stabilized at 150 during the major migration period. The internal supply of surplus phosphorus was used during the pelagic growth of the colonies. The internal phosphorus loading to the epilimnion of Lake Erken due to Gloeotrichia migration could, from the measurements of the increase in particulate epilimnetic phosphorus, be estimated at 40 mg P m-2 or 2.5 mg p m-2 d-1 in late July and early August. Determination of the number of colonies in the sediment before and during the migration verified this value to be a conservative estimate of the internal phosphorus loading due to Gloeotrichia migration to the epilimnion in Lake Erken. The sediment P content calculated from the P concentration in early epilimnion colonies resulted in a value of 35 mug P (g dw)-1 as a maximum. This corresponds to only 3% of the total phosphorus content in Lake Erken sediment.

This has resulted in changes in the aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, but historical records on the composition of the past vegetation on centennial scale are scarce. In this study, we examined changes in the terrestrial and aquatic plant communities in and around Lower Lake Constance using metabarcoding of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) of three cores from different sub-basins covering the past, up to 300 years. We successfully identified an average of c. 3000 sequence variants (molecular operational taxonomic units - MOTUs) and obtained a taxonomically annotated dataset of 127 species, 104 genera, and 72 families. We could detect major changes in the terrestrial and aquatic vegetation of the Lower Lake Constance region by examining the cores. For example, alpha diversity decreased in the last c. 100 years, and this decrease was more pronounced in the terrestrial than in the aquatic plant community. Unlike the terrestrial plant community, the current aquatic plant-community composition partially resembles the community from before the 20th-century eutrophication phase of the lake. In addition to changes that can be attributed to anthropogenic impacts, we also captured the effect of DNA sedimentation on the terrestrial DNA diversity representation in sediments during periods of extensive flooding and potentially as a consequence of extremely cold winters. With sedDNA from Lower Lake Constance, we provide a new local dataset to investigate and extend the historical changes of different shoreline habitats and to identify characteristic and invasive plant species. Such highly resolved datasets spanning the past centuries can provide detailed information on human environmental history in densely populated regions that have undergone severe changes in the recent past.

J	Spence, C				Spence, C			The effect of storage on runoff from a headwater subarctic shield basin	ARCTIC												Canadian Shield runoff production processes have been investigated, but research is needed beyond the hillslope scale to determine the influences on the volume and timing of runoff from headwater basins to higher-order streams. Such research will permit an understanding of the magnitude of climate change impacts at the watershed scale, where changes in the hydrologic regime are felt most by water resource users. To this end, water budget terms were measured over different portions of a headwater lake basin north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, during the spring snowmelt of 1998 to determine the relative importance of each component as water moved through the basin. Evaporation made up 16% and runoff 70% of the snowmelt from upland areas. Upland pending of water during the melt increased the evaporative loss. Headwater lake storage deficits are very important in the timing and volume of runoff that is transmitted downstream: 53% of basin meltwater went to meeting the storage deficit in the lake so that only 7% of the meltwater was routed out of the basin. These results imply that topology of shield headwater basins, notably the location of lakes and antecedent water levels in lakes, are important in determining the runoff response. As storage deficits in surface waters will cause changes over space in runoff response and timing, it may be inappropriate to consider the snowpack or rainfall volume in isolation when forecasting runoff volume. These results are important for water management and hydrological modeling applications of northern shield basins.																			0004-0843					SEP	2000	53	3					237	247																WOS:000089687100005

An 11 000-year-long record of fire and vegetation history at Beaver Lake, Oregon, central Willamette Valley	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis were used to reconstruct an 11 000-year-long record of fire and vegetation history from Beaver Lake, Oregon, the first complete Holocene paleoecological record from the floor of the Willamette Valley. In the early Holocene (ca 11 000-7500 calendar years before present [cal yr BP]), warmer, drier summers than at present led to the establishment of xeric woodland of Quercus, Corylus, and Pseudotsuga near the site. Disturbances (i.e., floods, fires) were common at this time and as a result Alnus rubra grew nearby. High fire frequency occurred in the early Holocene from ca 11 200-9300 cal yr BP. Riparian forest and wet prairie developed in the middle Holocene (ca 7500 cal yr BP), likely the result of a decrease in the frequency of flooding and a shift to effectively cooler, wetter conditions than before. The vegetation at Beaver Lake remained generally unchanged into the late Holocene (from 4000 cal yr BP to present), with the exception of land clearance associated with Euro-American settlement of the valley (ca 160 cal yr BP). Middle-to-late Holocene increases in fire frequency, coupled with abrupt shifts in fire-episode magnitude and charcoal composition, likely indicate the influence anthropogenic burning near the site. The paleoecological record from Beaver Lake, and in particular the general increase in fire frequency over the last 8500 years, differs significantly from other low-elevation sites in the Pacific Northwest, which suggests that local controls (e.g., shifts in vegetation structure, intensification of human land-use), rather than regional climatic controls, more strongly influenced its environmental history.

All lake trout stocked in Lake Huron had one or more fins clipped (removed). The proportion of lake trout without clipped fins was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in spring gillnet assessments and sport catches from MH-2 (Thunder Bay area) than from other management districts in western Lake Huron. The proportion of the MH-2 survey catch that was unclipped was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among the 1984-90 year classes than previous cohorts. A spawning population of predominantly unclipped lake trout was discovered on Mischley Reef in Thunder Bay. The trawl catch of YOY and the increasing incidence of unclipped older lake trout in MH-2 suggest, therefore, that the lake trout stock is partly supported by reproduction. However, the mean age of unclipped lake trout in assessment catches did not increase appreciably in 1986-1993. Total mortality rates for lake trout in MH-2 during this period ranged near 50%. Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) wounding rates were as high as 40 wounds per 100 lake trout. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance was high in June on near-shore reefs, but low on Mischley Reef where lake trout reproduced successfully. Development of wild lake trout stocks in Thunder Bay may be stymied by a combination of factors, including sea lamprey-induced mortality and predation on swim-up fry by alewives.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			253	259		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71098-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71098-X													WOS:A1995UL89400021
J	Lamoureux, S				Lamoureux, S			Temporal patterns of suspended sediment yield following moderate to extreme hydrological events recorded in varved lacustrine sediments	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												A 487-year annually laminated (varved) sediment record from Nicolay Lake, Cornwall Island, in the Canadian High Arctic was evaluated to determine the impact that years with high sediment yields had on sediment yields in subsequent years. All of the 40 largest years showed evidence for increased sediment yield in the subsequent 10-30 years. The positive anomalies in lagging years were approximately scaled according to the size of the initiating year, although many intermediate years (25- to 100-year recurrence) showed weak or variable responses. The smallest events considered (10- to 25-year recurrence) showed a consistent. but low-amplitude response. Additionally the 10-year events revealed frequent negative sediment yield anomalies in the preceding decade. This behaviour was interpreted as a frequent sediment activation cycle initiated by the modest year, and leading to sediment yield hysteresis lasting 15-25 years. The largest years (greater than 50-year recurrence) showed consistently above-average sediment yields in the preceding decade, in part due to the frequent occurrence of moderate (Q(10)) years. It is hypothesized that temporary storage of sediment and previous initiation of erosion sites resulted in extraordinary sediment yields during intense summer rainfall events. This study demonstrates the potential use of varved lake sediment records to improve our understanding of long-term sediment dynamics. These records present an opportunity to further develop and test sediment dynamic and routing models to gain insight into the interaction of time and space in fluvial and sediment delivery processes.

J	HART, SR; STEINHART, JS; SMITH, TJ				HART, SR; STEINHART, JS; SMITH, TJ			TERRESTRIAL HEAT-FLOW IN LAKE-SUPERIOR	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Using oceanographic heat-flow techniques, 162 measurements of heat flow were made in Lake Superior during the summers of 1966 and 1967. These data are of high quality, with precisions with respect to intercomparisons typically in the 3-5% range. The data define two very clear features. One is a trough of low heat-flow values, which runs continuously for 650 km along the northern edge of the lake, with values ranging between 0.46 and 0.98 heat-flow units (HFU) (19.2-41.0 mW/m2). This feature correlates with surface exposure of Keweenawan mafic volcanics; it is believed to delineate a major crustal separation associated with the Midcontinent Rift and is filled to crustal thicknesses with mafic intrusives and extrusives. This feature has not been imaged with the seismic reflection profiling of GLIMPCE. The other heat-flow feature is an arcuate ridge of high heat-flow values (1.0-1.45 HFU; 41.8-60.7 mW/m2), parallel to and south of the heat-flow trough. The highest areas of this ridge correspond to areas of thick rift-filling Keweenawan sediments. The high heat flow is modulated to lower values in areas where the thick sediments overlie highly thinned crust now containing large thicknesses of mafic volcanic rock. The heat-flow features show very good correlation with the magnetic anomaly map of Lake Superior, but only spotty correlation with the Bouguer gravity anomaly features.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				APR	1994	31	4					698	708		10.1139/e94-062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e94-062													WOS:A1994NT98200009

It is widely used to understand how ecological processes influence biotic assemblages. With an aim to increase our knowledge about dragonfly ecological requirements in tufa-depositing karst habitats, we assessed functional diversity of their assemblages, various life history traits (e.g., stream zonation preference, substrate preference, reproduction type), and relationship between functional diversity and physico-chemical water properties in three types of karst lotic habitats (springs, streams, and tufa barriers) in a biodiversity hotspot in the western Balkan Peninsula. Dragonfly functional diversity was mainly characterized by traits typical for lotic rheophile species with medium dispersal capacity. Among the investigated habitats, tufa barriers, characterized by higher (micro)habitat heterogeneity, higher water velocity, as well as lower conductivity and concentration of nitrates, can be considered as dragonfly functional diversity hotspots. Functional diversity and most of the life history traits were comparable among different substrate types in the studied habitats, indicating higher importance of habitat type in shaping dragonfly functional diversity patterns in karst lotic habitats. Our results should be considered in the management and conservation activities of vulnerable karst freshwater ecosystems and their dragonfly assemblages.

The study involved 1960-1963 brood-year fish. During the 4 yr period, 1961-64, 11.5 million fish were released, of which 3.4 million were marked by the removal of the adipose fin and part of one of the maxillary bones.sbd.the right maxillary for 1960 and 1962 broods and the left maxillary for 1961 and 1963 broods. Trapping at the lake outlet in the spring for the first 2 yr indicated that less than 50% of the stocked fingerlings migrated. In 1964-67, recovery of marks from the commercial fishery on the Colombia below and the Indian fishery above Bonneville Dam showed that an average of 13.6% of the sockeye salmon catch was composed of fish raised at Leavenworth Hatchery. Adjusting for effects of marking represents an average fishery value per brood of $4274.75. The average potential benefit/cost ratio for the 4 yr of the program was 0.04:1. Because preliminary data indicated such a low benefit/cost ratio, sockeye salmon rearing at Leavenworth was radically decreased in 1966 and terminated in 1969.																			0090-0656	1937-4518					1979	77	1					229	242																WOS:A1979GX72500012

Algal cells can migrate to the sediment surface in winter and maintain biological activity, which could further affect the cycling process of sed-iment phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe). In this study, a pilot simulation experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of overwintering cyanobacteria (Owc) on P and Fe regeneration across the sediment-water interface (SWI). Owc ester-ase activity ranged from 16.4 to 26.6 nmol (FDA)/(L center dot h), with a fluctuating increasing trend within the incubation time. Compared with the control (no Owc), Owc treatment increased the redox potential value (Eh) at the SWI but slightly decreased the pH during the first stage of this experiment (0-24 d); however, the Eh at the SWI under Owc treatment decreased to 50.9 % of that of the control on day 90. The Fe(II) could rapidly oxidized to Fe (oxyhydro)oxides and com-bine with phosphate in high Eh environments, and Owc inhibited P and Fe release at the SWI within 24 days; however, the continuous decrease in Eh resulted in the reduction of Fe(III). Thus, the Fe concentration measured via diffusive gradients in thin films in the Owc-treated interstitial water gradually increased to 1.92 times that of the control, pro-moting the release of Fe and P across the SWI. For 13 days after Owc addition, the amount of mobile P in the sediment was significantly higher than that in the control, and it gradually decreased from day 24 to 90, with the lowest being approximately 74.1 % of the amount in the control. The reactive Fe concentration in the sediment showed a similar variation trend. These results indicate that mobile P and reactive Fe in the sediment could be the main sources of regeneration across the SWI in the presence of Owc.

Facies analysis and correlation of surface sections and core document remarkable lateral continuity of depositional cycles within the Wilkins Peak Member. New mapping and facies analysis this stratigraphic framework into Wilkins Peak Member-equivalent strata adjacent to the Uinta Uplift, where a peripheral facies belt contains lacustrine and fluvial facies that are compositionally distinct from basin interior facies. Peripheral belt lithofacies are composed of limestone and quartzose siliciclastic detritus, whereas basin interior strata are largely dolomite and fine-grained arkosic detritus. Strata at both peripheral and interior facies belts contains a clear oscillation between two modes: (1) a lacustrine mode, associated with rapid lake expansion and contraction with precipitation of carbonate and evaporites from saline lake waters; and (2) an alluvial mode, associated with low lake level and lower lake salinity and a basin-ward shift in alluvial depositional environments. Radioisotopic geochronology suggests that lacustrine-alluvial cycles strongly follow 100 k.y. eccentricity, with lacustrine modes occurring during eccentricity maxima, and alluvial modes coinciding with eccentricity minima. Alluvial fans were built into the Bridger subbasin over 2-4 million year timescales, with their coarsest-grained portions corresponding to unroofing of durable Paleozoic strata from the Uinta Uplift. From 56 to 47 Ma, successive fans propagated westward as unroofing expanded away from a structural culmination in the Uinta Uplift. Calcite-rich lithofacies including spring deposits are concentrated near faults and alluvial fan toes, and likely were promoted by the mixing of Ca-rich meteoric and/or hydrothermal waters with bicarbonate-rich lake waters. Accounting for the absence of basin interior-focused lithofacies in the Tipton Member of the Green River Formation, tectonic accommodation appears to have been continuous rather than episodic from the late Paleocene to the Early Eocene.																			2211-2731		978-94-017-9906-5; 978-94-017-9905-8				2015	1						61	102		10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_4	10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5												WOS:000380960200005

CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												The inferior mirage from road surfaces is a common phenomenon, which can be easily seen in everyday life. It has been recognized in the literature as a light refraction phenomenon due to the refractive index gradient caused by the temperature gradient in the air strata above the road surfaces. However, it was also suggested that the mirage is just a phenomenon of specular reflection at grazing incidence. Because of the lack of reasonable and quantitative evidence, the generally accepted light refraction theory has not yet been refuted. Here we show some mirror-like reflection images captured from a road surface stretch in Yujiashan North Road, Wuhan, China, when there was no obvious temperature gradient on or above the road, measured on a winter day in December 2009. This provided direct evidence to doubt the temperature induced light refraction mechanism of the inferior mirage. Furthermore, the critical grazing angle of about 0.2A degrees to the road plane where the mirror-like reflection appears could not make the rough surface scatter incident light as a smooth surface according to the Rayleigh criterion. Therefore the phenomenon is a mirrorlike observation effect of scattering from the surface, which cannot be entirely explained by light refraction via air strata. The results demonstrate that the image-formation mechanism and the observer-based-analysis method shown here potentially offer a means of understanding a wide range of scattering phenomena from rough surfaces at grazing angle; for example, the superior mirages of unusual brightness occasionally observed over frozen lakes and the off-specular reflection phenomenon.					; huang, zhifeng/KRQ-3503-2024; Liu, Chengxi/HZL-7278-2023; Zhou, Huaichun/G-8693-2011	Zhou, Huaichun/0000-0003-4900-6609; Cheng, Qiang/0000-0002-4370-2120; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				APR	2011	56	10					962	968		10.1007/s11434-011-4347-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4347-9													WOS:000289729100003
J	Wooller, MJ; Agnew, ADQ				Wooller, MJ; Agnew, ADQ			Changes in graminoid stomatal morphology over the last glacial-interglacial transition: evidence from Mount Kenya, East Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Stomatal size and density were measured from graminoid cuticular fragments extracted from dated sediments in two tropical-montane crater lakes on Mount Kenya. The sediments had been dated in other studies and spanned 150037 000 calibrated years BP. Changes in the mean size and density of the graminoid stomata were found. Using a coarse signal analysis the two lakes gave fairly similar results, although there was some divergence at the start and end of the time period analyzed. There is some correspondence between the atmospheric CO2 concentration and graminoid stomatal density during the transition from the LGM to the start of the Holocene, where stomatal density decreased while CO2 concentrations increased. All the changes observed may have been plastic responses within existing species at the site or competitive replacements of grass floras. We argue that higher stomatal density may have been a response to falling CO2 levels during the last glaciation, accompanying the replacement of a C-3 flora by C-4 species. The stomatal size changes exhibited over this time period may have adapted plants to changes in soil water availability. That stomatal morphology changes in a sample flora (not a single taxon) over millennia is a novel finding, and one that may have implications for paleoecological interpretation and the prediction of grass behavior in the future.

J	Braithwaite, CJR; Zedef, V				Braithwaite, CJR; Zedef, V			Hydromagnesite stromatolites and sediments in an alkaline lake, Salda Golu, Turkey	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Salda Lake in SW Turkey is a highly alkaline (pH > 9) water body with waters enriched in magnesium, Microbial stromatolites along shorelines contain a microflora of diatoms and cyanobacteria with extensive associated biofilms. Together these are responsible for precipitation of hydromagnesite, although distribution is not congruent with either cells or films. Deposition has continued over several thousand years and is independent of both lake volume and the general concentration of lake waters. The lake is rimmed on three sides by serpentinites and on the fourth by dolomite, The bulk of the water entering the lake is meteoric, fed via extensive gravelly alluvial fan deltas (with predominantly serpentinite pebbles) whose total areas and catchments exceed that of the lake. These waters are significantly cooler than surface waters of the lake, and there is no evidence for derivation from hot springs, The magnesium is thought to have been leached from the gravels. Extensive areas of recent sediments accumulating on shorelines have apparently formed by mechanical breakdown of microbialites. Similar deposits form conspicuous terraces in two areas and point to the longterm effectiveness of these processes, Terrace deposits are modified by a variety of subaerial processes, including growth of hydromagnesite cements. No microbial structures are preserved in these, and it is presumed that they are destroyed during reworking. Fine-grained hydromagnesite sediment derived from shorelines and from terraces is suspended in the water column during storms and is probably redeposited as turbidites in the deeper parts of the lake, Sediments of this kind may be a useful analogue for some ancient and economically important stratiform magnesite deposits.

One farmed population, Sial (Societe ivoirienne d'aquaculture lagunaire) in Ebrie Lagoon was also examined. The number of alleles was high in all three loci (29 to 30) and the number of the average number of alleles per population varied from 22.0 to 6.67. Smaller heterozygosities were observed in Selingue dam and Sial farm, whereas the three natural populations had higher and comparable heterozygosities. Between 17% to 60% of alleles were "private". On the basis of neutrality and random mating, one can compare effective population sizes. The five populations appear to fall into three categories in this respect: Niger Dam and Sial Farm are the smaller, followed by Volta, followed by Senegal and Ebrie. Most populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An exception is the sample from Senegal river, at Dagana, where a trend for excess of homozygotes is present in all loci, with significant values for two out Of three loci. Based on these three loci a factorial analysis of correspondence of all specimen studied provides a good assignment of individuals to populations. These results show that microsatellite is the tool of choice for population monitoring, preservation of genetic diversity and breeding programs in aquaculture.

With widespread permafrost degradation likely to occur in this century, remote sensing of permafrost is seeking to unveil the processes and causal connections governing this development, from the monitoring of variables related to the permafrost state to the mapping of the impacts of degradation and potential natural hazards on the ground. However, remote sensing of permafrost is challenging. The physical subsurface variables which characterize its thermal state-ground temperature, ice content and thaw depth-are not directly measurable through current remote sensing technologies. Instead, there is a large diversity of target characteristics for remote sensing from which the permafrost state can be indirectly derived. Mountain permafrost environments are characterized by a strong heterogeneity on small spatial scales, so that high-resolution remote sensors are generally required. Permafrost landforms and surface features, such as rock glaciers, thermokarst lakes and push moraines, can be identified by image classification techniques in a variety of remote sensing products. Permafrost-related vertical and horizontal surface deformations can be identified by repeat digital elevation models, or radar interferometry. Similar techniques are applied in the Arctic lowland permafrost areas to identify and map indicators of thawing ice-rich permafrost, such as thermokarst, thaw slumps, or coastal erosion. In some areas, the presence of permafrost correlates with certain vegetation types or surface covers, which can be mapped from satellite sensors. Furthermore, in the vast lowland permafrost areas, physical variables directly or indirectly related to thermal subsurface conditions are accessible through more coarsely resolved remote sensing techniques. These include the land surface temperature, the freeze-thaw state of the surface and subsurface, and the gravimetric signal from the ground. Recently, there is progress towards quantitative monitoring of ground temperatures and thaw depths by employing remote sensing data in conjunction with thermal subsurface modeling. By exploiting the cumulative information content of several remote sensing data sets through data fusion strategies, the best possible estimate for the ground thermal state can be achieved.

Five days postinfection, 4th-stage larvae were found attached to the posterior 3rd of the esophagus. The 4th molt occurred 11 days postinfection and worms were found throughout the esophagus. Females were gravid 27 days postinfection. Various developmental stages are described. Infective larvae became encapsulated on the mesentery of experimentally infected goldfish (Carassius auratus) and a shiner (Notropis sp.). Infective larvae were found in various fish collected in waters adjacent to the gull colony. Regular examination of adult gulls indicated birds acquired infections soon after arriving from the wintering grounds. There was little evidence that transmission occurred in the latter regions. Young-of-the-year birds acquired infections by regurgitation of 4th-stage larvae and adult worms along with food during feeding by parents and from infective larvae contained in the fish given to them by the parents.

The studied rock unit, formally named the Mawi Formation, was previously mapped as pre-Tertiary in age. Our palynological result suggested that the age determination for the Mawi Formation is late Miocene to Pliocene. Two sedimentary facies succession was inferred from the studied section: the delta-lacustrine succession (FS1) and the incised-valley fill succession (FS2). The orogeny of LFTB and PFTB (Papua Fold and Thrust Belt) are inferred to be developed simultaneously in the latest Miocene, within the NN11 zone or N17 to lower part of N18 zones, within the range of 8.3 to 5.6 Ma. The studied sediment in the Mawi section is deposited in the wedge-top part of the Lengguru foreland system, while the Bintuni basin is its foredeep depozone and the Berau basin is in the backbulge depozone. FS1 is interpreted to be formed in the lake between the active thrust fault of LFTB during the late Miocene to early Pliocene. Relative sea-level began to fall during the end of early Pliocene, resulting in the widespread erosion of the depositional site, and the incised valley formed. The first deposit during the interval of low sea level was the alluvial deposit, followed by the rising of the local relative sea-level, which resulted in the filling of the incised valley depositing estuarine deposits of FS2.

Spawning occurs in late May or early June, with year-to-year variability in the onset of spawning associated with differences in water temperature. After metamorphosis from the larval phase, some parasitic-phase lampreys move downstream, but others may feed parasitically in the same location where spawning and larval rearing occur. Parasitic attachments tend to occur relatively more often at night. Captive lampreys were able to attack successfully in complete darkness, but during the daytime they did not respond to visual cues when separated from hosts by a glass barrier. Like other parasitic species, chestnut lampreys tend to be size selective. Attachments tended to occur dorsally on hosts both in the laboratory and in the field. Host species in the Saint Croix River system include redhorse, northern pike, and brown trout. Much of the growth achieved during the parasitic phase occurs during the summer, but there is substantial variability in size on any given date. Although there is overlap in length, females achieve greater lengths than males. In comparison to the Manistee River and other Lake Michigan tributaries in western Michigan, the chestnut lamprey in the St. Croix River drainage has been less often perceived as a threat to trout, perhaps because of the greater availability of redhorse and other large catostomids.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					2014	29	4					491	505		10.1080/02705060.2014.910477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.910477													WOS:000341761700003

This paper presents detailed pollen records from a typical open Lake Baiyangdian which helped to reconstruct multiple environmental processes and human activities in North China during the Holocene, and to detect the complexity of the reconstruction results. The Baiyangdian area experienced a gradual expansion of wetlands since the early Holocene which then transformed into vast delta swamps due to the Holocene transgression of the Bohai Sea. The subsequent regression resulted in the degradation of the swamps and the formation of grassland 6,500-4,500 cal yr BP. The area quickly became a shallow lake after 4,500 cal yr BP, and then gradually expanded with the strengthening of river processes. The relatively warm mid- Holocene climate significantly accelerated the emergence of agriculture, notably the slash-and-burn cultivation after 6,500 cal yr BP, and the continuous intensification of agricultural activities after 4,000 cal yr BP. Human activity became a significant factor of the environmental change in the Baiyangdian Lake region since 2700 cal yr BP. Our results indicate that the Holocene pollen records from large shallow lakes are often complicated by sedimentary processes and human activity, and should be carefully considered when reconstructing past climatic and environmental changes.

The accessory( -(b) under bar, -(c) under bar), and alternate (bacteriochlorophylls-(a) under bar, -(b) under bar, -(c) under bar, -(d) under bar, -(e) under bar) chlorophylls and the carotenoids provide additional biomarker specificity. That is, the presence of these pigments gives information about taxonomic structure. In the present study we utilized high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/photodiode array (PDA) methodology to investigate the photoautotrophic communities in Lake Okeechobee, Florida. Pigment distributions were measured in unispecific cultures and compared to literature reports on natural populations in order to generate equations for the estimation of the relative abundances of photoautotrophic taxa in seston, epiphytes, and benthic samples from 14 locations in the lake. The taxa and their specific biomarkers considered herein include: anoxygenic Eubacteria ( purple and green sulfur bacteria: bacteriochlorophylls-(a) under bar/-(c) under bar), Cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll), Chlorophyta (chlorophyll-(b) under bar lutein), Chrysophyta (fucoxanthin), and Pyrrhophyta (peridinin). The estimate of each taxon was based upon the relative abundance of the specific biomarker pigment for that group and its quantitative relationship to chlorophyll-(a) under bar. As examples of these methods, the technique of pigment-based chemotaxonomy is applied spatially and temporally to the photoautotrophic communities in Lake Okeechobee.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; Louda, J W/0000-0001-7280-9907													0097-6156		0-8412-3518-X				1997	671						77	91																WOS:A1997BJ87C00006

However, long-term measurements of CO2 dynamics in lakes are still lacking, but are necessary due to their large temporal variations. Herein, we present the long-term dynamics of water parameters in Lake Donghu from 2002 to 2016, and further calculate the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) based on the measurements of pH, water temperature, and alkalinity from 2008 to 2016. The results revealed that a significantly high pCO(2) occurred during the winter in Lake Donghu (p < 0.01), whereas no significant spatial difference was observed (p = 0.37). Statistical analysis indicated that the pCO(2) in the lake was only positively correlated with the total phosphorus (TP) concentration (p < 0.05). A multilinear regression model provided the best predictors for the pCO(2); however, it only explained 16% of the observed pCO(2) variability. This indicates the complex factors that influenced the pCO(2) in Lake Donghu between 2008 and 2016. Our estimated CO2 flux revealed that Lake Donghu acted as a small CO2 source to the atmosphere during this period, with a mean CO2 flux of 10.8 +/- 37.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) corresponding to a mean CO2 emission of 0.13 +/- 0.43 Gg year(-1). The CO2 emission fluxes in Lake Donghu were much lower than the mean CO2 fluxes reported for other lakes in China and globally. Furthermore, the long-term evolution of the CO2 flux indicated that Lake Donghu has shifted between acting as a CO2 source and sink, which highlights the need for long-term monitoring to accurately evaluate CO2 emissions from lakes.					; Xu, Xiaoguang/B-8203-2016; Ma, Jie/HMV-1388-2023; Yan, Xingcheng/JNE-4605-2023; Li, Zhichun/J-4196-2014; WANG, Guoxiang/LVS-0270-2024	Xu, Jie/0000-0002-5249-6197; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2021	28	9					10967	10976		10.1007/s11356-020-11374-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11374-y		OCT 2020						33106903					WOS:000584359600007

The role of predation risk in structuring life-history traits of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) in a series of small boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Predation is a major evolutionary force determining life-history traits in prey by direct and indirect mechanisms. This study focuses on life-history trait variation in crucian carp (Carassius carassius), a species well known for developing a deep body as an inducible morphological defence against predation risk. Here, the authors tested variation in growth and reproductive traits in 15 crucian carp populations in lakes along a predation risk gradient represented by increasingly efficient predator communities. Lakes were located in south-eastern Norway and were sampled in summer 2018 and 2019. The authors expected crucian carp to attain higher growth rate, larger size, and later age at maturity with increasing predation risk. In the absence of predators, they expected high adult mortality, early maturity and increased reproductive effort caused by strong intraspecific competition. They found that the life-history traits of crucian carp were clearly related to the presence of piscivores: with increasing predation risk, fish grew in body length and depth and attained larger asymptotic length and size at maturity. This growth was evident at young age, especially in productive lakes with pike, and it suggests that fish quickly outgrew the predation window by reaching a size refuge. Contrary to the authors' predictions, populations had similar age at maturity. High-predation lakes also presented low density of crucian carp. This suggests that fish from predator lakes may experience high levels of resource availability due to reduced intraspecific competition. Predation regulated life-history traits in crucian carp populations, where larger size, higher longevity and size at maturity were observed in lakes with large gaped predators.					de Meo, Ilaria/KAL-9182-2024	de Meo, Ilaria/0000-0003-1433-2017; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X													0022-1112	1095-8649				NOV	2023	103	5					939	949		10.1111/jfb.15485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15485		JUL 2023						37395556					WOS:001026837500001
J	Davies, TC				Davies, TC			Chemistry and pollution of natural waters in western Kenya	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Selected water analyses from the literature and current research in western Kenya are tabulated and the relationships between critical water quality parameters described. The waters are chemically characterised with Na as the dominant cation and bicarbonate as the dominant anion and, while waters of obviously different sources are represented, the available chemical data point to a general classification of bicarbonate-Na-rich waters, even for the saline waters of Lake Magadi. Potassium and chloride are among the less abundant constituents. The concentration level of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and sulphate) is mostly lower than maximum permissible drinking water levels, and salinity is not yet a serious problem in water bodies that are exploited for domestic and industrial purposes. Fluoride levels are variable with the higher values occurring in waters in and around the Rift Valley. Limited analytical data for in waters from the Eldoret, Kiambu and Nairobi areas indicate concentrations well above world average figures. Mean values of some key water quality indicators such as total dissolved solids, total suspended solids and heavy metals are well below the threshold for contaminated water. These values are however exceeded by several factors in saline waters of lakes and in some springs. Significant organic pollution is reflected by mean values of parameters such as biochemical oxygen demand and faecal coliforms. The present quality of most of the water bodies in this part of the country is considered to be adequate at present for domestic and other purposes, though a gradual decrease in quality is evident from the recent upsurge in industrial activities in the subregion.

Landscape response to hydroclimate variability shown by the post-Bonneville Flood (ca. 18 ka) fluvial-geomorphic history of the middle Snake River, Idaho, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The fluvial geomorphology and stratigraphy on the middle Snake River at Bancroft Springs, Idaho, provide evidence for numerous episodes of Snake River aggradation and incision since the Bonneville Flood at ca. 18 ka. A suite of seven terraces ranging from 20-1 m above modern bankfull elevation records multiple cut-and-fill cycles during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene in response to local base-level controls, variations in sediment supply, and hydroclimate change. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating show that the ages of fluvial aggradation generally coincide with increased sediment supply and likely wetter hydroclimate during onset of the Younger Dryas stadial (ca. 13.2 ka), deglaciation and termination of the Younger Dryas stadial (ca. 11.3 ka), Early Holocene cooling (ca. 8.8 ka), and Neoglacial (ca. 4.5, 2.9, 1.1 ka). Six intervening periods of incision and channel stability may also reflect either reduced sediment supply, drier hydroclimate, or both. The terrace chronology can be correlated to a variety of local and regional paleoclimate proxy records and corresponds well with periods of continental- and global-scale rapid climate change during the Holocene. The fluvial record demonstrates the geomorphic response and sensitivity of large river systems to changes in hydroclimate variability, which has important implications for inferring paleoenvironmental conditions in the region.

J	Chuang, HY; Sousounis, PJ				Chuang, HY; Sousounis, PJ			The impact of the prevailing synoptic situation on the lake-aggregate effect	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The effects of a group (aggregate) of relatively warm circular meso-beta-scale lakes on different flow regimes were investigated by conducting a series of idealized numerical experiments. This investigation was motivated by the observed behavior of synoptic-scale cyclones moving through the Great Lakes region during winter. Three with-lake (WL) and three corresponding no-lake (NL) simulations were initialized with 1) zonal flow, 2) a solitary trough, and 3) continuous sinusoidal waves, respectively. The WL experiments were intercompared to examine the importance of a preexisting disturbance and preconditioning. The NL simulations were compared to the corresponding WL simulations to study the contributions of the lake aggregate. The simulation results suggest that the lake aggregate induced or enhanced warm fronts when there were preexisting disturbances. They also suggest that a perturbation mesoscale aggregate vortex was generated in each of the three different flow scenarios even though the lake aggregate alone could only generate a weak meso-alpha-scale trough. To identify the physical processes that were altered by the lake aggregate to enhance cyclone development, surface pressure tendency diagnosis using the extended Zwack-Okossi (ZO) equation was applied to the simulation results. The results of the ZO surface pressure (PSFC) tendency diagnosis indicated that the preconditioning from the preceding ridge contributed to the further development of the lake-aggregate-enhanced cyclones. The results also indicated that the lake aggregate not only reduced the PSFC locally through surface sensible heating but also and, more importantly, contributed to large-scale surface pressure deepening by enhancing the surface warm front.																			0027-0644					MAY	2003	131	5					990	1010		10.1175/1520-0493(2003)131<0990:TIOTPS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2003)131<0990:TIOTPS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000182172000016

Use of otolith chemistry to assess recruitment and habitat use of a white bass fishery in a Nebraska reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Perrion MA, Kaemingk MA, Koupal KD, Schoenebeck CW, Bickford NA. 2019. Use of otolith chemistry to assess recruitment and habitat use of a white bass fishery in a Nebraska reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Managing fisheries that exhibit variable annual recruitment is challenging, and maintenance stockings are often prescribed to minimize interannual population variation. Maintenance stockings are costly and may not be necessary if sufficient natural recruitment is occurring. Therefore, developing tools and techniques that can collectively assess hatching origin and subsequent habitat use of individuals would be valuable. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy of otolith chemistry techniques to (1) determine whether there was evidence of natural recruitment within an annually stocked white bass population and (2) examine the potential to describe spatial reservoir use of these age-0 fish. A sample of hatchery-produced fingerling white bass (n = 17) was retained from a larger June 2015 stocking of white bass in Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, to characterize the hatchery fish natal elemental signatures. Age-0 white bass (n = 100) were then collected in Lake McConaughy in September 2015 from 2 sections of the reservoir (upper and main) to assess both natal origin (hatchery versus natural) and habitat use (upper versus main) using otolith concentrations of 5 chemical constituents at the otolith core and otolith edge, respectively. Otolith core signatures from the fall age-0 Lake McConaughy collected fish were different from the hatchery fish, indicating evidence for natural white bass recruitment. Otolith edge signatures were also distinct between fish collected from the upper and main sections of the reservoir. Otolith chemistry techniques can be useful for addressing challenges associated with managing erratic recruiting fish populations that are common to lake and reservoir systems.

Determinants of temperature in small coastal embayments of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Along 25 km of the Lake Ontario shoreline near Toronto, Ontario, small coastal embayments (0.4-32 ha) have been constructed or modified by lake-infilling to restore warmwater fish habitat. The variation in thermal habitat quality for warmwater fishes among these embayments is very high; temperatures range from those found within a small pond to those of much cooler Lake Ontario. Since meteorological conditions and surface heat fluxes are almost identical, the temperature variation among embayments must be caused by differences in bathymetry or exchange with Lake Ontario. However, a previous study on these embayments found paradoxically that temperatures were not strongly associated with channel size or embayment bathymetry. This paper resolves the paradox by showing that flushing times for almost all of the constructed embayments were less than 1 day, and often less than 12 h. With so little time to warm within the embayments, water temperatures of almost all embayments remained very close to the temperatures of the adjacent lake waters. The coldest embayments connected directly to open Lake Ontario and warmer embayments connected to Lake Ontario through other embayments or protected harbors, where the inflowing water from Lake Ontario had already substantially warmed. To allow embayments along the exposed shoreline of Toronto to reach acceptable temperatures for warmwater fish, we use heat budgets to calculate that average summer flushing times must be increased from their current length of 1.5 to 5.5 h to approximately 30 h. Such changes could be achieved through large reductions in the channel cross section. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Uncles, RJ				Uncles, Reginald J.			Note on a Surface-Film Delineated Lateral Front at the Head of a Shallow Tidal Creek	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Lateral surface frontal systems have been observed in the upper reaches of a small, low freshwater runoff, strongly tidal creek. They are a very striking visual feature of this water body when delineated by large quantities of surface film material. The fronts are mostly associated with a creek cross-section of somewhat reduced width and mudflat depth (the 'Ridge') compared with adjacent sections. Images are presented that show the tidal intrusion nature of the front and its subsequent development and final down-creek movement as a buoyant plume. Longitudinal and vertical surveys of salinity during a mean-range tide demonstrate the strong stratification that exists in this shallow water body, which, at high water (HW), is typically 1-2 m deep in the narrow main channel. Velocity measurements indicate that a critical inflow Froude number is associated with the initial formation stage of the front. Subsequent frontal locations and behaviour qualitatively correspond to the relative balance between tidal current and surface-layer buoyancy current speeds. Vertical profiling data and bed- mounted salinity sensors during a strong spring tide with low freshwater runoff demonstrate only minor surface stratification and layering on the flood. Nevertheless, the inflow Froude number exceeds unity at the Ridge at peak flood, which is indicative of up-creek frontal formation, and a strongly stratified plume propagates through the Ridge section on the ebb.					; Uncles, Reginald/ABH-3502-2022	Uncles, Reginald/0000-0002-8004-4796; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				MAY	2023	46	3					878	890		10.1007/s12237-022-01153-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-022-01153-y		FEB 2023											WOS:000921785700001

Investigating impacts of small dams and dam removal on dissolved oxygen in streams	PLOS ONE												Small surface-release dams are prevalent across North American watersheds and can alter stream flow, thermal regimes, nutrient dynamics, and sediment transport. These dams are often implicated as a cause of negative water quality impacts-including reduced dissolved oxygen (DO)-and dam removal is increasingly employed to restore natural stream processes and improve DO. Published impacts of small dams on DO vary widely across sites, and even less is known about the extent and timescale of DO recovery following removal. Therefore, we sought to quantify the effects of small dams and dam removal on DO and determine the dam, stream, and watershed characteristics driving inter-site variation in responses. We deployed continuous data loggers for 3 weeks during summer months in upstream (reference), impoundment, and downstream reaches at each of 15 dammed sites and collected equivalent data at 10 of those sites following dam removal. Prior to dam removal, most sites (60%) experienced a decrease in DO (an average of 1.15 mg/L lower) within the impoundment relative to upstream, but no consistent impacts on diel ranges or on downstream reaches. Before dam removal, 5 impacted stream reaches experienced minimum DO levels below acceptable water quality standards (<5 mg/L); after dam removal, 4 of 5 of these reaches met DO standards. Sites with wider impoundments relative to upstream widths and sites located in watersheds with more cultivated land experienced the greatest decreases in impoundment DO relative to upstream. Within one year following dam removal, impoundment DO recovered to upstream reference conditions at 80% of sites, with the magnitude of recovery strongly related to the magnitude of pre-removal impacts. These data suggest that broadly, small dams negatively affect stream DO, and the extent of effects are modulated by impoundment geometry and watershed characteristics. These results may help practitioners to prioritize restoration efforts at those sites where small dams are having outsized impacts, and therefore where the greatest water quality benefits may occur.

This study aims to establish the baseline situation of avian diversity and abundance on various land uses including the landfill at Gujranwala in northeastern Punjab, Pakistan, and understanding the impact of urban solid waste in changing bird behavior. Field observations in a variety of land uses (agriculture, forest, lake, urban and landfill) in summer 2018 using the point count method for bird census determined the baseline for 56 species (birds/10 min) indicating a significant change in native avian composition. PCA analysis showed four clusters based on the nature of habitat and species behavior. Agriculture land was found to be the highest (H'= 3.394) and landfill the lowest (H'= 1.414) in biodiversity. However, landfill site registered the most number of birds (>9000). Among twenty species recorded at the landfill, four species viz., house crow, common myna, grey-throated martin and bank myna, recorded >95% of the total population of birds. Species evenness was the highest for lake site (E= 0.938) indicating the most balanced type of ecosystem. Sparrows were found only in urban areas. Two opportunist species (house crow and common myna) were found to be the most successful in exploiting available resources. Foraging of birds in layers with aggressive species feeding first and development of new learning mechanisms pointed to the change in bird behavior at the landfill. This work highlights the need for a new research field 'Landfill Ecology' to study the impact of landfill on biota including avian, in a time when biodiversity loss is the hottest global issue.

Late Pleistocene Mountain Glaciation in the Lake Bonneville Basin	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											The record of the last Pleistocene glaciation in the Lake Bonneville basin has been known for decades and has improved significantly due to expanded mapping and geologic dating efforts. Although ice occupied only a small portion of the basin and constituted a small component of the lake water budget, the pattern of glaciation in space and time can be combined with the stratigraphic record from Lake Bonneville to improve the understanding of regional climate change during and after the last glaciation. Mountain glaciers were most abundant in the eastern/Rocky Mountain sector of the basin, with the vast majority of ice volume concentrated in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains. Here, the geomorphic record of the last glaciation is well preserved, stratigraphic observations of sediments of Lake Bonneville and valley glaciers are documented, and cosmogenic Be-10 exposure ages of several moraines based on new production models of in situ (10) Be are reported. Terminal moraines here, and in the western sector of the basin, were occupied near the time of the Bonneville highstand at 18 ka and subsequently abandoned while the lake continued to overflow. This constitutes a significant revision to initial reports of Be-10 exposure ages based on earlier production rate models, which suggest that ice retreat corresponded to the fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline. Still, temporal correspondence of the Lake Bonneville highstand and glacier maxima support the previously proposed model that climate during the lake highstand was favorable for maxima of both glaciers and lakes. The onset of ice retreat while the lake overflowed, however, suggests warming in the basin at c. 18 ka but with sufficient precipitation to sustain a positive water budget of Lake Bonneville.																			0928-2025		978-0-444-63594-5; 978-0-444-63590-7				2016	20						462	503		10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00017-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00017-2													WOS:000409050100019
J	Rosenthal, E; Guttman, J; Sabel, R; Möller, P				Rosenthal, Eliahu; Guttman, Joseph; Sabel, Robbie; Moeller, Peter			Limiting hydrochemical factors for sustainability of water resources: The Cisjordanian experience	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												In Cisjordan, surface- and groundwater flow are either towards the Jordan Valley-Dead Sea-Arava Valley (the Rift) or the Mediterranean Sea. Due to Upstream exploitation by riparians to the Jordan River, the historical annual flow, which fluctuated between 250 and 1100 Mm(3), has declined to a mere 100-200 Mm(3). The remaining flow south of Lake Kinneret is highly polluted and heavily loaded with salts. Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) is one of the major water resources in the area. Annually, between 200 and 700 Mm(3) reach the Lake as surface and groundwater flow. The relatively high salinity of the Lake is caused by thermomineral water discharging from springs and seepages located onshore and on the bottom of the Lake. The main factors causing deterioration of the groundwater quality in the Rift are of geogenic character. These are different types of brines, whose outflow and penetration into freshwater aquifers was triggered by overpumpage. Contemporary encroachment of seawater caused by intensive water exploitation in the Coastal Plain is manageable and reversible. However, due to lack of hydrogeological evidence, no such statement can be made about the circulation of seawater beneath the Coastal Plain and into the deep-seated Yarkon-Taninim aquifer or the upflow of brines in the Rift. The flow regimes of the different brine bodies could not be elucidated. Whether each such brine-body flows by its particular hydrological regime or whether the movement of the different bodies is intradependent or interdependent with the regional movement of fresh groundwater, remain open questions. Therefore, sustainable development of groundwater resources is clearly dependent on the elucidation of the relationship between changes in the pressure of the brine with depth and its relationship to the overlying freshwater. The average total annual recharge of all water sources in Cisjordan is 1820 Mm(3), which means that the total production of water must be managed within the limits of this annual volume. During drought years, total groundwater extraction exceeds the safe yield, causing drastic lowering of water levels and upflow of saline waters from greater depths. Because of the structural complexity of aquifers and hydrochemical variability of the numerous groundwater bodies, new hydrochemical methods have been developed for the identification of groundwater bodies and for the elucidation of their origins. These methods combine macrochemical, microchemical, and isotopic evidences. By combining distribution patterns of rare earths, yttrium and stable isotopes, a complete picture of catchment lithology and the altitude and latitude of precipitation could be obtained. The area west of the Jordan River is characterized by the occurrence of transboundary surface- and groundwater basins in which fresh and saline water and brines flow across political borders between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It is very difficult to assess separately the annual safe yield of water resources for each of the two national entities. Neither country may dispose independently of its waters and is usually at the mercy of the other riparian. There is as yet no general multilateral international treaty in force allocating the water resources of international watercourses. At present there are two rules for the management of the waters of an international drainage basin-the rule of Equitable Distribution, and the obligation Not to Cause Significant Harm. The rules of equitable distribution have tended to focus on the issue of quantities of water rather than on quality of water, which is really relevant to the issue of equitable distribution. Future negotiations on the uses of the basin will need to deal with issues of characteristic salinities and geochemical features and on their impact on equitable sharing of water resources.

Surface and subsurface conceptual model of an arid environment with respect to mid- and late Holocene climate changes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The water demand in arid regions is commonly covered by groundwater resources that date back to more humid periods of the Pleistocene and Holocene. Within the investigated arid part of SE Saudi-Arabia information about climate, groundwater levels, and pumping rates are only available for regions where groundwater extractions occur at present-day. For the prediction of the impact of long-term climate changes on groundwater resources an understanding of the hydrogeological and hydrological past and the development of the aquifers is necessary. Therefore, all available information about hydrology and hydrogeology for the past 10,000 years BP were collected and compiled to a conceptual model of the aquifer development on the Arabian Peninsula since the last Ice-Age. The climatic history was displayed by changes in precipitation, temperature and recharge during the mid-S and late Holocene. The hydrogeological development is described by groundwater ages, sea level fluctuations, movement of the coastline, and the development of sabkhas. The most sensitive parameter to describe the development of aquifer system is recharge. Present-day recharge was calculated with the hydrological model system HEC-HMS accounting for current precipitation, temperature, wind, soil types, and geomorphology. With respect to changes in precipitation and temperature over the past 10,000 years the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge was calculated using empirical equations valid for semi-arid and arid settings. Further inflow into the groundwater system results from surface water infiltration in wadi beds, while natural outflow from the groundwater system occurs by discharge to the Gulf, evaporation from sabkhas, and spring discharge. Backward predictions can be verified by sedimentological observations of palaeo-river systems and lakes indicating that groundwater levels reached temporarily the surface under wetter climate conditions and C-14 groundwater ages displaying groundwater residence times.

A high resolution multi-proxy record of pronounced recent environmental change at Baker Lake, Nunavut	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Arctic aquatic systems are considered to be especially sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, which can have cascading effects on biological communities as aquatic food-web structure is altered. Bio-indicators that respond to major limnological changes can be used to detect and infer major environmental change, such as climate warming, with the use of paleolimnological techniques. A multi-proxy approach was used to quantify recent environmental changes at Baker Lake, Nunavut, Arctic Canada. Analyses of fossilized remains of chironomids and diatoms were conducted on a sediment core of 20 cm in length sampled at 0.5-cm intervals. A new surface sediment training set of subfossil chironomid assemblages from 65 lakes across the eastern Canadian Arctic generated a robust (r (jack) (2) = 0.79) surface water paleotemperature transfer function. The transfer function was applied to stratigraphic intervals from the Baker Lake sediment core to generate a paleotemperature reconstruction of sub-decadal resolution. The surface water temperature reconstruction inferred a 2A degrees C increase in mid-summer surface water temperature for Baker Lake over the last 60 years, which was corroborated by the local instrumental record spanning the period of 1950-2007 AD. The chironomid record shows a recent decline of several cold-water taxa and appearance of warm-water indicators. This shift in community structure began circa 1906 AD, and intensified after 1940 AD. The corresponding fossil diatom record showed an increase in small planktonic Cyclotella taxa over the past 60 years, intensifying in the last 5 years, which also suggests a warmer climate and longer ice-free periods. The shifts in the diatom assemblages began later than the shifts in the chironomid assemblages, and were of lower magnitude, reflecting differences in the mechanisms in which these two indicators respond to environmental change.					; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; Medeiros, Andrew/0000-0002-7743-2560													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2012	47	4					661	676		10.1007/s10933-012-9589-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9589-2													WOS:000302803700009

RESOLVING ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THROUGH A HOLISTIC VISION OF REGIONAL URBAN PLANNING	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												In the past the Hunedoara county mainly focused on mining and iron and steel works, was one of the most industrialised in Romania. After the industry crashed in 1989 the social, economic and ecologic problems arose. Using a holistic approach it was attempted to resolve the problem through the Hunedoara County Development Plans - developed by the Research Centre for Sustainable Development, 'Politehnica' University of Timisoara whose results are presented in the current article. The study was carried out through the analysis of the current situation on a multitude of layers, which revealed an intimate relation between the massive depopulation (over 50% in the rural area), the current state of the roads and utilities infrastructure, natural and built reservations and the tourism potential. The county only viable economical development solution is based on tourism. To be able to set it into motion it is necessary to develop the infrastructure which would serve it, be it transportation (county or communal roars) or utilities (sewage, water, electricity, storage lakes, wind farms, etc.), always bearing in mind to doze the interventions as not to alter areas with tourism potential or cultural value. Taking into consideration the characteristics of each area local tourism takes form (winter, hiking, rural-ecologic, ecumenical, agricultural) which needs a specific approach. Following a complete analysis of all layers, individually and in relation to one another, and the drafting of a development strategy with the prioritisation of the intervention measures a judicious land use is attained bearing in mind the accomplishment of a balance between the 3 parameters of sustainable development					Branea, Ana-Maria/U-9009-2017	Branea, Ana-Maria/0000-0001-8081-0158													1311-5065						2012	13	4					2249	2256																WOS:000313926400023

Received wisdom attributes the catastrophe to droughts and/or climate change, but the authors identify more than 40 dams in this small basin as the singular most likely cause, which has sprung up since 1995. The paper adds further evidence by studying droughts through a modelling strategy comprising the following: (i) use the standardised precipitation index (SPI) to map SPI on one, three, six and nine-month timescales with 21 years of recorded data; (ii) derive duration and severity (DS) values at 55 observation stations; (iii) derive reliability, resilience, and vulnerability (RRV) indicators using DS; (iv) aggregate the subsequent five maps (DS + RRV) for the four timescales using a particle swarm optimisation algorithm to compact their inherent information. The aggregated results show: (i) one-month timescale: wet and dry zones are demarcated by an axis running along northwest-southeast of the basin; (ii) three-month timescale: the aforementioned behaviour prevails, but the axis runs along east-west; (iii) higher timescales: the wet and dry zones flip. The overall results show that droughts are natural features of the basin but not catastrophic.

It turned up that the natural and spacial carcass of the North Depression pot hole was the particular scenario for the development of territorial and spacial organization of settlements. The carcass is also the basis for the development of the museum exposition. Museum and touristic routes can be created following ancient trade routes, along which the alans created their settlements. The alans animated the nature and created a network of sacred objects. It can be represented in the form of a carcass structure consisting of sacral objects (such as sacred mountains, trees, groves, springs, lakes, separate stones, caves etc.). The sacred objects and the routes to them formed sacred topography of Alania. They can be used as the centerpieces of the museum and tourist routes. The alani settlements situated along the roads can be the main elements of expositions. Revealing and preserving spacial structure and historic connections between the objects of the main exposition should be the basis of our conception of musefication of the historic and cultural landscape of Medieval Alania. This decision will let us demonstrate the unique objects of region's cultural legacy including the historic landscape in the best possible way.

We studied the use of the two habitat types, and focused on the profitability of Brine Shrimp Artemia salina, prey species in hypersaline lagoons for Dunlins Calidris alpina, Curlew Sandpipers Calidris ferruginea and Broad-billed Sandpipers Limicola falcinellus (although the latter was abundant in the brackish habitat only). Colour-marked Dunlins restricted feeding to the lagoon type in which they were initially captured. Dunlins and Curlew Sandpipers fed in areas where Brine Shrimps were of average size (0.23-0.34 mg AFDM). Artemia intake may be restricted by the visual foraging mode, as during rain and twilight pecking rates decreased to 45.9-76.8% of values measured during dry periods in full daylight. Feeding activities were higher in hypersaline than in brackish lagoon (84.6 and 69.0%, respectively). Broad-billed Sandpipers feeding on Artemia had longer handling times (0.87 s prey(-1)) than Dunlins and Curlew Sandpipers (0.58 and 0.54 s prey(-1)), which performed surface tension transport (STT) of prey in their pointed, thin bills. There were no differences in body mass increases in Dunlins in hypersaline and brackish lagoons. In Broad-billed Sandpipers, catching results suggest an increase in body mass in the brackish lagoon only. Supported by intake rate-based calculations of potential mass gain rates, we conclude that Brine Shrimp can form a profitable prey for Dunlins and for Curlew Sandpipers, but apparently not for Broad-billed Sandpipers.					; Verkuil, Yvonne/ABH-4507-2020	Chernichko, Josef/0000-0003-1191-1902; Verkuil, Yvonne/0000-0001-7080-3026													0373-2266	2213-1175				SPR	2003	91	1					71	83																WOS:000186946400007

WATER POLICY												Balancing water demands with available supplies on a scale that enables sustainable water use constitutes a complex governance challenge. Water managers face the daunting task of balancing water demands amidst variable supplies impacted by climate change and unsustainable extraction leading to drying lakes, depleted rivers, and shrinking aquifers. Traditionally, water managers have focused on bolstering water supplies to meet rising demands. However, this strategy is failing in many regions because of exorbitant costs, alongside environmental, legal, and political obstacles. Despite growing focus, no single solution ensures sustainable water use. Among governance options, capping water extractions holds theoretical promise, but evidence of their efficacy is limited and inconsistent due to shortcomings in their implementation, as detailed in this study. Our paper contributes to the literature on water governance by organizing empirical evidence of different types of caps. We developed a database to analyze 47 cases spanning 14 countries utilizing various types of caps (e.g., volumetric, water level limit, and moratorium) applied to different sources of water (e.g., aquifers, lakes, and rivers). We assess their efficacy in terms of enforceability, adaptability, and performance. We illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of capping as a water management strategy and offer recommendations to enhance its effectiveness.					; Richter, Brian/IWK-6306-2023	Novak, Delaney/0009-0000-8768-2056; Diment, Louis/0009-0003-9817-1931; 													1366-7017	1996-9759				JAN	2024	27	1					17	39		10.2166/wp.2024.071	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2024.071		NOV 2024											WOS:001361300700001

Cyanotoxins can be transported to nearby crops and fields during irrigation and may pose a risk to animal health through water sources. Spatial and temporal variations in cyanotoxin concentrations have been reported for large freshwater sources such as lakes and reservoirs, but there are fewer studies on smaller agricultural surface water bodies. To determine whether spatiotemporal patterns of the cyanotoxin microcystin occurred in agricultural waters used for crop irrigation and livestock watering, three agricultural ponds on working farms in Georgia, USA, were sampled monthly within a fixed spatial grid over a 17-month period. Microcystin concentrations, which ranged between 0.04 and 743.75 ppb, were determined using microcystin-ADDA ELISA kits. Temporal stability was assessed using mean relative differences between microcystin concentrations at each location and averaged concentrations across ponds on each sampling date. There were locations or zones in all three ponds that were consistently higher or lower than the average daily microcystin concentrations throughout the year, with the highest microcystin concentrations occurring in winter. Additionally, microcystin patterns were strongly correlated with the patterns of chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and turbidity. The results of this work showed that consistent spatiotemporal patterns in cyanotoxins can occur in produce irrigation and livestock watering ponds, and this should be accounted for when developing agricultural water monitoring programs.					; Coffin, Alisa/AAD-4539-2019; Pachepsky, Yakov/H-7236-2019; Stocker, Matthew/KIG-0922-2024	Wolny, Jennifer L./0000-0002-3556-5015; Dunn, Laurel/0000-0003-0786-5253; Widmer, Andrew/0000-0002-1394-7792; Pachepsky, Yakov/0000-0003-0232-6090														2072-6651				NOV	2024	16	11							482	10.3390/toxins16110482	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins16110482								39591237					WOS:001366500500001

This transition was characterized by an increase in temperature and precipitation, added river runoff volume, increased lake water surface elevation and area, and elevated groundwater table. However, some literatures showed that the Hotan River has presented a contrary situation, i.e. the runoff decreased, whereas temperature and precipitation increased. In order to discover the nonlinear runoff trend and its causes in the Hotan River, based on the related data from hydrological stations, ground and air sounding meteorological stations, this study applied a comprehensive method combing correlation analysis, wavelet analysis and regression analysis to investigate the runoff change in the Hotan River with its relevant climatic factors over the past decades. The main findings are: (a) the hydrological process of the Hotan River is a nonlinear system, with a periodicity of 24 year cycle, and it shows different nonlinear trends at different time scales; (b) the data from the ground meteorological stations in the Hotan area shows a false appearance that there is almost no correlation between runoff and temperature, and a little negative correlation between runoff and precipitation; (c) but the data from air sounding meteorological stations shows the truth that there is a close relation between the runoff in the Hotan River and the 0A degrees C level height in summer on the north slope of Kunlun Mountains. The two variables present a same periodicity, i.e. 24-year cycle, having similar nonlinear trends and significant correlations at different time scales.					chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020; Xu, Jianhua/B-1062-2009	Xu, Jianhua/0000-0001-6134-4833													1436-3240					FEB	2011	25	2					223	233		10.1007/s00477-010-0433-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-010-0433-9													WOS:000286469000008

A thermal bar is a narrow zone in a lake in temperate latitudes where maximum-density waters sink from the surface to the bottom. Two different turbulence models are compared: the algebraic model of Holland P. R. et al. [1] and the two-equation k-omega model of Wilcox D.C. [2]. The two-parameter model of turbulence developed by D.C. Wilcox consists of equations for turbulence kinetic energy (k) and specific dissipation rate (omega). The mathematical model which includes the Coriolis force due to the Earth's rotation, is written in the Boussinesq approximation with the continuity, momentum, energy, and salinity equations. The Chen-Millero equation [8], adopted by UNESCO, was taken as the equation of state. The formulated problem is solved by the finite volume method. The numerical algorithm for finding the flow and temperature fields is based on the Crank-Nicholson difference scheme. The convective terms in the equations are approximated by a second-order upstream QUICK scheme [10]. To calculate the velocity and pressure fields, the SIMPLED procedure for buoyant flows [11], which is a modification of the well-known Patankar's SIMPLE method [9], has been developed. The systems of grid equations at each time step are solved by the under-relaxation method or N.I. Buleev's explicit method [12]. The turbulence models were applied to predict the evolution of the spring thermal bar in Kamloops Lake. The numerical experiments have shown that the application of the k-omega turbulence model leads to new effects in the thermal bar evolution.

J	Sioutas, M; Szilagyi, W; Keul, A				Sioutas, Michalis; Szilagyi, Wade; Keul, Alexander			Waterspout outbreaks over areas of Europe and North America: Environment and predictability	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Waterspout outbreak occurrences are examined for the areas of the Aegean and Ionian Seas, Eastern Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe and the Great Lakes of North America. Notable outbreaks included a series of 13 waterspouts on September 5, 2002, and 25 plus waterspouts on September 21, 2006 off the Cretan north coast in the Aegean Sea. Two outbreak days with 10 waterspouts each, occurred on August 11 and 13, 2006 over the Baltic Sea. During the fall of 2003 an outbreak produced about 66 waterspouts during a week over the Great Lakes of North America. A preliminary climatology of waterspout outbreak occurrences showed August as the most active month for the Baltic Sea and the Great Lakes and September for the Aegean and Ionian Seas; a feature primary related to the warmest sea surface temperatures during these months. Synoptic data indicated that a closed low (CLOSED) type pattern prevailed during waterspout outbreaks over the Baltic and the Aegean and Ionian Seas and a longwave (LW) type over the Great Lakes. Thermodynamic, wind and moisture data indicated a marginally unstable environment for most waterspout outbreaks. A steep thermal gradient between the water surface and lowest layers proved to be a primary factor for Great Lakes waterspout outbreak occurrences. For the Baltic Sea, the primary factors were balanced between the thermal contrast in the lowest layers and the total positive buoyancy. For the Aegean and Ionian Seas, positive buoyancy was the dominant factor. Selected waterspout outbreak case studies are investigated in order to present specific synoptic, thermodynamic features and predictability for the three areas. The Szilagyi waterspout nomogram, which is used as a forecasting tool, was applied together with the Szilagyi waterspout index (SWI) and found to be strongly correlated with outbreak occurrences for the three geographical areas.

It is endemic to a rheocrenic spring in Lake Posta Fibreno (Frosinone, Italy). In this study we examined the silk glands as well as the case organization and silk lining in both the larva and the pupa by means of light and scanning electron microscope. The silk glands are long, folded 4 times and occupy most of the body cavity. The case of the 5(th) instar larva is 7 mm long, conical, slightly curved and made of irregularly arranged pebbles of different sizes. The anterior opening is oblique and surrounded by larger pebbles. The posterior end is rounded and closed by a membrane with an irregular hole. The silk lining is made of layers of intersecting threads 4 mu m thick. The pupal case, about 10 mm long, has a wide anterior opening covered by an extended silk plug and partially attached to a large, flat pebble. The posterior silk plugging is a dense membrane with 3 small holes. Examination of the silk organization in this species showed that the case lining is made of densely woven threads arranged in superimposed layers.

POLLEN AND CHARCOAL ANALYSES AND THEIR RELATION TO HUMAN IMPACT	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												Pollen and charcoal analyses were made on samples from the annually laminated sediment of Lake Ahvenainen, southern Finland, both the pollen percentages and absolute deposition values being studied. Man apparently cleared the forests in Neolithic times, between .apprx. 3500-2600 B.C. The first signs of agriculture, in the samples fall in the Bronze Age (about 1450-900 B.C.). From the pre-Roman Iron Age onwards (.apprx. 550 B.C.-), systematic clearance with regular burn-beating cultivation took place in the area, and the land under cereal and fiber-plant crops increased. A recent decline in human influence has resulted in regeneration of the forests (A.D. 1925-). The first cultivation of rye is dated to 40 B.C. and that of flax to A.D. 415. Hemp was cultivated some 1000 yr before the introduction of flax. Burning-over was important throughout the Iron Age and medieval times. In the late 1700s woodland covered only a small part of the region. It was not possible to determine accurately the beginning of field cultivation by pollen analysis. The rhythmical successions in the vegetation caused by rotational burning-over were evident only in pollen influx diagrams constructed from analyses of contiguous subsamples. The intervals between burning-over decreased from .apprx. 75-125 yr in the older Iron Age to 50-80 yr in the 13/14th century, and to 15-20 yr at the beginning of the 18th century.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1978	15	3					177	208																WOS:A1978FY35800007
J	Sutton, TM; Edenfield, LE				Sutton, Trent M.; Edenfield, Lorena E.			Stock Characteristics of Humpback Whitefish and Least Cisco in the Chatanika River, Alaska	ARCTIC												Overharvest of humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschian) and least cisco (C. sardinella) in the Chatanika River, Alaska, during the late 1980s led to collapsed stocks and closure of the fishery. We evaluated the stock characteristics of these two species to determine the extent of recovery. A total of 3207 humpback whitefish and 2766 least cisco were captured during their fall spawning migration in 2008. Humpback whitefish ranged from 188 to 583 mm in fork length (FL) and encompassed ages 5 to 29 years, while least cisco ranged from 215 to 425 mm in FL and their ages ranged from 3 to 14 years. Patterns,in growth and length-at-age were similar for both species, and annual mortality rates were 31% for humpback whitefish (age 11 and older) and 44% for least cisco (age 9 and older). Population attributes were within the ranges observed for other North American stocks of humpback whitefish and least cisco. Although the humpback whitefish in the Chatanika River have stock attributes that are consistent with low exploitation and this species appears to have recovered, the least cisco in the river still exhibit many attributes that suggest the cisco stock has not fully recovered. The results of this study indicate that the current allowable harvest limit of 2000 whitefish is cautious and appears to be sustainable.

These xenoliths occur in the posterosional Honolulu Volcanics Series lavas and represent some of the deepest samples from the oceanic mantle lithosphere. Our study shows that the Salt Lake Crater pyroxenites represent high pressure (> 20 kb) accumulates from melts similar (but not identical) to the erupted Honolulu Volcanics, and unlike MORB or E-MORB-type melts. All clinopyroxene-garnet mineral pairs in these xenoliths show, within error, zero-age Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systematics. These pyroxenites have relatively radiogenic Hf isotope compositions (for a given Nd) and define a distinct steep slope (3.3) in epsilon(Hf)epsilon(Nd) isotope space, similar to the Honolulu Volcanics but unlike other ocean island basalts (OIB). These compositions require an end-member component that falls above the OIB array in Nd-Hf space. This component is different than present-day MORB-mantle and it is best explained by an old depleted oceanic lithosphere. We suggest that this depleted component most likely represents a recycled depleted lithosphere that is intrinsic to the Hawaiian plume. In this respect, the Hawaiian plume is sampling both the enriched portion of a subducted oceanic crust (basalt and sediments) as well as the depleted lithospheric portion of it. This suggests that, at least for Hawaii, the whole subducted oceanic slab package has retained its integrity during subduction and subsequent mixing and storage in the mantle, probably in the order of a billion years, and that the plume is sampling the full range of these compositions.

J	Fox, GA; MacCluskie, MC; Brook, RW				Fox, GA; MacCluskie, MC; Brook, RW			Are current contaminant concentrations in eggs and breeding female Lesser Scaup of concern?	CONDOR												One of the proposed explanations for the recent continental decline in Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) populations is that females experience lower survival or reproduction resulting from exposure to contaminants in their diet of exotic bivalves during migration and over winter. In 1999, we collected eggs and females from five sites in the boreal forest of Canada and Alaska and four sites in Canadian parkland. We analyzed eggs from 60 clutches and ten nesting females for toxic metals, selenium, 19 pesticides and other organochlorines, and 43 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The highest organochlorine concentration we measured was 1.5 mug g(-1) ww of DDE in eggs. The highest mercury concentration was 1.8 mug g(-1) dw in liver. The highest cadmium concentration was 6.2 mug g(-1) dw in kidney. The highest selenium concentrations measured were 1.6 mug g(-1) ww in eggs, and 5.3 mug g(-1) dw in liver. All are well below thresholds known to cause embryotoxic and other effects in other bird species. Though sample sizes were small and did not include the entire breeding range or nonbreeders, our results provide no evidence to support the hypothesis of contaminant-induced effects on egg hatchability and female health. However, recently published concentrations of selenium in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and Asian clams (Potamocorbula amurensis), predominant foods on staging areas, are sufficient to induce other sublethal effects, and possibly mortality if eaten by scaup for extended periods.																			0010-5422					FEB	2005	107	1					50	61		10.1650/7626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7626													WOS:000226960300005
J	Oswald, WW; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM				Oswald, WW; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM			Late Quaternary vegetational history of the Howard Pass area, northwestern Alaska	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Palynological records from Tukuto and Etivlik Lakes contribute to an improved understanding of the late Quaternary history of vegetation in the Howard Pass area of northern Alaska. During the Itkillik II glaciation (24-14 ka BP), the vegetation of the western Arctic Foothills was sparse, xeric tundra, as evidenced by taxa indicative of dry,rocky substrates (e.g., Selaginella rupestris (L.) Spring, Chenopodiaceae, and Encalypta cf. rhaptocarpa) and very low pollen accumulation rates in this interval of the 30-ka-old Tukuto Lake record. Mesic tundra dominated by non-Sphagnum (Bryidae) mosses, Cyperaceae, and Salix species expanded near Tukuto Lake during the late-glacial period, followed by the establishment of Sphagnum moss and increased shrub cover at ca. 10 ka EP. Landscapes around both lakes supported stands of Populus cf. balsamifera during the early Holocene, and Alnus crispa expanded in the Howard Pass area during the middle Holocene. Local Variation in plant communities is illustrated by the comparison of the Tukuto and Etivlik pollen records. During the early Holocene, Populus cf. balsamifera was more common near Etivlik Lake than Tukuto Lake, and Juniperus cf. communis was present only in the vicinity of Etivlik Lake. Throughout the middle to late Holocene, Sphagnum, mesic tundra shrubs (Betula nana L., Salix, and Ericaceae species), and minor herbaceous taxa (e.g., Rubus chamaemorus L., Thalictrum, and Caryophyllaceae) were more prevalent at Tukuto Lake than at Etivlik Lake. These differences are likely related to the influence of local landform and soil characteristics near the two sites.																			0008-4026					APR	1999	77	4					570	581		10.1139/b99-027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b99-027													WOS:000083318000012

A conceptual framework to disentangle land use and climate change impacts on water balance components and sediment yield	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Individual and combined impacts of land use and climate change on water resources in a river basin cannot be easily categorized due to feedback effects. These impacts should be assessed separately to determine the dominant role of land use and/or climate change affecting planning and management of natural resources. In this study, a conceptual framework is proposed to disentangle individual as well as combined impacts of land use and climate changes on hydrology of the Betwa River basin in central India. Land use maps of the years 2013 (classified) and 2040 (simulated) were used as inputs in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the land use change impact study. Downscaled and bias-corrected CMIP5 GCM data was firstly evaluated using observed station data, and then used in the SWAT model for simulation of basin hydrology over five periods of time, i.e., baseline (1986-2005), horizon 2039 (2020-2039), horizon 2059 (2040-2059), horizon 2079 (2060-2079), and horizon 2099 (2080-2099). The study reveals that the impact of climate change dominates effects on water resources in the future, especially due to increased precipitation. Changes in dense forest, agriculture and waterbody induce positive responses; nevertheless, changes in degraded forest and barren land induce negative responses to the changes in hydrology of the Betwa basin. The proposed conceptual framework can disentangle individual and combined impacts of land use change and climate change on basin hydrology. Thus, it can be utilized as an important tool for sustainable river basin management.

Contribution and Performance of Stocked Walleyes in the Recovery of the Red Lakes, Minnesota, Fishery	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Oxytetracycline (OTC) marking and genetic assignment techniques were used to evaluate the contribution and performance of Walleye Sander vitreus fry stocked to accelerate the recovery of a recruitment-overfished population in the Red Lakes, Minnesota. Three stockings of OTC-marked fry from an egg source on the Pike River were conducted at densities of 274 to 358 fry/ha to expedite the recovery of the spawning stock in which the adult female biomass had fallen below 0.5 kg/ha for 10 consecutive years. Two additional stockings of OTC-marked fry from an egg source on a Red Lakes tributary were then conducted at 33 and 87 fry/ha to help quantify natural reproduction as the spawning stock recovered. Subsequent inspection of fish from seine and gill-net samples indicated that Pike River fish composed 50% to 94% of the stocked year-classes and that the stocked year-classes were three of the strongest in the past 25 years. The Pike River fish survived, grew, and matured at rates similar to the native fish, contributing to an increase in adult female biomass ranging from 2.5 to 8.0 kg/ha. Natural reproduction also increased from a range of 8-120 fry/ha to a range of 199-908 fry/ha, with 49% to 53% Pike River ancestry. For the first 2 years after maturation of the first stocked year-class, however, Pike River ancestry was 13-31 percentage points below what was expected from the relative abundance of Pike River adults in the population. The proportion of Pike River adults present on the tributary spawning runs was also initially below expectations. Both spawning participation and success of Pike River adults increased in successive years, and the stocked fry were judged to have accelerated the recovery of the population to a sustainable and fishable status without the need for additional stocking.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	4					828	843		10.1080/02755947.2016.1167143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1167143													WOS:000381683600012
J	He, C; Droppo, I				He, Cheng; Droppo, Ian			Numerical modeling of fine particle plume transport in a large lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A new concept of Zebra mussel control for power plants is to release Nalco molluscicide H-130 M during intake of cooling water to deactivate the mussels, followed by releasing fine clay to absorb the remaining molluscicide prior to discharge. To predict the fate and impact of a low concentration fine particle plume upon its release to receiving waters, a three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic and a mud transport model were employed under various wind conditions and different particle settling speeds. The hydrodynamic model was verified against flow velocity vertical profiles measured by two ADCPs (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers) deployed in the study region during the late fall. Good agreement between the measured and simulated alongshore current vertical profile at the near shore location (1 km) was achieved, however the model had difficulty in replicating the measured offshore current in the near shore region and the velocity vertical profile 5 km offshore. A simplified computational solution using an extended domain of receiving waters with a closed boundary was proposed in this study. Five particle plume transport scenarios were examined with the 3D mud transport model. Generally, in spite of very strong offshore discharge flow, the particle plumes do not extend more than 2 km away from the shoreline in all tested scenarios. The numerical modeling method used in this study can be applied to solve similar coastal zone transport problems if the flow is unstratified and mainly travels along and close to shore.

A LONG-TERM SUCCESSIONAL MODEL OF THE EUTROPHICATION	BOTANIKAI KOZLEMENYEK-BOTANICAL PUBLICATIONS												The less eutrophic part of the largest shallow lake of Central Europe (Lake Balaton, Hungary) was studied in the summers of 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1982. About 20,000 data of the main plankton-groups were analyzed with respect to eutrophication. Variables (29) were tested by 48 trophic scales or features described in the past 35 yr based on data of about 500 lakes located mainly in the temperate zone. The studied variables differed as to the 1st indication of the eutrophic state, their successive increases led to outlining a long-term eutrophication model of this area of the lake as follows: as a 1st effect of the increasing loading with nutrients, the community structure changed (1965-1972). Then the primary production (1973-1975), and the algal numbers (1974-1976) increased serving as a better nutrient supply for the zooplankton. Simultaneously with the increase in algal numbers the zooplankton variables also increased. A 10-fold increase in algal numbers was observed in 1978-1979. Bacterial variables showed an increase after the increase in phytoplankton biomass, but except for the bacterial generation time, remained within oligo-mesotrophic, mesotrophic levels. The presumably important role of the bottom fauna and fishes in the recycling of nutrients in Lake Balaton is discussed.

A critical factor is the reliability of the sedimentary chronologies. Hence, to better understand the potential long-term consequences of climatic warming or cooling for tropical arid regions we compared a pollen record from the annually-laminated sediments of a crater lake in Myanmar with ice core records of the Siberian High, both of which have an annual resolution. Our findings reveal that over the past 8000 years, the Myanmar region experienced six significant drought events, three of which coincided precisely with intensifications of the Siberian High-pressure system. Furthermore, five out of these six events were synchronous with the North Atlantic Bond events within the limit of the dating uncertainties. Conversely, warm periods were associated with increased precipitation along with relatively short-lived drought events. Our findings suggest that regardless of the El Nino intensity, a cooling trend in the Northern Hemisphere may result in persistent extreme drought conditions in arid tropical regions. Therefore, as well as the environmental implications of global warming, it is also important to address the potential hazards associated with cooling, especially in arid tropical regions. To facilitate effective disaster management and to develop strategies for climate change mitigation, it is crucial to better understand the complex relationship between temperature fluctuations and drought. Overall, our findings are a reminder of the importance of not ignoring the potential disasters that may arise from cooling trends while focusing exclusively on warming.

J	Ramrath, A; Zolitschka, B; Wulf, S; Negendank, JFW				Ramrath, A; Zolitschka, B; Wulf, S; Negendank, JFW			Late Pleistocene climatic variations as recorded in two Italian maar lakes (Lago di Mezzano, Lago Grande di Monticchio)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment profiles from two maar lakes, Lago di Mezzano (central Italy) and Lago Grande di Monticchio (southern Italy), were investigated with respect to their minerogenic and biogenic sediment accumulation rates for a time window spanning the final 20,000 yr of the last glaciation. The chronological framework is provided by calibrated radiocarbon ages, varve counting, calculation of sedimentation rates and tephrochronology. In the time slice between 34,000 and 14,000 cal BP periods of increased minerogenic input are observed in both lacustrine records, interrupted by periods of low minerogenic input. These cyclic variations have an average recurrence time of 1785 yr for Lago di Mezzano and 2875 yr for Lago Grande di Monticchio, comparing well with marine and ice core data. Explanations for these pulses of increased minerogenic sedimentation include enhanced erosion and runoff. The higher precipitation/evaporation ratio required for this interpretation was possibly restricted to winter months as earlier published pollen analyses on sediments from Lago Grande di Monticchio show a contemporary development of steppe vegetation, an indicator for cool/dry climatic conditions. This may be connected with a southward shift of the westerlies and a reinforced jet stream. Agreement of lacustrine data from Italy with late Pleistocene glacial events in central Italy, with events recorded in marine archives from the North Atlantic (Heinrich events) and with oxygen isotope data from Greenland ice cores is interpreted as evidence for the Late Pleistocene climate in Europe being influenced by North Atlantic climatic forcing which may be related to Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles.

Trends in temperature, Secchi depth, and dissolved oxygen depletion rates in the central basin of Lake Erie, 1983-2002	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined temperature trends in a 20-year set of monitoring records collected at multiple deep-water stations in the central basin of Lake Erie. Data collected were statistically corrected ("deseasonalized") to remove biases resulting from irregular sampling intervals within years. Depth-integrated summer temperature has increased by an average (+/- SE) of 0.037 +/- 0.01 degrees C per year. An observed reduction of Secchi depth (SD) by 7 +/- 3 cm/y seems to be unrelated to variation in either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Midsummer midbasin SD values varied widely between 4 and 10 m, possibly depending on whether phytoplankton were concentrated in the epilimnion (giving shallow SD), or whether phytoplankton had settled out of the epilimnion into the lower layers, giving deeper SD values. Hypolimnetic volume-corrected oxygen depletion (HVOD) rates have also been highly variable, ranging from 2.68 to 4.72 mg/L/mo. These rates are sensitive to production of oxygen in the thermocline and hypolimnion by photosynthetically active phytoplankton that have settled from the epilimnion. The HVOD rate in any year was correlated with the previous year's TP loading into Lake Erie. Since TP loading trends largely reflect the consequences of improving water treatment through the 1980s and increasing contributions from tributary run-off sediments through the 1990s, there is little direct evidence to suggest that the appearance of dreissenids has directly influenced hypolimnial oxygen depletion rates in the central basin. The observation that central-basin HVOD tracked the reductions in TP loadings through the 1980s may be the first affirmation that central basin hypolinmetic oxygen dynamics can be regulated by phosphorus inputs. This implies that TP loads must continue to be regulated if we wish to minimize oxygen depletion rates as a strategy to reduce the frequency of episodic central basin anoxia.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	Ciborowski, Jan/0000-0002-6588-0366; 													0380-1330						2005	31			2			35	49		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70303-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70303-8													WOS:000238618700004

Relationships between freshwater sedimentary diatoms and environmental variables in Subarctic Icelandic lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The distribution patterns of surface sediment diatom assemblages from 49 lakes were used to explore the relationship between limnological variables and diatom assemblages as well as to assess an ecological classification system as a tool for the management and conservation of Icelandic freshwaters. Lakes were limnologically diverse ranging from deep, oligotrophic, ionically dilute lakes, to shallow lakes with a wide range of nutrient and ionic contents. Physical conditions (depth, surface area, surface water temperature) and nutrient and ion concentrations differed significantly among ecological lake categories (i.e., plateau, spring-fed, direct-runoff, valley, glacial, and coastal lakes) (ANOVA, p <0.05). Diatom assemblages were taxonomically diverse (329 taxa) with strong representation of planktonic, benthic and periphytic forms. Small benthic Fragilaria sensu lato (19 species and varieties) were the most abundant with combined abundances >20 % in all but 4 of the lakes, most likely due to the generally cold lake water conditions in this subarctic region. Variation in diatom distributions was best explained by the combination of mean depth (influencing littoral versus planktonic habitats), surface water temperature, specific conductivity, alkalinity, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and SiO2 in a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). However, these variables did not explain distribution patterns amongst small benthic Fragilaria taxa, although some weak relationships between some taxa and these variables were evident. Distinct diatom assemblages and limnological properties among ecological lake categories support the classification of Icelandic freshwaters based on major topographic, geological and hydrological characteristics. More detailed inclusion of lake depth along with lake basin form, as well as more refined categories of lake water origin and topographical positioning to better approximate regional climatic conditions, may improve the ecological classification of Icelandic freshwaters for conservation and management practices.

Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios in abyssal peridotites and in two xenoliths from the subcontinental lithosphere fall within the range observed for present-day oceanic basalts. Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios in anhydrous spinel lherzolites from Salt Lake Crater, Hawaii, however, range to extremely radiogenic values, although Nd-143/Nd-144 is within the range of present-day MORBs. These high Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios (epsilon(Hf) up to 76) are well outside the range of oceanic volcanics and indicate that peridotites such as these cannot have contributed significantly to Hawaiian volcanism. The high Hf-176/Hf-177, combined with the enriched trace element characteristics of the Salt Lake Crater peridotites may be explained by either metasomatism of a depleted peridotite by a melt which underwent extensive re-equilibration with material similar to the suboceanic lithosphere beneath Hawaii, or by ancient melt depletion (> 1 Ga) and recent enrichment of material stored in the sublithospheric mantle. The good correlation between Hf and Nd isotopes in OIBs indicates that the OIB source is not influenced by the high Hf-176/Hf-177 type mantle identified in the Salt Lake Crater xenoliths. In contrast, the lack of correlation between Hf and Nd isotopes in MORE can be explained by pollution of the MORE reservoir with small amounts of this high-field-strength-element-depleted, high Hf-176/Hf-177, lherzolitic material.

Interactions of a temperate North American fish community with a very low head hydropower facility in Ontario, Canada	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Efforts are underway to re-evaluate the use of existing instream infrastructure (e.g., weirs, water control dams) for the purposes of hydroelectric generation, with new very low head turbine technology that is purportedly "fish friendly" making retrofitting a viable option. This is the case at Wasdell Falls on the Severn River, ON, Canada, where the first very low head (VLH) turbines in Canada were put into operation at a long-standing low-head dam site. There is little information regarding fish usage of areas upstream from these structures and how this may relate to entrainment risk. Therefore, we assessed the risk of entrainment based on fish use of the forebay areas upstream from the infrastructure, including the forebay of three operating VLH turbines. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine movements and entrainment events of eight north temperate fish species. Entrainment through the VLH turbines did not occur over the course of one year, however, several fish did move downstream via other paths (e.g., over the water control structure). Forebay use was exclusive to rock bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike and largemouth bass, whereas channel catfish, walleye, white sucker and pumpkinseed avoided the forebay. When near the dam, fish tended to select deeper areas located away from the VLH forebay. Fish use of the VLH forebay was limited to brief forays indicating exploratory movements rather than prolonged residence. The findings suggest that entrainment risk at this VLH turbine site is low for the species and life stages studied.					; Lédée, Elodie/X-1537-2019; Ledee, Elodie Jacqueline Isabelle/X-1537-2019; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Tuononen, Erik/0000-0002-2537-7176; Ledee, Elodie Jacqueline Isabelle/0000-0001-8495-7827; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2022	38	4					657	669		10.1002/rra.3930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3930		JAN 2022											WOS:000744714700001

Drivers of aquatic macrophyte community structure in a Neotropical riverine lake	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We explored the hypothesis that flood events and connectivity interact with local factors (biotic and abiotic) to drive changes in aquatic vegetation in a typical backwater lake connected to the River Parana, Brazil. Over three years, we conducted quarterly surveys to analyse macrophyte composition and abundance, and environmental variables. In total 34 macrophyte species were recorded, with strong dominance of Eichhornia azurea. During periods of low water level, the lake vegetation was primarily structured by distance from the river. Total community abundance and emergent species diversity increased from the outer to the inner lake, while the opposite occurred for submersed and floating species. These changes were strongly associated with gradients of depth, slope, water transparency, oxygen and phosphorus. Two summer flood periods had different effects upon plants depending on flood features (e.g. intensity, duration) and location. Flood-pulses tended to reset the community, both in terms of species abundance and richness, and disrupt competitive processes. Flood disturbances likely governed interactions among facilitation and competition processes. While recovering from the major flood disturbance, E. azurea invested strongly in stem horizontal growth, but less so in leaf production. In this situation the physical structure of E. azurea facilitated colonization by several other macrophyte species, resulting in substantial and rapid increase in species richness. Under a more stable hydrology E. azurea displaced less competitive species by forming dense stands. Connectivity and flood-pulses were the main factors responsible for sustaining high diversity of aquatic macrophytes in the lake, but these drivers interact, in both time and space, with local environmental and biotic drivers to structure the temporally and spatially shifting mosaic of lake vegetation. Our results show the fundamental importance of natural variability of hydrological connectivity and flood disturbances for biodiversity conservation in tropical riverine floodplains.

J	Lepori, F; Robin, J				Lepori, Fabio; Robin, Joel			Nitrogen limitation of the phytobenthos in Alpine lakes: results from nutrient-diffusing substrata	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In the Alps, as in other mountainous regions across the world, nitrogen (N) enrichment of ecosystems via atmospheric deposition is a major environmental concern. Nitrogen enrichment can cause acidification in poorly buffered lakes and streams, but here we assessed the less well-known effects of eutrophication on the phytobenthos of lakes and its consequences for grazing. 2. To simulate the effects of N deposition, we conducted experimental nutrient additions (N and N+P) in two lakes in the French Alps, in summer 2012. In each lake, we deployed nutrient-diffusing substrata for 22 days. The substrata were placed within cages that either allowed or prevented access by macrograzers. We tested the hypotheses that N enrichment: (i) increases phytobenthic biomass, (ii) alters phytobenthic taxonomic composition and (iii) reduces benthic grazing. 3. Supporting the first hypothesis, at the end of the experiments N-enriched substrata had a greater phytobenthic biomass than unenriched substrata, indicating N limitation. Supporting the second hypothesis, the taxonomic composition of the phytobenthos differed between N-enriched and control substrata. Green algae, including filamentous forms, were favoured by N enrichment to a greater extent than diatoms and cyanobacteria. By contrast, the third hypothesis was not supported. Grazing had the same effect on the biomass of the phytobenthos regardless of nutrient treatment. 4. Our results highlight the sensitivity of Alpine lakes to deposition of atmospheric N. Its ecological effects are not limited to acidification, but also include increased biomass (eutrophication) and altered taxonomic composition of the phytobenthos. Because filamentous green algae favoured by N enrichment are usually unpalatable to macrograzers, inputs of atmospheric N could reduce the efficiency of transfer of energy from the phytobenthos up through the food web.					; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012	Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2014	59	8					1633	1645		10.1111/fwb.12370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12370													WOS:000339385100006
J	Rother, A; Pitsch, M; Hülsmann, S				Rother, Anne; Pitsch, Matthias; Huelsmann, Stephan			The importance of hatching from resting eggs for population dynamics and genetic composition of Daphnia in a deep reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Cyclical parthenogens, organisms switching between sexual and asexual mode of reproduction, are common in aquatic habitats. In permanent waterbodies with year-round persistence of populations, the relevance of sexually produced resting eggs for population dynamics and structure is still largely unexplored. 2. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of recruitment from resting eggs to Daphnia spp. in a deep dimictic reservoir with overwintering populations (Saidenbach Reservoir, Germany). We linked field studies on Daphnia population dynamics, hatching rates and diapausing egg abundances in the sediment with allozyme analysis of the genetic variability of both the pelagic population and hatchlings from resting eggs. 3. We found higher hatching rates at intermediate depths (10-18 m), although highest diapausing egg abundances were found in the deeper parts of the reservoir. From the extensive field data, we calculated a population budget for the main basin of the reservoir, which showed that hatched daphnids accounted for < 1% of the total abundance and explained only a tiny fraction of population growth. 4. The genetic composition (MultiLocus Genotypes, MLG) of the pelagic population was relatively stable throughout the stratified period with up to five among 39 detected MLGs attaining frequencies > 5% per date. From 11 MLGs differentiated among hatched daphnids, three were recovered in the pelagic population in perceptible, albeit low frequencies (1-4%). 5. We conclude that the contribution of hatched animals to the spring population dynamics is negligible in situations with an overwintering population present and will only become relevant if densities are extremely low. In this type of system, the significance of the resting egg bank is presumably mainly related to the maintenance of genetic diversity.

J	Echevarría, G; González, N				Echevarria, Gabriela; Gonzalez, Nirson			ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING AND LOW TRAIT REDUNDANCY CHARACTERISE FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN LAKE MAMO, ORINOCO RIVER FLOODPLAIN, VENEZUELA	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The study of assembly rules of fish communities in Neotropical floodplain lakes represents a major interest in community ecology due to their high species diversity and environmental variation, both spatial and temporal. In this study, assembly rules of freshwater fishes in Lake Mamo were explored. The main goals of this research were to analyse the seasonal variations in taxonomic and functional diversities of fishes in sandbanks and patches of aquatic macrophytes, in order to identify whether the fish assemblages are organised according to environmental filtering or limiting similarity, and to explore the relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity to determine if fish assemblages are either functionally redundant or complementary. In both mesohabitats, fishes were collected using seine nets during four hydrological seasons corresponding to low waters, rising waters, high waters and falling waters. Taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages in each habitat and across hydrological seasons was examined through multidimensional scaling (MDS), PERMANOVAs and principal co-ordinate analyses. Seasonal variations in taxonomic diversity were determined through Fligner tests of Shannon diversity indices, and for functional diversity, of functional richness (FRich), functional dispersion (FDisp), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv). Null model analyses were used to determine if the functional indices diverged from randomness across hydrological seasons. Finally, relationships between functional indices and Shannon diversity were explored using linear, power, asymptotic and logistic models. There were significant differences in taxonomic and functional composition between mesohabitats and more markedly across hydrological seasons. All fish assemblages were significantly underdispersed at all instances, while functional evenness was higher than expected in both mesohabitats during low waters, signaling both a strong environmental filtering and niche packing. There were significant linear associations between the Shannon diversity and functional dispersion and between the Shannon diversity and functional evenness, suggesting that functional redundancy in these assemblages is low. In Lake Mamo, fish assemblages are filtered first by seasonality and then by habitat type. As more species are added to the assemblages, niches are more packed in the functional space, but the number of traits increases at a constant rate. This means that if a lake becomes impaired as a consequence of potential oil spills, the loss of fish species could represent also the loss of traits and functions in the ecosystem.					; Díaz, Gabriela/X-3433-2019	Echevarria, Gabriela/0000-0001-9353-6696; 													2500-008X						2022	7	4								10.24189/ncr.2022.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.24189/ncr.2022.034													WOS:000855185300001

This study investigates the institutional factors driving the lake's decline by applying the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to Iran's Five-Year Development Programs (FYDPs) from 1989 to 2021. Our qualitative analysis indicates that extensive dam construction, driven by a hydraulic mission paradigm, and agricultural policies prioritizing national food self-sufficiency have been the primary contributors to Lake Urmia's decline. A lack of coherence within development programs remains a critical issue. Although recent FYDPs incorporated water conservation objectives, they consistently prioritized agricultural self-sufficiency, contributing to the continued expansion of agriculture in the Lake Urmia Basin. By the end of the sixth FYDP, the lake's water level had fallen 3.42 m below its ecological threshold. The study highlights the lock-in effects of agricultural policies established by FYDPs, which constrain policy shifts toward sustainable approaches. Given the failure of top-down policies to restore Lake Urmia, this study advocates for re-evaluating national development plans and engaging local stakeholders in the development of environmental and water policies to foster long-term ecological sustainability and socio-economic resilience in the region.

The effects of frozen lake surfaces on terrigenous sediment deposition and how climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau are reflected in these lakes, however, is seldom discussed. A lake sediment core from Hala Lake (590 km(2)), northeastern Tibetan Plateau spanning the time interval from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present was investigated using high-resolution grain-size composition of lacustrine deposits. Seismic analysis along a north-south profile across the lake was used to infer the sedimentary setting within the lake basin. Periods of freezing and melting processes on the lake surface were identified by MODIS (MOD10A1) satellite data. End-member modeling of the grain size distribution allowed the discrimination between lacustrine, eolian and fluvial sediments. The dominant clay sedimentation (slack water type) during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) reflects ice interceptions in long cold periods, in contrast to abundant eolian input during abrupt cold events. Therefore, fluvial and slack water sedimentation processes can indicate changes in the local paleoclimate during periods of the lake being frozen, when eolian input was minor. Inferred warm (i.e., similar to 22.7 and 19.5 cal. ka BP) and cold (i.e., similar to 11-9 and 3-1.5 cal. ka BP) spells have significant environmental impacts, not only in the regional realm, but they are also coherent with global-scale climate events. The eolian input generally follows the trend of the mid-latitude westerly wind dynamics in winter, contributing medium-sized sand to the lake center, deposited within the ice cover during icing and melting phases. Enhanced input was dominant during the Younger Dryas, Heinrich Event 1 and at around 8.2 ka, equivalent to the well-known events of the North Atlantic realm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Saito, L; Koski, M				Saito, L; Koski, M			Simulated effects of altered spillway releases on thermal structure and kokanee growth in a Colorado reservoir	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In-reservoir thermal and ecological effects of releasing some flows over the surface spillway at Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado, rather than routing all releases through the hypolimnetic outlet were evaluated using a calibrated and validated one-dimensional thermal model (CE-THERM) with a set of ecological models. Thermal model output indicated that surface water temperatures were influenced primarily by atmospheric conditions, but the release of warmer water over the spillway resulted in a thinner epilimnion and cooler metalimnetic water temperatures. Ecological model predictions indicated that spillway releases and associated temperatures resulted in lower growth rates for young-of-year (YOY) kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the reservoir by up to 9 percent when compared with growth rates under baseline operations with no releases over the spillway. Kokanee growth rates were reduced under spillway release scenarios because lower temperatures not only affected metabolic rates, but limited the productivity of the zooplankton as well. Thus, altering the release regime with spillway discharges could have deleterious effects on Blue Mesa's YOY kokanee. However, in other reservoirs, distributing discharges among different elevations may provide managers with a mechanism to regulate temperatures to benefit species of concern that are facing challenges imposed by environmental conditions such as global warming.

Central Tibetan Plateau atmospheric trace metals contamination: A 500-year record from the Puruogangri ice core	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A similar to 500-year section of ice core (1497-1992) from the Puruogangri ice cap has been analyzed at high resolution for 28 trace elements (TEs: Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V and Zn) to assess different atmospheric contributions to the ice and provide a temporal perspective on the diverse atmospheric influences over the central Tibetan Plateau (TP). At least two volcanic depositions have significantly impacted the central TP over the past 500 years, possibly originating from the Billy Mitchell (1580, Papua New Guinea) and the Parker Peak (1641, Philippines) eruptions. A decreasing aeolian dust input to the ice cap allowed the detection of an atmospheric pollution signal. The anthropogenic pollution contribution emerges in the record since the early 1900s (for Sb and Cd) and increases substantially after 1935 (for Ag, Zn, Pb, Cd and Sb). The metallurgy (Zn, Pb and steel smelting) emission products (Cd, Zn, Pb and Ag) from the former Soviet Union and especially from central Asia (e.g., Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) likely enhanced the anthropogenic deposition to the Puruogangri ice cap between 1935 and 1980, suggesting that the westerlies served as a conveyor of atmospheric pollution to central Tibet. The impact of this industrial pollution cumulated with that of the hemispheric coal and gasoline combustion which are respectively traced by Sb and Pb enrichment in the ice. The Chinese steel production accompanying the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) and the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) is proposed as a secondary but proximal source of Pb pollution affecting the ice cap between 1958 and 1976. The most recent decade (1980-1992) of the enrichment time series suggests that Puruogangri ice cap recorded the early Sb, Cd, Zn, Pb and Ag pollution originating from developing countries of South (i.e., India) and East (i.e., China) Asia and transported by the summer monsoonal circulation.

Neither hydrological nor climatological models for the region are sufficiently developed to describe the magnitude or direction of change in response to increased carbon dioxide; thus, an attempt to predict specific responses of aquatic ecosystems is premature. Instead, we focus on the sensitivity of rivers, streams, springs, wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes of the region to potential changes in climate, especially those inducing a change in hydrological patterns such as amount, timing and predictability of stream flow. The major sensitivities of aquatic ecosystems are their permanence and even existence in the face of potential reduced net basin supply of water, stability of geomorphological structure and riparian ecotones with alterations in disturbance regimes, and water quality changes resulting from a modified water balance. In all of these respects, aquatic ecosystems of the region are also sensitive to the extensive modifications imposed by human use of water resources, which underscores the difficulty of separating this type of anthropogenic change from climate change. We advocate a focus in future research on reconstruction and analysis of past climates and associated ecosystem characteristics, long-term studies to discriminate directional change vs. year to year variability (including evidence of aquatic ecosystem responses or sensitivity to extremes), and studies of ecosystems affected by human activity.

Hypolimnetic oxygenation 4. Effects on turbidity in Camanche Reservoir and its downstream fish hatchery. Lake and Reserve Manage. XX:XX-XX. Turbidity is a major concern for reservoir, river, and hatchery managers, partially because sediments smother fish eggs. The oxygenated plume of the Camanche Reservoir hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS) is close enough to the sediments to suppress releases of nutrients, hydrogen sulfide, and methylmercury. Experiments and models predicted little sediment resuspension from the plume. On/off in-reservoir tests in the initial year of HOS operation (1993) showed a small (x = 1.4 NTU) and not statistically significant increase in average turbidity that extended over 300 m, was minimal at 1.5 km (0.3 NTU), and was not apparent in the next year (1994). Increased turbidity was attributed to tiny (<2 mu m) calcite particles caused by lake whitening during intense periods of photosynthesis during cyanobacterial blooms prior to HOS. Turbidity in the fish hatchery declined substantially (4 to 2 NTU, summer 1991 vs. 1994) and averaged 2.5 NTU in 1999 and 2009. This decline is likely due to the 79% HOS-induced decrease in chlorophyll, because bottom turbidity was related to algae blooms (R-2 = 0.57) if lagged by 4 weeks to allow the algae to sink. The result would be less planktonic remains and fewer lake whitening particles sinking to deep water. Microscopic examination, size spectrum analysis, and chemical fingerprinting of particles showed that egg tray sediments (mostly inorganic silica diatom frustules and aeolian dust with an even size spectrum from 0 to 200 mu m) were not like those in the reservoir bottom water outflow (mostly organic and <2-mu m calcite particles).																			1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 1	2020	36	4					360	375		10.1080/10402381.2020.1739180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2020.1739180		MAY 2020											WOS:000535002500001
J	Katsanevakis, S				Katsanevakis, S			Abundance and spatial distribution of the Mediterranean scallop, Pecten jacobaeus, in a marine lake	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Pecten jacobaeus is an exploitable bivalve, whose populations have greatly declined in the main Mediterranean fisheries since the mid-1980s. A substantial population of the species was studied in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density and the spatial distribution of P. jacobaeus were estimated in the lake with line transect sampling by SCUBA diving, a method not previously used for scallop density estimations. Individuals of the first size class (small) were mainly restricted to shallow waters (4-8 m), while individuals of the second size class (large) were mainly restricted to deeper waters (> 12 m). Possible reasons for this size-separation were: (1) the most appropriate settlement substrate for pediveligers was in shallow waters, (2) the strong summer thermocline in the lake may have induced the selection of the shallow and warm bottoms of the take as settlement areas, (3) intraspecific competition between adults and pediveligers, and (4) the high fishing mortality of large individuals in shallow waters. On the hypothesis that successful recruitment of R jacobaeus occurred mostly in the shallow areas of the lake, it was deduced that P. jacobaeus gradually migrated, as they grew, from the shallow settlement fields of the lake to the deeper areas. The density of large individuals was associated with depth and the degree of scatter (QD phi) of the granule size frequencies. Higher densities of large individuals were found deeper and in poorly sorted sediments (QD phi > 1.0). The size of large individuals was positively correlated with depth. The size of P. jacobaeus population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, QY; Wu, JL; Sakiev, K				Li, Qianyu; Wu, Jinglu; Sakiev, Kadyrbek			Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils near and around Lake Son-Kul in the western Tian Shan Mountains, Central Asia	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose Summer pasture development and tourism near and around Lake Son-Kul in the western Tian Shan Mountains has resulted in a local source of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) that lack monitoring and evaluation. Materials and methods Twenty-eight soil samples were collected from the Lake Son-Kul Basin (SKB) and Naryn River Valley (NRV) to measure OCP concentrations and evaluate their composition, transport processes, and ecological risks. Results and discussion Except for the high OCP concentration measured at one location, site 7 (145.32ng/g dw), total OCP concentrations in the SKB ranged from 2.36 to 24.13ng/g dw, slightly higher than concentrations in the NRV (1.69-7.45ng/g dw) and similar to values in polar regions. Among the OCPs, HCHs and methoxychlor were the predominant compounds that accumulated in soils, followed by DDTs and Aldrins, whereas Chlors and Endos displayed lowest concentrations, indicating that animal husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the study area. Most of the less volatile pesticides, including -HCH, p,p-DDT, and Chlors, represent past use from local sources, for instance the pesticides warehouse at site 7. More volatile compounds such as -HCH, -HCH, and p'p-DDE represent exogenous atmospheric transport to the study area, as demonstrated by their isomeric ratios. Ecological risk assessment showed that the surface environment of the study area remains in good condition. Conclusions Findings from this study provided a snapshot of the current status of OCP contamination in soils of the Lake Son-Kul region. Although historical OCP contamination has impacted the lake's ecology, catchment soils display low levels of OCP contamination.					li, qianyu/GXV-6594-2022														1439-0108	1614-7480				APR	2019	19	4					1685	1696		10.1007/s11368-018-2163-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2163-4													WOS:000462500000008
J	El Atfy, H; Brocke, R; Uhl, D				El Atfy, Haytham; Brocke, Rainer; Uhl, Dieter			A fungal proliferation near the probable Oligocene/Miocene boundary, Nukhul Formation, Gulf of Suez, Egypt	JOURNAL OF MICROPALAEONTOLOGY												Moderately to well-preserved palynomorph assemblages were recorded from thirty samples of the Nukhul Formation (GH 404-2A Well), southern Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The taxa are dominated by highly diverse fungi, freshwater algae (e.g. Botryococcus, Pediastrum) beside a sparse record of spores and pollen. Marine palynomorphs, such as dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), are very rare. The stratigraphy and age of the Nukhul Formation is highly debated due to lack of diagnostic fossils (e.g. foraminifera, nannoplankton). It has been referred mostly to the Early Miocene; however, some recent publications interpret it as being of latest Oligocene-Early Miocene age. A prominent fungal proliferation composed of diverse and moderately well-preserved fungal spores, fungal fragments, fructifications and hyphae is recorded. This fungi-rich interval occurs mainly from 11370 to 11430 ft in the GH 404-2A Well. Such an observation has not been noted previously within the Nukhul Formation or its stratigraphic equivalents in Egypt. This putative 'eco-event' is probably associated with the well-known eustatic sea-level fall in the latest Chattian to early Aquitanian or at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary (OMB). It also seems possible that it may represent a more local event related to the rifting of the Gulf of Suez during this period. The high diversity of fossil fungi is interpreted herein as an indication of an episodic prevalence of humid climate at the end of a regressive phase, as also indicated by a lithological change near the top of the Shoab Ali Member of the Nukhul Formation. In addition, the co-occurrence of freshwater algae, mainly Botryococcus and Pediastrum, together with some aquatic fungal genera, such as Involutisporonites, Paragrantisporites, Quilonia, Striadiporites and Reduviasporonites, suggests the temporary existence of shallow, pond- or lake-like aquatic habitats, possibly related to tectonic activity.																			0262-821X					JUL	2013	32		2				183	195		10.1144/jmpaleo2013-004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/jmpaleo2013-004													WOS:000322985300005
J	Romero, JR; Imberger, J				Romero, JR; Imberger, J			Effect of a flood underflow on reservoir water quality: Data and three-dimensional modeling	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												As in many of the world's reservoirs, floods provide most of the water to Lake Burragorang (Sydney, Australia). In this study a winter flood through this large (2 km(3)), long (ca. 50km) and narrow (ca. 0.5-2km) reservoir was monitored at multiple stations over several weeks. The nutrient-laden underflow took 7-8 days to travel from the river confluence to the dam and upwardly displaced the pre-flood anoxic hypolimnion. Particulate phosphorus and nitrogen, and turbidity settled at an exponential rate (0.34-0.42d(-1)) in the head of the underflow. Application of a three-dimensional model (ELCOM) with large grid sizes (200x200x1m) for reasonable run times (ca. I day) did not resolve the underflow hydrodynamics in this large, narrow and complex geometry. A technique for 'straightening' morphologies that are narrow and curvy was applied to the Lake Burragorang bathymetry to allow large model grid sizes. Simulations with the 'straightened' bathymetry had low run times and compared well with field data. Then, an aquatic ecological model (CAEDYM) was coupled to ELCOM to simulate the biogeochemical fate of the floodwaters. Simulated spatial patterns of dissolved oxygen, and filterable and particulate nutrients compared well with field data. Further, the ELCOM-CAEDYM simulation demonstrated that the dynamic spatial variations in water quality from a Eularian perspective during such flood events are dominated by transport. Settling is the dominant process in the head of the underflow from a Lagrangian frame of reference. To simulate spatial variations during a flood it is adequate to couple an accurate hydrodynamic driver to a simply configured biogeochemical model.

J	Bonzongo, JC; Heim, KJ; Warwick, JJ; Lyons, WB				Bonzongo, JC; Heim, KJ; Warwick, JJ; Lyons, WB			Mercury levels in surface waters of the Carson River Lahontan Reservoir system, Nevada: Influence of historic mining activities	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Total mercury (Hg-T), methylmercury (MeHg), and other operationally defined Hg species were determined on water samples collected from a river-reservoir system impacted by historic mine wastes. Simultaneously, a comprehensive study was undertaken to determine the influence of some major physico-chemical parameters on the fate of Hg within the system. Total Hg levels showed an increase from background concentrations of 4 ng liter(-1) upstream of mining activity, to peak values of 1500-2100 ng liter(-1) downstream of Hg contaminated mine tailings piles, MeHg concentrations varied from 0.1 to 7 ng liter(-1) in surface waters. In both cases, peak values were associated with the highest concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS). Particulate Hg (Hg-P) was typically >50% of Hg-T and increased downstream. The dissolved fraction of MeHg (MeHg(D)) always constituted a large portion of total methylmercury (MeHg(T)). The [MeHg(T)]/[Hg-T] ratio decreased downstream suggesting either a high percentage of inorganic Hg input from point sources, or low specific rates of MeHg production within the aquatic system. The latter could be due to the combined effects on microbial populations of both high levels of Hg concentrations found in water and sediments, and other factors related to the aqueous geochemistry of the system. Concentrations of Hg-T in the water column appeared to be enhanced by inputs of contaminated particles from the watershed during spring snow melt. In the reservoir, significant losses of Hg from the water column were observed. In addition to losses of Hg bound to particles by sedimentation, the removal through volatilization of dissolved gaseous Hg could be an important pathway. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Modeling accumulated degree-days for the invasive aquatic plants Oxycaryum cubense and Eichhornia crassipes in Mississippi	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Cuban bulrush [ Oxycaryum cubense (Poepp. & Kunth) Lye] and water hyacinth [ Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms] cause major ecological and economical impacts in the southeastern United States. These species are commonly associated with each other because of the epiphytic nature of Cuban bulrush, as it utilizes water hyacinth (and other floating plants or objects) as a colonization substrate. Increasing global temperatures may allow for the northward expansion of both species in North America. The purpose of this study was to model plant growth (i.e., biomass) as a function of accumulated degree-days (ADD) to predict peak biomass of both species growing in Lake Columbus, Mississippi. Models suggested water hyacinth and Cuban bulrush life cycles were asynchronous, thus ADD calculations did not occur over the same set of dates. Water hyacinth biomass peaked in September (estimated 5,399 ADD), and Cuban bulrush biomass peaked in February (6,549 ADD). Estimated base temperature threshold at which water hyacinth growth occurs is - 1 C, while Cuban bulrush base threshold was estimated at - 4 C. There was a difference of 10 and 100 ADD between the predicted and observed peak biomass occurrence of water hyacinth and Cuban bulrush, respectively. Models suggest Cuban bulrush can survive lower temperatures than water hyacinth and can potentially invade states farther north than its current distribution in the United States. It is likely that annual winter ice formation on water bodies will be the major barrier to northern expansion Cuban bulrush.																			0146-6623					JAN	2024	62						23	29		10.57257/JAPM-D-23-00006	http://dx.doi.org/10.57257/JAPM-D-23-00006													WOS:001247507100004

Geomorphology and urban geology of Bukavu (RD Congo): interaction between slope instability and human settlement	MAPPING HAZARDOUS TERRAIN USING REMOTE SENSING	Geological Society Special Publication											The city of Bukavu, on the south coast of Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, suffers from frequent landsliding, which leads to continual damage and destruction of buildings, roads, waterworks and sewerage infrastructure. Thirty-one landslides identified on aerial photographs of 1954 and 1973 are located outside the Bukavu micro-rift and are related to actively incising rivers. Their origin is thought to be due to increases in hydrostatic pressure. Six landslides occur within the Bukavu micro-rift, four of which are much larger and wider than other slope failures in the study region. These large landslides are adjacent to, or crossed by, active faults. They fall far below the topographic threshold envelope, a relationship of slopes at the head of the slide and the surface area drained into it, indicating seismic or anthropomorphic triggering. The Bukavu landslides still reactivate occasionally. Deforestation, followed by a large increase in the population, have been indirect causes of the reactivated mass wasting processes. On the steep slopes in the south of the city the high density of newly built houses has led to reduced water infiltration and enhanced runoff, causing landslides and mudflows. Very high spatial resolution IKONOS satellite images have recently been used as base maps for geohazard assessments of Bukavu. A geographical information system (GIS) has been developed for Bukavu's planners: this shows the locations of buildings, roads and tracks, the river network, the water distribution system and the sewerage infrastructure, as well as areas of slope instability.																			0305-8719		978-1-86239-229-8				2007	283						65	75		10.1144/SP283.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP283.6													WOS:000268158300007
J	Scholten, JCM; Joye, SB; Hollibaugh, JT; Murrell, JC				Scholten, JCM; Joye, SB; Hollibaugh, JT; Murrell, JC			Molecular analysis of the sulfate reducing and archaeal community in a meromictic soda lake (Mono Lake, California) by targeting 16S rRNA, mcrA, apsA, and dsrAB genes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Sulfate reduction is the most important process involved in the mineralization of carbon in the anoxic bottom waters of Mono Lake, an alkaline, hypersaline, meromictic Lake in California. Another important biogeochemical process in Mono Lake is thought to be sulfate-dependent methane oxidation (SDMO). However little is known about what types of organisms are involved in these processes in Mono Lake. Therefore, the sulfate-reducing and archaeal microbial community in Mono Lake was analyzed by targeting 16S rRNA, methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA), adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (apsA), and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrAB) genes to investigate the sulfate-reducing and archaeal community with depth. Most of the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the samples fell into the delta-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the clones obtained represented sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are probably involved in the mineralization of carbon in Mono Lake, many of them belonging to a novel line of descent in the delta-Proteobacteria. Only 6% of the sequences retrieved from the samples affiliated to the domain Euryarchaeota but did not represent Archaea, which is considered to be responsible for SDMO [Orphan et al. 2001: Appl Environ Microbiol 67:1922-1934; Teske et al.: Appl Environ Microbiol 68:1994-2007]. On the basis of our results and thermodynamic arguments, we proposed that SDMO in hypersaline environments is presumably carried out by SRB alone. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of the mcrA-, apsA-, and dsrAB genes in Mono Lake samples were, in most cases, not successful. Only the PCR amplification of the apsA gene was partially successful. The amplification of these functional genes was not successful because there was either insufficient "target" DNA in the samples, or the microorganisms in Mono Lake have divergent functional genes.					; Murrell, John/B-1443-2012	Joye, Samantha/0000-0003-1610-451X; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2005	50	1					29	39		10.1007/s00248-004-0085-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-004-0085-8								16132423					WOS:000232267300004
J	Meyer, H; Chapligin, B; Hoff, U; Nazarova, L; Diekmann, B				Meyer, Hanno; Chapligin, Bernhard; Hoff, Ulrike; Nazarova, Larisa; Diekmann, Bernhard			Oxygen isotope composition of diatoms as Late Holocene climate proxy at Two-Yurts Lake, Central Kamchatka, Russia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Especially in combination with other proxies, the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)) from lake sediments is useful for interpreting past climate conditions. This paper presents the first oxygen isotope data of fossil diatoms from Kamchatka, Russia, derived from sediment cores from Two-Yurts Lake (TYL). For reconstructing Late Holocene climate change, palaeolimnological investigations also included diatom, pollen and chironomid analysis. The most recent diatom sample (delta O-18(diatom) = +23.3 parts per thousand) corresponds well with the present day isotopic composition of the TYL water (mean delta O-18 = 14.8 parts per thousand) displaying a reasonable isotope fractionation in the system silica-water. Nonetheless, the TYL delta O-18(diatom) record is mainly controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of the lake water. TYL is considered as a dynamic system triggered by differential environmental changes closely linked with lake-internal hydrological factors. The diatom silica isotope record displays large variations in delta O-18(diatom) from +27.3 parts per thousand to +23.3 parts per thousand from about similar to 4.5 kyr BP until today. A continuous depletion in delta O-18(diatom) of 4.0 parts per thousand is observed in the past 4.5 kyr, which is in good accordance with other hemispheric environmental changes (i.e. a summer insolation-driven Mid- to Late Holocene cooling). The overall cooling trend is superimposed by regional hydrological and atmospheric-oceanic changes. These are related to the interplay between Siberian High and Aleutian Low as well as to the ice dynamics in the Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, combined delta O-18(diatom) and chironomid interpretations provide new information on changes related to meltwater input to lakes. Hence, this diatom isotope study provides further insight into hydrology and climate dynamics of this remote, rarely investigated area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two complementary methods were used for relocation: a conventional least-squares approach (Lienert and Havskov, 1995) and joint hypocentral determination (Pujol, 2000). These two methods yielded mutually consistent spatial patterns of seismicity with an average difference of 3.7 km in epicentral locations and 1.1 km in focal depths. We show that the hypocenter locations are not very sensitive to realistic uncertainties in 1D crustal velocity. Our sharpened definition of zones of seismicity delineates several clusters beneath Lake Ontario, around Niagara Falls, and near the south shore of Lake Erie. These seismicity zones appear to correlate with areas where the regional magnetic data exhibit prominent short-wavelength (<5 km) linear anomalies. The magnetic anomalies are associated with basement structures that formed during the Precambrian (Mesoproterozoic) Grenville orogen. Both the seismicity and magnetic anomalies exhibit statistically significant preferred orientations at N40degreesE-N45degreesE, but the correlation of the earthquake clusters with specific aeromagnetic lineaments remains uncertain. Three preliminary focal mechanisms of earthquakes with magnitudes m(N) 3.1 to 3.8 show unusual normal faulting, with nodal planes in almost the same direction as the magnetic trends, N42degreesE-N52degreesE. Proximity of the earthquake clusters to large bodies of water, coupled with colinearity with magnetic anomaly trends, suggests that both surface water and pre-existing basement structures may play significant roles in controlling intraplate seismicity in the southern Great Lakes region.																			0037-1106	1943-3573				OCT	2004	94	5					1902	1918		10.1785/012003007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/012003007													WOS:000224952900024
J	Evans, DH				Evans, David H.			Cephalopod accumulations from the Late Ordovician of Cumbria: Mud mounds and stromatolites	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												Accumulations of cephalopods in the Late Ordovician (Katian [Ka4]) Troutbeck Siltstone Member of the Ash Gill Mudstone Formation at Skelghyll Beck in the Lake District and in the Keisley Limestone Formation of the Cross Fell Inlier contribute toward an understanding of their respective depositional environments as well as the palaeogeography of the southeastern margins of the Lakesman Terrane. The accumulation present in the Troutbeck Siltstone Member is interpreted as having been deposited in a shallow, near-shore lagoon that supported stromatolite growth. The shore lay to the north of this site. Geopetals infilling cephalopods forming concentrations in the Keisley Limestone Formation indicate that the conchs came to rest on angles of 30-40 degrees to horizontal. The lithologies of the matrix suggest that they were deposited in cavities or fissures from which fine-grained carbonate was either excluded or winnowed away. Both observations accord with hypotheses that the Keisley Limestone Formation represents the remnants of a carbonate mudmound, and facilitate comparison with the contemporaneous Boda mounds of Siljan, Sweden. Comparison with local late Katian - Hirnantian successions indicate that the Keisley mound would have formed a prominent feature on the sea floor, becoming largely buried by argillaceous sediments during the Hirnantian.

Elevated metal concentrations were found where the rocks are covered with vegetation, but even more so, where the bedrock is exposed The presence of vegetation reduces weathering, and this is reflected in the chemistry of the lake sediment cores drilled down to the sediment deposited in a late glacial ice-dammed lake 9000 - 12000 years ago. The black shale catchment area was exposed during the isolation of a small lake from a much larger ice-damned lake 9000 years ago. Before the shoreline became colonised by vegetation, intense oxidation of sulphides led to a steady increase in lake water acidity, with diatom assemblages indicating that pH fell to as low as 3.8. Trace metal abundances meanwhile increased, up to values of 0.1% Ni, 0.03% Cu, 0.5% Zn and 3.4% Al. Following colonisation by vegetation the chemical characteristics of the lake sediments in areas underlain by black shales began to converge with those of sediments in lakes underlain by gneiss granite or quartzite. A difference is nevertheless still discernible in the Ni, Zn, and Cd abundance of the respective lake waters and sediments, even though the pH values are virtually the same.																					90-5809-068-X				1999							1199	1202																WOS:000082419300294

Here we measured Hg concentrations and stable isotopes in sediment, seston, and fishes from the various basins of the Baltic Sea, a large brackish ecosystem presenting extensive gradients in salinity, redox conditions, dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, and biological activities. We found that Hg mass dependent fractionation (Hg-MDF) values in sediments mostly reflect a mixing between light terrestrial Hg and heavier industrial sources, whereas odd Hg isotope mass independent fractionation (odd Hg-MIF) reveals atmospheric inputs. Seston presents intermediate Hg-MDF and odd Hg-MIF values falling between sediments and fish, but in northern basins, high even Hg-MIF values suggest the preferential accumulation of wet-deposited Hg. Odd Hg-MIF values in fish indicate an overall low extent of MMHg photodegradation due to limited sunlight exposure and penetration but also reveal large spatial differences. The photodegradation extent is lowest in the central basin with recurrent algal blooms due to their shading effect and is highest in the northern, least saline basin with high concentrations of terrestrial DOM. As increased loads of terrestrial DOM are expected in many coastal areas due to global changes, its impact on MMHg photodegradation needs to be better understood and accounted for when predicting future MMHg concentrations in aquatic ecosystems.

J	Bui, LK; Awange, J; Vu, DT				Bui, Luyen K.; Awange, Joseph; Vu, Dinh Toan			Precipitation and Soil Moisture Spatio-Temporal Variability and Extremes over Vietnam (1981-2019): Understanding Their Links to Rice Yield	SENSORS												Vietnam, one of the three leading rice producers globally, has recently seen an increased threat to its rice production emanating from climate extremes (floods and droughts). Understanding spatio-temporal variability in precipitation and soil moisture is essential for policy formulations to adapt and cope with the impacts of climate extremes on rice production in Vietnam. Adopting a higher-order statistical method of independent component analysis (ICA), this study explores the spatio-temporal variability in the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation Station's (CHIRPS) precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System's (GLDAS) soil moisture products. The results indicate an agreement between monthly CHIRPS precipitation and monthly GLDAS soil moisture with the wetter period over the southern and South Central Coast areas that is latter than that over the northern and North Central Coast areas. However, the spatial patterns of annual mean precipitation and soil moisture disagree, likely due to factors other than precipitation affecting the amount of moisture in the soil layers, e.g., temperature, irrigation, and drainage systems, which are inconsistent between areas. The CHIRPS Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is useful in capturing climate extremes, and the GLDAS Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) is useful in identifying the influences of climate extremes on rice production in Vietnam. During the 2016-2018 period, there existed a reduction in the residual rice yield that was consistent with a decrease in soil moisture during the same time period.					; Luyen, BUI/AAN-3365-2021	Awange, Joseph/0000-0003-3533-613X; Bui, Luyen/0000-0003-1091-5573; VU, Dinh Toan/0000-0002-4508-1559														1424-8220				MAR	2022	22	5							1906	10.3390/s22051906	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22051906								35271054					WOS:000771513400001

To monitor the characteristics of saltation activity and to calculate the threshold wind velocity and sediment discharge under field conditions have significance on the research of dust emission by wind erosion. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted over the flat sand in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert. One sampling system was installed on the flat sand surface at Tazhong, consisting of a meteorological tower with a height of 2 m, a piezoelectric saltation sensor (Sensit), and a Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sampler station. Occurrence of saltation activity was recorded every second using the Sensit. Each BSNE station consisted of five BSNE samplers with the lowest sampler at 0.05 m and the highest sampler at 1.0 m above the soil surface. Sediment was collected from the samplers every 24 h. It is found that saltation activity was detected for only 21.5% of the hours measured, and the longest period of saltation activity occurring continuously was not longer than 5 min under the field conditions. The threshold wind velocity was variable, its minimum value was 4.9 m s(-1), the maximum value was 9.2 m (s-1), and the average value was 7.0 m s(-1). The threshold wind velocity presented a positive linear increase during the measurement period. The observation site had a sediment discharge of 82.1 kg m(-1) over a period of 24 h. Based on hourly saltation counts, hourly sediment discharge was estimated. Overall, there was no obvious linear or other functional relationship between the hourly sediment discharge and wind velocity. The results show that the changes of sediment discharge do not quite depend on wind velocity.

Father Zimmermann (1871-1950): the first Brazilian diatomist	DIATOM RESEARCH												This paper describes the scientific life of Father Zimmermann, Brazil's first diatomist. Father Zimmermann, a Jesuit priest born in Ehingen, Germany in 1871, studied theology in Britain in the early 20th century. His scientific life began in Portugal where, with other Jesuits, he founded the scientific journal Broteria, for which he wrote several papers on diatoms. After the fall of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910, several conservative priests, including Zimmermann, immigrated to Brazil. In Brazil, he became a teacher at the Padre Antonio Vieira School in Salvador in the state of Bahia, where he taught a myriad of disciplines. In addition to his teaching and religious activities, along with his fellow priests, Zimmermann continued to edit Broteria. By the end of his career in Portugal, Zimmermann had described a total of 69 new but not all valid diatom names. In 1913, Zimmermann began a series of articles entitled 'Contribuicao para o estudo das diatomaceas dos Estados Unidos do Brazil' (Contribution to the study of diatoms of the United States of Brazil), in which he described two new genera and 49 new species from rivers, lakes, wetlands, reservoirs and beaches in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. In addition to his taxonomic descriptions, Zimmermann who was an accomplished naturalist, also wrote about diatom movements and evolution. His diatom studies were compiled in a book entitled Diatomees, which has never been published. Father Zimmermann's contribution to the study of diatoms deserves proper recognition. This paper aims to serve such purpose. Farther Zimmermann died in Salvador in 1950.					; Silva, Eduardo/B-5382-2012; Gomes, Doriedson/F-8228-2013	Gell, Peter/0000-0002-2251-5158; Williams, David/0000-0002-0584-307X; 													0269-249X	2159-8347					2012	27	3					177	188		10.1080/0269249X.2012.698646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2012.698646													WOS:000306744400006

The most important feature of this place that influences tourist traffic is its relief, numerous forms such as high peaks, long embankment valleys, numerous caves, lakes, streams, and karst springs. While walking in the Western Tatras region, it can be seen exposures of deformed rocks, creating numerous folds and scales. In this region, there were also numerous mines associated with ore-bearing, polymetallic mineralization (mainly copper, silver, and iron). They are formed by numerous quartz veins with barite and sulfides occurring in the Ornak region. Numerous traces of adits and heaps have been preserved to this day, visible on the slopes of this massif, which are now covered with forest. There is no information about these places on the selected routes, and in Zakopane - the nearest city on the Polish side of the Tatra Mountains - there is no center that could familiarize tourists with the interesting geological structure of the Tatra Mountains. The author performed petrographic studies of these veins and discussed the possibility of exposing these places as a monument to the historical exploitation of raw materials in the Western Tatras.

J	Coulombe, O; Bouchard, F; Pienitz, R				Coulombe, Olivier; Bouchard, Frederic; Pienitz, Reinhard			Coupling of sedimentological and limnological dynamics in subarctic thermokarst ponds in Northern Quebec (Canada) on an interannual basis	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Landscapes are changing at fast rates in subarctic regions due to recent climate warming and related permafrost thaw. As a consequence, thermokarst lakes and ponds are forming and their properties are changing rapidly. Here, we report on the interannual (2012-2014) variability of sedimentological and limnological conditions in a recently formed thermokarst pond in discontinuous permafrost terrain in Northern Quebec, and we discuss various aspects of pond sedimentation processes. Sediment samples from collecting traps and a short core were analyzed for particle size, organic matter content and geochemical composition, as well as C-14 dating of a peat sample from the core. Results reveal the preponderance of silts containing 2 to 13% organic matter and an age of 1825-1950 cal. yr. BP for the peat sample. A hypoxic hypolimnion formed in the pond during the short summers. Apparent sedimentation rates (up to 5.5 mm/d) varied in relation to local meteorological conditions and snow cover. The results also reveal major parameters associated with sediment composition, most notably dissolved oxygen in the water column, sampling depth and the year of sampling. Microplankton (20-200 mu m) is likely the main source of organic matter, which represents up to 10 to 13% of sediment trap samples, considering its size matching a major grain size mode (44.9-59.0 mu m). Using sedimentation rates and an estimation of long-term sediment compaction, the pond's "life span" was calculated at 370 to 600 years. This represents a baseline for the general understanding of the development of young (15-20 years) subarctic thermokarst ponds overlying impermeable soils, and provides an approximate time frame for the potential response of such systems to climate change impacts on northern landscapes.

Although much progress has been made in developed countries, suitable strategies for mitigating agricultural N loss in developing countries, such as China, are still required. In particular, studies that comprehensively measure the effect of fertilizer strategies on N loss through runoff and leaching would be beneficial in the design of fertilizer programs that meet the needs of the dominant cropping systems in China, while protecting nearby water bodies. In this study, agricultural plots (n = 21) in the Nansi Lake Watershed of Shandong District, China, were fitted with runoff and leachate collection devices to monitor the effect of different N fertilizer treatment strategies, including OPT, CRN, DMS, and STR for a wheat-maize rotation system on N loss through water transport. Runoff and leachates were collected at 10 typical growth stages of the consecutive wheat and maize seasons throughout a 2-year period. Yield and precipitation data for each plot were also collected. One of the main findings was the significant positive correlation between precipitation levels and the quantity of leachates and runoff. In addition, the amount of water collected in the various treatment was affected by agricultural practices, such as straw incorporation and tillage of surface soils. During the different growth stages, NO3--N and NH4+-N concentrations varied in the leachate and runoff. The NO3--N concentration had a greater impact on water quality during the R1 period of maize. However, NO3--N concentrations were too low to cause ground water pollution. The total loss of inorganic N to leaching and runoff was 1.68-5.96 kg ha(-1) among crops. Run off accounted for 63.4-73.8% of inorganic N loss. The amount of NO3--N and NH4+-N lost through leaching and runoff was generally greater during the maize season compared to the wheat season. During the form of nitrogen loss, the ratio of NH4+-N and NO3--N in the leachate was generally similar (the proportion of NO3--N during the maize and wheat season was 65.2-70.9% and 46.0-54.6% respectively). However, there was a predominance of NO3--N in the runoff (82.5-86.4% and 94.2-96.5% for the maize and wheat seasons, respectively). The NO3--N and NH4+-N losses through total leachate and runoff were highest in the FP treatment, followed by OPT and DMS, and finally STR and CRN. To reduce N loss through water transport, in parallel to ensuring continued high agricultural production levels, CRN and OPT in conjunction with wheat straw incorporation should be encouraged during maize production, while CRN and OPT should be encouraged during wheat production.

This paper examined the possible influence of tectonism and climate on six habitations of the ancient Vaigai River Basin civilization in South India, using multiple proxies such as grain size, geochronology and geochemistry of the sedimentary archives. The tectonic setting of the basin changed between the active margin and passive margin; the discriminant diagrams suggested varying provenance and changing climatic conditions over the mid- and-late Holocene. Tectonic activism and quiescence, base-level change in the channel morphology led to the burial/marooning of the first habitation surface. Overall, arid conditions were punctuated with catastrophic flooding and peak discharge (flood) destroyed the second, third and fourth habitation sites. These flooding events were characterized by moderate weathering (CIA) and high values of Al, Fe and Rb/Sr and low Ca/Mg in the sediment records. The abandonment/destruction of the fifth habitation also occurred during an arid interval (droughts), possibly caused by weak monsoon. Along with the interactions between tectono-climatic and fluvial geomorphic factors, the new results provided avenues to (a) check and recognize the archives for 8.2 and 4.2 ka-like events in this part of the world, and (b) the utility of integrated analyses to constrain on the civilizational histories of the mankind.

For the laboratory evaluation, lake whitefish were fed rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax in four laboratory tanks during a 133-d experiment. Based on a comparison of bioenergetics model predictions of lake whitefish food consumption and growth with observed consumption and growth, we concluded that the bioenergetics model furnished significantly biased estimates of both food consumption and growth. On average, the model overestimated consumption by 61% and underestimated growth by 16%. The source of the bias was probably an overestimation of the respiration rate. We therefore adjusted the respiration component of the bioenergetics model to obtain a good fit of the model to the observed consumption and growth in our laboratory tanks. Based on the adjusted model, predictions of food consumption over the 133-d period fell within 5% of observed consumption in three of the four tanks and within 9% of observed consumption in the remaining tank. We used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as a tracer to evaluate model performance in the field. Based on our laboratory experiment, the efficiency with which lake whitefish retained PCBs from their food (gamma) was estimated at 0.45. We applied the bioenergetics model to Lake Michigan lake whitefish and then used PCB determinations of both lake whitefish and their prey from Lake Michigan to estimate gamma in the field. Application of the original model to Lake Michigan lake whitefish yielded a field estimate of 0.28, implying that the original formulation of the model overestimated consumption in Lake Michigan by 61%. Application of the bioenergetics model with the adjusted respiration component resulted in a field gamma estimate of 0.56, implying that this revised model underestimated consumption by 20%.

The water resources carrying capacity is a crucial metric for assessing the urban moderate scale. Using a calculation model based on the water resources carrying capacity, this paper evaluates the urban moderate scale of 25 districts and counties in China's Dongting Lake Ecological Economic Zone and further predicts future trends using the GM-LSTM model. Results indicate that from 2010 to 2022, the urban moderate scale consistently fell below the actual urban population, leading to water resources overuse and water quality overload. Overall, the districts exhibited signs of overloading, whereas the counties showed a surplus in water resources carrying capacity. The distance coordination degree revealed a fluctuating downward trend, with most districts experiencing maladjusted development. Urban economic activity density is an important factor affecting the formation of water resources overload pattern. Predictions suggest that the urban moderate scale will continue to lag behind the actual urban population from 2023 to 2035. To achieve sustainable urban development in areas with relatively abundant water resources, it is crucial to optimize industrial structures, enhance technological innovation in wastewater treatment, and ensure that urban scale aligns with available water resources.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				FEB	2025	16	2					757	780		10.2166/wcc.2025.715	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2025.715													WOS:001435579900025

The DRASTIC model is applied within a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) framework, using seven hydrogeological parameters to generate a vulnerability map. Results indicate that most of the basin falls within "very low" and "low" vulnerability zones, with "medium" vulnerability observed in localized recharge-prone areas. Model validation is conducted using nitrate and total organic carbon concentrations, which represent pollution from agricultural and domestic wastewater sources. The spatial correlation between these indicators and DRASTIC output supports the model's reliability. Importantly, this research also integrates anthropogenic influences by evaluating the spatial distribution of agricultural, wastewater, and mining activities relative to vulnerability zones. While natural conditions suggest low contamination potential, the cumulative and long-term effects of these activities highlight significant risks in certain areas. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study to validate a DRASTIC-based vulnerability map for the Kesikk & ouml;pr & uuml; Basin while addressing anthropogenic pressures. The findings offer a practical decision-making tool for land-use planning and sustainable groundwater management, both regionally and in similar hydrogeological contexts worldwide.

Raingauges measure rainfall in a fairly straightforward manner. However, they measure what is falling on a tiny funnel, which is used to infer rainfall over a large area. Weather radars and satellite based rainfall estimates such as from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) provide new ways of complementing rainfall data from raingauges. These estimates of rainfall may differ a lot compared to the values measured at raingauges. Combining the diverse rainfall sources is not easy as they employ different measurement techniques and space-time scales. A method of merging these two rainfall products is explored in this study under the framework of Bayesian Data Fusion (BDF) principle. The usefulness of the approach has been explored in a case study on Lake Tana Basin of Upper Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. The merged data, along with the data from TRMM and rain gauges, were used in a lumped conceptual model of the study area. Visual inspection of the simulated and observed flow plots and statistical indices for goodness of fit were used to evaluate the predictive capability of the rainfall sources. The model results with the BDF rainfall showed improved prediction of the observed discharge. The results showed the capability of the proposed merging technique in estimating rainfall from diverse sources.																					978-90-824846-0-1				2015							5670	5674																WOS:000398996205091

Impact of the Anthropogenisation on the Metal Bioaccumulation and Distribution in the Spiny-Cheek Crayfish (Orconectes limosus Raf.) from Lake Goplo, Poland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of metals in the muscle and exoskeleton of the crayfish Orconectes limosus in order to compare them with other species of crayfish and crustaceans. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between the concentrations of the same element in the exoskeleton and the meat and different elements accumulated in the same tissue. Crayfish individuals were acquired in spring (May 2012) from Lake Goplo. Individuals with damaged claws were not analyzed. Due to the relatively low amounts of meat that was obtained from the abdomen of individual crayfish, material from individuals with a similar body length was combined; thus, there were ten samples of meat and the exoskeleton obtained on the whole. The muscle samples (about 12 g) were freeze dried in a Finn-Aqua Lyovac GT2 freeze dryer (Finland). Three replicates of each freeze-dried sample were acid digested with 1 ml of concentrated HNO3 and 1 cm(3) H2O2. Metal analyses were performed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with a Perkin-Elmer Optima 8300 spectrometer. The analyses revealed that the mean metals concentrations (mg.kg(-1)) in the meat of the crayfish and in the exoskeleton were in the following order (Zn (115.571) > Mn (18.825) > Cu (17.226) > Ni (15.472) > Pb (3.535) > Cr (0.769) > Co (0.551) > Cd (0.315) > Hg (0.138)) and (Mn (111.640) > Zn (11.355) > Ni (8.165) > Pb (6.695) > Co (0.595) > Cu (0.575) > Cd (0.379) > Cr (0.195) > Hg (0.0168)), respectively.

J	Arcone, SA; Finnegan, DC; Liu, LB				Arcone, Steven A.; Finnegan, David C.; Liu, Lanbo			Target interaction with stratigraphy beneath shallow, frozen lakes: Quarter-wave resonances within GPR profiles	GEOPHYSICS												Resonances within ground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection profiles recorded over shallow, frozen lakes located on an artillery and bombing range in interior Alaska originate near ice/bottom and freeze/thaw interface horizons and are similar to those caused by shallow utilities. The transmitted pulse spectra were centered near 280 MHz. Low-pass filtering differentiates the resonances from background scattering. The transit times between their onset and that of the overlying interface reflections correspond with spectral peaks predicted for layers with thickness of one in-situ quarter-wavelength, which we call quarter-wave resonance. The peaks are below 160 MHz, which is well below the transmitted pulse bandwidth and may occur as a modulation of a reflection sequence. Although the transit times cannot resolve both layer thickness and permittivity, reasonable values of permittivity give overburden layers above the targets on the order of 10 cm, which is consistent with the persistence of the resonances. Numerical models of metal objects beneath an interface between materials of strong permittivity contrast reveal that significant energy at the predicted frequencies requires cylinder diameters too large to be ordnance. However, strong resonances at the predicted frequencies result from flat metal sheets of 0.5-1 m dimension, and so we interpret the resonances to be caused by nonhazardous targets. Late winter is an ideal time to survey for targets in this area because the ice affords repeatable positioning for the antennas and thermal high-dielectric-contrast interfaces are then well developed. The bandwidth of the pulse we used appears ideally suited for both resolution of the shallow strata and detection of the resonances, thereby allowing the resonances to be checked against quarter-wave theory.																			0016-8033					NOV-DEC	2006	71	6					K119	K131		10.1190/1.2358404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.2358404													WOS:000242598600035
J	Charrière, E				Charriere, Elodie			Exploring the Intersection of Lakescapes and Military History	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE												The study of processes leading to the militarization of landscapes is a rapidly expanding field of research. While certain themes, such as the impact of conflicts on landscape transformation, have received significant attention, others remain comparatively under-examined. Specifically, the environmental consequences of military training activities on inland freshwater ecosystems in the context of war preparedness have been largely overlooked by historians. This topic, however, falls within the dimension of militarized landscapes, encompassing lakescapes and the related environmental processes that undergo transformation due to conflict preparation. This article aims to address this gap by exploring a specific typology of underwater munitions sites: former military training targets and ranges located within inland freshwater bodies, with a particular focus on Lake Michigan in the United States and Lake Neuch & acirc;tel in Switzerland. By contextualizing these sites within a historical framework and examining their commonalities and differences in training practices, this interdisciplinary research will discuss the current management-or lack thereof-of this military legacy resting at the bottom of the lakes. The aim of this research is to highlight how lakescapes have been transformed by military training and how such practices have environmentally impacted inland freshwater bodies. This study finds that these military activities were not concealed from the public, that they have environmental consequences, and that they consistently receive less attention than terrestrial sites.																			2514-8486	2514-8494				2025 AUG 3	2025										10.1177/25148486251363734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/25148486251363734		AUG 2025											WOS:001543053900001
J	Zhao, Y; Yu, ZC; Chen, FH; Ito, E; Zhao, C				Zhao, Yan; Yu, Zicheng; Chen, Fahu; Ito, Emi; Zhao, Cheng			Holocene vegetation and climate history at Hurleg Lake in the Qaidam Basin, northwest China	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												We present fossil pollen data and discuss their climatic interpretations from a 688-cm-long sediment core from Hurleg Lake, a freshwater lake located in the Qaidam Basin on the NE Tibetan Plateau, just beyond the northern limit of the East Asian summer monsoon influence. The reconstruction of the Holocene vegetation and climate history vias aided by modem surface pollen analysis. The 14000-yr chronology of the sediment core was controlled by seven AMS C-14 dates on plant macrofossils. The results of the surface pollen analysis showed that modem pollen spectra faithfully reflect the regional vegetation along a transect from alpine meadow to desert steppe and desert, so fossil pollen record can be used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation change. The pollen data showed that vegetation changed from desert before the Holocene to desert steppe dominated by Artemisia from 11.9 to 9.5 ka, desert dominated by Chenopodiaceae from 9.5 to 5.5 ka, and steppe desert dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae after 5.5 ka. This vegetation sequence indicates that climate was relatively wet before 9.5 ka, dry and variable from 9.5 to 5.5 ka, and relatively wet and stable after 5.5 ka. The climate pattern reconstructed from pollen data appears to be opposite to the paleoclimate pattern inferred at Qinghai Lake, 300 km east of our study site. That site shows a moist early Holocene during the insolation and monsoon maximum followed by a drying trend during the mid- and late Holocene. The contrast between the two sites suggests the importance of the position of the subtropical monsoon, the mid-latitude westerlies and interactions between local topography and regional climate. Our finding has important implications for understanding complex regional vegetation and climate responses to large-scale forcings in and central Asia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

New records of continental cyclopids (Crustacea: Copepoda: Cyclopiformes) from Eastern Siberia and Russian Far East	ARTHROPODA SELECTA												A brief description of morphological features of 7 species of cyclopids new to the fauna of Russia from the water bodies of Eastern Siberia (Eucy-clops (Speratocyclops) dumonti Alekseev, 2000, Ectocyclops polyspinosus Harada, 1931, Cyclops borealis Lindberg, 1956), Primorsky Krai (E. (E.) agiloides roseus Ishida, 1997, Megacyclops magnus (Marsh, 1920), Mesocyclops (Pilosomesocyclops) mariae Guo, 2000) and Kamchatka (Eucyclops (Denticyclops) euacanthus (Sars, 1909)) is given. E. (S.) dumonti was described from Mongolia, then found in North China and its finding in small lakes of Transbaikalia was quite expected. Most of the remaining species new to our fauna were either also described from neighboring countries (China, Taiwan, Japan), or had already been found there earlier (South Korea). The type habitat of two species of the genus Eucyclops belonging to different subgenera, E. (D.) euacanthus and E. (E.) agiloides is Equatorial Africa (Lake Tanganyika), and the modern range covers the tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World and, possibly, Australia. The occurrence of E. agiloides and E. euacanthus in Primorsky Krai and Kamchatka represents the northernmost borders of the eastern part of their ranges and, possibly, reflects the tendencies of their expansion, caused by the evolution of the last period of the Tethys Sea. Ectocyclops polyspinosus, described from the island of Taiwan, was later found in some countries of Southeast Asia and in Canada. Finding it in the Baikal region and Primorsky Krai, apparently, falls on the most western and northern parts of its range, covering the SinoMalay part of the Palaearctic. Two more species of cyclopids (Mesocyclops (Pilosomesocyclops) dissimilis Defaye et Kawabata, 1993 and M. (M.) pehpeiensis Hu, 1943) have already been encountered and their second finds confirm their presence in the fauna of the country and expand the areas of their distribution.					alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; Chaban, Olga/0009-0006-4136-8831													0136-006X					DEC	2021	30	4					503	520		10.15298/arthsel.30.4.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.15298/arthsel.30.4.06													WOS:000742652300006

Construction of Libby Dam was authorized by the 1964 Columbia River Treaty (CRT) between the United States and Canada, and in 1975 began regulating downstream flows for flood risk management and hydropower generation. Following cumulative impacts, the endemic Kootenai River White Sturgeon population collapsed and was designated as endangered in 1994 (U.S. Endangered Species Act). Subsequent Biological Opinions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service prescribed Libby Dam operations to provide springtime flow pulses for sturgeon spawning. These provided the unanticipated benefit of substantial seedling recruitment of native and introduced riparian cottonwoods and willows. The regulated flow regime was further adaptively managed to provide a more normative (natural) regime, to balance ecological functions with flood risk management and hydropower generation. The broadened ecological considerations would be consistent with the proposed priorities for the modernization of the international CRT. The observed responses revealed that (1) diverse aquatic and riparian organisms are dependent on common river flow characteristics; (2) a normalized flow regime provided substantial ecological benefits; and (3) due to multiple influences, hybrid ecosystems develop along regulated rivers, with a blending of natural and altered processes and communities. For other regulated rivers, we recommend that (1) high springtime flows be allowed, as feasible; (2) followed by the gradual post-peak recession; and (3) the maintenance of sufficient flows through the warm and dry interval of mid to late summer.					; Egger, Gregory/AAA-2961-2020; Rood, Stewart/H-7634-2019	Benjankar, Rohan/0000-0002-6018-8186; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2024	40	4					587	598		10.1002/rra.4255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4255		FEB 2024											WOS:001158030200001

Machine-learning model to delineate sub-surface agricultural drainage from satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Knowing subsurface drainage (tile-drain) extent is integral to understanding how landscapes respond to precipitation events and subsequent days of drying, as well as how soil characteristics and land management influence stream response. Consequently, a time series of tile-drain extent would inform one aspect of land management that complicates our ability to explain streamflow and water-quality as a function of climate variability or conservation management. We trained a UNet machine-learning model, a convolutional neural network designed to highlight objects of interest within an image, to delineate tile-drain networks in panchromatic satellite imagery without additional data on soils, topography, or historical tile-drain extent. This was done by training the model to match the accuracy of human experts manually tracing the surface representation of tile drains in satellite imagery. Our approach began with a library of images that were used to train and quantify the accuracy of the model, with model performance tested on imagery from two areas that were not used to train the model. Satellite imagery included acquisition dates from 2008 to 2020. Training imagery was from agricultural areas within the US Great Lakes basin. Validation imagery was from the upper Maumee River, tributary to western Lake Erie, and an Indiana, Ohio-River headwater tributary. Our analysis of the satellite imagery paired with meteorological and soil data found that during spring, a combination of relatively high solar radiation, intermediate soil-water content and bare fields enabled the best model performance. Each area of interest was heavily tile-drained, where better understanding the movement of water, nutrients, and sediment from fields to downstream water bodies is key to managing harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The trained UNet model successfully identified tile drains visible in the validation imagery with an accuracy of 93%-96% and balanced accuracy of 52%-54%, similar to performance for training data (95% and 63%, respectively). Model performance will benefit from ongoing contributions to the training library.

Potamoplankton of the Maumee River during 2018 and 2019: The relationship between cyanobacterial toxins and environmental factors	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												While algal blooms are common in eutrophic lakes, blooms can also occur in tributaries that load nutrients into the lake. We sampled six sites along a 122-km stretch of the Maumee River May through October 2018 and 2019 at weekly to biweekly intervals to determine if algal blooms occur, in particular toxic cyanobacteria, and to provide insights on potential environmental drivers of blooms. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of potamoplankton (=riverine phytoplankton), chlorophyll a, nutrients, cyanobacterial toxins, microcystins and saxitoxins, and cyanotoxin genes (mcyE and sxtA). Extreme precipitation in 2019 resulted in more high discharge events during 2019 than in 2018. Chlorophyll a ranged from 50 mu g/L to 300 mu g/L during periods of low discharge (<50 m(3)/s), and green algae and diatoms accounted for the majority of the chlorophyll a. In both years, cyanobacteria comprised a low proportion of all chlorophyll a, usually<20 %, but microcystins and saxitoxins were detectable in 38.7 % and 16.7 % samples, respectively, and mcyE and sxtA were detected in 36.2 % and 59.7 % samples, respectively. Therefore, cyanotoxins were present even when cyanobacteria were not at bloom densities. Chlorophyll a, cyanotoxin genes, and microcystins negatively correlated with discharge rate measured on the date of sample collection. Together our results suggest that cyanotoxins can occur in any portion of the Maumee River during low discharge conditions. Climate change is expected to reduce precipitation during the warm summer months in the Maumee River watershed and thus possibly increase the frequency of low discharge conditions that favor cyanobacteria.

To seek an integrated view of East Asian monsoon variability during the Holocene, an 8.5-m-long sediment core recovered in the depocenter of Dali Lake in central-eastern Inner Mongolia was analyzed at 1-cm intervals for total organic and inorganic carbon concentrations. The data indicate that Dali Lake reached its highest level during the early Holocene (11,500-7,600 cal yr BP). The middle Holocene (7,600-3,450 cal yr BP) was characterized by dramatic fluctuations in the lake level with three intervals of lower lake stands occurring 6,600-5,850, 5,100-4,850 and 4,450-3,750 cal yr BP, respectively. During the late Holocene (3,450 cal yr BP to present), the lake displayed a general shrinking trend with the lowest levels at three episodes of 3,150-2,650, 1,650-1,150 and 550-200 cal yr BP. We infer that the expansion of the lake during the early Holocene would have resulted from the input of the snow/ice melt, rather than the monsoonal precipitation, in response to the increase in summer solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere. We also interpret the rise in the lake level since ca. 7,600 cal yr BP as closely related to increased monsoonal precipitation over the lake region resulting from increased temperature and size of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and a westward shifted and strengthened Kuroshio Current in the western Pacific. Moreover, high variability of the East Asian monsoon climate since 7,600 cal yr BP, marked by large fluctuations in the lake level, might have been directly associated with variations in the intensity and frequency of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.																			0921-2728					JUL	2008	40	1					519	528		10.1007/s10933-007-9179-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9179-x													WOS:000257208600034

Religiously associated Manipuri Kombirei (Iris laevigata Fisch.): A new addition to the Indian flora	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE												Religiously associated Manipuri Kombirei or Manipuri Iris which is considered endemic to Manipur as per the Flora of Manipur (2000) has long been misidentified (misnomer) as Iris bakeri Wall. (Iridaceae) but after thorough investigation the botanical identity of this plant has been established as Iris laevigata Fisch. In India, I. laevigata Fisch. is the first report from Manipur, hence it is a new addition to the Indian Flora. During 1960's Kombirei plant was naturally growing in two wetlands of Manipur namely, Lamphelpat and Yaralpat but now it has completely vanished from its natural habitat due to various factors like habitat loss and invasion by weeds but a few hundred plants are maintained in captive farm at the periphery of Lamphelpat by a private cultural society viz., Ipathoukok. Currently, some plants are also recorded in small pockets from two wetlands of Manipur namely, Maibam Phumlou and Ikkop pat which is believed to have been established later by being brought down by the upstream rivers falling into the lakes. Manipuri Iris is religiously offered during the Manipuri New Year viz., Sajibu Cheiraoba as a symbol of eliminating caste system. Due to its habitat sensitivity, conservation of this plant should be prioritized, otherwise loss of this species from Manipur may lead to loss of a species from the Indian flora.																			0972-5938	0975-1068				JAN	2024	23	1					35	38		10.56042/ijtk.v23i1.8141	http://dx.doi.org/10.56042/ijtk.v23i1.8141													WOS:001198702800003

We applied Reynolds's approach to the study of phytoplankton ecology through functional associations of species to identify possible algal species, which associate with the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Previously an association among Synechococcus spp. and small-celled chlorophytes (association Z) has been recognised by evaluating phytoplankton associations according to functional criteria. 2. Biomass data for phytoplankton and picocyanobacteria from Lago Maggiore spanning more years were organised in a matrix and a cluster analysis was performed. The results showed four groups separated at a linkage distance of 0.20. Mixotrophic species which clustered with Synechococcus spp. were Ceratium hirundinella, Chrysochromulina parva, Cryptomonas erosa, Cryptomonas ovata, Dinobryon bavaricum, Dinobryon sociale, Rhodomonas minuta and Uroglena americana. The redundancy analysis (RDA) consolidated the association of Synechococcus with C. hirundinella and R. minuta showing greater probability of occurrence than random aggregates of species. 3. The association Synechococcus spp. -C. hirundinella also appeared from temporal variation of their biomass. In early summer both these species increased at the same time; later, the peak of C. hirundinella (potential predator) coincided with a minimum of Synechococcus spp. suggesting a possible predator-prey interaction. This implied that phytoplankton assemblages which form a functional group cannot only have similar adaptations and requirements but can also exhibit trophic interactions. 4. We propose to enlarge the association Z and create an association Z(MX) (where (MX) stands for mixotrophs) which would include Synechococcus spp. and C. hirundinella as the most representative of the mixotrophic species found in the oligotrophic Lago Maggiore.

However, very few attempts have been made (all in marine systems) to study the smallest cells belonging to these communities. In this study, we report on the quantitative importance and the vertical distribution of heterotrophic picoflagellates during spring in the oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin, using the FISH approach. The rRNA-based probes used, initially designed for two novel lineages of heterotrophic picoflagellates (i.e., the Stramenopiles NS3 and NS4) in marine systems, revealed high abundances (in the order of 10(4) cells ml(-1) and up to about 6 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) of the targeted picoflagellates in Lake Pavin, i.e. one order of magnitude higher than in seawater samples. 'NS3' cells were more often detected than 'NS4' cells, the average contributions of the two populations to the total abundance of heterotrophic flagellates being at 25 and 9%, respectively. However, the probes used were apparently non-specific to the targeted cells, implying that the occurrence of the two novel lineages NS3 and NS4 of Stramenopiles in freshwaters needs to be confirmed. Although, this study clearly confirms the occurrence, in high abundance, of small heterotrophic eukaryotes in Lake Pavin. In a near future, we believe that the availability of microbial clone libraries will allow us to improve our knowledge of the composition and the functional role of small heterotrophic eukaryotes in freshwaters.

This case study focuses on sudden expansion of Shishper glacier termini and subsequent formation of an ice-dammed glacier lake occupying similar to 3 km moraine following Mochuwar glacier retreat in the Karakoram. A method based on a combination of space (remote sensing) and ground observations is applied to reconstruct spatio-temporal glacier termini change and lake extent. Moreover, the likely glacier-mass losses are determined above and below the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) contours based on recommended values of Accumulation-Area-Ratio and Accumulation-Area-Balance-Ratio for mountain glaciers. Potential implications of glacier surge and ice-dammed glacier lake on downstream infrastructure and hydrological system are assessed. The results show that the Shishper glacier termini advanced 90% from 1980s to 1999 and 78.7% from 1999 to 2019 as compared to 188% and 421% retreat in the Mochuwar glacier termini for the same years, respectively. The current unusual surge of debris-covered Shishper glacier termini created a similar to 152 m deep ice-dammed glacier lake representing a total area increase of 500% over 6 months. The ratio of glacier accumulation to ablation is low for the Hassanabad glacier system, therefore there is a significant influence on forward movement of Shishper glacier termini. Water discharge from the glacier lake increased with increase in summer temperatures causing inundation of part of the Karakoram Highway at Hassanabad village. The current unusual surge of the Shishper glacier can be characterized as type-I as it involves an in-built unsteadiness without any regular intervals due to an unknown mechanism producing very high movement of debris-covered glacial ice and sediments.

J	Ding, YH; Ma, XQ				Ding Yihui; Ma Xiaoqing			Analysis of isentropic potential vorticity for a strong cold wave during 2004/2005 winter	ACTA METEOROLOGICA SINICA												Using the NCAR/NCEP daily reanalysis data from 1 December 2004 to 28 February 2005, the isentropic potential vorticity (IPV) analysis of a strong cold wave from 22 December 2004 to 1 January 2005 was made. It is found that the strong cold air of the cold wave originated from the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere of the high latitude in the Eurasian continent and the Arctic area. Before the outbreak of the cold wave, the strong cold air of high PV propagated down to the south of Lake Baikal, and was cut off by a low PV air of low latitude origin, forming a dipole-type circulation pattern with the low PV center (blocking high) in the northern Eurasian continent and the high PV one (low vortex) in the southern part. Along with decaying of the low PV center, the high PV center (strong cold air) moved towards the southeast along the northern flank of the Tibetan Plateau. When it arrived in East China, the air column of high PV rapidly stretched downward, leading to increase in its cyclonic vorticity, which made the East Asian major trough to deepen rapidly, and finally induced the outbreak of the cold wave. Further analysis indicates that in the southward and downward propagation process of the high PV center, the air flow west and north of the high PV center on isentropic surface subsided along the isentropic surface, resulting in rapid development of Siberian high, finally leading to the southward outbreak of the strong cold wave.																			0894-0525	2191-4788					2008	22	2					129	142																WOS:000257427300001
J	Zhang, FJ; Xue, B; Yao, SC				Zhang, Fengju; Xue, Bin; Yao, Shuchun			The lake status records and paleoclimatic changes of China since the Last Interstadial	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lake level changes respond to variations in regional water balance and thus it has been one of the most important indicators applied to reconstruct paleoprecipitation and paleoclimate. In this study, the effective precipitation and the atmospheric circulation during the past three key periods, i.e., Last Interstadial (30 cal ka B.P.), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 cal ka B.P.) and Mid-Holocene (6 cal ka B.P.), were analyzed based on the 76 lake-level records documented in the second version of Chinese Lake Status Data Base (CLSDB 2). The results indicated that the western part of China was characterized by elevated lake levels and expanded lake surfaces at 30 cal ka B.P., resulting from the strength of southwest monsoons. The high water stands appeared at 21 cal ka B.P. for lakes in western China were due to the enhanced intensities of Westerlies as well as the low evaporation, although the distribution extent of high lake-levels was reduced. For the period of Mid-Holocene, the lake stands of western China were relatively lower than those of the Last Interstadial and LGM, mainly as a result of shrunken Westerlies. Lake records from eastern China during the Last Interstadial and LGM were scarce, although there were a few reports showing higher or lower water stands compared to the present. A large number of high lake level records from eastern China were observed at the Mid-Holocene, which may be linked with the enhanced East-Asian summer monsoons.					zhang, fengju/JCE-0574-2023														1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 30	2019	527						12	18		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.023													WOS:000495356900002

Scott			Routine metabolism of larval and early juvenile lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and cisco (C. artedi) at three temperatures	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and cisco (C. artedi) are important contributors to Great Lakes ecosystems and to commercial and sport fisheries. Therefore, there is interest in understanding mechanisms that influence survival and growth, particularly recruitment declines beginning at early life stages. Routine metabolism is an important parameter in bioenergetic models to predict larval fish growth, yet there are few estimates of routine metabolic rate (RMR) for early life stage coregonines. We measured RMR of larval (<19 mm total length, TL) and early juvenile (19-29 mm TL) lake whitefish and cisco at three temperatures (8, 10, and 12 degrees C) to establish whether there are general differences between the two species or more specific differences in response to different temperatures. The metabolic rates of larval cisco were significantly higher than larval lake whitefish at 8 and 10 degrees C, but no species-specific differences in metabolic rates were observed at the early juvenile stage. RMR was positively related to temperature for both species at both life stages, although the magnitude of the temperature-dependent response was less pronounced for early juvenile fish than it was for smaller fish. With higher metabolic rates earlier in life compared to lake whitefish, larval cisco may exhibit higher growth rates if food resources are plentiful and may experience faster swimming speeds to search for prey and escape predators when resources are limited relative to lake whitefish.

To overcome this challenge, we use geomorphology to investigate landscape evolution and the role of different forcing mechanisms during basin development. Here, we focus on the humid Middle Shire River basin, located within the zone of progressive interaction and linkage between the southern Malawi Rift and Shire Rift Zone, East Africa. We used a digital elevation model to map knickpoints and knickpoint morphologies in the Middle Shire River basin and examined the relationships with pre-rift and syn-rift structures within the rift interaction zone. The main axial stream, Shire River, descends steeply, 372 m over a 50 km distance, across exposed metamorphic basement along the rift floor, exhibiting a strongly disequilibrated longitudinal elevation profile with both 'mobile' and 'fixed' knickpoints. In particular, we identify two clusters of mobile knickpoints, which we interpret as associated with baselevel fall events at the downstream end of the exposed basement that triggered knickpoint migration through the fluvial network since at least the Mid. Pleistocene. We infer that after the integration of the axial stream across the Middle Shire Basin, the knickpoints migrate upstream in response to fault-related subsidence in the Shire Rift Zone. Conversely, the fixed knickpoints are interpreted to reflect local differential bedrock erodibility at lithologic contacts or basement-hosted fault scarps along the basin floor. The results suggest that Middle Shire basin opening, associated with rift linkage, is likely a recent event (at least Mid. Pleistocene) relative to the Late Oligocene activation of Cenozoic rifting in the East African Rift's Western Branch. These findings support the hypothesis that the Western Branch developed from the gradual propagation, linkage and coalescence of initially nucleated distinct rift basins.

Physicochemical water conditions were evaluated along with the reservoir ecosystem health using a multimetric IBI model. Nutrient analyses of the reservoir showed a nutrient rich and hypereutrophic system. Guild analysis revealed that tolerant and omnivorous species dominated the ecosystem. Tolerant fish, as a proportion of the number of individuals, were associated (R-2 > 0.90, p < 0.01) with TN and TP, the key indicators of trophic state in lentic ecosystems. The mean Reservoir Ecosystem Health Assessment (REHA) score was 19.3 during the study, which was judged as in 'fair to poor' condition. A trophic analysis of the reservoir estimated by the ECOPATH model shows that most activity in terms of energy flow occurred in the lower part of the trophic web, where there was intensive use of primary producers as a food source. Consequently, of the 10 consumer groups, nine fell within trophic levels <2.8. Trophic levels (TL) estimated from the weighted average of prey trophic levels varied from 1.0 for phytoplankton, macrophytes, and detritus to 3.25 for the top predator, Pseudobagrus fulvidraco. Our integrated approach to trophic network analysis may provide a key tool for determining the effects of nutrient influx on energy flow pathways in lentic ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It consists of rhythmically interbedded coastal-plain and shallow marine deposits, reflecting repeated alternation of two markedly different environments, The formation is 128 m thick and forms an overall coarsening-upward unit. The basic moth is a high-order sequence, 0.1-10 m thick, consisting of a thin, laterally extensive carbonaceous mudstone overlain by coarsening-upward offshore-transition-zone and shoreface heteroliths and sandstones. The mudstone was deposited during early base-level rise in a shallow, hat-bottomed lake or lagoon on a flat, low-lying coastal plain. The plain was subsequently hooded during maximum rise in sea level, followed by shore-face progradation during late rise, stillstand, and early fall. The boundary between coastal-plain and shadow-marine deposits represents the maximum flooding surface, separating the transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The organic material of the carbonaceous coastal-plain mudstones is dominated by inertinite macerals resulting from wildfires. In the shallow-marine sediments the organic material contains a high proportion of huminite and a significantly lower proportion of inertinite macerals, indicating wetter conditions and a lower frequency of wildfires in the hinterland during times of shoreface deposition. The different climatic regimes may reflect high-order sea-level fluctuations that exerted an important influence on the areal extent of the marine environments in large areas of the rifted seaway between Greenland and Norway due to the flat, low-gradient basin floor and overall shallow-water conditions. Periods of late rise and highstand were characterized by a humid climate, possibly caused by higher precipitation in the nearby source areas related to evaporation over the extensive sea. During lowstands only the topographically deeper parts of the rift complex remained submerged and a drier continental climate prevailed. The carbonaceous mudstones were deposited in the transitional period from the drier to the more humid climate corresponding to early sealevel rise. This was the time of large seasonal variations with optimum conditions for wildfires in the vegetated hinterland. This time interval was also characterized by onset of base-level rise in the low-lying coastal plain, where the wildfire-derived inertinite was trapped in shallow lakes and lagoons.					; Bojesen-Koefoed, Jørgen/AAH-5501-2020; Vosgerau, Henrik/H-3046-2018; Petersen, Henrik/ABB-4663-2020	Bojesen-Koefoed, Jorgen Albert/0000-0001-5647-2769; 													1073-130X					MAR	2000	70	2	B				408	418		10.1306/2DC40919-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/2DC40919-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D													WOS:000086048500010

In addition, ponds and paddy fields artificially created for agriculture are also important alternative habitats for lotic water-dependent wildlife. In this study, we focused on aquatic insects in ponds in the Matsumoto Basin, located in the center of Japan. Although this is an urbanized area, aquatic animals adapted to floodplains inhabit it at a relatively high density for Japan. We conducted a multifaceted evaluation of the environments of the 33 ponds in this region and conducted a survey of the aquatic insect fauna inhabiting them. In this study, we conducted quantitative sampling, focusing on two insect orders adapted to large-scale lentic water environments (i.e., Heteroptera and Coleoptera), and observed five species of three families and 16 species of five families from the Matsumoto Basin, respectively. Within these species, eight endangered species were included. Furthermore, we carried out a genetic structure analysis for the giant water bug,Appasus japonicus, inhabiting these ponds in high density, and conducted a comparative evaluation of their genetic diversity between these ponds. A total of 530 specimens ofA. japonicuswere genetically analyzed for the mitochondrial DNA COI region, and 26 haplotypes were observed. The degree of genetic diversity between the ponds was clearly demonstrated. In addition, we discussed the wintering possibilities for the giant water bugs based on their corresponding surrounding environmental factors, and comprehensively discussed their "source-sink" relationships in this region. Therefore, this is a comprehensive study focused on the relevant environmental factors, diversification of their community structures, their population structures, and their genetic structure at a fine scale.																				2075-4450				JUN	2020	11	6							389	10.3390/insects11060389	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11060389								32586006					WOS:000553517800001

Blue-green space, integrating water bodies and green spaces, has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for reducing the urban heat island effect and enhancing the urban environment. However, there is a lack of coupled analysis on the cooling island effect of blue-green space at the meso-micro scale, with previous studies predominantly focusing on the heat island effect. This study coupled the single urban canopy model (UCM) with the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical model to simulate the cooling island effect of blue-green space in the Eastern Sea-River-Stream-Lake Linkage Zone (ESLZ) within the northern subtropical zone. In particular, we comparatively investigated the cooling island effect of micro-scale blue-green space via three mitigation strategies of increasing vegetation, water bodies, and coupling blue-green space, using the temperature data at the block scale within 100 m square of the urban center on the hottest day in summer. Results showed that the longitudinally distributed lakes and rivers in the city had a significant cooling effect on the ambient air temperature (Ta) at the mesoscale, with the largest cooling range occurring during the daytime and ranging from 1.01 to 2.15 degrees C. In contrast, a 5 similar to 20% increase in vegetation coverage or 5 similar to 15% increase in water coverage at the micro-scale was observed to reduce day and night Ta by 0.71 degrees C. Additionally, the most significant decrease in physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) was found in the mid-rise building environment, with a reduction of 2.65-3.26 degrees C between 11:00 and 13:00 h, and an average decrease of 1.25 degrees C during the day. This study aims to guide the optimization of blue-green space planning at the meso-micro scale for the fast-development and expansion of new urban agglomerations.

J	Paganelli, D; Sconfietti, R				Paganelli, Daniele; Sconfietti, Renato			Biodiversity loss in a small riverine wetland of the Ticino river (Lombardia, Northern Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Wetlands are heterogeneous habitats that include various biotopes with different formations, structures and geographical positions. There are many small wetlands in the Ticino river area around Pavia (Lombardia, Northern Italy), many of which evolve naturally and originate from abandoned riverbeds, isolated river meanders, oxbow lakes or small ponds fed by terrace springs or underground waters. We decided to consider the evolution of one of these wetlands, namely the topo oxbow lake. It had previously been studied 24 years ago (1988-1990), so we compared the results with those collected during a recent one-year investigation (June 2011-June 2012) on the following aspects: dimensions, hydrometric level fluctuation and bathymetry, principal chemical-physical parameters, hygrophytic and aquatic vegetation, and zooplankton communities. The resulting geo-morphological and biotic community changes are typical of riverine wetlands, thus supporting the hypothesis that this oxbow lake is following its natural evolution. Morphological changes in the oxbow lake should influence its biotic communities: the high plant biomass that existed in the past could be considered to have been the first step towards eutrophication, but the oxbow lake remained at mesotrophic level due to high biodiversity and dissolved oxygen levels in the water. Nowadays, the lower biodiversity in aquatic plants and zooplankton suggests a trophic level shift towards eutrophication due to the endogenous evolution of the oxbow lake. However, these ideas are not supported by the physical and chemical parameters of the water which indicate that the oxbow lake is still at mesotrophic level. We would suggest planning a gentle restoration of this biotope, with the aim of rejuvenating the physical habitat to ensure the long-term ecological functioning of the aquatic environment.					; Paganelli, Daniele/ABA-7729-2021	PAGANELLI, Daniele/0000-0002-8634-7368; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	3					573	581		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e48	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e48													WOS:000326626700016

Artificial substrates (concrete blocks, 0.49 m(2) surface area) were deployed on or around the first of May at two sites within each of two habitat types (main channel border and contiguous backwater). Blocks were removed monthly (30 +/- 10 d) from the end of May to the end of October to obtain density and growth information. Some blocks deployed in May 1995 were retrieved in April 1996 to obtain information about over-winter growth and survival. The annual density of zebra mussels in Pool 8 of the UMR increased from 3.5/m(2) in 1992 to 14,956/m(2) in 1996. The average May-October growth rate of newly recruited individuals, based on a von Bertalanffy growth model fitted to monthly shell-length composition data, was 0.11 mm/d. Model estimates of the average survival rate varied from 21 to 100% per month. Estimated recruitment varied substantially among months, with highest levels occurring in September-October of 1994 and 1996, and in July of 1995. Recruitment and density in both habitat types increased by two orders of magnitude in 1996. Follow-up studies will be necessary to assess the long-term stability of zebra mussel populations in the UMR; this study provides the critical baseline information needed for those future comparisons.					; Hightower, Joseph/O-5867-2019	Bartsch, Michelle/0000-0002-9571-5564; Hightower, Joseph/0000-0001-7208-7764; Cope, W.

Fish assemblages in the lower reaches, floodplains, and associated wetland habitats remain insufficiently documented. This study sought to compare fish assemblages across three distinct habitats within the wetland integral to the basin's ecosystem and expand checklist of freshwater fishes in Perlis River basin. A total of 58 species from 25 families were recorded during surveys conducted between January and September 2022 for Perlis River basin. Cyprinidae was the most abundant family (13 species), followed by Bagridae, Osphronemidae, and Channidae, with four species each. Species richness was highest for the upstream 1, followed by downstream, Timah-Tasoh Reservoir (TTR), and upstream 2. Fish assemblages varied significantly between habitats, forming distinct groups based on habitat types, as indicated by 2D-nMDS. The taxonomic compositions for 20 sites were relatively similar, except for four sites, which fell outside the funnel plot. The formation of the reservoir reduced native fish species richness and led to similar taxonomic composition, suggesting potential biotic homogenization within the fish community. Upcoming investigations are critical to better understand the role of wetland ecosystems and floodplains in conserving native fish diversity, sustainable fisheries purposes and mitigating the impacts of invasive species.

To extend its application to the acoustic scattering of underwater vehicles with complex profiles, a sliced highlight model was developed in previous works. However, for practical engineering targets, this model still falls short of achieving high accuracy compared with the Kirchhoff approximation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel highlight model that incorporates genetic algorithm (GA) adjustments to the shell surface reflection coefficient. By prioritizing the optimization of the reflection coefficients in each shell region over precise geometric approximation, this approach facilitates the rapid prediction of acoustic scattering for targets with complex shell structures. This study selected a benchmark model of an underwater vehicle. The target strength (TS) at various horizontal azimuth angles was computed using both the Kirchhoff approximation and the proposed modified highlight model, validating the accuracy of the approach. The modified highlight model exhibited an efficiency improvement of 200 times compared to the Kirchhoff approximation. Furthermore, scaled model acoustic scattering experiments conducted in a lake setting corroborated the method's efficacy. This technique provides valuable reference for the rapid prediction of acoustic scattering characteristics for underwater vehicle targets.																			0003-682X	1872-910X				JUL 5	2025	237								110766	10.1016/j.apacoust.2025.110766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2025.110766		APR 2025											WOS:001483733800001
J	Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rojo, C				Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rojo, C			Ecological goal functions and plankton communities in lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Descriptive studies have been the core of plankton ecology for many decades and will surely be fruitful in the years to come. However, the results that they provide are usually very difficult to adapt for predictive purposes. Other approaches will have to be taken into account, in the same way that the use of chlorophyll a has been used as an analogue in eutrophication studies. Ecological goal functions are the most recent candidates to fulfil the need for such compounded variables in plankton research. These relate some high-order ecological functions (energy flow, information, food web interactions) to ecosystem performance and can be considered as indices of ecological self-organization. Our study applies the concept of goal functions, which are functions that can describe the direction of ecosystem development, to lake plankton. Thirteen gravel pit lakes in Central Spain, without planktivorous fish and differing in trophic status, have been selected; their plankton communities, along with abiotic factors, have been studied during late-season mixing and mid-stratification. Size-spectral features (slope and intercept of the normalized biomass size spectrum), emergy (the quality of energy that increases since it is capable of controlling and causing work in the pelagic environment that would otherwise not be possible), exergy (the actual free energy of plankton biomass, including the free energy stored in information) and size-based connectance of food webs have been calculated on plankton data. Both emergy and exergy changed in response to mixing and stratification, emergy clearly increasing with water temperature. Exergy related to trophic status, whereas emergy only showed such a relationship in late mixing. The intercept of the size spectrum could be a good predictor of both goal functions during stratification. Connectance did not vary statistically between thermal periods. The hypothesis that connectance peaks at intermediate levels of trophic gradient no longer proved sustainable. Also, our data and those of other authors reveal that, despite earlier suggestions, no relationship exists between the slope of the size spectrum and trophic status. Some evidence suggests that goal functions, and hence self-organization, explain more than half of plankton biomass variability in lakes in summer. Exergy can be useful as a synthetic variable in plankton seasonal and long-term changes, emergy being a good proxy of pelagic ecosystem health, overall productivity and the food web. Thus, the application of goal functions along with size spectra to plankton field studies appears to be promising.

Turbidity is commonly used as an indicator for sediment resuspension and is proved to be highly correlated to wind speed in large shallow lakes. A field observation of wind speed and turbidity was conducted using a portable weather station and a YSI 6600V2-2, and an observation lasting for 39 days was evaluated in this study (the data points with wind speed > 4 m/s account for 75%). The daily average values (DA dataset) as well as daily maximum (MX dataset) and minimum values (MI dataset) were calculated from the instantaneous observations (IN dataset). Correlations in IN dataset were deduced based on machine learning methods and were compared to those obtained from DA, MI, and MX datasets. Furthermore, the correlation in IN dataset was analyzed by using two statistical methods, and from the view of statistical the turbidity is regarded as a variable. Results indicate that the correlations in IN datasets follow the exponential function or power function pattern with a critical wind speed of 6 m/s, Regression on IN dataset revealed that linear regression model had the best performance on predicting the turbidity in test dataset and no significant differences are observed between exponential function and power function pattern. Correlations in DA and MX datasets exhibit higher maximal information coefficient (MIC) than IN dataset and error of turbidity prediction introduced by using these correlations in IN dataset is within the tolerance level. Statistical analysis on the IN dataset shows that a strong relationship exists among the wind speed and expectation of turbidity with a MIC over 0.99, and follows the exponential function or the power function as well with a different critical wind speed of 4 m/s. Over 95% data points fall in the predicted intervals of turbidity for both methods, suggesting a high predicting accuracy.

At the same time, higher temperatures and prolonged water column stratification can favour the dominance of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton. Even when not toxic or grazing resistant, these prokaryotes lack phytosterols as essential precursors for cholesterol, the main sterol in animal tissues. Cholesterol plays a crucial role in the physiological adaptation of ectotherms to high temperature. Therefore, the shift to cyanobacteria-dominated systems may increase the vulnerability of zooplankton to heatwaves by intensifying cholesterol limitation. Here, we used death time curves that take into consideration the intensity and duration of a thermal challenge and a dynamic model to study the effects of cholesterol limitation on the heat tolerance of the keystone species Daphnia magna and to simulate the cumulative mortality that could occur in a fluctuating environment over several days of heatwave. We show that increasing cholesterol limitation does not affect the slope between time-to-immobilisation and temperature, but does decrease the maximal temperature that Daphnia can withstand by up to 0.74 degrees C. This seemingly small difference is sufficient to halve the time individuals can survive heat stress. Our simulations predicted that, when facing heatwaves over several days, the differences in survival caused by cholesterol limitation build up rapidly. Considering the anticipated intensity and duration of future (2070-2099) heatwaves, cholesterol limitation could increase mortality by up to 45% and 72% under low and medium greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively. These results suggest that the increasing risk of cholesterol limitation due to more frequent cyanobacterial blooms could compromise the resistance of zooplankton populations to future heatwaves. More generally, this study shows the importance of considering the nutritional context in any attempt to predict ectotherm mortality with increasing temperatures in the field.

Comparison of batch sorption tests, pilot studies, and modeling for estimating GAC bed life	WATER RESEARCH												Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) in Saint Paul, MN experiences annual taste and odor episodes during the warm summer months. These episodes are attributed primarily to geosmin that is produced by cyanobacteria growing in the chain of lakes used to convey and store the source water pumped from the Mississippi River. Batch experiments, pilot-scale experiments, and model simulations were performed to determine the geosmin removal performance and bed life of a granular activated carbon (GAC) filter-sorber. Using batch adsorption isotherm parameters, the estimated bed life for the GAC filter-sorber ranged from 920 to 1241 days when challenged with a constant concentration of 100 ng/L of geosmin. The estimated bed life obtained using the AdDesignS model and the actual pilot-plant loading history was 594 days. Based on the pilot-scale GAC column data, the actual bed life (>714 days) was much longer than the simulated values because bed life was extended by biological degradation of geosmin. The continuous feeding of high concentrations of geosmin (100-400 ng/L) in the pilot-scale experiments enriched for a robust geosmin-degrading culture that was sustained when the geosmin feed was turned off for 40 days. It is unclear, however, whether a geosmin-degrading culture can be established in a full-scale filter that experiences taste and odor episodes for only 1 or 2 months per year. The results of this research indicate that care must be exercised in the design and interpretation of pilot-scale experiments and model simulations for predicting taste and odor removal in full-scale GAC filter-sorbers. Adsorption and the potential for biological degradation must be considered to estimate GAC bed life for the conditions of intermittent geosmin loading typically experienced by full-scale systems.

The primary goal of collecting quality assurance data is to ultimately improve patient care. The VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) provides each station with risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality data on a regular basis. This report of one medical center's use of the risk-adjusted data shows how it can be used to improve patient care. Materials and methods. Risk-adjusted surgical outcome data for Fiscal Year 1996 (FY96) was received from the NSQIP coordinating center. The Salt Lake City VA medical center was identified as a high outlier for morbidity in general surgery. Patient charts were reviewed and data analyzed to determine practice patterns and to determine if there were any provider issues. Data analysis revealed a large number of wound complications and uncovered a practice pattern of closure of contaminated wounds. Using these data and data from the literature, wound infection and disruption prevention protocols were instituted in the fall of 1997. Wound complications from January to December 1996 (preprotocol) and January to December 1998 (postprotocol) were compared using Student's t test. Results. The total number of operations in 1998 was 719 compared with 634 in 1996. Superficial wound infections dropped from 3.6 to 1.7%, while overall wound complications dropped from 5.5 to 2.9%. None of these changes were statistically significant. Conclusions. Although introduction of wound infection and disruption prevention protocols did not result in a statistically significant decrease in wound complication, it did result in a clinically significant improvement in patient care.																			0022-4804					JAN	2000	88	1					58	61		10.1006/jsre.1999.5791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jsre.1999.5791								10644468					WOS:000085226100011

New cherry rootstock and cultivar interactions directly affect orchard profitability	VIII INTERNATIONAL CHERRY SYMPOSIUM	Acta Horticulturae				8th International Cherry Symposium	JUN 05-09, 2017	Yamagata, JAPAN	Int Soc Hort Sci				Due to increased production costs, Wasco County Oregon, USA cherry growers have found it difficult to remain profitable in recent years. Despite production increases in the last 30 years, average yields ha(-1) have actually fallen slightly to 10.5 t ha(-1). A newly developed cost of production study determined that at the average price received (US$ 2.14 kg(-1)), the break-even yield for 'Bing' cherries is 14 t ha(-1). New scion and rootstock cultivar releases have provided growers with the means to exceed this economic benchmark. In a rootstock trial in The Dalles, Oregon, 'Bing' cherries on 'Krymsk 5' rootstock yielded 21.0 t ha(-1) and 'Krymsk 6' yielded 21.7 t ha(-1) (5th-8th leaf). A new, productive, dwarfing rootstock series released by Michigan State University, named Corette (TM), consisting of five rootstocks: 'Cass', 'Clare', 'Clinton', 'Lake' and 'Crawford', also showed potential to significantly increase yields. The average number of flowers per leader cross-sectional area for 'Bing' on 'Gisela 6' was about 10 flowers cm(-2), but 'Lake', 'Clare' and 'Crawford' all had significantly more flowers with 'Lake' producing more than 20 flowers cm(-2). However, in order to produce quality fruit, fruit on all five rootstocks were thinned to obtain a standard crop load. No differences in average fruit size were found between the five Corette (TM) rootstocks and the 'Gisela 5' and 'Gisela 6' controls in 2012 and 2013. The Krymsk rootstocks produced sufficient yields for growers to exceed all costs of production and the Corette (TM) rootstocks have similar potential. In addition to rootstock effects on yield, differences between cultivars also have a direct effect on profitability. Newly released cultivars offer growers an alternative to low-producing cultivars. Data from a cultivar evaluation trial in The Dalles, Oregon is presented.

The chronology, presented herein, is based on Pb-210 and AMS C-14 dates from the macro-remains of plants. Reconstruction of vegetation types, temperature and moisture indices indicate that the vegetation was alpine meadow, under relatively wet and cool conditions, from approximately 100 to 780 CE Later, the vegetation between approximately 780 and 1400 CE was alpine steppe, with a warmer and drier climate prevailing during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Then, the vegetation during the period from approximately 1400 to 1890 CE reverted back to alpine meadow, under relatively cold and moist climate conditions, which may have corresponded to the Little Ice Age (LIA). Since the 20th century, an alpine steppe has dominated the landscape, developed under a dry climate with a lower effective moisture. Climate records from Yamzhog Yumco Lake have confirmed a cold-moist/warm-dry climate oscillation on the southern Tibetan Plateau over the past 2000 years. Comparison of pollen records with other climatic records suggests that the climate changes in the southern Tibetan Plateau were generally similar to those in the northern Tibetan Plateau, as well as those in westerly dominated Central Asia. Additionally, climate patterns were found to be the opposite of those in the East Asian monsoon controlled region. The temperature variations inferred from the records correlate well with changes in the solar irradiance and Northern Hemispheric temperature, which suggests a possible link between solar forcing and climate variabilities over the last 2000 years on the southern Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the enhancement and southward shift of the westerlies is determined to have significantly contributed to the high moisture conditions on the southern Tibetan Plateau during the LIA.

Terry			Population Characteristics, Morphometry, and Growth of Harvested Gray Wolves and Coyotes in Alaska	ARCTIC												Few concurrent studies exist of sympatric gray wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) harvest at far northern latitudes. Moreover, no studies explicitly examine effects of concurrent harvest on phenotypes of wolves and coyotes. We documented changes in sex and age characteristics and morphology of gray wolves and coyotes harvested by hunters near Ptarmigan Lake, east-central Alaska, USA, between 1998 and 2001. We hypothesized that the harvest would result in larger, heavier canids, reduce densities, and increase young to adult ratios in both wolves and coyotes. We generated von Bertalanffy growth curves indicating that wolves and coyotes of both sexes increased in length or weight until 2 or 3 years old. No significant changes in either mean length or weight or length to weight ratios occurred during the 3-year study, except that coyote mean length was longer over the last winter of study. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for wolves ranged from 0.061 to 0.112 killed/day and for coyotes from 0.552 to 0.11 killed/day over the study. CPUE indicated that coyotes but not wolves declined in abundance. Changes in male to female and young to adult ratios did not differ significantly for either canid. We posit that coyote populations were disproportionately affected by the conflation of the severe Arctic environment and sustained harvest. Our findings will be beneficial for managing sympatric canid populations and for understanding demographic responses to density-dependent processes in wolves and coyotes, especially at far northern latitudes.					; Aho, Ken/N-7885-2013	Bowyer, R.

J	Li, MQ; Tang, GP; Huang, HS				Li, Minqiao; Tang, Guoping; Huang, Huasheng			Environmental Studies Based on Lake Sediment Records in China: A Review	LAND												Lake sediment records are of great importance for understanding the evolution of watershed environments. Various studies have been carried out to determine the depositional ages of lake sediments and to examine their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The aim is to construct the historical vegetation, environment, and climate patterns in Chinese lake watersheds. In this review, we obtained relevant studies on lake sediment records by searching the key word 'age-depth' from the following databases: Web of Science and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, the largest Chinese academic database). We analyzed the literature based on its type (published in a Chinese/English journal or as a Master's/PhD thesis), period of publication, journal (if published in a journal), key authors, study area, dating scale, and main aims. The results suggest that the lakes in the plateau regions are the most popular research topic, typically covering 100-200 years (short-term) and 500-30,000 years (long-term). The literature focuses on a wide range of topics, from past environmental evolution in watersheds to lake ecology, and it provides a solid foundation for a better understanding of the regional climate change and the preservation of lake environments and ecosystems. In the future, the resulting data obtained from environmental reconstructions with lake sediments will need to be integrated with emerging information processing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and meta-analysis) to disentangle the complex interplay between the Earth's surface processes and global climate change; furthermore, strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration will deepen our comprehension of the man-land relationship and promote the sustainable management of lake ecosystems in the context of global climate change.					; Huang, Huasheng/AAE-3045-2019	Tang, Guoping/0000-0001-7992-2048; Huang, Huasheng/0000-0001-8764-9264; 														2073-445X				MAY	2024	13	5							637	10.3390/land13050637	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13050637													WOS:001232445500001

Chronological sequence of this core was established by twelve conventional radiocarbon dates and the bottom age was determined at ca. 16,000 cal year BP. Multiproxies demonstrate that terrestrial source organic matter may have played a more important role in contribution to accumulation of organic matter in Dahu Swamp than autochthonous source. Multiproxies support the interpretation that bulk delta C-13(org) record reflects carbon isotopic signal of allochthonous C3 plants on which atmospheric precipitation may exert a strong impact. Although changes in bulk delta C-13(org) of lacustrine sediments may be resulted from a mixing of materials with different delta C-13 signature and with different fraction, and the cause and mechanism leading to the observed organic carbon isotope responses are presently not fully understood, however, this study demonstrates that bulk delta C-13(org) record of Dahu Swamp sediments has the potential to reflect variation of environmental and climatic changes of the lake catchment since the Last Deglaciation, the more negative the bulk delta C-13(org) values the stronger the summer monsoon precipitation and vice versa.

J	Pothoven, SA; Nalepa, TF; Schneeberger, PJ; Brandt, SB				Pothoven, SA; Nalepa, TF; Schneeberger, PJ; Brandt, SB			Changes in diet and body condition of lake whitefish in southern Lake Michigan associated with changes in benthos	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the long-term trends of the benthic macroinvertebrate community (1980-1999) and biological attributes of lake whitefish Coregonus clupraformis (1985-1999) in southeastern Lake Michigan. We also determined what food types were important to lake whitefish in an area where the amphipod Diporeia had not yet declined in 1998 and how the diet of lake whitefish changed as Diporeia declined during 1999-2000. Zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha invaded the study area in 1992; Diporeia began to decline in 1993 and was nearly absent by 1999. The body condition of lake whitefish decreased after 1993 and remained low thereafter. The length at age and weight at age of lake whitefish was lower in 1992-1999 than in 1985-1991. After declines of Diporeia off the city of Muskegon, Michigan, between 1998 and 1999-2000, the proportion of Diporeia in the diet by weight fell from 70% to 25% and the percent occurrence decreased from 81% to 45%. In contrast, the proportion of take whitefish that ate other prey, such as Mysis relicta (an opossum shrimp), ostracods, oligochaetes, and zooplankton, increased in the same period. At sites south of Muskegon, where the density of Diporeia has been low since 1998, chironomids, zebra mussels, and fingernail clams (Shacriidae family) were the most important diet items of lake whitefish. Decreases in body condition and growth are associated with the loss of the high-energy prey resource Diporeia, the consumption of prey with lower energy content, such as zebra mussels, and possible density-dependence. Commercial harvests of lake whitefish will probably decrease because of low body condition and growth. Future management may require changes in harvest quotas, size restrictions, and depth restrictions as zebra mussel-related impacts spread northward in Lake Michigan.

In the northern Lake States region, research is in progress in the aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. grandidentata Michx.) forest type to determine effects of soil compaction and organic matter removal on soil properties and growth of aspen suckers, associated woody species, herbaceous vegetation, and on stand development. Four treatments: (1) total tree harvest (TTH); (2) TTH plus soil compaction (CPT); (3) TTH plus forest floor removal (FFR); and (4) TTH plus CPT + FFR were applied after winter-harvest of a 70-yr-old aspen stand growing on a loamy sand with a site index((age 50)) of 20.7 m. The CPT treatment significantly increased bulk density and soil strength of the surface 30 cm of soil and neither have recovered during the 5 yr since treatment. The CPT plots had 19.6 thousand (k) suckers ha(-1), less than half that of the TTH and FFR treatments; mean diameter (19.4 mm) and height (271 cm) were greatest on the TTH plots. The disturbance treatments (CPT, FFR, and CPT + FFR) each reduced biomass of foliage, stems, and total suckers compared with the TTH treatment. Total aboveground biomass (herbs + shrubs + suckers) was less than half that of TTH plots. There were 5.0 k saplings (suckers >2.5 cm DBH) ha(-1) on the TTH plots, but fewer than 1.0 k ha(-1) in the other treatments. The disturbance treatments decreased 5-yr growth of potential crop trees, delayed early stand development, and temporarily reduced stockability and site productivity of an aspen ecosystem.																			0008-4271					FEB	1998	78	1					51	58		10.4141/S97-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S97-026													WOS:000073319700007

Spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain: Influence of hydrologic setting	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] We used metrics of surface water and groundwater connectivity as explanatory variables in nonparametric regression models to explain the spatial heterogeneity in trophic status of shallow lakes. The concentration of chlorophyll alpha (Chl alpha) was used as an indicator of trophic status and was estimated from 17 Landsat images acquired during the end of summer (August) over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2003. A long-term median of Chl a was computed for each of 40 lakes on the basis of the 17-year data set. Hydrologic metrics explained 72% of the spatial variation in Chl a. The regression tree showed that lakes with a higher concentration of calcium plus magnesium (Ca + Mg) exhibited higher Chl a than lakes with a lower Ca + Mg. We hypothesized that this trend was a result of either higher internal nutrient loading in high Ca + Mg lakes due to groundwater discharge or differences in surficial geology. Among high Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with no inflowing streams had lower Chl a, while connected lakes had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting enhanced nutrient delivery to lakes connected to the stream network. Among low Ca + Mg lakes, lakes with larger wetland cover in their drainage basins had lower Chl a, while lakes with smaller wetland cover in their drainage basins had higher Chl a, possibly reflecting differential water loading rates between small and large wetlands that lead to either Chl a concentration or dilution. These results suggest that relatively simple hydrologic metrics can be used to predict the trophic status of lakes in this area of the boreal forest.

Late Holocene debris flows and valley floor development in the northern Zailiiskiy Alatau, Tien Shan mountains, Kazakhstan	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												This study uses geomorphological, dendrochronological, and archival research to investigate the pattern, chronology, and sedimentology of debris-flow deposits in two reaches of the Zailiiskiy Alatau range of the Tien Shan mountains, Kazakhstan. Steep and narrow low-order tributary valleys in this environment promote rapid coarse sediment transfer to trunk streams and, in wider trunk valley reaches, locally result in development of debris-now assemblages and terraced sequences of coarse-grained fluvial sediments. Since the mid-19th century the region has experienced 23 documented large-scale debris flows, including 14 in the study area, and these coincide with a period of climate warming. The majority of recorded events are attributed to the failure of moraine-dammed lakes, while the remainder were triggered by intense summer rainstorms. Landform-sediment assemblages investigated here have extended the documentary record by identifying at least 6 major debris-flow assemblages dating respectively from sometime before the early 17th century, ca. 1607-1633. ca. 1702-1728, ca. 1725-1751. ca. 1769-1795. and the mid-late 18th century. The geomorphological record of debris flows spanning the 17th to 19th centuries indicates therefore that high-magnitude events occurred also during the cooler climatic conditions of the Little Ice Age, although it is suggested that these events may have coincided with short-lived phases of glacier retreat. Debris flows in this environment may be considered as an important component of the paraglacial response to glacier recession, and this has clear implications for future patterns of valley floor development and its interaction with human activity.

In our study we focused on cyanobacterial blooms in lakes distributed over a longitudinal gradient in Central Europe during one of the "top ten European heat waves" in summer 2015. 92 lakes were included in the study, located across three climatic subregions: cool northern lakes, situated in Lithuania, temperate northern lakes in Poland, and warm northern lakes in Croatia. The objective of the study was to determine if cyanobacterial biomass, predominant species, and cyanotoxin concentration differed, across the south -north gradient, as a function of water temperature, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen. Statistical significance of observed patterns was tested using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and the generalized linear model. We found the lowest average epilimnion temperature, but the highest average cyanobacterial biomass in the northern, 'cool' lakes while the highest average temperature with the lowest average cyanobacterial biomass in the southern, 'warm' lakes. The concentration of cyanotoxins was also the highest in the 'cool' lakes. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen correlated significantly with cyanobacterial biomass, cyanotoxins concentration and biomass of some cyanobacterial species (mainly Planktothrix agardhii ), regardless of the latitude. Only in the 'cool' lakes concentration of cyanotoxins (microcystins and anatoxin-a) correlated significantly with cyanobacterial biomass and the biomass of some dominant cyanobacterial species ( P. agardhii ). Our results emphasized the differences of heat weaves impact on lakes of various latitudes, with the strongest increase in toxic cyanobacterial blooms in northern 'cool' lakes, situated in high latitudes. On the other hand, nutrients directly enhanced blooms across all the studied latitudes of Central Europe. The cyanobacteria species dominating in blooms might be recognized as ecological indicators of climate change, especially in the north-eastern part of Europe.					; Wasilewicz, Michal/JQJ-5370-2023; Pęczuła, Wojciech/T-6681-2018; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/J-8511-2017; Dunalska, Julita/I-3290-2018; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/AAO-9883-2021; Budziak, Martyna/NEU-0918-2025; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Bańkowska-Sobczak, Agnieszka/AFT-2442-2022; Frąk, Magdalena/AAJ-2651-2020; Budzyńska, Agnieszka/AAC-6860-2020; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Toporowska, Magdalena/AAO-6763-2020; Koreiviene, Judita/GNM-7260-2022; Grabowska, Magdalena/E-2079-2018; Zutinic, Petar/AGR-1031-2022; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/A-4218-2008; Maronic, Dubravka/AAH-3995-2021	Walusiak, Edward/0000-0002-6864-6153; Bankowska-Sobczak, Agnieszka/0000-0001-7709-6213; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Jasser, Iwona/0000-0003-0401-1463; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Budziak, Martyna Agnieszka/0009-0006-5011-7647; Budzynska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4983-1940; Szelag-Wasielewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-7542-6490; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/0000-0002-4929-6733; Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Koreiviene, Judita/0000-0002-8156-7548													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2024	160								111929	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111929		MAR 2024											WOS:001226481800001
J	ELSER, JJ; FREES, DL				ELSER, JJ; FREES, DL			MICROCONSUMER GRAZING AND SOURCES OF LIMITING NUTRIENTS FOR PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH - APPLICATION AND COMPLICATIONS OF A NUTRIENT-DELETION/DILUTION-GRADIENT TECHNIQUE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A series of eight nutrient-deletion/dilution-gradient experiments was performed in Castle Lake during summer 1993 to quantify and characterize microconsumer grazing and contributions of nutrient supply sources (external, cell quota, recycling) supporting phytoplankton production. Responses of net chlorophyll production rate to dilution under nutrient-saturated conditions were frequently nonlinear, indicating saturation of micrograzer feeding at low biomass levels within the dilution gradient (dilutions of < 10-30% whole lake water). Despite feeding saturation, micrograzers exerted substantial grazing pressure on phytoplankton: microconsumer grazing coefficients (0.05-0.22 d(-1), mean:0.14 d(-1)) exceeded previous measures of crustacean grazing in this system. Nonlinear feeding kinetics required that piecewise multiple regression be used to estimate contributions of external, cell quota, and recycling to N and P supply. In deep-water layers, phytoplankton were growing at nutrient-saturated rates, indicating that phytoplankton growth was more likely light limited. In the epilimnion, recycled and internal sources were important for both N and P in different experiments, but the importance of various supply sources did not systematically differ for N and P. Tn epilimnetic experiments, there was strong experiment-to-experiment variation in contributions of recycling sources of N and P, suggesting that resupply of N and P via grazers was decoupled. Comparison of phytoplankton responses to nutrient deletion in undiluted vs. highly diluted treatments indicated that inferences regarding frequency and magnitude of nutrient limitation, as well as identity of the primary limiting nutrient, depended on dilution.

J	Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL				Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL			Sulphate flux from an upland forested catchment in South-Central Ontario, Canada	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Net SO4 export from forested catchments will delay the response of downstream surface waters to decreases in S-deposition. In the Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario, net SO4 export from wetland-dominated catchments is largely explained by release of stored S from swamps, although similar net export from upland catchments requires an alternate explanation. To investigate possible sources and controls of SO4 export in upland systems, SO4 input-output budgets were calculated for a small (3.45 ha) upland, forested catchment in Haliburton County over an eight yr period. Temporal patterns of SO4 concentrations in soil leachate were significantly correlated with patterns in stream water, but expected relationships with deposition were weak. Instead, SO4 concentrations in surface soil leachate (LFH) appeared to be related to changes in soil moisture, and SO4 concentrations in LFH leachate increased dramatically in the summer, when warm dry periods were broken by rainstorms. Higher SO4 concentrations in organic surface soils were translated vertically down the soil profile; however, SO4 concentrations at the base of the soil profile (B-horizon) were much less variable than in the LFH, and appear to be modified by processes occurring in the mineral soil, likely adsorption/desorption reactions. Deposition is the major source of SO4 to catchments in this region, but SO4 export in stream water exceeded input via bulk deposition by at least 40% in every year of record. Net SO4 export from upland catchments appears to be a result of SO4 release through mineralization of organic compounds and desorption from subsurface mineral soil.

Altogether, 162 perch larvae (81 from both habitats) were collected to estimate the diet composition of gathered larval specimens in spring (2019) using gut content analysis via epifluorescence microscopy. Attention was paid particularly to the question how does the larval perch food composition differ in pelagic and littoral habitats. We hypothesized that the consumption of zooplankton is higher and the larval condition is better in littoral habitats. We assessed the feeding on both protozoo- (ciliates) and metazooplankton and applied multiple indices (Hurlbert's standardized niche breadth, Ivlev's selectivity and relative importance index) to evaluate, respectively, the larval fish prey importance, feeding homogeneity and strategies. The results showed that larval length and weight were slightly higher and body condition was slightly better in the lakes' littoral habitats. The feeding niche of perch larvae was narrower in the littoral, which can indicate more favourable feeding conditions in littoral than lake pelagic habitats. While the small cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris Muller) were generally the preferred and important food objects, ciliates were avoided and consumed only when their share in the total zooplankton biomass was >40%. However, in shortage of cladocerans, ciliates could be vitally important food objects for perch larvae.

Spatial distribution and migration pattern analysis of Erythroculter erythropterus utilizing a telemetry approach in relation to water quality in the Nakdong River basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The fish Erythroculter erythropterus has been introduced to the Nakdong River. It is a top carnivore (growing to up to 1.5 m long) but is inedible. The population of Erythroculter erythropterus tends to increase in areas where mainstream flow is slowed by weirs, likely due to the creation of more favorable habitat conditions. Erythroculter erythropterus dominates the fish community, reducing the number of endemic and commercial fish. The South Korean government sought to eliminate the species, but the spread was too rapid, resulting in top-down biological disturbance. The species distributions and movement patterns of Erythroculter erythropterus are not well known and no management strategy is available. Here, we determined the distribution and migration patterns of Erythroculter erythropterus in the tributaries and mainstream of the Nakdong River and analyzed how the water chemistry and physical habitat affected these variables. We used a submersible ultrasonic receiver to collect signals from transmitters attached to fish and analyzed the migration pattern. Massive aggregations of this species were evident at depth. Erythroculter erythropterus dominated all study sites but was significantly (p < 0.05) more common in the mainstream (relative abundance [RA] = 12.2%) than in tributaries (RA = 1.45%). Water quality parameters significantly regulated the population; total organic carbon was the highest one (R-2 = 0.71). The transmitters revealed massive congregations in the deepest water (- 17 m) during winter hibernation, which sheds light on how the fish can best be removed.

Population Dynamics and Distribution of the Lake Smelt, a Dwarf Form of the European Smelt Osmerus eperlanus (Osmeridae), and the Black Sea Sprat Clupeonella cultriventris (Clupeidae) while Cohabiting the Rybinsk Reservoir	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												The data for a 23-year period (2000-2022) on the population dynamics and distribution of the lake smelt (a form of the European smelt Osmerus eperlanus) and the Black Sea sprat Clupeonella cultriventris in the Rybinsk Reservoir have been summarized. The lake smelt dominated the reservoir pelagial from the 1950s to the mid-1990s. An anomalously low water level in the reservoir in 1996 and abnormal (for this reservoir) water warming in subsequent years led to elimination of the species from the reservoir ichthyofauna in 2002. The Black-Sea sprat invaded the reservoir in the mid-1990s; its population irruption occurred in the early 2000s (during the depressed state of the smelt population). Currently, this species dominates in the pelagial of the reservoir. Since the early 2000s there were noted two periods when the lake smelt was found in practically all parts of the Rybinsk Reservoir and the sprat abundance was also high. However, high water temperatures in 2010 and 2021, as well as low level in 2014, resulted in almost complete disappearance of the lake smelt disappeared. During the periods of cohabitation of the studied species, a significant similarity in the diet of individuals of both species with the size of up to 80 mm has been noted. The larger smelt fed on larger plankton, and in the summer also on fish. Currently, the main limiting factor negatively affecting the recovery of the smelt population in the Rybinsk Reservoir is the abnormal heating of the water column in some years.					gerasimov, Yuri/AAI-6171-2020; Базаров, Михаил/I-8615-2016; Komarova, Anna/AAB-4835-2019; Borisenko, Elena/M-2414-2017; Solomatin, Yuri/Q-9456-2016; Anastasia, Tarleva/AAT-1903-2020														0032-9452	1555-6425				OCT	2023	63	5					911	923		10.1134/S0032945223040057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945223040057													WOS:001087486200007
J	Aubriot, L; Bonilla, S				Aubriot, Luis; Bonilla, Sylvia			Regulation of phosphate uptake reveals cyanobacterial bloom resilience to shifting N:P ratios	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The resilience of cyanobacterial blooms challenges lake restoration programmes based on nutrient load reduction. The survival of organisms may depend on episodic short-term fluctuations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Insight into physiological responses to shifts in nutrient limitation will improve our understanding of cyanobacterial bloom resilience. This study investigated the resilience and collapse of a long-term cyanobacterial bloom dominated by Planktothrix agardhii and Raphidiopsis mediterranea, subjected to different periods of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (SRP) inputs in Lago Rodo, a polymictic, hypereutrophic (6.01.6mol total P/L) and turbid lake (attenuation coefficient: 4.71.7m(-1)). Phytoplankton composition, nutrient dynamics and physiological monitoring of [P-32] phosphate uptake kinetics were studied over four summers. The influence of environmental nutrient supply on phytoplankton net phosphate uptake kinetics was analysed with a flow-force model that gives the threshold value of phosphate uptake ([P-e](A)), a limiting concentration below which incorporation is not energetically possible by organisms, and the membrane conductivity coefficient (L-P). The [P-e](A) reflects the affinity and L-P the activity of the cellular uptake systems. Nutrient supply into the lake sustained high DIN:SRP ratios and high cyanobacterial biomass that showed P-deficiency features characterised by low [P-e](A) (5.4 +/- 0.5nm [P-32] phosphate) and high L-P. High cyanobacterial biomass persisted after external nutrient inflows were interrupted for 14months, which resulted in low dissolved DIN:SRP ratios; however, N-2-fixers did not develop. The collapse of cyanobacterial populations occurred under the lowest N:P ratios, low affinity and activity of phosphate uptake systems and strong water outflows. Our study suggests that the alleviation of N-deficiency under high N:P ratios enhances the activation of phosphate uptake systems by cyanobacteria. The flexible physiological response results in more efficient exploitation of limiting nutrients favouring cyanobacterial resilience under suboptimal conditions.

J	Mischke, S; Lai, ZP; Long, H; Tian, F				Mischke, Steffen; Lai, Zhongping; Long, Hao; Tian, Fang			Holocene climate and landscape change in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau foreland inferred from the Zhuyeze Lake record	HOLOCENE												Pollen and grain-size data from the Holocene Zhuyeze Lake record in arid Central Asia were re-assessed and combined with new ostracod species assemblage data to improve inferences of the lake history and controlling climate conditions. Zhuyeze Lake was a perennial freshwater-oligohaline lake since its establishment ca. 13 cal. ka BP. The lake level fell below the position of the QTL02 section site at 2.1 cal. ka BP after the beginning of the Han Dynasty, and we assume that significantly intensified land use upstream of Zhuyeze Lake was at least partly causing the lake-level decline. Most stable lake conditions and lowest salinities were recorded in the mid Holocene between 7.5 and 5.5 cal. ka BP, providing additional evidence for the inference of the highest moisture availability in the mid Holocene in arid Central Asia. The most striking feature of analyses of grain-size and ostracod data is the inference of more or less unchanged lake levels and lake water chemistry during a period of aeolian sand accumulation in the lake between 7.8 and 7.5 cal. ka BP. Similar conspicuous and apparently contemporaneously formed sand layers were recorded in other sections in the ancient lake basin and farther upstream, and mobilization of aeolian sands must have occurred for a few hundred years in the region. Indications for the 8.2 ka event from our section and other climate records in Central and eastern Asia support the hypothesis that a short-lived cold-dry climate initiated the increased activation of aeolian sands which was later on gradually enhanced as a result of burial of previously vegetated land by dunes and sand sheets. Further work is required to determine the regional extent of sand mobilization at ca. 7.5 cal. ka BP in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau foreland and to examine the timing and controls of the self-enhancing aeolian sand mobilization, vegetation degradation and subsequent recovery.

J	Miller, KG; Wright, JD; Browning, JV				Miller, KG; Wright, JD; Browning, JV			Visions of ice sheets in a greenhouse world	MARINE GEOLOGY												Backstripped eustatic estimates from New Jersey and the Russian platform show large (> 25 m) and rapid (< 1 my) sea-level changes in the Late Cretaceous to early Eocene (99-49 Ma). The largest of these sea-level events occurred at the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary (71.5 Ma); we infer that ice growth and attendant sea-level lowering at 71.5 Ma were as great as many Oligocene and younger events (similar to 40 in sea-level change). Glacioeustasy is the only known mechanism that can account for Late Cretaceous to early Eocene rapid changes because other hypothesized mechanisms (steric effects, water storage in lakes, deep-water changes, groundwater, or sea ice) are too slow or too small. In contrast to this evidence for glacioeustasy, ample geological evidence points to warm high-latitude temperatures at this time. The late Cenomanian-early Turonian delta O-18 record highlights the enigma. This was the wan-nest interval of the past 200 my, yet it was bracketed by two inferred eustatic falls of similar to 25 m that were associated with two large (> 0.75 parts per thousand) deep-sea delta O-18 increases (92-93 Ma, mid-Turonian and 96 Ma, mid-Cenomanian). We reconcile records of warm high latitudes with glacioeustasy by proposing that Late Cretaceous-early Eocene ice sheets generally reached maximum volumes of 8-12 X 10(6) km(3) (20-30 m glacioeustatic equivalent), but did not reach the Antarctic coast; hence, coastal Antarctica (hence deep water) remained relatively warm even though there were significant changes in sea level as the result of glaciation. Unlike the Oligocene and younger icehouse world, these ice sheets only existed during short intervals of peak Milankovitch insolation, leaving Antarctica ice-free during much of the greenhouse Late Cretaceous to middle Eocene. These results highlight the need to re-evaluate the paradigm that polar ice sheets did not exist during times of warm high-latitude climates. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Quade, J; Breecker, DO; Daëron, M; Eiler, J				Quade, Jay; Breecker, Daniel O.; Daeron, Mathieu; Eiler, John			THE PALEOALTIMETRY OF TIBET: AN ISOTOPIC PERSPECTIVE	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Stable isotopes provide a valuable perspective on the timing of elevation change of the Tibetan Plateau. We begin our paper by looking in depth at isotopic patterns in modern Tibet. We show that the delta(18)O value of surface waters decreases systematically up the Himalayan front in central Nepal by about 2.8 parts per thousand/km, in agreement with the patterns documented and modeled by previous research. On the Tibetan plateau itself there is no apparent correlation between elevation and the delta(18)O value of flowing surface waters. Both surface waters and soil carbonates display a northward increase in delta(18)O values, of about 1.5 parts per thousand/degrees north of the Himalayan crest, even though elevation increases modestly. The isotopic increase with latitude reduces the isotope-elevation gradient for water in the northernmost plateau to 1 to -2 parts per thousand/km. Carbonates in both soils and lakes form at higher temperatures than assumed by previous studies on the plateau. Temperature estimates from clumped-isotope (Delta(47)) analyses of modern soil carbonates significantly exceed mean annual air T and modeled maximum summer soil temperatures by 15.8 +/- 2.8 degrees and 9.7 +/- 2.5 degrees C, respectively. Similarly elevated temperatures best account for the delta(18)O values observed in modern soil and lake carbonates. We recalculated paleoelevations from previous studies on the plateau using both higher formation temperatures and latitude-corrected isotopic values. With one notable exception, our revised model produces paleoelevation estimates very close to previous estimates. The exception is the reconstruction from late Eocene age deposits at Xoh Xil, for which we calculate elevations that are higher and much closer to the current elevation than previously reconstructed. Therefore, there is no evidence for northward progression through time of Tibetan elevation change. Instead, the available but admittedly very scanty evidence suggests that much of Tibet attained its modern elevation by the mid-Eocene. A truly robust test of the various geodynamic models of uplift await expansion and replication of isotopic records all across Tibet, especially in the center and north and for >15 Ma.					; Breecker, Dan/B-4929-2011	Breecker, Dan/0000-0003-0200-223X; 													0002-9599					FEB	2011	311	2					77	115		10.2475/02.2011.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/02.2011.01													WOS:000290885700001
J	Bidleman, TF; Cussion, S; Jantunen, LM				Bidleman, TF; Cussion, S; Jantunen, LM			Interlaboratory study of toxaphene analysis in ambient air	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												An interlaboratory study was conducted for total toxaphene and selected congeners in an extract of ambient air from the southern United States. All participating labs were experienced in toxaphene analysis and used GC-MS techniques. Ten labs reported the concentration of total toxaphene in a technical toxaphene solution, with a 113% average recovery of the target value and 40% relative standard deviation (RSD). Only six of the 10 labs fell within +/- 30% of the target value, a criterion recommended by good laboratory practice standards. The interlaboratory RSD was 65% for total toxaphene in the air sample extract (lowered to 43% when one outlying lab was omitted). Nine labs reported the concentrations of five toxaphene components (B8-1413, B8-1414 + B8-1945, B8-806 + B8-809, B8-2229 and B9-1679) with 33-47% RSD for the technical toxaphene unknown and 34-62% for the air sample. The precision was poorer for a sixth component, congener 119-1025, which has a very low response by electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry (ECNI): 59% RSD for the technical toxaphene unknown and 196% for the air sample. Factors contributing to the interlaboratory variability for total toxaphene and single components are discussed, and follow-up studies are required to identify and minimize the causes of variability. Based on the average analysis, B8-1413 was enriched and B8-806 + B8-809 was depleted in the air sample relative to the technical toxaphene standard.

High-frequency analysis of dissolved organic carbon storm responses in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use, and is affected by changes in land use and climate. The effects of land use change (e.g. forest harvest) on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences. DOC is typically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors. In this paper, we investigated high frequency measurements of DOC concentration in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia. We found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear-cut stream (Clear cut: 2.26 +/- 0.43 mg/L; Forested: 4.30 +/- 0.83 mg/L). This may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, although the difference in drainage area, slope, and the presence of a bog lake in the forested catchment may also account for some of the observed difference. We found the DOC response to storms to be larger and faster at the clear-cut site (mean increase DOC: Clear-cut: 2.42 mg/L, Forested: 1.99 mg/L; mean rate of change DOC: Clear-cut: 0.16 mg/L/h, Forested: 0.11 mg/L/h). Elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting. We found low antecedent flow and greater storm intensity to significantly predict elevated DOC storm response. This is important in the context of future climate scenarios, which predict lower summer flows and more intense storms in this region. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the intersection between effects of land use change and climate on water quality, with a focus on drinking water treatment implications.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Chen, JA; Zeng, Y				Zhu ZhengJie; Chen JingAn; Zeng Yan			Paleotemperature variations at Lake Caohai, southwestern China, during the past 500 years: Evidence from combined δ 18O analysis of cellulose and carbonates	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The oxygen isotopic values of aquatic plant cellulose and carbonates in Lake Caohai sediments were measured using a continuous flow isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS). Because of predictable oxygen isotopic fractionation between cellulose and its source water, the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-lake water has been established quantitatively. Combined oxygen isotopic values of cellulose and carbonates were used in the 'Craig' equation to determine paleotemperatures and their variation in the lake during the past 500 years. Results show that the paleotemperature trend correlates well with meteorological records from Weining. There are four notable cold intervals at Lake Caohai over the past 500 years, namely 1540-1570AD, 1670-1715AD, 1780-1870AD and 1900-1930AD, and the former three cold intervals have been observed in the conventional Little Ice Age (LIA). These cold periods at Lake Caohai correspond well with those recorded from tree ring, peat, and ice core data from adjacent regions, particularly temperature those inferred from delta O-18 of peat cellulose from Hongyuan Southwestern China. The trend in paleotemperature variations at Lake Caohai are also consistent with both the change of Indian summer monsoon, derived from delta O-18 values of a stalagmite in Dongge, and a recorded shift in solar activity. The findings of this study illustrate that coupled analysis of delta O-18 values of cellulose and carbonates from lake sediments may be used as a paleotemperature proxy. These results also provide further evidence of the existence of LIA in southwestern China.																			1674-7313	1869-1897				JUN	2014	57	6					1245	1253		10.1007/s11430-014-4831-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-014-4831-6													WOS:000336380400011
J	Gonsiorczyk, T; Casper, P; Koschel, R				Gonsiorczyk, T; Casper, P; Koschel, R			Mechanisms of phosphorus release from the bottom sediment of the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin: Importance of the permanently oxic sediment surface	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The vertical distribution of various P-binding forms, potential P-binding partners and the concentration of soluble reactive P in the interstitial water were investigated in the bottom sediments of the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (north-eastern Ger many). The most important fraction of total P in the top centimeter of the sediment is the redox-sensitive Fe- and Mn-bound P with 1.29 g/kg (54 % total P), which decreased to about 0.23 g/kg at a depth of 10-30cm. Its decrease is responsible for a corresponding decrease in total P with depth. The release of P due to diagenesis of labile P-compounds was calculated to be 69 mg P m(-2) a(-1). This is concordant with the mean accumulation rate of soluble reactive P in the hypolimnion during summer stratification (70 mg P m(-2) a(-1)). The mobilization of reductant-soluble P due to the shift of the top oxic sediment layers into deeper anoxic zones (burial) accounts for 81 % of the calculated P-release of labile P-compounds (86 mg P m(-2) a(-1), 1970-1996). Although, reductant-soluble P does not add to the permanent burial of P, the thickness of the top oxic sediment layer and its redox-dependent P-binding capacity influence the present concentration of P in the whole water body, and thus contribute to maintaining the oligotrophic status of Lake Stechlin.

The aim of this study was to analyze the horizontal distribution of richness and abundance of rotifers, their diel distribution patterns, and the relative importance of physical and biotic characteristics as their shaping factors, in a subtropical shallow vegetated lake of the Parana River floodplain (Argentina). Three sampling stations were located along the major axis of the lake, one in open waters and two in littoral area dominated by the emergent Panicum elephantipes, Cyperus alternifolius and floating mats of the filamentous algae Cladophora spp. Two further stations were located on the transverse axis. Rotifer samples were taken on four occasions (at noon and midnight) during a five week period in the summer to avoid possible changes in the pattern of distribution of macrophytes and hydrological variability of the lake. Rotifer richness was higher in the littoral zone whereas rotifer abundance was higher in the limnetic zone. Some rotifers, such as Brachionus havanaensis and Keratella tropica exhibited changes in their diel horizontal distribution with higher concentrations of organisms at vegetated zones during the day time. In contrast, Polyarthra sp. were more abundant at night-time in both limnetic and littoral areas. The heterogeneous horizontal distribution of rotifers cannot be explained by the rather homogeneous distribution of both physical environmental factors and phytoplankton abundance. Rotifer distribution may be related to a complex of factors including the presence or absence of vegetation, the relatively uniform distribution of visual predators (fishes) and the heterogeneous distribution of non-visual predators (insects and shrimps).

The reverse primer was supplied with a GC rich region in the 5 ' end in order to make the PCR product suitable for analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). PCR product was obtained from all the kinetoplastids tested and no PCR product was obtained from any other Eukaryotes or Prokaryotes tested. It was possible to distinguish between all pure cultures of kinetoplastids by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in gels ranging from 20% to 60% denaturants. PCR-DGGE analysis of DNA purified from lake sediment revealed approximately 20 bands indicating high kinetoplastid diversity. Direct cloning and sequencing of 24S rDNA sequences retrieved from the lake sediment by PCR also showed high kinetoplastid diversity. Of 43 clones, 27 different sequences were found. Alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that a majority of the sequences were most closely related to the Bodonidae. Four sequences were closer to the Trypanosomatidae, whereas three sequences fell outside both groups. The PCR-DGGE procedure developed in this study has been shown to be useful for distinguishing between different kinetoplastid species. Thus, it may be a useful tool for evaluating the genetic diversity of this group in environmental samples, e.g., as a result of perturbation. Another possible application of this method is in fast and accurate screening for the presence and identification of pathological parasitic Kinetoplastida from environmental samples and for diagnostics of human and animal infections.

Forest birds and forest management in Ontario: Status, management, and policy	FORESTRY CHRONICLE												This paper presents a summary of presentations and discussions at a 3-day workshop on research and management of forest birds in Ontario forests. While many forest birds in Ontario do not appear to be negatively affected over the long term by forest management, some species were noted as declining using Breeding Bird Atlas data and more research is required to understand the causes, some of which may well be related to habitat change on the wintering grounds. For example, the aerial foragers as a group have declined significantly during the past 20 years. Recent research suggests landscape convergence between managed and fire-origin stands for bird species over time, but negative effects were suggested for boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonsicus), brown creeper (Certhia familiaris), and some cavity-users, although there is no evidence of declines in these species from the current atlas data. This inconsistency needs to be evaluated. In Carolinian forests, even small-scale tree harvesting in this already highly fragmented landscape can have deleterious effects on breeding success for some species, such as wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and rose-breasted grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus). New modelling techniques and meta-analyses seem to hold considerable promise as tools to help managers understand key habitats, species that require special attention, and as predictive models of forest management effects. A large number of recommendations to improve the management of forest birds are provided and as is a suggested research agenda to improve our understanding of key factors affecting birds in managed forests.

J	Gualtieri, L; Glushkova, O; Brigham-Grette, J				Gualtieri, L; Glushkova, O; Brigham-Grette, J			Evidence for restricted ice extent during the last glacial maximum in the Koryak Mountains of Chukotka, far eastern Russia	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Field evidence in the Koryak Mountains-Lake Mainitz region of far eastern Russia supports three Pleistocene glacial advances. The early Wisconsinan and pre-Wisconsinan glaciations are represented by broad lobate moraines extending as much as 30 km north of the Koryak Mountains. Field evidence demonstrates that the terminal, lateral, and medial moraines, as well as meltwater channels, dead ice topography, kettles, and other ash plains mark the extent of ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM), during which glaciers reached no more than 20 km beyond their present limits. Those emanating from the southern Koryak Mountains may have reached the Bering Sea, Numerical and relative dating techniques support these results and test the theoretical models of the LGM in western Beringia, Erratics on moraines and glaciofluvial terraces, common to all valleys at 13-13.8 m above river level, yield (CI)-C-36 exposure ages ranging from 10.08 to 25.78 ka, The Koryak Mountains-Lake Mainitz record of glaciation is spatially and temporally consistent with the glaciation pattern across central Beringia found in other terrestrial and marine records, Glacier growth in the Koryak Mountains was sustained by possible increased summer sea surface temperatures and precipitation in the northwest Pacific region, Evidence from the northern Koryak Mountains (lat 64 degrees"N, long 177 degrees E) indicates that the extent of ice in western Beringia was limited to mountain and valley glaciers during the LGM. This field-based research contradicts M.G.

This study provides preliminary estimates of contemporary (1961-1990) global green water flows (i.e. plant transpiration), using a well-established, process-based dynamic global vegetation and water balance model, LPJ. Transpiration is analysed with respect to differences between a simulation that accounts for human land cover changes and a simulation under conditions of potential natural vegetation. We found that historic land cover change usually reduced the green water flow to the atmosphere, resulting in a global decrease of similar to 7% in total. To further explore how the biophysical setting influences the green water flow, we analyse the ratio between soil moisture-limited canopy conductance of carbon and water and energy-controlled potential conductance. This plant physiology-based ratio measures the degree to which actual green water flow falls below the potential flow that would occur when the soil is saturated, thus it represents a measure of the water limitation of terrestrial vegetation. We found that plant water limitation is lowest in the wet tropics and at high latitudes, where soil moisture is high enough to meet the atmospheric demand for transpiration. The present results are preliminary, since irrigation is not yet accounted for, and because the model simulations are compromised primarily by the quality of the input data. A more comprehensive and consistent assessment of global green and blue water flows and limitations using an enhanced LPJ model is identified as a prime task for future studies.

Sediment samples of a 2.6 m trench from Barhatubi area located in the lower flood plain of Mahanadi River delta were studied for sedimentological and pollen analysis. Mangrove succession can be divided into three zones: (1) Freshwater marsh (similar to 1980-1420 cal yr BP); (2) Tidal flat (similar to 1420-770 cal yr BP) and (3) Landward mangrove margin (similar to 770 cal yr BP-Present). A transgressive shift from floodplain freshwater marsh to a tidal flat is recorded between similar to 1980-1420 cal yr BP which is evidenced by upland tree taxa, Poaceae, pteridophyte and fungal spores along with low percentage of mangroves such as Avicennia, Sonneratia and Rhizophora representing the landward edge of the tidal region. Dominance of Sonneratia and a decline in terrestrial taxa reflects a rise in the relative sea level around similar to 1420 cal yr BP with less freshwater input from land suggesting a weakened monsoon condition. After similar to 770 cal yr BP, an overall regressive phase with small cycles of relative sea level rise/fall has been observed due to the dominance of salt tolerant Avicennia along with Rhizophora, Excoecaria agallocha and Aegialitis rotundifolia alternating with Sonneratia and other marine palynomorphs.

The recent spread of Typha and Phragmites in the lake changed diversity and composition of the plant communities. Nine years after their first monitoring (2009), a rarefaction of hydrophytes and small helophytes of conservation interest was detected. In 2010, the restoration started with the aim to remove (or at least reduce) the populations of the large, expansive helophytes. In 2012, the first post-actions monitoring were carried out using the same methods as previously, analysing the plant presence/absence and their cover value recorded in the same 15 plots selected in 2000 and 2009. The rise and fall of the populations of the various flora and vegetation types during this invasion process and the following restoration were statistically analysed. One year following the restoration, some recovery (replacement) had occurred of autochthonous hydrophytes and small helophytes. Many of these species are of conservation interest. Some aquatic plants, present on the site until the more or less recent past, were once more recorded. Given the rapid recovery of populations of many autochthonous species, the results are reasonably encouraging, rendering planned reintroductions unnecessary at the moment. On the other hand, because of the short time elapsed since restoration, the current community structure cannot in any way be considered an "equilibrium" one. Continued and regular monitoring is required to allow the reestablishment of the large expansive helophytes populations.					; Foggi, Bruno/ABI-4405-2020; Viciani, Daniele/A-1668-2008; Viciani, Daniele/ADD-5900-2022	Benesperi, Renato/0000-0003-4296-3393; Viciani, Daniele/0000-0003-3422-5999; Lastrucci, Lorenzo/0000-0003-4455-389X; Foggi, bruno/0000-0001-6451-4025													0006-3088	1336-9563				AUG	2014	69	8					977	985		10.2478/s11756-014-0400-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-014-0400-x													WOS:000340583100004

Nowadays, remote sensing is widely used to monitor algal blooms in lakes due to the macroscopic, fast, real-time characteristics. However, it is often difficult to distinguish between algal blooms and aquatic vegetation due to their similar spectral characteristics. In this paper, we used modified vegetation presence frequency index (VPF) based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery to distinguish algal blooms from aquatic vegetation, and analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation from a phenological perspective for five large natural lakes with frequent algal bloom outbreaks in China from 2019 to 2020. We simplified the VPF method to make it with a higher spatial transferability so that it could be applied to other lakes in different climatic zones. Through accuracy validation, we found that the modified VPF method can effectively distinguish between algal blooms and aquatic vegetation, and the results vary from lake to lake. The highest accuracy of 97% was achieved in Hulun Lake, where the frequency of algal outbreaks is low and the extent of aquatic vegetation is stable, while the lowest accuracy of 76% was achieved in Dianchi Lake, which is rainy in summer and the lake is small. Analyses suggests that the time period when algal blooms occur most frequently might not coincide with that when they have the largest area. However, in most cases these two are close in terms of time period. The modified VPF method has a broad scope of application, is easy to implement, and has a high practical value. Furthermore, the method could be established using only a small amount of measured data, which is useful for water quality monitoring on large spatial scales.

The internal and watershed controls on hypolimnetic sediment phosphorus release in Lake Auburn, Maine, USA. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00-00.Lake Auburn, Maine, USA, is a historically oligotrophic lake serving as a drinking water source. In 2011-2012, epilimnetic total phosphorus (P) concentrations, turbidity, and cyanobacteria blooms increased. This water quality decline was linked to earlier onset, and increased extent, of late-summer hypolimnetic anoxia, causing internal P loading from lake sediment. This study evaluated chemical P speciation in hypolimnetic sediment, using the Psenner method for sequential chemical extractions, and watershed roles in controlling sediment P release. Surficial sediments (0-2cm) are high in reducible Fe hydroxide (107-1267 mu mol/g) and associated P (15-103 mu mol/g), and relatively low in Al hydroxide (77-242 mu mol/g). Previous research has shown sediment with molar Al:reducible Fe ratios <3 and Al hydroxide:reducible Fe-bound P < 25 to act as a source of P during anoxia. Lake Auburn surface sediment has molar Al hydroxide:reducible Fe hydroxide ratios between 0.2 and 1.7, and molar Al hydroxide:reducible Fe hydroxide-bound P ratios between 2.0 and 14.5, indicating high risk for internal P loading. Al concentration decreases downstream from catchment lakes and along Lake Auburn tributaries, while Fe export from upstream wetlands is high. The decrease in Al and proportionately greater increase in Fe flux to the lake and in-lake deposition of Al and Fe hydroxides are impacting sediment chemistry, increasing the lake's vulnerability to eutrophication following the onset of hypolimnetic anoxia. Understanding the significance of these critical sediment ratios and influences from watershed sources is imperative for lake managers dealing with systems having significant internal recycling of phosphorus.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2018	34	3					258	269		10.1080/10402381.2018.1423588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2018.1423588													WOS:000445258100004

Inflow and outflow characteristics including nutrient and bacteria concentrations along with physicochemical properties (discharge, pH, oxidation reduction potential, temperature, and specific conductance) were assessed approximately monthly for over 2 years. The median exports of phosphate (0.03 mg/s) and E. coli (5807 MPN/s) leaving the wetland were 85% and 57% lower, respectively, relative to inflow loadings, and the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Hydraulic head readings from three piezometers installed at different depths revealed the wetland was a recharge area. Phosphate and E. coli concentrations were significantly greater in the shallowest piezometer relative to the deepest one, suggesting treatment occurred during infiltration. However, severe erosion of the outlets is threatening the stability of the wetland. Upstream drainageway modifications were implemented to slow runoff, and septic system repairs and maintenance activities were implemented to improve water quality reaching the wetland and Lick Creek. However, more work will be needed to conserve the ecosystem services provided by the wetland.

Epistolography as storytelling and testament	ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI												Of Armenian descent, though born in Padua and educated in Italy, Vittoria Aganoor (1855-1910) would travel along the peninsula from north to south, spending the last years of her life between Perugia and Magione-Monte del Lago. Along with lyric poetry, letters will play a central role in her experience as a writer, as evidence of a way of life in a pre-technological society. These are pages, some of which are still unpublished, on which this contribution intends to dwell, registering first of all the character of a female narrative, on which movements and encounters affect, highlighting the spirit of a woman who is free and lively, melancholic and tormented, inclined to introject feelings and ideals on which her soul will be nourished. It is also to be noted that the years spent in Umbria, since the dawn of the new century, will constitute a happy part of her existence, witnessed by her falling in love with that land and the landscape, particularly the muffled landscape of Lake Trasimeno, which she will be able to capture with the sensitivity and refinement of an uncommon humanistic education. Traits that still emerge from the correspondences entertained with prominent figures in early 20th-century literary-worldly society, in which Aganoor occupies a non-secondary role, thanks to her aristocratic origins and her subsequent marriage to Perugian deputy Guido Pompilj.

Here we present a record of lake level variations at Orog Nuur in the Valley of Gobi Lakes in southern Mongolia, since the last interglaciation, based on paleo-shoreline dating using quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and Kfeldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) signals. Due to feldspar contamination that could not be eliminated, the OSL signals of quartz single-aliquots (SA), except for two Holocene samples, were unsuitable for dating and a double SA regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol was used for the quartz fraction of these two samples. The pIR50IR170 and pIR200IR290 signals of K-feldspar SA were used to date Holocene samples and old samples (>100 ka), respectively, with the SAR protocol. To determine the bleaching condition of the pIR200IR290 signals, the first pIRIR dating of K-feldspar single-grains of lake shoreline sediments in Mongolia was performed. The equivalent doses of K-feldspar grains show normal distributions, suggesting that the pIR200IR290 signals are well-bleached. Overall, the results, combined with those of previous studies, show that a mega-lake developed at 56 m above the modern lake level (a.m.l.) during MIS 5e (124.2 +/- 6.8-114.7 +/- 8.0 ka). Holocene high-stands occurred in the last deglaciation-early Holocene (11.1 +/- 1.0 ka) at 23 m a.m.l. and in the midHolocene (6.7 +/- 0.8-3.3 +/- 0.4 ka) at 20-14 m a.m.l. The dimensions of the paleo-lakes were recovered, and a hydrological index indicates that the effective moisture during MIS 5e and the mid-Holocene was 10.7 times and 3.6-5.0 times larger than today, respectively. Finally, the possible mechanisms behind the lake level history are discussed based on correlation with independent paleoclimatic records.

DESERTS: MODERN STUDIES INFLUENCE INTERPRETATION OF ORIGINS AND DEMISE OF ANCIENT DESERTS	HORIZONS IN EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCH, VOL 1	Horizons in Earth Science Research											Deserts are areas of barren land over which rainfall is too limited or spasmodic to support vegetation adequately, where the potential rate of evaporation can far exceed precipitation. They often exhibit both siliciclastic and, in coastal areas, carbonate eolian sands and evaporites, the latter from marine shorelines, ephemeral lakes and near-surface water tables (sabkhas). Prior to the widespread occurrence of land plants (effectively mid Devonian) eolian deposition extending back to the Phanerozoic was sporadic and difficult to substantiate as arid; deserts were probably controlled in part by their plate-tectonic location and orientation relative to prevailing subtropical winds. From the Late Permian onward, tropical deserts became more distinctive in various parts of the world but their existence was neither locally nor globally continuous. The best known modern deserts are found in the sub-tropical parts of major continents (e.g. Sahara, Arabia, Australia). Their growth and decline seems to have been controlled by the global effects of high-latitude glaciations, which squeeze alternating belts of high and low air pressure toward the equator, winds strengthen and sea levels fall. During interglacials, ice melts, wind systems become more variable with unpredictable higher rainfall, and sea level rises causing mass wasting at desert margins. The few modern temperate deserts form because of down-wind distance from a source of moisture.																					978-1-60741-221-2				2010							141	162																WOS:000278494800004

Previous numerical models of channelized subglacial flow have focused on freshwater in temperate ice without considering variable fluid chemistry and properties. Saline fluids can exist in cold glacier systems where freshwater cannot, making the routing of these fluids critical for understanding their influence on geochemical and physical processes in relevant glacial environments. This study advances previous efforts by modeling saline fluid in cold glacier systems, where variable fluid chemistry significantly influences melt rates and drainage processes. We model the drainage of a hypersaline subglacial lake through an ice-walled channel, highlighting the impact of salinity on channel evolution. The model results show that, in subglacial systems at salinity-dependent melting points, channel walls grow more slowly when fluids have higher salt concentrations, leading to significantly lower discharge rates. At higher salinities, more energy is required to warm the fluid to the new melting point as the brine is diluted, which reduces the energy available for melting the channel walls. We also highlight the impact of increased fluid density on subglacial drainage and the importance of accounting for accurate suspended sediment concentrations when modeling outburst floods. This model provides a framework to assess the impact of fluid chemistry and properties on the spatial and temporal variations of fluid flux.

Stability of Lake Sammamish phosphorus despite land use changes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Welch EB, Bouchard D, Frodge J, Jacoby JM. Stability of Lake Sammamish phosphorus despite land use changes. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in Lake Sammamish has not changed significantly following recovery in the 1970s from wastewater diversion, despite increases in developed land and impervious area of 100% and 60%, respectively, from 1980 to 2011. Annual mean, whole-lake TP has remained constant at about 18 mu g/L. Summer mean TP and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) have not changed either, and transparency increased from 3.8 m in the 1970s to consistently around 5 m since the 1980s. Reasons for the stability of annual mean TP through the 1980s were (1) hypolimnetic TP had declined by nearly 50% since the 1970s, due to 60% less internal loading; (2) water residence time increased slightly since the 1970s, allowing more settling of particulate matter; and (3) hypolimnetic TP content at turnover did not persist. In 1992, annual TP was predicted to increase from 18 to 28 mu g/L if the watershed was developed to 64% from 36% as projected, without substantial forest retention and runoff controls. Developed land increased to half the watershed, but lake TP remained unchanged. Reasons for the continued stable TP over the subsequent 2 decades are that (1) use of land for agriculture ceased; (2) runoff controls were installed; and (3) more forest was retained (64% of the watershed that supplies 70% of the lake's inflow remained 68% forested). With the implementation of runoff controls, concomitant with increased forest retention and decreased agriculture in the watershed, lake TP and water quality were more stable than originally predicted without these measures.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 3	2019	35	2					167	180		10.1080/10402381.2019.1606868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1606868		MAY 2019											WOS:000470624100001

JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												PAVLOVIC, N. B. AND S. A. LEICHT-YOUNG (U.S. Geological Survey, 1100 N. Mineral Springs Rd., Porter, IN 46304). Are temperate mature forests buffered from invasive lianas? J. Toekev Bur. Soc. 138: 85-92. 2011.-Mature and old-growth forests are often thought to be buffered against invasive species due to low levels of light and infrequent disturbance. Lianas (woody vines) and other climbing plants are also known to exhibit lower densities in older forests. As part of a larger survey of the lianas of the southern Lake Michigan region in mature and old-growth forests, the level of infestation by invasive lianas was evaluated. The only invasive liana detected in these surveys was Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. (Celastraceae). Although this species had only attached to trees and reached the canopy in a few instances, it was present in 30% of transects surveyed, mostly as a component of the ground layer. Transects with C orbiculatus had higher levels of soil potassium and higher liana richness than transects without. In contrast, transects with the native scandens had higher pH, sand content, and soil magnesium and lower organic matter compared to transects where it was absent. Celastrus orbiculatus appears to be a generalist liana since it often occurs with native lianas. Celastrus orbiculatus poses a substantial threat to mature forests as it will persist in the understory until a canopy gap or other disturbance provides the light and supports necessary for it to ascend to the canopy and damage tree species. As a result, these forests should be monitored by land managers so that C orbiculatus eradication can occur while invasions are at low densities and restricted to the ground layer.																			1095-5674	1940-0616				JAN-MAR	2011	138	1					85	92		10.3159/10-RA-055.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3159/10-RA-055.1													WOS:000290700000010

We selected four treatments (no-fertilization control (CT); combined mineral N, P and K fertilization (CF); 50% CF+50% chicken manure N (CFM); and chicken manure N (M)) to compare crop yield, N uptake, N use efficiency (NUE), and the N surplus in a Chinese cabbage-maize cropping system in a field experiment from 2011 to 2016 along a pH gradient (alkaline (pH 8.32), near-neutral (pH 6.56) and acidic soil (pH 5.91)). Chicken manure treatment was most appropriate in acidic soils because it increased pH by 2.03 units, up to 13% crop yield, and increased N uptake and NUE than that in alkaline and near-neutral soils. Under mineral fertilization, the N surplus in acidic soil was the highest. We conclude that combined organic-mineral fertilization in alkaline, near-neutral, and acidic soils is a promising strategy that not only increases the crop yield, N uptake, and NUE but also decreases the N surplus. Organic manure is especially recommended as an efficient strategy in acidic soils to increase crop yield and NUE.					wan, yu/MHR-5280-2025; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/L-7177-2017														0365-0340	1476-3567				AUG 24	2023	69	10					1893	1905		10.1080/03650340.2022.2126457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2022.2126457		SEP 2022											WOS:000864111500001

Freshwater picocyanobacteria are discriminated into either the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich or the phycocyanin (PC)-rich types according to their pigment composition. The distributions of these two types of picocyanobacteria were investigated in Barguzin Bay. The PC-rich type accounted for > 98% of the total picocyanobacteria at the station near the shore of the bay where river water flows directly in. In the offshore area of the lake, all of the picocyanobacteria cells were of the PE-rich type. In addition, the occurrence of the PC-rich type was restricted to the station, where the attenuation coefficient exceeded 0.25 m(-1). Near the shore, where the turbidity was high (> 1 NTU), the cell densities of both the PE- and PC-rich types increased away from the river mouth. This indicates that the PC-rich type cells grow near the shore of the bay where turbidity is high. Since the PC-rich type could not grow well when cells were incubated in offshore lake water, restricted distribution of the PC-rich type could also be explained by their growth capability. The present study clearly demonstrated the shift in the pigment type composition of picocyanobacteria from the coastal to the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal. The co-existence of the two pigment types probably enables the abundance of the picocyanobacterial community to be stable over a broader range of environmental conditions than would be possible for a single pigment type.

J	Takii, S; Fukui, M				Takii, S; Fukui, M			Comparison of anaerobic mineralization processes in sediments between littoral reed and offshore sites in a shallow hypertrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The rates of methanogenesis, sulfate reduction and denitrification were studied throughout a year for sediments from a littoral reed site and an offshore site in a shallow hypertrophic lake. From the comparison of annual average rates (on an area basis) of anaerobic processes between sites, methanogenesis was higher at the offshore site (23.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) than at the reed site (17.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), while denitrification and sulfate reduction were higher at the reed site (19.4 mmol N-2 m(-2) d(-1) and 2.0 mmol SO42- m(-2) d(-1)) than at the offshore site (17.2 mmol N-2 m(-2) d(-1) and 1.2 SO42- mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Of the three anaerobic processes, denitrification (53%) was most important at the reed site, while methanogenesis (50%) was most important at the offshore site on annual average. Sulfate reduction was least important in anaerobic mineralization at both sites (8.6% at the reed site and 2.7% at the offshore site). The reed site showed a higher rate of anaerobic mineralization than the offshore site in summer. These results suggest that the reed zone contributes significantly, not only to organic mineralization, but also to nutrient cycling in the lake ecosystem.

J	Hickey, CW; Gibbs, MM				Hickey, Christopher W.; Gibbs, Max M.			Lake sediment phosphorus release management-Decision support and risk assessment framework	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The release of phosphorus (P) from the sediments of eutrophic lakes is often associated with the proliferation of nuisance algal blooms, especially cyanobacteria. The successful implementation of management actions aimed at reducing such algal blooms requires an integrated approach, including both external and internal nutrient loads. The internal load of P can be a significant source of P for primary production, with greatest inputs occurring when lakes stratify and the hypolimnetic waters become anoxic. We reviewed the nature and characteristics of New Zealand lakes in relation to factors which affect the application of technologies to manage internal P loads within individual lakes. New Zealand's windy maritime climate causes lakes to mix more deeply than lakes in continental areas, which are characterised by relatively hot, calm summers. We assessed a range of management options which may be used to control internal P loads' and considered these in a decision-support framework aimed at identifying the key factors which may limit successful application. Methods to reduce P release from sediments include: physical approaches-such as artificial destratification, hypolimnetic aeration enhanced lake flushing, and dredging/discing; an geochemical approaches-such as the application of alum and iron as flocculation agents, and other products as "capping" materials. The capping materials may be either a passive physical barrier (e.g., sand, gravel, clay) or an active barrier. The active barrier systems are generally pervious chemical or geochemical materials capable of binding contaminants by adsorption or precipitation processes. A decision-support and risk assessment framework is provided to assist managers in the development of appropriate strategies for reducing or controlling internal P loads, and thus cyanobacteria blooms. A review of the sediment characteristics of lakes in the Taupo volcanic zone showed marked variability in sediment P content, and elevated geothermal arsenic concentrations in some lake sediments, which may affect the efficacy of chemical capping agents, indicating that site-specific consideration of capping agent dose is required.					; Hickey, Christopher/E-9931-2013	HICKEY, CHRISTOPHER/0000-0002-2305-1009; 													0028-8330	1175-8805				JUN	2009	43	3					819	854		10.1080/00288330909510043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330909510043													WOS:000269403900013

In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms for the -3600 cal yr B.P. climate transition that may have triggered this change in Chinese civilization based on a compilation of 33 high-resolution paleoclimate records spanning the 4000-3000 cal yr B.P. interval. Results show that North and South China experienced a meridional dipole pattern of the climate change. From 4000 to 3600 cal yr B.P., the region north of 30 degrees N was wet and the region south of 30 degrees N was dry, then from 3600 to 3000 cal yr B.P., the pattern reversed with a drier north and a wetter south. We found that this climate transition was related to the onset of a more El Nin similar to o-like state in the tropical Pacific Ocean after -3600 cal yr B.P., which resulted in more precipitation in South China but less precipitation in North China. Climate in the marginal monsoon areas of North China deteriorated, becoming more cold and arid, and pastoralism replaced cereal agriculture as the dominant mode of subsistence. Our study highlights the important role of the paleo-El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation (paleo-ENSO) for the evolution of civilization in China.

J	Innes, JB; Zong, YQ				Innes, James B.; Zong, Yongqiang			History of Mid- and Late Holocene Palaeofloods in the Yangtze Coastal Lowlands, East China: Evaluation of Non-Pollen Palynomorph Evidence, Review and Synthesis	QUATERNARY												The surface of the lowland deltaic plain around Taihu (Lake Tai), south of the Yangtze river mouth in eastern China, lies near sea level and until recent drainage and development by human societies was mostly covered by wetlands of various types. It was created by regular overbank flooding, mainly from the Yangtze, and the deposition of mostly mineral sediments over the several millennia since sea level regained its current altitude in the early mid-Holocene and progradation of the Yangtze delta began. Fluvial activity has therefore been the dominant influence on sedimentation in the Taihu lowlands, and in the lower Yangtze valley generally, and has determined the character of the mainly inorganic sediment sequences that have accumulated there, with autochthonous deposition of organic sediments within the local wetland plant communities playing a minor role. The presence of both clastic flood horizons and peat layers within the deposits of the Taihu plain attests to great variability in the magnitude of fluvial input from the Yangtze, with repeated extreme floods occurring at some periods, but with periods when the growth of peat layers shows low water tables, little exogenic sediment input and so little fluvial influence. We have examined the published evidence for these different depositional environments in the lower Yangtze and the Taihu plain during the Holocene, comparing the flood history with the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze catchment. Discrete phases of high or low flooding influence are recognised, and these correspond with large-scale Holocene climate history. Intensified human land use in recent millennia has complicated this relationship, amplifying the flooding signal. Our palynological research shows that algal microfossil type and abundance is a useful proxy for changing water depth and quality in the aquatic environments of the Holocene Taihu wetlands, and can recognise flooding events that are not registered in the floodplain lithological sequences.

J	McGee, KA; Gerlach, TM; Kessler, R; Doukas, MP				McGee, KA; Gerlach, TM; Kessler, R; Doukas, MP			Geochemical evidence for a magmatic CO2 degassing event at Mammoth Mountain, California, September-December 1997	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Recent time series soil CO2 concentration data from monitoring stations in the vicinity of Mammoth Mountain, California, reveal strong evidence for a magmatic degassing event during the fall of 1997 lasting more than 2 months. Two sensors at Horseshoe Lake first recorded the episode on September 23, 1997, followed 10 days later by a sensor on the north flank of Mammoth Mountain. Direct degassing from shallow intruding magma seems an implausible cause of the degassing event, since the gas released at Horseshoe Lake continued to be cold and barren of other magmatic gases, except for He. We suggest that an increase in compressional strain on the area south of Mammoth Mountain driven by movement of major fault blocks in Long Valley caldera may have triggered an episode of increased degassing by squeezing additional accumulated CO2 from a shallow gas reservoir to the surface along faults and other structures where it could be detected by the CO2 monitoring network. Recharge of the gas reservoir by CO2 emanating from the deep intrusions that probably triggered deep long-period earthquakes may also have contributed to the degassing event. The nature of CO2 discharge at the soilair interface is influenced by the porous character of High Sierra soils and by meteorological processes. Solar insolation is the primary source of energy for the Earth atmosphere and plays a significant role in most diurnal processes at the Earth surface. Data from this study suggest that external forcing due largely to local orographic winds influences the fine structure of the recorded CO2 signals.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				APR 10	2000	105	B4					8447	8456		10.1029/2000JB900009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JB900009													WOS:000086437500040

However, quantification of the acceleration and regional analyses remain open. Accordingly, in this study, we address the fundamental hydrological question: Is the water cycle regionally accelerating/decelerating under global warming? For our investigation, we have implemented the age-weighted regional water tagging approach into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, namely, WRF-age, to follow the atmospheric water pathways and to derive atmospheric water residence times defined as the age of tagged water since its source. We apply a three-dimensional online budget analysis of the total, tagged, and aged atmospheric water into WRF-age to provide a prognostic equation of the atmospheric water residence times and to derive atmospheric water transit times defined as the age of tagged water since its source originating from a particular physical or dynamical process. The newly developed, physics-based WRF-age model is used to regionally downscale the reanalysis of ERA-Interim and the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario exemplarily for an East Asian monsoon region, i.e., the Poyang Lake basin (the tagged water source area), for historical (1980-89) and future (2040-49) times. In the warmer (+1.9 degrees C for temperature and +2% for evaporation) and drier (-21% for precipitation) future, the residence time for the tagged water vapor will regionally decrease by 1.8 h (from 14.3 h) due to enhanced local evaporation contributions, but the transit time for the tagged precipitation will increase by 1.8 h (from 12.9 h) partly due to slower fallout of precipitating moisture components.

In the eye of the beholder: Assessing the water quality of shoreline parks around the Island of Montreal through citizen science	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a part of the FreshWater Watch project aiming to promote volunteers' water monitoring in 25 cities around the world, St. Lawrence River water quality was characterized at 28 public shoreline parks around Montreal Island, Quebec, Canada. This involved training of 69 citizen scientists by researchers of the Universite de Montreal in five one-day sessions. Shoreline sampling yielded 174 data points over three summers (May 2013 to November 2015). Water turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were measured in situ, together with the thickness and type of beach-cast vegetation, and the relative abundance of different types of beach litter. Data generated by citizen scientists provided 1) an overview of the water quality of the St. Lawrence and Des Prairies rivers around the Island of Montreal, 2) an estimation of the quantity and types of beach-cast aquatic plants and filamentous algae, and 3) novel insights into the distribution of the nuisance cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei. Overall, half of the sites were classified as "good" being characterized by low turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and little deposition of beach-cast vegetation. Lyngbya wollei was found at 57% of the sites, revealing a more frequent occurrence than initially anticipated. The amount of litter recorded along the shoreline was generally small, comprising items related to picnicking (cans/bottles), smoking, and fishing activities inmost parks. Wind exposure and rain events explained a significant fraction of the variability in nutrient concentration and turbidity among sites and dates. Shoreline condition assessed from water quality and vegetation data from this study was not correlated, however, with the most serious problem of faecal coliform counts gathered by the City of Montreal. This assessment of the quality and utilization of shoreline parks provides additional information to support planning and management activities of municipalities.

Pinatubo had a marked cooling on global climate that was evident in the regional air temperatures of the northeastern U.S. This climatic perturbation coincided with the 1991-1994 pilot surveys initiated by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program-Surface Waters (EMAP-SW). Regional air and summer profile water temperatures for 1992 were significantly lower (similar to 1-2 degrees C) than in the same July-August sampling period in 1991, 1993, or 1994. Richness of major zooplankton groups such as rotifers and small cladocerans also varied markedly with the 1992 cooling. The median of 323 randomly selected survey lakes had 2-10 additional species of zooplankton per lake in 1992 than in the warmer years of 1991, 1993, or 1994. This response represented an increase of 7-34% in local richness across lakes. Regional richness was also 17-32% higher in the cooler year. ANOVA showed that total zooplankton richness had a highly significant year effect, suggesting a response to annual climatic differences. The difference in total richness in 1992 was attributed primarily to richness of rotifers and small cladocerans. On the other hand, the richness of large cladocerans and copepods did not show significant year effects, suggesting that their responses may occur at time scales that are longer than the temporal scale of this 4-yr survey. These results indicate that local zooplankton richness can be effectively extrapolated to regional scales for the monitoring of lakes to climate change.

The depositional history of the trees illustrated two distinct peatland pine phases dated to Middle Holocene intervals 4900-4400 and 4100-3400 cal. a BC. It seems evident that both thermal and hydroclimatic fluctuations have played roles of varying importance in the establishment of this pine population and its demise. The presence of these pines, from a site similar to 60 km north of the coniferous timberline and conditions similar to 1 degrees C and 100 degree-days colder than those at the present-day timberline, concurs with previous studies demonstrating the association between the high-latitude summer-temperature cooling and circumpolar timberline retreat since the Middle Holocene due to Milankovitch forcing. On the other hand, the peatland pine recruitment was made possible by drier than present surface conditions during the previously reconstructed Middle Holocene drought anomaly (Hyvarinen-Alhonen event). Our data suggest this event was not continuous but reached its two-phase climax during the peatland pine phases, with an interruption of several centuries with moister surface conditions between 4400 and 4100 cal. a BC. The findings highlight the sensitivity of well-dated peatland tree assemblages in terms of recording past climatic evolution and events and the need for new collections from north and south Fennoscandia and the Baltic region, for more detailed analyses over extended time intervals and regions.

A multiphasic Younger Dryas cold period recorded in sediments of Lake Steisslingen, SW -Germany: A biomarker perspective	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Younger Dryas (12,680-11,590 yr BP) was the last millennial scale cold event of the Quaternary, when a mean annual temperature decline of 3-5 degrees C impacted severely on the environment. Whereas pollen distributions document changes in land vegetation, details of limnic ecosystem responses to the cooling event and to its recovery are still not well known. Here, we studied the laminated sediments of Lake Steisslingen (SW-Germany) deposited between 13,500 and 11,100 yr BP in order to investigate the evolution of an aquatic ecosystem. Bulk sediment and organic matter composition mark onset and termination of the Younger Dryas, but remain monotonous through this interval, requiring application of organic and isotope geochemical techniques to follow past ecosystem dynamics. The Younger Dryas is characterized by both an abrupt appearance and demise of longchain alkenones indicative for haptophyte algae. Based on algal and bacterial biomarker distribution, the Younger Dryas can be divided into three stages, each characterized by the dominance of a microorganism group. The first phase was dominated by nC(17) alkanes and hopanoids indicative of cyanophytes and heterotrophic bacteria. The second phase shows a proliferation of cold-adapted haptophyte algae, while in the latest phase highly-branched isoprenoids (HBI) reveal an aquatic community shift towards diatoms. Heterocyte glycolipids document a moderate change in N-2-fixing cyanobacterial community structure over the Allerod/Younger Dryas transition but show a marked collapse of the cyanobacteria association at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal climate recovery. Terrigenic wax lipids indicate significant changes in vegetation between the Allerod, Younger Dryas and Preboreal chronozones but remain homogeneous within the Younger Dryas.					; Bauersachs, Thorsten/AFY-5641-2022; Schwark, Lorenz/AAF-1902-2021	Geist, Jan/0000-0002-9042-5832; Bauersachs, Thorsten/0000-0003-4858-9443; Schwark, Lorenz/0000-0003-0683-0817													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAR 20	2020	542						121	136		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.028													WOS:000536210000011
J	Ye, HC				Ye, HC			Characteristics of winter precipitation variation over northern central eurasia and their connections to sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study reveals spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation variability and their teleconnections to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by analyzing 68 yr of recent precipitation records over the former Soviet Union. In addition to a general increasing trend of about 0.4 mm yr(-1) or 6% decade(-1) over much of the study region, three major modes of precipitation variation are identified. A quasibiennial variation of 2-3 yr is found over the region surrounding the Caspian and Aral Seas. An El Nino timescale precipitation variation of 4-5 yr is present over southern central Siberia and is associated with eastern tropical Pacific SSTs. A quasi-decadal timescale variation of about 11-12 yr is evident over central European Russia. This quasi-decadal precipitation variation is closely linked to a major SST anomaly pattern of alternating latitudinal belts over the Atlantic and SST variations over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These associations to SSTs are stronger at the timescales identified in this study than at an interannual timescale. The atmospheric west Atlantic pattern and atmospheric anomalies over the eastern tropical Pacific bridge the teleconnection between precipitation over central European Russia and both oceans at quasi-decadal timescales. The atmospheric anomalies over the eastern Pacific coupled with eastern tropical SST anomalies are teleconnected to those over northern Asia and, thus, are responsible for the precipitation variation over southern central Siberia at an El Nino timescale.

Yearling Muskellunge Poststocking Behavior and Survival in Two Central Iowa Reservoirs with Contrasting Habitat Availability	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												MuskellungeEsox masquinongyis a prized sport fish throughout much of North America. Due to the species' popularity among anglers and limited natural recruitment in reservoirs, Muskellunge are commonly stocked to maintain populations. However, little is known about their poststocking behavior and survival in reservoirs. We used radiotelemetry to evaluate behavior and survival of spring-stocked yearling Muskellunge in two Iowa reservoirs that differed in habitat availability (Big Creek Lake: limited habitat; Brushy Creek Lake: abundant habitat). Hatchery-reared Muskellunge were implanted with radio transmitters (n = 15-16 fish center dot lake(-1)center dot year(-1); 61 fish total) and stocked in both lakes during May 2017 and 2018; fish were tracked daily for 1 week, every other day for the second week, and then weekly until December. Telemetry data were used to evaluate depth and vegetation use, selection of littoral substrate and coarse woody habitat (CWH) complexities, movement, home ranges, and survival. Muskellunge depth use generally increased with time poststocking and was greater in Brushy Creek Lake than in Big Creek Lake. Movement rates were greatest during the first week poststocking and declined thereafter, with greater rates and home ranges in Big Creek Lake. Muskellunge in both systems selected for fine substrates while avoiding coarse substrates. Muskellunge in Brushy Creek Lake were more commonly associated with CWH and aquatic vegetation compared to those in Big Creek Lake. Muskellunge in Big Creek Lake selected for complex CWH, while those in Brushy Creek Lake used CWH classes in proportion to their availability. Cormack-Jolly-Seber daily apparent survival estimates were lowest for the first 4 d poststocking and ranged from 0.59 to 0.99, after which survival increased from May to September before declining in October and November. Results of this study provide a greater understanding of the poststocking success of yearling Muskellunge and suggest that Muskellunge behavior and survival are dependent on habitat complexity, with weaker habitat selection but higher survival in complex systems.

Effects of Diel Temperature Fluctuation on Growth, Stress Response, and Immune Function of Burbot	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												North American Burbot Lota lota maculosa occupy habitats from deep, cold lakes to prairie streams. Controlled laboratory trials were conducted to evaluate the growth, immune response, and thermal stress physiology of juvenile Burbot subjected to fluctuating, high diel temperatures. Age-0 Burbot from a captive propagation program associated with population restoration in the Kootenai River, Idaho, were tested in temperature cycles that imitated summer conditions observed in regional stream habitats. The diel temperature cycle for the treatment group varied from 18 degrees C at night to 27 degrees C during the day, whereas the control group was held at a constant temperature of 14 degrees C. We evaluated survival, growth, feed efficiency, heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) levels, hsp70 gene expression, serum lysozyme levels, and proximate body composition in samples taken from fish before, during, and at the completion of the trials. Both treatments had high survival and similar growth rates, but the control group gained significantly more weight and had better feed conversion rates than the treatment group. Mean hsp70 expression and hsp70 abundance were significantly higher in the treatment group but varied between sampling events and between tissue types. Expression of hsp70 in treatment fish was highest on day 15 for muscle tissue (251 times the control value) and on day 30 for liver tissue (1,131 times the control value), with variable abundance of hsp70 at both sampling points. Serum lysozyme levels were not different between treatments. An additional short-term trial was conducted to evaluate the response of Burbot to upper lethal temperatures, with daily maxima approaching 32 degrees C. Despite being commonly referred to as a coldwater stenotherm, the Burbot displayed resilience to thermal stress, and were able to withstand temperatures exceeding 31 degrees C.					; Adams, Jennifer/H-1780-2011; CAIN, KEN/ABC-2818-2020	Cain, Kenneth/0000-0002-9488-0461; Terrazas, Marc/0000-0003-2675-1833; 													0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	5					996	1007		10.1080/00028487.2017.1334701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1334701													WOS:000408773500014

Griseb.) is an invasive species indigenous to South America. With its rapid invasion of southeastern US waterways, understanding the invasiveness of this plant species is critical for providing possible mechanisms of prevention for resource managers. The aim of this project is to use a matrix model to study the invasion dynamics of alligatorweed under both terrestrial and aquatic environments. The use of this model allows for a deeper understanding of the invasiveness and life historystage structure of alligatorweed. In particular, matrix analysis can further test the hypothesis that certain life stages of alligatorweed might be more sensitive to control and management. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the spread of alligatorweed under both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Utilizing the growth data obtained during the summer of 2010, matrix analysis was used to model the growth of alligatorweed for six different treatments. Transition matrices were generated based on plant measurements taken at different life stages defined by the number of leaves or nodes. These matrices are population projection models whose eigenvalues represent the growth rate of alligatorweed. A high growth rate is a key feature of successful invaders. Residuals were calculated and sensitivity analysis was performed to test the accuracy of the model and importance of each life stage over the entire life cycle of alligatorweed. The results of this study indicate that in the aquatic habitat, plants at their early life cycle stage are most sensitive to potential control measures. Conversely, in the terrestrial habitat, the most sensitive stage of alligatorweed is at its late life cycle stage, characterized with large-sized plants, thus suggesting the best timing for management and eradication of this invasive species.					; Huckaba, Aron/I-9915-2018; Erwin, Samantha/AAK-8865-2021	Huckaba, Aron/0000-0001-6100-7263; Erwin, Samantha/0000-0002-5162-4193													1752-9921	1752-993X				APR	2013	6	2					150	157		10.1093/jpe/rts024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rts024													WOS:000316964200005

The thermal behaviour of the reservoir was warm, monomictic (Nov-Feb), and water levels fell to 12 m below capacity. Observed hypolimnetic temperature increases in VB are considered indirect evidence of boundary mixing events, previously attributed to internal waves driven by strong diurnal winds along a 7 km fetch. Unusually low biomasses were observed during circulation, probably due to low light availability (Z(eu)/Z(mix) < 1), grazing, and relatively low temperatures (<20 degrees C). In contrast, enhanced phytoplankton biomass was observed throughout stratification, which could be explained by nutrient inputs to the epilimnion through boundary mixing, as previously proposed for VB, and by higher (>20 degrees C) temperatures. Dominant species were Cyclotella ocellata, Fragilaria crotonensis, Woronichinia naegeliana, and Microcystis wesenbergii. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Nostocales), a recurrent problem in this reservoir, were markedly less abundant than during high-water periods (2002-2005), probably due to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) inputs from the hypolimnion. A profuse formation of heterocysts was observed at the same time that DIN and the DIN to soluble reactive phosphorus ratio (DIN:SRP) were low (<2 mu mol L-1 and similar to 1 respectively), suggesting heterocyst development could be a complementary proxy to assess DIN limitation. Intense water level decreases in this reservoir resulted in increasing biomasses of planktonic diatoms and a significant decrease in noxious algae such as Nostocales, thus ameliorating the water quality of the reservoir.					; Merino-Ibarra, Martín/KPY-5742-2024; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/KPY-5742-2024	Castillo Sandoval, Fermin Sergio/0000-0002-5934-8859; Vilaclara, Gloria/0000-0003-4923-891X; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101													2044-2041	2044-205X					2014	4	3					337	348		10.5268/IW-4.3.598	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-4.3.598													WOS:000344015000010

The 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed affiliation to the Roseobacter clade (class Alphaproteobacteria) with Sulfitobacter marinus SW-265(T) as the most closely related characterized strain, showing 97.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Calculation of phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated, however, that members of the genus Roseobacter, Roseobacter denitrificans Och 114(T) and Roseobacter litoralis Och 149(T) (95 % and 96% sequence similarity, respectively) fall between strain 5H4-1(T) and the Sulfitobacter cluster including Oceanibulbus indolifeg HEL-45(T) (>= 95.4 % sequence similarity). Cells of strain SH4-1(T) are irregular rods with at least one flagellum. Optimal growth occurred between 28 and 32 degrees C and at a pH between 7.0 and 8.5. Cells require the vitamin nicotinic acid amide as well as sodium ions for growth. The DNA G+C content was 55.1 mol%. The fatty acids (>1 %) comprised C-10:0, 3-OH, C-12:1, C-14:1 3-OH, C-18:0, C-16.0, C-18:0,C- C-18:2, C-18:1 omega 7c and 11-methyl C-18:1 omega 7c. The polar lipid pattern indicated the presence of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, an unidentified aminolipid, one unidentified phospholipid and one other unidentified lipid. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic differences, strain SH4-1(T) represents a novel species in a new genus within the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which we propose the name Pelagimonas varians gen. nov., sp. nov.

Geo-chemical Behavior of Uranium in the Sambhar Salt Lake, Rajasthan (India): Implications to "Source" of Salt and Uranium "Sink"	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Among several salt lakes in the Thar Desert of western India, the Sambhar is the largest lake producing about 2 x 10(5) tons of salt (NaCl) annually. The "lake system" (lake waters, inflowing river waters, and sub-surface brines) provides a unique setting to study the geo-chemical behavior of uranium isotopes (U-238, U-234) in conjunction with the evolution of brines over the annual wetting and evaporation cycles. The concentration of U-238 and the total dissolved solids (TDS) in lake water increase from similar to 8 mu g L-1 and similar to 8 g L-1 in monsoon to similar to 1,400 mu g L-1 and 370 g L-1, respectively, during summer time. The U/TDS ratio (similar to 1 mu g g(-1) salt) and the U-234/U-238 activity ratio (1.65 +/- A 0.05), however, remain almost unchanged throughout the year, except when U/TDS ratio approaches to 3.8 at/or beyond halite crystallization. These observations suggest that uranium behaves conservatively in the lake waters during the annual cycle of evaporation. Also, uranium and salt content (TDS) are intimately coupled, which has been used to infer the origin and source of salt in the lake basin. Furthermore, near uniform ratios in evaporating lake waters, when compared to the ratio in seawater (similar to 0.1 mu g g(-1) salt and 1.14 +/- A 0.02, respectively), imply that aeolian transport of marine salts is unlikely to be significant source of salt to the lake in the present-day hydrologic conditions. This inference is further consistent with the chemical composition of wet-precipitation occurring in and around the Sambhar lake. The seasonal streams feeding the lake and groundwaters (within the lake's periphery) have distinctly different ratios of U/TDS (2-69 mu g g(-1) salt) and U-234/U-238 (1.15-2.26) compared to those in the lake. The average U/TDS ratio of similar to 1 mu g g(-1) salt in lake waters and similar to 19 mu g g(-1) salt in river waters suggest dilution of the uranium content by the recycled salt and/or removal processes presently operating in the lake during the extraction of salt for commercial use. Based on mass-balance calculations, a conservative estimate of "uranium sink" (in the form of bittern crust) accounts for similar to 5 tons year(-1) from the lake basin, an estimate similar to its input flux from rivers, i.e., 4.4 tons year(-1).																			1380-6165	1573-1421				DEC	2009	15	4					529	545		10.1007/s10498-009-9066-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-009-9066-3													WOS:000271720200004

Los, H		Mathematical modelling as a tool for management in eutrophication control of shallow lakes	ECO-HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN COASTAL WATERS AND LAKES USING BLOOM	Deltares Select Series											The eutrophication model DELWAQ-BLOOM-SWITCH is developed to be a functional tool for water management. Therefore it includes nutrients, algal biomass and composition as well as water transparency. A module describing the interaction between water and bottom gives the model the flexibility to deal with measures, such as a decrease of the external phosphorus loading and flushing with water differing in composition from the lake water. This paper focuses on the functional aspects of the model, the results of an application on Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands, and the implications for water management. With one set of coefficients DBS reproduces the most important characteristics of Lake Veluwe for a period of two years before measures (reduction of the external loading and flushing during the winter months) and eight years after the measures. The phosphorous concentration decreased and became growth limiting for algae instead of nitrogen and light. Both in measurements and modelling results, the algal composition changed from blue-green algae dominance to green algae and diatom dominance. Lake Veluwe had a relatively short transient phase after reduction of external loading, because high nitrate concentrations in the flushing water inhibited a long period with high phosphorus releases from the bottom. Model calculations were carried out to investigate the effects of fish stock management and optimization of flushing. Both measures are promising.																			1877-5608		978-1-58603-987-5				2009	1						97	110																WOS:000271712500005
J	Kayuni, S; Peeling, R; Makaula, P				Kayuni, Sekeleghe; Peeling, Rosanna; Makaula, Peter			Prevalence and distribution of Schistosoma haematobium infection among school children living in southwestern shores of Lake Malawi	MALAWI MEDICAL JOURNAL												Background The prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection has been shown to be about 23.7% among children living in the lakeshore areas of Malawi, with reinfection rates of about 30% to 40%. This study aimed to determine the current prevalence and distribution of S. haematobium infection in school children along the southwestern shores of Lake Malawi and examine the control interventions present in the area. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in primary schools. School children were enrolled, demographic data were collected, and urine samples were submitted for analysis on macrohaematuria, microhaematuria, and S. haematobium eggs. A questionnaire was administered to 3 health facilities on diagnosis and treatment of schistosomiasis, as well as the control interventions against it. Results Four hundred children (174 males and 226 females) were enrolled from 7 primary schools. Mean participant age was 9.57 years (range 7 to 12 years). Fifty children (12.5%) had S. haematobium eggs detected in their urine, with the mean egg count being 15/10 mL. The highest infection intensity category (>= 50 eggs/10mL) was seen in 10 children (2.5%). Prevalence varied significantly between the schools, with rates ranging from 0% to 20%. Schools with higher prevalence rates were located farther away from the nearest public hospital that provides treatment free of charge. Prevalence correlated with previous history of mass chemotherapy in schools. Mass chemotherapy, health education, and improved water supply and sanitation were some of the interventions that contributed to lower prevalence rates in some areas. Conclusions Schistosomiasis prevalence around southwestern Lake Malawi was lower than previously reported, owing to control interventions focusing on health education, improved water supply, sanitation, and mass chemotherapy. Consistent and uniform interventions can reduce prevalence further and sustain control. As prevalence falls, diagnostics can identify high transmission areas, monitor disease trends, and guide evidence-based control strategies.

Glaciovolcanic hydrothermal environments in Iceland and implications for their detection on Mars	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Volcanism has been a dominant process on Mars, along with a pervasive global cryosphere. Therefore, the interaction between these two is considered likely. Terrestrial glaciovolcanism produces distinctive lithologies and alteration terrains, as well as hydrothermal environments that can be inhabited by microorganisms. Here, we provide a framework for identifying evidence of such glaciovolcanic environments during future Mars exploration, and provide a descriptive reference for active hydrothermal environments to be utilised for future astrobiological studies. Remote sensing data were combined with field observations and sample analysis that included X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thin section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectrometer analysis, and dissolved water chemistry to characterise samples from two areas of basaltic glaciovolcanism: Askja and Kverkfjoll volcanoes in Iceland. The glaciovolcanic terrain between these volcanoes is characterised by subglacially-erupted fissure swarm ridges, which have since been modified by multiple glacial outburst floods. Active hydrothermal environments at Kverkfjoll include hot springs, anoxic pools, glacial meltwater lakes, and sulphur- and iron-depositing fumaroles, all situated within ice-bound geothermal fields. Temperatures range from 0 degrees C-94.4 degrees C, and aqueous environments are acidic-neutral (pH 2-7.5) and sulphate-dominated. Mineralogy of sediments, mineral crusts, and secondary deposits within basalts suggest two types of hydrothermal alteration: a low-temperature (<120 degrees C) assemblage dominated by nanophase palagonite, sulphates (gypsum, jarosite), and iron oxides (goethite, hematite); and a high-temperature (>120 degrees C) assemblage signified by zeolite (heulandite) and quartz. These mineral assemblages are consistent with those identified at the Martian surface. In-situ and laboratory VNIR (440-1000 nm) reflectance spectra representative of Mars rover multispectral imaging show sediment spectral profiles to be influenced by Fe2+/3+-bearing minerals, regardless of their dominant bulk mineralogy. Characterising these terrestrial glaciovolcanic deposits can help identify similar processes on Mars, as well as identifying palaeoenvironments that may once have supported and preserved life.

POST-DAMMING FLOW REGIME DEVELOPMENT IN A LARGE LOWLAND RIVER (VOLGA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION): IMPLICATIONS FOR FLOODPLAIN INUNDATION AND FISHERIES	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Periodic flooding plays a key role in the ecology of floodplain rivers. Damming of such rivers can disturb flooding patterns and have a negative impact on commercial fish yield. The Volga River, the largest river in Europe, has a regulated flow regime after completion of a cascade of dams. Here, we study effects of damming on long-term discharge variability and flood pulse characteristics. In addition, we evaluate the effects of the altered flood pulse on floodplain ecosystem functioning and commercial fish yields. Our results indicate that both flood pulse and fish populations of the VolgaAkhtuba floodplain have varied considerably over the past decades. After damming, annual maximum peak discharges have decreased, minimum discharges increased, but average discharges remained similar to pre-damming conditions. Moreover, because of bed level incision of over 1.5 m, a higher discharge is needed to reach bankfull level and inundate the floodplains. Despite this significantly altered hydrological regime and subsequent morphological changes, current discharge management still provides significant spring flooding. However, commercial fish catches did decrease after damming, both in the main channel and in the floodplain lakes. All catches were dominated by species with a eurytopic flow preference, although catches from the main channel contained more rheophilic species, and floodplain catches contained more limnophilic and phytophilic species. The strong increase of opportunistic gibel carp (Carassius gibelio) around 1985 was apparent in the main channel and the floodplain lakes. Despite the hydrological changes, the decrease in overall catches, and the upsurge of gibel, we found a strong positive effect of flood magnitude in the previous year on commercial fish yield in the floodplain lakes. This suggests that under the current discharge management there still is an increased fish growth and/or survival during high floods and that functioning of the floodplain is at least partly intact.

Mapping migratory flyways in Asia using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Identifying movement routes and stopover sites is necessary for developing effective management and conservation strategies for migratory animals. In the case of migratory birds, a collection of migration routes, known as a flyway, is often hundreds to thousands of kilometers long and can extend across political boundaries. Flyways encompass the entire geographic range between the breeding and non-breeding areas of a population, species, or a group of species, and they provide spatial frameworks for management and conservation across international borders. Existing flyway maps are largely qualitative accounts based on band returns and survey data rather than observed movement routes. In this study, we use satellite and GPS telemetry data and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to build upon existing maps and describe waterfowl space use probabilistically in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. Results: Our approach provided new information on migratory routes that was not easily attainable with existing methods to describe flyways. Utilization distributions from dynamic Brownian bridge movement models identified key staging and stopover sites, migration corridors and general flyway outlines in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. A map of space use from ruddy shelducks depicted two separate movement corridors within the Central Asian Flyway, likely representing two distinct populations that show relatively strong connectivity between breeding and wintering areas. Bar-headed geese marked at seven locations in the Central Asian Flyway showed heaviest use at several stopover sites in the same general region of high-elevation lakes along the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our analysis of data from multiple Anatidae species marked at sites throughout Asia highlighted major movement corridors across species and confirmed that the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways were spatially distinct. Conclusions: The dynamic Brownian bridge movement model improves our understanding of flyways by estimating relative use of regions in the flyway while providing detailed, quantitative information on migration timing and population connectivity including uncertainty between locations. This model effectively quantifies the relative importance of different migration corridors and stopover sites and may help prioritize specific areas in flyways for conservation of waterbird populations.					; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Xiao, Xiangming/ABS-9360-2022; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-3761-2019	Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428; Palm, Eric/0000-0002-5330-4804; Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; 													2051-3933						2015	3								3	10.1186/s40462-015-0029-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-015-0029-6								25709838					WOS:000215741800003

Oligotrophic Lake Waikaremoana, New Zealand, is used for hydroelectric power generation and the lake levels are manipulated within an operating range of 3 m. There was concern that rapidly changing water levels adversely affected the littoral zone by decreasing light availability in two ways: local turbidity caused by shoreline erosion at low water levels; and decreased light penetration to the deep littoral zone caused by high water levels in summer. 2. The Littoral zone was dominated by native aquatic plants with vascular species to 6 m and a characean meadow below this to 16 m. The biomass and heights of the communities in the depth zone 0-6 m were reduced at a site exposed to wave action relative to those at a sheltered site. However, the community structure below 6 m was similar at exposed and sheltered sites. The lower boundary of the littoral zone was sharply delimited at 16 m and this bottom boundary remained constant throughout the year despite large seasonal changes in solar radiation and the 3 m variation in lake level. 3. There was evidence that the deep-water community consisting of Chara corallina had adapted physiologically to low-light conditions. Net light saturated photosynthesis (CO2 exchange) per unit chlorophyll a (Chl a) was reduced to 1.7 mu g C (mu g Chl a)(-1) h(-1) at the lower boundary, half of that recorded at 5 m. The concentration of Chl a per gram of biomass (dry weight), was considerably greater at the lower boundary than higher in the profile [c. 7 mg Chl a (g dry wt)(-1) at 16 m vs. 4 mg Chl a (g dry wt)(-1) at 5 m]. Chl b also increased with depth and there was no change in the ratio of Chl a and Chl b with increasing depth. The saturation light intensity (I-k) of the community at the lower boundary was only 78 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). photosynthetic parameters (I-k and alpha) as well as the Chl a content remained relatively constant throughout the seasonal and short-term changes in radiation. 4. The photosynthetic characteristics of the littoral community were therefore not greatly affected by the lake level change caused by the present hydroelectric operations. However, the sharpness of the lower boundary and its extreme shade characteristics imply that the deep-water community would be sensitive to any further changes in underwater light availability.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Howard-Williams, Clive/0000-0002-8323-6806													0046-5070					FEB	1995	33	1					91	102		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00389.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00389.x													WOS:A1995QH47800009
J	Gilbert, R; Desloges, JR				Gilbert, R; Desloges, JR			The record of Glacial Lake Champagne in Kusawa Lake, southwestern Yukon Territory	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Late Pleistocene glaciers dammed Glacial Lake Champagne in the valley of Dezadeash River between a westward-flowing glacier in the Takhini valley and eastward-flowing glaciers from the St. Elias complex. Modern Kusawa Lake lies in the Southern extension of Lake Champagne. Geophysical and geomorphic evidence documents the deglaciation of the lake, the presence of Lake Champagne, and the postglacial sedimentary environment of the basin. During the main phase of Lake Champagne, the water level stood at 772 m in the northern part of Kusawa Lake and 756 in in northern Dezadeash valley, both probably controlled by a spillway floored at 756 in to the north into the Nordenskiold River. This indicates differential isostatic rebound of 0.2 m/km from south to north. At that time a trunk glacier occupied the southern portion of Kusawa Lake, depositing it thick sequence of sediment in the basin. A glacier in the Primrose valley and the Takhini trunk glacier built large deltas into Lake Champagne. Subsequently, the level fell to 744 in, controlled by I spillway around the sediment plug at the outlet of Kusawa Lake, and the trunk glacier retreated from Kusawa Lake. Lacustrine sediment washed from the now substantially exposed valley sides was deposited as a distinctive facies in the north-central portion of Kusawa Lake. Incision of the delta at the outlet of the lake lowered its level to a major strandline at 714 in and eventually to its present level of 671 in. In the Southern portion of the lake, a single sedimentary facies documents Continuous glacilacustrine deposition from sediment originating in tributary basins still containing 11%-14% glacier cover.																			0008-4077					DEC	2005	42	12					2127	2140		10.1139/E05-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E05-094													WOS:000237356900007
J	Lachniet, MS; Asmerom, Y; Polyak, V				Lachniet, Matthew S.; Asmerom, Yemane; Polyak, Victor			Deglacial paleoclimate in the southwestern United States: an abrupt 18.6 ka cold event and evidence for a North Atlantic forcing of Termination I	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a new U-series dated speleothem record (PC-1) from the Great Basin that documents deglacial climate variability between ca 20.1 and 15.6 ka. Our data show an abrupt 18.6 ka cold event preceding Heinrich event 1 that is consistent with expansion of the Laurentide Ice sheet during the 'binge' phase of ice growth. This event coincided with dessication of pluvial Lake Mojave suggesting cold and dry conditions in the southern Great Basin at this time. PC-1 delta O-18 values before and during Heinrich event 1 are similar, but an increase in stalagmite growth rates suggests wetter conditions that coincided with deposition of spring deposits in southern Nevada. The time interval of our record is consistent with the timing of pluvial conditions in the Great Basin as evident from a comparison to regional wetness proxies. Our new speleothem record, recovered from the recharge area for Devils Hole, does not show a delta O-18 increase coincident with the abrupt increase in Devils Hole delta O-18 at c. 18 ka, challenging the view that the Great Basin experienced an early Termination I. This hypothesis is supported by two other southwest speleothem records that demonstrate deglaciation was synchronous with forcing from the North Atlantic Ocean. We suggest that Devils Hole speleothem delta O-18 values may partly reflect source water changes in the regional aquifer. Further, Devils Hole delta C-13 minima coincide with peak global glacial conditions and weak Asian monsoon periods, suggesting that they constrain better the timing of pluvial conditions in the Great Basin.

J	James, GD; Graynoth, E				James, Gavin D.; Graynoth, Eric			Influence of fluctuating lake levels and water clarity on trout populations in littoral zones of New Zealand alpine lakes	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus 1758) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Richardson 1836) populations in littoral zones of eight South Island, New Zealand alpine lakes were compared using gill and seine net sampling during summer. Lakes were selected to provide a matrix of lake level and water clarity variations and to assess how these variables influenced trout abundance (as reflected by catch rate), depth distribution, and size. Brown trout were small and in poor condition in three turbid lakes with shallow littoral zones and were scarce in one of these with a 14 m fluctuation. Although brown trout condition was generally higher in clear lakes, Lake Wanaka fish were an exception. Trout depth distribution was positively related to depth of the littoral zone. Brown trout were caught at most depths whereas rainbow trout showed variable depth preferences in different lakes. Rainbow trout catch rate, weight, and condition factor were unrelated to differences in depth of the littoral zone or lake level fluctuations, and it was concluded that spawning success and limnetic food supplies may be more important for this species. Spawning interactions may account for the different species composition between the stable clear Lake Wanaka, and the adjacent fluctuating clear Lake Hawea. Moderate and slow lake level fluctuations appear to have limited effects on trout in clear lakes, probably because trout are able to use deep littoral habitat and food supplies.																			0028-8330					MAR	2002	36	1					39	52		10.1080/00288330.2002.9517069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2002.9517069													WOS:000207835600004

An increase in the mean annual air temperature of 0.06 degrees C/year and in the annual precipitation amount of 10 mm/year is observed. The good correlation of the tritium activity concentration in the PL and Zagreb precipitation implies that the tritium data for Zagreb are applicable for the study of the PL area. The best local meteoric water line at PL was obtained by the reduced major axis regression (RMA) and precipitation-weighted ordinary least squares regression (PWLSR) approaches: delta H-2(PWLSR)= (7.97 +/- 0.12) delta O-18 + (13.8 +/- 1.3). The higher deuterium excess at PL (14.0 +/- 2.2 parts per thousand) than that at Zagreb reflects the higher altitude and influence of the Mediterranean precipitation. The delta H-2 in precipitation ranges from -132.4 parts per thousand to -22.3 parts per thousand and delta O-18 from -18.3 parts per thousand to -4.1 parts per thousand. The much narrower ranges in the groundwater (delta O-18, delta H-2) indicate the good mixing of waters in aquifers and short mean residence times. The higher average delta H-2 in all three karst springs observed after 2003 can be attributed to the increase in the mean air temperature. The mean delta H-2 and delta O-18 values in the surface and lake water increase downstream due to the evaporation of surface waters. There is no significant difference between the surface water line and the lake water line (2011-2014). The stable isotope composition of the surface and lake waters reacts to extreme hydrological conditions.

Results were compared with regional pollution forcings, including fertiliser application, atmospheric nitrate and dust deposition, and a localised multiscale air quality modelling system for N-deposition. Our data reflect a mesotrophic lake for the majority of the 20(th) Century with minimal anthropogenic impact. A shift in the lake conditions is evident after 1985 with increased nutrient enrichment. Low delta N-15, OC:TN and increasing TN values, together with an increase in chironomid taxa associated with eutrophic conditions and macrophytes are exhibited in the record, particularly since 2002. These changes are consistent with nutrient loading causing a change in trophic status. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial RDAs verified TN as an important driver behind the shift in chironomid community composition in recent decades, explaining 22.2% of the variance on its own and 16.9% with other environmental variables partialled out. While temperature change since 1960 was not a primary control on the chironomid community of Lake Bander, a step-change increase in summer temperatures since the 1990s coincided with the disappearance of cold stenotherms from the record and seems to have exacerbated the shift to more productive conditions. This study highlights the reach of airborne N from modern agricultural and industrial activity to remote locations, and demonstrates the utility of palaeolimnological techniques as part of modern ecosystem assessment for conservation.					; Taylor, Karen/LTC-8121-2024	Tang, Ya/0000-0001-7552-4181; Taylor, Karen/0000-0003-4376-8610; Potito, Aaron/0000-0003-0194-9552; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2023	69	2					141	160		10.1007/s10933-022-00266-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-022-00266-5		SEP 2022											WOS:000849479300001

Migration patterns and spatial connectivity of Pallas's Gulls (Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus) from Alakol lake, Kazakhstan using ring recovery and tracking data	AVIAN RESEARCH												Understanding migration patterns and spatial connectivity is crucial for conserving long-distance migratory birds. While satellite telemetry has advanced the study of large gulls, Pallas's Gull (Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus) remains relatively understudied, with limited data on its migration routes and habitat use, particularly in Central Asia. This study integrates 684 ring recoveries (1968-2024) and GPS tracking data to analyze the migration ecology of individuals breeding at Alakol Lake, Kazakhstan. Ring recoveries confirm migratory connectivity across Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Pakistan, with wintering records as far as India, Kuwait, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia. GPS tracking of a single individual (June 2020-August 2021) revealed a migration route from Alakol Lake to the Arabian Sea, with key stopovers at Zaisan Lake, Balkhash Lake, the Aral Sea, Aydar Lake, and the Amu Darya River. Notably, a post-breeding northward dispersal to Zaisan Lake and southern Russia was identified before the southward migration commenced. These findings highlight the significance of Kazakhstan's lakes as breeding and migratory hubs and the need to protect critical stopover sites in Central Asia. Given increasing anthropogenic pressures on wetland habitats, this research provides essential baseline data for conservation planning and enhances the broader understanding of gull migration ecology.

Thus, its abundance of floodplain lakes (FPL) in that part constitutes an area which preserves biodiversity. This study presents an analysis of potamophases duration and the Potamophases Concentration Index (PCI) in 20 floodplain lakes in the multi-year period 1952-2014. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, Tukey test), as well as a correlogram approach were used to perform statistical analyses. Among the lakes, few differed significantly from the others; more often, differences between years, in terms of both potamophase duration and PCI, were found. This proved that time is more important than space in shaping river valley hydrology. Cumulative values of the study indices, presented in a correlogram, showed that both potamophase duration and the period of potamophase concentration determine the water quality of a floodplain lake, expressed as the hydro-chemical type. In floodplain lakes with short potamophases concentrated at the beginning of a hydrologic year, water quality typical for interzonallakes was observed; in floodplain lakes with the longest potamophases with their concentration at the end of a hydrologic year, ionic concentrations typical of extrazonal lakes occurred, whereas in lakes with a potamophase duration close to the average value and a spring concentration of floods, intermediate water quality was observed, typical of mixozonal lakes. A sound knowledge of floodplain lake functioning is crucial to maintaining the biodiversity of river valleys due to the lake's natural water and nutrient storage capacity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

High sodium dominance in river or lake water indicates low weathering rate. Here, this concept is evaluated using intensive temporal and spatial sampling strategies in two substantial catchments, one in Scotland and the other in central England, with particular reference to detection of groundwater inputs, and to possible problems from road salting in the calibration. In the Dee network, the spatial distribution of sodium dominance reflects the distribution of soil parent material geology, but land use also influences the equations. It is postulated that road density, via winter road salting, influences the sodium dominance calibration in lowland agricultural areas. Although road salting can also be problematic in some upland areas, the index still can provide clear indication of the likely severity of acid flush events in remote upland streams. In the Etherow catchment, sodium dominance varies markedly, sometimes over relatively small distances, reflecting Soil type distribution, the occurrence of ground-water inputs to streams, and the influence of water in tributaries above the sampling point.

The results of previous studies indicating bactericidal action were questioned because of inadequate culturing methods. In this study, the membrane filter technique was used to determine survival of Escherichia coli in Great Salt Lake water. Two water samples were seeded with 1 ml of a 1: 1000 dilution of a broth culture of 5 strains of recently isolated E. coli. A like dilution was made in 1 liter of normal saline to serve as a control. Samples were filtered through sterile membrane filters and were incubated on media pads saturated with EHC Albimi peptone M broth at 37[degree]C in a moist incubator. After 2 hours on enriched substrate the membranes were transferred to pads containing EHC double-strength Endo''s broth and reincubated. It was found that E. coli was not killed rapidly by water from Great Salt Lake. At summer temperature few bacteria survived more than 8 hours, but at 6[degree]C approximately 50% survived 24-hour exposure to the lake water. The membrane filter technique was found to be valuable in testing survival of bacteria in an unfavorable environment, and was an excellent means for transferring organisms from an unfavorable environment to one that was favorable.																			0096-364X						1954	26	9					1141	1144																WOS:A1954XS03700012

Data were collected by the airborne platform Helipod during the STINHO 2002 and LITFASS 2003 campaigns in eastern Germany, during early summer months, when the lake was much colder than the surrounding surface. The objective was to assess which atmospheric parameters show influence from the lake by the airborne observations. While spatial variability for mean quantities is not significant at the observation height of 70m and above, the second-order statistics related to potential temperature exhibit a clear decrease in the vicinity of the lake for measurements taken below 100m above ground level. Second-order statistics of humidity and vertical wind velocity are not suited to identify the foot print of the lake in our study. Several length scales of surface heterogeneity were calculated following previous studies. Only the scale that considers vertical velocity is compatible with our airborne observations. In addition, the application of a convective scale indicates that the lake could affect the lower convective boundary layer above the lake and above the surrounding land downstream of the flow for low wind speeds (below 4 m s(-1)). Finally, the downstream propagation of the lake influence has been addressed by calculating the cross-correlation function between the surface radiative temperature and the variance of potential temperature. A clear relationship between the spatial lag of the maximum correlation and the horizontal advectivon could be identified.

J	Schubert, SD; Helfand, HM; Wu, CY; Min, W				Schubert, SD; Helfand, HM; Wu, CY; Min, W			Subseasonal variations in warm-season moisture transport and precipitation over the central and eastern United States	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Subseasonal variations in warm-season (May-August) precipitation over the central and eastern1 United States are shown to be strongly linked to variations in the moisture entering the continent from the Gulf of Mexico within a longitudinally confined "channel" (referred to here as the Texas corridor or TC). These variations reflect the development of low-level southerly wind maxima (or jets) on a number of different timescales in association with distinct subcontinental and larger-scale phenomena. On the diurnal timescale, the TC moisture flux variations are tied to the development of the Great Plains low-level jet. The composite nighttime anomalies are characterized by a strong southerly moisture flux covering northeast Mexico and the southern Great Plains, and enhanced boundary layer convergence and precipitation over much of the upper Great Plains. The strongest jets tend to be associated with an anomalous surface low over the Great Plains, reflecting a predilection for periods when midlatitude weather systems are positioned to produce enhanced southerly how over this region. On subsynoptic (2-4 days) timescales the TC moisture flux variations are associated with the development and evolution of a warm-season lee cyclone. These systems, which are most prevalent during the early part of the warm season (May and June), form over the central Great Plains in association with an upper-level shortwave and enhanced upper-tropospheric cross-mountain westerly flow. A low-level southerly wind maximum or jet develops underneath and perpendicular to the advancing edge of enhanced midtropospheric westerlies. The clash of anomalous southerly moisture Aux and a deep intrusion of anomalous northerly low-level winds results in enhanced precipitation eventually stretching from Texas to the Great Lakes. On synoptic (4-8 days) timescales the TC moisture Bur variations are associated with the propagation and intensification of a warm-season midlatitude cyclone. This system, which also occurs preferentially during May and June, develops offshore and intensifies as it crosses the Rocky Mountains and taps moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Low-level southerly wind anomalies develop parallel to the mid- and upper-level winds on the leading edge of the trough. Widespread precipitation anomalies move with the propagating system with reduced rainfall occurring over the anomalous surface high, and enhanced rainfall occurring over the anomalous surface low. On still longer timescales (8-16 days) the variations in the TC moisture transport are tied to slow eastward-moving systems. The evolution and structure of the mid- and low-level winds are similar to those of the synoptic-scale system with, however, a somewhat larger zonal scale and spatially more diffuse southerly moisture flux and precipitation anomalies.

The total fallout in the Paris area in 1992 and in 1993 was measured. Fallout was investigated at two stations, urban and rural and the gaseous phase was studied at the rural one. PCB concentrations (0.3-4.9 ng/m(3)) and compositions in the atmosphere and in the fallout (20-520 ng/l) varied, according to the local emission, with the temperature and the direction of wind. Compared to our first results in 1986, there were no changes of pollution levels by organochlorines in that area. Pesticide concentrations in the atmosphere and in the fallout reached maximal values after the local agricultural treatments in spring. No phenylurea was detected in any of the gaseous or liquid samples. Lindane, atrazine and simazine were the main pesticides found. Their levels in the vapour phase, expressed as ng/m(3), were: lindane 0.3-6.3, atrazine < 0.03-2, simazine < 0.03-3; in the fallout, expressed as ng/l they were: lindane 5-350, atrazine 5-380, simazine 5-650. In relative terms, the Parisian area is very small. No difference in the diversity and in the abundance of the micropollutants introduced by the atmosphere was observed between the rural and the urban stations. The pollution level of atrazine was close to that found in Europe and in North America, while the organochlorine and the simazine levels were higher.					teil, m/F-2231-2010														0048-9697					APR 5	1996	182	1-3					25	37		10.1016/0048-9697(95)05032-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)05032-9								8854939					WOS:A1996UF28000004

The waste of Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill causes a real danger of a social and environmental disaster for Lake Baikal and the entire Southern Baikal region, therefore, the problem of developing integrated solutions for dumping the accumulation of lignincontaining waste is especially acute. One of the promising areas for processing this type of waste is the use of natural processes, for example, freezing in winter, temperature detection or self-overgrowth of the occurrence of natural succession. The main aim of the research is to develop an environmentally friendly technology for processing colloidal lignin-containing waste from the pulp and paper industry. Methods: pilot tests at the Solzan industrial site of Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill for freezing lignin-containing wastes and obtaining soils from them by mixing with additives; performing quantitative chemical analysis using the methods of atomic absorption and atomic emission spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, toxicological analysis. Results. Pilot tests have shown that after freezing, the colloidal structure of lignin-containing sediments is destroyed with a decrease in volume up to 40 %, humidity up to 60 %, and also with a decrease in toxicity - from the third (moderately hazardous) to the fourth (low hazardous) and fifth class (practically non-hazardous) of hazard of the waste depending on its composition. After freezing, the resulting sludge with the introduction of various additives (CHP ash, sewage treatment plant sludge) can be used as soil ground and fertilizers for reclamation of disturbed lands and crops. Thus, an environmentally friendly technology was developed for processing waste from the pulp and paper industry to obtain soil ground, which is low-energy and does not contain expensive imported equipment.

Co-limitation by N and P Characterizes Phytoplankton Communities Across Nutrient Availability and Land Use	ECOSYSTEMS												Historically, freshwater lakes have been widely assumed to be singly limited by phosphorus (P) because the dominant paradigm assumes that nitrogen fixation (N(2)fixation) will compensate for any nitrogen (N) deficits. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that primary producer response to nutrient manipulation most frequently indicates co-limitation by N and P. Differences in N and P supply ratio have been shown to influence the identity and severity of nutrient limitation, but whether N and P concentration and the ratio of N to P concentrations can explain the frequency of co-limitation in aquatic primary producer assemblages remains unclear, especially in ecosystems subject to human perturbation that strongly increase nutrient availability. We determined how resource availability influences nutrient limitation by N and P of phytoplankton primary production across 12 lakes in Minnesota that vary in watershed land use and lake nutrient levels. We measured epilimnetic lake metabolism and indicators of N(2)fixation to evaluate their influence on nutrient limitation status of planktonic algal assemblages. Despite large differences in land use (agricultural, urban, and suburban) and water column N and P availability, planktonic algal response to nutrient manipulation was consistently characterized by co-limitation by N and P across years and months. Neither P availability (as concentrations of total and inorganic forms) nor N-2-flux rate predicted responses to nutrient additions. N availability significantly influenced responses of phytoplankton to nutrient additions across years, but this effect was small. The ratio of total N to total P significantly influenced the response to single additions of N and P (these effects were negative and positive, respectively) in summer 2013. Importantly, higher lake primary production and heterocyte count (number of nitrogen fixing cells) were also associated with a stronger, positive response to N + P addition. Overall, these data suggest that planktonic algal assemblages are predominantly characterized by co-limitation by N and P despite large and diverse human impacts on nutrient inputs. Additionally, higher rates of primary production increase the likelihood of co-limitation. Together, these results further support the paradigm shift toward dual management of N and P in aquatic ecosystems.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011; Bratt, Anika/MAI-4779-2025	Bratt, Anika/0000-0002-5640-0957; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				SEP	2020	23	6					1121	1137		10.1007/s10021-019-00459-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00459-6													WOS:000569248700001
J	Luoto, TP; Nevalainen, L				Luoto, Tomi P.; Nevalainen, Liisa			Late Holocene precipitation and temperature changes in Northern Europe linked with North Atlantic forcing	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Long-term paleoclimatic records are needed for understanding natural variability in the context of climate change. Two lake sediment cores were collected from eastern Finland from sites considered sensitive for precipitation and temperature, respectively, over the last similar to 3000 yr. The paleoclimatic reconstructions based on fossil Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) assemblages were considered against a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) reconstruction to disentangle possible forcing mechanisms. Generally low effective precipitation was reconstructed between similar to 3000 and 1500 cal yr BP (calibrated years before present). A distinct stream flow event occurred between similar to 2400 and 2200 cal yr BP, and the highest effective precipitation occurred similar to 1300 cal yr BP. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between similar to 1200 and 800 cal yr BP was dry, but the Little Ice Age (LIA) between similar to 700 and 200 cal yr BP had fluctuating precipitation. The temperature reconstruction depicted a late Holocene cooling trend, which ended at similar to 1300 cal yr BP when the warm MCA began. The MCA was followed by the cold LIA and the last 100 yr have been characterized by rapid warming. Present temperatures are higher than during any time period of the late Holocene. A general trend of positive NAO mode with elevated summer temperatures and dry hydroclimatic conditions prevailed during the MCA and a negative mode with reduced temperatures during the LIA. However, the NAO-hydroclimate relationship over eastern Scandinavia was not straightforward during the LIA, which varied in moisture dynamics. The records from this present study provide a unique climate archive from the crossing point of southern and northern and eastern and western air masses.

Groundwater levels are already very high in Aswan city, but this has not been exploited, and it causes damage to the environment and infrastructure for roads, building, and templets. Rising groundwater leads to the deterioration and poor quality of agricultural lands. The main objective of this study is to assess and investigate the main reasons for the groundwater logging in the tourist city of Aswan using field investigation during different periods and gain a better understanding of the water dynamics in the study area. This study investigated the surface water levels in the High Dam Lake (HDL), the Kima Lake water levels, the recharge in the fish hatchery, the abstraction well rates in Kima and El-Shalal, and the leakage from the drinking water and wastewater network in Aswan city within the study area using field investigation. The results of this study show that the HDL is one of the most important sources feeding the aquifer in the study area, and it affects the rise and fall of the groundwater levels, but it is not the only factor that affects this problem. Moreover, the rise in the groundwater levels was due to the infiltration from the unlinking fish hatchery, the reduction in abstraction well rates from Kima Lake, the lack of abstraction from El shallal region, the increase in the leakage from drinking water pipelines, sewage networks and septic underground wastewater tanks; these factors are affecting groundwater logging in Aswan city. Potential groundwater level maps for the study area were generated using field data and ArcGIS technique for the years 2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2020. Based on the results of the potential groundwater maps, the maximum and minimum difference for the groundwater levels in the study area between 2017 and 2012 reached 12.56 m and 0.83 m, respectively; also, between 2018 and 2017, the levels were 4.34 m and 0.25 m, respectively. Moreover, between 2020 and 2018, they were 8 m and 0.38 m, respectively.					; Negm, Abdelazim/M-2808-2015; Hamdan, Ali/A-7086-2019; Abd-Elaty, Ismail/AAI-9193-2021; Zelenakova, Martina/E-6103-2014	Abd-Elaty, Ismail/0000-0002-5833-2396; Negm, Abdelazim/0000-0002-4838-5558; Hamdan, Ali/0000-0001-8363-9552; Hossen, Hickmat/0000-0002-8507-7001; Zelenakova, Martina/0000-0001-7502-9586														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	8							1233	10.3390/w14081233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14081233													WOS:000786806800001

LIMNOLOGICA												The 'Chicken Creek' artificial catchment area, Welzow-South, E Germany, created to study processes and structures of initial ecosystem development, discharges into a small experimental lake (A=3805 m(2), V=3992 m(3), z(max) = 2.4 m). This lake was man-made in 2005 and filled by natural surface runoff until January 2006. In summer 2006 and 2008, the actual development of sediments and the evolution of the phosphorus (P) cycle were studied. 19.7% of the original lake volume was filled by sediment within the first 3 years. A fine-grained sediment representing silt (6.3-63 mu m) accumulated at high accretion rates at the deepest point (200 mm a(-1), 0-24 mm week 1) due to massive erosion in the catchment. The sediment is low in organic matter (2.5-5.2%) and total P (TP, 0.31-0.97 mg g(-1)). Low amounts of P associated with degradable organic matter and surplus of metal hydroxides (Fe:P similar to 40, Al:P similar to 20) favor an efficient P binding and low dissolved P concentrations in pore water (1-107 mu g l(-1)). Hence, the mineral sediment quality and the low rates of P release (0.06 mg m(-2) d(-1)) revealed that a lake at an initial stage of development has essentially no sedimentary P cycle compared to eutrophic shallow lakes. However, the increasing emersed and submersed macrophyte growth will control further lake succession by intensifying the internal nutrient cycling. The macrophytes drive the evolution of a sedimentary P cycle by mobilizing and translocating P, by accumulating carbon and thus by stimulating microbial and redox processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Glacial curvilineations found along the southern sector of the Laurentide Ice sheet and a hypothesis of formation involving subglacial slope failure in tunnel valleys and subglacial lakes	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												First discovered in Poland, glacial curvilineations (GCLs) are enigmatic landforms comprising parallel sets of sinuous ridges and troughs of metres amplitude and around 150m wavelength, found within kilometres-wide valleys interpreted as being produced by meltwater flowing subglacially. Their morphological and sedimentary characteristics and association with tunnel valleys has been described for some prominent Polish examples. From these observations the existing hypothesis is that they form as a consequence of erosion by longitudinal vortices that develop in subglacial floods. Here we report, for the first time, GCLs found along the southern sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in three northern states of the USA. Using mapping and topographic analysis from high resolution digital elevation models we report observations on their morphological properties and landform associations. We find aspects of their context and morphology difficult to explain using the existing hypothesis. We instead suggest that these glacial curvilineations are produced by subglacial bank and slope failures that locally widen tunnel valleys, or that occur near subglacial lake shorelines. Further investigation is required to test this hypothesis and to ascertain the mechanisms of proposed mass movements, which may have occurred by rotational or translational slope failure or by creep deformation. Our preferred mechanism is that such movements occurred where subglacial water was emplaced over previously perma-frozen ground. Under such circumstances, sediment blocks thawed by the water may then easily glide over a frozen decollement at low slope angles; analogous to subaerial active-layer glides in permafrost environments. Permafrost spring sapping may have provided lines of weakness for slope failure. If the requirement for permafrost is found to hold, then GCLs may become an important indicator of the palaeo-distribution of permafrost.

The evolution of the geothermal water and the distribution of elements during the phase separation of residual liquid and associated deposits remain unclear. Through a chemical analysis of the deposits and geothermal water in the Kawu area during primary discharge and later evaporation, the elemental distribution and enrichment processes between the two phases of deposits and the mother water are discussed. Basic results show that the elements Li, B and K are preferentially enriched in the geothermal water rather than distributed into the geothermal deposits of travertine during the primary phase separation of geothermal water discharge. The elements B and K, as a whole, are enriched in the late residual mother water in the later stages during evapoconcentration. However, Li shows a distinctly depleted trend in the residual mother water at the stage when the lithium carbonate precipitates in the deposits. The most important finding of the evapoconcentration experiment is that the zabuyelite, an unusual lithium carbonate mineral, is firstly detected in the mineral association of geothermal deposits. It is only precipitated within a very small interval during an intermediate stage with a very high concentration of Li while there are very low concentrations of Ca and Mg and an unusually high Li/Mg ratio in the mother geothermal water. The zabuyelite is a trademark mineral in the salt lake deposits in the Tibetan Plateau. This is the first time it has been found in the mineral association of deposits of evapoconcentrated geothermal water. This indicates that geothermal water discharge may be the main source for Li, B and K accumulation in the salt lakes. In addition, the typical elements of Li, B and K are extremely enriched during the late stage of the residual mother water or precipitate as zabuyelite or sylvite within a very concentrative stage. They are also very promising mineral resources for development and utilization.

Evaporative Weathering of Diluted Bitumen Films	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY												One of the issues for the pipeline transportation of diluted bitumen (dilbit) is the fate and behaviour of the dilbit if it is spilled in freshwater systems; in particular, the evaporation rate and the change in physical properties of the film after evaporation and exposure to water (weathering). In this study, the evaporative weathering of dilbit Cold Lake Winter Blend (CLWB) and light crude oil Alberta Sweet Blend (ASB) films were compared. Evaporation rates were measured for films on glass over time (up to 30 days) at different air-flow rates and at temperatures of 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. The solvent content, density, and viscosity of the films were measured after different weathering times. A second set of tests at 15 degrees C was performed on both dilbit and light-crudeoil films on water. As expected, the mass-transfer rate increased with increasing temperature and decreasing film thickness in all cases. The evaporation of the dilbit was found to be limited by the diffusion rate of the lighter components through the film while that of the light crude oil was limited by convective mass transfer to the air above. The density and viscosity of both the CLWB and ASB films correlated to the amount of evaporated material at all conditions examined, including different film thicknesses, temperatures, and air-flow rates. It appears that the volatile components evaporate in the same order at any conditions; therefore, film composition, density, and viscosity are only functions of the amount evaporated. The evaporation rates, density, and viscosity of CLWB and ASB films weathered over water were identical to those corresponding films weathered on glass, within the error of the measurements; that is, contact with still water had no effect on weathering.																			0021-9487	2156-4663				JUL	2015	54	4					233	244																WOS:000360830500005

Stable isotope analyses of NO2-, NO3-, and N2O in the hypersaline ponds and soils of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced in significant quantities in the soils and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Unraveling the mechanisms of N2O production in these soils and ponds is of great interest due to the extreme arid and cold conditions, which are hostile to life. Recent studies have shown production of N2O having unique stable isotopic signatures in certain Dry Valley soils through abiotic reduction of nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) on active surfaces of Fe(II)-containing minerals, a process known as ` chemodenitrification'. In this study, delta 5N and delta 18O of N2O, NO2-, and NO3-, as well as the N2O site preference (SP), were measured at three sites to evaluate the role of chemodenitrification in N2O production. The delta 15 N and delta 18O values in NO3- indicated an atmospheric source, while d 15 N values in NO2- (-150 parts per thousand) were indicative of abiotic reactions. Instead of finding unique SP values for N2O at Dry Valley sites, SP values mostly fell within the range associated with microbial N2O production mechansims. The d 15 N and d 18 O of N2O were also within a range of values expected for various biological N2O production mechanisms. However, efforts to detect biological activity in Don Juan Pond (DJP), a hypersaline pond in the Wright Valley, have been largely unsuccessful. We consider two possible scenarios for N2O production at DJP: (1) abiotic production in the pond, or (2) biological production in nearby freshwater and transport to the pond. Although little is known about the isotopic systematics of abiotic N2O production, these results indicate that if the observed N2O was produced by an abiotic mechanism, its isotopic signature is indistinguishable from that expected from a mixture of several microbial processes and thus, the formation pathway cannot be determined from isotopic composition alone.

J	MARTIN, CW				MARTIN, CW			RADIOCARBON AGES ON LATE PLEISTOCENE LOESS STRATIGRAPHY OF NEBRASKA AND KANSAS, CENTRAL GREAT-PLAINS, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In the central Great Plains of the United States, radiocarbon dating of loess and buried soils is clarifying the late Quaternary loess chronology for the period 25,000 to 10,000 BP. Along Harlan Lake, Nebraska, a soil developed in the Gilman Canyon Formation and overlain by Peoria Loess has radiocarbon ages on soil humates of 30,700 to 21,500 BP. At one site, two Picea charcoal bands in the lower meter of Peoria Loess have radiocarbon ages of 21,250 and 19,730 BP. Therefore, in the vicinity of Hartan Lake, deposition of Peoria Loess apparently began around 2 1,000 BP. Peoria Loess deposition appears to have been interrupted by an episode of river entrenchment prior to 12,600 BP. Spring activity shortly thereafter suggests that incision was coeval to an increase in effective moisture. The termination of Peoria Loess deposition is marked by the Brady Soil, which in the Harlan Lake area has radiocarbon ages on soil humates of 11.800 to 10,200 BP. Comparison of the Harlan Lake chronology with chronologies completed elsewhere in the central Great Plains reveals general synchrony among periods of pedogenesis and Peoria Loess deposition. Little is known, however, about vegetation conditions in the region when loess was accumulating. Charcoal has been noted chiefly in the basal Peoria Loess, suggesting that some trees were present during initial Peoria Loess deposition. The extent of this tree cover is unknown. however. Charcoal is rare in the middle and upper Peoria Loess.																			0277-3791						1993	12	3					179	188		10.1016/0277-3791(93)90052-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(93)90052-N													WOS:A1993MR65600003

Recent excavations uncovered Middle Neolithic (MN) sites near the prehistoric lakeshore, with the site Reichenau-B33 providing a bioarchaeological assemblage. Anthracological, carpological, and archaeozoological results from Reichenau-B33, embedded in the analysis of a large bioarchaeological dataset, covering Early Neolithic (Linearbandkeramik) and MN (Hinkelstein, Grossgartach, R & ouml;ssen) assemblages from southwest Germany allow elucidating subsistence adaptations of these first farmers. Wood exploitation targeted the site's hinterland, relying mainly on oak, beech and ash. The charred carpological assemblage reveals typical MN crops with naked barley, emmer, and einkorn, while pulses and oil crops are very rare. Two Chenopodium album seeds concentrations reflect the routine exploitation of wild plants also mirrored at several other MN sites. The faunal assemblage of Reichenau-B33 is dominated by red deer (>70%) and includes low proportions of domestic pig and sheep/goat. Thus, the first farmers at Lake Constance adapted to a forested landscape, in which clearings for settlements and fields likely attracted wild herbivores that were routinely hunted. This focus on red deer hunting may have been an opportunistic response, allowing obtaining animal resources while conserving the small herds of livestock and protecting crop fields.

The developed conceptual model for this active hydrothermal system reveals that all waters can be classified by Na-HCO3, Na-Cl and Na-SO4 types and are of meteoric origin. This is confirmed by the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope data that are positioned close to the local meteoric water line (-4.1 parts per thousand <=delta O-18(H2O) <= 5.2 parts per thousand; -17.6 parts per thousand <= 0.5 delta D-H2O <= 5 20.4), except for the Na-CI type water at Ferraria (Sete Cidades area), which is characterized by admixing of seawater. The stable isotope composition of Sao Miguel hydrothermal solutions (delta O-34(S3)4 range from 21.3 to 3.7; delta O-18(SO4) range between 0.5 and 10.5%.; delta C-13(TDIC) = -4.5 +/- 3.2%0 indicate that waters are individually evolved by several processes: evaporation, uptake of volcanogenic sulphur and carbon dioxide, leaching of local volcanic rocks (driven by high CO2 contents and/or elevated temperature), and biological activity. Latter hydrochemical superimposition is displayed by stromatolitic structures in the precipitates at the given site. Dissolved REE data show similar pattern as local volcanic rocks. In particular the distinct Eu anomaly hints to preferential leaching of locally occurring trachyte. The strongly acidic Na-SO4 waters sampled in boiling pools at Fogo and Furnas Lake indicate high leaching levels and LREE depletion versus HREE compared with the volcanic local rock compositions. Depletion in LREE is most likely caused by its preferential removal compared to HREE by the co-precipitation with alunite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on the Holocene and the eastern region of the TP, but here, we establish a relationship between modern pollen data (including both pollen percentage and concentration) and vegetation cover using a random forest (RF) model based on 362 soil-surface samples from the TP, as well as using it to quantitatively reconstruct the vegetation cover history of the Dagze Co (central TP, covering the last 19.5 cal. ka BP) and Koucha Lake (eastern TP, covering the last 33.8 cal. ka BP) regions. The RF results indicate that both the models based on pollen percentages or concentrations perform similarly (former: R2 = 0.538, RMSEP = 19.772%; latter: R2 = 0.540, RMSEP = 19.723%). However, when considering the reconstructed vegetation cover of Dagze Co and Koucha Lake, the results based on pollen concentrations appear to be more reliable. Before 13.4 and 16.8 cal. ka BP, Dagze Co and Koucha Lake has low vegetation cover of 25% and 30%, respectively, dominated by alpine desert or desert steppe. After that, changes in vegetation cover show different trends. At Dagze Co, the vegetation cover reaches a high level (54%) between 13.4 and 5.3 cal. ka BP, followed by a decrease until it starts increasing again at 2 cal. ka BP, in response to the change in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). At Koucha Lake, the vegetation cover fluctuates at around 60%, indicating less sensitivity to climate change. Our research highlights the importance of pollen concentrations in quantitatively reconstructing past vegetation cover and the sparse vegetation status during the LGM on the TP.

Development of a regional glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT)-temperature calibration for Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lakes	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												A regional network of quantitative reconstructions of past climate variability is required to test climate models. In recent studies, temperature calibration models based on the relative abundances of sedimentary glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have enabled past temperature reconstructions in both marine and terrestrial environments. Nevertheless, to date these methods have not been widely applied in high latitude environments due to poor performance of the GDGT-temperature calibrations at lower temperatures. To address this we studied 32 lakes from Antarctica, the sub-Antarctic Islands and Southern Chile to: 1) quantify their GDGT composition and investigate the environmental controls on GDGT composition; and 2) develop a GDGT-temperature calibration model for inferring past temperatures from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lakes. GDGTs were found in all 32 lakes studied and in 31 lakes branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) were the dominant compounds. Statistical analyses of brGDGT composition in relation to temperature, pH, conductivity and water depth showed that the composition of brGDGTs is strongly correlated with mean summer air temperature (MSAT). This enabled the development of the first regional brGDGT-temperature calibration for use in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lakes using four brGDGT compounds (GDGT-Ib, GDGT-II, GDGT-III and GDGT-IIIb). A key discovery was that GDGT-Illb is of particular importance in cold lacustrine environments. The addition of this compound significantly improved the model's performance from r(2) = 0.67, RMSEP-LOO (leave-one-out) = 2.23 degrees C, RMSEP-H (h-block) = 2.37 degrees C when applying the re-calibrated global GDGT-temperature calibration to our Antarctic dataset to r(2) = 0.83, RMSEP-LOO = 1.68 C, RMSEP-H = 1.65 degrees C for our new Antarctic calibration. This shows that Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, and possibly other high latitude, palaeotemperature reconstructions should be based on a regional GDGT-temperature calibration where specific compounds can be identified and included to improve model performance. Finally, downcore temperature reconstructions using the new Antarctic brGDGT-temperature calibration were tested in sub-Antarctic Fan Lake from South Georgia providing a proof of concept for the new calibration model in the Southern Hemisphere.

Guides that typically seek striped bass Morone saxatilis switch to blue catfish, particularly during the winter months when the largest individuals are most vulnerable. Low frequency electrofishing samples, collected since the early 1990s by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, indicate that population abundance is stable but concerns have been raised over the long term viability of the fishery in the face of increased angling pressure on the largest individuals. Baseline age and growth data, using otoliths, were collected from both the Red River arm and Washita River arm in 2003 (N = 333). Mortality rates were estimated using the Fishery Analysis Simulation Tools model. Growth rates, particularly of fish age >= 6, were highly variable. The oldest fish collected was age 16 and weighed 20.43 kg. Growth rates of the smaller individuals (ages 1, 3, 4, 5) were higher in the Red River arm than in the Washita River arm. No differences were found in growth rates of older fish, likely due to the high variation in mean length at age. Blue catfish from Lake Texoma reach 762 mm (4.5 kg) in approximately 12 years. Total annual mortality estimates (A) from the Red River arm and Washita River arm were 13.5% and 17.0%, respectively (A = 18.8% for both arms combined). Even though these mortality estimates are low relative to that of other freshwater sport fishes, given the length of time it takes to reach a size being targeted by guides and their clients, options to limit harvest of large blue catfish may need to be considered in the future.																									2004							57	65																WOS:000235161800007
J	Fillmore, J; Coulson, IM				Fillmore, Julie; Coulson, Ian M.			Petrological and geochemical constraints on the origin of adakites in the Garibaldi Volcanic Complex, southwestern British Columbia, Canada	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Garibaldi Volcanic Complex (GVC) is located in southwestern British Columbia and comprises two related but distinct volcanic fields: the Garibaldi Lake and the Mount Garibaldi volcanic fields. The rocks of the GVC range from basalt to rhyolite, and analyses of samples from both fields distinguish these as adakites. The GVC magmas have high Sr/Y, Mg-#, and Al2O3; low K2O/Na2O; and fractionated rare earth element compositions. Models of adakite genesis fall into two main groups: slab melting and non-slab melting. Adakites generated by slab melting commonly occur from young subducting crust (<= 25 Ma) and are felsic partial melts of the subducting slab that interact with the mantle wedge during ascent. Non-slab melting models vary widely and include basalt fractionation, assimilation, fractional crystallization processes and partial melting of mafic lower crust. Data from the GVC are too limited to fully elucidate the mechanisms of adakite genesis; however, the petrographical and geochemical characteristics of the GVC rocks in this study do not refute an origin by slab partial melts. Variations in trace elements that reflect non-adakitic values (e. g., low La, low Cr) are likely the result of magma mixing at shallow depths within the magma reservoirs of each center, for which there is mineralogical and textural evidence. The adakite rocks of the GVC share geochemical traits akin to both low-SiO2 adakite (LSA) and high-SiO2 adakite (HSA) groups, though additional data are needed to investigate whether LSA- or HSA-type dominates within the GVC, and by extension, which should be the preferred model of adakite genesis.																			0258-8900	1432-0819				JUL	2013	75	7							730	10.1007/s00445-013-0730-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-013-0730-5													WOS:000321776200007
J	Sheppard, NLM; Pham, J; Ricciardi, A				Sheppard, Noemie L. M.; Pham, Jennifer; Ricciardi, Anthony			Influence of reproductive state and temperature on the functional response of the marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Predictive information on the trophic impacts of an invasive consumer can be gained by experimentally measuring its functional response- the rate of prey consumption in relation to available prey density. However, a common gap in such information is how functional response varies with the consumer's reproductive state and thermal environment. Here, we tested the effect of reproductive state and temperature on the functional response of the marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis), a parthenogenetic species that is popular in the pet trade and considered to be an invasion threat to freshwater habitats globally, including the North American Great Lakes. We applied two thermal treatments: 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C, representing current and projected mean summer surface water temperatures, respectively, for nearshore areas of the lower Great Lakes. We found that gravid individuals readily fed on benthic invertebrate prey (chironomid larvae), but their rate of consumption was substantially reduced compared with non-gravid individuals at both temperatures. When tested at 26 degrees C, the functional response of gravid individuals did not change, whereas non gravid individuals exhibited an increase in attack rate and a reduction in maximum feeding rate. A generalized linear model of bootstrapped attack rates and handling times showed that these parameters were affected by temperature and reproductive state. In addition, warming altered reproductive cycles by increasing the frequency and duration of gravid states. Our findings suggest that invasive species risk assessments would be better informed by quantifying variation in invader per capita effects across reproductive cycles and temperatures.					; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010	Pham, Jennifer/0000-0002-7986-4949; Sheppard, Noemie/0000-0001-9081-8022													1387-3547	1573-1464				JAN	2024	26	1					9	16		10.1007/s10530-023-03166-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-023-03166-5		SEP 2023											WOS:001074257500001
J	Nicholls, KH; Carney, EC				Nicholls, Kenneth H.; Carney, Elaine C.			The phytoplankton of the Bay of Quinte, 1972-2008: point-source phosphorus loading control, dreissenid mussel establishment, and a proposed community reference	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The objective of this contribution is to further the understanding of long-term (37 years) changes in the composition and biomass of the phytoplankton of the Bay of Quinte (northeastern Lake Ontario), especially those changes associated with the simultaneous point-source phosphorus loading reduction/white perch winter kill of early 1978 and the establishment of dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990's. The relatively shallow and polymictic upper bay has facilitated the ice-free period domination of the phytoplankton by meroplanktonic diatoms (especially Aulacoseira spp.); while a more balanced representation by several algal Divisions has characterized the thermally stratified, dimictic lower bay. At all three stations (upper bay, middle bay and lower bay), phytoplankton biomass declined and community similarity decreased after both the phosphorus loading and the Dreissena interventions, but the biomass changes associated with the P load reduction were greater than those associated with Dreissena establishment. Conversely, the loss of phytoplankton community similarity after Dreissena establishment was greater than that associated with P loading reduction at all three stations. The Remedial Action Plan phytoplankton objective of 4-5 mm(3) l(-1) (May-October mean) has been met inconsistently since the establishment of Dreissena. The post-Dreissena period, however, was also characterized by occasional very high biomass values for the potentially toxic cyanoprokaryote (blue-green alga) Microcystis, as well as by a dramatic decline in the bloom-forming blue-green Aphanizomenon, and the near extirpation of the diatoms, Tabellaria and Synedra spp. A partially synthetic phytoplankton community was constructed using data taken from three local aquatic systems (Trenton Bay, upper Hay Bay and West Lake). This might be used as a reference against which past and future changes in the upper Bay of Quinte phytoplankton can be compared and evaluated.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2011	14	1					33	43		10.1080/14634988.2011.550847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.550847													WOS:000288197500005
J	Wu, JP; Jiao, WJ; Ming, YH; Su, W				Wu, Jianping; Jiao, Wenjie; Ming, Yuehong; Su, Wei			Attenuation of coda waves at the Changbaishan Tianchi volcanic area in Northeast China	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												21 earthquakes recorded by a temporary seismic network in the Changbaishan Tianchi volcanic area in Northeast China operated during the summer of 2002 and 2003 were analyzed to estimate the S coda attenuation. The attenuation quality factor Q(c) was estimated using the single scattering attenuation model of Sato (1977) in the frequency band from 4 to 24 Hz. All the events studied in this paper occurred at depths from 2 to 6 km with ML of 1.4-2.8. The epicentral distances are less than 25 km. For all events which occurred near the Tianchi Lake (caldera), the Q(c) patterns obtained at the stations near the lake are similar, and the Q(c) values are relatively small. At the stations located about 15 km east of the Tianchi Lake, however, the average Q(c) is significantly higher. For an event which occurred 25km from the lake to the west, Q(c) patterns derived at the stations near the lake are quite similar to the above mentioned Q(c) for stations located in the east. Further study shows that Q(c) value in the north and central areas of the volcano is relatively lower than that in the surrounding area. Compared to other volcanic areas in the world, the average Q(c) of the Changbaishan Tianchi volcanic area is obviously lower. The deep seismic sounding and teleseismic receiver function studies indicated more than one lower velocity layer in the crust. The MT studies suggested the presence of high conductive bodies beneath the area. We interpret the strong attenuation of coda waves near the Changbaishan Tianchi volcano as being possibly related to high temperature medium caused by shallow magma chambers.																			0033-4553	1420-9136				JUL	2006	163	7					1351	1368		10.1007/s00024-006-0076-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-006-0076-4													WOS:000239248800008
J	SEPHTON, DH; HARRIS, GP				SEPHTON, DH; HARRIS, GP			PHYSICAL VARIABILITY AND PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES .6. DAY TO DAY CHANGES IN PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND SPECIES ABUNDANCE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Daily rates of primary productivity in Hamilton Harbour (Lake Ontario [Canada]) during the summer of 1979 were more variable than anticipated (cf. Harris et al., 1980). Day to day integral productivity was largely determined by changes in the maximum volumetric rate of photosynthesis and in the assimilation number or photosynthetic capacity. The values of the assimilaton number, photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter of photosynthesis fluctuated from day to day and they were correlated with changing environmental parameters at scales of 1-7 days. Cross-covariance analysis showed that the assimilation number lagged behind changes in the water column stability by 1 day. The light saturation parameter of photosynthesis responded to changes in the integral irradiance with a lag of 1 day. Time series analysis suggests that the resident algal species responded differently to environmental changes with different temporal lags. Statistically significant internal periods (auto-correlations) may reflect the generation times of several species. Cyclotella increased in abundance in response to increased vertical mixing with Stephanodiscus responded negatively to changes in water column stability. Rhodomonas and Cryptomonas responded negatively to environmental fluctuations with lags of 1-5 days, while Chlamydomonas responded positively with a lag of 2 days. Oocystis and Scenedesmus were most abundant during periods of thermal stability and Coelastrum responded positively to changes in water column stability with a lag of 4 days. These lag periods may represent an adaptive response to environmental change or changes in the community.																			0003-9136						1984	102	2					155	175																WOS:A1984TZ08900002

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In recent years, trait-based research on zooplankton has gained importance to enable comprehensive interpretation of ecosystem processes, but this approach is still limited in inland waters. Wetlands, one of the most important inland water resources, provide many ecological and economic services in the ecosystem, but like all other water bodies in the world, they are under threat of deterioration and depletion for various reasons. In this study, the taxonomic structure of the zooplankton community in Lake Manyas, one of the important wetlands of Turkiye, as well as their functional characteristics such as body size (small, large) and feeding strategies (microphagous, raptorials) were investigated monthly between 2019 and 2020. The hypothesis that environmental variables influence the species composition and functional groups of zooplankton was tested, given that their structure is shaped by environmental gradients. A total of 62 taxa, including rotifer-dominated, cosmopolite and eutrophication indicator species, were identified. These taxa categorized into three functional groups dominated by small microphagous. Although the zooplankton structure had a high taxonomic diversity, functional homogeneity was observed which reflected a low grazing rate in the ecosystem. Albeit water temperature and total organic carbon significantly affected the distribution of all functional groups, each dominant taxa interacted with different environmental variables. Changing environmental conditions in the lake affected the presence and/or quantity of the zooplankton functional groups (ZFGs). The results showed that ZFGs are strongly associated with environmental conditions and that the response of trait-based functional groups to environmental changes can provide useful knowledge about aquatic ecosystem's health.

The water samples were taken from eighteen sampling sites covering the downstream part of the two drains before reaching Lake Mariout Main Basin (LMMB) and Lake Mariout Fishery Basin (LMFB) during the summer period. The samples collected were analyzed for Cu, Cd, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, Fe and Al. Pollution loading index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (C-F), Geo accumulation index (I-geo) and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) were calculated as a criterion of possible contamination. Qalaa Drain is characterized by a low pH value of 6.93 compared to the other waters in the studied areas. The lowest Cl was always recorded in the water of Qalaa Drain with an average of 0.65 g Cl/L. The water of Umum Drain, LMMB and LMFB are continually aerated with O-2 concentration, compared to the Qalaa drain, which constantly carries H2S. The outcomes revealed that the concentrations of the dissolved metals are at suitable levels according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Fe and Al are the two abundant metals in the sediment of the four studied areas. The order of abundance of the metals in the sediments of the present study areas was Fe > Al > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > Co > Cd. For the sediments, only cadmium and zinc concentrations in all sites during the study period exceeded the average shale rock concentration. According to the examined indices, the level of contamination in Qalaa Drain ranges from considerable to extremely high. Additionally, the four examined regions have higher Cu and Zn contents than SQGs.

J	Batts, W; Yun, S; Hedrick, R; Winton, J				Batts, William; Yun, Susan; Hedrick, Ronald; Winton, James			A novel member of the family Hepeviridae from cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii)	VIRUS RESEARCH												Beginning in 1988, the Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cell line was used to isolate a novel virus from spawning adult trout in the state of California, USA. Termed the cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) virus (DV), the small, round virus was not associated with disease, but was subsequently found to be present in an increasing number of trout populations in the western USA, likely by a combination of improved surveillance activities and the shipment of infected eggs to new locations. Here, we report that the full length genome of the 1988 Heenan Lake isolate of DV consisted of 7269 nucleotides of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA beginning with a 5' untranslated region (UTR), followed by three open reading frames (ORFs), a 3' UTR and ending in a polyA tail. The genome of DV was similar in size and organization to that of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) with which it shared the highest nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities. Similar to the genomes of human, rodent or avian hepeviruses, ORF 1 encoded a large, non-structural polyprotein that included conserved methyltransferase, protease, helicase and polymerase domains, while ORF 2 encoded the structural capsid protein and ORF 3 the phosphoprotein. Together, our data indicated that DV was clearly a member of the family Hepeviridae, although the level of amino acid sequence identity with the ORFs of mammalian or avian hepeviruses (13-27%) may be sufficiently low to warrant the creation of a novel genus. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis using a 262 nt region within ORF 1 for 63 isolates of DV obtained from seven species of trout reared in various geographic locations in the western USA. While the sequences fell into two genetic clades, the overall nucleotide diversity was low (less than 8.4%) and many isolates differed by only 1-2 nucleotides, suggesting an epidemiological link. Finally, we showed that DV was able to form persistently infected cultures of the CHSE-214 cell line that may have use in research on the biology or treatment of hepevirus infections of humans or other animals.

J	Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A				Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A			Shallow lakes in lowland river systems: Role in transport and transformations of nutrients and in biological diversity	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				Shallow, small-sized, macrophyte-dominated lakes are frequently inserted into the upstream, initial sections of low-grade river systems in post-glacial lowland landscapes. In terms of the River Continuum Concept they function as 'disturbing inserts' which are: 1. sinks for transported nitrate nitrogen by providing more sites for effective denitrification (anoxic, organic sediments, vegetation beds), 2. usually sink also for total phosphorus fluvial load except in summer periods when the net export of this nutrient takes place due to internal loading, being the source of it for downstream river section, 3. transform the coarse, low-organic fluvial suspended matter into the subtle, rich-organic suspension in which living plankton organisms are present. One can say that these lakes being a stagnant section of a system, are shortening the length of nutrient spiralling within the river ecosystem. The fluvial lakes increase the patchiness of a river system providing the sites for aquatic vegetation patches and sediment patches more stable in relation to typical river conditions; in this way, they enlarge the area of refuges in a river system. The greater the refugial area in a system the more stabilised are the predator (fish) - prey (invertebrates) relations in the river food web. The inflows (deltas) as well as outflows from the lake are important sites for the transformation of fluvial matter and nutrients, as well as for river habitat patchiness. The lakes inserted into the fluvial system thus provide the examples of the Serial Discontinuity analogical to the man-made impoundments on a large river system.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						349	358		10.1023/A:1017034813729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017034813729													WOS:000084892400039

Orthoptera assemblages associated with macrophytes of floodplain lakes of the Parana River	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA												Orthoptera assemblages associated with macrophytes of floodplain lakes of the Parana River. The Orthoptera assemblage composition varies considerably, depending on habitat type. This study examines the spatiotemporal relationship between plant diversity, hydrometric level, environmental variables and the Orthoptera richness and abundance in floodplain lakes connected permanently or temporarily with the main channel of the Parana River. The grasshoppers were collected fortnightly (April 2006 May 2007). A total of 17 species were recorded and classified according to their frequency of occurrence in constant (7), accessory (4), or accidental (6) species. In the two lakes, the greater species richness and abundance was recorded in summer, thereby coinciding with the highest water level of the Parana River. The most significant correlation between the orthopteran richness and abundance was with the water level. The aquatic plant richness was significantly different between the lakes, but the vegetation was dominated by Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms. (Liliales, Pontederiaceae). The lake, which was connected permanently, presented the highest values of diversity and abundance, proving to be a more diverse assemblage. The beta diversity was higher in the temporary connected lake than in the permanently connected one. The orthopterans assemblages were different between the lakes, Cornops aquaticum and Tucayaca gracilis were the species that contributed more to the level of dissimilarity. C. aquaticum was more representative in the lake temporarily connected, while T gracilis in the permanent connected one. The water level of the Parana River and the connectivity of the floodplain lakes play an important role to explain the abundance and richness of their orthopteran assemblages.

Chemical Weathering Patterns of Diluted Bitumen Spilled into Freshwater Limnocorrals	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Hydrocarbonsare rapidly depleted from diluted bitumen followingspills into freshwater, and diagnostic ratios help to elucidate majorweathering processes. Due to the sudden nature of oil spills, few controlledstudieshave documented how oil weathers immediately following accidentalrelease into a natural lake environment. Here, we evaluated the weatheringpatterns of Cold Lake Winter Blend, a diluted bitumen (dilbit) product,by performing a series of controlled spills into limnocorrals installedin a freshwater lake in Northern Ontario, Canada. Using a regression-baseddesign, we added seven different dilbit volumes, ranging from 1.5to 180 L, resulting in oil-to-water ratios between 1:71,000 (v/v)and 1:500 (v/v). We monitored changes in the composition of variouspetroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs), including n-alkanes,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and oil biomarkers in dilbitover time, as it naturally weathered for 70 days. Depletion rate constants(k (D)) of n-alkanes andPAHs ranged from 0.0009 to 0.41 d(-1) and 0.0008 to0.38 d(-1), respectively. There was no significantrelationship between k (D) and spill volume,suggesting that spill size did not influence the depletion of petroleumhydrocarbons from the slick. Diagnostic ratios calculated from concentrationsof n-alkanes, isoprenoids, and PAHs indicated thatevaporation and photooxidation were major processes contributing todilbit weathering, whereas dissolution and biodegradation were lessimportant. These results demonstrate the usefulness of large scalefield studies carried out under realistic environmental conditionsto elucidate the role of different weathering processes followinga dilbit spill.

The development of the FCS dune and its relationship with palaeoenvironmental changes are still unknown. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating approach utilizing a pIRIR150 (post infrared, infrared stimulated luminescence at 150 degrees C) single aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose protocol for K-rich feldspar, in combination with radiocarbon dates and high resolution sedimentological analyzes, have proven to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the depositional history of the FCS dune and the related palaeoenvironmental conditions during the late Holocene. This study identified three major aeolian sediment accumulation periods at similar to 4 ka to similar to 2.3 ka, similar to 1.8 ka to similar to 1.1 ka, and similar to 0.7 ka to similar to 0.4 ka, which are consistent with the cold/cooling periods identified from the palaeoclimate record of the Dongyuan Lake in southern Taiwan. Two palaeosurfaces and two short interruptions of sand accumulation indicate periods of surface stabilization at the FCS site. The OSL ages and radiocarbon ages from the dune, and the palaeoclimate data from Dongyuan Lake suggest that these surfaces developed at similar to 4.3 ka, similar to 2 ka, similar to 1 ka and similar to 0.3 ka. The palaeoclimatic conditions inferred from the FCS dunes are largely consistent with those reconstructed for the coastal dunes of the Fulong Beach area in northeastern Taiwan. This may indicate an over-regional pattern of dune formation primarily driven by strong winds of the Asian Winter Monsoon as the primary forcing factor for coastal dune development in Taiwan during the late Holocene.					; Yen, JY/AAJ-2021-2020	Luthgens, Christopher/0000-0003-3211-6318; Yen, Jiun-Yee/0000-0001-6942-9364													1367-9120	1878-5786				OCT 15	2017	148						13	30		10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.08.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.08.024													WOS:000413384800002

In the laboratory, organic material collected with phytoplankton nets was added to undisturbed sediment cores receiving the following four treatments: (1) addition of organic material and aeration of the water overlying the sediment, (2) only aeration, (3) only organic material addition, and (4) no organic material addition or aeration. Changes in microbial activity and biomass in the sediments were followed during six days at an experimental temperature of 4 degrees C by means of measurements of heat production, bacterial production ([H-3]thymidine incorporation), oxygen consumption, bacterial biomass, ATP concentration and chlorophyll a concentration. In treatments with organic material additions, a response in terms of simultaneously increasing heat production, bacterial production and oxygen consumption rates was observed. Microbial activity increased slowly during the first four days in cores with organic matter addition, and between Days 4 and 6 microbial activity approximately doubled in aerated cores and decreased in non-aerated cores. Mineralization rates calculated from heat production showed that a small proportion of the added organic matter was mineralized in the surface sediment during the experiment. The results of this study show that the benthic microbial community could respond to an input of organic material at low temperature within a few days. A well oxygenated overlying water phase was necessary for the response to proceed.																			1323-1650						1995	46	1					33	43		10.1071/MF9950033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9950033													WOS:A1995RR56200004

ASTER and MODIS are both spaceborne imaging instruments on the Tel-ra platform launched in the fall of 1999. Currently MASTER is flown on the Department of Energy (DOE) King Air Beachcraft B200 aircraft and the NASA DC-8. In older to validate the in-flight performance of the instrument, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona conducted a joint experiment in December 1998. The experiment involved overflights of the MASTER instrument at two sites at three elevations (2000, 4000, and 6000 m). The two sites: Ivanpah Playa, California, and Lake Mead, Nevada, were selected to validate the visible-shortwave infrared and thermal infrared (TIR) channels, respectively. At Ivanpah Playa, a spectrometer was used to determine the surface reflectance and a sun photometer used to obtain the optical depth. At Lake Mead contact and radiometric surface lake temperatures were measured by buoy-mounted thermistors and self-calibrating radiometers, respectively. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity were obtained by launching an atmospheric sounding balloon. The measured surface radiances were then propagated to the at-sensor radiance using radiative transfer models driven by the local atmospheric data. There was excellent agreement between the predicted radiance at sensor and the measured radiance at sensor at all three altitudes. The percent difference between the channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere in the visible-shortwave infrared was typically 1-5% and the percent difference between the TIR channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere was typically less than 0.5%. These results indicate the MASTER instrument should provide a well-calibrated instrument for Earth Science Studies. It should prove particularly valuable for those studies that leverage information across the electromagnetic spectrum from the visible to the TIR. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Selenium concentrations in livers varied based on when the grebes were collected (lower in September [mean +/- standard error, 9.4 +/- 0.7 mu g/g dry wt] than in November [14.5 +/- 1.4 mu g/g]), on where the birds were collected on the Great Salt Lake (Antelope Island, 8.6 +/- 0.5 mu g/g; Stansbury Island, 15.2 +/- 1.4 mu g/g), and on the grebe's age (juveniles, 8.5 +/- 1.5 mu g/g; adults, 15.8 +/- 1.3 mu g/g), but not by sex. Selenium concentrations in blood differed only by collection site (Antelope Island, 16.8 +/- 2.3 mu g/g; Stansbury Island, 25.4 +/- 3.0 mu g/g). Mercury concentration in the blood of grebes varied by when the grebes were collected (September, 5.6 +/- 0.5 mu g/g; November, 8.4 +/- 1.2 mu g/g), where the birds were collected (Antelope Island, 4.3 +/- 0.5 mu g/g; Stansbury Island, 10.1 +/- 2.6 mu g/g), and the grebe's age (juveniles, 5.5 +/- 0.8 mu g/g; adults, 8.4 +/- 1.0 mu g/g), but not by sex. Selenium concentrations in blood were correlated with selenium concentrations in the liver and with mercury concentrations in both blood and liver. Body mass of grebes increased dramatically from September (381 +/- 14 g wet wt) to November (591 +/- 11 g). Body, liver, and spleen mass either were not correlated with selenium or mercury concentrations or the relationship was positive. These results suggest that high mercury and selenium levels were not preventing grebes from increasing or maintaining mass.

J	Harlan, SS; Duebendorfer, EM; Deibert, JE				Harlan, SS; Duebendorfer, EM; Deibert, JE			New 40Ar/39Ar isotopic dates from Miocene volcanic rocks in the Lake Mead area and southern Las Vegas Range, Nevada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												New 40Ar/39Ar dates on volcanic rocks interlayered with synextensional Miocene sedimentary rocks in the western Lake Mend area and southern end of the Las Vegas Range provide tight constraints on magmatism, basin formation, and extensional deformation in the Basin and Range province of southern Nevada. Vertical axis rotations associated with movement along the Las Vegas Valley shear zone occurred after 15.67 +/- 0.10 Ma (2 sigma), based on a 40Ar/39Ar date from a tuff in the Gass Peak formation in the southern Las Vegas Range. Basaltic magmatism in the western Lake Mead area began as early as 13.28 +/- 0.09 Ma, based on a date from a basalt flow in the Lovell Wash Member of the Horse Spring Formation. Isotopic dating of a basalt from the Volcanic rocks of Callville Mesa indicates that these rocks are as old as 11.41 +/- 0.14 Ma, suggesting that volcanic activity began shortly after formation of the Boulder basin, the extensional basin in which the informally named red sandstone unit was deposited. The red sandstone unit is at least as old as 11.70 +/- 0.08 Ma and contains megabreccia deposits younger than 12.93 +/- 0.10 Ma. This result shows that formation of the Boulder basin was associated with development of topographic relief that was probably generated by movement along the Saddle Island low-angle normal fault. Stratal tilting associated with extension occurred both prior to and after 11.5 Ma.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAY	1998	35	5					495	503		10.1139/e98-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e98-008													WOS:000076343400001
J	Borcherding, J; Kiel, S; Struebig, A; Arndt, H				Borcherding, Jost; Kiel, Stephanie; Struebig, Anke; Arndt, Hartmut			Vertical migration of Daphnia galeata - Evidence for the use of an alternative resource from a lethal environment	LIMNOLOGICA												Metazoans normally avoid anaerobic environments, at least when they are combined with toxic stress due to hydrogen sulfide. In Lake Speldrop, a small but deep gravel pit lake at the Lower Rhine, Daphnia galeata was found not only to dominate the zooplankton community, but was also regularly found in anoxic and even sulfidic layers during summer. We conducted field experiments with a newly developed "Zoo-plankton In-situ Incubator", simulating vertical migrations of D. galeata. When daphnids were exposed to sulfidic conditions, mortality increased with exposure time, revealing LT50-values between 129 and 42 min in relation to increasing concentrations of sulfide. Additionally, those experimental individuals originating from 12.5 m depth showed significantly higher mortality rates than those from 7.5 m depth. Further migration experiments showed that an interruption period of sulfidic exposition in less stressful environments reduced mortality rates significantly. Daphnids found in the hypolimnion belonged partly to moribund parts of the population; however, the majority of daphnids showed regular mowing activity and was able to withstand sulfidic conditions in the hypolimnion for a limited time. It is so far unclear what maybe the major ultimate factor for this type of short term migratory behavior, to seek for shelter or to use high amounts of sulfur bacteria as an alternative food resource.

Three zones of distinct pollen, plant macrofossil, and chironomid assemblages are apparent in the sediment core from 3M Pond (informal name). A dry, sparsely vegetated spruce parkland and a warm-adapted chironomid community existed in and around the study sites in the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 C-14 yr BP). Between 7000 and 3500 C-14 Yr BP, Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forest conditions established and then declined around 3M Pond leading to modern subalpine parkland conditions from 3500 C-14 yr BP to present. Chironomid communities at 3M Pond between 7000 and 3500 C-14 yr BP are indicative of warmer waters than present, but show a transition to modern assemblages. Three climatic regimes are identified near Stoyoma Mountain: (1) the early Holocene xerothermic period (10,000 to 7000 C-14 yr BP, (2) a period of climatic transition in the mid-Holocene (7000 to 3500 C-14 yr BP), and (3) cool, modern neoglacial conditions (after 3500 C-14 yr BP). These findings confirm vegetation and inferred climate changes identified at Cabin Lake, British Columbia (a nearby lake in the subalpine forest). Changes in treeline position, plant communities, chironomid communities, and inferred climate are nearly synchronous and validate the multiproxy approach for paleoecological reconstruction Chironomid-based paleotemperature reconstructions confirm earlier evidence that the early Holocene was significantly warmer than present, with estimated summer water surface temperatures up to 4 degrees C higher than today.					; Pellatt, Marlow/L-5915-2019	MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X; Pellatt, Marlow/0000-0002-3925-461X													1523-0430					FEB	2000	32	1					73	83		10.2307/1552412	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552412													WOS:000085861000009

Assessment of Groundwater Quality and Vulnerability in the Nakivale Sub-Catchment of the Transboundary Lake Victoria Basin, Uganda	WATER												This study evaluates the quality and vulnerability of groundwater within the Nakivale Sub-catchment of the transboundary Lake Victoria Basin in Southwestern Uganda. Groundwater quality assessment focuses on its suitability for both drinking and agricultural uses. Hydrochemical analysis of 19 groundwater samples revealed that 90% comply with World Health Organization drinking water standards, although localized contamination was noted, particularly in terms of total iron, nitrate, potassium, magnesium, and sulfates. The drinking groundwater quality index shows that over 90% of the samples fall within the good-to-excellent quality categories. Elevated nitrate levels and chloride-bromide ratios indicate human impacts, likely due to agricultural runoff and wastewater disposal. For irrigation, Sodium Adsorption Ratio analysis revealed medium-to-high salinity hazards in the region, while Sodium Percentage and other parameters indicated low-to-moderate risks of soil degradation. DRASTIC vulnerability assessments identified low contamination risks due to impermeable geological layers, steep terrain, slow groundwater recharge, deep aquifer depth, and clayey soil cover. These findings emphasize the need for conjunctive water resource management, including improved groundwater quality monitoring, public education on sustainable practices, and protective measures for recharge zones and areas highly susceptible to contamination. By addressing these issues, this study aims to preserve groundwater resources for domestic and agricultural use, ensuring long-term sustainability in the region.

Determining the long-term natural rainfall variability in this region is essential for understanding the regional hydroclimatic response to external climate forcings and for contextualizing future hydroclimate changes. The Dead Sea (DS), located in the southern Levant, is a closed-basin lake whose size varies as a function of water availability. Reconstructing DS lake-level variations through time provides a quantitative measure of the natural hydroclimate variability and can inform on the local hydroclimate response to changes in global climate. Here, we constructed an updated lake-level history of the Holocene DS by: 1) studying lake high-stands derived from a series of new cores collected in the DS southern basin, 2) re-dating of the two major Holocene high-stand exposures, and 3) compiling all previously published ages of Holocene DS lake-level markers (n = 296 radiocarbon ages). The results show that the early (10-6.1 kyr cal BP) and late Holocene (3.6-0 kyr cal BP) in the DS were predominantly wet albeit punctuated by dry intervals, whereas the middle Holocene (6.1-3.6 kyr cal BP) was most likely relatively dry. This pattern of two Holocene humid intervals is also evident in distillation records derived from Levant speleothem caves (which represent the integrated magnitude of rainout from the vapor source to the caves), indicating that rainfall intensity and total water availability were correlated throughout the Holocene. These two humid intervals occurred during high and low summer insolation conditions, suggesting that they were modulated by different climatic mechanisms. The predicted future drying in the Levant is of similar magnitude to the natural hydroclimate variability and thus, it is crucial to assess whether the anthropogenic drying is inor out-of phase with the natural climate variability.

The growth and development of spinicaudata populations in freshwater environments depend on various physical, chemical, and biological factors. The action of volcanism modifies the limnological parameters in the process of fossilization of lacustrine deposits. This study identifies spinicaudatan assemblages in two Triassic lake systems in Argentina, and analyzes the dynamics of shell preservation according to the volcanic activity involved. Two taphonomic grades divided into three different second taphonomic grades were defined. The focus on taphonomic and chemistry studies addresses changes in spinicaudata abundance and richness through time, in different paleoenvironmental conditions, and shell preservation and chemical composition. The discussion highlights the importance of lava flow inflow and volcanic ash fall in the different lake systems. We emphasize the importance of taphonomic studies on the spinicaudata groups to understand their autochthonous and allochthonous populations in Triassic lake systems. In turn, we conclude that the post mortem processes experienced by the shells, the exposure time at the water-sediment interface, and the chemical alteration of the water into the paleolakes produced by the surrounding volcanic activity can explain the development and preservation of spinicaudata in these two Triassic lacustrine systems.

These stadial and interstadial events are expressed in marine and terrestrial high resolution records elsewhere in the world, but the magnitude and mode of the regional climate changes are still poorly quantified. Here we present new replicated stalagmite delta O-18 profiles from two caves in central Japan, which extend back to 83.4 ka. The records clearly display the H7 to H3 events, but not D-O cycles. An important feature of the two Japanese stalagmites is the small difference (similar to 2.9 parts per thousand) in delta O-18 values between the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Long-term trends of the stalagmite delta O-18 values at the more maritime site generally follow that of the delta O-18 record of seawater, which is responsible for similar to 1.1 parts per thousand of the similar to 2.9 parts per thousand difference between mid-Holocene and LGM. The remaining 1.8 parts per thousand in the difference can be accounted for by +9 degrees C of warming between the LGM and mid-Holocene and -3 degrees C cooling at H events, which are comparable with the previous estimates of land paleotemperature in the Japanese Islands. The attenuated isotopic signal associated with D-O interstadials indicates that the warming in the Atlantic did not significantly transfer to the maritime Japan. These unique features of the isotopic records of the Japanese stalagmites are due to the geographic position at the vicinity of the moisture source, Kuroshio warm current. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Paerl, HW; Priscu, JC				Paerl, HW; Priscu, JC			Microbial phototrophic, heterotrophic, and diazotrophic activities associated with aggregates in the permanent ice cover of Lake Bonney, Antarctica	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, Antarctica, one of the Earth's southernmost ecosystems containing liquid water, harbor some of the most environmentally extreme (cold, nutrient-deprived) conditions on the planet. Lake Bonney has a permanent ice cover that supports a unique microbial habitat, provided by soil particles blown onto the lake surface from the surrounding, ice-free valley floor. During continuous sunlight summers (Nov.-Feb.), the dark soil particles are heated by solar radiation and melt their way into the ice matrix. Layers and parches of aggregates and liquid water are formed. Aggregates contain a complex cyanobacterial-bacterial community, concurrently conducting photosynthesis (CO2 fixation), nitrogen (N-2) fixation, decomposition, and biogeochemical zonation needed to complete essential nutrient cycles. Aggregate-associated CO2- and N-2-fixation rates were low and confined to liquid water (i.e., no detectable activities in the ice phase). CO2 fixation was mediated by cyanobacteria; both cyanobacteria and eubacteria appeared responsible for N-2 fixation. CO2 fixation was stimulated primarily by nitrogen (NO3-), but also by phosphorus (PO43-). PO43- and iron (FeCl3 + EDTA) enrichment stimulated of N-2 fixation. Microautoradiographic and physiological studies indicate a morphologically and metabolically diverse microbial community, exhibiting different cell-specific photosynthetic and heterotrophic activities. The microbial community is involved in physical (particle aggregation) and chemical (establishing redox gradients) modification of a nutrient- and organic matter-enriched microbial "oasis," embedded in the desertlike (i.e., nutrient depleted) lake ice cover. Aggregate-associated production and nutrient cycling represent microbial self-sustenance in a microenvironment supporting "life at the edge," as it is known on Earth.

J	Madon, SP				Madon, SP			Low-effort regression estimation of daily ration in young walleye, Stizostedion vitreum	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												I used a low-effort regression approach to estimate daily rations of pond-reared age 0 walleye, Stizostedion vitreum (16.0-37.2 mm total length). The regression model predicted average 24-h food mass ((F) over bar(24)) from two or three consecutive point estimates of food mass (F-t) in fish guts taken at a sampling interval of 3 h. Predicted F, values were multiplied by gastric evacuation rates and by 24 h to yield daily ration estimates. Accuracy tests of the low-effort regression model for age 0 walleye based on resampling revealed that 93-100% of predicted (F) over bar(24) values fell within 2 SEs of observed (F) over bar(24) values determined from nine fish collections over 24 h. The age 0 walleye regression model provided estimates of daily ration that were within the 95% confidence intervals around observed daily ration values for conspecifics in an independent test pond (this study) and in other distinct pond systems. The age 0 walleye regression model also provided estimates of daily ration that were within the 95% confidence intervals around five out of seven observed daily ration values for age 0 lake yellow perch, Perca flavescens, also a diurnal feeder like walleye. The model reliably provided estimates of daily ration for fish that were 1.5-4.5 times the mean wet weight of the largest fish included in the model's domain.																			0706-652X					SEP	1998	55	9					2058	2066		10.1139/cjfas-55-9-2058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-9-2058													WOS:000077001400007

Understanding caldera degassing from a detailed investigation at Lake Rotoiti, Okataina Volcanic Centre, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Volcanic lakes in large silicic caldera volcanoes are an important source of CO2 emissions. However, quantifying CO2 output is challenging due to the lack of observed historical CO2 flux records and the large size of the volcanic and hydrothermal systems. Twenty percent of the surface area of Okataina Caldera, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand is covered with lakes. Geothermal expressions, predominantly on the Okataina caldera margin, occur in at least six different locations, with surface expressions both on land and under water. Lake Rotoiti is located at the northwest edge of the Okataina Caldera, spans across the Tikitere and Taheke geothermal fields, and has inputs from on-land thermal springs, lake floor hydrothermal vents, and from Lake Rotorua. CO2 flux from Lake Rotoiti was assessed using the accumulation chamber method and three techniques are used to process the data for total CO2 emission of the lake: (1) sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) method allows quantification of CO2 emission with spatial control, (2) graphical statistical approach (GSA) allows the quantification of CO2 emission from different degassing regimes, and (3) a method based on water chemistry of the lake. We find CO2 is mostly emitting at Tumoana Bay and Central Basin, and the emission rate is 271 +/- 38 t d-1 of CO2 (based on sGs). We then added this estimated emission data to the existing CO2 data for individual geothermal systems distributed around the active Okataina volcanic centre and calculate that the entire caldera is emitting at least 1856 t d-1 of CO2. The total emission is dominated by the lakes, where the topography is lower. We discuss the implications of this study in terms of preferential degassing locations and the amount of degassing, in particular for CO2, in an active caldera setting.

A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Lowest Effective Dose of Acetazolamide for Acute Mountain Sickness Prevention	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE												BACKGROUND: Acetazolamide is the most common medication used for acute mountain sickness prevention, with speculation that a reduced dose may be as efficacious as standard dosing with fewer side effects. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial compared acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily to the standard dose acetazolamide 125 mg twice daily starting the evening prior to ascent from 1240 m (4100 ft) to 3810 m (12,570 ft) over 4 hours. The primary outcome was acute mountain sickness incidence (ie, headache, Lake Louise Questionnaire >= 3, and another symptom). RESULTS: A total of 106 participants were analyzed, with 51 (48%) randomized to 125 mg and 55 (52%) to 62.5 mg, with a combined acute mountain sickness incidence of 53 (50%) and mean severity of 3 (+/- 2.1). The 62.5-mg group failed to fall within the prespecified 26% noninferiority margin for acute mountain sickness incidence (62.5 mg = 30 [55%] vs 125 mg = 23 [45%], 95% confidence interval [CI]-11% to 30%). Participants in the 62.5-mg group had a higher risk of acute mountain sickness (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% CI 0.7-3.2) and moderate acute mountain sickness (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% CI 0.6-5.9), with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 9, with a number needed to treat (NNT) in the 125-mg group of 4.8. Increased acute mountain sickness incidence and symptom severity corresponded to lower weight-based and body mass index dosing, with similar side effects between groups. CONCLUSION: Acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily failed to demonstrate equal effectiveness to 125 mg twice daily for prevention of acute mountain sickness. With increased risk and no demonstrable symptomatic or physiologic benefits, acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily should not be recommended for acute mountain sickness prevention. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Dressler, BO; Reimold, WU				Dressler, BO; Reimold, WU			Terrestrial impact melt rocks and glasses	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The effects of meteorite and comet impact on Earth are rock brecciation, the formation of shock metamorphic features, rock melting, and the formation of impact structures, i.e. simple craters, complex craters, and multi-ring basins. Large events, such as the 65-Ma Chicxulub impact, are believed to have had catastrophic environmental effects that profoundly influenced the development of life on Earth. In this review, an attempt is made to summarize some of the voluminous literature on impact melting, one important aspect of planetary impact, provide some comments on this process, and to make suggestions for future research. The products of impact melting are glasses, impact melt rocks, and pseudotachylites. Our treatise deals mainly with the geological setting, petrography, and major-element chemistry of melt rocks and glasses. Impact glasses, in several petrographic aspects, are similar to volcanic glasses, but they are associated with shock metamorphosed mineral and rock fragments and, in places, with siderophile element anomalies suggestive of meteoritic contamination. They are found in allogenic breccia deposits within (fall-back 'suevite') and outside (fall-out 'suevite') impact craters and, as spherules, in distal ejecta. Large events, such as the K/T boundary Chicxulub impact, are responsible for the formation of worldwide ejecta horizons which are associated with siderophile element anomalies and shock metamorphosed mineral and rock debris. Impact glasses have a bulk chemical composition that is homogeneous but exemptions to this rule are common. On a microscopic scale, however, impact glasses are commonly strikingly heterogeneous. Tektites are glasses ejected from craters over large distances. They are characterized by very low water and volatile contents and element abundances and ratios that are evidence that tektites formed by melting of upper crustal, sedimentary rocks. Four tektite strewn-fields are known, three of which can be tied to specific impact craters. Impact melt rocks form sheets, lenses, and dike-like bodies within or beneath allogenic fallback breccia deposits in the impact crater and possibly on crater terraces and flanks. Dikes of impact melt rocks also intrude the rocks of the crater floor. They commonly contain shock metamorphosed target rock and mineral fragments in various stages of assimilation and are glassy or fine- to coarse-grained. Chemically, they are strikingly homogeneous, but as with impact glasses, exemptions to this rule do exist. Large and thick melt bodies, such as the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC), are differentiated or may represent a combination of impact melt rocks sensu-strictu and impact-triggered, deep-crustal melts. A concerted, multidisciplinary approach to future research on impact melting and on other aspects of meteorite and comet impact is advocated. Impact models are models only and uncritical reliance on their validity will not lead to a better understanding of impact processes-especially of melting, excavation, and deposition of allogenic breccias and the spatial position of breccias in relation to sheets and lenses of melt rocks within the crater. Impact-triggered pressure-release melting of target rocks beneath the excavation cavity may be responsible for the existence of melt rocks beneath the impact melt rocks sensu-strictu. This controversial idea needs to be tested by a re-evaluation of existing data and models, be they based on field or laboratory research. Only a relatively small number of terrestrial impact structures has been investigated in sufficient detail as it relates to geological and geophysical mapping. In this review, we summarize observations made on impact melt rocks and impact glasses in a number of North American (Brent, Haughton, Manicouagan, New Quebec, Sudbury, Wanapitei, all in Canada), Asian (Popigai, Russia; Zhamanshin, Kazakhstan), two South African structures (Morokweng and Vredefort), the Henbury crater field of Australia, and one European crater (Ries, Germany). Our tables listing major-element chemical compositions of impact glasses and melt rocks, however, include also data from structures not dealt with in further detail. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Size-segregated aerosol measurements were made over consecutive 12-h periods with Micro-Orifice and Noll Rotary impacters (MOI and NRI), and depositing-particulate collections to aerodynamically smooth airfoils were made over periods of 3-4 days. The combination of the MOI and NRI provided size-segregated particulate samples in 12 discrete intervals between 0.059 and, nominally, 100 mu m. The samples were analyzed for As, Ca, Mg, Se, Sb, V, and Zn by instrumental neutron activation analysis and for S by X-ray-fluorescence. Aerosol and deposition data for individual elemental constituents were fit with a chemical mass balance deposition (CMBD) model in which a set of particle-size-specific deposition velocities (V-d), best reconciling the deposition data, were determined by iterative (constrained) solution of a series of six linear equations using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Under stable conditions and mean wind speed of 4.0 m s(-1), minimum V-d values for particles with physical diameters between 0.09 and 0.53 mu m averaged 0.006 +/- 0.005 cm s(-1), wherein uncertainties were determined by Monte Carlo analysis. This agrees favorably with Values determined by microscopy for which uncertainties were much larger and with those predicted by the Williams model for the same period. The results suggest that physically significant V-d values are obtainable from a constrained CMBD model.

Stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen have been sampled monthly in order to determine the spatial and temporal hydrological behavior and the mean residence time of water in the Vermigliana catchment, North-Eastern Italy. This study aims at separating contributions to streamflow originating from Presena and Presanella glaciers, both exerting a strong control on the hydrologic budget of the study site. The isotopic signature of precipitation has been collected at two locations at different altitudes (1176 m a.s.l. and 2731 m a.s.l.), while stream water was sampled at 11 locations, 8 along the main course of the Vermigliana creek and 3 along the two tributaries of the Vermigliana creek: the Presanella and Presena creeks. Groundwater was sampled monthly in a single location, whilst the waters of two small lakes, Capanna Presena and Cantiere, both located in the proximity of the Presena glacier, were sampled during summer, when the sites were accessible. Isotope analysis evidenced that Presena and Presanella creeks are the main contributors to the Vermigliana creek. The contribution of the Presanella creek is 44% of the total flow at the confluence with the Vermigliana, while the contribution of the Presena creek rises to 75% of the total flow immediately after the confluence. The mean residence times computed for the Vermigliana and the tributaries vary between 7 and 5 months, respectively. This work allows us to investigate the main components in the hydrological cycle of the Vermigliana catchment and constitutes the basis for future modeling and climate change impact studies on this important Alpine catchment. The methodology can be exported to other sites with the aim to provide additional data, with respect to streamflow at the catchment outlet, to reduce epistemic uncertainty of hydrological models.

Observed ozone concentrations and weather variables have been analyzed for the Lake Michigan region and the eastern United States for four 1991 LMOS ozone episodes covering 21 days. It is found that all LMOS episodes are associated with large polluted regions with dimensions of 1000-2000 km, located on the western side of high pressure systems centered over the eastern United States. Consequently, the air coming into the LMOS region contains significant amounts of ozone, haze, and other pollutants advected along trajectories with anticyclonic curvature originating in upwind source regions from St. Louis, through the Ohio River valley, and into the northeast megalopolis. The local sources in the Gary-Chicago-Milwaukee region then add to this already polluted air mass, where concentrations are influenced by the strong stability of the boundary layer over Lake Michigan and the associated lake-land-breeze circulations. However, the magnitudes of ozone concentrations in the LMOS region are often quickly and significantly reduced by rain and by fronts, which are present in some portion of the domain during nearly all of the days that were studied. The portion of the urban ozone plume that is not influenced by rain and fronts is observed to be advected into rural areas at downwind distances of 100-200 km or more from Chicago, and often has concentrations higher than those in Chicago. Whether maximum concentrations are located on the western or the eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan depends on whether winds have an easterly or westerly component.																			0894-8763					MAR	1995	34	3					670	678		10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<0670:RBMAOI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<0670:RBMAOI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995QK45200007

Effects of water level and climate on the hydrodynamics and water quality of Anvil Lake, Wisconsin, a shallow seepage lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Robertson DM, Juckem PF, Dantoin ED, Winslow LA. 2018. Effects of water level and climate on the hydrodynamics and water quality of Anvil Lake, Wisconsin, a shallow seepage lake. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:00-00.Interannual differences in the water quality of Anvil Lake, Wisconsin, were examined to determine how water level and climate affect the hydrodynamics and trophic state of shallow lakes, and their importance compared to anthropogenic changes in the watershed. Anvil Lake is a relatively pristine seepage lake with hydrology dominated by precipitation, evaporation, and groundwater exchange enabling the typically subtle effects of water level and climate to be evaluated. Groundwater and hydrodynamic models were used to describe lake water and phosphorus budgets and how its hydrodynamics are affected by water level and air temperature. Decreases in water level are expected to cause Anvil Lake and other shallow lakes to stratify fewer days, and have warmer bottom temperatures and more deep-mixing events. Increasing air temperatures should cause these lakes to have shorter ice cover, longer summer stratification periods, and warmer bottom temperatures. How water level affects water quality depends on how nutrient loading and lake volume vary: during drier, low-water years, lakes with large interannual changes in loading should have better water quality, whereas lakes with small changes in loading should degrade slightly. Anthropogenic changes in Anvil Lake's watershed over the past approximate to 100yr were about 1.5times the effects of changes in water level when levels were low, but the effects were similar when levels were high. Climate warming is expected to increase productivity in shallow lakes because warmer air temperatures will likely increase bottom temperatures increasing sediment phosphorus release and deep-mixing events enabling this phosphorus to reach the epilimnion.					; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018	Dantoin, Eric/0000-0002-8561-2924; Juckem, Paul/0000-0002-3613-1761; Winslow, Luke/0000-0002-8602-5510; Robertson, Dale/0000-0001-6799-0596													1040-2381	2151-5530					2018	34	3					211	231		10.1080/10402381.2017.1412374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1412374													WOS:000445258100001
J	Haight, RG; Mladenoff, DJ; Wydeven, AP				Haight, RG; Mladenoff, DJ; Wydeven, AP			Modeling disjunct gray wolf populations in semi-wild landscapes	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Gray wolves (Canis lupus) in parts of the United States and Europe live in networks of disjunct populations, many of which are close to human settlement. Because wolf management goals include sustaining disjunct populations, it is important to ask what types of areas and protections are needed for population survival. To predict the effects of different levels of human-caused mortality, we created a simulation model for a disjunct wolf population living in a semi-wild landscape with abundant, well distributed prey. The landscape included a maximum of 16 territories divided into core and peripheral range. The mortality rate in the core range was 20%, whereas the mortality rate in peripheral range (40%) was higher because of human-caused deaths. We examined the relationship between the proportions of core and peripheral range and the 50-year occupancy of that range by wolf packs, given different assumptions about pup and dispersal mortality and immigration. Simulations showed that occupancy increased as the number of core sites increased, but curve location depended on parameter assumptions. With pup and dispersal mortality rates consistent with those for disease-free and legally protected populations, wolves saturated a 16-territory cluster with as few as two core sites, regardless of immigration rate. When populations had high pup or dispersal mortality, as few as two immigrants per year helped maintain high (>80%) site occupancy in clusters with four or more core sites. Small numbers of immigrants were also important for sustaining colonizing populations and buffering the negative effects of increased environmental variation. The simulations supported the claim that wolves can survive in disjunct populations provided that wolves can move between populations, human persecution is not excessive, and prey is abundant.																			0888-8892					AUG	1998	12	4					879	888		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97103.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97103.x													WOS:000075179800020
J	Claassen, VP; Hogan, MP				Claassen, VP; Hogan, MP			Soil nitrogen pools associated with revegetation of disturbed sites in the Lake Tahoe area	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Thin, poorly developed soils in the high elevation, summer-dry environment near Lake Tahoe, California are easily disturbed by anthropogenic impacts. Subsoils and parent materials that are exposed by vegetation removal and topsoil erosion or by burial during construction activities are difficult to revegetate and may continue to erode for decades after disturbance. The resulting sediment loads contribute to decreased water quality in local watersheds and to the loss of clarity in Lake Tahoe. Field observations suggest that soil disturbance often results in depletion of soil nitrogen (N) reserves and that the remaining substrates may be unable to provide adequate N for revegetation. To quantify the levels of soil N that are associated with higher levels of percent plant cover on previously disturbed soils in the Lake Tahoe area, a basin-wide survey and a second paired site study were conducted. Results indicate that extractable ammonium and nitrate levels correlate poorly with percent vegetative cover, whereas the correlations of anaerobically mineralizable N and total N are stronger and account for nearly 50% of the variability in plant cover data. Sites with plant cover measuring greater than 40% are associated with total soil N levels of about 1,200 kg N/ha and anaerobic mineralizable N levels of about 26 kg N/ha. Despite high concentrations of N in the surface soils, a large fraction of the N in the 0- to 50-cm profile occurs below 30 cm, when measured on a landscape basis.																			1061-2971					JUN	2002	10	2					195	203		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.00228.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.00228.x													WOS:000175832600003
J	Arbogast, AF; Loope, WL				Arbogast, AF; Loope, WL			Maximum-limiting ages of Lake Michigan coastal dunes: their correlation with holocene lake level history	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coastal geomorphology along the Great Lakes has long been linked with lake-level history. Some of the most spectacular landforms along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan are high-relief dunes that mantle take terraces. It has been assumed that these dunes developed during the Nipissing high stand of ancestral Lake Michigan. This hypothesis was tested through stratigraphic analyses and radiocarbon dating of buried soils at four sites between Manistee and Grand Haven, Michigan. At each site, thick deposits of eolian sand overlie tate-Pleistocene lacustrine sands. Moderately developed Spodosols (Entic Haplorthods) formed in the uppermost part of the lake sediments are buried by thick dune sand at three sites. At the fourth locality, a similar soil occurs in a very thin (1.3 m) unit of eolian sand buried deep within a dune. These soils indicate long-term (similar to 4,000 years) stability of the lake deposits following subaerial exposure. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal in the buried sola indicates massive dune construction began between 4,900 and 4,500 cal. yr B.P. at the Nordhouse Dunes site, between 4,300 and 3,900 cal. yr B.P. at the Jackson and Nugent Quarries, and between 3,300 to 2,900 cat. yr B.P. at Rosy Mound. Given these ages, it can be concluded that dune building at one site occurred during the Nipissing high stand but that the other dunes developed later Although lake levels generally fell after the Nipissing, it appears that dune construction may have resulted from small increases in lake level and destabilization of lake-terrace bluffs.																			0380-1330						1999	25	2					372	382		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70746-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70746-X													WOS:000081807600015
J	Fac-Beneda, J				Fac-Beneda, Joanna			Fractal structure of the Kashubian hydrographic system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The research included seven drainage basins comprising of 30 sub-basins of the Kashubian hydrographic system (ksh), part of the Pomeranian Lake District in northern Poland. In the study maps of 1:50000 scale were used. The river network is developing according to the Horton's laws. The network as identified with the method of hydrographic interpretation, while its ordering was based on the methods of Horton-Strahler (Horton, 1945) and of Drwal (Drwal, 1982). The fractal dimension was calculated by two methods: one of them is based on the bifurcation ratio and the stream length ratio and is called geomorphic fractal dimension, and second method to estimate the fractal dimension of river networks is functional box counting (is called raster fractal dimension). Ordering of a network by the results of the Drwal method means reducing the bifurcation ratio (R-b) and the average length ratio (R-I) values in comparison with the analogous values obtained with the Horton-Strahler method. In the network analysis more reliable results were obtained by using Drwal's method, as the values of the geomorphic fractal dimension obtained with the Horton-Strahler method do not always fall within the range specified for the fractal dimension, e.g. between 1 and 2. However, in the box-counting method (raster dimension) it is important to adopt as short measurement lines as possible or as many measurement line sections as possible, and not only two. The ksh river network is still in the organization stage. Its most mature stage is represented by the network of the catchments A2 (D = 1.89), C3 (D = 1.97) and D (D = 1.97) on the northern slope and the network G (D = 1.79) on the southern slope.

J	Haukos, DA; Smith, LM				Haukos, DA; Smith, LM			Effects of soil water on seed production and photosynthesis of pink smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum L.) in playa wetlands	WETLANDS												Soil moisture is frequently manipulated by wetland managers to achieve a desired composition and production of plant species. Pink smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum) is a species valued by wetland managers because of its potential seed production and food base for migrating and wintering waterbirds. To improve ability to manage pink smartweed, we measured the influence of four growing-season soil moisture regimes (flooded, field capacity, prescribed moist-soil management, and continuously dry) in playa wetlands of the Southern High Plains of Texas. We used xylem water potential as an index of soil moisture available to the plants and compared vegetation and seed production among the four moisture treatments. Daily net photosynthesis was measured in each playa at 0900, 1200, and 1700 hours. The continuously-flooded wetland had the lowest absolute xylem water potential value (-0.294 MPa), followed by the playa at field capacity (-0.446 MPa), moist-soil managed playa (-0.758 MPa), and dry playa (-1.039 MPa). Vegetation biomass (F-3.40 = 97.7, P < 0.001) and seed production (F-3.40 = 54.3, P < 0.001) of pink smartweed differed among soil moisture treatments. Conducting moist-soil management ((x) over bar = 6816 kg[ha) increased vegetation biomass by 44% over the dry treatment ((x) over bar = 4706 kg/ha). As soil moisture increased to field capacity (9 = 9010 kg[ha) vegetation increased by 32% above the moist-soil treatment. Maintaining standing water in a playa maximized vegetation production ((x) over bar = 12497 kg/ha) of pink smartweed. Seed production was greatest when soil moisture was maintained at field capacity ((x) over bar = 695 kg/ha). There was no difference in seed production between the moist-soil managed ((x) over bar = 492 kg/ha) and flooded playas ((x) over bar = 514 kg/ha), which was 28% lower than the field capacity treatment. Seed production in the dry treatment ((x) over bar = 377 kg/ha) was 46% lower than the field capacity treatment and 25% below the flooded and moist-soil managed treatments. Net photosynthesis and xylem water potential decreased throughout the day in all treatments except continuously flooded, which corresponded to the increased vegetation production in this treatment. Slight increases in water stress relative to the continuously flooded treatment resulted in a redistribution of resources from vegetation to seed production. Managers should consider maintaining wetland soils at field capacity to increase seed production of pink smartweed.																			0277-5212					MAR	2006	26	1					265	270		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[265:EOSWOS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[265:EOSWOS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236603100023

Marine Isotope Stage 11 occurred from 425 to 394 ka, when global ice volume was the lowest, sea level was the highest, and terrestrial temperatures were the warmest of the last 500 kyr. Because of its extreme character, this interval has been considered an analog for the next century of climate change. The Bering Sea is ideally situated to record how opening or closing of the Pacific-Arctic Ocean gateway (Bering Strait) impacted primary productivity, sea ice, and sediment transport in the past; however, little is known about this region prior to 125 ka. IODP Expedition 323 to the Bering Sea offered the unparalleled opportunity to look in detail at time periods older than had been previously retrieved using gravity and piston cores. Here we present a multi-proxy record for Marine Isotope Stages 12 to 10 from Site U1345, located near the continental shelf-slope break. MIS 11 is bracketed by highly productive laminated intervals that may have been triggered by flooding of the Beringian shelf. Although sea ice is reduced during the early MIS 11 laminations, it remains present at the site throughout both glacials and MIS 11. High summer insolation is associated with higher productivity but colder sea surface temperatures, which implies that productivity was likely driven by increased upwelling. Multiple examples of Pacific-Atlantic teleconnections are presented including laminations deposited at the end of MIS 11 in synchrony with millennial-scale expansions in sea ice in the Bering Sea and stadial events seen in the North Atlantic. When global eustatic sea level was at its peak, a series of anomalous conditions are seen at U1345. We examine whether this is evidence for a reversal of Bering Strait throughflow, an advance of Beringian tidewater glaciers, or a turbidite.					; Colmenero-Hidalgo, Elena/I-1634-2015; Caissie, Beth/HKO-7944-2023	Cook, Mea/0000-0003-3786-6353; Colmenero-Hidalgo, Elena/0000-0002-5449-2739; Caissie, Beth/0000-0001-9587-1842													1814-9324	1814-9332				SEP 1	2016	12	9					1739	1763		10.5194/cp-12-1739-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1739-2016													WOS:000383889000001
J	Carlson, AE; Mickelson, DM; Principat, SM; Chapel, DM				Carlson, AE; Mickelson, DM; Principat, SM; Chapel, DM			The genesis of the northern Kettle Moraine, Wisconsin	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Interpreting past glacial dynamics from the glacial record requires that the depositional environments of glacial sediments and landforms be understood. In the case of interlobate deposits, models that incorporate various components of pro, supra and subglacial deposition have been developed and tested in the northern Kettle Moraine (nKM), Wisconsin; a large interlobate deposit that formed between the Green Bay and Lake Michigan lobes of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation. In this paper, we interpret a new genesis for the nKM using sediment analysis and distribution along with landform distribution. In Sheboygan County, the nKM consists of two steep-sided, high-relief, hummocky ridges separated by a low elevation and low-relief central axis. Gravel in the bounding hummocky ridges is well-sorted and well-rounded. Some bedding is collapsed. Large, isolated moulin kames are restricted to the axis area and composed of relatively poorly sorted, more angular gravel and diamicton. The distribution of these different sediments and landforms are explained by the accumulation of supraglacial debris that insulated the ice below the axis of the nKM, while the melting of cleaner ice on either side formed channels on the ice surface. As deglaciation proceeded, a substantial thickness of well-rounded, stream-deposited sand and gravel accumulated on ice in the bounding channels. Eventual collapse of this sediment formed the two hummocky ridges. Poorly sorted debris along the axis fell and slid into moulins and larger collapse areas in the ice. Thus, differential debris insulation and ice ablation controlled the mainly supraglacial deposition of this part of the nKM. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Scott; Martin, Kathy; O'Donoghue, Mark; Turkington, Roy			Trophic Dynamics of the Boreal Forests of the Kluane Region	ARCTIC												The trophic dynamics of the Yukon boreal forest have been under investigation at the Kluane Lake Research Station since 1973. We monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). The central problem has been to determine the causes of the 9-10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. The hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. Predators also cause stress in female hares, and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. Many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fluctuate with the hare cycle. Arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. Small rodents fluctuate in numbers in two patterns. Red-backed voles and four species of Microtus voles have a 3-4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. Deer mice, in contrast, have fluctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. White spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. Global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. It will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations. We recommend continued monitoring of the major species in these boreal forests.

Forest cover and deforestation patterns in the Northern Andes (Lake Maracaibo Basin): A synoptic assessment using MODIS and Landsat imagery	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This work synthesizes results from the application of land cover classification techniques and probability sampling of satellite imagery for estimating forest extent and deforestation in Lake Maracaibo Basin (Venezuela and Colombia). A forest map was produced using a semi-automated supervised classification routine on MODIS 8-day 500-m imagery acquired in January 2010. Results show that forests occupy 29,710 km(2) which represents 38% of the basin's total terrestrial landmass. From this extent, 61% belongs to Venezuela and 39% falls within the Colombian region. Findings indicate a drastic decrease in forest cover as a result of anthropogenic agricultural and urban expansion, especially when compared to its potential extent within the 'Maracaibo dry forests' and the 'Venezuelan Andean montane forests' ecoregions. Using time series of Landsat imagery, deforestation rates for the 1985-2010 time period were calculated. The analysis was performed on 24 samples blocks of 10 x 10 km(2) randomly allocated within previously defined change probability strata. The general spatial distribution of deforestation rates was predicted by a simple regression model between sample blocks and prior change probabilities at the basin scale. Our results indicate that deforestation was low (<0.5%/y) in 85% of the basin, with highly focalized deforestation fronts (intermediate-to-high rates, <2.5%/y) in three regions: a) the Motatan river sub-basin in the Eastern Cordillera, b) the lower slopes of the Catatumbo river sub-basin and c) the submontane regions of the Apon and Santa Ana river sub-basins. The results of this paper lead the way for understanding current patterns in socioeconomic drivers of forest clearing in Lake Maracaibo Basin. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of using alternatives methods to the time-consuming and financially unsustainable methods traditionally used at national and sub-national scale in Venezuela and other Latin American countries.

Biology and Life History of Paddlefish in North America: An Update	PADDLEFISH MANAGEMENT, PROPAGATION, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY: BUILDING FROM 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Paddlefish Conservation and Management	DEC 05, 2006	Omaha, NE	Amer Fisheries Soc				Paddlefish Polyodon spathula are among the largest and longest lived of the freshwater fishes (e.g., more than 2.2 m long; 72 kg; 30 years old) and can be distinguished by the presence of a large mouth and a long, paddle-shaped snout. Smooth skin, small eyes, a large, tapering operculum flap, bluish-gray to black coloration dorsally, and a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin all serve to distinguish paddlefish from other species. Paddlefish become sexually mature and spawn at a later age than many other freshwater fishes; males mature at an earlier age than females, but maturity varies by latitude. Male paddlefish typically spawn each year, but spawning periodicity may be variable for females. Paddlefish spawn over gravel or other hard surfaces and require specific photoperiod, water temperature, and water flow for successful spawning. Paddlefish are relatively fecund (9,000-26,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight); mature eggs range from about 2.0-4.0 mm in diameter, and time from egg fertilization to hatching is directly related to water temperature. Optimum temperature for hatching is about 18 degrees C. Newly hatched larvae average about 8.5 mm total length (TL) and are passive drifters until they are about 17 mm long when the yolk sac has been absorbed and the larvae begin active feeding on zooplankton and insects. Paddlefish complete fin ray development at 145-160 mm TL; at this size, they are considered juveniles and are similar in appearance to adults. Few paddlefish reach the maximum known age; instead, the median age for most populations is 5-8 years and maximum age is 14-18 years. Paddlefish growth seems to be directly related to the length of the growing season and food abundance. Generally, paddlefish length increases rapidly for about the first 5 years. After 5 years, paddlefish weight increases rapidly and may double during this time. Paddlefish feed primarily on zooplankton but occasionally consume small insects, insect larvae, and small fish. Traditionally, paddlefish inhabited slow-moving waters of side channels and river-lakes. In regulated rivers, paddlefish congregate where current velocities are reduced. In large rivers, paddlefish tend to congregate in the deep waters, usually selecting areas with depths greater than 3 m and current velocities less than 0.5 m/s. Further, paddlefish are highly mobile and make extensive movements within a system. Most of this movement is random, but paddlefish also make extensive nonrandom movements in spring during upstream migration to spawning areas. Some aspects of paddlefish life history and biology make them highly vulnerable to human activities. High prices for paddlefish roe or flesh periodically have stimulated fishing pressure and overexploitation followed by rapid declines in some populations. Dredging, flow manipulation, and the construction of dams have altered much of the traditional paddlefish habitat. Increasing levels of recreational and commercial boat traffic may also contribute to the mortality of paddlefish. Understanding and considering paddlefish biology and ecology can contribute to scientifically sound stewardship of all paddlefish populations, whether management is for conserving healthy populations or restoring decimated stocks.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-12-7				2009	66						1	+																WOS:000278471300001

The experiments were run for 30 days during the summers of 1991-1992 and 1992-1993, and for 48 days in 1993-1994. When WE radiation was allowed to enter into the mesocosms (full sun), the population of Ankyra judayi (Chlorophyta) reached the highest density, suggesting that this species can endure high levels of UV radiation. Concurrently, an increase in chlorophyll a concentration was observed in this treatment. The cladoceran Chydorus sphaericus and the rotifer Lepadella ovalis were strongly inhibited by UVB. Conversely, UVB radiation had no effect on the survival of the different life stages of the calanoid copepod Boeckella gracilipes, suggesting a species-specific difference in the sensitivity to solar UVB radiation. Moreover, no reduction in the number of copepod eggs per female and the number of nauplii produced was observed. Apparently, herbivory does not strongly affect phytoplankton abundance. Moreover, the phytoplankton species composition changed in the different treatments over the time. Fuagilaria construens and Fragilaria crotonensis were dominant in those mesocosms where UVB was excluded. Populations fluctuated depending on their life cycles and the period of time they were exposed to UVB radiation. It is important to define the time scale of exclusion experiments, because different conclusions about the influence of UVB irradiance result from short-, medium-or long-term exposures.

To advance understanding their sedimentary architecture and depositional processes, a large-scale sublacustrine fan system in the Eocene Weixinan Depression, northern South China Sea has been identified and investigated through the comprehensive analysis of 3-D seismic, well-logging, and core data. This fan was deposited during a lake-level falling stage, covering an area of 55 Km(2). It can be divided into two sections in the vertical direction by the sedimentary characteristics. The lower section mainly consists of thin layers of well-sorted fine sandstones with parallel bedding, which are interpreted as deposits of turbidity currents. By contrast, the upper section comprises thick layers of gravelly coarse sandstones with various deformation structures and widespread floating clasts, which should be the deposits of cohesive debris flows. Provenance analysis suggests that the development of complicated sedimentary characteristics has a close relationship with the occurrence of multiple sediment supply directions. The lower section was sourced by the western delta with long-distance transported well-sorted sediments, while the northern fan delta sourced the upper section with short-distance transported coarse-grained sediments. Its depositional process was mainly controlled by paleo-geomorphology, sediment supply, and relative lake level changes. The lower section, controlled by the flexure slope belt, is a typical sand-rich sublacustrine fan characterized by the low gradient (<1 degrees-1.5 degrees), while the upper section, controlled by the steep slope fault belt, is a gravel-rich sublacustrine fan dominated by intense faulting and high gradient (3.2 degrees-4.5 degrees). In addition, during the depositional period of the upper section, the relay ramps between en-echelon faults provided major entry points for coarse-grained sedimentary flows into the depression. Therefore, a deep-lacustrine model is proposed for the sublacustrine fan system, showing the detailed "triggering-transportation-deposition" process. This study outlines the complexity of the sedimentary architecture of sublacustrine fans in structurally active settings, and the proposed model may be applicable in other lacustrine basins.					liu, Xiangfeng/GYA-0553-2022; CHEN, SI/B-4824-2013; Pan, Songqi/A-5919-2015	CHEN, SI/0000-0002-0305-8641; 													0264-8172	1873-4073				DEC	2021	134								105380	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105380		OCT 2021											WOS:000712118900001

Our results were compared with those from temperate habitats. Mean egg development period of laboratory females (11 d) was 2-4 d longer than for temperate populations but mean fecundity (laboratory = 3.91; field = 2.48) was comparable. Birth rates of field females were low (0.01-0.06 per capita/d and 0.07-0.25 per mature female/d) with lowest rates during the summer when water temperatures were 25-34-degrees-C. Annual mean density, mean standing stock, and annual production estimates from Lake Thonotosassa (12,354/m2, 2.46 g/m2, and 26.9 g m-2 yr-1) were markedly higher than those seen in temperate studies. However, among-site variation in Lake Thonotosassa was large. Our annual production: biomass ratio (P/BBAR) was 10.9 and exceeded that of temperate populations, but cohort P/BBAR was 3.9 and comparable. The Lake Thonotosassa population of H. azteca was multivoltine with a cohort CPI of 129 d whereas temperate populations usually are univoltine with CPI intervals > 365 d. Subtropical temperature regimens, continuous reproduction and recruitment of amphipods, and year-around abundance of Typha and associated epiphytic algal communities appear to be the factors responsible for high densities and production in this subtropical lake.																			0887-3593					MAR	1992	11	1					69	79		10.2307/1467883	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467883													WOS:A1992HJ00200007
J	Cooke, SJ; McKinley, RS; Philipp, DP				Cooke, SJ; McKinley, RS; Philipp, DP			Physical activity and behavior of a centrarchid fish, Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede), during spawning	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The spawning behavior of male and female largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede) was studied in central Illinois during the spring of 1998 to examine patterns of muscular activity associated with different spawning related behaviors and to evaluate whether electromyogram (EMGi) telemetry could be used to detect spawning activity. Fish were implanted with EMGi transmitters (8 females, 16 males) on April 7, prior to the initiation of spawning, and were released in four 0.10-ha earthen research ponds. Continuous EMGi records, underwater video-graphy and additional visual observations for one pair of EMGi tagged fish were collected throughout the entire spawning event, allowing us to quantify behavioral correlates of physical activity. Male EMGi activity patterns were only correlated with female patterns during courting and periods of male aggression toward the female. Overall, EMGi activity was highest for the female during shuddering (gamete deposition), whereas male EMGi activity was similarly high during periods of nest excavation, shuddering and post-spawn parental care activities. During spawning, female EMGi activity was positively correlated to shuddering. Average daily EMGi activities for females peaked on the day of spawning. As a result of their engagement in parental care activities, male activity continued to rise even after spawning was completed. EMGi telemetry appears to be a useful technique for monitoring the reproductive activity of largemouth bass, especially in areas of high cover or turbid water or during low light conditions. This technology permitted us to quantify and contrast the activity patterns associated with different spawning related activities, information that will be required to construct accurate, gender-specific bioenergetics models for this species.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2001	10	4					227	237		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100405.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100405.x													WOS:000173979100005

Several studies enlighten the environmental changes in the CE caused by anthropogenic activities. In the present study, an attempt has been made to quantify the heavy metal (dissolved and particulate) fluxes brought by the six rivers into the CE with their exchange into the coastal ocean through the major inlet at Cochin during a steady flow period (October-November 2015). The water flux across the inlet was quantified using an acoustic doppler current profiler. The measured daily input of dissolved metals from the rivers was 2.43 x 10(3) kg Fe, 334 kg Zn, 259 kg Ni, and 83 kg Cr, while that of particulate metals were 85.30 x 10(3) kg Fe, 8. 6 x 10(3) kg Mn, 236.9 kg Cr, and 111.9 kg Zn. The net export of metals through the Cochin inlet (per tidal cycle) was 3.3 x 10(3) kg Fe, 515 kg Cr, 150 kg Zn, and 5 kg Ni in dissolved form and 3.32 x 10(5) kg Fe, 1747 kg Mn, 1636 kg Cr, 1397 kg Zn, and 586 kg Ni in particulate form. The high concentrations of metals during ebb tides are clear indications of their contribution from the industrial conglomerates (industrial units of metallurgy, catalyst, fertilizer, and pesticides) located in the Periyar River. The significance of this study is that the export fluxes may increase further during the summer monsoon (June to September), which may impact the abundant fishery emanating in the coastal environment during the period due to intense upwelling.

Comparisons are included for both the heights derived from the first return (the "point-of-closest-approach" or POCA) and heights derived from delayed waveform returns ("swath" processing). While swath-processed heights are normally less precise than edited POCA heights, e.g. standard deviations of similar to 3 and similar to 1.5m respectively for the western Greenland site, the increased coverage possible with swath data complements the POCA data and provides useful information for both system calibration and improving digital elevation models (DEMs). We show that the pre-launch interferometric baseline coupled with an additional roll correction (similar to 0.0075 degrees +/- 0.0025 degrees), or equivalent phase correction (similar to 0.0435 +/- 0.0145 radians), provides an improved calibration of the interferometric SARIn mode. We extend the potential use of SARIn data by showing the influence of surface conditions, especially melt, on the return waveforms and that it is possible to detect and measure the height of summer supraglacial lakes in western Greenland. A supraglacial lake can provide a strong radar target in the waveform, stronger than the initial POCA return, if viewed at near-normal incidence. This provides an ideal situation for swath processing and we demonstrate a height precision of similar to 0.5m for two lake sites, one in the accumulation zone and one in the ablation zone, which were measured every year from 2010 or 2011 to 2016. Each year the lake in the ablation zone was viewed in June by ascending passes and then 5.5 days later by descending passes, which allows an approximate estimate of the filling rate. The results suggest that CryoSat waveform data and measurements of supraglacial lake height change could complement the use of optical satellite imagery and be helpful as proxy indicators for surface melt around Greenland.					; Dunse, Thorben/IQT-9832-2023	Dunse, Thorben/0000-0002-4362-4265; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAY 4	2017	11	3					1041	1058		10.5194/tc-11-1041-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1041-2017													WOS:000400690900001

Bohai Bay is a representative area of global change research in East Asia, due to its unique geographical location and shallow water environment. Here, we present the results of a study of pollen, algae, and grain-size of a late Holocene sediment core from Qilihai Lagoon in Bohai Bay, which is the largest lagoon in North China. The results show that the Qilihai Lagoon area experienced three stages of environmental change in 3,100-1,000 cal yr BP: during 3,100-1,800 cal yr BP the regional vegetation was broadleaved forest dominated by Quercus with a small amount of Pinus, indicating that the regional climate was warm and wet. The level of the Bohai Sea was high, and the sampling site was a shallow bay environment. During 1,800-1,400 cal yr BP, corresponding to the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), coniferous trees and grassland expanded. The sedimentary environment of the sampling area was greatly influenced by terrestrial sediment sources as the sea level fell and sandbars were exposed. We speculate that the modern Qilihai Lagoon formed at ~ 1,800 cal yr BP. The lagoon shrank during the coldest interval of the DACP, and an extensive area of coastal wetland developed around the lagoon. During 1,400-1,000 cal yr BP the regional climate warmed, however, there was little change in the terrestrial vegetation. The lagoon became closed and the sedimentary environment was unstable due to the encroachment of coastal dunes driven. The coastal wetland began to decrease due to the expansion of the lagoon. Our study provides an important supplement for the environmental response research in the East Asian coastal areas, as well as other regions of the world.

Predictive occurrence models for bat species in California	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The ability to accurately predict the potential occurrence of species of management concern is useful for wildlife managers, particularly for those whose management activities involve large areas where sampling is difficult due to logistical or financial constraints. During the summers of 2002 and 2003, we used mist nets to capture bats (Myotis yumanensis, M californicus, M. evotis, M thysanodes, Eptesicus fuscus, Lasionycteris noctivagans, Tadarida brasiliensis, Antrozous pallidus, Lasiurus borealis, and Lasiurus cinereus) in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in north-central California, USA. We used landscape-scale variables, logistic regression, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to model species distributions and produce spatially discerning predictive occurrence maps. We developed a priori models that we used to determine which landscape-scale variables best discriminated between capture sites and non-capture sites. The odds of capturing a bat were 3.3 greater when total edge increased by 10,000 m, whereas for Yuma myotis (Myotis yumanensis), the odds of predicting presence were 0.2 greater when distance to lakes and ponds decreased by 2,000 m. Elevation was important in predicting the distribution of silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Increasing elevation by 400 m decreased the odds of capturing a silver-haired bat by 0.1 and a big brown bat by 0.4. Classification accuracy for our models ranged from 80.9% for all bat species combined to 72.3% for Yuma myotis and silver-haired bats. Predictive occurrence models can be valuable to bat conservation efforts because they provide spatial data important for evaluating the effects of management activities on species distributions.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				MAY	2007	71	3					693	700		10.2193/2005-692	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2005-692													WOS:000246495300003

Southern Patagonia, Argentina	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												Characterization and reconstruction of the Agassiz landslide using geospatial data. Southern Patagonia, Argentina. Glaciation and deglaciation modify the stress of the slopes affected by these processes and can trigger their instability and landslides. This study describes, characterizes and reconstructs a large rotational landslide of soil and moraine material, which occurred on February 10, 2013 on the western slope of Upsala Channel, North Branch of Argentino Lake, in Southern Patagonia. With this aim a qualitative analysis of the slope condition before and after the date of the landslide occurrence, the possible conditioning and triggering factors, and the destructive consequences of the related tsunami that affected the margins of the lake was carried out. To reconstruct the state of the slope before and after the event, techniques of photo-interpretation of optical satellite imagery, digital elevation models, historical photographs, in situ observations, bathymetric data and stories of the park rangers of Los Glaciares National Park were used. The retreat of the Upsala Glacier has caused the relaxation of the slopes of the channel conditioning its stability. Among the conditioning and triggering factors that favored the process of activation and generation of the landslide event, are the presence of unconsolidated moraine material covering the channel slopes, steep slopes exposed to the east, which increases its exposure to the sun and melting of snow accumulated during the winter, and the existence of soil creep processes. Although the specific triggering factor is unknown, sediment saturation by surface runoff and water infiltration, eventually a severe rain event, foot slope erosion by glacial activity, and local and regional seismic activity can be mentioned as potential triggering factors. The slope showed evidences of instability for more than 20 years prior to the generation of the landslide, and there is currently evidence that the slope may undergo.

Alisa			Isotopes in North American Rocky Mountain Snowpack 1993-2014	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present similar to 1300 new isotopic measurements (delta O-18 and delta H-2) from a network of snowpack sites in the Rocky Mountains that have been sampled since 1993. The network includes 177 locations where depthintegrated snow samples are collected each spring near peak accumulation. At 57 of these locations snowpack samples were obtained for 10-21 years and their isotopic measurements provide unprecedented spatial and temporal documentation of snowpack isotope values at mid-latitudes. For environments where snowfall accounts for the majority of annual precipitation, snowmelt is likely to have the strongest influence on isotope values retained in proxy archives. In this first presentation of the dataset we (1) describe the basic features of the isotope values in relation to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), (2) evaluate space for time substitutions traditionally used to establish delta O-18-temperature relations, (3) evaluate site-to-site similarities across the network and identify those that are the most regionally representative, (4) examine atmospheric circulation patterns for several years with spatially coherent isotope patterns, and (5) provide examples of the implications this new dataset has for interpreting paleoclimate records (Bison Lake, Colorado and Minnetonka Cave, Idaho). Results indicate that snowpack delta O-18 is rarely a simple proxy of temperature. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variance that reflect additional processes such as vapor transport and post-depositional modification. Despite these complexities we identify consistent climate-isotope patterns and regionally representative locations that serve to better define Holocene hydroclimate estimates and their uncertainty. Climate change has and will affect western U.S. snowpack and we suggest these changes can be better understood and anticipated by oxygen and hydrogen isotope-based reconstructions of Holocene hydroclimate using a process-based understanding of the controls on snowpack isotope ratios.

Sources and accumulation of sediment and particulate organic carbon in a subarctic fjard estuary: 210Pb, 137Cs, and δ13C records from Lake Melville, Labrador	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The sources and distribution of sediment and particulate organic carbon (OC) to Lake Melville, Labrador, were characterized to better understand impacts from climate and hydrological changes to the system. Mass accumulation rates (MARs) across the Lake Melville System (LMS) were established from 15 sediment cores collected in 2013 and 2014 by fitting excess Pb-210 (Pb-210(ex)) profiles to a two-layer advection-diffusion model. MARs, validated using Cs-137, varied between 0.04 and 0.41 g cm(-2) a(-1), and overall decreased with increasing distance from the Churchill River, which drains into Goose Bay, a western extension of Lake Melville. The Churchill River is the greatest source of sediment to the system, but surprisingly, MARs were greatest in western Lake Melville rather than Goose Bay, reflecting the contribution of fine material carried eastward in the Churchill River plume and inputs from nearby tributaries. A comparison of Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) inventories to expected atmospheric fallout (1.5 and 23.6 disintegrations per minute (dpm) cm(-2), respectively) in sediment across the LMS suggests particles are largely sourced from the watershed. In eastern Lake Melville, elevated Pb-210(ex) inventories and marine OC point to particle scavenging of dissolved Pb-210 from inflowing marine water. A transient tracer mixing model was used to determine the depth in each core where > 90% of sediment was deposited before and after hydroelectric development at Churchill Falls (1970) and applied to down-core profiles of OC and organic carbon isotopes (delta C-13(org)). We observed a significant increase of terrestrial OC to Lake Melville post 1970, which we interpret as change from climate or hydrology of the Churchill River.					; Macdonald, Robie/A-7896-2012	Macdonald, Robie/0000-0002-1141-8520; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	2017	54	9					993	1006		10.1139/cjes-2016-0167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2016-0167													WOS:000408538700006

Trial reintroduction of buff weka to an unfenced mainland site in central South Island, New Zealand	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												While there have been significant conservation successes through restoration of island biodiversity following the eradication of invasive predators, a major challenge remains to reintroduce native species within larger mainland systems that support suites of introduced mammalian predators. Strategies to enhance establishment and persistence of reintroduced populations include pre-release management to reduce post-release dispersal, and habitat restoration such as predator control at release sites. Evaluation of such strategies critically requires strategic and intensive post-release monitoring to identify drivers of success or the specific causes of failures. The buff weka (Gallirallus australis hectori), a flightless rail, was reintroduced to an unfenced mainland island on New Zealand's South. Past reintroductions on the mainland have all failed, but lack of post-release monitoring has meant the exact cause and timing of failures is unknown. We investigate the ability of buff weka to establish a mainland population in conjunction with high intensity predator control. Nineteen buff weka (15 males, 4 females) were transferred from predator-free islands in Lake Wakatipu, South Island, to Motatapu Station and held in a pre-release enclosure for 6weeks. Using a combination of very high frequency (VHF) and Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry, released birds were monitored every 2days for 4months post-release. Following release, no buff weka dispersed off Motatapu Station. Survival, however, was low and by the end of the study, 12 (63%) buff weka had been predated by introduced mustelids, ferrets (Mustela furo) and stoats (Mustela erminea). The lack of dispersal by buff weka suggests the presence of favourable resources on Motatapu Station. However, the low survival rate indicates that the predator-trapping network was insufficient to suppress predator numbers to a level low enough for buff weka population persistence.

In this study, determination of elemental concentrations in water and sediment was done. Shadegan wetland is one of the most important wetlands in southwest of Iran and is among the Ramsar-listed wetlands. Wastewaters from industries, urban activities and agricultural run off are released into this unique wetland in the region. In the present investigation, 12 sampling stations were selected for water and sediment collection in Shadegan wetland during winter, 2009. Physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity and salinity of water and pH, EC, total organic materials (TOM), grain size fraction and elements (Al, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) in sediments were measured. Also, macrobenthos communities were identified in sediments due to their important role in ecosystem health. Subsequently, lithogenous and anthropogenic portions of trace metals in sediment, trace elements bioaccessibility, along with I-geo and I-POLL indices were measured. According to obtained results, trace elements including Cu (39.5%), Pb (26%), Cr (24.1%), Cd (16.4%) and Zn (13.6%) had highest anthropogenic portion in study area. The two pollution indices used in the present investigation (I-geo and I-POLL) are indicative of different pollution intensity in Shadegan aquatic environment. The low pollution intensity values computed by I-geo might be acceptable for metals that have low anthropogenic values (less than 15% of their total concentrations). But higher anthropogenic values (16 to almost 40% of total concentration) for other studied metals show that an I-POLL pollution intensity formula is more reliable. Moreover, bioaccessibility concentrations amount for Ni, V, Pb and Co had strong and positive meaningful relationship with Cu, Cr and Cd.

J	OGLESBY, RT				OGLESBY, RT			RELATIONSHIPS OF FISH YIELD TO LAKE PHYTOPLANKTON STANDING CROP, PRODUCTION, AND MORPHOEDAPHIC FACTORS	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Fish yield is related to annual primary production, summer phytoplankton standing crop and the morphoedaphic index for lakes representing a wide variety of typologies by a series of models in the form of log-log regressions. Tentative boundary conditions are established by which lakes inappropriate to the models can be excluded. Confidence intervals for predicted values about the mean are given for the fish yield-phytoplankton standing crop regression. From this relation, potential yields for the lakes studied are reduced from a range of 10,000 to one of 25-fold. Efficiencies with which C is transferred from primary production to fish yield vary by 2-3 orders of magnitude and are highest for small, intensively managed ponds and lowest for large, deep, cold-water lakes. Models based on fish yield as a function of phytoplankton production or standing crop are inherently more accurate and subject to fewer exceptions than are those related to morphoedaphic factors. The former appear to be capable of substantial refinement but even in their present state might be employed to make useful predictions for groups of lakes. A suggested supplement to existing approaches in fishery management involves the following sequence: use of expectation-variability diagrams to obtain an overview of the problem, selection of an appropriate model or models to predict yield, prediction of a range of yields and implementation of regulations proved successful for other lakes in the same yield category.																									1977	34	12					2271	2279		10.1139/f77-305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-305													WOS:A1977ED63800002

Archaeal and bacterial communities of heavy metal contaminated acidic waters from zinc mine residues in Sepetiba Bay	EXTREMOPHILES												Mining of metallic sulfide ore produces acidic water with high metal concentrations that have harmful consequences for aquatic life. To understand the composition and structure of microbial communities in acid mine drainage (AMD) waters associated with Zn mine tailings, molecular diversity of 16S genes was examined using a PCR, cloning, and sequencing approach. A total of 78 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from samples collected at five different sites in and around mining residues in Sepetiba Bay, Brazil. We analyzed metal concentration, physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters related to prokaryotic diversity in low metal impacted compared to highly polluted environments with Zn at level of gram per liter and Cd-Pb at level of microgram per liter. Application of molecular methods for community structure analyses showed that Archaea and Bacteria groups present a phylogenetic relationship with uncultured environmental organisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that bacteria present at the five sites fell into seven known divisions, alpha-Proteobacteria (13.4%), beta-Proteobacteria (16.3%), gamma-Proteobacteria (4.3%), Sphingobacteriales (4.3%), Actinobacteria (3.2%) Acidobacteria (2.1%), Cyanobacteria (11.9%), and unclassified bacteria (44.5%). Almost all archaeal clones were related to uncultivated Crenarchaeota species, which were shared between high impacted and low impacted waters. Rarefaction curves showed that bacterial groups are more diverse than archaeal groups while the overall prokaryotic biodiversity is lower in high metal impacted environments than in less polluted habitats. Knowledge of this microbial community structure will help in understanding prokaryotic diversity, biogeography, and the role of microorganisms in zinc smelting AMD generation and perhaps it may be exploited for environmental remediation procedures in this area.

Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE) has been linked to higher rates of cancer, reproductive problems, and endocrine disorders. To investigate the effects of exposure to persistent contaminants of the Great Lakes Basin, the health departments of five Great Lakes states formed a health-assessment consortium. Between 1988 and 1994, the consortium collected demographic and fish consumption information from 2548 licensed charter boat captains, 182 anglers, and 1667 referents. Between 1994 and 1995, a subset of 619 participants in this study provided additional fish consumption information and donated blood samples that were analyzed for PCBs and DDE. Follow-up studies conducted between 2001 and 2005 re-assessed fish consumption rates and blood levels of PCBs and DDE in 293 of these individuals. While there was a trend for increasing overall fish consumption among most participant groups, sportfish and Great Lakes sportfish consumption decreased significantly in the captains over the study period. Serum DDE concentrations, which were highest in men in the captain and angler groups, declined in 90% of study participants. Mean DDE levels fell from 5.6 to 3.2 mu g/L. Total PCB levels declined in 80% of participants with the mean concentration failing from 4.2 to 2.8 mu g/L. Annual declines in serum DDE and PCB concentrations averaged 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.

Italy)	INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT												The reproductive biology of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was studied during 1999 in a natural population living in Lake Como (N. Italy), with particular reference to the differences in behavior between young and adult mussels. Histological analysis of gonads was used to study the gametogenic cycles and to evaluate when the young reached sexual maturity. Signs of active gametogenesis were detected in greater than or equal to4 mm shell length mussels. Mature gametes and the first spawning events were observed in greater than or equal to5 mm males and in greater than or equal to6 females. The gonad feature of greater than or equal to7 mm mussels was similar to that of the adults. Size frequency distributions revealed that the new generation (0(+)) first spawned in the year following birth, but only after winter. The length of larval time seemed to vary greatly depending on the spawning period, in addition to the environmental conditions. The first settled mussels greater than or equal to500 mum in shell length were observed 3-4 months after the first depositions. Water temperature seemed to be the most important factor which regulated sexual phenomena of both young and adult mussels. Its role in the onset of the spawning events was confirmed, but it is important to point out that temperature is not enough to trigger reproduction since gamete release is impossible without sufficient energy, especially for young mussels.

J	OHara, SL; Metcalfe, SE				OHara, SL; Metcalfe, SE			Reconstructing the climate of Mexico from historical records	HOLOCENE												There is a growing number of studies that use historical sources to reconstruct recent environmental change. In Mexico there are abundant sources of information that can be used to determine variations in the climate over the historical period. In this paper we draw together information from a variety of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct fluctuations in the climate of central Mexico over the last 600 years. The Aztecs are believed to have entered the Basin of Mexico during a period of severe drought. Wet conditions, however, characterized much of the Aztec (AD 1345-1521) and early colonial period prior to a return to drier conditions in the 1640s. Between 1640 and 1915, a series of severe droughts caused widespread devastation throughout central Mexico, particularly during the mid- to late 1700s and late 1800s. Since the early 1900s this region has experienced slightly wetter conditions. The climatic record from the Basin of Mexico is compared with proxy climatic data from two other areas in Mexico: a detailed lake-level curve from Lake Patzcuaro in central Mexico and the few tree-ring records from northern Mexico. Although the palaeoclimatic records from central Mexico are similar, there is greater divergence between the records from central and northern Mexico. In general, fluctuations in the climate over the last 600 years can be explained by changes in the relative strength of the summer 'monsoon', but it is possible that ENSO events can cause considerable differences in prevailing climate conditions in the northern and central parts of the country.

Study focus: This study investigates how water residence time and stratification affect water quality in an artificial brackish water system, which has different characteristics from natural environments and is under-researched, using numerical simulations. Various hydrodynamic conditions, including freshwater discharge and travel distances, were analyzed to understand their impact on residence times and stratification, offering insights for optimizing water quality management. New hydrological insights for the region: This study demonstrates that stratification significantly impacts water quality more than residence time in artificial brackish waterways. In contrast to lakes or reservoirs, increasing freshwater discharge in artificial brackish waterways can enhance stratification, reducing vertical mixing and degrading water quality, especially in the bottom layers. In the F0 scenario, excluding freshwater inflow increased summer maximum dissolved oxygen by 1.37 times compared to the validation case. This suggests that breaking stratification, such as through underwater aeration systems, may be more effective than focusing on residence time. In the L15 scenario, with the longest travel distance, upstream total nitrogen and total phosphorus increased by 18.37 % and 26.12 %, while downstream levels decreased by 3.35 % and 10.52 %. Additionally, poorer quality freshwater can degrade overall water quality, even with shorter residence times. These findings emphasize the need for careful management of inflowing water to maintain water quality in artificial brackish waterways.																				2214-5818				FEB	2025	57								102091	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102091													WOS:001371361700001

Using GIS to predict habitat in lakes: An example using nearshore substrate categories	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Habitat is an integral component of lake ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic alterations. Quantifying habitat is typically done with labor intensive and spatially limited surveys (i.e., transects) or with surveys requiring specialized field equipment combined with computer analyses (i.e., sonar). These approaches are limited to inventorying habitat condition and do not directly describe processes that influence habitat distributions. We developed a framework that utilizes geographic information systems (GIS) to answer habitat-based questions and allows for an understanding of the factors that influence its distribution. This framework uses GIS-derived data to describe factors input as predictive variables. We tested this framework by predicting nearshore substrate composition in Minnesota lakes. Substrate composition was measured during the summers of 2014-2016 along transects in 28 lakes across Minnesota. Composition was then grouped into three size categories (muck, sandy gravel, and coarse). For each transect, we obtained GIS-derived data describing exposure (fetch), riparian height, maximum depth, wind power, and bathymetric aspect to use as predictor variables in a classification tree model. We randomly selected 15% of transects to validate the model. Using repeated sampling with replacement, we determined this model predicted substrate composition with 62.0-71.0% accuracy. We then used data from all study lakes and examples from Belle Lake, Minnesota, to determine sources of error. Our results demonstrate that a GIS framework can describe both the distribution of a habitat component and the factors structuring it. This framework can enhance communication effectiveness and decision-making processes regarding habitat protection, management, and restoration.

Spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of burrowing mayfly nymphs (Ephemeroptera: Hexagenia limbata and H-rigida) in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In the early 1990s, burrowing mayfly species reappeared in sediments of the western basin of Lake Erie after an absence of over 30 years due to episodic hypoxia at the sediment-water interface. Long-term monitoring of adult mayflies at shoreline areas had revealed that Hexagenia rigida was more abundant than Hexagenia limbata during the initial recolonization period, but was gradually replaced by H. limbata. We hypothesized that this shift in dominance would be confirmed by the distribution and abundance of nymphs. We identified nymphs collected each spring throughout western Lake Erie from 1997 to 2004. The relative abundances of H. rigida and H. limbata nymphs exhibited the same temporal sequence as adults. Furthermore, the number of sites in the western basin in which H. rigida occurred decreased as the occurrence frequency of H. limbata increased. H. limbata were dominant in the basin by 2004. Hexagenia limbata nymphs persisted in the center-most part of the basin, whereas H. rigida did not, possibly due to differences in tolerance to hypoxia. There were no significant differences in body size between the two populations. Differences in dispersal distance from source populations and the timing and success of egg hatching likely accounted for the initial colonizing success of H. rigida, but the differential ability of H. limbata eggs to overwinter in sediments and possible tolerance of nymphs to hypoxia has possibly led to its current dominance in the western basin.

Five piston cores (2 inside, 1 on the rim and 2 outside of the pockmark) were collected and analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, physical properties and Pb-210 and Cs-137 concentrations. A yearlong subsurface mooring, equipped with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and vertical temperature chain, was placed in the deepest section of the pockmark (27.7 m). A second temperature chain was placed along the pockmark floor and over its rim. At the base of the mooring, 35 mm stereo cameras and a Savonius rotor current meter (similar to 0.3 m above the lake floor) were installed. Bottom photographs show episodic events of suspended sediment. Temperature data show the presence of anomalously cold temperature water near the rim of the pockmark during stratified periods and anomalously warmer water temperatures during isothermal winter type conditions. Coarser grain size and bulk density occur inside the pockmark with an associated decrease in water content in comparison to sediment outside the pockmark. Radionuclide results show no detectable net accumulation of sediment within the rim of the pockmark, slight accumulation in the deepest part of the pockmark, and only a few tenths of a mm/yr accumulation outside. This pockmark was most likely formed by groundwater seepage and is subsequently modified by continuing groundwater seepage and bottom-flowing currents. Taylor column and frictional boundary layer dynamics are believed to play a role in the circulation within this feature.					; Manley, Thomas/JGE-0411-2023	Watzin, Mary/0000-0003-2041-8546; 															0-306-48469-2				2004							299	329																WOS:000224236900017
J	Fisher, WL; Surmont, AF; Martin, CD				Fisher, WL; Surmont, AF; Martin, CD			Warmwater stream and river fisheries in the southeastern United States: Are we managing them in proportion to their values?	FISHERIES												We compared findings on stream and river fishing activity in the southeastern United States from the 1991 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-associated Recreation with those on stream and river management programs in this region from a 1995 survey by Warmwater Streams Committee of the Southern Division of the American Fisheries Society. Based on the 1991 national survey, two-fifths of all anglers in the Southeast fished streams and rivers; almost one-fourth of the total number of days fished by southeastern anglers were in this water type; and more than half of all trip expenditures, including those associated with lakes, reservoirs, and ponds, were made by stream and river anglers. In comparison, southeastern state agencies reported in 1995 that they allocated 10%-19% of their total fisheries budget and an average of 5 people to programs that manage stream and river resources. Approximately one-third of the states had completed fish inventories of less than one-third of their streams and rivers. One-fourth did not have an active warmwater stream and river management program. States with high angler use and abundant stream and river resources tended to have well-developed management programs (e.g, Virginia, West Virginia), whereas states with low use and limited riverine resources had less-developed programs (e.g., Oklahoma, Texas). The remaining states fell between this range. Given the substantial use of southeastern warmwater stream and river fisheries, we recommend that state agencies increase their emphasis on and proportionally allocate greater human and monetary resources toward managing these valuable resources.																			0363-2415					DEC	1998	23	12					16	24		10.1577/1548-8446(1998)023<0016:WSARFI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(1998)023<0016:WSARFI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000077349800003

We report here the combined method of sediment core correlation through Volume Magnetic Susceptibility profiles and sediment absolute dating, which permits drawing sediment accumulation rate maps. The Rhone River is the principal tributary to Lake Geneva, both in terms of water discharge and sediment load. Due principally to the construction of hydroelectric dams on major tributaries of the river, there has been an important modification to the yearly distribution of discharge. Although the total annual discharge is not affected the sediment load should be reduced because of the lower summer flows and sediment entrapment in dam reservoirs. To confirm this hypothesis, we analyze 82 sediment cores, recovered in the Rhone delta region in Lake Geneva. Volume Magnetic Susceptibility (VMS) profiles are used to successfully correlate 52 cores, using a "shifting and stretching" method. Two VMS peaks are dated as 1961 and 1943 using time markers ((137)Cs and Hg contamination) in seven cores. The numerous correlated VMS profiles enable maps of sediment accumulation rate to be constructed for two different periods. These maps show a clear decrease in sedimentation after 1961. From these maps, we estimate the sediment deficit to be 250,000 t y(-1). This value is comparable to the mass of sediment trapped in reservoirs located in the watershed.					; Dominik, Janusz/G-3707-2018; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/AAA-1165-2022	Loizeau, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0611-0388; 													0380-1330						1997	23	4					391	402		10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70921-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70921-3													WOS:000071611900002

High frequency climate variability of the Norwegian Atlantic Current during the early Holocene period and a possible connection to the Gleissberg cycle	HOLOCENE												A high-resolution sediment core (MD95-2011) from the Voring Plateau has been studied to document the variability of the surface water conditions during the Younger Dryas-Preboreal (13-9 kyr BP) in the eastern Norwegian Sea, in order to assess the climate variability in a period considered to be highly dynamic. Quantitative summer sea surface temperatures (SSSTs) with a time resolution of 20-40 years are reconstructed using three different diatom transfer function methods. The Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition at site MD95-2011 is documented with a temperature increase of 3.5 degrees C/3 degrees C within 100 years. Following, the record resolves for the first time PBO as two prominent cooling events centred at 11.2 and 11.3 kyr BP. In addition, a broad cooling event documented from 10.3-9.9 kyr BP coincides with previously documented climatic events as the 10.3 event and Erdalen Event 1 (10.1-9.9 kyr BP) and 2 (similar to 9.7 kyr BP), respectively. Constrained by the observed SSST changes and diatom assemblages, short-term SSST changes with a periodicity of 80-120 years are observed, and the length of this period might indicate a possible connection to the solar Gleissberg cycle. The NorthAtlantic heat transport is highly sensitive to freshwater inputs, and the interplay of freshwater forcing with insolation forcing is considered as the controlling mechanism of climate changes at site MD05-2011 during the early Holocene. However, the century-scale variability of 80-120 years cannot explain the large-scale variability during the early Holocene, but is of importance for understanding the underlying small-scale oscillations.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2010	20	2					245	255		10.1177/0959683609350391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683609350391													WOS:000274900800009

Currently used methods for electro-immobilizing batches of fish incorporate a period of hyperactivity that serves to reduce spinal injuries in fish. However, like the hyperactive period that is seen in other fish immobilization techniques, it provides a visually unappealing effect and introduces questions surrounding humane animal treatment. In this study, three different electro-immobilization treatments were evaluated for rates and severity of injury as well as time to immobilization to determine ways of reducing the hyperactive period while also maintaining low rates of injury. Tests were conducted in a Smith-Root EA-1000B System on adult summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss at the Cowlitz Salmon Hatchery (Salkum, Washington). Treatments included an electrical output setting commonly used at the facility, two experimental electrical outputs, and a chemical anesthetic (MS-222) treatment that served as a control. Efficacy, indicated as time to immobilization, was evaluated among electrical output treatments; humane fish treatment, measured by hemorrhage, spinal injuries, and mortality, was quantified and compared among all treatments. Analysis of variance indicated a significant difference in induction times among electrical treatment groups, which ranged from 14.2 +/- 4.9 to 53.4 +/- 2.6s (mean +/- 95% CI). Some spinal and hemorrhage injuries were observed in all treatment groups; however, only one electrical treatment had significantly higher (P=0.003) incidence and severity of injuries compared to the control. Results indicate that hatchery managers can significantly reduce the time needed to immobilize fish while maintaining minimal fish injury rates when using a commercial electro-immobilization system.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JUL	2018	80	3					239	248		10.1002/naaq.10023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/naaq.10023													WOS:000439551300001

In this regard, studies of the chemical composition of the constituents of the atmosphere have an important practical application. In 2020 and 2021, we studied the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosol, one of the indicators of air pollution, in the atmosphere of the coastal zone of the southern basin of Lake Baikal compared to the data from previous years. The studies were carried out in the summer on the southwestern (Bolshiye Koty) and southeastern coast (Boyarsky). In the absence of smoke in the aerosol on the southwest coast, the concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and SO42- ions prevailed. The mean total concentration of ions at the Bolshiye Koty research station was 2.08 +/- 1.26 mu g/m(3). The appearance of smog contributed to the growth of the total ionic concentration in the aerosol on the southwest coast to 6.4 mu g/m(3) in 2020 and to 17.6 mu g/m(3) in 2021. On the southeast coast, the minimum concentration of the total amount of ions was 3.3 mu g/m(3). The concentrations of Ca2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, and SO42- ions prevailed in the aerosol. Under the influence of smog, the total amount of ions increased to 34.1 mu g/m(3) in 2020 and to 18.6 mu g/m(3) in 2021. In periods of intense smoke, NH4+ and SO42- became the dominant ions in the aerosols at both stations. The contribution of NO3- ions increased. Although the effect of natural factors is periodic, they contribute significantly to the change in the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosol.

Water/rock interactions, chemical weathering and erosion, and supergene enrichment in the Tapira and Catala∼o I alkaline-carbonatite complexes, Brazil	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Alkaline-carbonatite complexes from the Alto Parnaiba Igneous Province (APIP) host important supergene concentrations of Nb, REE, P, and Ti. To quantify water/rock interaction and the interplay of chemical weathering and erosion that results in supergene enrichment, the chemistry of solutions draining the Tapira and Catalao I complexes were studied and the transfer of elements within and out of the weathering profiles quantified. Ca2+ and HCO3- are the main ions in surface water samples draining both watersheds, with an average annual flux of 49 t/km(2)/a of dissolved load. Total dissolved loads are highest during the summer (wet) months. The annual fluxes of Cl-, PO(4)(3-& nbsp;)and NO3- yield negative values, suggesting significant input of these species from rainwater. The fluvial transport of dissolved elements due to silicate weathering, carbonate dissolution and rainfall input is ~& nbsp;26, 3 and 19 t/km(2)/a at Tapira and 29, 3 and 18 t/km(2)/a at Catalao I. Chemical weathering rates of alkaline rocks are ~& nbsp;4 m/Ma at Tapira and-5 m/Ma at Catalao I. Constitutive mass balance suggests an eroded rock column of 84 m at Tapira and 39 m at Catalao I, with long-term erosion rates of 1.3 and 0.9 m/Ma, respectively. In contrast, long-term weathering rates were 3.0 m/Ma at Tapira and 2.4 m/Ma at Catalao I. Internal collapse of saprolites due to mass loss creates internal basins with an overburden of soils, locally transported material and lake sediments. Carbonate congruent dissolution, silicate incongruent dissolution and hydrolysis, and phosphate and oxide (pyrochlore) dissolution-reprecipitation are the main water/rock interactions in the Tapira and Catala & SIM;o I alkaline-carbonatite complexes that promote the enrichment of primary and secondary minerals and produce supergene P, Ti, Nb and REE deposits in the isalteritic saprolites; Ti is residually enriched in the alloteritic saprolite at Tapira.

J	Coulson, S; Al-Attar, D; Mitrovica, J				Coulson, Sophie; Al-Attar, David; Mitrovica, Jerry			An extended ice-age sea-level equation: incorporating water flux across sills	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												We present a generalized theory governing gravitationally self-consistent, spatio-temporal sea-level changes within an ocean-plus-lake system that is intermittently connected by water mass flux across a sill. Our expressions for the change in sea level (defined as the difference in height of the sea-surface equipotential relative to the solid surface) hold for any Earth model, and easily incorporate effects of viscoelastic deformation of the solid Earth and perturbations in both the gravitational field and rotation vector (as is now standard in ice-age sea-level calculations). In its most general fonn, the theory also includes an exact treatment of the evolving shoreline position in both water bodies. Our formalism involves three cases: (1) one global ocean, in which mass transfer may occur between ice sheets and the global ocean; (2) an ocean and lake separated by an exposed sill, in which mass transfer may occur between ice sheets and the global ocean, and between the ocean and lake via evaporative flux and (3) transitional phases between these two states, when the ocean surface reaches the height of the sill from below (i.e. the sill is breached) or above (the sill is exposed). We illustrate the new theory using examples from the Black Sea flooding during the last deglacial phase (similar to 10 ka) and sea-level fall in the Mediterranean Sea during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.96-5.33 Ma). These examples demonstrate the importance of including the geophysical feedbacks associated with sea-level change in an isolated basin in the dynamics of flooding and desiccation.

J	Miranda, LE; Hargreaves, JA; Raborn, SW				Miranda, LE; Hargreaves, JA; Raborn, SW			Predicting and managing risk of unsuitable dissolved oxygen in a eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Eutrophication or lakes is often accompanied by wide diel fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations that can influence fish assemblage composition and periodically result in highly visible fish kills. We conducted a probabilistic risk assessment to estimate the likelihood that a shallow eutrophic oxbow lake would be affected by critically low DO concentration at dawn during mid-summer. Monte-Carlo simulations with a respiration model that considered DO concentration at dusk, water respiration rate, sediment respiration rate, air-water diffusive exchange, and night duration Were Used to generate a depth-specific probability distribution of DO concentrations for the following dawn. This probability distribution was combined with a bathymetric model of the lake, constructed in a geographic information system using geo-referenced depth data, to predict the probability that a certain area of the lake would be affected by critically low DO concentration. The area affected was evaluated as a function of lake Stage elevation. Results of the risk assessment pointed to the importance of shallow water (<1 m depth) in determining the area of unsuitable DO at dawn. Simulation results suggested that water level manipulation can be used to reduce the probability of frequent unsuitable DO events that affect small areas of the lake, and simultaneously reduce the area of infrequent unsuitable DO events that affect large areas of the lake. High-probability unsuitable DO events affecting small areas of the lake are not of major concern because fish are able to locate refugia of suitable DO in adjacent areas. However, water level management in shallow eutrophic lakes can have a major effect on reducing the risk of low-probability unsuitable DO events that affect large areas of the lake.

We infer the palaeo-vegetation and palaeo-environmental conditions between 9900 and 1800 cal B.P. through a 1.80 m deep sediment profile, from the remote location of Charilam, Tripura, using biotic (fossil pollen) and abiotic (mineral magnetism) proxies. The sediment profile recorded warm and humid conditions between 8300 and 6200 cal B.P., which later shifted towards less humid phase until 4900 cal B.P. The lower part of the sediment profile provided evidence of enhanced sea-level in this region, as manifested by mangrove taxa found between 9900 and 4900 cal B.P. But later, these taxa were minimal and thereafter, diminished in the sediments during the Late Holocene (4100-1800 cal B.P.).The occurrence of fewer tree taxa and dominance of larger grass pollen signify the enhancement of anthropogenic activities in the region, during the recent times. The shifts in mineral magnetic content towards fine-grained anti-ferrimagnetic hematite components, as exhibited by relatively high Hard IRM, SIRM/XLF, ARM/SIRM ratio and low S-ratio towards the end of the Middle Holocene, resonate with the climate variations concurrent to the vegetation changes. These interpretations lead to the perception of a reduction in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) strength during the Late Middle Holocene. The inception of anthropogenic activities has also induced the changes in the vegetation cover, leading to increased soil erosion and land-use changes during the Late Holocene in the region, which are well observed in the pollen and mineral magnetic records. This study focuses on multi-proxy analyses of the Holocene sediments in this part of northeast India, which has no such previous records.

However, our understanding of its temporal stability in freshwater ecosystems is still limited. In the present study, we used a size spectrum approach to investigate the responses of 126 lake fish communities to changes in the intensity of three common anthropogenic stressors (i.e., global warming, nutrient loading and biological invasions) in French natural lakes and reservoirs over an average 5-year time period. Using a backward selection on a full model including all possible effects of stressors on the size spectrum slope, we demonstrated that (i) increasing summer temperature shifted fish abundance towards the largest size classes, resulting in a flatter size spectrum slope and (ii) nutrient loading and biological invasions were associated with a shift towards smaller size classes in natural lakes, while the opposite effect was observed in reservoirs. In addition, these two stressors interacted in determining changes in the size structure of fish communities, complicating what the size spectrum can reveal about changes in stressor intensity during monitoring programs. All predictors accounted for a limited part of the observed changes in size spectra, and further investigations are needed to fully apprehend the interplay between natural and human-induced drivers of the temporal changes in size spectra in contrasting environmental conditions.

Holocene vegetation and wildfire disturbance in boreal central Yukon, Canada	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Sediment cores were collected from Wrong (WL) and Lenore (LL) lakes in boreal central Yukon Territory, Canada, spanning circa 6000 years. Analyses of pollen, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, levoglucosan, and down-scaled paleoclimatic data reveal the vegetation history and character/drivers of Holocene fire disturbance. Boreal forest has persisted in the region for millennia, with a regional mid-Holocene expansion of Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb. followed by expansion of Pinus contorta var. latifolia Douglas ex Loudon Engelm. ex S. Watson in the latest Holocene. The shortest reconstructed fire return intervals (FRIs; ca. 110-125 years) occurred in the mid-Holocene, coincident with the development of highly flammable Picea-dominated forest and warm, dry summers that were characterized by elevated June-August 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies (JJA Z500) and associated with an eastward/intense Aleutian Low. In the late-Holocene, FRI increased to ca. 240 years at WL and 280 years LL. Drivers of this change include regional cooling and increased precipitation, with a westward/weaker Aleutian Low position delivering more moisture to interior Yukon. Longer FRIs allowed for greater fuel accumulation between fires, enhancing fire size/severity. While higher fire frequency is noted in the mid-Holocene and increased fire size/severity in the late-Holocene, recent changes in Yukon fire disturbance suggest that the fire regime may soon lie outside the natural range of mid- and late-Holocene variability.

J	Zebek, E				Zebek, Elzbieta			LONG-TERM CYANOBACTERIAL DYNAMICS AS RELATED TO PHYSICOCHEMICAL WATER PARAMETERS IN A RESTORED URBAN LAKE	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												The aim of this study has been to determine the response of cyanobacteria to the lake protection and restoration measures implemented in the littoral zone of an urban lake called Jeziorak Maly. The first investigations were conducted in 1996 and were resumed in 1997-2003, 2005 and 2013, following the installation of a separator and the creation of stone accumulation sites. Long-term changes in phytoplankton cyanobacterial proportions, abundance and biomass were analyzed in relation to environmental conditions at the sites in the littoral zone (S - separator pipes, K - sites with stones and R - sites with macrophytes). Relationships between cyanobacteria and water chemistry variables were analyzed by calculating the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and then with canonical correspondence analysis (RDA). The results provided evidence that water temperature, total nitrogen and iron concentration (S, R), but also PO43- in spring (S,K) were the principal factors affecting cyanobacterial development. There was a significant decrease in the share, abundance and biomass of cyanobacteria coinciding with a decrease in conductivity and PO43- following the onset of lake restoration efforts. Changes in dominant species from the ones typical in hypertrophic lakes to those typically found in eutrophic lakes took place during the research. The modifications indicated a strong initial response of cyanobacteria to the restoration measures, but the situation stabilized in 2013, when cyanobacteria returned to their previous average levels. This suggests that the introduction of lake restortation measures contributed to the lake's improved water quality and they should be retained for efficient lake management in the future.

Seismic modelling of an outcrop is used to calibrate the seismic data and assist with interpretation. Seismic resolution is sufficient to image sandstone channel-fill complexes 4-5 m thick. Five seismic facies are recognized and interpreted as fluvial architectural elements of the Lower Freshwater Molasse. Two of these facies are characterized by fairly continuous reflections of variable frequency and low-to-moderate amplitude, interpreted as metre-thick channel-fill complexes. The lateral extent of such channels ranges from 100 to 170 m. The other three seismic facies are characterized by moderate-to-high amplitude, sub-parallel continuous reflections. The three facies are mainly distinguished using reflection frequency and continuity. They correspond to distinct floodplain settings, i.e. proximal, intermediate and distal, with respect to the active channel belt. On a larger scale, a portion of a ca. 50-m deep incised-valley system, probably caused by a relative base-level fall, was identified. Two distinct valley-fill units are recognized. The lower unit was interpreted as comprising valley-edge slump units by comparison with outcrop data. The upper unit is interpreted as the fluvial fill deposited in the most landward portion of the valley. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main objectives are: (1) To search the shallow shelf along the north coast of Turkey for submerged evidence of ancient humans from more than 7000 years ago when the Black Sea was an inland lake 150 meters below present-day sea level; (2) To search the deep waters for ancient shipwrecks that may have well-preserved wooden structural components due to the anaerobic environment; and (3) to document with video and still images any archaeologically significant discoveries. Woods Hole Marine Systems Inc. (WHMSI) is developing a new suite of deep submergence vehicles and systems that will be devoted to IFE's marine archaeology expeditions in the Black Sea and elsewhere. Two underwater imaging vehicles have already been completed. The first, ARGUS, is an optical tow sled equipped with tilting underwater video and film cameras, HMI lights, an electronic still camera, thrusters to control heading, and a scanning sonar. In addition to its own imaging capabilities, ARGUS is also the depressor for LITTLE HERCULES, a mid-sized fully maneuverable imaging ROV designed to support a High Definition underwater video camera. Each vehicle will transmit real-time images of archaeological sites via a fiber optic umbilical cable to a control room on board the surface ship, where the imagery and data will be viewed, processed, analyzed, and archived. To supplement the lighting during the survey of an archeological site, WHMSI has also built a new offload lighting package.																					0-7803-6552-6				2000							661	665																WOS:000166107400101

Microbial Community of Umkhei Thermal Lake (Baikal Rift Zone) in the Groundwater Discharge Zone	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The diversity and functional activity of the microbial community of the bottom sediments and water of the thermal alkaline Umkhei Lake (Baikal Rift Zone), which was formed as a result of groundwater discharge, has been studied. The lake water is shown to be thermal hydrocarbonate-sulphate-sodium water of the Kuldur type. Lake sediments are characterized by higher temperatures and greater saturation with microelements. A comparative analysis of the species abundance of the microbial community of water and bottom sediments shows high indices of diversity in all layers of sediments, while the diversity in water is low. An analysis of taxonomic diversity reveals the predominance of the members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi phyla in the community of water and bottom sediments. The presence of bacteria with various metabolic pathways of substance and energy transformation in both production and destruction processes is determined. The sequences belonging to the genus Hydrogenophaga (class beta-Proteobacteria, phylum Proteobacteria), which is an indicator of the deep geochemical processes of hydrogen production, are found in the bottom layers of sediments. The rates of microbial processes of photosynthesis, dark assimilation of CO2, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis are determined to characterize the functional activity. The main part of the organic-matter production in water is found to be formed as a result of the activity of chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotes.

J	Chen, KN; Bao, CH; Zhou, WP				Chen, Kai-Ning; Bao, Chuan-He; Zhou, Wan-Ping			Ecological restoration in eutrophic Lake Wuli: A large enclosure experiment	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A large-scale enclosure experiment for lake restoration was carried out in Lake Wuli, a northern bay of shallow and eutrophic Lake Taihu in China. The large enclosure with an area of 10 ha was set up in the littoral zone and was bordered by waterproof fabric which did not cover the sediments. Multiple approaches were used and included fish removal, piscivorous fish stocking, shoreline reconstruction, aquatic macrophyte planting, benthic macro-animal stocking, and silver carp cultivation in pens for reduction of cyanobacteria. The results showed that the coverage of aquatic macrophytes increased from 0% to 45.7%. Mean concentrations of TN and TP inside the enclosure from May 2004 to May 2008 were 22.2% and 26.0% of those outside, respectively. Secchi depth was 0.40 m outside the enclosures and 0.75 m inside. However, responses of phytoplankton to the restoration project lagged behind improvement of water quality and reestablishment of aquatic plants. The phytoplankton biomass gradually decreased after the third year of the restoration. Stocking piscivorous fish and planting submerged macrophytes could not increase zooplankton biomass and enhance graze pressure on phytoplankton, most likely due to high omnivorous fish density and lower nutrition inside the enclosure. Higher grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton was observed in May and October every year. Zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios were significantly negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass outside (r = -0.440, p < 0.01) and inside the enclosure (r = -0.336, p < 0.05) from February 2004 to March 2007. Therefore, phytoplankton biomass inside and outside the enclosure was lower in May and October. Higher grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton in spring may result in occurrence of the clear-water phase that facilitated growth of submerged macrophytes in the littoral in Lake Wuli, and a clear-water state and improved water quality would likely be sustained throughout the year after reestablishment of submerged macrophytes.

J	España, JS; Pastor, ES; Pamo, EL				Espana, Javier Sanchez; Pastor, Esther Santofimia; Pamo, Enrique Lopez			Iron terraces in acid mine drainage systems:: A discussion about the organic and inorganic factors involved in their formation through observations from the Tintillo acidic river (Riotinto mine, Huelva, Spain)	GEOSPHERE												Iron terraces that form in acidic mine drainage settings are unique and extreme geomicrobiological systems that can provide highly relevant information about the interaction between microbes and their surrounding aqueous environments. These singular systems can represent, additionally, potential models for the study of ancient geological formations (e. g., banded iron formations, stromatolites) and/or for the cycling of iron on Mars. This work describes geochemical, mineralogical, morphological, and microbiological evidence obtained in the highly acidic and Fe-rich Tintillo River (Riotinto mines, Huelva, SW Spain), which can be used to speculate about the origin and nature of the terraced iron formations (TIFs) that are being currently formed in acid mine drainage environments. The size (up to 36 m long and 1 m thick) and continuity (strong development over 3.5 km) of the iron terraces offer a unique opportunity to study the different organic (mainly microbial) and inorganic processes involved in the construction of these characteristic, travertine-like, sedimentary structures. Evidence presented in this study suggests that both types of processes appear to be controlling factors in the formation and internal arrangement of the TIFs, although no definitive evidence has been found to support the prevalence of any of these mechanisms with respect to another. The photosynthetic production of dissolved oxygen by eukaryotic microorganisms ( green algae, euglenophytes, and diatoms) and the Fe-oxidizing metabolism of acidophilic prokaryotes are critical factors for the formation of TIFs, whereas abiotic parameters, such as water composition, flow rate and velocity, or stream channel geometry, also appear to be essential variables.

J.; Soulsby, Chris			Testing a spatially distributed tracer-aided runoff model in a snow-influenced catchment: Effects of multicriteria calibration on streamwater ages	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Integrating stable isotope tracers into rainfall-runoff models allows investigation of water partitioning and direct estimation of travel times and water ages. Tracer data have valuable information content that can be used to constrain models and, in integration with hydrometric observations, test the conceptualization of catchment processes in model structure and parameterization. There is great potential in using tracer-aided modelling in snow-influenced catchments to improve understanding of these catchments' dynamics and sensitivity to environmental change. We used the spatially distributed tracer-aided rainfall-runoff (STARR) model to simulate the interactions between water storage, flux, and isotope dynamics in a snow-influenced, long-term monitored catchment in Ontario, Canada. Multiple realizations of the model were achieved using a combination of single and multiple objectives as calibration targets. Although good simulations of hydrometric targets such as discharge and snow water equivalent could be achieved by local calibration alone, adequate capture of the stream isotope dynamics was predicated on the inclusion of isotope data in the calibration. Parameter sensitivity was highest, and most local, for single calibration targets. With multiple calibration targets, key sensitive parameters were still identifiable in snow and runoff generation routines. Water ages derived from flux tracking subroutines in the model indicated a catchment where runoff is dominated by younger waters, particularly during spring snowmelt. However, resulting water ages were most sensitive to the partitioning of runoff sources from soil and groundwater sources, which was most realistically achieved when isotopes were included in the calibration. Given the paucity of studies where hydrological models explicitly incorporate tracers in snow-influenced regions, this study using STARR is an important contribution to satisfactorily simulating snowpack dynamics and runoff generation processes, while simultaneously capturing stable isotope variability in snow-influenced catchments.

Effects of silver nanoparticles on bacterioplankton in a boreal lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used antimicrobial agents and a growing body of evidence suggests that their release into aquatic environments threatens natural bacterial communities and whole ecosystems. However, a knowledge gap exists between the toxic effects of AgNPs found in laboratory studies and their potential impacts in natural environments. In an enclosure experiment conducted in a boreal lake, we exposed natural bacterial communities to AgNPs with two common types of coatings (polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP) and citrate) under two different exposure regimes, a one-time (pulse) and a continuous (chronic) addition. AgNP additions increased Ag concentrations to nearly 50gL(-1) in the highest treatments. We examined bacterial responses (abundance, biomass, production, chlorophyll-a content and nutrient stoichiometry) over the course of 6weeks in the summer of 2012. Bacterioplankton exposed to AgNPs initially accumulated Ag over the experimental period regardless of AgNP concentration or coating. After the initial period of increase, Ag in the bacterial size fraction changed largely in concert with bacterial biomass. We found no toxic effects of AgNPs on bacterioplankton abundance, biomass, production or chlorophyll-a content throughout the experiment. Bacterial production was greater after the pulse addition of PVP-coated AgNPs and in the chronic addition of PVP-coated AgNPs at the highest concentrations. Furthermore, AgNPs produced no significant changes in nutrient stoichiometry of the bacterioplankton size fraction. This lack of effects of AgNPs on lake bacterioplankton observed under the natural conditions studied here differs from results of short-term and laboratory studies of single-species bacterial cultures. Our results thus indicate AgNP effects in lakes may be less than expected based on standard laboratory experiments, and that additional studies are needed to understand AgNP toxicity under realistic natural conditions in lakes and other ecosystems.

Of the 3 samplers which were used simultaneously, the G.E. Bacterial Air Sampler gave slightly higher readings than the Bourdillon Slit Sampler, while the filter gave low readings throughout. Daily averages of bacteria at ground level ranged from 0.9 to 30.1 per cu. ft. and in the flight to Resolute Bay from 0.3 to 0.9 per cu. ft. while the comparable readings of the fungi were 0.5 to 4.4 and 0.01 to 0.7 per cu. ft. with the slit sampler. Considerable variation occurred in ground level samples, not only from day to day but throughout the day. Silicone slide studies revealed high numbers, up to 115 per cu. ft., which includes a high proportion of nonviable fungus spores. Most of the organisms are soil inhabiting forms but some fungus parasites were present, chiefly as smut (Ustilago) spores. Evidence indicates that winds originating in the south carry large numbers of organisms northward, many of which are nonviable when they reach the arctic, while north winds of polar origin contain very low numbers even in summer.																			0008-4026						1953	31	1					107	122		10.1139/b53-010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b53-010													WOS:A1953XS89000010

Late Neogene basin history at Honey Lake, northeastern California: Implications for regional tectonics at 3 to 4 Ma	LATE CENOZOIC STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE GREAT BASIN-SIERRA NEVADA TRANSITION	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Neogene sediments in a structural and geomorphic high in the southwestern Honey Lake basin represent lacustrine deposition from 3.7 to 2.9 Ma, interrupted once by a significant lowstand. Tephras in the upper section are 3.26 Ma and 3.06 Ma. A thick debris-flow bed, truncated by an erosional surface and overlain concordantly by a thin interval of subaerial sediments, is evidence for lake-level fall at ca. 3.4 Ma. The dominant structure is a broad east-southeast-plunging anticline cut by several sets of faults. These include northwest-striking dextral and northeast-striking sinistral strike-slip faults and a conjugate set of west-northwest-striking thrust faults; all are consistent with north-south shortening. Mutually crosscutting relationships between faults, and tilt fanning of the dextral faults, indicate that tightening of the anticline was synchronous with faulting. A Quaternary strand of the dextral Honey Lake fault crops out near the northern end of the exposure, suggesting that the cause of the local shortening and uplift was a contractional stepover between two strands of the Honey Lake fault. The Neogene section limits this faulting to some time after 2.9 Ma. The Honey Lake basin lies at the intersection of the Walker Lane with the Sierran frontal fault system. Although the timing of tectonic disruption was roughly consistent with passage of the triple junction to the west and with uplift and exhumation of several nearby basins, the described deformation seems to be directly related to dextral faulting, dating the propagation of a strand of the Honey Lake fault through the southwestern Honey Lake basin.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2447-8				2009	447						83	100		10.1130/2009.2447(06)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2447(06)													WOS:000271620800007

Paleoenvironmental and archaeological investigations at Qinghai Lake, western China: Geomorphic and chronometric evidence of lake level history	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Qinghai Lake, located on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Qing-Zang Gaoyuan), is China's largest extant closed-basin lake. Its position relative to major Asian climate systems makes it sensitive to global climate change. The lake has been the subject of numerous paleoenvironmental investigations including dating of shoreline features around the lake basin. Here we report new age estimates of shoreline features, geomorphic exposures and archaeological sites that contribute to the development of a lake-level history for Qinghai Lake and a landscape model of the Qinghai Lake Basin. Lake highstands above 3230 m (similar to 36 m above the modern lake level) appear to date to late MIS 5, similar to 70-110 ka. The lake has had much more modest highstands since then: no evidence of MIS 3 lake stands higher than modern were found, and early Holocene highstands are no more than similar to 12 m above modern. If the age of highstands greater than 3230 m is confirmed through future work, then the Qinghai Lake Basin hydrologic balance prior to similar to 70 ka was dramatically different than after that time, including during the Holocene. A simple hydrologic balance model provides insights into the combination of precipitation, evaporation, and runoff generation needed to sustain the lake at 3260 m, the highest shoreline observed. A range of factors may explain the difference, primarily the relative strength of the East Asian monsoon. The basin was apparently subject to extensive alluviation during MIS 3, interrupted by widespread erosion and development of cryogenic features before and during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Loess that presently drapes much of the lower basin landscape began to be deposited after the LGM, similar to 16-18 ka. The landscape model outlined here has implications for archaeological visibility of early human occupation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Brittain, JE; Borgstrom, R				Brittain, John E.; Borgstrom, Reidar			The Norwegian reference lake ecosystem, vre Heimdalsvatn	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The subalpine lake, vre Heimdalsvatn and its catchment, situated in the mountains of southern Norway, has been the subject of extensive ecosystem studies over the last 50 years covering a wide range of disciplines. The lake is located at 1,088 m a.s.l., has an area of 0.78 km(2), a maximum depth of 13 m, and a catchment area of 23.6 km(2). It lies more or less on the limit of the birch forest, while the catchment extends up over 1,800 m a.s.l. and into the high alpine zone. The valley is little influenced by human activity and there is no permanent habitation, although the area is used for grazing of domestic livestock during summer. Otherwise the lake and its catchment have always been important for fish and game. The catchment also received major radionuclide fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The studies include Quaternary history, the development of algorithms for remote sensing of snow conditions, long-term changes in lake ice cover and temperature, the zooplankton and benthic communities, as well as the uptake of Chernobyl radionuclides and mercury by the biota. The consequences of the introduction of the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) on the benthos, zooplankton and the brown trout (Salmo trutta) have also been investigated. The lake and its catchment are widely used in university teaching and thesis work. On account of the substantial knowledge base, vre Heimdalsvatn is well suited to long-term monitoring.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					5	12		10.1007/s10750-010-0154-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0154-6													WOS:000275782400002

We obtained carcasses of mink and river otters from commercial trappers during the winters 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. Necropsies included evaluation of the following biological parameters: sex, body mass and length, age, thymus, heart, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, kidney, gonad, omentum, adrenal gland and baculum masses, baculum length, and stomach contents. Livers were analyzed, individually or in pools, for residues of organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans. Contaminant levels were relatively low compared to those documented in other North American populations, although they ranged higher than those detected during an earlier survey (1990-1992) of these regional populations. Body condition varied slightly among collection regions, but showed no relationship with contaminant burden. Mink from the upper Fraser River had less fat stores and also had some of the lowest OC contamination levels observed. Similarly, a few individuals with enlarged livers and kidneys had low contaminant levels. Although a few individual animals with gross abnormalities of reproductive systems did not show high levels of contamination, there was a significant negative correlation between total PCB concentrations (as Aroclor 1260) and baculum length in juvenile mink (r = 0.707; p = 0.033; n = 8). The association of juvenile baculun length with eventual reproductive success is unknown, but further characterization of reproductive organ morphology and relationship to contaminants should be undertaken in a larger subset of these populations.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				FEB	1999	107	2					141	147		10.2307/3434371	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3434371								9924010					WOS:000078816500024
J	Belay, D; Asrat, A				Belay, Dershaye; Asrat, Asfawossen			GIS-Based Susceptibility Mapping of the Fentale-Metehara Blisters and Blister Caves in the Main Ethiopian Rift: Implications for Their Conservation	GEOHERITAGE												The biggest and most spectacular blister caves in the world are found in the Fentale-Metehara area, in the Main Ethiopian Rift, where we inventoried 639 blisters and blister caves in an area of 80 sq. km straddling between the southern foot of Fentale volcano and the northern shore of Lake Beseka. The blisters were formed by a unique geological process involving up-doming of fluid-rich pyroclastic flows due to pressure of gases entrapped in the progressing flow, and subsequent breaching of some of the hollow domes. These unique geological heritages have been threatened, in some cases already destroyed, by various man-made and natural factors such as the unprecedented expansion of Lake Beseka, extensive infrastructure development (roads, railways, settlements and urbanization, and large-scale irrigation schemes), and younger fissural lava flows. In order to systematically determine the degree of threat quantitatively and qualitatively and evaluate the probability of destruction of any of the blisters and blister caves, we applied GIS-based frequency ratio model and non-hierarchical cluster analysis techniques and produced a susceptibility map of the area. The susceptibility map, validated using the degree of fitness technique, indicates that most of the blister field falls within very high to high susceptibility of destruction, implying that the destruction of most of these spectacular features is imminent particularly due to expansion of Lake Beseka and the Metehara town. This calls for concerted effort by the local authorities to devise mechanisms to protect the threatened blisters and blister caves along with mitigating the impacts of the expanding Lake Beseka. The susceptibility map will be helpful to guide and prioritize conservation efforts.

J	Waldmann, N; Starinsky, A; Stein, M				Waldmann, Nicolas; Starinsky, Abraham; Stein, Mordechai			Primary carbonates and Ca-chloride brines as monitors of a paleo-hydrological regime in the Dead Sea basin	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lakes Samra, Lisan and the Dead Sea occupied the Dead Sea basin during the Last Interglacial (similar to 140-75ka BP), last glacial (similar to 70-14 ka BP) and Holocene periods, respectively. The age of Lake Lisan and Samra was determined by U-Th dating of primary aragonites comprising parts of the lacustrine sedimentary sequences. The lakes have periodically deposited sequences of layered calcitic marls (Lake Sarnra) or laminated primary aragonite (Lake Lisan). The deposition of aragonite as the primary carbonate phase reflects the contribution of the incoming freshwater (loaded with bi-carbonate) and high Mg-, Ca-chloride brine that originated from the subsurface vicinity of the Dead Sea basin. Deposition of calcitic marls suggests a minor effect of the brines. The Ca-chloride subsurface brine has been migrating in and out of the wall rocks of the Dead Sea basin, reflecting the regional hydrological conditions. During most of the last glacial period and during the late Holocene, sufficient precipitation above the Judea Mountains pushed the subsurface Cachloride brines into the lakes causing the deposition of aragonite. During the Last Interglacial period the rain that precipitated above the Judea Mountains was insufficient to induce brine flow toward Lake Samra. It appears that sporadic floods provided calcium, bicarbonate and detritus to produce the Samra calcitic marls. Travertines deposited at the Samra-Lisan boundary indicate the early stage in the resumption of groundwater (springs) activity that led to the resurgence of Ca-chloride brine and rise of Lake Lisan. Similar variations in the regional rain precipitation and hydrological activity probably characterized the long-term geochetnical evolution of Pleistocene lacustrine water-bodies in the Dead Sea basin, enabling the use of the carbonates as paleo-hydrological monitors.

The carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of such carbonates depends on the delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Their oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) is controlled by the delta O-18 of the lake water and by water temperature during carbonate precipitation. Lake water delta O-18, in turn, reflects the delta O-18 of atmospheric precipitation in the catchment area, water residence time and mixing, and evaporation. A paleoclimatic interpretation of carbonate isotope records requires a site-specific calibration based on an understanding of these local conditions. For this study, samples of different biogenic carbonate components and water were collected in the littoral zone of Lake Locknesjon, central Sweden (62.99 degrees N, 14.85 degrees E, 328 ma.s.l.) along a water depth gradient from 1 to 8 m. Carbonate samples of living organisms and subfossil remains in surface sediments were taken from the calcifying alga Chara hispida, from bivalve mollusks of the genus Pisidium, and from adult and juvenile instars of two ostracod species, Candona candida and Candona neglecta. Our results show that neither the isotopic composition of carbonates nor the delta O-18 of water vary significantly with water depth, indicating a well-mixed epilimnion The mean delta C-13 of Chara hispida encrustations is 4 %o higher than the other carbonates. This is due to fractionation related to photosynthesis, which preferentially incorporates C-12 into the or ganic matter and increases the delta C-13 of the encrustations. A small effect of photosynthetic C-13 enrichment in DIC is seen in contemporaneously formed valves of juvenile ostracods. The largest differences in the mean carbonate delta O-18 between species are caused by vital offsets, i.e., the species-specific deviations from the delta O-18 of inorganic carbonate which would have been precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with the water. After subtraction of these offsets, the remaining differences in the mean carbonate delta O-18 between species can mainly be attributed to seasonal water temperature changes. The lowest delta O-18 values are observed in Chara hispida encrustations, which form during the summer months when photosynthesis is most intense. Adult ostracods, which calcify their valves during the cold season, display the highest delta O-18 values. The seasonal and interannual variability in lake water delta O-18 is small (similar to 0.5 parts per thousand) due to the long water residence time in the lake. Seasonal changes in the temperature-dependent fractionation are therefore the dominant cause of carbonate delta O-18 differences between species when vital offsets are corrected. Temperature reconstructions based on paleotemperature equations for equilibrium carbonate precipitation using the mean delta O-18 of each species and the mean delta O-18 of lake water are well in agreement with the observed seasonal water temperature range. The high carbonate delta O-18 variability of samples within a species, on the other hand, leads to a large scatter in the reconstructed temperatures based on individual samples.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects on vascular tone as a determinant of acute mountain sickness (AMS) after rapid ascent to high altitude. Method: Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2) and vascular tone, quantified by the reflection index (RI) obtained using photoplethysmography (PPG) technique, were studied over 3 days in 47 unacclimatized healthy subjects ascending from 495 to 3,658m. AMS occurrence was evaluated by the Lake Louise score system. Results: At 3,658m, two age groups demonstrated a significant decrease of SpO2 and a significant increase of HR in day 1 and showed gradual partial recovery in day 2 and day 3. We observed a mild increase in both SBP and DBP, and the increase was a little greater in the elderly and in subjects who developed AMS in both groups. RI fell during the first day in both age groups and got back towards normal in the following days. However subjects with AMS in both age groups showed a blunted and delayed response in RI to acute high-altitude exposure. Conclusions: The hypoxia driven effects on RI associated with AMS could in part be explained by a short-term imbalance between local endothelial derived vasodilatation and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. The specific feature of RI may provide an important mechanistic insight into the differential effects of functional adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia or capacity to adapt.					luo, xiaomin/HNS-7206-2023																978-1-4673-8302-8				2015							103	107		10.1109/ITME.2015.79	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITME.2015.79													WOS:000380403800024

Hydrology and thermal regime of an ice-contact proglacial lake: Implications for stream temperature and lake evaporation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The formation of lakes as glaciers retreat can potentially influence stream temperature and enhance catchment water losses via evaporation. This study quantified the summer water and energy budgets and thermal regime of an ice-contact proglacial lake below Bridge Glacier, British Columbia, to link ongoing glacier retreat with downstream effects. The ice-proximal and distal portions of the lake behave differently due to a mid-lake recessional moraine, against which icebergs are pinned by the dominant katabatic wind. Iceberg cover of the ice-proximal basin ranged from 16% to 75%. Temperature profiles in the ice-proximal basin were dominantly near-isothermal at 1 to 1.4 degrees C, with the exception of diurnal warming of the top 1 m of water and the presence of a colder layer near the lake bed at some sites, presumably caused by subglacial discharge of turbid water. Subaqueous iceberg melt limited warming by consuming heat from the water column. The distal basin exhibited varying degrees of thermal stratification, with turbidity inferred to have a greater influence on water density than temperature. Most of the warming between lake inflow and outflow occurred in the distal basin, where net radiation was the dominant surface energy input and net lateral advection the dominant energy sink. As a result of the suppressed water temperature, humidity gradients over the lake favoured condensation, not evaporation. Estimates of iceberg melt volume for 2013 exceeded glacier discharge into the lake. Therefore, when the glacier eventually becomes land-terminating, icebergs are expected to disappear within a year, resulting in higher water temperatures both in the lake and downstream. Higher lake temperatures could also cause an eventual shift from condensation to evaporation, which would tend to reduce catchment water yield over and above reductions associated with loss of glacier area.					; Moyer, Alexis/AAA-2245-2021	Bird, Lawrence/0000-0001-6541-2768; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR	2022	36	4							e14566	10.1002/hyp.14566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14566													WOS:000787734800005
J	Elliott, JA; May, L				Elliott, J. Alex; May, Linda			The sensitivity of phytoplankton in Loch Leven (UK) to changes in nutrient load and water temperature	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Loch Leven is a shallow, eutrophic lake in Scotland, U.K. It has experienced much change over the 30 years that it has been studied; this has primarily been due to reduced nutrient loads to the lake through active catchment management. Its recovery has been slow and, therefore, we used a phytoplankton community model (PROTECH) to test its sensitivity to changing nutrient loads and water temperature. 2. PROTECH was initialized to simulate the observed phytoplankton community in 1995 and was then repeatedly run through a combination of step-wise changes in water temperature and nutrient load (two treatments were simulated for nutrient load: one changing both nitrate and phosphorus, and one changing just phosphorus). The effect on total chlorophyll-a concentration, cyanobacteria abundance and phytoplankton diversity was examined. 3. Whilst changes in temperature had little effect, variations in the nutrient load produced a range of responses. Increasing only the phosphorus load caused a large increase in Anabaena abundance and total chlorophyll-a concentration. However, the opposite response was recorded when nitrate load was changed as well, with Anabaena increasing its biomass under reduced nutrient load scenarios. 4. The key factor determining the type of response appeared to be nitrogen availability. Anabaena, a nitrogen fixer, could exploit the phosphorus resource of Loch Leven under limiting nitrogen conditions, allowing it to dominate under most of the scenarios tested apart from those supplying extra nitrogen to the lake. The model predictions agree with the observed data, which show that Anabaena continues to dominate the summer phytoplankton bloom in Loch Leven despite the considerable reduction in phosphorus supply from the catchment. This research provides a possible explanation for this.

The 138 takes, extensively surveyed during summer 2000 as part of the European Project EMERGE (EVK1-CT-1999-00032) and a regional project in the eastern Alps, cover a relatively wide range of morphological, chemical and nutrient gradients. Principal Component Analysis identified geography (and related variables, such as ice cover duration and water temperature) and catchment geology as responsible for the major environmental gradients in the lakes Studied. The phytoplankton assemblages were found to be diverse, although mostly dominated by flagellates (chrysophytes, dinoflagellates and cryptophytes). Non motile green algae were quantitatively less important, with the exception of the Finnish lakes. Canonical Correspondence Analysis separated lakes located in Finnish Lapland from those in the Eastern Alps, based mainly on geographical location and related variables. Two minor satellite lake clusters located in the SW Alps and Rita Mountains were observed based on nitrogen level in the lakes and vegetation cover in the catchment, respectively. Different phytoplankton species composition and functionality characterised each lake cluster. Three key algal groups were outlined, which could be used for the ecological characterisation of remote mountain takes, i.e. Conjugatophyceae (exclusive to the high latitude Finnish lakes), Dinophyceae (exclusive to the Eastern Alps) and Chrysophyceae (widely distributed in the lakes surveyed and ranked in at least four different functional groups).

J	HAYES, JW				HAYES, JW			IMPORTANCE OF STREAM VERSUS EARLY LAKE REARING FOR RAINBOW-TROUT FRY IN LAKE-ALEXANDRINA, SOUTH-ISLAND, NEW-ZEALAND, DETERMINED FROM OTOLITH DAILY GROWTH-PATTERNS	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Otolith daily growth increment patterns were used to discriminate between early life-history patterns of 0+ rainbow trout and to determine the contribution of each to adult recruitment. Inlet stream residents had narrow increments (2.13-3.18 mu m) and Outlet Creek residents generally had wide increments (3.63-4.26 mu m) across the entire otolith radius. The dominant otolith growth pattern in lake juveniles comprised narrow increments before emergence (3.23-3.66 mu m) with wide increments (4.34 mu m) soon after emergence. This ''early lake migrant'' pattern was consistent with incubation in cool inlet streams followed by emigration to the warmer lake upon emergence. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) using mean increment widths at 50, 150, and 200 mu m from the primordia discriminated between these patterns (78% overall classification success; 96.5% for inlet stream residents, 60.0% for Outlet Creek residents, 77.0% for early lake migrants). Estimated proportions:(from DFA) of the early life-history types in the adult population were 28% inlet stream residents, 17% Outlet Creek residents, and 55% early lake migrants. Assuming daily formation of growth increments, mean fork length and mean number of days after emergence that early lake migrants entered the lake was 25.8 (+/- 1.1) mm and 1.4 (+ 6.4) days, respectively. Inlet stream residents appeared to emerge earlier in the spring and have higher survival than early lake migrants.																			0028-8330					SEP	1995	29	3					409	420		10.1080/00288330.1995.9516675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1995.9516675													WOS:A1995TH63000012
J	Glova, GJ; Jellyman, DJ				Glova, GJ; Jellyman, DJ			Size-related differences in diel activity of two species of juvenile eel (Anguilla) in a laboratory stream	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The diel activity of three size groups (small=<100 mm; medium=100-199 mm; large=200-299 mm total length) of juvenile short-finned ("shortfin") eels (Anguilla australis) and longfinned ("longfin") eels (A. dieffenbachii) was tested in a laboratory flow tank over a 48-h period during summer. All size groups of both species were nocturnally active, with the eels hiding in the substratum during the day and coming out on top of the cobbles from dusk to dawn, to feed. During the foraging period, the numbers and activity of all sizes of longfins visible were greater than those seen of shortfins, with the differences being more pronounced for small and medium eels. The activity of all eels consisted mostly of foraging by crawling, searching and probing for prey among the cobbles. Rate of activity increased with size of eel for both species. Small eels of either species did more swimming than eels of the larger sizes, whereas large eels were observed more frequently with only their head out of the substrate than were the smaller individuals. Feeding of small eels within the interstitial spaces of the streambed may explain their significantly lower activity on top of the substrate at night. The significantly lower rate of activity recorded for shortfins than longfins of all sizes may be due partly to their ability to feed within the interstices of the stream bed, and (or) longer time to recover from handling and habituate to the test environment.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2000	9	4					210	218		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2000.eff090403.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2000.eff090403.x													WOS:000165617000003

The fraction of the DOM pool that interacts with sunlight, referred to as chromophoric dissolved organic matter, impacts the optical properties of surface waters. Second source of H2O2 is wet and dry deposition of photogenerated substance in the atmosphere and biological production. The study examined the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in water from the surface microlayer (SM) (<100 mu m) and subsurface water (SSW) (25 cm) in the typical eutrophic (TOC 5-15 mg dm(-3); chlorophyll 5-26 mu g dm(-3), water transparency 0.6-1.0 m) lake as well as the impact of this compound on occurrence and survivorship of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria isolated and cultured on the TSA medium (Difco). The experimental H2O2 concentrations ranged between 500-5000 nM. The concentration of H2O2 in analyzed water samples clearly increased in day-time hours and was different in May, July and October. The highest natural concentration of H2O2 (700 nM) was observed in SM water in summer in afternoon hours. During that period, 100% of bacterial populations found in SM water produced catalase. The experiments confirmed that environmental concentrations of H2O2 caused no considerable decrease in survivorship of culturable bacteria, while concentrations exceeding 1000 nM were lethal for the majority of catalase-negative bacteria, but not for catalase-positive bacteria.

J	Lytle, DE				Lytle, DE			Palaeoecological evidence of state shifts between forest and barrens on a Michigan sand plain, USA	HOLOCENE												Recent disturbances have induced state shifts in many ecosystems. It has been proposed that human actions degrade system resilience, thus allowing state changes to occur more easily. Unless system dynamics in the absence of human influence are understood, however, we can not address two fundamental questions: are human actions producing dynamics that were previously absent in those systems? Or, are human actions simply replacing natural drivers of change in systems susceptible to state shifts? I use fossil pollen and charcoal to document Holocene vegetation and disturbance dynamics on a sand plain in Michigan to evaluate a recent anthropogenic state shift from forest to a barrens plant community. A 10 500-yr pollen record shows that a community similar to the modern barrens was present three times between 9000 and 5000 yr BP. These periods coincide with distinct peaks in the charcoal record, linking the barrens vegetation community and fire. The barrens vegetation community is thus a rare component of the Kingston Plain system, associated with both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. However, with no evidence of barrens vegetation during the last 5000 years, it appears that climate is also an important driver of vegetation change on the Kingston Plain. Ancient barrens occurred when annual precipitation was lower than current climate, and summer temperatures were warmer than current climate. Projections of decreased soil moisture and warmer temperatures in the Great Lakes region during the next century may thus imply decreased resilience of Great Lakes forests to future disturbances.																			0959-6836					NOV	2005	15	6					821	836		10.1191/0959683605hl856ra	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl856ra													WOS:000231527900005

A simple approach to quantifying whole-lake methane ebullition and sedimentary methane production, and its application to the Canadian Lake Pulse dataset	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Aquatic sediments represent a key component for understanding CH4 dynamics and emission to the atmosphere. Once produced in the sediments, CH4 is released either by diffusion at the sediment-water interface or by bubbling out to the atmosphere when total gas pressure in the sediment exceeds local ambient pressure due to high CH4 production. Although bubbling is one of the dominant CH4 emission pathways in lakes, direct measurements of this flux are hampered by its high spatiotemporal variability and methodological limitations. Here, we develop a conceptual approach to quantify CH(4 )production in lake sediments and particularly its release as bubbles based on simple measurements of bubble gas content and depth. Its main assumptions were empirically tested using > 200 long-term bubble trap deployments collected from 4 temperate lakes. We then applied the developed methodology to a suite of 408 Canadian lakes to produce the first standardized large-scale assessment of lakes CH4 ebullitive flux during summer. Our results show that lake sediments produced CH4 at a median rate of 3.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (ranged from 0.2 to 11.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), releasing 33% via ebullition to the atmosphere. These rates are remarkably similar in magnitude to other regional estimates in the literature. Moreover, our approach revealed that catchment slope was an important determinant of both the lake-wide ebullitive fluxes and the fraction of sediment CH4 production released as bubbles.

J	Cyterski, MJ; Ney, JJ				Cyterski, MJ; Ney, JJ			Availability of clupeid prey to primary piscivores in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Prey supply to predators is limited by the morphology, behavior, and spatial distributions of both predator and prey. To be eaten, prey must co-occur spatially and temporally with the predator (distribution), the predator must recognize the prey as potential food and successfully capture it (behavior), and the predator must have a mouth large enough to ingest its target (morphology). We quantified the cumulative effect of these three factors on clupeid prey availability to both largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and striped bass Morone saxatilis in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia. As expected, morphological constraints were more severe for small predators. Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus were morphologically more available than gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum. Incongruent spatial distributions, the result of lake stratification, prevented striped bass from feeding on gizzard shad during summer and limited largemouth bass consumption of alewives. For unknown behavioral reasons, largemouth bass and striped bass consumed only clupeids between 40 and 160 mm total length. For largemouth bass, the available supply of alewives was equivalent to demand and that of gizzard shad exceeded consumption by 53%. For striped bass, the available supply of gizzard shad surpassed consumption by 26% and that of alewives was 4% greater than consumption. Annual consumption by all clupeid predators, including largemouth bass and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, striped bass, walleye Sander vitreus, flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, white catfish Ameiurus catus, and crappies Pomoxis spp., was 94% of the total available clupeid supply. Our analysis indicates that increased predation on the clupeid forage base of Smith Mountain Lake would lead to decreased prey production and produce prey shortages for piscivores that are dependent on this food resource.

The distribution and abundance of Dreissena species (Dreissenidae) in Lake Erie, 2002	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A lake-wide benthic survey of Lake Erie during summer 2002 indicated that Dreissena bugensis is the dominant dreissenid in Lake Erie, especially in the east basin where this species was found at every station but no Dreissena polymorpha were collected. Mean (+/- SD) densities of dreissenid mussels were comparable between the west (601 +/- 2,110/m(2); n = 49) and central (635 +/- 1,293/m(2); n = 41) basins, but were much greater in the east basin (9,480 +/- 11,173/m(2); n = 17). The greater variability in mussel density among stations and replicate samples in the central and west basins than in the east basin is attributable to the preponderance of fine-grained substrata in the nearshore, higher episodic rates of sediment deposition, and periodic hypoxia in bottom waters. Although there was little change in lake-wide mean dreissenid densities between 1992 and 2002 (declining from ca. 2,636 individuals/m(2) to 2,025 individuals/m(2)), basin-averaged shell-free dry tissue mass increased by almost four-fold from ca. 6.8 +/- 15.6 g/m(2) to 24.7 +/- 71.3 g/m(2) in the same interval. Up to 90% of this biomass is in the eastern basin. Other changes in 2002 include the virtual absence of mussels in the 3 to 12 mm size range, probably because of predation by round gobies, and an increase in the average size of mature mussels. The substantial changes observed between 1992 and 2002 suggest that dreissenid populations in Lake Erie were still changing rapidly in abundance and biomass, as well as species composition. The results of this survey suggest that a direct link between Dreissena spp. and hypolimnetic hypoxia in the central basin is unlikely.

Adult osprey feathers were sampled from three Great Lakes study areas in 1991. Feathers sampled from chicks (approximately 28-35 days old) appear to be better indicators of local contaminant conditions since spatial patterns of mercury in known prey, yellow perch (Perca flavescens), also collected in these areas, were more similar to chick feathers than to eggs. Mercury levels were less variable in chick feathers than in eggs. Estimates of biomagnification factors using prey of known size at these areas were also less variable in feathers than in eggs. At naturally formed lakes, no significant correlation in mercury levels between eggs and chick feathers from the same nest was apparent, suggesting that the source of mercury contamination was not the same in these two tissues: mercury levels in eggs reflect mercury acquired on the breeding grounds, wintering grounds, and migratory route; mercury levels in chick feathers reflect local dietary conditions on the breeding grounds. Mercury levels in both osprey eggs and chick feathers were higher at the Ogoki Reservoir than at naturally formed lakes. Adult osprey feathers had higher mercury concentrations than chick feathers. Mercury levels in osprey eggs, chick feathers, and adult feathers did not approach levels associated with toxic reproductive effects.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				NOV	1997	33	4					441	452		10.1007/s002449900275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900275								9419264					WOS:000071159400013

Widespread freshwater carbonate in the Olduvai Basin, a precursor to a major eruption in the East African Rift System	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												Freshwater limestones are uncommon in the sedimentary record of the East African Rift System. Recent research in the Olduvai Basin, Tanzania has revealed an extensive carbonate unit ca 1.8 Ma in age that varies spatially in thickness, petrography, trace element and rare earth geochemistry, C and O isotope values and freshwater microfossils. Five distinct lithologies are recognized. Four reflect deposition in carbonate-rich environments that occurred at the same time in a catena-like pattern over a heterogeneous landscape: spring, wetland, freshwater lake/pond and saline playa lake. The fifth is carbonate nodular soil that formed by paedogenesis on areas of topographically higher terrane. The delta O-18 of the carbonate, as negative as -6.5 parts per thousand, indicates that the groundwater is meteoritic derived. The origin of the carbonate comprising this thick, extensive, isochronostratigraphic deposit has not been determined, but it is believed that carbonatite volcanism may have supplied elevated levels of carbonate to the basin which then entered the groundwater system. The carbonate was deposited just prior to a major trachyte-phonolite eruption of Mount Olmoti, and the deposition of a basin wide tuff, Tuff IF. The region is seismically active today and seismic events were likely associated with Olmoti volcanism. The widespread carbonate unit may have preceded the Olmoti eruption and formed from a recurring seismically induced increase in aquifer porosity and permeability. The carbonate-enriched groundwater episodically discharged onto the land surface, interacting locally with both fresh and saline ponded water.

J	Mankinen, EA; Wentworth, CM				Mankinen, Edward A.; Wentworth, Carl M.			Paleomagnetic record determined in cores from deep research wells in the Quaternary Santa Clara basin, California	GEOSPHERE												Paleomagnetic study of cores from six deep wells provides an independent temporal framework for much of the alluvial stratigraphy of the Quaternary basin beneath the Santa Clara Valley. This stratigraphy consists of 8 upward-fining cycles in the upper 300 m of section and an underlying 150 m or more of largely fine-grained sediment. The eight cycles have been correlated with the marine oxygen isotope record, thus providing one means of dating the section. The section has also proved to contain a rich paleomagnetic record despite the intermittent sedimentation characteristic of alluvial environments. Each well was designed to reach a depth of similar to 300 m, although 2 were terminated at shallower depth where bedrock was encountered and one (GUAD) was deepened to bedrock at 407.2 m. Cores were taken at intermittent intervals in most of the wells, composing similar to 20%-25% of their depths. In GUAD an attempt was made to core the entire upper 300 m, with core recovery of 201.8 m (67%). The paleomagnetic framework ranges from the 32 ka Mono Lake excursion near the top of the second sedimentary cycle to below the 780 ka Brunhes-Matuyama geomagnetic reversal beneath the eighth cycle. These ages nicely fit those assigned to the section based on correlation with the marine oxygen isotope record. Several episodes of anomalous magnetic inclinations were also found within the cyclic section in some of the wells. Some of the episodes of anomalous magnetic inclinations are only separated by short normal intervals in a pattern similar to that described for some well-documented excursions. We consider that a geomagnetic excursion was likely only if the anomalous inclinations were found at approximately the same stratigraphic position in more than one drill hole. A deeper time constraint is provided by the upper boundary (990 ka) of the Jaramillo Normal Polarity Subchron recognized at a depth of 302 m in one deeply penetrating well (GUAD). Approximately 100 m of normal Jaramillo section is evident below that in wells GUAD and EVGR. The reversal that we identify as the 780 ka Brunhes-Matuyama boundary, found at depths of 291-303 m in three wells, indicates an average rate of deposition in this upper section of similar to 37 cm/k.y. In GUAD, the top of the underlying normally polarized section, which we assign to the upper part of the Jaramillo Normal Polarity Subchron, was found between 301.8 and 304.5 m. The resultant 10 m of reversed polarity section above the Jaramillo seems anomalously short for this 210 k.y. part of the Matuyama Chron, during which several times that thickness of section probably should have accumulated. This observation indicates that a significant unconformity should be present in that short section between the Jaramillo Subchron and the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary. Deeper cores in two wells (GUAD and EVGR) all have normal polarity and seem to represent much of the Jaramillo Subchron, although no base for that subchron was found. The resultant minimum rate of sedimentation for this lower section beneath the unconformity is 170 cm/k.y. The Mono Lake (ca. 32 ka), Pringle Falls (ca. 210 ka), and Big Lost (ca. 565 ka) geomagnetic excursions all seem to be represented in the Santa Clara Valley wells. Possible correlations to the Laschamp (ca. 40 ka) and Blake (ca. 110 ka) excursions are also noted. Three additional excursions that have apparently not been previously reported from western North America occur within cycle 6 (between 536 and 433 ka), near the base of cycle 5 (after 433 ka), and near the middle of cycle 2 (before ca. 75 ka).

J	Wright, DT; Wacey, D				Wright, DT; Wacey, D			Precipitation of dolomite using sulphate-reducing bacteria from the Coorong Region, South Australia: significance and implications	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Dolomite was successfully precipitated in culture experiments that simulated microbiogeochemical conditions prevailing during late stages of evaporation in ephemeral, hypersaline dolomitic lakes of the Coorong region, South Australia. Analyses of lake- and pore-water samples document rapid geochemical changes with time and depth in both dolomitic and non-dolomitic lakes. Extremely high sulphate and magnesium ion concentrations in lake waters decline rapidly with depth in pore waters throughout the sulphate-reduction zone, whereas carbonate concentrations in pore waters reach levels up to 100 times those of normal sea water. Ultimately, sulphate is totally consumed and no solid sulphate is recorded in the dolomitic lake sediments. ' Most probable number ' calculations of lake sediment samples record the presence of large populations of sulphate-reducing bacteria, whereas sulphur-isotope analyses of lake-water samples indicate microbial fractionation in all the lakes studied. Viable populations of microbes from the lake sediments were cultured in anoxic conditions in the laboratory. Samples were then injected into vials containing sterilized clastic or carbonate grains, or glass beads, immersed in a solution that simulated the lake water. Falls in the levels of sulphate and rising pH in positive vials were interpreted as indicating active bacterial sulphate reduction accompanied by increased concentrations of carbonate. Within 2 months, sub-spherical, sub-micron-size crystals of dolomite identical to those of lake sediments were precipitated. It is concluded that bacterial sulphate reduction overcomes kinetic constraints on dolomite formation by removing sulphate and releasing magnesium and calcium ions from neutral ion pairs, and by generating elevated carbonate concentrations, in a hypersaline, strongly electrolytic solution. The results demonstrate that bacterial sulphate reduction controls dolomite precipitation in both the laboratory experiments and lake sediments. It is proposed that dolomite formation, through bacterial sulphate reduction, provides a process analogue applicable to thick platformal dolostones of the past, where benthic microbial communities were the sole or dominant colonizers of shallow marine environments.

J	Murry, BA; Farrell, JM				Murry, Brent A.; Farrell, John M.			Resistance of the size structure of the fish community to ecological perturbations in a large river ecosystem	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Frequency distributions of log-scaled abundance and body size for aquatic biota, including fish, yield size spectra that provide gross estimates of food-web capacity (number of individuals supported by the food web indexed by the midpoint height or y-intercept) and ecological efficiency (rate of decreasing organismal abundance with increasing body size as indicated by the size-spectra slope). 2. Size spectra are known to respond in predictable fashion to exploitation by commercial (marine) fisheries, but there has been relatively little research of size spectra in freshwater systems and less evaluation of how community size-structure responds to the wider array of ecological perturbations prevalent in freshwater systems. 3. We used a 29-year experimental gillnet data set to test the responses of food-web capacity and ecological efficiency (as indexed by size spectra) of a large river fish community to variations in predatory demand (population expansion of double-crested cormorant, Phalacrocorax auritus) and perturbations affecting primary production (reductions in total phosphorus and warming summer water temperature). 4. Fish community capacity (size-spectra elevation) and ecological efficiency (size-spectra slope) showed low interannual variation (coefficients of variation 5.6 and 15.4%, respectively). Though highly stable, food-web capacity decreased over time concurrent with declining total phosphorus concentrations and increasing cormorant abundance. Interannual variation in ecological efficiency was not related to the measured perturbations. 5. Relative abundance of the core species that comprised 95% of the community remained relatively consistent over time. The fish community size-structure was also stable and resistant to ecological perturbation. However, we found measurable changes in the composition of secondary species, and these were associated with an increase in cormorant abundance and decrease in total phosphorus. The lack of change in core community species representation and in overall size structure suggest community-level compensatory mechanisms were operating.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2014	59	1					155	167		10.1111/fwb.12255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12255													WOS:000328225500013

Breeding displacement in gray wolves (Canis lupus): Three males usurp breeding position and pup rearing from a neighboring pack in Yellowstone National Park	PLOS ONE												Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) are territorial, group living carnivores that live in packs typically consisting of a dominant breeding pair and their offspring. Breeding tenures are relatively short and competitive, with vacancies usually occurring following a breeder's death, and are often filled by unrelated immigrants or by relatives of the previous breeder. The frequency and conditions of active breeder displacements are poorly understood. Position changes in the dominance hierarchy are common yet rarely documented in detail. We describe a male breeding position turnover in a wolf pack by males from a neighboring pack in mid-summer 2016 in Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of two months, three males from the Mollie's pack displaced the breeding male of the neighboring Wapiti Lake pack, joined the pack's two adult females, and subsequently raised the previous male's four approximately three-month old pups. In the five years following the displacement (2017 to 2021), at least one of the intruding males has successfully bred with the dominant female and most years with a subordinate female (who was one of the pups at the time of displacement). The pack reared pups to adulthood each year. Male breeding displacements are likely influenced by male-male competition and female mate choice. These changes are the result of individuals competing to improve breeding position and may lead to increased pack stability and greater reproductive success. We report in detail on the behavior of a closely observed breeding displacement and we discuss the adaptive benefits of the change.

This study examines the impact of the abandoned Ze & iuml;da lead mine on water sources in the Upper Moulouya region of northwestern Morocco. We aimed to evaluate water quality, understand geochemical processes, and determine the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation. In summer 2021, 21 water samples were collected from rivers, dams, groundwater, and quarry lakes. We analyzed 18 physicochemical and metallic parameters, finding significant variations in ion concentrations. The main ions were ranked as Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-. Metal concentrations followed the order Zn > Cu > Pb > As > Cd. The Drinking Water Quality Index (DWQI) showed that 95% of the samples were not suitable for drinking. Similarly, the Irrigation Water Quality Indexes (IWQIs) indicated that quarry lakes were unsuitable for irrigation, while groundwater met acceptable criteria. Over 70% of the samples showed no significant metal contamination based on the Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI) and Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI). The data suggest that water-rock interactions are the main drivers of hydrochemical changes, with processes like calcite, dolomite, otavite, and cerussite precipitation, as well as the weathering of minerals like halite, starkeyite, and sylvite. To protect water quality and prevent environmental damage, ongoing monitoring and appropriate measures are recommended for the Ze & iuml;da mining area.

J	Patterson, SD; Scarnecchia, DL; Congleton, JL				Patterson, Scott D.; Scarnecchia, Dennis L.; Congleton, James L.			Sexual maturation in kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												We used observational and experimental approaches to obtain information on factors affecting the timing of maturation of kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, a semelparous, landlocked salmon. Gonadal staging criteria were developed and applied to three kokanee populations in Idaho lakes and reservoirs. Testes were classified into three stages: immature (stage one, S1), maturing (S2), and mature (S3). Ovaries were classified into eight stages: immature (S1-S3), transitional (stage S4), maturing (S5-S7), and mature (S8). Males entered the maturing stage (S2) in February through April of the spawning year. Females entered maturing stage (S5) as early as July of the year before the spawning year, and as late as March of the spawning year. Three hatchery experiments demonstrated that attainment of a larger body size 10 to 16 months before spawning increased the likelihood of initiation of maturation in both sexes. No gonads in a state of regression were observed. A gonadosomatic index above 0.1 by early July was a food indicator of a maturing male, and a gonadosomatic index above 1.0 by early July was a good indicator of a maturing female. Instantaneous growth rates were not good predictors of maturation, but attaining a size threshold of 18 to 19 cm in the fall was a food predictor of maturation the following year. This improved knowledge of kokanee maturation will permit more effectively management of the species for age, growth and size at maturity as well as for contributions to fisheries.

Four main periods of groundwater- and lake-level movements and related environmental changes can be identified. (1) 12,500-10,200 yrs B.P. (lake stage): very rapid rise of the groundwater table of about 2 to 3 m, resulting in a shallow lake, followed by a more gradual rise of about 2.5 to 1.5 m. (2) 10,200-7000 yrs B.P. (freshwater marsh, stage 1): slow overall rise of the water table interrupted by a drop of at least 1 m between about 9500 and 9000 yrs B.P. and of at least 0.8 m between about 8000 and 7500 yrs B.P., each event leading to oxidation and maceration of organic material. (3) 7000-6400 yrs B.P. (complete desiccation of the swamp): rapid fall of the water table of at least 3.9 m, causing large-scale down-wasting of the accumulated peat. (4) After 6400 yrs B.P. (freshwater marsh, stage 2): rapid rise of the water table. The water-table rise of period 1 and the lowering of period 3 are attributed to predominantly local causes, while the groundwater fluctuations during period 2 are probably climate-related. The final water-level increase reflects the influence of Holocene relative sea-level rise.

Dynamic nutrient removal potential of R. rotundifolia was estimated using the Eco-tank system simulating natural eutrophic waters. The growth and physiological response of R. rotundifolia by cutting and division propagation to light (100%, 60%, and 20% natural light) were investigated. The results showed that R. rotundifolia was superior in removing N and P from eutrophic waters. As influent concentrations of NH4+-N and total phosphorus (TP) were 4.81-5.87 and 0.61-0.78 mg L-1, effluent concentrations of NH4+-N, total nitrogen (TN), and TP were separately 0.06-1.10, 0.40-1.59, and 0.05-0.17 mg L-1, with removal efficiencies of 93.6%, 84.6%, and 82.5% at a flow rate of 200 L d-1. The growth and morphology of the plant under two propagation patterns were influenced by light and the responses were quite different. The biomass of the plant by cutting was higher at low light conditions, and the plant allocated more biomass on above ground. However, there was no significant difference in the height. By division, the plant preferred to high light. The biomass and height were significantly higher at 100% natural light. The peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and root activities of plant by cutting showed a trend of decrease and followed by an increase with light reduction, while by division, they increased with reduced light available. Variations of chlorophyll and soluble protein of the plant by cutting and division were contrary to the changes of POD activity. These results suggest that R. rotundifolia can be used to effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus in eutrophic waters, and high light promotes the growth of the plant by division, while suitable shade is needed for the plant by cutting.

J	Perakis, SS; Welch, EB; Jacoby, JM				Perakis, SS; Welch, EB; Jacoby, JM			Sediment-to-water blue-green algal recruitment in response to alum and environmental factors	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The sediment-to-water recruitment of blue-green algae was investigated in a shallow lake following treatment with aluminum sulfate and sodium aluminate to control sediment phosphorus (P) release. A comparison of results from two summers each before and after treatment indicates that the treatment did not universally impact the recruitment of either sporulating or non-sporulating forms of blue-green algae. Blooms of Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Coelosphaerium resulted predominantly from growth in the water column following strong recruitment episodes lasting up to two weeks, while Microcystis populations were relatively insensitive to periodically high inputs from recruitment. The development of planktonic populations of Gloeotrichia echinulata, by contrast, were largely dependent on sustained recruitment in response to adequate light and temperature regimes at the sediment surface. The cellular P content of recruited G. echinulata colonies was unaffected by the accumulation of aluminum flee to the lake sediments. Both C. echinulata and C. naegelianum showed elevated levels of cellular P in newly recruited colonies as compared to planktonic colonies, indicating P transport from the sediments to the water column. Total P translocation by blue-green algae was negligible in the absence of a substantial recruitment of G. echinulata. The recruitment of G. echinulata, and hence the magnitude of P translocation, was therefore more responsive to environmental conditions prevalent at the sediments than to direct effects of the treatment itself.

J	Mari, X; Rassoulzadegan, F				Mari, X; Rassoulzadegan, F			Role of TEP in the microbial food web structure. I. Grazing behavior of a bacterivorous pelagic ciliate	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We studied the ingestion of picoplankton-size particles by the oligotrich Strombidium sulcatum as a function of transparent exopolymeric particle (TEP) concentration. Fluorescent microspheres of 1 mum (FMS) were used as prey-item analogs. TEP-FMS aggregates were formed by bubbling seawater solutions containing different TEP concentrations in the presence of FMS. After bubbling, concentrations of TEP-FMS aggregates ranged from 0.5 to 1.7 ppm and from 11.9 to 17.9 ppm in the low and high TEP treatments, respectively. When the ciliates were exposed to similar FMS concentrations, but different TEP concentrations, ingestion rates were higher for the low TEP treatments (14.1 FMS ciliate(-1) h(-1)) than for the high TEP treatments (5.2 FMS ciliate(-1) h(-1)). The number of FMS ingested in the low TEP treatments was 2.7 times higher than in the high TEP treatments and ingestion rates were inversely correlated to TEP volume concentration. Our results suggest that the formation of TEP-FMS reduces FMS availability for micro-grazers by modifying the food size spectra and redistributing FMS to larger size classes, and that at a critical TEP concentration picoplankton-size prey items may become unavailable for the ciliate S. sulcatum, while concomitantly they may become available for large-particle grazers. Therefore, one role of TEP in the microbial food web would be to act as a trophic elevator, thus creating a direct lift for picoplankton-size prey items to higher trophic levels.

We assessed climate variability in the region and through time using multiproxy data comprising biotic and abiotic proxies. Mangrove and its associate assemblages suggest a backwater estuarine environment between similar to 7.8 and 6 ka B.P. Depleted delta(13) C-org values during similar to 7.8 to 5.5 ka B.P. indicate dominance of C-3 vegetation, suggesting a warmer climate and strengthened monsoon. Enhanced delta C-13(org) and absence of pollen/spores are observed in the sediment layers deposited after similar to 5 ka B.P., indicating arid climatic conditions with a dominance of C-4 photosynthesizing plants and a relative lowering of sea level. Paleodenudation rates estimated using Be-10((meteoric))/ Be-9 ratios varied between 556 +/- 35 to 242 +/- 15 t.km(-2).yr(-1). Phases of intense denudation occurred during 7.8-6.7 and 2.2-1 ka B.P., corresponding to Holocene Climatic Optimum and Medieval Climatic Anomaly, respectively. The degree of chemical weathering appears to have gradually increased from the early to late Holocene and correlates well (negatively) with the denudation rate. A gradual increase in the degree of chemical weathering from the early to late Holocene suggests an increase in the residence time of minerals in the weathering zone as the monsoon weakened.

Seismic and geodetic evidence for grounding-line control of Whillans Ice Stream stick-slip events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The tidally modulated, stick-slip events of Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica produce seismic energy from three locations near the grounding line. Using ice velocity records obtained by combining time series from colocated broadband seismometers and GPS receivers installed on the ice stream during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 austral summers, along with far-field seismic recordings of elastic waves, we locate regions of high rupture velocity and stress drop. These regions, which are analogous to asperities in traditional seismic fault studies, are areas of elevated friction at the base of the ice stream. Slip events consistently initiate at one of two locations: near the center of the ice stream, where events associated with the Ross Sea high tide originate, or a grounding-line spot, where events associated with the Ross Sea low tide initiate, as well as occasional high-tide events following a skipped low-tide event. The grounding-line site, but not the central site, produces Rayleigh waves observable up to 1000km away, through fast expansion of the slip area. Grounding-line initiation events also show strong directivity in the downstream direction, indicating initial rupture propagation at 1.5km/s, compared to an average of 0.150km/s for the entire slip event. Following slip initiation, additional seismic energy is produced from two sources located near the grounding line: first at the downstream end of Subglacial Lake Engelhardt and second toward the farthest downstream extent of the ice stream. This evidence suggests that the stronger, higher-friction material along the grounding line controls motion throughout the stick-slip region.

J	Reddy, MM; Hoch, A				Reddy, Michael M.; Hoch, Anthony			Calcium Carbonate Nucleation in an Alkaline Lake Surface Water, Pyramid Lake, Nevada, USA	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Calcium concentration and calcite supersaturation (Omega) needed for calcium carbonate nucleation and crystal growth in Pyramid Lake (PL) surface water were determined during August of 1997, 2000, and 2001. PL surface water has Omega values of 10-16. Notwithstanding high Omega, calcium carbonate growth did not occur on aragonite single crystals suspended PL surface water for several months. However, calcium solution addition to PL surface-water samples caused reproducible calcium carbonate mineral nucleation and crystal growth. Mean PL surface-water calcium concentration at nucleation was 2.33 mM (n = 10), a value about nine times higher than the ambient PL surface-water calcium concentration (0.26 mM); mean Omega at nucleation (109 with a standard deviation of 8) is about eight times the PL surface-water Omega. Calcium concentration and Omega regulated the calcium carbonate formation in PL nucleation experiments and surface water. Unfiltered samples nucleated at lower Omega than filtered samples. Calcium concentration and Omega at nucleation for experiments in the presence of added particles were within one standard deviation of the mean for all samples. Calcium carbonate formation rates followed a simple rate expression of the form, rate (mM/min) = A (Omega) + B.

J	HUTTON, JM				HUTTON, JM			INCUBATION TEMPERATURES, SEX-RATIOS AND SEX DETERMINATION IN A POPULATION OF NILE CROCODILES (CROCODYLUS-NILOTICUS)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												A demographic study of the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus at Lake Ngezi, Zimbabwe, revealed that females predominated in all sizes classes and among embryos. The sex of C. niloticus was shown to be determined by the temperature of egg incubation in constant temperature laboratory experiments. At 31.degree. C and below only females were produced. The threshold temperature for maleness was between 31.degree. and 34.degree. C, but appeared to vary between clutches. The duration of the incubation period varied with temperature and was 110 days at 28.degree. C, falling to 85 days at 34.degree. C. Incubation temperature affected hatchling length, but not mass. Hatchlings from incubation at 34.degree. C were shorter on average than those from incubation at 28.degree. C and 31.degree. C, but by three months had outgrown them. There was no sex-related difference in length in a random sample of 200 two-year-old C. niloticus on a crocodile farm. Mean temperatures in wild nests were consistently lower than 31.degree. C and therefore the male threshold as determined in the laboratory. Embryonic development was slow and hatching success poor. The shallowest eggs in a nest had higher mean temperatures and more advanced embryos than the deepest eggs. They also experienced daily temperature fluctuations of up to 10.degree. C during which the maximum occasionally rose to 35.degree. C. Constant temperature incubation was not a good model of field conditions, but the correlation between nest temperatures and embryonic sex is consistent with temperature-dependent sex determination in the wild.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				JAN	1987	211		1				143	155		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1987.tb07458.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1987.tb07458.x													WOS:A1987G249700011

Berry; Warner, Nathaniel; Vengosh, Avner; Olesik, John; Welch, Kathleen; Deuerling, Kelly			Boron isotopic geochemistry of the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, Antarctica	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The geochemistry of boron was investigated in the ice-covered lakes and glacier meltwater streams within Taylor and Wright Valley of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM), Antarctica, in order to achieve a greater understanding of the source of boron to these aquatic systems and how in-lake processes control boron concentration. Selected lake depths (surface and bottom water) and streams were analyzed for boron geochemistry. Boron stable isotope values in these waters span the range of + 12.3 parts per thousand to + 51.4 parts per thousand, which corresponds to the variations from glacier meltwater streams to the hypolimnion of a highly evaporated hypersaline lake. The data demonstrate that the major sources of B to the aquatic system are via terrestrial chemical weathering of aluminosilicates within the stream channels, and a marine source, either currently being introduced by marine-derived aerosols or in the form of ancient seawater. Lakes Fryxell, Hoare, and upper waters of Lake Joyce, which experience more terrestrial influence of aluminosilicate chemical weathering via glacial meltwater streams, display a mixture of these two major sources, while the source of B in the bottom waters of Lake Joyce appears to be primarily of marine origin. Lakes Bonney and Vanda and the Blood Falls brine have a marine-like source whose delta B-11 values have become more positive by mineral precipitation and/or adsorption. Don Juan Pond displays a terrestrial aluminosilicate influence of a marine-like source. These hypersaline lake waters from Antarctica are similar in delta B-11 to other hypersaline lake waters globally, suggesting that similar processes control their B geochemistry.

This study explored the dose effects of calcium peroxide (CaO2) on inhibiting harmful gases emissions and restoring the scenic effect (including visual sense and olfactory sense) of anoxic/anaerobic landscape water system. The results indicated that the emissions of H2S, CO2 and CH4 from the anoxic/anaerobic water system were obviously inhibited in the reactors with CaO2 additions and the effect was positively correlated with the CaO2 dose. Meanwhile, the concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble sulfide (S2-), and turbidity in the overlying water (the water-layer above the sediment-water interface) were also decreased in the reactors dosed with CaO2. The reason was ascribed to the improvement of the anoxic/anaerobic condition in the water system and the increase of the species richness, bacteria count and aerobic microorganism abundance in sediment. Furthermore, 0.12 kg-CaO2 m(-2)-sediment was selected as the optimal dose, which was based on considering the inhibiting effect of the harmful gases emissions, comprehensive influence and costs. Compared with control check (CK, the reactor without adding CaO2), the optimal dose of CaO2 could reduce 75.10% CH4, 81.02% CO2 and 100% H2S in gases, and decrease 81.52% S2-, 42.85% TCOD and 84.01% turbidity in the overlying water. In conclusion, all the dosages of CaO2 could improve the anoxic condition of water system and 0.12 kg-CaO2 m(-2)-sediment was the optimal dose in inhibiting harmful gases emissions, which could keep an excellent water quality in this simulation experiment. Therefore, this study may provide a feasible method and the optimal dose for inhibiting the emissions of harmful gases and restoring the scenic effect in the similar anoxic/anaerobic landscape water.

In this study, we first determined the water budget and then estimated nutrient loading from an upland farm field into a 1.5 ha, kettle-block peatland. The wetland contains highly anisotropic pest and has no distinct, active layer of groundwater flow. We estimated the depth of the active layer using Fick's law of diffusion and quantified groundwater flow using a chemical mass balance model. Evapotranspiration was determined using MORECS, a semi-physical model based on the Penman-Monteith approach. Precipitation and surface outflow were measured using physical means. Groundwater provided the major inflow, 84 percent (44,418 m(3)) in 1993 and 88 percent (68,311 m(3)) in 1994. Surface outflow represented 54 percent (28,763 m(3)) of total outflows in 1993 and 48 percent (37,078 m(3)) in 1994. A comparison of several published water budgets for wetlands and lakes showed that error estimates for hydrologic components in this study are well within the range of error estimates calculated in other studies. Groundwater inflow estimates and nutrient concentrations of three springs were used to estimate agricultural nutrient loading to the site. During the study period, nutrient loading into the peatland via groundwater discharge averaged 24.74 kg K ha(-1), 1.83 kg total inorganic P ha(-1), and 21.81 kg NO3-N ha(-1).																			1093-474X					AUG	1999	35	4					753	769		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04172.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04172.x													WOS:000082129200005

Foraging mechanisms of age-0 lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Reaction distances under various light intensities (0-19 uE/m2/s), angles of attack, swimming speeds, and percentage of overall foraging success were measured. Extensive efforts have been invested in restoring lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes, but successful natural recruitment of lake trout continues to be rare outside of Lake Superior and parts of Lake Huron. There is evidence of high mortality during the first several months after eggs hatch in the spring, but little is known about the foraging mechanisms of this age-0 life stage. We developed a foraging model for age-0 lake trout (S. namaycush) in response to amphipods (Hyalella azteca) and mysids (Mysis diluviana) by simulating underwater environmental conditions in the Great Lakes using a temperature-controlled chamber and spectrally matched lighting. Reaction distances under various light intensities (0-19 uE/m(2)/s), angles of attack, swimming speeds, and percentage of overall foraging success were measured. Intake rates under different light intensities and prey densities were also measured. Age-0 lake trout were non-responsive in the dark, but were equally responsive under all light levels tested. Age-0 lake trout also demonstrated a longer reaction distance in response to moving prey, particularly mysids, which had an escape response that reduced overall foraging success. We determined that prey intake rate (numeric or biomass) could be modeled most accurately as a function of prey density using a Michaelis-Menton equation and that even under low mysid densities (3 individuals/m(2)), age-0 lake trout could quickly satisfy their energetic demands in a benthic setting.

Tropical/subtropical wetlands have even more pronounced climatic and biological influences on the sediment dynamics. In the current study, a protected subtropical wetland in Bihar (India) has been assessed for its sedimentary and mineralogical status. Sediment characteristics and associated granulometric parameters are discussed to highlight the wetland's hydrogeomorphic character, energy dimension, and the depositional processes taking place. Statistical grain size parameters like graphic mean, graphic skewness, graphic kurtosis, and their interrelations studies have helped in understanding the sources of deposited materials. Multivariate statistics have identified, sand fractions, measures of central tendencies (mean, median, and mode), percent organic matter (%OM) and percent carbonates (%carbonates) as primary factors explaining the maximum variance in the data. The non-parametric KruskaleWallis test has identified %sand, %clay, electrical conductivity (EC), and %carbonates as the major factors responsible for significant spatial variability. The grain texture analysis shows that the majority of samples fall in the brackets of clayey silt; silty sand; and sand, silt, and clay. Common mineral components associated with these are quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, etc. The range for the mean grain size lies between 3F to 9F ( F is diameter of the sediments) where most of the grain size distributions are symmetrically to fine symmetrically skewed, indicating intermediate energy to adjust to environmental conditions. The granulometric and physicochemical characteristics of the sediment samples also indicate the directional distribution pattern of sediment along the hydrological pathway. Future studies concentrating on the fluvial discharges of water and sediment will be highly insightful in reconstructing the past net sediment accumulation processes in the Baraila Wetland.

J	Dzialowski, AR; O'Brien, WJ; Swaffar, SM				Dzialowski, AR; O'Brien, WJ; Swaffar, SM			Range expansion and potential dispersal mechanisms of the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Recently the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded freshwater systems throughout the southern and midwestern United States. We conducted regional surveys of eastern Kansas reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi. Daphnia lumholtzi was found in five of 35 reservoirs sampled in 1994, and 11 of the 35 reservoirs when re-sampled in 1997. In addition, we sampled 40 small ponds inaccessible to recreational boats, within the watershed of an invaded reservoir. We did not find D.lumholtzi in any of these ponds, suggesting that non-human dispersal mechanisms play an insignificant role in the range expansion of D.lumholtzi throughout the United States. Further experimentation, however, is needed to determine if the absence of D.lumholtzi from these small ponds is due to insufficient dispersal mechanisms or the inability of this invader to successfully colonize following arrival. Daphnia lumholtzi has broad limnological tolerances. However, invaded reservoirs tend to be larger in area, have higher Secchi disk depths, and lower total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a levels relative to non-invaded reservoirs. Analyses of pre-invasion zooplankton communities indicate that D.lumholtzi may be invading reservoirs in which native Daphnia species are rare. While the long-term effects of the invasion of D.lumholtzi are unknown, it has the potential to dominate late summer zooplankton communities in eastern Kansas reservoirs. Therefore, we need to continue to survey and monitor invaded reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi and determine the long-term implications of the introduction of this invader.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				DEC	2000	22	12					2205	2223		10.1093/plankt/22.12.2205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.12.2205													WOS:000166327800002
J	Winsemann, J; Asprion, U; Meyer, T				Winsemann, J; Asprion, U; Meyer, T			Sequence analysis of early Saalian glacial lake deposits (NW Germany): evidence of local ice margin retreat and associated calving processes	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												This paper presents a detailed analysis of high-resolution facies architecture of glaciolacustrine ice-margin deposits, which formed at the southern margin of the Scandinavian ice shield. The ice margin depositional systems are characterised by coarse-grained deltas and subaqueous fans, which are formed by stacked transgressive-regressive sequences, recording an overall lake transgression, interrupted by minor short-term lake-level Falls. The delta complexes at the northern margin of glacial Lake Rinteln are thought to reflect a relatively stable position of the ice margin in front of the Weser Chains mountain ridges. The onset of delta progradation probably represents a halt in ice advance and a related high sediment supply period. The sedimentary facies and depositional architecture resemble those of nonglacial Gilbert-type deltas, except for the deposition of glacial debris. The main delta progradation is recorded from the highstand systems tract, when high meltwater and sediment discharge occurred during the melt season. A forced regression during opening of outlets led to the formation of subaerially exposed sequence boundaries and the erosion of the highstand systems tract. Deeply incised channels (incised valleys) were filled during the subsequent transgression. At the eastern lake margin, subaqueous fan deposits reflect an unstable ice-front that was rapidly retreating and subject to periodic calving, which resulted in the generation of floating icebergs, clumping ice-rafted debris and ploughing into subaqueous fan deposits. The rapid retreat of this eastern ice margin is interpreted to result from the overall lake-level rise. The fan-stacking pattern and bulk geometry were determined by the ice-front fluctuations, the shifting of meltwater outlets and the short-term lake-level fluctuations. Depositional processes reflect the character of sediment supply and distance from the ice margin. Ice-proximal upper-fan deposits are characterised by coarse-grained gravel, deposited by debris flows that document continuous discharge. Slump and slide deposits are related to steep depositional slopes. The mid-fan contains basinward fining and thinning deposits of quasi-steady and surge-type high- and low-density turbidity currents, indicating more ice-distal and periodic deposition. The outer-fan deposits mainly consist of surge-type low-density turbidites and glacial debris dumped by icebergs. The forcing parameters governing the development of depositional sequences in both delta and fan settings were lake-level fluctuations, sediment yield rates and physiography. The depositional sequences were deposited on a time scale of seventh- and eighth-order high-frequency cycles (10(1) - 10(2) years). In this short time span, lake-level fluctuations were on the order of 120 m; therefore, accommodation space was largely controlled by lake level and subsidence can be ignored. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hilfinger, MF; Mullins, HT; Burnett, A; Kirby, ME				Hilfinger, MF; Mullins, HT; Burnett, A; Kirby, ME			A 2500 year sediment record from Fayetteville Green Lake, New York: evidence for anthropogenic impacts and historic isotope shift	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A series (N = 12) of short (< 1 m) sediment cores were collected from meromictic Green Lake in Fayetteville, New York to investigate potential anthropogenic impacts on the watershed during historic time and environmental change over the past similar to2,500 years. Stratigraphic data document an abrupt basinwide change during the early 1800's A.D. from brown laminated sediments to grey varved sediments separated by a transition zone rich in aquatic moss. Deforestation of the region by European settlers during the early 1800's A.D. resulted in a flux of nutrients and increased biological productivity followed by a 7-fold increase in sediment accumulation rates. Elemental geochemical data document the anthropogenic loading of lead to the to the lake basin via atmospheric fallout. Stable oxygen isotope (delta (18)O calcite) data also provide evidence for an abrupt shift in the isotopic composition of lake water similar to 150-200 years ago. This isotopic shift could have been a local phenomenon related to an increased supply of summer enriched precipitation following removal of forest vegetation, or it might have reflected broader scale climatic changes. We hypothesize that the delta (1)8O calcite shift was the result of the polar front jet stream migrating from a more southerly prehistoric position to a contracted, northerly configuration similar to 150-200 years ago. Such a shift could have been natural, associated with the end of the Little Ice Age or it may have been anthropogenically forced.

J	Tackman, GE; Bills, BG; James, TS; Currey, DR				Tackman, GE; Bills, BG; James, TS; Currey, DR			Lake-gauge evidence for regional postglacial tilting in southern Manitoba	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The network of lake-level gauges in place for Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Manitoba, and Lake of the Woods presents an opportunity to study the contemporary pattern of postglacial rebound in a North American continental-interior region. We used a regional trend-surface model based on mean winter-season differences of lake level between pairs of gauges to extract the postglacial rebound signature recorded in the lake-gauge data. The results from a best-fitting planar model indicate that tilting is up to the northeast with a bearing of N(42.7 +/- 11.8)degrees E and a rate of (10.7 +/- 2.2) x 10(-9) rad.yr(-1). In spite of the fact that both the ICE-3G and ICE-4G load models are derived from the inversion of relative sea-level histories obtained from marine coastal sites, the pattern of rebound that we computed from these two ice models for this continental-interior region agrees reasonably wed with the pattern derived from the lake-gauge data. Rates computed from an ICE-3G load are in close agreement with those computed from the lake gauges, whereas rates derived from ICE-4G are 50% too slow When the planar pattern of postglacial rebound derived from the lake gauges in southern Manitoba and Lake of the Woods is linked to the lake-gauge-derived pattern of rebound over the Great Lakes region, the two-region pattern suggests influential source regions of rebound that include southern and southwestern Hudson Bay as wed as more local sources En western Ontario. It is possible that the spatial arrangement of ice domes predicted in the multidomed paleotopography of ICE-4G could explain the two-region pattern of rebound if more ice were added to Ontario in the model, or if Earth structure assumptions could be modified, or both. As postglacial tilting continues to shift the region's lakes to the southwest, there is an increased risk of flooding and wave erosion along the south shores over the long term. In addition, postglacial tilting deforms the datums to which the lake-level gauges are referenced. Thus, where and how the levels of these lakes are measured is an important operational issue. These Factors present challenges to water-resource managers who are responsible for monitoring the levels and controlling the outflows of these lakes.

However, there is still not a robust empirical calibration relationship derived from lacustrine authigenic carbonates that can be used to calculate lake water temperatures from Delta(47) values. In this study, we present a new calibration dataset that is comprised of measurements of the clumped isotope composition of 33 lacustrine authigenic carbonates collected from terminal lakes primarily in Western China that cover a substantial altitudinal gradient, and 5 samples from other regions. These data allow us to directly derive a temperature calibration for lacustrine authigenic carbonates. Our results show a robust correlation between modern lacustrine authigenic carbonate clumped isotope composition (Delta(47carb)) values and independently measured mean summer water surface temperatures (T-water) (ranging from 9.8 to 26.0 degrees C), which confirms the utility of mass-47 clumped isotope measurements of lacustrine authigenic carbonates as a lake water temperature indicator and allows for the derivation of the following calibration equation: Delta(47carb) (parts per thousand) = 0.0521 +/- 0.0071 x 10(6)/T-water(2) (K) + 0.0904 +/- 0.0870 (R-2 = 0.6224, P < 0.0001, n = 33). We observe that Delta(47carb) is significantly correlated to lake elevation at 35 degrees N from 270 to 5,156 m a.s.l. The change in Delta(47)-derived water temperature differences through elevation gradients (i.e. lapse rate) is around 3.2 degrees C/km. We do not observe a significant correlation between Delta(47carb) and carbonate oxygen isotopic composition or independently measured lake surface water oxygen isotopic composition. Additionally, in our dataset, we find that water chemistry, carbonate precipitation rate, carbonate content and mineral-specific differences do not significantly affect Delta(47carb) values. Hence, the mass-47 clumped isotope signal of lacustrine authigenic carbonate can be used in paleotemperature and paleoaltimetry studies if post-depositional diagenesis did not modify the isotopic composition.

The importance of nutrient co-limitation in regulating algal community composition, productivity and algal-derived DOC in an oligotrophic marsh in interior Alaska	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Compared to lakes and streams, we know relatively little about the factors that regulate algae in freshwater wetlands. This discrepancy is particularly acute in boreal regions, where wetlands are abundant and processes related to climate change (i.e. increased permafrost collapse and soil weathering) are expected to increase nutrient inputs into aquatic systems. To investigate how accelerated nutrient inputs might affect algal structure and function in northern boreal wetlands, we added nitrogen, phosphorus and silica to mesocosms in an oligotrophic marsh in interior Alaska. 2. We conducted two in situ mesocosm enrichment experiments during consecutive summer growing seasons, each lasting 24 days. In 2007, we investigated the effects of +N, +P, +Si and +N+P+Si enrichment on benthic algal biomass (chlorophyll-a, ash-free dry mass, biovolume), chemistry (N : P ratio) and community composition. In 2008, we expanded our first experiment to investigate the effects +N+P, +N+Si, +P+Si and +N+P+Si on the same algal parameters as well as productivity (mg C m-2 h-1). 3. In both experiments, we measured water-column dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inside treatment enclosures and related changes in DOC to standing algal biomass. 4. Benthic algal accrual did not increase following 24 days of enrichment with any nutrient alone or with P and Si together (+P+Si), but increased significantly with the addition of N in any combination with P and Si (+N+P, +N+Si, +N+P+Si). 5. Algal productivity (20 mg C m-2 h-1) increased between three- and seven-fold (57-127 mg C m-2 h-1) with the addition of N in combination with any other nutrient (+N+P, +N+Si, +N+P+Si). Water-column DOC concentration was significantly higher inside N-combination treatments compared to the control during each season, and DOC increased linearly with benthic algal biomass in 2007 (r2 = 0.89, P < 0.0001) and 2008 (r2 = 0.74, P < 0.0001). 6. Taxonomic composition of the wetland algal community responded most strongly to N-combination treatments in both seasons. In 2007, there was a significant shift from Euglena and Mougeotia in the control treatment to Chroococcus and Gloeocystis with +N+P+Si enrichment, and in 2008, a Mougeotia-dominated community was replaced by Gloeocystis in the +N+P treatment and by Nitzschia in +N+Si and +N+P+Si treatments. 7. Together, these data provide several lines of evidence for co-limitation, and the central importance of N as a co-limiting nutrient for the wetland algal community. Changes in algal dynamics with increased nutrient concentrations could have important implications for wetland food webs and suggest that algae may provide a functional link between increasing nutrient inputs and altered wetland carbon cycling in this region.					; Turetsky, Merritt/B-1255-2013	Wyatt, Kevin/0000-0002-0916-7398; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2010	55	9					1845	1860		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02419.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02419.x													WOS:000280997300004

Breaching of an ice dam at Qorlortossup tasia, south Greenland	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY, VOL 42, 2005	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY				International Symposium on Arctic Glaciology	AUG 23-27, 2004	Geilo, NORWAY	Int Arct Sci Comm, Norwegian Res Council				In July 2003 an ice-dammed lake was suddenly drained in an outburst flood at Qorlortorssup tasia in south Greenland, the site of a projected hydropower station. The lake developed during the first decades of the 20th century as a result of the recession of the ice cap in this area. It used to drain over a shallow rock spillway towards Sermeq kangigdleq, the adjacent outlet glacier to the north. In order to assess the hazard potential and the additional water contribution from the enlarged catchment, the glacial lake and its surroundings were investigated. Based on the analysis of available historical data, field investigations and model results, the history of lake generation and the sudden outbreak were reconstructed. With the lake formation the ice dam lost its connection to the ice cap. The flood was initiated after the ice surface became low enough for the lake water to overflow the glacier towards Qorlortorssup tasia basin, creating a gully through the glacier which drained approximately 55 X 10(6) m(3) of water over a period of 8-10 days. Thanks to the stability of the dam and the downstream damping of the flood, there was no serious threat to a farm that is situated close to the planned power-station site. In the future, we expect much smaller floods, as a result of partial closure of the gully by ice movement or snowdrift in the winter. The new drainage pattern into Qorlortorssup tasia basin, however, will be a permanent situation. The amount of this new water contribution can only be roughly estimated since the exact size of the drainage basin is not well known.

Phycocyanin (PC)-rich and phycoerythrin (PE)-rich Synechococcus spp. isolated from this ecosystem responded differently to N-deprivation. The PC-rich strains BO8801, BO8805 and BO8806 exhibited a rapid decrease of phycobiliprotein to chlorophyll-a ratio. Concomittantly, an accumulation of cellular carbohydrates as well as enhanced concentrations of released extracellular polysaccharides were observed. Addition of the concentrated cell-free culture medium from the N-deprived PC-rich strain BO8806 increased the light-induced nitrogenase activity of picoplankton fractions enriched in heterotrophic bacteria including diazotrophic ones from the pelagic zone (HPP). In contrast, the PE-rich strains BO8807, BO8808 and BO8809 did not respond to N-deprivation in pigment composition and no significant accumulation of polysaccharides was observed. Accordingly, no support of bacterial light-induced nitrogenase activity was found when concentrated culture medium of the N-deprived PE-rich isolate BO8807 was applied. This indicates that, different from the PE-rich isolates, the PC-rich strains released compounds which were metabolized by diazotrophic phototrophs present in the HPP Weekly examination during one year of picoplankton fractions of Lake Constance for the capability to reduce acetylene revealed the occurrence of an enhanced light-induced nitrogenase activity profile concurrent with the spring bloom of picocyano-bacteria. These findings suggest that PC-rich picocyanobacteria may contribute to the C-supply of diazotrophic bacteria in the natural environment.																			0003-9136					JAN	1998	141	2					181	194																WOS:000072478700004

Oxidation state of iron in alteration minerals associated with sandstone-hosted unconformity-related uranium deposits and apparently barren alteration systems in the Athabasca Basin, Canada: Implications for exploration	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Sandstone-hosted unconformity-related U deposits in the Athabasca Basin at McArthur River Zone 4 and Maurice Bay as well as barren alteration systems at Wheeler River Zone "K" and Spring Point are surrounded by an outer, peripheral zone of illite and an inner, central zone of chlorite alteration. The oxidation state of Fe determined by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy of illite, sudoite, and clinochlore from these systems indicates that pre-ore illite contains mostly Fe3+ (Fe3+/Sigma Fe = 0.77-1.00), reflecting formation from a predominantly oxidizing basinal fluid. Lower Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios are recorded by late pre-ore sudoite and clinochlore occurring near faulted unconformities, consistent with the contribution to the chlorites from reducing basement-derived fluids. Sudoite and clinochlore in the alteration halo of barren systems are more reduced (Fe3+/Sigma Fe median = 0.3-0.4) than sudoite from mineralized systems (Fe3+/Sigma Fe median = 0.45-0.55). Sudoite from both systems becomes broadly more oxidized with increasing distance from the fault zone. Variations in the Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios of sudoite and clinochlore support a mechanism in which Fe2+ transported by reducing basement-derived fluids is partially oxidized to Fe3+ by basinal fluids prior to incorporation into the chlorite. Thus, scarcity of oxidizing U-bearing basinal fluids available for interaction with reducing basement fluids is a critical factor precluding U mineralization in barren systems. Trends of decreasing Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios in sudoite coupled with decreasing Pb-207/Pb-206 ratios of leachable Pb can be used as geochemical vectors to the sites of potential U mineralization.

J	Williams, CJ; Frost, PC; Xenopoulos, MA				Williams, Clayton J.; Frost, Paul C.; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A.			Beyond best management practices: pelagic biogeochemical dynamics in urban stormwater ponds	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Urban stormwater ponds are considered to be a best management practice for flood control and the protection of downstream aquatic ecosystems from excess suspended solids and other contaminants. Following this, urban ponds are assumed to operate as unreactive settling basins, whereby their overall effectiveness in water treatment is strictly controlled by physical processes. However, pelagic microbial biogeochemical dynamics could be significant contributors to nutrient and carbon cycling in these small, constructed aquatic systems. In the present study, we examined pelagic biogeochemical dynamics in 26 stormwater ponds located in southern Ontario, Canada, during late summer. Initially, we tested to see if total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, which provides a measure of catchment disturbance, landscape stability, and pond performance, could be used as an indirect predictor of plankton stocks in stormwater ponds. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using TSS as a surrogate for external loading suggested that TSS was an imperfect predictor. TSS masked plankton-nutrient relationships and appeared to reflect autochthonous production moreso than external forces. When TSS was excluded, the SEM model explained a large amount of the variation in dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics (55-75%) but a small amount of the variation in plankton stocks (3-38%). Plankton stocks were correlated positively with particulate nutrients and extracellular enzyme activities, suggesting rapid recycling of the fixed nutrient and carbon pool with consequential effects on DOM. DOM characteristics across the ponds were mainly of autochthonous origin. Humic matter from the watershed formed a larger part of the DOM pool only in ponds with low productivity and low dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Our results suggest that in these small, high nutrient systems internal processes might outweigh the impact of the landscape on carbon cycles. Hence, the overall benefit that constructed ponds serve to protect downstream environments must be weighed with the biogeochemical processes that take place within the water body, which could offset pond water quality gains by supporting intense microbial metabolism. Finally, TSS did not provide a useful indication of stormwater pond biogeochemistry and was biased by autochthonous production, which could lead to erroneous TSS-based management conclusions regarding pond performance.

J	Chai, L; Zhou, YQ; Wang, XP				Chai, Lei; Zhou, Yunqiao; Wang, Xiaoping			Impact of global warming on regional cycling of mercury and persistent organic pollutants on the Tibetan Plateau: current progress and future prospects	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Global warming profoundly affects not only mountainous and polar environments, but also the global and regional cycling of pollutants. Mercury (Hg) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have global transport capacity and are regulated by the Minamata Convention and Stockholm Convention, respectively. Since the beginning of this century, understanding of the origin and fate of Hg and POPs on the Tibetan Plateau (TP, also known as the third pole) has been deepening. In this paper, the existing literature is reviewed to comprehensively understand the atmospheric transport, atmospheric deposition, cumulative transformation and accumulation of Hg and POPs on the TP region under the background of global warming. The biogeochemical cycle of both Hg and POPs has the following environmental characteristics: (1) the Indian summer monsoon and westerly winds carry Hg and POPs inland to the TP; (2) the cold trapping effect causes Hg and POPs to be deposited on the TP by dry and wet deposition, making glaciers, permafrost, and snow the key sinks of Hg and POPs; (3) Hg and POPs can subsequently be released due to the melting of glaciers and permafrost; (4) bioaccumulation and biomagnification of Hg and POPs have been examined in the aquatic food chain; (5) ice cores and lake cores preserve the impacts of both regional emissions and glacial melting on Hg and POP migration. This implies that comprehensive models will be needed to evaluate the fate and toxicity of Hg and POPs on larger spatial and longer temporal scales to forecast their projected tendencies under diverse climate scenarios. Future policies and regulations should address the disrupted repercussions of inclusive CC such as weather extremes, floods and storms, and soil sustainable desertification on the fate of Hg and POPs. The present findings advocate the strengthening of the cross-national programs aimed at the elimination of Hg and POPs in polar (Arctic, Antarctic and TP) and certain mountainous (the Himalaya, Rocky Mountains, and Alps) ecosystems for better understanding the impacts of global warming on the accumulation of Hg/POPs in cold and remote areas.					; Zhou, Yunqiao/A-3477-2015; Wang, Xiaoping/F-4707-2013; Zhou, Yunqiao/AAO-9529-2021	Wang, Xiaoping/0000-0001-7524-7540; Zhou, Yunqiao/0000-0003-4896-6536													2050-7887	2050-7895				OCT 19	2022	24	10					1616	1630		10.1039/d1em00550b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00550b		JUN 2022						35770617					WOS:000820061800001

Based on radiocarbon dates, median grain sizes, and elemental ratios of strontium (Sr), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) measured by high-resolution X-ray fluorescence core scanning, we tested potential indicators of past heavy rainfall. During the past 7000 years, temporal changes in median grain size and elemental ratios (Sr/Ti and Zr/Ti) were found to be similar to those in the Asian monsoonal precipitation index and sea surface temperature (SST) in the western North Pacific region, suggesting that periods with increased elemental ratios may have been influenced by intensified regional rainfall events and higher SSTs. During the past 2000 years, time series of Sr/Ti and Zr/Ti ratios in the paleolake sediments appeared to covary with a megadrought period (AD 1593-1698; 357-252 cal BP), flooding events in the 1500s, and the collapse of ancient nations in Korea and other parts of East Asia. This similarity between sedimentary records and historical events suggests considerable potential for the dating of elemental ratios in lake sediments as high-resolution analogs of past hydrological events to support historical records.

J	Fisher, TG; Breckenridge, A				Fisher, Timothy G.; Breckenridge, Andy			Relative lake level reconstructions for glacial Lake Agassiz spanning the Herman to Campbell levels	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake Agassiz was the largest North American pro-glacial lake during the last deglacial period, and the routing of the overflow is hypothesized to have affected thermohaline circulation and in turn, global climate. Here an existing glacial isostatic adjustment model is applied to Campbell beach strandline data to synthesize and correlate published radiocarbon-and OSL-dated lake level indicators in an effort to produce relative lake-level curves and a drainage history. The curves highlight where the water level history of Lake Agassiz is well understood, and where additional work is necessary. Many OSL-dated strandlines between 14.5 and 13.2 ka record meltwater routing through a southern outlet to the Gulf of Mexico during this time, and that lake levels fell due to sill incision and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Oxygen isotope records from marine sediments tracking continental runoff, plus deglacial iso-chrones, suggest eastern outlets to the Atlantic Ocean opened at around 13.2 ka, near the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) stadial, but the evidence within the basin is scant. At some point during the YD, Lake Agassiz overflow shifted to a northwestern outlet into the Arctic Ocean, and the reconstructed lake levels track lake-level rise driven by uplift of the northwestern outlet, which eventually transferred water to the southern outlet to create the Campbell level of Lake Agassiz. The apparent shallow water depth (similar to 4 m) of overflow at the southern outlet relative to earlier phases suggests multiple active outlets at this time (northwestern, southern, and perhaps eastern). Oxygen isotope records from the Gulf of Mexico indicate overflow via the southern outlet occurred in two brief phases, likely explained by an oscillating ice margin that regulated overflow. Considerable work remains to assess the timing of deglaciation to understand when Lake Agassiz first drained east and north. Lacking are details of eastern drainage and any dated stratigraphic record of likely lake level fluctuations during the Younger Dryas. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lake Ontario Deepwater Sculpin Recovery: An Unexpected Outcome of Ecosystem Change	FROM CATASTROPHE TO RECOVERY: STORIES OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT SUCCESS												Fish population recoveries can result from ecosystem change in the absence of targeted restoration actions. In Lake Ontario, native Deepwater Sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii were common in the late 1800s, but by the mid -1900s the species was possibly extirpated. During this period, mineral nutrient inputs increased and piscivore abundance declined, which increased the abundance of the nonnative planktivores Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax. Deepwater Sculpin larvae are pelagic and vulnerable to predation by planktivores. Annual bottom trawl surveys did not capture Deepwater Sculpin from 1978 to 1995 (n = 6,666 tows) despite sampling appropriate habitat (trawl depths: 7-170 m). The absence of observations during this time resulted in an elevated conservation status for the species, but no restoration actions were initiated. In 1996, three individuals were caught in bottom trawls, the first observed since 1972. Since then, their abundance has increased, and in 2017, they were the second most abundant Lake Ontario prey fish. The food -web changes that occurred from 1970 through the 1990s contributed to this recovery. Alewife and Rainbow Smelt abundance declined during this period due to predation by stocked salmonids and legislation that reduced nutrient inputs and food web productivity. In the 1990s, proliferation of nonnative, filter feeding dreissenid mussels dramatically increased water clarity. As light penetration increased, the early-spring depth distribution of Alewife and Rainbow Smelt shifted deeper, away from larval Deepwater Sculpin habitat. The intentional and unintentional changes that occurred in Lake Ontario were not targeted at Deepwater Sculpin restoration but resulted in conditions that favored the species' recovery. While standard surveys documented the recovery, more diverse information (e.g., observations in deep habitats and early-life stages) would have improved our understanding of why the species recovered when it did. Annual Lake Ontario trawl surveys have collaboratively expanded their spatial extent and diversified habitat sampled, based on lessons learned from the Deepwater Sculpin recovery.

Annual Survival of Double-crested Cormorants from the Great Lakes, 1979-2006	WATERBIRDS												Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations have rapidly increased in the Great Lakes and in wintering areas in the southeast USA since the mid-1970s, resulting in conflicts with humans. To increase understanding of their population biology, band-recovery models were used to estimate temporal trends in hatch year (HY), second year (SF), and after second year (ASY) survival of cormorants banded in the Great Lakes from 1979 to 2006. SY and ASY annual survival varied among years with no apparent trend. HY annual survival exhibited a negative log-linear trend. Lack of clear temporal patterns in SF and ASY survival suggested that increases in cormorant abundance subsequent to 1979 did not impact survival in these age-classes, whereas HY annual survival declined as abundance increased. In addition, issuance of depredation orders in 1998 and 2003 appeared to have a small negative effect on HY survival, but no clear effect on SF and ASY annual survival. The percentage of band returns reported from cormorant control operations generally increased over time, and greatly during the depredation orders. Mean +/- SE annual survival from 1979 to 2006 was 0.446 +/- 0.022 for HY, 0.835 +/- 0.026 for SF, and 0.884 +/- 0.020 for ASY individuals. Although increases in cormorant abundance did not appear to be related to increases in annual survival, the relatively high average annual survival rate of ASY cormorants may have been responsible for rapid population growth in the 1980s and 1990s in the Great Lakes.

J	ISHIKAWA, T; TANAKA, M				ISHIKAWA, T; TANAKA, M			DIURNAL STRATIFICATION AND ITS EFFECTS ON WIND-INDUCED CURRENTS AND WATER QUALITIES IN LAKE KASUMIGAURA, JAPAN	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH												Diurnal stratification and its effects on wind-induced current and water qualities in a shallow eutrophicated lake are discussed based on the field data obtained in Lake Kasumigaura (36-degrees-N, 140-degrees-E, Japan). Diurnal stratification makes a weak thermocline with the temperature difference of about 1-degrees-C. Because a thermocline prevents the vertical momentum transport, it inevitably creates the two-layered flow pattern. The temperature profile has double-thermocline when the thermocline formed one day remains in the following morning. Then, the old thermocline tends to stay near the bottom for several days because the wind mixing works only on the new thermocline developed at upper elevation. DO concentration near the bottom markedly decreases under such condition, because the vertical DO transport is suppressed by the thermocline. PO4-P is released at high rate from the bed sediments after DO concentration falls below 4 ppm. The entrainment rate is discussed with reference to the basic models which are the turbulent erosion model (TEM) and the dynamic instability model (DIM). It is concluded that DIM, rather than TEM, is suitable to explain the mixing of diurnal stratification observed in this study. The entrainment rate E[U(m)] is found to vary as R(i)[U*]-1, where E[U(m)] = W(e)/U(m), W(e) is the entrainment velocity, U(m) is the vertically averaged velocity in the mixed layer, R(i)[U*] = B/U*2, B is the buoyancy of the mixed layer and U* is the friction velocity at the water surface.																			0022-1686						1993	31	3					307	322		10.1080/00221689309498828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00221689309498828													WOS:A1993LJ30000002

We investigate the sensitivity of this high altitude site to vegetational and climate dynamics and altitudinal shifts during the Holocene by comparing palynological spectra of the fossil sequence and pollen rain content from current moss pollsters. We hypothesize that the input of sediments in lakes at such altitude is strongly controlled by ice phenology (ice-free summer months) and that during cold periods Pollen Accumulation Rate (PAR) and Pollen Concentration (PC) reflect changes in ice-cover and thus is linked to temperature changes. Low sedimentation rates and low PC and PAR occurred during colder periods as the Younger Dryas (GS-1) and the Holocene onset (12.6-10.2 kyr cal BP), suggesting that the lake-surface remained ice-covered for most of the year during these periods. Warmer conditions are not evident until 10.2 kyr cal BP, when an abrupt increase in sedimentation rate, PC and PAR occur, pointing to a delayed onset of the Holocene temperature increase at high altitude. Well-developed pinewoods and deciduous forest dominated the mid montane belt since 9.3 kyr cal BP until mid-Holocene (5.2 kyr cal BP). A downwards shift in the deciduous forest occurred after 5.2 kyr cal BP, in agreement with the aridity trend observed at a regional and Mediterranean context. The increase of herbaceous taxa during the late-Holocene (3.5 kyr cal BP-present) reflects a general trend to reduced montane forest, as anthropogenic disturbances were not evident until 1.3 kyr cal BP when Olea proportions from lowland areas and other anthropogenic indicators clearly expand. Our study demonstrates the need to perform local experimental approaches to check the effect of ice phenology on high altitude lakes sensitivity to vegetation changes to obtain more realistic reconstructions of mountain vegetation belts dynamics.					; Oliva-Urcia, Belén/K-4485-2014; Gil-Romera, Graciela/C-9262-2016; Garcés, Blas/L-4246-2014; Aranbarri, Josu/V-3005-2019; Callejo, Miguel/AAW-7495-2020; Oliva-Urcia, Belen/K-4485-2014; Moreno, Ana/AAB-5761-2019; GONZALEZ-SAMPERIZ, PENELOPE/H-4212-2015	Aranbarri, Josu/0000-0002-4903-9593; Leunda, Maria/0000-0002-9186-3121; Gil-Romera, Graciela/0000-0001-5726-2536; Moreno, Ana/0000-0001-7357-584X; Oliva-Urcia, Belen/0000-0003-1563-6434; Gonzalez-Samperiz, Penelope/0000-0002-5097-1468; Sevilla Callejo, Miguel/0000-0003-1856-4659													0921-8181	1872-6364				OCT	2017	157						214	231		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.08.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.08.008													WOS:000413612100016

Population Characteristics of Black Bullhead (Ameiurus melas) in Iowa Natural Lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Black bullhead (Ameiurus melas) populations in three natural lakes in northwestern Iowa were sampled to describe abundance, size structure, condition, mortality, recruitment variability, and growth in relation to a range of physical and limnological conditions. Six-hundred-and-fifty-three black bullhead were sampled with modified fyke nets during summer 2008 from Silver Lake, Lake Minnewashta, and West Okoboji Lake. Catch-per-unit-effort of black bullhead in Silver Lake (21.9 fish per net-night; fish/NN) was significantly higher than in Lake Minnewashta (P<0.01; 10.4 fish/NN) and West Okoboji Lake (P<0.0 1: 5.6 fish/NN). Proportional size distribution (PSD) was similar among populations, but PSD of preferred-length fish in Silver Lake was much greater than in the other lakes. Mean relative weights were generally high across all lakes (90-92) but were highest in Silver Lake. Total annual mortality was highest in Lake Minnewashta, (79%) and lowest in Silver Lake (24%). Recruitment variability of black bullhead, measured with the recruitment variability index, was 0.69 in West Okoboji Lake, 0.62 in Lake Minnewashta, and 0.47 in Silver Lake. Black bullhead length at age 3 differed (P<0.01) among lakes and was highest in Silver Lake (274 mm) followed by Lake Minnewashta (247 mm) and West Okoboji Lake (228 mm). Silver Lake is considered to have the poorest water quality of the study lakes due to high nutrient concentrations and low water clarity. The influence of black bullhead on water quality conditions is unknown, but our results suggest that these conditions are ideal for black bullhead populations in Iowa lakes.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2009	24	4					635	644		10.1080/02705060.2009.9664341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2009.9664341													WOS:000271835100014
J	Vadeboncoeur, Y; Lodge, DM; Carpenter, SR				Vadeboncoeur, Y; Lodge, DM; Carpenter, SR			Whole-lake fertilization effects on distribution of primary production between benthic and pelagic habitats	ECOLOGY												The perception that primary production in lakes is positively related to phosphorus loading is based almost entirely on studies of phytoplankton. This is partly because benthic and pelagic habitats in lakes are often treated as separate ecosystems, the processes of which can be evaluated independently. However, Light and nutrients often limit primary producers in both benthic and pelagic habitats. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in light associated with increases in phytoplankton could cause compensatory decreases in benthic algal (periphyton) primary production. We monitored production of periphyton on sediments (epipelon), periphyton on wood (epixylon), and phytoplankton in four lakes in upper Michigan, USA, from 1991 to 1995. During the summers of 1993-1995, we stimulated phytoplankton production in three of the lakes by fertilizing with nitrogen and phosphorus (N:P greater than or equal to 25 by atoms) at rates between 0.3 and 2.0 mg P .m(-3).d(-1). The response of periphyton to fertilization was substratum specific: epixylon increased with fertilization, but epipelon decreased. However, when area-specific production was extrapolated to the whole-lake scale, epixylon never constituted >4% of benthic primary production. Thus, the decline in epipelic production dominated the benthic response to fertilization. We also estimated whole-lake (epipelon + phytoplankton) primary production. Epipelic algae constituted 50-80% of whole-lake primary production at ambient nutrient levels. However, only 10-40% of primary production was benthic at the highest fertilization rates. The increase in whole-lake primary production caused by water column fertilization was greatly overestimated when we did not include the compensatory decline in epipelic algae as they were shaded by increases in phytoplankton concentrations.

Assessment of using spaceborne LiDAR to monitor the particulate backscatter coefficient on large, freshwater lakes: A test using CALIPSO on Lake Michigan	FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING												The Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite was launched in 2006 with the primary goal of measuring the properties of clouds and aerosols in Earth's atmosphere using LiDAR. Since then, numerous studies have shown the viability of using CALIPSO to observe day/night differences in subsurface optical properties of oceans and large seas from space. To date no studies have been done on using CALIPSO to monitor the subsurface optical properties of large, freshwater-lakes. This is likely due to the limited spatial resolution of CALIPSO, which makes the mapping of subsurface properties of regions smaller than large seas impractical. Still, CALIPSO does pass over some of the world's largest, freshwater-lakes, yielding important information about the water. Here we use the entire CALIPSO data record (approximately 15 years) to measure the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp, m-1) across Lake Michigan. We then compare the LiDAR derived values of bbp to optical imagery values obtained from MODIS and to in situ measurements. Critically, we find that the LiDAR derived bbp aligns better in non-summer months with in situ values when compared to the optically imagery. However, due to both high cloud coverage and high wind speeds on Lake Michigan, this comes with the caveat that the CALIPSO product is limited in its usability. We close by speculating on the roll that spaceborne LiDAR, including CALIPSO and other satitlites, have on the future of monitoring the Great Lakes and other large bodies of fresh water.																				2673-6187				FEB 7	2023	4								1104681	10.3389/frsen.2023.1104681	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2023.1104681													WOS:001063269700001

Survey and assessment of post volcanic activities of a young caldera lake, Lake Cuicocha, Ecuador	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Cuicocha is a young volcano adjacent to the inactive Pleistocene Cotacachi volcano complex, located in the western cordilleras of the Ecuadorian Andes. A series of eruptions with intensive ash emission and collapse of the caldera occurred around 4500-3000 y BP. A crater 3.2 km in diameter and a maximum depth of 450 m was formed. Further eruptions of the volcano occurred 1300 y BP and formed four smaller domes within the caldera. Over the last few hundred years, a caldera lake has developed, with a maximum depth of 148 m. The lake water is characterized by sodium carbonate with elevated concentrations of manganese, calcium and chloride. Nowadays, an emission of gases, mainly CO(2), and an input of warm spring water occur in Lake Cuicocha. The zone of high activity is in the western basin of the lake at a depth of 78 m, and continuous gas emissions with sediment resuspension were observed using sonar. In the hypolimnion of the lake, CO(2) accumulation occurs up to 0.2% saturation, but the risk of a limnic eruption can be excluded at present. The lake possesses monomictic stratification behaviour, and during overturn an intensive gas exchange with the atmosphere occurs. Investigations concerning the sedimentation processes of the lake suggest only a thin sediment layer of up to 10-20 cm in the deeper lake basin; in the western bay, in the area of gas emissions, the lake bottom is partly depleted of sediment in the form of holes, and no lake colmation exists. Decreases in the lake water level of about 30 cm y(-1) indicate a percolation of water into fractures and fissures of the volcano, triggered by a nearby earthquake in 1987.																			1561-8633						2009	9	3					699	712		10.5194/nhess-9-699-2009	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-9-699-2009													WOS:000267543300005

Progeny of these stockings in the 1989 and 1990 year classes were sampled in October as age-0 and again the following May and electrophoretically assayed to assign phenotypes for comparison of overwinter survival, first-year growth, and relative weight. Subspecies as well as intergrade (F-1 and F-x) phenotypes were present in both year classes. First-generation hybrids dominated the 1989 cohort, but F-x and F-1 bass were equally prominent in the 1990 year class. Approximately 50% of examined alleles were of Florida bass origin in both year classes. Differential overwinter mortality occurred among phenotypes in both year classes, with the percentage of the Florida subspecies declining by two-thirds while intergrade bass proportionally increased. First-year growth and relative weight did not vary consistently among phenotypes. The Florida subspecies of largemouth bass is likely to provide at best only a small;ind short-term direct contribution when stocked in waters experiencing winter thermal regimes like that of Briery Creek Lake (greater than or equal to 100 days <10 C water temperature, >1,900 heating degree days). Potential benefits of Florida largemouth bass introductions to Virginia and states with similar climates may be outweighed by the consequences of persistent contamination of northern largemouth bass gene pools.																									1997							192	198																WOS:000081833300028
J	Vainu, M; Terasmaa, J				Vainu, Marko; Terasmaa, Jaanus			The consequences of increased groundwater abstraction for groundwater dependent closed-basin lakes in glacial terrain	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												According to the European Union Water Framework Directive groundwater and surface-water resources have to be managed in an integrated way. The utilisation of groundwater resources must not harm surface-water ecosystems that are directly dependent on groundwater. The study evaluates the effects of increased groundwater abstraction (a) on a regional scale to groundwater and lake levels in a lake district, and (b) on a local scale to the seepage patterns in one example lake. After a 51 % increase in the pumping rates from an unconfined aquifer the water levels of three closed-basin lakes near the intake fell 0.3-0.7 m in 1 year, but did not change in the two lakes further from the intake. Ground-water levels in the aquifer dropped up to 0.8 m near the intake, but did not change further from the wells. Seepage measurements at the bottom of one lake showed that before the increased abstraction outseepage occurred in its northern side, after the increased abstraction the outseepage area had widened towards its western side. The results confirm that the groundwater level drop and the consequent lake-level drop were caused by the increased abstraction rate. The outcomes of the rare opportunity to analyse lake/groundwater interactions both before and after increased human intervention provide a cautionary example of what may happen to and in groundwater-dependent lakes if the groundwater/surface-water interactions are not fully clarified before the intervention in potentially similar cases around the world.					; Terasmaa, Jaanus/E-7077-2018	Terasmaa, Jaanus/0000-0002-1346-6411; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	2							92	10.1007/s12665-015-4967-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4967-5													WOS:000370240800003
J	Seppä, H; Poska, A				Seppä, H; Poska, A			Holocene annual mean temperature changes in Estonia and their relationship to solar insolation and atmospheric circulation patterns	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We reconstructed annual mean temperature (T-ann) trends from three radiocarbon-dated Holocene pollen stratigraphies from lake sediments in Estonia, northern Europe. The reconstructions were carried out using a North-European pollen-climate calibration model based on weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. The cross-validated prediction error of the model is 0.89degreesC and the coefficient of determination between observed modem T-ann values and those predicted by the model is 0.88. In the reconstruction, the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) is distinguishable at 8000-4500 cal yr B.P., with the expansion of thermophilous tree species and T-ann on average 2.5degreesC higher than at present. The pollen-stratigraphical data reflect progressively warmer and drier summers during the HTM. Analogously with the modem decadal-scale climatic variability in North Europe, we interpret this as an indication of increasing climatic continentality due to the intensification of anticyclonic circulation and meridional air flow. Post-HTM cooling started abruptly at around 4500 cal yr B.P. All three reconstructions show a transient (ca. 300 years) cooling of 1.5-2.0degreesC at 8600-8000 cal yr B.P. We tentatively correlate this cold event with the North-Atlantic "8.2 ka event" at 8400-8000 cal yr B.P. Provided that the 8.2 ka event was caused by freshening of the North-Atlantic surface water, our data provide evidence of the climatic and vegetational responsiveness of the boundary of the temperate and boreal zones to the weakening of the North-Atlantic thermohaline circulation and the zonal energy transport over Europe. No other cold events of comparable magnitude are indicated during the last 8000 years. (C) 2003 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

Previous ca. 620 Ma ages from the Broad River Group are now corroborated by additional dates from felsic tuff in the Gordon Falls Formation and rhyolite in the former Fairfield (now East Branch Black River) Formation of 620 +/- 5 Ma and 622 +/- 1.9 Ma, respectively. Combined with ages ranging from ca. 625 Ma to 615 Ma from crosscutting plutons, the data suggest that the minimum age of the Broad River Group is about 615 Ma. A quartzfeldspar porphyry dyke in mafic volcanic rocks of the previously undated Long Beach Formation yielded an igneous crystallization age of 685 +/- 10 Ma, the oldest unit yet dated in the Caledonia terrane but similar in age to porphyry in the Stirling belt in the Avalonian Mira terrane of Nova Scotia. The age of the Coldbrook Group was constrained previously by U-Pb (zircon) ages of volcanic rocks between 560 and 550 Ma as well as by similar ages from comagmatic plutons. Five additional samples from both volcanic and plutonic units lie in the same range of 560-550 Ma, including errors, demonstrating that the Coldbrook Group and related plutons formed in less than 10 million years. Such a large volume of mainly felsic magma erupted and emplaced in a short time span suggests a "supereruption/supervolcano" environment such as the late Cenozoic southwestern USA but not yet recognized at ca. 560-550 Ma elsewhere in Avalonia. Two units yielded Paleozoic ages: felsite of the Bloomsbury Mountain Formation with a zircon population at 427 +/- 9 Ma, indicating a Silurian maximum emplacement age, and dacite of the Grassy Lake Formation with several zircon grains at 382.8 +/- 8.3 Ma, indicating a maximum age of middle Devonian, the first rocks of this age to be identified in the Caledonia terrane.

Pond bank access as an approach for managing toxic cyanobacteria in beef cattle pasture drinking water ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forty-one livestock drinking water ponds in Alabama beef cattle pastures during were surveyed during the late summer to generally understand water quality patterns in these important water resources. Since livestock drinking water ponds are prone to excess nutrients that typically lead to eutrophication, which can promote blooms of toxigenic phytoplankton such as cyanobacteria, we also assessed the threat of exposure to the hepatotoxin, microcystin. Eighty percent of the ponds studied contained measurable microcystin, while three of these ponds had concentrations above human drinking water thresholds set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (i.e., 0.3 mu g/L). Water quality patterns in the livestock drinking water ponds contrasted sharply with patterns typically observed for temperate freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Namely, we found several non-linear relationships between phytoplankton abundance (measured as chlorophyll) and nutrients or total suspended solids. Livestock had direct access to all the study ponds. Consequently, the proportion of inorganic suspended solids (e.g., sediment) increased with higher concentrations of total suspended solids, which underlies these patterns. Unimodal relationships were also observed between microcystin and phytoplankton abundance or nutrients. Euglenoids were abundant in the four ponds with chlorophyll concentrations > 250 mu g/L (and dominated three of these ponds), which could explain why ponds with high chlorophyll concentrations would have low microcystin concentrations. Based on observations made during sampling events and available water quality data, livestock-mediated bioturbation is causing elevated total suspended solids that lead to reduced phytoplankton abundance and microcystin despite high concentrations of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Thus, livestock could be used to manage algal blooms, including toxic secondary metabolites, in their drinking water ponds by allowing them to walk in the ponds to increase turbidity.

The geophysical data of the lake confirm the existence of three physiographic provinces: a shelf, a slope, and a deep, relatively flat basin. The most prominent features identified on the shelf and slope are clinoforms, submerged channels, as well as closely spaced lake floor depressions, reflecting a highly variable lake-level history. The morphological depressions are interpreted as resulting from subaquatic erosion by channelized, sediment-laden currents into horizontally bedded fan sediments. Submerged channels on the eastern shelf are interpreted as meandering-slope channels, probably as a consequence of a lake-level fall that exposed the shelf area. Clinoforms on the Eastern fan may represent relict deltas formed during stationary or slightly rising lake-level intervals. Merging subsurface imaging interpretation with morphological studies of exposed sediments reveals lake-level fluctuations of several hundreds of meters during the past ca. similar to 550 ka. The lake has three prominent basins (Tatvan, Deveboynu, and the Northern basin) separated by basement ridges (e.g., the Northern ridge). The seismic units in the Tatvan and Northern basins are dominated by alternations of well-stratified and chaotic reflections, while the Deveboynu basin subsurface consists mainly of chaotic units. The chaotic seismic facies are interpreted as mass-flow deposits, probably triggered by earthquakes and/or rapid lake-level fluctuations. The moderate-to-high-amplitude, well-stratified facies seen in the deeper parts of the basins are interpreted as lacustrine deposits intercalated with tephra layers. The occurrence of a clinoform in the deepest part of the lake suggests a major flooding stage of Lake Van more than similar to 400 ka ago. Seismic profiles from the deepest part of the lake basin show remarkably uniform and continuous stratigraphic units without any major erosional feature following the flooding event, indicating that the lake was never completely dry afterward and therefore significantly older than previously suggested.

J	Schernewski, G				Schernewski, G			Nutrient budgets, dynamics and storm effects in a eutrophic, stratified Baltic Lake	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA												Between 1989 and 1998 the small eutrophic stratified Lake Belau was investigated intensively and multidisciplinarily. This article is a short, comprehensive summary and re-evaluation of the hydrochemistry of the lake, with focus on nitrogen and phosphorus. In several aspects the lake can be regarded as a typical example of the glacial north German lakes. The 1960's and 1970's are characterised by heavy nutrient inputs and fast eutrophication. During the last two decades the external nutrient load, especially the phosphorus load into Lake Belau was significantly reduced. But phosphorus-rich sediments and large areas with summerly anoxic sediment surface conditions cause intensive release of phosphorus from older deeper sediment layers. Annual budgets reveal that despite an average sediment accumulation of 3 mm a(-1) the lake has lost its function as net phosphorus sink and it is very likely that internal eutrophication by the sediments will keep the lake in its eutrophic state during the next decades. Despite that, monthly budgets of five vertical layers show that the main phosphorus supplier for the phosphorus depleted epilimnion during summer is the creek Alte Schwentine. The annual nitrogen budget indicates groundwater and interflow water as well as atmospheric input as additional important nitrogen sources. 36% (98 mumol m(-2) h(-1) N) of all nitrogen input is lost to atmosphere mainly due to denitrification. The example of a heavy storm shows that about 10% of the annual nitrogen loss to the atmosphere can take place during a single day and in form of ammonia. The storm further made obvious that these unpredictable events can have strong impact on nutrient cycling and ecology in Lake Belau and the lake can become an unexpected nutrient source for downstream systems.

Well-developed submerged meadows of charophytes are expression of clear water and rather low phytoplankton concentrations. Consequently, among aquatic macroscopic primary producers, charophytes are one of the most threatened groups being very sensitive to phosphorous availability, turbidity and water level perturbations. Accordingly, charophytes have been suffering a massive diversity loss worldwide over the last century, mainly because of human-induced pressures. During summer 2011, detailed field surveys were carried out with the main purpose of filling knowledge gaps concerning aquatic flora and vegetation of the Garda lake - the largest lake in Italy and one of the deepest in Europe. Along randomly selected transects, floristic data were collected following standard procedures, as imposed by the Water Framework Directive. Overall, 12 different species of charophytes were recorded, which accounts for 36% of total Italian charophytes and 19% of European species. The most diffuse species were Chara globularis and C. intermedia; whereas, the most interesting taxa were Chara polyacantha and Nitella hyalina, two species with narrow distribution in Italy. Overall in the Garda lake, dense stands of charophytes covered almost homogeneously the littoral sectors at a water depth between 3 and 12 m. The deepest species was C. globularis, which reached a maximum depth of colonisation of about 17.5 m. Charophytes represent a major element among the primary producers in the Garda lake. The high local charophyte diversity and the rather wide most colonised areas (similar to 1000-1200 ha) confirm that the Garda lake is an important reserve for many rare and threatened charophytes. For the first time, these results highlight the key role of the Garda lake for charophyte diversity at a national and European level.

The Oman Mountains are flanked by alluvial fans, which InfraRed Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) dating shows were being formed up to more than 300 ka BP, and possibly extend back to the Plio-Pleistocene. Other ages indicate high rainfall sufficient to induce conglomerate transport during a possible interstadial (31 ka) and, at 15 ka, coeval with a late glacial event. The bioclastic-rich sands of aeolianites were derived from the floor of the continental shelf when it was exposed during late Quaternary glaciations. In the Emirates, these sands were transported from the Arabian Gulf area by northern (Shamal) winds during the build-up to the last glaciation (99 and 64 ka), whereas in SE Oman, deposition seems to have coincided with the last two interglacials (229 and 112 ka) when the SW Monsoon is believed to have been active in the Wahiba area. Lowering of the sea level coincided with a fall of the water table in current interdune sabkhas of the Liwa, and the exposure in mesas of dune sands whose deposition was coeval with the last two glaciations (140 and 40 ka). 12 ka dune sand was later cut by rhizoconcretion probably associated with the higher rainfall of the Climatic Optimum in what is now an interdune sabkha of the Liwa.

However, owing to either the lack of robust independent chronology or ambiguous interpreting of climate proxies as well as complex geographic settings within the plateau, the nature of Holocene environmental changes and their influence factors remain controversial, particularly on whether the optimal climate condition (effective moisture peak) has prevailed during the early- or mid-Holocene. In this study, we reported a new well-dated sand dune accumulation record from the Shawotou sand field in the Babao River drainage area in the southeast Qilian Mountains, to unravel the late glacial and Holocene moisture variation history. The robust chronologies of aeolian sands and palaeosols from two sections were established based on densely collected 49 samples using post-infrared (IR) IR-stimulated luminescence dating of coarse-grained K-feldspar. Based on stratigraphic investigation of the sand dune/palaeosol sections, the results show that the climatic condition was very dry during the late glacial and early Holocene (14-8 ka), characterized by sand dune formation, and then the moisture peaked in the middle Holocene (8-4 ka) with the strongest pedogenesis, followed by a relatively dry condition in the late Holocene (since 4 ka). The regional comparison suggested that the Holocene moisture variation pattern seems synchronous over the NE Tibetan Plateau, that is, the dry early Holocene and late Holocene but with peaked moisture in the middle Holocene, which is likely attributed to the precipitation changes of the East Asian summer monsoon.					; ZHANG, JINGRAN/LZI-1054-2025; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022	Zhang, Jingran/0000-0002-4743-9673; 														2296-6463				AUG 29	2022	10								939887	10.3389/feart.2022.939887	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.939887													WOS:000854291000001
J	Simonetti, A; Gariépy, C; Carignan, J				Simonetti, A; Gariépy, C; Carignan, J			Pb and Sr isotopic compositions of snowpack from Quebec, Canada:: Inferences on the sources and deposition budgets of atmospheric heavy metals	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Elemental concentrations of Al, Ba, Cd, Cu, Mg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Sr, and Zn, as well as Pb and Sr isotopic compositions were determined in samples of snowpack obtained along two main transects from the province of Quebec (Canada); one north-south (between 47 degrees N and 55 degrees N; 1994) and the other within the St. Lawrence Valley (1997). Median enrichment factors (relative to upper crustal abundances) for Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn for all samples range from approximate to 300 to approximate to 42,000 and are indicative of an anthropogenic origin. Pb isotope ratios for snow samples retrieved in 1994 are highly variable ((206)pb/(207)pb = 1.148 to 1.193) and are characterized by the most radiogenic Sr isotope values (Sr-87/Sr-86 greater than or equal to 0.710). In contrast, the Pb and Sr isotope results for 1997 snow samples collected along the St. Lawrence Valley (below latitude 47 degrees N), yield the most radiogenic Pb isotope ratios ((206)pb/(207)pb = 1.180 to 1.190) and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios between 0.708 and 0.710. The former indicate that the atmospheric pollution in this region of Quebec is dominated by a mixture of anthropogenic emissions from U.S. ((206)pb/(207)pb approximate to 1.20) and Canadian ((206)pb/(207)pb approximate to 1.15) sources. Pb isotope ratios ((206)pb/(207)pb = 1.160 to 1.180) for 1997 samples collected north of latitude 47 degrees N indicate input of an additional anthropogenic component, possibly that of Eurasian pollution being transported over the high Arctic during the winter season. A comparison of the Pb isotope results between lichens and snow samples from identical sample locations indicate that these either overlap (along St. Lawrence Valley), or are significantly different (north-south transect). The latter discrepancy may be attributed to either: (1) different time scales for the integration of the atmospheric signal (months for snow vs. years for lichens); (2) recording of the atmospheric signal at substantially different altitudes; or (3) the presence of an important, local point source of atmospheric pollution. Annual depositional budgets have been estimated for Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, and Mn, and average values (g km(-2) yr(-1)) are 1500, 130, 196,000, 1900, and 6400, respectively. Compared to previous depositional fluxes (1993-1994) estimated from adjacent regions in North America, those reported here are slightly lower with the exception of Mn and Zn. The nondecrease in depositional fluxes of Mn may be attributed to combustion of Mn-bearing fossil fuels by automotive vehicles. The exact cause for the elevated annual depositional values for Zn, however, remains enigmatic. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Combined modelling of annual and diurnal land surface temperature cycles	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The land surface's thermal dynamics follows annual and diurnal cycles that are to a large extent controlled by solar geometry. Therefore, annual and diurnal variations of land surface temperature (LST) can be modelled with relatively simple functions controlled by a small number of parameters, typically from three to six. The parameter values of the models can be determined by fitting the respective functions to time series of LST observations. Commonly either annual or diurnal LST variations are modelled or they are modelled sequentially in a two-step process. Here, we combine an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model controlled by the solar zenith angle (ATCsza) with a four-parameter version of the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model GOT09: this yields a new annual-diurnal temperature cycle (ADTC) model that simultaneously describes the annual and diurnal surface temperature dynamics. The proposed ADTC model is controlled by physically meaningful parameters: annual minimum temperature, annual temperature amplitude, annual maximum of daily temperature amplitude, mean time of thermal noon and time lag of maximum temperature with respect to summer solstice. Thus, the entire annual-diurnal LST dynamics is described with only five parameters. The new model was tested by fitting it to one year of LST observations obtained for five globally representative tiles of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard EOS - TERRA and EOS - AQUA satellites. For these tiles, the mean of the root mean square error (RMSE) was 4.2 K. ADTC modelled LSTs were also compared against those obtained with the standard ATC model for the four MODIS overpass times at five representative sites: for these, an overall RMSE of 1.2 K between the two models was obtained. The ADTC derived LSTs were validated against insitu measurements from three different sites, which yielded an overall RMSE of 3.4 K. Additional investigations over five areas with different land covers (i.e. urban, lake, forest, mountain area and desert) revealed the potential of the ADTC parameters to describe the corresponding surface and climate properties. Since it is driven by solar geometry, the ADTC model reproduces double LST peaks in the tropics naturally. Furthermore, all available observations are modelled simultaneously, which means that a single set of parameters is obtained for each pixel and year.

J	Blanchard, FN; Finster, EB				Blanchard, FN; Finster, EB			A method of marking living snakes for future recognition, with a discussion of some problems and results	ECOLOGY												Snakes are marked for individual recognition at any future time by cutting off, with a pair of sharp scissors, 1-3 separate scales under the tail. Healing leaves permanent scars. Hundreds of individuals may be marked recognizably in a simple system. Snakes thus marked and released since the summer of 1929 in the vicinity of the Univ. of Michigan Biol. Sta. at Douglas Lake, Michigan, are chiefly Thamnophis sirtalis and Natrix sipedon. Recoveries of snakes liberated in previous yrs. have amounted to 6-8% in the semi-aquatic species. While some individuals have been found 1 and 2 yrs. later in the immediate vicinity of their release, others have been found at distances of 1, 2, 3, and even 5 miles away by the shortest routes that could have been taken. No general conclusions on wanderings are possible at present. Preliminary figures on rate of growth indicate that young water snakes, Natrix sipedon, increase about 50% of their length in a yr., but that adults increase only about 15% a yr. Young garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis, increase about 40% a yr. to begin with, but only about 5% after they become adult. This method of marking lends itself to a variety of problems in the habits of snakes, and should prove useful where many snakes are to be kept in a single enclosure.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1933	14						334	347		10.2307/1932657	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932657													WOS:000200240000029
J	Hounnou, L				Hounnou, Leon			Economic Impact of Climate Change on the Implementation of Best Management Practices in the Fort Cobb Watershed	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study determines the most cost-effective selection and location of Best Management Practice (BMP) scenarios for farmlands to reduce soil erosion and the delivery of sediment and phosphorus to the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed under current and future climate scenarios. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, detailed conservation practices (conservation tillage, contour farming, no-tillage, and terracing) are simulated to determine crop yields, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loss of three crops (winter wheat, irrigated cotton, and pasture) by each land use unit (hydrologic response units) and location in the watershed. An economic model is used to determine the cost-minimizing choice of BMP scenarios for each land-use unit that meets 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads and the impact of climate change on the net return to farmers. Results indicate that the effective spatial placement of BMP scenarios is not the same under different climatic conditions. The average optimal net return to farmers ranges from 170.39 to 316.32 $/acre for all the scenarios. The shadow prices vary from 2.36 to 17.78 $/ton/acre of sediment abated. Although individual BMP scenario is effective in reducing sediment loads, combined BMP scenarios achieve higher performance. This work will help guide policymakers and farmers in decision-making for the future regarding water quantity used and water quality downstream in the recreation area of the Fort Cobb Reservoir.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2022	58	6					1307	1325		10.1111/1752-1688.12999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12999		FEB 2022											WOS:000758584600001

Palaeoflood slackwater deposits (SWD) were identified at several sites on the riverbanks. These clayey silt beds are inserted into the Holocene aeolian loess-soil profiles and slope clastic deposits. They have recorded the extraordinary palaeoflood events which occurred between 3200 and 3000 yr BP as dated by OSL method and checked by the archaeological remains of the Neolithic and Bronze Age retrieved from the profile. The minimum flood peak discharges were estimated at between 22560 and 25960 m(3)/s by using palaeohydrological methods. It is 4.5-5.0 times the largest gauged flood (5030 m(3)/s) that has ever occurred since 1934. The palaeoflood slackwater deposits were found inserted into the pedostratigraphic boundary between the late-Holocene loess (L-0) and the mid-Holocene Luvisol (S-0) in the riverbank profile. This indicates that the extraordinary flood events were synchronous with the pedogenic regression at the end of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. The climatic proxies from the studied profile and the correlative profiles in the river valley and the Loess Plateau show that the pedogenic regression was forced by climatic aridity and intensified dust storms and dust falls in connection with monsoonal shift over the Yellow River basin at about 3100 yr BP. The extraordinary flood events were documented not only on the Weihe River, but also on the mainstream and other tributaries of the Yellow River. These suggest that both extraordinary floods and droughts were parts of the climatic variability during the monsoonal shift. These findings are of great importance in understanding the interactions between hydrological system and climatic change in the semi-arid and subhumid regions of the world.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2012	22	6					675	686		10.1177/0959683611409781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611409781													WOS:000304238500007
J	Häuselmann, P; Jeannin, PY; Bitterli, T				Häuselmann, P; Jeannin, PY; Bitterli, T			Relationships between karst and tectonics:: case-study of the cave system north of Lake Thun (Bern, Switzerland)	GEODINAMICA ACTA												The cave system is situated north of Lake Thun, in the Helvetic border chain. The overall geology is simple: the slightly dipping (15-25 degrees towards the southeast) strata are interrupted by a NE-SW trending normal fault with a throw of 150 m in the NE and about 500 m in the SW. Since a part of the region is covered by flysch, the caves are the only way to observe the geological setting of the underlying Cretaceous and Eocene series. We show that observations in caves may yield valuable information about the onset of the tectonic movements: in particular, observations in the Barenkluft region clearly demonstrate that the beginning of prealpine extension had already begun in the Upper Cretaceous, and that this normal fault has been inverted later during Alpine compression. We also illustrate the influence of tectonic stress and strain upon karstification, The Alpine tectonic phases, with alternating compression and extension, contributed to the development of different karstogenetic levels. Tectonic strains opened and possibly closed some fractures, allowing (or preventing) water to flow through parts of the karst massive. The structural setting, defining the overall geometry of the limestone bed, played an important role in the development of the various phases of the system. Most of the conduits appear to belong to old, deep phreatic systems. Tectonics is only one of a number of factors controlling karstification. Together with lithology, it represents the geological control. Geomorphological factors (mainly spring and catchment positions, but also erosion of the flysch cover), as well as bioclimatical factors (quantity and physico-chemical characteristics of water),and hydrodynamics and transport processes can play a significant role on the genesis of karat systems.

J	Donald, DB				Donald, DB			Relationship between year-class strength for goldeyes and selected environmental variables during the first year of life	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												I investigated the relationships between year-class strength and selected environmental variables for the migratory population of goldeye Hiodon alosoides of the Peace-Athabasca delta, Alberta, Canada. Year-class strength was highly variable from year to year. Goldeyes from the 1971 year-class dominated the catch (up to 87%) in the 1970s, and other dominant year-classes (>25% of the catch) developed in 1982 and 1989. The 1985 year-class failed completely. On average, dominant or abundant year-classes (>5% of the catch) occurred about three times per decade. Year-class strength was related to the number of warm days (mean daily temperature >15 degrees C) from May 1 to July 31, the period that covers the time from the spawning migration to the development of a 57-mm, 1.9-g juvenile goldeye (r = 0.57, P < 0.01). The semibuoyant eggs and larvae of goldeyes were present in the delta primarily from May 22 to June 20. A linear relationship was not evident between year-class strength and wind intensity during this 30-d period (r = -0.09). However, dominant and abundant year-classes usually developed in those years when this 30-d period was both warm and calm (wind intensity usually <20 km/h during the day). Year-class strength was not related to discharge of the Peace River, the winter habitat of goldeyes, or to water levels in Mamawi and Claire lakes, the spawning and rearing habitats. Density-independent mechanisms regulate recruitment in the Peace-Athabasca delta population of goldeyes.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1997	126	3					361	368		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0361:RBYCSF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0361:RBYCSF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XN04700002
J	ARNOTT, SE; VANNI, MJ				ARNOTT, SE; VANNI, MJ			ZOOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES IN FISHLESS BOG LAKES - INFLUENCE OF BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS	ECOLOGY												Some bog lakes in northern Wisconsin and Michigan lack fish because of low pH and low winter oxygen concentrations. The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.

Diagnosing the data-model mismatch can offer valuable insights about the drivers of hydrological variability and different regional sensitivities to hydroclimate forcing. Here we present a proxy-modeling synthesis for Holocene climates in the eastern North American mid-latitudes, including machine-learning-based water balance reconstructions and high-resolution climate simulations. These data-model results resolve prior-generation inconsistencies, show consistent spatiotemporal patterns of Holocene hydroclimate change, and enable assessment of the driving mechanisms. This agreement suggests that the secular summer insolation trend, combined with the Laurentide Ice Sheet deglaciation and its effect on atmospheric circulation, together explain the extent and duration of drier-than-present climates. In addition, our high-resolution proxy data and transient simulations reveal clear multi-centennial climate variability. In our simulations, temperature-driven increases in evapotranspiration exceed regional precipitation gains, drying much of the region during the mid Holocene. This suggests that the mid-Holocene multi-millennial drought was driven by similar processes compared to the drying trajectory projected for mid-latitude North America over this century, which is also primarily driven by warming.					; Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024; Dauner, Ana Lúcia/AAF-1544-2021	Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Salonen, Sakari/0000-0002-8847-9081; Williams, John/0000-0001-6046-9634; 														2041-1723				APR 15	2025	16	1							3582	10.1038/s41467-025-58685-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58685-7								40234399					WOS:001468180100011
J	Koull, N; Chehma, A				Koull, Naima; Chehma, Abdelmadjid			Soil characteristics and plant distribution in saline wetlands of Oued Righ, northeastern Algeria	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Saline wetlands are rare ecosystems in Saharan areas, which are important for conservation of many endemic and rare plant species. In this study, we investigated five saline wetland sites of the Oued Righ region, located in the northeastern Algeria, to determine the environmental factors controlling the composition and distribution of plant communities. We established a total of 20 transects to measure the vegetation parameters (density and cover) and soil characteristics (electrical conductivity, moisture, pH, CaSO4, CaCO3, organic matter, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, SO4 (2-), Cl-, NO3 (-) and HCO3 (-)). A total of 17 plant species belonging to seven families were identified. The natural vegetation was composed of halophytic and hydro-halophytic plant communities, presented specially by the species of Amaranthaceae family. Soils in the studied wetlands were moist, gypsiferous, alkaline, salty to very salty with dominance of chloride and calcium. Results of the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that community structure and species distribution patterns of vegetation were mainly dependent on soil characteristics, mainly being soil salinity (CaSO4, K+, Ca2+ and Cl-) and moisture. The distribution of plant species was found to follow a specific zonal pattern. Halocnemum strobilaceum was observed to grow in highly salt-affected soils, thus being the more salt-tolerant species. Phragmites communis plants were widely distributed in the study area with a high density at the edges of accumulated water body. Juncus maritimus, Tamarix gallica and Salicornia fructicosa grew in soils that are partially or completely flooded in winter. Suaeda fructicosa, Traganum nudatum, Arthrocnemum glaucum, Aeluropus littoralis, Cressa cretica and Cynodon dactylon were distributed in salty and moist soils away from the open water body. Plants of Zygophyllum album, Limonastrirum guyonianum, Cornulaca monacantha, Cistanche tinctoria, Mollugo nudicaulis and Sonchus maritimus were found in soils with less salty and moisture. They constituted the outermost belt of vegetation in the studied wetlands. This study will provide a reference on introducing the salt-tolerant plant species as a fodder resource in saline habitats and regenerating the degraded saline wetlands.					; KOULL, NAIMA/CAH-0878-2022; Chehma, Abdelmadjid/I-7385-2012	Naima, Koull/0000-0002-2188-2204; 													1674-6767	2194-7783				DEC	2016	8	6					948	959		10.1007/s40333-016-0060-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-016-0060-5													WOS:000386126200012

Implications of seston settling on phosphorus dynamics in three reservoirs of contrasting trophic state	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We performed a comparative study in three reservoirs based on field measurements and laboratory experiments determine the impact of seston sedimentation on phosphorus dynamics. While we found a strong relationship between the trophic state and the settling flux of dry material in the study reservoirs, an increase in the trophic state did not lead to an increase in the export ratio (fraction of the primary production lost by sinking). In laboratory experiments, the analysis of biotic and abiotic contributions to phosphate (PO43-) regeneration/uptake by the sinking particles showed that an increase in the trophic state led to a significant vertical segregation in the observed patterns. Settled matter collected in both upper and lower sediment traps exhibited similar temporal patterns in the oligotrophic reservoir (Quentar), while clear spatial differences occurred in the more eutrophic systems (Cubillas and Beznar) as result of the vertical distribution of PO43- characterizing warm monomictic eutrophic systems during summer thermal stratification. Chemical analysis of the settling matter in the oligotrophic reservoir (Quentar) showed that the sinking particles became richer in phosphorus during sedimentation, especially in the organic P pools. In contrast, P content in settling matter decreased with depth in the hypertrophic reservoir (Beznar), especially the org-P at the thermocline. This indicates that the mineralization of settling organic matter is important for maintaining high concentration of PO43- in the deeper layers. However, no significant vertical differences in P content in settled matter were detected during the whole study period.

However, the relationship between precipitation changes and rapid warming during the B-A interstadial in Northeast (NE) China has remained unclear. Here, we present a multiproxy record spanning the interval 20-10 cal ka BP from a small volcanic lake in NE China and compare it with other records from the same region to clarify the hydroclimatological history of the last deglaciation in NE China. The results suggest that precipitation lagged behind temperature increase during the B-A interstadial in NE China. We attribute this lag to the different forcings at play on the evolution of precipitation and temperature during the B-A, in which the temperature changes were forced by the recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the triggered release of stored heat in the North Atlantic from the high latitudes while the precipitation changes were controlled by increasing sea surface temperatures in the low latitudes.

J	Lorimer, CG; Dahir, SE; Nordheim, EV				Lorimer, CG; Dahir, SE; Nordheim, EV			Tree mortality rates and longevity in mature and old-growth hemlock-hardwood forests	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Efforts to understand and forecast tong-term forest dynamics are often hindered by limited data on mortality rates and longevity of trees in older stands. In this study, mortality data were analysed from 11-year permanent plot records in 10 tracts of hemlock-hardwood forest with little past human disturbance in the upper Great Lakes region, USA. 2 We compared tree size-mortality trends in mature stands (canopy trees mostly 100-170 years old) with those in true old-growth stands (canopy trees mostly 200-350 years old). Stem sections were also cut from 71 recently fallen trees to determine average and maximum longevity for canopy trees of each species. 3 All five mature stands had descending monotonic size-mortality trends for shade-tolerant species, with low rates of mortality (generally much less than 1% per year) for trees > 18 cm d.b.h. In contrast, all five old-growth stands had U-shaped mortality functions, with annual mortality rates of 1.5-2.9% for trees > 66 cm d.b.h. These size-mortality trends are biologically consistent with 'rotated sigmoid' size distributions observed for major species, although mortality rates were nearly size-invariant for trees between 18 and 66 cm d.b.h. 4 Both late-successional and gap-phase species had fairly high mortality rates for saplings (2-10 cm d.b.h.) of 25-34% over the 11-year period, which suggests that size distributions with moderately steep negative slopes are needed to compensate for mortality and ensure population sustainability. 5 Average age at time of death for canopy trees was 216 years for sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and 301 years for hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), suggesting that the biological transition from mature to old-growth forest probably doesn't occur on these sites until a stand age of about 180-250 years.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				DEC	2001	89	6					960	971		10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00619.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00619.x													WOS:000172926100005
J	CROWE, AS				CROWE, AS			THE APPLICATION OF A COUPLED WATER-BALANCE SALINITY MODEL TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF A LAKE DOMINATED BY GROUNDWATER TO CLIMATIC VARIABILITY	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A dynamic hydrologic model, specifically designed to assess lake-groundwater systems, has been used to provide insight into the effects of climatic variability on Wabamun Lake and its watershed, in Alberta, Canada. This lake is typical of many lakes in the prairies of Canada or western plains of the United States in that groundwater exhibits a dominant role in the hydrologic balance of the lake. Sensitivity analyses indicate that small changes in temperature (1-2-degrees-C rise) or precipitation (5-10% decline) throughout the watershed, may significantly impact upon the quality of the lake water and the availability of groundwater resources. Specifically, a long-term temperature rise that increases evaporation, or a decrease in precipitation, will reduce the amount of water available to recharge the groundwater-flow regime. Groundwater storage in the watershed will further decline due to continued discharge to the lake. The effect of climatic variability on the quantity of water in Wabamun Lake (as reflected by its surface elevation) is relatively small. However, the salinity of the lake will increase dramatically, due to: (1) the loss of surface runoff and direct precipitation, which act to dilute the salinity: (2) increased evaporation, which concentrates the salts left in the lake water; (3) reduced surface discharge from the lake as its surface elevation falls below the elevation of the outlet, which removes dissolved mass from the lake.																			0022-1694					JAN	1993	141	1-4					33	73		10.1016/0022-1694(93)90044-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90044-A													WOS:A1993KK97000003

The atmosphere as a source/sink of polychlorinated biphenyls to/from the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund site	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Waterbodies polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may cause the air in the surrounding area to become PCB-contaminated. Conversely, when a waterbody is located in or near an urban area, the deposition of atmospheric PCBs may act as a low-level, ongoing source of PCB contamination to that water. Distinguishing these situations is necessary to be protective of human populations and to guide efforts seeking to cleanup such aquatic ecosystems. To assess the situation at the Lower Duwamish Waterway (LDW) Superfund site, low-density polyethylene passive samplers were deployed in the summer of 2015 to quantify freely dissolved water and gaseous air concentrations of PCBs thereby enabling estimates of the direction and magnitude of air-water exchange of PCB congeners. For the sum of the 27 PCB congeners, average concentrations were 220 pg/m(3) (95% C.I.: 80-610) in the air and 320 pg/L (95% C.I.: 110-960) in the water. The sum of air-water exchange fluxes of these PCB congeners was estimated to be 68 ng/m(2)/day (95% C.I.: 30-148) into the lower atmosphere, contrasting with the reported wet and dry depositional flux of only 5.5 ng/m(2)/day (95% C.I.: 1-38) from the air into the water. Therefore, the atmosphere was ultimately a sink of PCBs from the LDW Superfund site, at least under 2015 summertime conditions. However, we conclude that air-water exchange of PCBs is likely only a minor sink of PCBs from the LDW and only a minor source of contamination to the region's local atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is difficult to measure ammonia emissions by high-frequency sampling with the chamber methods widely used in China, which is of great significance for investigating the environmental effects on the ammonia emissions. The chamber methods also can not accurately determine the ammonia emissions. In this study, the backward Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model, with ammonia concentrations continuously measured by the open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy technique, was used to determine ammonia emissions from a rice field after fertilizer application at excessive (270 kg N ha(-1)) and appropriate (210 kg N ha(-1)) rates in the Taihu Lake Region of China. High temporal resolution measurements of ammonia emissions revealed that high intraday fluctuations of ammonia emissions were significantly affected by the meteorological conditions. Multiple regression analysis showed a dominant solar radiation dependence of intraday ammonia emission cycles, especially during the rice panicle formation stage. The NH4+-N concentrations of the surface water of the rice field were found to be the decisive factor that influenced interday dynamics of ammonia emissions. Accurate quantifications of ammonia emissions indicated that the total ammonia losses under appropriate nitrogen application rate were 27.4 kg N ha(-1) during the rice tillering stage and 11.2 kg N ha(-1) during the panicle formation stage, which were 29.4% and 17.0% less than those under traditional excessive nitrogen application rate used by the local farmers, respectively. The ammonia loss proportions during the rice panicle formation stage were significantly lower than those of the tillering stage, which might be due to different nitrogen application rates and environmental effects during the two stages. This study indicated that the open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy technique could facilitate the investigation of high temporal resolution dynamic of ammonia emissions from farmland and the environmental influence on the ammonia emissions.

Differences and changes in chemical components of both water types are followed in order to detect spatial variability and impact of environmental factors. To achieve this, ion compositions of subsurface water and streams were measured at 12 sites in the catchments of Lakes Saana and Saanalampi during four years (2008-2010, and again in 2017). In the Lake Saanalampi catchment, the salinity of stream water (7.0 to 12.7 Scm(-1)) corresponded to that of snow. In the catchment of Lake Saana, however, the conductivity in stream water was much higher (40 to 220 Scm(-1)), connected mainly to the increase of SO42- and less with Mg2+ and Ca2+ contents, especially in the western part of the Saana catchment. These results demonstrate that arctic conditions do not preclude intense chemical weathering where conditions are favourable. Although chemical composition of the soil fluid does not match the geochemical signal from the local soil, rock composition, especially the presence of pyrite, is the main controller of chemical weathering rates of the rocks on the area. This supports earlier views that the character of precipitation mostly controls water chemistry of local lakes in the Kilpisjarvi area.

Diets of Longnose Sucker in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, USA	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Invasive species introduction and expansion is the second greatest threat to global biodiversity decline after habitat degradation. Introduced in the 1930s, the benthivorous Longnose Sucker (Catostomus catostomus) became established in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, USA, and used tributary streams for spawning. With this introduction, concerns were raised regarding their possible competition for food resources with native adfluvial Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri). Additionally, insufficient literature exists on Longnose Sucker feeding habits throughout their range, and there has been no comprehensive study of Longnose Sucker diet in Yellowstone Lake. The need exists for understanding the community ecology and food web dynamics in Yellowstone Lake, especially as non-native Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have caused declines in Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout through predation. The objectives of this study were to examine possible size-specific shifts in feeding habits, evaluate feeding strategy, and compare historical and contemporary diet data of Longnose Suckers in Yellowstone Lake. Diet data collected during summer of 2018 were analyzed by length-class to test for size-specific diet shifts. As Longnose Sucker length increased, copepods (Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Leptodiaptomus ashlandiorHesperodiaptomus shoshone) decreased in proportion by weight. In contrast, dipterans (Chironomidae) and amphipods (Hyalellaspp. orGammarusspp.) varied in proportion by weight in the diet across length classes. We assessed the feeding strategy by evaluating the relationship between prey-specific abundance and percent frequency of occurrence. This assessment indicates that Longnose Suckers have a heterogeneous diet and generalized feeding strategy as all prey items had a prey-specific abundance value of <50%. Diet composition differed significantly between historical and contemporary samples, likely related to the differences in sampling locations and possibly due to a Lake Trout-induced trophic cascade. This study established the diet composition and feeding habits of Longnose Suckers residing in Yellowstone Lake, thus, expanding our knowledge of Longnose Sucker feeding patterns and ecology.

Sorption-Diffusion Model of 137Cs Absorption by Bottom Deposits of Lakes in the Reconstruction of 137Cs Fallout to Water Basins	RADIOCHEMISTRY												For 6 drainless lakes with average depths of <= 12 m, the fallout of Cs-137 to water basins is reconstructed by using in calculation the sorption-diffusion model off radionuclide absorption by the bottom and the data of later (in years) monitoring of Cs-137. The model was used to calculate the concentration of Cs-137 in water by the date of lake contamination, with the subsequent determination of the amount of Cs-137 in the bulk of lake water. The manifold difference in the Cs-137 fallout density to water basins (18-700 kBq/m(2)), time of Cs-137 exposure, and dissimilar natural properties of lakes had no effect on the correction of estimating the Cs-137 fallout: the calculated results agreed with the data on the content of Cs-137 in coastal soils of water basins. By the dates of Cs-137 monitoring in lake water (7, 16, 35 years after the contamination of a water basin) its amount in the water bulk did not exceed 0.18-6.6% of the amount fallen on the lake surface. The parameters of the Cs-137 migration in the water-bottom system, the distribution (K-d) and diffusion (D) coefficient were 2000-4000 L/kg and 1.0-0.2 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s, respectively. Silts as the main examples of the sorption properties of the water basin bottom determined for many years the contamination odd rainless lakes with Cs-137.

To estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of lead in the mor layer, we use in this study from Northern Sweden three different approaches: (1) lead-210 is applied as a tracer of lead migration; (2) estimations of loss rates of stable lead (concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios) from the mor layer at an undisturbed forest setting, and (3) a study of lead in a soil series with sites of different age (a chronosequence of 20-220 years). In the last two approaches we compared measured inventories in the soil with estimated inventories derived using analyses of lake sediments. The results suggested a MRT of about 250 years in the mor layer in the mature forest and in the older parts of the chronosequence it was at least > 170 years. The agreement between the three different approaches gives good credibility to this estimate. It is also supported by a modeling of trends in the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio both between single cores and with depth in the mor layer. Our results suggest that it will take centuries for the deeper parts of the mor layer of undisturbed boreal forest soils to fully respond to decreased atmospheric lead pollution. However, data from the chronosequence indicate that the response could be much faster (MRT < 50 years) in the mor layer at early stages of forest succession where graminoid and broadleaved litter fall dominates over conifer litter.

J	Glushko, T				Glushko, T			Features of landscape structure of the coastal dunes of the East Caspian Sea	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING					International Conference on the Science and Management of Coastal Dunes (Dunes 94)	JAN 06-11, 1994	PORT ELIZABETH, SOUTH AFRICA					A band of coastal dunes on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea is found in the Middle Caspian, where plateaux of the Turan platform (Mangyshlak and Kendirli-Koyasan) come up to the shore, and in the South Caspian, bordering with the West-Turkmenian lowland, situated in the inter-mountain depression of alpine folding. Coastal dunes of the Middle and South Caspian were created like barrier islands, which attached to the shore during sea-level fall and separated lagoons from the sea. Later, these lagoons were divided into small salt lakes which dried out and chan ed into solonchaks. In spite of the general method of development of coastal dunes, there are some differences in the landscape structure of the dunes of the plateau and those of the lowland. For example, on the shore of the plateau the main shore developing fluctuations are waves, whereas on the shore of the lowland, wind-induced surges and, to a lesser extent waves, are the driving force. The elevation of the coastal dunes is higher and their surface is wider on the lowland shore. The surface of dry solonchaks is also higher here. On the shore of the plateau rapid sea-level rise causes destruction of old patches and the creation of new ones. On the shore of the lowland this leads to transformation of old patches, located in the zone of sea/land interaction.																			0169-2046					MAY	1996	34	3-4					183	188		10.1016/0169-2046(95)00222-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(95)00222-7													WOS:A1996UT15800003

Rates of dissolved inorganic C (DIC = CO2 + HCO3- + CO32-) and maximum NO3- uptake were phased with the diel high light/low light regime characteristic of the brief arctic summer with the amplitude of oscillation greater for DIC than for NO3-. NH4+ uptake was continuous at uptake-saturating concentrations. No conclusive evidence was found for a diel periodicity in nitrogenous nutrient levels or uptake of NO3- and NH4+ ambient concentrations. A pronounced light-temperature effect on dissolved inorganic N (DIN = NO3- + NH4+) uptake was evident at depth when rates of uptake were maximum. Depth-integrated daily C/N uptake ratios (mol) estimated as the mean of 4 consecutive 6 h incubations ranged from 1.8-6.4 under conditions of substrate saturation and from 6.0-16.1 at ambient levels of DIN. The efficacy of 24 h incubations to estimate accurately day-rates of DIC and substrate-saturated DIN uptake was assessed by comparing estimates obtained from 24 h exposures to those approximated by summing results from serial short-term incubations. Experiments of 24 h duration accurately predicted day-rates of maximum NO3- uptake but underestimated daily DIC uptake by 13 .+-. 7% (.hivin.x SD). Day-length incubations introduced serious errors in the estimation of day-rates of maximum NH4+ uptake, effecting an underestimation of 29 .+-. 5% (.hivin.x .+-.

We conducted surveys on the lower Colorado River from Princess Cove on Lake Mohave to the Bill Williams River confluence and upstream on the Bill Williams River to Planet Ranch from 1987 through 2002, and we consulted museums and herpetologists working in the area for P. regilla localities. We found this frog to be well distributed along 90 km of the lower Colorado River and its backwaters from Davis Camp, just below Davis Dam, to Castle Rock in upper Lake Havasu. We report 33 new localities and confirmed presence at 1 historical site. We found P regilla primarily in cattail and bulrush marshes along the main channel and in backwaters. What limits its distribution on the lower Colorado River is unknown, because cattail and bulrush marshes occur both north and south of the current range. Pseudacris regilla populations below Davis Dam are probably currently disjunct from those on the Overton Arm of Lake Mead and in the Las Vegas Valley. In Arizona, this species also has been recorded as an apparent introduction at Middle Spring and a nearby stock tank in the Virgin Mountains, Mohave County, and at 2 central Arizona plant nurseries. The species persisted for at least 19 years and successfully bred at 1 nursery, where it was reportedly introduced by frogs hitchhiking on ornamental plants imported from San Diego.

J	Löfgren, A; Jerling, L				Löfgren, A; Jerling, L			Regional dynamics and dispersal in the vascular plant Silene viscosa (L.) inhabiting small islands	ECOGRAPHY												We investigated and compared the patch occupancy and colonisation and extinction over a 40-yr period in the vascular plant Silene viscosa in two archipelagos off the Swedish east coast. We also assessed the importance of regional vs local dynamics for regional persistence by examining factors affecting colonisation and extinction processes. We found an effect of isolation on the patch occupancy in 1957, but this effect disappeared 1997. The effect of isolation was not detected when analysing colonisations and extinctions during the 40-yr period separately, which suggests that the colonisations and extinctions since 1957 have changed the patch occupancy of S. viscosa. The change in the patch occupancy is attributed to an increased colonisation, presumably mediated by the increase of the greylag goose Anser anser. The large amplitude of population size change, the high persistence of populations during a 40-yr period, and the long term persistence for some populations all suggest that the distribution pattern approximates a distribution that is expected to be generated from an Island-Mainland model, where a number of large populations are persistent and a number of smaller populations are more prone to extinction due to catastrophes (nesting cormorants) and environmental stochasticity (summer drought). Most evidence suggests that regional processes are of less importance than local processes for regional persistence on a time scale of 40 yr for S. viscosa.																			0906-7590					APR	2003	26	2					171	178		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03177.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03177.x													WOS:000182801400006

Therefore, to address the context relevant to this challenge, planning based on measured information from land use patterns is required. Based on land use and land cover (LULC), this study evaluates the landscape ecological risk (LER) of the Selenga River Basin by calculating the landscape pattern index. The spatiotemporal pattern and influencing factors of landscape ecological risk in the Selenga River Basin from 1990 to 2040 were analyzed. According to the results of LULC analysis, forest and grassland were the primary land use types in the Selenga River Basin. The built area, forest, and cropland showed an increasing trend, while the grassland area showed a fluctuating decreasing trend. From 1990 to 2010, the comprehensive land use dynamic degree showed a trend of rising first and then falling, specifically from 0.13% in 1990 to 0.29% in 2010, and will drop to 0.06% by 2040, indicating that the range of land use change is becoming more and more stable. The landscape ecological risk assessment shows a distribution pattern of "low at the edge and high in the middle". The landscape ecological risk index (LER) first increases and then decreases, with the peak value in 2010 (0.085). By calculating the spatial aggregation of LER and the partial correlation with climate, we found that the Moran's I index showed an "anti-V"-shaped change trend from 1990 to 2040, and the average landscape ecological risk presents positive spatial correlation, primarily with high-value aggregation, and peaked in 2010. Precipitation had a negative correlation with landscape ecological risk controlling for temperature, while there was a positive relationship between temperature and landscape ecological risk under the influence of controlling precipitation.

A.; de Winter, Ilja L.; Overeem, Irina; Drijkoningen, Guy G.; Lykke-Andersen, Holger			The Holocene sedimentary history of the Kangerlussuaq Fjord-valley fill, West Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												West Greenland has been intensively studied to reconstruct and better understand past relative sea level changes and deglacial history. This study extends these efforts by linking sea level and deglacial history to the sedimentary infill successions of Kangerlussuaq Fjord and associated landward valleys. Based on published and new land- and sea-based geophysical data, radiocarbon dates and geological observations we have characterized the infill and reconstructed the sedimentation history during the Holocene. Based on a revised sea level curve and data presented in this paper we defined three depositional phases. Phase I (>7000 yr BP) is represented by dominant glaciomarine deposition associated with a tide-water glacier system. As the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) continued to retreat it became land based. During phase II (7000-1500 yr BP) two separate depocenters formed. Keglen delta depocenter arose from a temporary stabilization phase of the GIS and prograded rapidly over the glaciomarine deposits of Phase I. Further inland, proglacial lake formation and subsequent sedimentary infill associated with the ongoing GIS retreat is represents the second depocenter. The Watson River connected both depocenters by a flood plain which transferred sediment from the GIS to the Keglen delta. Ongoing sea level fall due to glacio-isostastic uplift combined with a gradually cooler and dryer climate resulted in terrace formation along the Watson River flood plain. Around 4000 yr BP, the GIS margin reached its most landward location and began to advance to its present location. The final phase (Phase III; <1500 yr BP) is represented by a stabilized GIS position and a relative sea level rise which led to aggrading conditions near the present-day delta plain of Watson River. Simultaneously, subaqueous channels were formed at the delta front by hyperpycnal flows associated with jokulhlaup events. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Palaeoecological Analyses Reveal Recent Fires Have Destroyed Late-Holocene Peat Deposits in Tasmania's Largest Ramsar Reserve	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Australian peat-forming wetlands are some of the most biodiverse in Oceania. King Island, the second largest offshore island from mainland Tasmania, has the largest Ramsar-wetland area in Tasmania-the Lavinia State Reserve (LSR). The reserve has been under threat of peat loss from swamps over past decades due to wildfires, deforestation and drainage. To provide a framework and baseline to assess the resilience or susceptibility to future climate change and fire impacts at the LSR, we apply a palaeoecological approach to understand Holocene peat dynamics in two different LSR wetlands. This contributes to resolving the dynamics and rate of peat loss, thereby assisting in prioritising areas for further swamp conservation actions. Both LSR wetlands were once lakes, and peat accumulation only started due to terrestrialisation during a period of low water levels and drought in the Mid-Holocene. Fires have resulted in the loss of at least 4000 years' worth of accumulated peat in the largest peat-forming swamp, with the greatest loss likely linked to summer fires in the LSR in the 2000s. This finding shows the long-term vulnerability of the LSR wetlands to climate and fire impact, underscoring the need for effective fire management to conserve the remaining peat through fire control and careful hydrological management.

The selected lakes were analyzed concerning various types of antropopressure, e.g., relatively low, medium, and huge human impact including sewage inflow history, different hydrological regime nature as natural phenomenon of flow-through lakes and as a consequence of artificial including into water-cooling system with short retention time, and different restoration actions (biomanipulation and artificial aeration). Smaller biomass and more varied structure of phytoplankton (co-dominated by Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, Miozoa, and Cyanobacteria) were typical of the PEG Model for mesotrophic or even oligotrophic temperate lakes with lower trophy level. On the contrary, a large biomass with Cyanobacteria domination in summer was typical in more eutrophied lakes. The prominent dominants were primarily chroococcalean Microcystis aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii and filamentous Planktolyngbya limnetica, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Limnothrix redekei, and Planktothrix agardhii. Species richness and values of biodiversity index were usually higher in more eutrophied lakes than in mesotrophic lakes. The overall relationships of phytoplankton groups with environmental variables indicated that water transparency in less eutrophied lakes while water temperature and nutrient concentrations in more eutrophied lakes induced phytoplankton growth.

Stable isotopic composition of rice grain organic matter marking an abrupt shift of hydroclimatic condition during the cultural transformation of Harappan civilization	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Several hypotheses have been proposed to solve the conundrum of the cause of transition of Harappan civilization to a de-urbanized form in its Late Phase. In view of this, high-resolution off-site palaeoclimatic records along with archaeological findings provide strong evidence of an abrupt climate change similar to 4000 yr BP (before present) that coincides with the civilization's cultural transition. The present study investigates whether this climatic shift recorded in palaeoclimate archives (speleothem, lake and marine sediments) at remote locations can be traced to the human settlements of Harappan civilization. This was accomplished by analyzing the remains of rice cereal-a highly water sensitive crop. The analysis involved measuring carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions (delta C-13, delta N-15) of well-preserved rice grains recovered from archaeological sites belonging to the Harappan civilization and other contemporary regional cultures, representing the time windows between 4520 and 3400 yr BP. The parameter of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) was used as an index for water availability in the rice crop's growth environment and was ascertained based on delta C-13 values measured in the bulk grain organic matter (OM). The observed WUEi values ranged between 49 and 69 mu mol mol(-1) and captured the variation in water availability. The delta N-15 values ranged from 5 parts per thousand to 6.5 parts per thousand, thereby allowing us to confirm the role of climate in controlling delta C-13 variation in the archaeological grains. The present findings will extend the usage of archaeobotanical cereal remains to deduce environmental changes at human settlements and will further our understanding of the process of Harappan cultural adaptation in response to decline in southwest monsoon at the Middle-Late Holocene boundary.					; Kaushal, Ritika/GON-6708-2022	Kaushal, Ritika/0000-0003-2140-7064; Pokharia, Anil/0000-0003-1453-0646; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				APR 10	2019	512						144	154		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.04.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.04.017													WOS:000469032200012

(2) The bolling (BO) amelioration (ca. 13,000 to ca. 12,300 BP) with a Salix shrub dominance on humus soils. (3) The 'Older Dryas' (OD) deterioration (ca. 12,300 to ca. 12,000 BP) with a recurrence of herb dominance. (4) The Allerod (AL) amelioration (ca. 12,000 to ca. 11,000 BP) with the re-establishment of Salix shrubs. Two minor climatic deteriorations are traced at about 11,750 and 11,300 BP. (5) The Younger Dryas (YD) Stadial (ca. 11,000 to ca. 10, 000 BP) with a dominance of Sedum and other mineral-soil herbs. (6) The early Holocene with locally established woodlands of birch, hazel and Populus. July means of 7-10-degrees-C in the pleniglacial, 12-14-degrees-C in the from B-phi to AL, 10-degrees-C in the first half of YD, 12-14-degrees-C in the last half, and at least 14-16-degrees-C in the early Holocene are indicated. Strong winds may have prevailed throughout the Late-glacial, inhibiting woodland development. In periods of climatic deterioration, cold winters and increased wind activity are suggested as the main factors deleterious to humus-soil vegetation. Boreal-circumpolar, arctic-alpine, and eurasiatic plants dominated the Late-glacial flora.					paus, aage/AAJ-8096-2020														0029-196X						1990	70	3					135	152																WOS:A1990EQ28800001
J	Tonder, M; Jurvelius, J				Tonder, M; Jurvelius, J			Attitudes towards fishery and conservation of the Saimaa ringed seal in Lake Pihlajavesi, Finland	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												The Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis) is the only endemic mammal in Finland. At present the total population size of this subspecies is c. 250 individuals. Because the seal feeds on fish, and because of its value particularly as a source of meat, oil and leather, hunting was allowed until 1955. Conservation of the seal and some of its lairing areas by means of fishing restrictions requires the adoption of new attitudes. Semi-structured interviews elucidated the basis of conflicts concerning protection of the Saimaa ringed seal and fishing in Lake Pihlajavesi, Finland, where one of the most viable populations of the seal lives. Socio-economic position largely determined personal attitudes towards conservation; local landowners felt that their use of natural resources was restricted, while summer cottage owners wanted strict conservation. Commercial fishers considered the protection of the ringed seal unnecessary and a waste of money. Conservation biologists believed that the proposed actions were necessary to reduce the risk of extinction. Attitudes were also widely influenced by culture and social backgrounds. Those influenced by the traditional Finnish peasant/nature relationship had a different vision of nature from the conservationists who were influenced by modern science. Questions raised by the protection of the Saimaa ringed seal form an example of transition of an environmental conflict to larger-scale criticism of ongoing structural transformation in society. It is obvious that if nature conservation requires the approval of all social groups, it needs a change of authoritarian measures and acceptance of local knowledge, which should be used alongside scientific knowledge in management. Nature conservation policy led by specialists and authorities could be seen as widening the gap between urban and rural areas.																			0376-8929	1469-4387				JUN	2004	31	2					122	129		10.1017/S0376892904001201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892904001201													WOS:000223385000004

Pollutants from agricultural waste including pesticides and fertilizers as well as other effluents of industrial activities and runoffs certainly will pass into the biotic elements of the ecosystem, This report presents the status of inorganic pollutants including anions, cations, and trace metals in the two lakes and the surrounding springs of Wadi El Raiyan using ion chromatography, ion-selective electrodes, and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, The report also includes the levels of selected metals in the vegetation community of the area. The result of this investigation revealed a great improvement in water quality of the Wadi El Raiyan lakes compared to 1988 report by Saleh et nl, Mercury was not detected in any of the samples and the level of lead was significantly reduced, Cadmium levels were much higher than those seen earlier. The higher level of cadmium might be used as an indicator to track the contamination of water by human waste. Concentrations of common anions were not significantly different from those reported earlier, However, an increase in the level of cyanide was observed. Levels of heavy metals in vegetation around the lakes were also found to be lower than previously reported.

J	VANBANNING, P				VANBANNING, P			OBSERVATIONS ON BONAMIASIS IN THE STOCK OF THE EUROPEAN FLAT OYSTER, OSTREA-EDULIS, IN THE NETHERLANDS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LAKE GREVELINGEN	AQUACULTURE												The stock of the oyster Ostrea edulis in the Netherlands is located in an estuary on two sites, Yerseke Bank and Grevelingen. The Yerseke Bank became infected with the protozoan oyster pathogen Bonamia ostreae in 1980, as a result of importations of infected oysters from France. Due to bonamiasis, the oyster production of the Yerseke Bank suffered increasing losses and finally ceased because of lack of commercial possibilities. The oyster stock of the Grevelingen has been checked since 1980 and was found to be free of bonamiasis until 1988. In the summer of that year the first presence of bonamiasis was observed. A rapid spread, with increasing prevalences, followed, both in wild stock and in commercial stocks. In 1989 maximum prevalence levels of 48% and maximum prevalences of dead oysters up to 80% were reached. The bonamiasis situation is considered serious for Dutch Ostrea edulis production in the coming years. A 5-year research programme has been started to monitor the spread of bonamiasis in the wild stock of the Grevelingen and to select the best management strategy for commercial production of O. edulis despite bonamiasis. From the first results it was concluded that bonamiasis was introduced into the Grevelingen by transport of infectious material, probably by ships. Further, it was concluded that the level of prevalence and development of bonamiasis is related in some way to (fishery) stress factors of the oysters and to environmental factors, but stocking density does not appear to affect the prevalence of bonamiasis.																			0044-8486					MAR 15	1991	93	3					205	211		10.1016/0044-8486(91)90232-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(91)90232-V													WOS:A1991FE13800002
J	Chen, WR; Liu, N; Lindenschmidt, KE; Swallow, C				Chen, Wenrui; Liu, Ning; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Swallow, Chris			Feasibility of using continuous, stiff materials for reinforcing freshwater ice covers	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												Winter roads are economical and effective means of providing reliable transportation links to remote regions. Operators establishing ice crossings over rivers and lakes have been facing increased pressure to deliver higher volumes of goods, larger loads, in challenging climatic conditions. A question arose from industry: "is there a way to safely provide additional bearing capacity in ice covers and assist with extending operating seasons, possibly through reinforcing the ice?" This study investigated this operational challenge by developing a model to simulate ice reinforcement theories using ANSYS computer modeling techniques. ANSYS 18.0 was utilized to successfully model reinforced ice covers and estimate the ice deflection under a centrally concentrated load. ANSYS computer models allow us to learn complex behaviours of materials and provide a more accurate estimation of deflection compared to the analytical method, which provides a closed-form solution to a given problem. The results show that the reinforcing material is able to stiffen the ice cover which enables a larger surface area to carry the load; a higher percentage of the reinforcement by volume further reduces ice deflection. The test results also indicate that the reinforcing material must be considerably stiffer than the ice so that the load can be more efficiently transferred from the ice to the reinforcing material. The results highlight a successful modelling of reinforced ice covers and discuss the feasibility of installing the reinforcing material, through an example using wood as a possible reinforcing material because it is readily available on site and meets a number of pre-determined criteria. While the creation of an ice reinforcement modeling tool was a success, further research is needed to verify the feasibility of using a variety of materials as reinforcement to increase the safe bearing capacity of ice covers as well as evaluate different applications and orientations of the reinforcement to achieve the best outcome. All of this bearing in mind that the reinforcement must be able to be safely installed in situ within the ice cover. Moreover, a collection of actual ice deflections in the field is recommended to further assist in calibrating the ANSYS model. The simulations serve as an initial step in evaluating different reinforcement materials and methodologies. Subsequent research will need to evaluate the modelling in controlled, full-scale field applications prior to providing a tested solution for commercial use.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal distribution of these blooms in the main body of Poyang Lake. Specifically, we addressed the hypothesis that colonies of cyanobacteria are first generated in the Eastern Bay (EB, lentic region) and then advected offshore by large-scale horizontal transport processes, with the colonies subsequently found in Northern Poyang Lake (NPL, lotic region). The cyanobacteria biomass in the EB was significantly greater than that in NPL (P < 0.0001), and negative correlations were observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in the EB. However, significant correlations were not observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in NPL. The peak abundance of cyanobacteria was first observed in the EB, with the cyanobacterial abundance peak in NPL lagging the EB peak by approximately 1 month. These results are all consistent with the cyanobacteria distribution hypothesis and show the potential for the accumulation of cyanobacteria in NPL that are normally considered unsuitable for in situ growth in EB. Variations of cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes, including Yangtze-connected (Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake) and Yangtze-isolated (Taihu) lakes, were monitored during summer (July-August), and eutrophic or even polytrophic conditions were not observed to support the development of cyanobacteria. Instead, a high rate of water flow with short retention times was the key factor preventing the accumulation of cyanobacteria in these eutrophic lakes. Therefore, the mean cyanobacteria biomass was significantly lower in the Yangtze-connected lakes (Poyang Lake, 1.01 mg l(-1); Dongting Lake, 1.71 mg l(-1)) than in Taihu Lake at Meiliang Bay (13.54 mg l(-1)) or the mouth (3.45 mg l(-1)) (P < 0.0001); however, the biomass more closely resembled Taihu Lake at the center (0.88 mg l(-1)). As expected, the cyanobacteria biomass was lower in the lakes with hydraulic connections to the Yangtze River compared with those isolated from the Yangtze River. This study revealed that hydrological parameters dominated the accumulation of cyanobacterial blooms in the Yangtze-connected eutrophic lakes in eastern China.

Spatial and temporal variation in marking rates and severity of sea lamprey attacks on salmonines in Lakes Michigan and Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The United States and Canada have invested substantial effort to control sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Laurentian Great Lakes and to estimate their effects on lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, a native salmonine undergoing rehabilitation. However, sea lamprey also attack Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and brown trout Salmo trutta, which contribute to a fishery worth nearly $7 billion USD annually. Marks on surviving hosts are used to assess damages caused by sea lamprey and success of control efforts. We examined spatial and temporal variation in marking rates, mark type, and stage of healing on lake trout, Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, rainbow trout O. mykiss, coho salmon O. kisutch, and brown trout in Lakes Michigan and Huron. Mean marking rates were highest for lake trout, followed by brown trout, Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and coho salmon in Lake Michigan, but were several times higher for Chinook salmon than for lake trout (all sizes) and small (533-635 mm) and medium (636-737 mm) rainbow trout in Lake Huron, particularly in summer. Chinook salmon had a lower proportion of healed marks relative to fresh marks compared to lake trout in both lakes, which may indicate differences in post-attack survival. Although lake trout may be the preferred sea lamprey host, Chinook salmon and other species are also suitable and available in Lake Michigan; and Chinook salmon may be a preferred host in Lake Huron. Accounting for alternate hosts could inform fisheries management and improve damage assessments of the sea lamprey control program.

Even though the lake experienced several hydrothermal eruptions, the maximum depth became shallower (182 in) than before (200 in), resulting in a reduced lake volume (3.0 x 10(7) m(3)). Fifty-two major and minor constituents including rare earth elements and polythionates (PT) of the lake waters at various depths were determined by ICP-AES, ICP-MS and HPLC, respectively. These ions except for several volatile elements are taken up by lake fringe through congruent dissolution of pyroclastics of Kawah Ijen volcano. Most ions are homogeneously distributed throughout the lake, although PT showed a considerable vertical variation. Rare earth elements (REE) in the Kawah Ijen water as well as those from other hyper-acidic crater lakes show distribution patterns likely due to the three rock dissolution (preferential, congruent and residual) types, and their logarithmic concentrations linearly depend upon the pH values of the lake waters. Using the PT degradation kinetics data, production rates of PT, injection rates of SO2 and H2S into the lake were estimated to be 114, 86 and 30 tons/day, respectively. Also travel time of the spring water at the Banyupahit Riverhead from Kawah Ijen was estimated to be 600 - 1000 days through the consideration of decreasing rates of PT. Molten sulfur stocks containing Sn, Cu, Bi sulfides and Pb-barite exposed on the inner crater slope were presumed to be extinct molten sulfur pools at the former lake bottom. This was strongly supported by the barite precipitation temperature estimated through the consideration of the temperature dependence of Pb-chlorocomplex formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tyson, PD; Odada, EO; Partridge, TC				Tyson, PD; Odada, EO; Partridge, TC			Late Quaternary environmental change in southern Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Over the last 400 000 years, the pattern of climatic change in the southern African sector of the southern hemisphere is shown to have followed in broad outline that defined by the Vostock ice-core sequence. Regional-local differences are apparent in the inshore ocean sediment core record taken from the continental shelf off Namibia and probably relate to little-understood local processes. Clear evidence of precessional Milankovitch forcing of climate is evident for the subcontinent over the last 200 000 years. The Last Glacial Maximum was cool and dry over most of non-equatorial southern Africa, when the semi-permanent subtropical anticyclone dominating the atmospheric circulation was displaced equatorward. At the time, Lake Victoria was dry. Post-glacial warming culminated in the Holocene altithermal, which reached its maximum earlier than 6000 sp. Lake Victoria began to fill rapidly and overflowed at around 7500 sp. Rapid speciation of local fishes occurred in the lake at an unprecedented rate. Over the last 6000 years, robust, spatially representative high-resolution speleothem records from the summer rainfall region of the southern part of the subcontinent reveal that a high degree of variability prevailed on centennial to decadal scales. Abrupt changes, often over decades, are a feature of the record. Whereas maximum heating in the altithermal occurred before 6000 ep, the greatest extent of grass cover characterized the landscape at around 2400-2000 sp. In the last six millennia, the most pronounced and sustained event was the five centuries of cooling during the Little Ice Age from no 1300 to 1800.																			0038-2353	1996-7489				MAR-APR	2001	97	3-4					139	150																WOS:000169290600015
J	Zukofsky, L				Zukofsky, Louis			LOUIS ZUKOFSKY 4 other countries	EUROPE-REVUE LITTERAIRE MENSUELLE												In 1957, Louis Zukofsky spent the summer in Europe with his wife Celia and his daughter Paul, then aged 14. Landing in Plymouth in June, they crisscrossed England, France and Italy before taking the boat back to Le Havre after a detour through Switzerland: Meny England, La Belle France, the land of antichi and that of mountain pastures and plowing. For his grand tour of European culture, Zukofsky favors places associated with his favorite authors and those whose names resound throughout the Cantos: Stonehenge, Bristol, Wells, Worcester, Newcastle (where Zukofsky finds the English poet Basil Bunting), Stratford-upon-Avon, Durham, London (where he visits T S. Eliot), Paris (where Ossip Zadkine is missing), Mont Saint-Michel and Chartres (which had supplied Henry Adams at the same time that Pound had the opportunity to present his vision of the Middle Ages), Perigord on the French Riviera, Rapallo (where Zukofsky had visited Pound in 1933, via Marsala 12), Siena, Florence (where Zukofsky met Cid Gorman who published "A"-4-12 in 1959), Rome, Ravenna, Venice, Verona, Sirmione and Lake Garda (three places associated with Catullus), Milan, Geneva, Paris, Le Havre. To compose this elliptical travel story once he returns to New York, Zukofsky invents a form where the narrative thread unfolds in brief quatrains. We give 113 of the 219 quatrains which make up 4 other countries (1958), the longest of the short poems.																			0014-2751					MAR	2024		1139					282	297																WOS:001207868500043

Only two such CI chondrites have so far been discovered i.e. Y-86029 and Y-82162. Thermal metamorphism in these chondrites is apparent in their low contents of H2O, C and the most thermally labile trace elements, partial dehydration of matrix phyllosilicates and abundance of thermally decomposed Ca-Mg-Fe-Mn carbonates, which apparently resulted from heating of Mg-Fe carbonate precursors. The CM chondrites exhibit a wide range of aqueous and thermal alteration characteristics. This alteration was almost complete in Y-86720 and Y-86789, which also escaped alternating episodes of oxidation and sulfidization experienced by the others. Thermal metamorphism in the CM chondrites is apparent in loss of thermally labile trace elements and also in partial to almost complete dehydration of matrix phyllosilicates: heating was less uniform in them than in CI chondrites. This dehydration is also evident in strength and shapes of integrated intensities of the 3 mu m bands except in PCA 91008, which experienced extensive terrestrial weathering. Tochilinite is absent in all but Y-793321 probably due to heating. Textural evidence for thermal metamorphism is conspicuous in blurring or integration/fusion of chondrules with matrix in the more extensively heated (>= 600 degrees C) CM chondrites like PCA 91008 and B-7904. TEM and XRD analyses reveal that phyllosilicate transformation to anhydrous phases proceeds via poorly crystalline, highly desiccated and disordered 'intermediate' phases in the least and moderately heated (400-600 degrees C) carbonaceous chondrites like WIS 91600, PCA 91008 and Y-86029. These findings are significant in that they confirm that these phases occur in meteorites as well as terrestrial samples. Thermal alteration in these meteorites can be used to identify other carbonaceous chondrites that were thermally metamorphosed in their parent bodies. Combining RNAA trace element data for experimentally heated Murchison CM2 samples with petrographic and spectroscopic data, these thermally metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrites can be ordered by severity of open system heating as 400 degrees C <= Y-793321 < WIS91600 = EET90043 = A881655 < PCA91008 < B-7904 = Y-86029 < Y-82162 < Y-86720 = Y-86789 >= 700 degrees C. Nearly all heated carbonaceous chondrites discovered so far have been found in Antarctica, which is known to have sampled the flux of near-Earth material for much longer than exemplified by current falls.

Bernhart; McBrearty, Sally			Tufa as a record of perennial fresh water in a semi-arid rift basin, Kapthurin Formation, Kenya	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Lithological and biological features of a fossiliferous tufa in the Kapthurin Formation, Baringo, Kenya, reveal the presence of a lush wetland in a semi-arid environment during the Middle Pleistocene (ca 500 ka) in this portion of the East African Rift Valley. Four geological sections, each between 3 m and 8 m in thickness, exposed over a distance of 0.5 km, reveal a 1 to 2 m thick paludal tufa which is composed of three carbonate beds, two dark grey silty claystones and a reddish-brown silty palaeosol. High resolution stratigraphic analysis, carbonate petrography, stable isotope and elemental geochemistry, clay mineralogy and fossil remains (molluscs, ostracods, diatoms and charophytes) reveal a ground water-fed system that fluctuated in depth and periodically disappeared altogether. Oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of tufa matrix range from -4.5 parts per thousand to -8.0 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and become more positive up section, indicating the decreasing influence of fault-related fluids and increasing residence time or freshness of wetland water, rather than evaporative enrichment. This spring was situated on a lake margin during low lake levels, thrived during periods of increased ground water input and was ultimately replaced by an alkaline lake. The wetland would appear to have existed during a cool interval within the generally warm Marine Isotope Stage 13 or perhaps during the warm second half of Marine Isotope Stage 13. The ground water source of this wetland arose through a fault system. Thus, the position of the tufa deposit is controlled structurally but the timing and duration of the wetland system may have been influenced by both climatic and tectonic factors.

Such organisms as Phyto and zooplankton, which constitute the basis for trophic chains, are susceptible to the impact. The complex load has certain patterns of the spatial distribution of coastal geosystems with different stages of degression as a result of the direct recreational impact on natural hydrological monuments. Studying basic patterns of anthropogenic succession in lake agroecosystem, exploring Phyto and zooplankton communities, revealing natural and anthropogenic factors that determine their life cycles, and stating relationships between separate indices of a hydrological state of the lakes in South Ural and an anthropogenic load of geocomplexes near-by are of the utmost importance, especially for natural hydrological monuments. The purpose of this study is to carry out the zoning of the coastal landscape and recreational zones and the ecological state of the coastal territories of tectonic lakes at various spatial levels. For the study, complex water samples were taken in the summer of 2020 and 2021. To determine the trophic status, methods were used that included several criteria. They are the taxonomic structure and biomass of zooplankton, some hydroecological indices, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). It was determined that the natural basis for recreation is areas, mesogeosystems, and facies (on the example of tectonic lakes), with territorial formations where recreation facilities are formed playing the key role. The catchment areas of the studied lakes are more often represented by several landscapes and localities consisting of several dozen tracts.

It harbors winter birds and globally threatened bird species. The wetlands in the area are nesting places of Wattled and Black Crowned Cranes. The wetlands are being converted into different land uses; however, how much area of these wetlands is being converted into different land uses is not known yet. This study therefore investigated the land-use change of the main nesting place of cranes in Chimba and Yiganda wetlands, in the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve area. The land-use cover change was estimated by analyzing satellite images (Landsat images-ETM + from USGS website) from 1986 to 2016. The result showed that in 1986, the Chimba wetland area covered a total of 15,134,974.6 m(2), which is 7.4% of the total area of Chimba watershed (203,312,456.3 m(2)). Other land use land cover types in the study area namely cultivated land covered 31.9%; farm village 2.1%, natural forest 41.3% and grass land 17.3%. However, the land-use land cover change (LULC) in 2016 showed that the wetland coverage declined to 10,708,894 m(2). About 27.6% of the wetland is converted completely into cultivated land. Yiganda watershed covered about 28,075,506 m(2) in 1986 of which 5,351,641.7 m(2) was wetland area; however, the wetland area has shrunk to 4,668,162.9 m(2). When it is compared to the wetland change in 1986 to 2016, Chimba wetland was more affected in which 663.5 ha was changed into another land-use land cover; whereas in Yiganda it was about 137.2 ha changed during the last 30 years. When the exponential trend change of LULC is observed, it could affect crane ecology by reducing the habitat availability for cranes nesting spaces.

J	Brasil, J; Ferreira, ME; Cardoso, MRD				Brasil, Joildes; Ferreira, Manuel Eduardo; Dias Cardoso, Murilo Raphael			Evaluation of the permanent preservative areas of the metropolitan region of Goiania-GO from legal analysis and geographical information system	CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA												Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) are spaces specially protected by law, through the Brazilian Forest Code (CFB). These spaces, despite being environmentally fragile, play important ecosystem functions, especially the protection of water resources. However, the irregular use of APPs in rural and urban environments is becoming increasingly common, as in the case of the Metropolitan Region of Goiania (RMG), Goias. Given this problem, this article provides an assessment of the situation of PPAs that understand RMG, from the use of remote sensing data and geographic information systems, as strategic tools for decision making processes and management of these spaces. The cartographic products (maps of use and occupation, APPs and conflict of use in APPs) allowed to identify the predominance of cultivated pastures in almost 45% of all mapped APPs (river, springs, lakes and lagoons). In the current scenario, the non-compliance with what is foreseen in the BFC is perceived in all member municipalities of this region, with degradation percentages greater than 40% of APPs. Therefore, attention is drawn mainly to the consequences of this process of de -characterization of protected areas on the quality and quantity of water resources in the research area, which has been experiencing water shortage since 2017, to the point that in 2018 and 2019, the government of Goias declared a state of water crisis in the RMG. In this sense, it is increasingly urgent a noter position of the Government to regularize these spaces, given the irregular occupation mainly by the use of pastures.																			1958-9212						2020	45									10.4000/confins.29242	http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/confins.29242													WOS:000600281500017

Holocene tephrostratigraphic framework and monsoon evolution of East Asia: Key tephra beds for synchronising palaeoclimate records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In East Asia our understanding of Holocene climate change, forcing mechanisms and propagation, require the precise chronological control of palaeoclimate records to allow robust integration of data sets. The existing chronologies, predominantly based on C-14 method, however, are not sufficient to constrain key questions about abrupt climate shifts that occur within a century in the transitions between states. Widely dispersed tephra layers allow precise dating and synchronisation of sedimentary archives, providing a chronological framework for integrating records, especially where the visible tephra record is complemented by the addition of cryptotephra (non-visible ash). Despite significant tephra studies in this region, however, a comprehensive Holocene tephra framework is not available. To address this issue, we carry out a thorough review on Holocene tephra investigations undertaken in Japan. Using widespread tephra beds we present an integrated tephra framework and suggest the way forward for establishing this as a wider approach for East Asia. The framework is based on twenty-two ash layers that are mainly from Japan, and to a lesser extent China/N Korea, S Korea and Russia. Each tephra is assessed in terms of chronology, geochemistry and distribution. The framework is compared with high resolution palaeoclimate records from East Asia. Using this we demonstrate regional variations in monsoon evolution and more importantly, the potential of tephra isochrons in constraining such variations. Given the scarce identification of tephra layers in those well-resolved palaeoclimate records, we advocate a more systematic employment of the cryptotephra method, which would potentially lead to a significant advance in East Asian tephrochronology and the correlation of palaeoclimate archives in the region.

Satellite remote sensing to assess cyanobacterial bloom frequency across the United States at multiple spatial scales	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Cyanobacterial blooms can have negative effects on human health and local ecosystems. Field monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms can be costly, but satellite remote sensing has shown utility for more efficient spatial and temporal monitoring across the United States. Here, satellite imagery was used to assess the annual frequency of surface cyanobacterial blooms, defined for each satellite pixel as the percentage of images for that pixel throughout the year exhibiting detectable cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial frequency was assessed across 2,196 large lakes in 46 states across the continental United States (CONUS) using imagery from the European Space Agency's Ocean and Land Colour Instrument for the years 2017 through 2019. In 2019, across all satellite pixels considered, annual bloom frequency had a median value of 4% and a maximum value of 100%, the latter indicating that for those satellite pixels, a cyanobacterial bloom was detected by the satellite sensor for every satellite image considered. In addition to annual pixel-scale cyanobacterial frequency, results were summarized at the lake- and state-scales by averaging annual pixel-scale results across each lake and state. For 2019, average annual lake-scale frequencies also had a maximum value of 100%, and Oregon and Ohio had the highest average annual state-scale frequencies at 65% and 52%. Pixel-scale frequency results can assist in identifying portions of a lake that are more prone to cyanobacterial blooms, while lake- and state-scale frequency results can assist in the prioritization of sampling resources and mitigation efforts. Satellite imagery is limited by the presence of snow and ice, as imagery collected in these conditions are quality flagged and discarded. Thus, annual bloom frequencies within nine climate regions were investigated to determine whether missing data biased results in climate regions more prone to snow and ice, given that their annual summaries would be weighted toward the summer months when cyanobacterial blooms tend to occur. Results were unbiased by the time period selected in most climate regions, but a large bias was observed for the Northwest Rockies and Plains climate region. Moderate biases were observed for the Ohio Valley and the Southeast climate regions. Finally, a clustering analysis was used to identify areas of high and low cyanobacterial frequency across CONUS based on average annual lake-scale cyanobacterial frequencies for 2019. Several clusters were identified that transcended state, watershed, and eco-regional boundaries. Combined with additional data, results from the clustering analysis may offer insight regarding large-scale drivers of cyanobacterial blooms.

J	Heller, J; Sivan, N				Heller, J; Sivan, N			Melanopsis from the Pleistocene site of 'Ubeidiya, Jordan Valley: direct evidence of early hybridization (Gastropoda: Cerithioidea)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												'Ubeidiya is a 1.4 Myr-old Lower-Pleistocene site in the Jordan Valley. Its rich Melanopsis fauna was found to include five species: buccinoidea, costata, turriformis, phanesiana obediensis and multiformis. These species and their conchiometrics are described. M. buccinoidea and costata occur in the Levant also today whereas turriformis, p. obediensis and multiformis are extinct. These findings suggest considerable faunal connections between the Jordan, the Orontes and perhaps also Rodhos during the lower Pleistocene. During the late Miocene, when the Mediterranean Sea level dropped, coastal-plain freshwater habitats could have expanded and Melanopsis species could then have invaded the Rift Valley via coastal rivers. In addition they could have reached later, via the Rift Valley. Species frequencies of Melanopsis throughout 'Ubeidiya suggest three' Melanopsis landscapes': an early period dominated by buccinoidea, a later one by costata and an upper one by p. obediensis. It is reasonable to speculate that the buccinoidea landscape represents a spring or perhaps a deep lake with a nearby stream; the costata landscape a shallow, nonturbulent, well-aerated lake with a slow current; and the p. obediensis landscape a turbulent, well-aerated lake. Intermediates were found between buccinoidea and costata. Their low frequency and their chrono-distribution suggest they are hybrids, rather than evolutionary transitions between species. The 1.4 Myr old fossils of 'Ubeidiya may be the earliest direct evidence of hybridization among molluscs in nature, that is still going on today in the same region and aquatic system, among the same species. The Melanopsis hybrid populations may perhaps act as filters that prevent the introgression of most genes, but allow others to disperse into the range of the parent species.

Among such situations, high altitude of more than 3000 m produces a set of pathological disorders that includes both cerebral (cAS) and respiratory (RAS) altitude symptoms. High altitude exposure further induces anxiety responses and behavioural disturbances. The authors report an investigation on anxiety responses, personality traits, and altitude symptoms (AS) in climbers participating in a 31-day period of confinement and gradual decompression in a hypobaric chamber equivalent to a climb from sea-level to Mount Everest (8848 m altitude). Personality traits, state-trait anxiety, and AS were assessed, using the Cattell 16 Personality Factor questionnaire (16PF) the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Lake Louise concensus questionnaire. Results show significant group effect for state-anxiety and AS; state-anxiety and AS increased as altitude increased. They also show that state-type anxiety shows a similar time-course to cAS, but not RAS. Alternatively, our results demonstrate a significant negative correlation between Factor M of the 16PF questionnaire, which is a personality trait that ranges from praxernia to autia. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between personality traits and AS. This suggests that AS could not be predicted using personality traits and further support that personality traits, such as praxernia (happening sensitivity), could play a major role in the occurrence of state-type anxiety responses in extreme environments. In addition, the general processes of coping and adaptation in individuals participating in extreme environmental experiments are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

The role of herbivorous water birds in aquatic systems through interactions with aquatic macrophytes, with special reference to the Bewick's Swan - Fennel Pondweed system	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					(T)he role of aquatic macrophytes in stimulating biodiversity and maintaining clear waters is currently undisputed. The management of (eutrophic) shallow waters is therefore often directed at (re-)establishing macrophyte domination. In contrast, the role of water birds has long been considered of minor importance for the functioning of fresh water ecosystems. Indeed, in terms of biomass and production, water birds constitute only a minor part of these systems. However, water birds may graze heavily on water plants under certain circumstances, and the question arises whether herbivorous water birds have an important indirect effect on shallow fresh water systems. Mainly illustrated with the interaction between Bewick's Swans and Fennel Pondweed, we present data on the role that water plants may play in the life of water birds and how water birds may impact water plants' fitness in terms of survival, production, dispersal and competitive ability. It appears that water plants may be crucial for water birds during periods of high-energy requirements, such as migration. Despite the plants' costs associated with water bird grazing, the interaction between water birds and water plants varies in nature from an apparent predator-prey relationship to a mutually beneficial interaction depending on the context and the perspective. For the case of the Bewick's Swan-Fennel Pondweed interaction, regular bird grazing is sustainable and may actually favour the plant's dispersal. Thus, Bewick's Swans themselves may in fact play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the Fennel Pondweed rich staging sites between the swans' wintering and breeding grounds, which are vital for the swans' successful migration.					; Klaassen, Marcel/B-4325-2008; Nolet, Bart/C-1416-2008	Nolet, Bart/0000-0002-7437-4879; Klaassen, Marcel/0000-0003-3907-9599; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	584						205	213		10.1007/s10750-007-0598-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0598-5													WOS:000246583500020
J	Timmons, TJ; Hughbanks, TA				Timmons, TJ; Hughbanks, TA			Exploitation and mortality of paddlefish in the lower Tennessee and Cumberland rivers	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We estimated commercial and sport fishing exploitation of the paddlefish Polyodon spathula population in the lower Cumberland and Tennessee rivers from 1991 to 1994 using tag and reward methods. Exploitation for fish tagged over 3 years was 20.0% in Lake Barkley, 25.4% in the Kentucky Dam tailwater, and 14.4% in Kentucky Lake, most of which was commercial in Kentucky Lake (88%) and sport in Lake Barkley (65%). Although commercial harvest is prohibited in the Kentucky Dam tailwaters, some paddlefish moved to areas where commercial fishing is allowed. Most paddlefish were harvested in the lake where they were tagged, but nine individuals moved among the major tributaries of the Mississippi River. We compared the Kentucky Lake commercial paddlefish harvest during the winter spawning run of 1991-1992 with that of 1485-1986. The 1985-1986 harvest followed high roe prices and earlier intense fishing pressure, resulting in high annual mortality (69%) and a relatively lower mean length (691 mm) and weight (5.7 kg). Annual mortality was lower (22%) in 1991-1992 with reduced fishing pressure. We estimated instantaneous mortality for 9-15-year-old fish (Z = 0.25) by analysis of a catch curve and separated fishing (F = 0.157) and natural mortality (M = 0.093). Even with total exploitation of 14.4%, the status of the paddlefish population in Kentucky Lake improved by 1992. There were more older paddlefish than observed 6 years before, the mean length (857 mm) and weight (11.5 kg) increased, and there were more gravid females. Commercial catch per unit effort increased from 3.7 kg/net night in 1985-1986 to 38.3 kg/net-night in 1991-1992.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2000	129	5					1171	1180		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1171:EAMOPI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1171:EAMOPI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000165422300009
J	Slugocki, L; Czerniawski, R				Slugocki, Lukasz; Czerniawski, Robert			Water Quality of the Odra (Oder) River before and during the Ecological Disaster in 2022: A Warning to Water Management	SUSTAINABILITY												Aquatic ecosystems are under pressure due to human activity. In the summer of 2022, the Odra River (Central Europe) suffered a massive death of fish and mollusks. This paper aims to show selected water quality parameters before and during the ecological disaster and find which parameters may have been crucial to the development of this disaster. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's correlation to check the water parameters' spatial and temporal diversification. In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling was performed. The water quality parameters of the Odra system were analyzed in sections: middle Odra, lower Odra, transitional waters, and Szczecin Lagoon. Human activity has led to the formation of a system with unusual characteristics, disturbing the river's natural continuum and related processes. The year 2022 in the middle Odra differed from the previous years in having a high water temperature (>24 degrees C), high ammonium concentrations (>4 mg/L), and relatively low nitrate concentrations (<6.5 mg/L). At the same time, salt pollution in the river was very high (maximum 1.4 g/L). In June and July 2022, we observed low chlorophyll a concentrations in the middle Odra (on average 2.3 mu g/L and 4.4 mu g/L, respectively), presumably due to salinity stress and high temperatures, suppressing freshwater phytoplankton taxa. This circumstance has created the appropriate conditions for developing euryhaline and thermophilic Prymnesium parvum. Because of decaying organisms, hypoxia occurred in the lower Odra (0.26 mg/L of dissolved oxygen in surface waters), and oxygen conditions worsened in the transitional waters (<4 mg/L). The zonal deaths of fish and mollusks result from multiple stressors induced by human activity. This disaster has proven that it is necessary to improve selected water quality parameters to reduce the risk of such disasters. The most urgent recommendations are to reduce the salt pollution of the upper section of the Odra, reduce nutrient inputs, and improve the condition of smaller rivers feeding the main course of the Odra.					; Sługocki, Łukasz/GXM-8978-2022	Slugocki, Lukasz/0000-0003-0064-006X; czerniawski, robert/0000-0001-7785-087X														2071-1050				MAY 25	2023	15	11							8594	10.3390/su15118594	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118594													WOS:001005351000001

Paleohydro-climatic changes revealed by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility at the Heitugou section, Nihewan Basin, and its influences on human's occupation	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												Paleohydro-climatic changes in the habitats of early humans are closely related to their evolution and occupation of specific niches. In the Nihewan Basin of North China, a large number of archaeological sites dating back to the early Pleistocene have been discovered which record the occupation history of human ancestors in the region. However, thus far, studies of the history of paleohydro-climatic changes in the Nihewan Basin and their influences on human occupation remain insufficient. Here, we report the results of a systematic investigation of variations in the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy in the Heitugou (HTG) section to partially rectify this paucity of data and interpretations. The HTG section is located in the eastern Nihewan Basin where, in 2006, a Paleolithic site was discovered and excavated at the bottom of the sequence. By comparing detailed magnetic susceptibility sequences in the HTG section with those of the nearby Xiaochangliang and Dachangliang sections, we found that the sedimentation of the HTG section began about 1.9 Ma, indicating that the HTG archaeological site possibly records the earliest human occupation of middle-to-high latitude North China. Our studies of the AMS in the HTG section indicate that it is characterized by a primary sedimentary magnetic fabric without significant disturbance, demonstrating its potential for tracing regional paleo-hydrological changes. In most samples dating between 1.9 Ma and 0.4 Ma, the maximum susceptibility axes (K-max) cluster along the SE-NW vector, suggesting hydrodynamic changes tracable in the study area were mainly influenced by the Huliu River. In addition, a relatively weak K-max direction biased towards the SW-NE axis was also observed, possibly generated by the predominant flow of the Sanggan River. These two rivers - the Huliu and Sanggan - determined the paleohydrological changes in the eastern Nihewan paleolake basin. Meanwhile, AMS studies also suggest multiple-phase hydrodynamic changes in the Nihewan Basin. Around 1.9 Ma, a thick layer of gravel was deposited in the study area due to the emergence of the Huliu River, or tectonic subsidence of the Nihewan Basin. Strengthened hydrodynamic changes and higher water-levels of the Nihewan paleolake may have driven early human ancestors to occupy higher topographic locations. Between 1.9-1.8 Ma, the paleolake expanded and the hydrodynamic regime weakened accordingly, which may correspond with the enhancement of the summer monsoon cycle in East Asia. Between 1.8-1.5 Ma, the sedimentary hydrodynamic regime strengthened noticeably early on, and subsequently weakened continuously. During the period from 1.5-1.3 Ma, as the East Asian summer monsoon regime intensified, warmer and wetter climatic conditions resulted in deepening of the Nihewan paleolake, which may have subsequently weakened influences from fluvial input and was associated with decreased sedimentary hydrodynamics. Between 1.3-0.9 Ma, high-frequency fluctuations in the AMS are noted, indicating a dramatic change in lacustrine hydrodynamics possibly attributable to the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) event. After 0.9 Ma, the Nihewan paleolake deepened again. Relatively high-amplitude fluctuations during this period reflect a cyclicity of 100 ka, possibly indicating that it was controlled by global ice volume. In concordance with other Paleolithic sites in the Nihewan Basin that have been chronometrically investigated, our studies at Heitugou reveal that paleohydro-climatic changes had a significant influence on early hominin activities in the Nihewan Basin, which shaped the spatio-temporal distribution of Paleolithic sites there. For example, during the early Pleistocene, early humans lived mostly on lower lake terraces in the eastern Nihewan Basin, when the lake level was still quite low. Subsequently, they moved to topographically higher sites due to gradually increasing lake levels. During the Middle and Late Pleistocene, when the Nihewan paleolake shrank, early humans moved toward the upper reaches of the Sanggan River, and were widely distributed along river courses across the Nihewan Basin during the Late Pleistocene in order to maintain home ranges near permanent water sources.

It is a famous concentrated distribution area of high-quality mineral water in China, which has a great economic value. Antu County is one of the main distribution areas of basalt and mineral water in Changbai Mountain. The distribution of mineral water has a strong hydraulic relationship with surface water, which constitutes abundant recharge reserves. It is important to study the hydrochemical characteristics and the relationship between surface water and mineral water to provide a theoretical basis for further discussion on the formation process and rational utilization of mineral water resources in Changbai Mountain. A total of 18 water samples in the period of abundant and dry water were collected, including rainwater, mineral water, and surface water. Geostatistics was utilized to analyze the hydrochemical characteristics. Hydrochemical component tracing and stable environmental isotope technology with end-number calculation reveals the transformation relationship between mineral and surface water. The results indicate that: (1) The hydrochemical type is mainly HCO3-Ca-Na and HCO3-Ca-Mg type. The average content of H2SiO3 is 50.78 mg/L, which reach the standard of high quality metasilicate mineral water. (2) The mineral water formation process is dominated by the water-rock interaction in silicate mineral weathering. Metasilicate came from hydrolytic reaction of silicate and aluminosilicate under acidic conditions. (3) Atmospheric precipitation is the main recharge source, and the recharge area locates in the south nature reserve of the study area. The average retention time of mineral water is 35.5 years, and the recharge ratio of mineral water to surface water is up to 83.7%. This study will provide a theory guide for the protection and rational utilization of groundwater resources in study area and a reference for mineral spring formation study in basalt mountain area.					; Sun, Wenhao/HTM-8375-2023; Ma, Yuxi/GWD-0501-2022; Li, Jialin/B-3046-2018	Sun, Wenhao/0000-0001-7375-3669; Li, Yihan/0000-0001-9736-0456; 														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	18							2770	10.3390/w14182770	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182770													WOS:000856900900001

For this purpose we examined how the changes in the pigment composition of surface sediments follow their changes in the water column. Depth-integrated lake water and surface sediment samples were collected weekly in May-October 2007. Considering cyanobacterial and diatom dominance in phytoplankton, we analysed fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin as marker pigments for diatoms, zeaxanthin as a marker pigment for total cyanobacteria and canthaxanthin as a marker pigment for colonial cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll a and its derivative pheophytin a were applied as indicators for total phytoplankton. The dynamics of phytoplankton pigments in surface sediments generally did not follow their dynamics in the water column, possibly due to intensive resuspension and a high sedimentation rate in a large and shallow lake. It was noticed that the surface sediment carries information on pigment degradation intensity and on weight and size characteristics of phytoplankton cells, which affect their sinking and floating velocities. Higher pigment contents of sediment in spring were presumably caused by lower resuspension due to high water level and slower degradation in cold water. Pheophytin a and the marker pigments of cyanobacteria were found to be persistent against degradation in upper sediment layers, which makes them useful indicators for tracking the historical changes in phytoplankton communities also in a shallow lake. Sharp decrease in chemically unstable pigment contents between the sediment surface and deeper layers indicates that only the uppermost sediment surface is resuspended in Lake Vortsjarv. The transformation of the diatom marker carotenoid diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin was found to occur mainly in sediments and not in the water column, and the process is not induced by excess light.

Whole mussel tissues were analyzed for metals (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn), and sediment samples were subjected to weak acid extraction and to a sequential extraction procedure, and analyzed for Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. Total mean Cu and Ag concentrations were statistically greater in Unio species than in Anodonta species, but other metal levels did not significantly differ between mussel species. There was a ten fold variation for Cd and Pb and five fold variation for Zn, Ag and Co concentrations in mussels among lakes. Mean concentrations of As, Cu, Se and Zn in mussel tissues varied two fold among lakes. Zn, Co and Cd concentrations in mussels were significantly negatively correlated with distance gradients from the origin of the Delta and with distance from main channels of the Danube. Other metal concentrations in mussels did not correlate with either distance gradient. Trace metal levels in mussel tissues were correlated with those in weak acid and in sequential extractions of sediment. Zn concentrations in the carbonate fraction was the best predictor of Zn concentrations in mussels. Cu and Ni levels in the organic matter and sulfide fraction were the best estimators of Cu and Ni concentrations in mussels.					; Postolache, Carmen/A-4057-2010	Lajtha, Kate/0000-0002-6430-4818; Postolache, Carmen/0000-0002-1646-9765													0018-8158						1999	392	2					143	158		10.1023/A:1003555130831	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003555130831													WOS:000081035300006

New Constraints on Deformation, Slip Rate, and Timing of the Most Recent Earthquake on the West Tahoe-Dollar Point Fault, Lake Tahoe Basin, California	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												High-resolution seismic compressed high intensity Radar pulse (CHIRP) data and piston cores acquired in Fallen Leaf Lake (FLL) and Lake Tahoe provide new paleoseismic constraints on the West Tahoe-Dollar Point fault (WTDPF), the western-most normal fault in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. Paleoearthquake records along three sections of the WTDPF are investigated to determine the magnitude and recency of coseismic slip. CHIRP profiles image vertically offset and folded strata along the southern and central sections that record deformation associated with the most recent event (MRE) on the WTDPF. Three faults are imaged beneath FLL, and the maximum vertical offset observed across the primary trace of the WTDPF is similar to 3.7 m. Coregistered piston cores in FLL recovered sediment and organic material above and below the MRE horizon. Radiocarbon dating of organic material constrained the age of the MRE to be between 3.6 and 4.9 k.y. B.P., with a preferred age of 4.1-4.5 k.y. B. P. In Lake Tahoe near Rubicon Point, approximately 2.0 m of vertical offset is observed across the WTDPF. Based on nearby core data, the timing of this offset occurred between similar to 3-10 k.y. B.P., which is consistent with the MRE age in FLL. Offset of Tiogaaged glacial deposits provides a long-term record of vertical deformation on the WTDPF since similar to 13-14 k.y. B.P., yielding a slip rate of 0.4-0.8 m/yr. In summary, the slip rate and earthquake potential along the WTDPF is comparable to the nearby Genoa fault, making it the most active and potentially hazardous fault in the Lake Tahoe Basin.

Characteristics of an Iowa Put-and-Take Rainbow Trout Fishery and Associated Economic Benefits	URBAN AND COMMUNITY FISHERIES PROGRAMMS: DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATION	American Fisheries Society Symposium				137th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	SEP 02-06, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Amer Fisheries Soc				A put-and-take winter rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss fishery was established at Banner Lake South in southern Iowa during 2004. The objectives of the new program were to promote angling and to increase trout permit sales. A total of 16,329 catchable rainbow trout were stocked between October and March in 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. During 2005-2006 each stocking was individually marked with a distinctive fin clip and a creel survey was conducted to determine angler attitudes, demographics, harvest, how quickly stockings were depleted, and whether the program paid for itself. Additionally, permit sales in an eight county area surrounding Banner Lake South were monitored through the Electronic Licensing System for Iowa (ELSI). Nearly 7,200 angler-hours were expended to harvest 83% of the fish within each two week period post-stocking, leading to approximately 90% of each stocking being harvested. Overall catch rate during 2005-2006 was 1.41 rainbow trout per hour. The majority of the anglers were Caucasian males between the ages of 16 and 64. The creel survey revealed that 56% purchased a trout permit specifically to fish Banner Lake South; these were considered new permit buyers. However, the ELSI system found that 32% of sales were to new buyers. Disparities may be due to bias from angler interviews or sales outside of the eight county area. Additionally, the creel survey indicated that 15% purchased a fishing license specifically to fish Banner Lake South. The ELSI system was unreliable in identifying new fishing license buyers. For every dollar spent on the trout program at Banner Lake South during the first three years of the program, an average of $1.68 was generated as profit from trout permit sales in the surrounding eight county area.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-04-2				2008	67						391	+																WOS:000261329900035

In addition to severe environmental degradation or boat-related disturbances, boat wave's kinetic energy can induce a cumulative impact on freshwater ecosystems. However, seldom data report the impacts of boat waves on shoreline erosion and physico-chemical properties on freshwater lakes. In this study, we monitored shoreline erosion, turbidity, and total phosphorus levels. Wave-induced shoreline erosion was measured through shoreline rebar pin excavation across five lakes in southern Quebec. Sediment resuspension was measured through turbidity sampling in Lake Massawippi over three years. Total phosphorus was also monitored for potential impacts of sediment resuspension. Our study did not detect significant shoreline erosion. However, water turbidity was positively correlated with boat traffic and wind speed and negatively with the littoral slope angle. Moreover, water total phosphorus levels were positively correlated with turbidity. Thus, despite a lack of detectible impact on the shoreline, our results suggest that boat waves can have an impact on freshwater lakes with an increase in sediment resuspension and phosphorus availability. Management agencies could therefore benefit in the long-term from implementing or reinforcing policies aiming to minimize the impact of boats on sediment resuspension.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				JUL 2	2024	49	3					355	367		10.1080/07011784.2023.2299872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2023.2299872		JAN 2024											WOS:001182622500001

Phase 1 of the surge began on the eastern sector in July, 1993 and ended in July, 1994 after a powerful outburst of subglacial meltwater into Tsivat Lake basin on the north side of Weeping Feat Island. Within days, jokulhlaup discharge built a 1.5 km(2) delta of ice blocks (25-30 m) buried in outwash, By late October 1994, discharge temporarily shifted to a vent on Weeping Feat island, where a second smaller outburst dissected the island and built two new sandar, During phase 2, which began in spring 1995 and ended within five months, continuous discharge issued from several vents along the ice front on Weeping Feat Island before returning to the Tsivat Basin. Surge-related changes include a five- to six-fold increase in meltwater turbidity; the redirection of supercooled water in two ice contact lakes; and an increase in the rate of glaciolacustrine sedimentation. U.S. Geological Survey aerial photos by Austin Post show Large ice blocks in braided channels indicating excessive subglacial discharge in a similar position adjacent to Weeping Feat Island during the 1966-1967 surge. During the subsequent three decades of retreat, the location of ice-marginal, subglacial discharge vents remained aligned on a linear trend that describes the position of a persistent subglacial conduit system, The presence of a major conduit system, possibly stabilized by subglacial bedrock topography; is suggested by (1) high-level subglacial meltwater venting along the northern side of Weeping Feat Island during the 1966-1967 surge, (2) persistent low-level discharge between surges, and (3) the recurrence of localizing meltwater outbursts associated with both phases of the 1993-1995 surge.																			0016-7606					JUL	1998	110	7					877	887		10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<0877:TBCSPT>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<0877:TBCSPT>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000074795100003

Fluvial incision and coarse gravel redistribution across the modern Dead Sea shelf as a result of base-level fall	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Global eustatic lowstands can expose vast areas of continental shelves, and occasionally the shelf edge and the continental slope. The degree of fluvial connectivity to receding shores influences the redistribution of sediments across these emerging landscapes. Shelf and slope emergence in the Dead Sea since the middle of the 20th century, offers a rare opportunity to examine evolution of stream connectivity in response to continuous base-level decline. We characterize the connectivity evolution of two streams, using high-resolution time series of aerial imagery and elevation models, field mapping, and grain-size analyses. Our rich spatiotemporal dataset of evolving channel geomorphology, sediment transport conditions, and sediment redistribution, allows calculating potential coarse sediment mobility in response to base level decline. Following shelf emergence, alluvial fans first prograded onto the low-gradient shelf under unfavourable conditions for transporting coarse sediment to the regressing shoreline. Then, with shelf and slope emergence, the two adjacent streams evolved differently. The smaller, more arid watershed still maintains its highstand delta progradation on the shelf and is practically disconnected from the receding lake. The larger catchment, heading in wetter environments and having a narrower shelf, has incised the shelf and renewed and gradually intensified the sediment transport from the highstand to the lowstand delta. Sediment mobilization to lowstand shorelines is controlled by the evolution of the channel profile and by the average speed of gravel transport (10s-100s m yr(-1)). These findings from the Dead Sea are relevant to fluvial processes operating on continental shelves during glacial maxima. Streams would have commonly stored high proportions of their coarse sediment on the continental shelves rather than efficiently connecting with the lowstand level. Additionally, differences in sediment routing patterns should exist among nearby streams, primarily due to continental margin geometry and watershed hydrology.

This article presents a multi-proxy (palaeobotanical, zoological and geochemical) study considering variable aspects of the Eemian-Early Weichselian lake-mire succession in central Poland. The investigated sequence, collected from a former small kettle-hole, revealed many ecosystem alterations, i.e. warm stages led to the terrestrialisation of the lake, whereas stadial coolings to its reappearance. Hence, we examined whether: (i) the Eemian warming influenced the ecological succession of the lake, (ii) lakes which reappeared during the Herning and Rederstall stadial coolings developed alike and (iii) the beginning of peatland functioning (interglacial or interstadial) had an impact on further plant succession. The results show that thermal amelioration during the Eemian interglacial supported domination of Tetraedron minimum and Pediastrum boryanum var. boryanum, which contributed to the sedimentation of bituminous shales. The expansion of Salvinia natans in the final stage of lake existence (Middle Eemian) was probably a result of the mild climate characterised by the lack of late spring frosts. Algae, in contrast to Cladocera, revealed bipartition of the Herning and Rederstall stadials (older sections were colder, younger warmer). However, geochemical and isotopic data point to the very low productivity of the lakes during those stadials. The lake that existed during the Henning stadial revealed very low taxonomical diversity of Cladocera, whereas that during the Rederstall was characterised by relatively high diversity of this group. During the Late Eemian and Brorup interstadial, rich fens with some oligotrophic patches with Sphagnum sp. developed. This study revealed that small water bodies, due to their very local character and often uniqueness of palaeo-records, may be a very valuable source of information about climate and palaeoecology of different groups of organisms during the Eemian interglacial and the Weichselian glaciation.

Ikizcetepeler Dam Lake inhabits some fish species as Cyprinus carpio, Leuciscus cephalus, and Barbus species. The dam lake has major economic importance to the area for both fisheries and drinking water. The reason to select C. gibelio was due to the dominant species in stagnant and slow running waters and possible harmful interactions with native species. Materials and methods: A total of 480 specimens of C. gibelio were monthly collected by gill nets during a 1-year period from Ikizcetepeler Dam Lake. Age was determined from scales. Length-weight relationships, von Bertalanffy equation were used to estimated for growth. Sex were determined by macroscopic observation of gonads. Spawning period of this species was determined according to gonado-somatic index (%). Results: Females and males reached a maximum age groups of VI. Total length was 23.6-31.3 cm in females and 23.0-31.4 cm in males. The male and female ratio was 1:3.52 (M:F) in the favor of females. The Von Bertalanffy growth equations (in length) were found as L-t = 34.89.(1-e(-0.11(t+760))), L-t = 32.09(1-e(-0.23(t+5.83))) for females and males, respectively. The estimated b values were given as 2.886 and 2.981 for females and males, respectively (b<3). The condition of the fish increased during early summer. Spawning period of this species occured between April and July. Conclusions: With a comparison of the relevant literature, the studied Prussian carp population was characterized by a shorter life span and more rapid growth during the first years of life. These can be considered as typical features of invasive species.																			0031-5362					SEP	2014	116	3					285	291																WOS:000352520900007
J	Skubinna, JP; Coon, TG; Batterson, TR				Skubinna, JP; Coon, TG; Batterson, TR			Increased abundance and depth of submersed macrophytes in response to decreased turbidity in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Submersed macrophyte communities and turbidity near shore were measured from 1991 to 1993 to determine if more light resulting from colonization of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) into Saginaw Bay in 1990 corresponded with changes in macrophyte distribution. Turbidity was sampled along five transects distributed at intervals perpendicular to the perimeter of inner Saginaw, Bay to monitor changes in light available to plants in Saginaw Bay. Vegetation was sampled in July along these transects to determine the distribution and composition of the macrophyte communities each summer. We also measured the maximum depth of colonization and the area of plant coverage by use of 31 transects evenly distributed around Saginaw Bay in August. Turbidity decreased (P less than or equal to 0.097) at transects in northern littoral regions from 1991 to 1993 over submersed plant communities and uncolonized sediments, but not in southern littoral regions. The relative abundance of submersed macrophytes increased (P less than or equal to 0.0001) at all transects from 1991 to 1993, especially at transects where turbidity decreased significantly. Maximum depth of colonization (2.0 m) and the area of macrophyte coverage (101.3 km(2)) increased in Saginaw Bay, especially in the northwestern littoral region of the bay. Macrophytic chlorophytes, charophytes, and Vallisneria americana increased (P less than or equal to 0.003) in relative abundance most at transects where turbidity decreased significantly. These results demonstrate that even in a large well-mixed lacustrine environment, zebra mussels have the capacity to reduce turbidity sufficiently to allow submersed macrophytes to expand their distribution and abundance.																			0380-1330						1995	21	4					476	488		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71060-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71060-7													WOS:A1995TP51700007

Tephrostratigraphic analyses of three volcanic ash layers ascribe the investigated succession to the MIS 12-MIS 11 period, spanning the interval ca. 500-410 ka. Litho-pedo facies assemblage indicates predominant lacustrine deposition, interrupted by a minor sub-aerial and lake low stand episode. Variations in major and minor elements concentrations are related to changes in the clastic input to the lake. The oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate (delta O-18(c)) intervals is interpreted mainly as a proxy for the amount of precipitation in the high altitude catchment of the karst recharge system. The record shows pronounced hydrological variability at orbital and millennial time-scales, which appears closely related to the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation pattern and replicates North Atlantic and west Mediterranean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations. The MIS 12 glacial inception is marked by an abrupt reduction of precipitation, lowering of the lake level and enhanced catchment erosion. A well-defined and isotopically prominent interstadial with increased precipitation maybe related to insolation maxima-precession minima at ca. 465 ka. This interstadial ends abruptly at ca. 457 ka and it is followed by a phase of strong short-term instability. Drastic lake-level lowering and enhanced clastic flux characterized the MIS 12 glacial maximum. Lacustrine deposition restarted about 440 ka ago. The MIS 12 MIS 11 transition is characterized by a rapid increase in the precipitation, lake-level rise and reduction in the clastic input, interrupted by a short and abrupt return to drier conditions. Comparison with marine records from the Iberian margin and western Mediterranean suggests that major events of ice rafted debris deposition, related to southward migrations of the polar front, match the harshest periods in central Italy. This indicates strong teleconnections between Northern hemisphere ice sheet dynamics, North Atlantic oceanic conditions and Mediterranean continental hydrology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The young Rancho Seco and Mazcuta volcanoes are of particular interest because their distal lava flows host the pre-Hispanic archaeological urban centres of Angamuco and Cortijo Viejo, respectively. The Rancho Seco scoria cone was radiocarbon-dated at 27,845 + 4451-425 yr BP and emitted at least six andesitic lava flows which were emplaced toward the SW (Lake Patzcuaro) covering an area of 21.3 km(2) with a volume of similar to 0.64 km(3). The Mazcuta scoria cone dated at 7970 +/- 135 yr BP produced five basaltic andesite-andesite lava flows toward the NW (Lake Zacapu), where they cover an area of 28.85 km(2) with a volume of similar to 0.57 km(3). The recently studied archaeological site of Angamuco became an important urban centre during the rise of the Tarascan Empire in the Post-Classic period (AD 900-1521), while the Cortijo Viejo site remains largely unexplored, but its occupation might fall within the same period. Although the young lava flows on which these sites are built seem inhospitable and barren with a rugged topography and rocky substrate unfit for agriculture, early inhabitants adapted and modified its surface according to their needs.

In the Pitinga region, it consists of acidic to intermediate ignimbrites with cogenetic surge and ash-fall deposits associated to hypabissal and effusive acidic rocks. In the Balbina Lake area it consists of acidic to intermediate effusive rocks, crystal-rich ignimbrites and pumice-rich ignimbrites. Detailed petrographic studies of phenocrysts and crystal fragments provided characterization and distinctive features of pyroclastic, effusive and hypabissal rocks. The phenocrysts of hypabissal rocks were affected by high temperature resorption and flow-related physical fragmentation, the effusive rocks can have a considerable content of crystal fragments due to intense dissolution and fragmentation of the phenocrysts and the pyroclastic rocks crystal fragments are generated mainly by decompression mechanic fragmentation. Dissolution and resorption of quartz and feldspar crystals may have acted at pressure conditions between 500 MPa and 100 MPa, in response to rapid decompression in the magma ascent. The viscosity values of 7,5-10 log eta (Pa s) for anhydrous conditions decrease exponentially with estimated water addition. The amount of phenocrysts and their intratelluric character in the volcanic units of Iricoume Group can be related to a magma chamber with high content of crystals. We suggest that even with the addition of water in the magma, the viscosities had a drastic increase with progressive crystal growth due to the viscosity dependence on the solid fraction and the deposits were generated by the extrusion of viscous lava and pyroclastic flows.

SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY OF DINOSAUR LAKE: SMALL SCALE FLUVIO-DELTAIC STRATAL RELATIONSHIPS OF A DINOSAUR ACCUMULATION AT THE AARON SCOTT QUARRY, MORRISON FORMATION, SAN RAFAEL SWELL, UTAH	PALAIOS												Stratal geometries, cyclical stacking patterns, and tap honomic analysis of the Aaron Scott Quarry in the Jurassic Morrison Formation indicate that sediments accumulated within a prograding fluvio-deltaic lacustrine system. Sediments were deposited during the progressive fill of a large lake. Stratal geometries and stacking patterns display relationships similar to larger-scale deltaic sequences caused by fluctuations in base level. Stratigraphic, paleontologic, and sedimentologic analysis indicates that water-volume-driven, base-level changes were responsible for the accumulation and preservation of the assemblage. The assemblage accumulated during a lowering of base level during the late stages of an overall fall caused by drought and was buried by a rapid rise at the end of the drought. Fluvio-deltaic lake fill consists of numerous off-lapping beds of sparsely bioturbated, coarsening-upward mudstone capped by thin, bioturbated silty mudstones. Erosional surfaces dip to the west and cut older mudstone parasequences. Retrogradation, aggradation, and progradation of strata typify stratigraphic trends above the erosion surface. Coarse braided stream sands cap off successive sequences as accommodation is filled prior to the next lowstand and sequence boundary incisement. The quarry is a large, taxonomically diverse deposit formed by the concentration of animals at the margins of a lake during a drought. Animals congregated near the banks as smaller watering holes dried. Bone locations and orientations indicate reworking by fluvial and wave currents. Vertical preservational trends indicate accumulation over a period of years. Trace fossil, lake invertebrate distributions, and sedimentological evidence indicate that periodic establishment of oxygen stratification within lake waters may have contributed to conditions favorable for bone preservation.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				MAY-JUN	2011	26	5-6					275	283		10.2110/palo.2010.p10-104r	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2010.p10-104r													WOS:000292342800004

Most existing N & P reduction strategies were designed by reducing N & P use or ecological restoration with high costs. To introduce low-cost strategies for N & P reduction, this study proposed enhancing N & P retention by altering water flow pathways within the artificial watersheds (polders) via hydraulic regulation in the western region of Lake Taihu Basin, China. Soil and Water Assessment Tool, Phosphorus and Nitrogen Dynamic Model for Lowland Polders, and Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System were coupled together to quantify N & P flow and retention under diverse flow pathways. Our results revealed that streams and creeks have a larger total nitrogen and phosphorus (TN & TP) retention capacity compared to rivers. Polder hydraulic regulation reduced TN & TP into lakes by >8%, with larger retention capacities for Lakes Changdang and Gehu (15.1% and 11.2%, respectively) than those for Lake Taihu (3.3% and 2.5%). Notably, N & P retention correlated positively with polder density but negatively with polder-river distance particularly during summer rainfall events. The case study demonstrated a low-cost strategy for N & P retention via polder hydraulic regulation, offering a transferable solution to other lowland regions with artificial drainage.

J	Xu, XW; Zhao, Q				Xu, Xinwen; Zhao, Qing			Magnetic Component Unmixing of a Lacustrine Sedimentary Drill Core from Heqing Basin	ATMOSPHERE												Long and continuous lacustrine sediments in Southwest China provide exceptional records of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) evolution. Rock magnetic and environmental magnetic methods have significant roles in these lacustrine studies. However, lacustrine sedimentary environments are complex and magnetic mineral signatures can be altered by post-depositional processes. This study applies isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) component unmixing methods to lacustrine sediments from the Heqing core, to identify and quantify magnetic mineral components. We analyzed 104 samples based on lithological variations and magnetic susceptibility (chi) to examine the composition of magnetic minerals and their relative contributions. Three distinct magnetic components were identified in IRM component unmixing results: a low-coercivity detrital component, a medium-coercivity authigenic component, and a hard magnetic component. Based on rock magnetic results, the medium-coercivity component was attributed to greigite. These components exhibit stratigraphic trends that reflect changes in paleoenvironmental conditions. The medium-coercivity component shows an upwards decrease, indicating a significant change in ISM science at about 1.8 Ma. The study highlights the importance of considering post-depositional processes when interpreting magnetic mineral signatures in lacustrine sediments. The CLG model, combined with conventional rock magnetic analyses, provides a rapid approach for characterizing magnetic assemblages in weakly magnetic sediments.					xu, xinwen/OEN-8727-2025															2073-4433				AUG 30	2025	16	9							1031	10.3390/atmos16091031	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16091031													WOS:001579375400001

Eleven of these have been introduced or translocated, and 7 of the remaining 12 are endemic to the Prespa lakes. This high proportion of endemism requires confirmation because the systematic position of several of the species and subspecies remains uncertain. The absence of a predatory fish in Mikri Prespa, the occurrence of trout in Megali Prespa, the presence of eels in both lakes and the occurrence of many rheophilous fish species typifies the fish communities of these two lakes. Monitoring of the fish population in Mikri Prespa, from 1984 to 1994, showed apparent stability or a slight increase in catches during this period. Not all the introduced species have been able to establish populations and their impact on the indigenous populations is yet to be defined. A spectacular re-establishment of the carp population, following the crash of the stock of this species in the 1970s-1980s, was recorded in the spring of 1991. The past and present situation of the fisheries in lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa is described, and their productivity and yields are analysed. Particular attention is given to a traditional fishing method unique to the Prespa region: ''pelaizia'' fishing. The factors involved in the temporal trends in the fisheries are identified and analysed. Recommendations for the management of the fish populations and the fisheries are proposed, so that the sustainability of this resource and the survival of the endemic fish species can be ensured.																			0018-8158					AUG 22	1997	351						107	125		10.1023/A:1003064509018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003064509018													WOS:A1997YG80000009

We deduced: 1. The phytoplankton is relatively poor in species which is attributable to high salinity and turbidity. Blue-green algae of picoalgal size, meroplanktonic diatoms, green algae either with gelee or elongated form are the most important groups in the plankton; 2. No consequent horizontal differences in the distribution of phytoplankton biomass were found; the high contribution of diatoms (69%) and green algae (22%) is characteristic; 3. Despite the low percentage contribution (0.54%) of phytoplankton dry weight in total seston, the two variables correlate closely because of simultaneous resuspension after wind actions. The prevalence of both low phytoplankton/seston ratio and significant correlation between these two variables is indicative to the presence of a meroplankton; 4. Phytoplankton biomass, especially that of diatoms, varies within wide limits in the short term as a combined effect of growth/loss, transport by horizontal water currents and periodic resuspension from the sediment surface. Diatoms like Fragilaria, Surirella and Campylodiscus are involved especially. Parameters of population dynamics (growth rate, annual cycles, length of stationary phases, standing crop) were estimated based on moving averages. Growth rates were smaller than those of 'normal' planktonic species; however, the similarities of seasonal pattern suggest that the carrying capacity of the lake is very constant; 5. Picoalgal biomass is very high in the lake; its contribution to total biomass can exceed 75%, especially in spring. The large cellular chlorophyll a content of Neusiedlersee's phytoplankton can most probably be explained by this high picoalgal standing crop, which is not included in the routine biomass estimations; 6. Concerning long-term changes of phytoplankton, periodic appearances and disappearances are very characteristic. Annual average biomass of most species is growing for several (3-5) years, then declining with a similar rate and these periods are recurrent. Climatic drying-out periods, during which water level lowers, conductivity increases, nutrients and their ratios change following trend-like periodicities, and they are supposed to be responsible for the observed longterm periodicity of dominant species. An increased nutrient load in the seventies was superimposed on this cyclicity; 7. Must of the species can be found in smaller or larger amounts in the littoral microhabitats (canals, inner ponds) of the lake in periods when they are absent or very rare in the open water. Thus, these littoral microhabitats play a very important role in the survival and recruitment of planktonic populations to the open water.

This study presents a well-dated high-resolution diatom analysis from a 1.66-m-long sediment core taken from Lake Cuogeda (CGD) on the southeast (SE) edge of the Tibetan Plateau to document environmental changes over the past similar to 4000 years. Diatom and other geochemical proxies show that, from 3850 to 3430 cal yr BP (before present, 0 BP=1950 AD, 1900 to 1480 BC), the environment of Lake CGD is acidic, oligotrophic, and enriched with humic acids. And the lake ice cover duration is short during this period. During 3430-1550 cal yr BP (1480 BC-400 AD), Lake CGD has less humic acid and a relatively high pH environment. The ice cover duration is longer, and the temperature drops during this period. Our multi-indicator recorded two environment fluctuations at similar to 2800 cal yr BP (850 BC) and 2210-1950 cal yr BP (260 BC-0 AD). From 1550 to 3.6 cal yr BP (400-1946 AD), the lake ecosystem changed to a higher pH condition and had a prolonged freezing time. From 3.6 cal yr BP (1946 AD) to the present, Lake CGD's water was acidic, with an environment of shorter duration of ice cover and stronger lake water turbulence. Comparisons between the CGD records and other climate reconstructions underscore the relevance of the CGD record for regional and global environments. Comparisons indicate that the environment evolution pattern of SW China during the Late Holocene was greatly affected by solar radiation and North Atlantic sea surface temperature.

In this paper, we investigate how catchments impact the taxonomic and functional composition of phytoplankton communities in high mountain lakes, and how this impact varies according to the atmospheric nutrient deposition regime. For two years, we sampled the post snow-melt and the late summer phytoplankton, with a set of biotic and abiotic parameters, in six French alpine lakes with differing catchments (size and vegetation cover) and contrasting nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition regimes. Whatever the nutrient deposition regime, we found that the lakes with the smallest rocky catchments showed the lowest functional richness of phytoplankton communities. The lakes with larger vegetated catchments were characterized by the coexistence of phytoplankton taxa with more diverse strategies in the acquisition and utilization of nutrient resources. The nutrient deposition regime appeared to interact with catchment characteristics in determining which functional groups ultimately developed in lakes. Photoautotroph taxa dominated the phytoplankton assemblages under high NP deposition regime while mixotroph taxa were even more favored in lakes with large vegetated catchments under low NP deposition regime. Phytoplankton functional changes were likely related to the leaching of terrestrial organic matter from catchments evidenced by analyses of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios in seston and zooplankton. Plankton delta N-15 values indicated greater water-soil interaction in lakes with larger vegetated catchments, while delta C-13 values indicated the effective mineralization of the organic matter in lakes. The role played by catchments should be considered when seeking to determine the vulnerability of high altitude lakes to future changes, as catchments' own properties will vary under changes related to climate and airborne contaminants.

The thickness of each layer was measured in the field and dating was performed using C-14 and U data. The lake was previously supplied by river water, groundwater, and hot springs enriched in sodium, sulfur, and boron. Control factors on the rhythmite were climate oscillations and compositional differences of water. The adsorption of boron by clay minerals could be attributed to the alternation between clay and borax layers. Low temperature, high pH, and high evaporation exerted significant influences on the precipitation of original borax and mirabilite. In the evaporative lake, the precipitation of mirabilite (a mineral indicative of a cold-dry environment) was dominant and produced the asymmetric couplets. The lake water was poor in chloride and rich in sodium sulfate, and an abrupt change was observed at 11.4 cal. kyr BP. According to the laminated sediment and the thickness of the minerals, the climate was dry-cold with four sub-warm phases before 11.4 kyr BP (after 20.6-11.4 kyr BP), and wet-warm with four sub-cold pulses after 11.4 kyr BP (11.4-5.2 kyr BP). The two thickest mirabilite layers suggested extremely hard conditions after 20.6 kyr BP, and before 11.4 kyr BP, respectively.

J	Ammann, B				Ammann, B			Biotic responses to rapid climatic changes: Introduction to a multidisciplinary study of the Younger Dryas and minor oscillations on an altitudinal transect in the Swiss Alps	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Qualitative and quantitative changes in fossil flora and fauna have been used in many studies to infer climatic change. Here we ask a different question: how do flora and fauna respond to climatic changes such as rapid warming or cooling? As an independent proxy for paleotemperature we take the ratio of oxygen isotopes in biogenically precipitated lake marl and in ostracod shells. This introductory paper describes the project design and the five sites on an altitudinal transect from 600 m to about 2300 m asl in the western Swiss Alps. As cases of climatic cooling and warming we use the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas as major changes, and the Gerzensee and Preboreal oscillations as minor changes. At the two sites of Gerzensee and Leysin these changes are recorded in stable-isotope ratios, and there the time scales can be derived by correlations to the GRIP ice core (Schwander, 2000; von Grafenstein. 2000). Biotic responses to climate changes are treated in individual papers using pollen (Wick, 2000), plant macrofossils (Tobolski and Ammann, 2000), and remains of chironomids (Brooks, 2000), beetles and other insects (Lemdahl, 2000), and chydorid Cladocera (Hofmann, 2000). They are followed by a synthesis focusing on quantification of biotic responses (Ammann et al., 2000). In addition, a reconstruction of summer temperatures for the Allerod and the Younger Dryas at Gerzensee is provided by Letter et al. (2000). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The present research synthesizes a range of multi-proxy data, including satellite thermal infrared remote sensing, water piezometric level, hydrochemical analyses, and isotopic signatures (H-2, O-18 and Rn-222), to elucidate the interaction dynamics and patterns between surface water and groundwater within a representative hyper-arid closed basin on Tibetan Plateau. The findings indicate that the water in the basin originates primarily from the glacier/snow melt water and precipitation in the mountainous regions, and would experience multiple but spatially heterogeneous interactions between river and aquifers from the mountain pass to the tail salt lakes after entering the basin. Water interaction in the piedmont alluvial plain is dominated by the pattern of river seepage into aquifers with a water flux of 25.82 m(3)/s, which drives the development of hierarchical groundwater flow systems in the basin. The interaction pattern converts to groundwater discharge of the local groundwater flow system at the front of alluvial fan plain, which forms the principal spring-fed rivers and the predominant overflow zone in the basin with the groundwater discharge flux of 3.22 m(3)/s. Most of these discharged groundwaters would infiltrate back into the aquifers in the middle-upper part of the loess plain with the river water leakage flux of 2.89 m(3)/s. River water and phreatic groundwater present a gradual enrichment of hydrochemcial components and water stable isotopes (H-2 and O-18) along the flow path due to the intense evaporation in the loess plain. The multiple water interactions between surface water and groundwater lead to the anomalous distribution of fresh water in the middle-lower stream area, which is related to the intermediate groundwater flow system and the local variable groundwater flow system. Water interaction in the lowest salt-marsh plain is in the pattern of regional groundwater flow system discharge into the tail salt lakes under natural condition, but evolves to only discharge into the artificial brine extraction canals rather than the tail salt lakes after decades of brine exploitation. Our findings provide a conceptual and preliminarily quantificational understanding of the interaction regimes between surface water and groundwater in large arid closed basins at the watershed scale.

Here, we quantitatively reconstructed the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) since 12.7 cal ka BP in Chibuzhang Co using a novel terrestrial paleothermometer (the ring indices of OH-GDGTs, RI-OH). The reconstruction closely matched the record of submerged plant biomass as indicated by fatty acids, which, in Chibuzhang Co, is controlled by lake water temperature. We found that the Holocene MAAT in Chibuzhang Co was dominated by the local mean annual insolation, and influenced, to varying degrees and across different timescales, by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, westerly jet (WJ), and radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. Importantly, a cold and volatile period was observed at 5-3 cal ka BP. This period has also been widely recorded across mid-latitude regions of East Asia, suggesting that the cooling pattern was regional. This regional cooling may have been due to the combined effect of reduced local insolation and a southward shift of the WJ. Our findings thus support a region-specific interpretation of the "Holocene temperature conundrum". Since regional atmospheric circulations patterns such as WJ can have an important impact on temperature evolution, regional specificity should be taken into account in global temperature integration.					; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022	Kou, Qiangqiang/0000-0003-0987-4620; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUN 15	2024	334								108740	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108740		MAY 2024											WOS:001247964400001
J	Sondergaard, M; Danielsen, M				Sondergaard, M; Danielsen, M			Active bacteria (CTC+) in temperate lakes: temporal and cross-system variations	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The temporal variation in the abundance and proportion of highly respiration-active bacteria in the eutrophic lakes Esrum and Frederiksborg Slotsso was determined with the redox dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC). In addition, a comparative late summer study was undertaken across a gradient of nutrient enrichment in Danish lakes. The purpose was to investigate the importance of substrate (chlorophyll) and temperature for the control of CTC-active cells (CTC+). The abundance of CTC+ cells was much lower and more variable than the total number of cells counted after 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The proportion of CTC+ cells in Lake Esrum and Frederiksborg Slotsso was normally <5%, and between 2.5 and 20% in 14 other lakes. The abundance as well as the proportion of CTC+ cells increased with chlorophyll in Lake Esrum and Frederiksborg Slotsso, and chlorophyll explained 43% of the variability in CTC+ abundance. In the comparative study, the abundance of CTC+ cells increased along the chlorophyll gradient, which explained 49% of the variability. The results showed that the abundance and, to a lesser degree, the proportion of CTC+ bacteria were controlled by substrate supply. One consequence of the low abundance of active bacteria is that in situ growth rates scaled to CTC+ cells are 3- to 7-fold higher than those scaled to DAPI counts. It is suggested that studies on factors controlling bacterioplankton activity at the single-cell level should be investigated scaled to active cells.																			0142-7873					NOV	2001	23	11					1195	1206		10.1093/plankt/23.11.1195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.11.1195													WOS:000171946200002

Between ca. 15.6-15.2 cal ka BP, a lowstand was synchronous with Heinrich Event 1 and an intense drought across Eastern Africa. At ca. 15.2-15.2 cal ka BP a lake began to develop at the core site in response to wetter conditions, at the onset of the African Humid Period (AHP). However, in contrast to other lakes in eastern Africa, Hayk lake level fell around ca. 14.8 cal ka BP, indicating a climate shift towards aridity. The lake began filling again at ca. 12.3 cal ka BP and reached maximum water depth between ca. 12.0-10.0 cal ka BP. Lake level declined slowly during the Holocene, culminating in the termination of the AHP at Hayk between ca. 5.2-4.6 cal ka BP. In the late Holocene, ca. 2.2-1.3 cal ka BP, Lake Hayk was again deep and fresh with some evidence of short-term lake level variability. The palaeo-record from Lake Hayk indicates that while it experienced, to a broad degree, the same glacial-interglacial dynamics and sub-millennial shifts in climate found in other palaeolimnological records from eastern Africa, there are offsets in timing and rate of response. These differences reflect chronological discrepancies between records, as well as the varying climate sensitivities and site-specific factors of individual lake basins. This record highlights the different responses by lakes in a climatically vulnerable area of Ethiopia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

PA2001	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Samples of filtered particulate organic matter (POM) were obtained during the summers of 1999 and 2000 from the surface waters of the Nordic seas to monitor the spatial distribution of long-chain alkenones. The aim of the study was to appraise existing alkenone-based climatic proxies in northern high latitudes. Unusually high percentages of the tetraunsaturated alkenone were measured in the polar waters of the East Greenland Current, with C-37:4 of up to 77% in 80% of sea-ice cover. Values of percent C-37:4 across the Nordic seas showed a strong association with water mass type. Analysis of coccoliths in filters indicated that calcified Emiliania huxleyi could not be discounted as the biological precursor of alkenones in all the water masses. A combined data set of 69 samples of POM revealed a stronger correlation of percent C-37:4 to sea surface salinity ( SSS; R-2 = 0.72) than to sea surface temperature (SST; R-2 = 0.50). Values of percent C-37:4 in sea surface POM were much higher than those in surficial sediments of the northern North Atlantic. To explain the discrepancy in sedimentary and surface water column percent C-37:4, we propose that the alkenone contents in surface sediments underlying arctic and polar waters are a combination of autochthonous and allochthonous inputs of alkenones. Our results show that percent C-37:4 can be used to reconstruct the relative extension of arctic/polar water masses in the North Atlantic. However, the results prevent confirmation of percent C-37:4 as a paleo-SSS proxy in the Nordic seas, given its multivariate nature in our data set and the decoupling between its range of values in surface waters and sediments.					; Rosell-Melé, Antoni/B-3433-2013; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/B-3433-2013; Ziveri, Patrizia/I-3856-2015	Bendle, James/0000-0002-6826-8658; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/0000-0002-5513-2647; Ziveri, Patrizia/0000-0002-5576-0301													0883-8305	1944-9186				APR 6	2005	20	2							PA2001	10.1029/2004PA001025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004PA001025													WOS:000228381900001

Distributions of organic matter and macroelements were determined in the tree- and field-layer vegetation, the forest floor and the mineral soil of the study site, Annual tree growth was largely offset by mortality, resulting in a relatively stable standing stock of ca. 245 t ha-1. Annual aboveground litter production averaged 3.7 t ha-1 yr-1, chiefly in the form of deciduous leaf fall. The average pH of the precipitation (4.3) was reduced considerably by contact with the forest canopy. Throughfall was enriched with other elements, principally K and, to a lesser extent, Ca and Mg. The cationic composition of the forest-floor percolates, on the other hand, was dominated primarily by Ca and only to a lesser extent by Mg and K. The stand receives moderate acid deposition, mainly from average inputs of 33-36 kg ha-1 yr-1 of SO42- and 24-29 kg ha-1 yr-1 of NO3- distributed throughout the year. Atmospheric inputs add to substantial natural NO3- production, notably within the forest floor and upper mineral soil, and contribute to leaching of bases, principally Ca and Mg, from the rooting zone. Active recycling of elements together with weathering of primary minerals should assist in preserving the base status of the site.																			0049-6979					FEB	1992	61	3-4					243	252		10.1007/BF00482608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00482608													WOS:A1992HC63400005

Density gradients of cladocerans and copepods were generated in an enclosure experiment to compare the impact on the plankton of a filter feeder (Daphnia hyalina x galeata) with that of more selective feeders (calanoid and cyclopoid copepods). The experiment was conducted in situ over 25 days during spring in a mesotrophic lake, Schohsee, Germany. 2. The plankton community was monitored regularly. Daphniids were able to graze on the phytoplankton present, which mainly consisted of small (<1000 mum(3)) species, whereas copepods did not show any impact on algae. 3. At the end of the experiment, Daphnia and remaining cyclopoid copepods were harvested and sorted manually, prior to analyses for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Daphniids from mesocosms stocked purely with differing densities of Daphnia showed little variability in stable isotope values, whereas those that thrived in enclosure bags together with copepods exhibited lower delta(13)C values. 4. The change in Daphniadelta(13)C indicates a change of food sources, modified by the presence of the copepods: the higher the mean abundance of copepods in the enclosures, the more C-13-depleted the daphniids. Increasing abundance of high nucleic acid (HNA) bacteria in the copepod bags may account for the trend in Daphniadelta(13)C via increased grazing on the bacteria themselves, or via grazing on phytoplankton utilising isotopically light CO2 from respiratory release. 5. Cyclopoid copepod stable isotope signatures were related to Daphnia and copepod abundances in copepod bags, suggesting that cyclopoids preyed on the available zooplankton.

The catastrophic dieback of Typha domingensis in a drained and restored East Mediterranean wetland: re-examining proposed models	MIRES AND PEAT												We experimentally tested two geochemical models which have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to the catastrophic dieback of Typha domingensis in constructed Lake Agmon within the drained Hula peatland, northern Israel. An elaborate lysimeter station simulating the conditions imposed by sulphide toxicity and P deficiency models was used to test them experimentally. Rhizosphere pH and redox potential were monitored in situ in real time throughout the summers of 2007 and 2008. A comparative study of redox-reduction simulation was coupled with periodic sampling and analysis of sulphide and other reducing species. N and P were determined in the plant tissues to compute the N:P nutrient limitation index and evaluate nutrient deficiencies. The sulphide toxicity model was not accepted as a viable mechanism because Typha domingensis stands did not show any signs of stress, even when growing in rhizosphere with a sulphide concentration three times that during the actual dieback in 1996. The P limitation model was not supported by the N:P index, which indicated N (<14) rather than P (>16) limitation. Since Typha has now returned and is thriving in Lake Agmon and adjacent drainage canals, we suggest a self-thinning mechanism followed by normal succession of macrophytes in this relatively young constructed wetland as the most logical mechanism to explain the observed dieback.

FRESHWATER CRAYFISH 11: A JOURNAL OF ASTACOLOGY					11th Symposium of the International-Association-of-Astacology	AUG 11-16, 1996	LAKEHEAD UNIV, THUNDER BAY, CANADA	Int Assoc Astacol	LAKEHEAD UNIV			Field surveys and laboratory studies suggest that orconectid crayfish are more sensitive than cambarids to degraded water quality associated with lake acidification. Consequently, we predict that time trends in the relative abundances of orconectid crayfish will correlate with recent changes in acidification-related water quality to a greater degree than the abundances of cambarid crayfish. Ongoing efforts to monitor the recovery of small lakes in south-central Ontario that were once moderately impacted by acid rain provide 7 years of time-trend data to test this prediction. Crayfish relative abundances were estimated from mid-summer catches using baited traps. Water-quality data were collected from the same 13 lakes each year. Temporal coherence between time trends in crayfish relative abundances and water chemistry was assessed using the intraclass correlation. In contrast to our predictions, cambarid relative abundances exhibited more non-zero temporal coherence values than orconectid relative abundances. This finding suggests that short-term trends in orconectid relative abundances are not better indicators of water-quality trends than cambarid abundances. Consequently, the relative abundances of both cambarids and orconectids should be monitored to assess the biological effects of changes in acid-rain related water-chemistry parameters.

Response of subfossil Cladocera in Gerzensee (Swiss Plateau) to early Late Glacial environmental change	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sub-fossil Cladocera were studied in a core from Gerzensee (Swiss Plateau) for the late-glacial periods of Oldest Diyas, Bolling, and Allerod. Cladocera assemblages were dominated by cold-tolerant littoral taxa Chydorus sphaericus, Acroperus harpae, Alonella nana, Alona affinis, and Alonella excisa. The rapid warming at the beginning of the Bolling (GI-1e) ca. 14,650 yr before present (BP: before AD 1950) was indicated by an abrupt 2 parts per thousand shift in carbonate delta O-18 and a clear change in pollen assemblages. Cladocera assemblages, in contrast, changed more gradually. C sphaericus and A. harpae are the most cold-tolerant, and their abundance was highest in the earliest part of the record. Only 150-200 years after the beginning of the Bolling warming we observed an increase in less cold-tolerant A. excisa and A. affinis. The establishment of Alona guttata, A. guttata var. taberculata, and Pleuroxus unicatus was delayed by ca. 350, 770, and 800 years respectively after the onset of the Bolling. The development of the Cladocera assemblages suggests increasing water temperatures during the Bolling/Allerod, which agrees with the interpretation by von Grafenstein et al. (2013-this issue) that decreasing delta O-18 values in carbonates in this period reflect increasing summer water temperatures at the sediment-water interface. Other processes also affected the Cladocera community, including the development and diversification of aquatic vegetation favourable for Cladocera. The record is clearly dominated by Chydoridae, as expected for a littoral core. Yet, the planktonic Eubosmina-group occurred throughout the core, with the exception of a period at ca. 13,760-13,420 yr BP. Lake levels reconstructed for this period are relatively low, indicating that the littoral location might have become too shallow for Eubosmina in that period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A total biomass of 156 tonnes corresponding to 160 kg ha(-1) of fish, predominantly cyprinids, were removed. A decline in the unit catches of fishing was observed. The removed fish biomass versus phosphorus concentration of the lake was considered sufficient to reduce the impact of cyprinids on water quality. The phosphorus removed within fish biomass corresponded to 38 mu g l(-1) and 21% of the external phosphorus load of the fishing period. The mean total phosphorus concentration dropped from > 50 to a parts per thousand currency sign36 mu g l(-1). However, the densities of planktivorous young-of-the-year percids remained high and the role of zooplankton grazing in improving water quality was found non-significant or transient. The cladocerans biomass decreased and the small-sized Daphnia cucullata remained almost the only daphnid in Lake lemiste during and after the manipulation. Predomination of filamentous cyanobacteria was replaced by a more diverse phytoplankton composition and co-domination of micro- and pico-sized colonial cyanobacteria during summer. Mean phytoplankton biomass decreased from 15 to 6 mg l(-1) primarily as a result of decreased in-lake TP availability. The Secchi disc transparency increased only in May 2005-2007. The effects of coincidental events, a decline of external loading of phosphorus and a simultaneous flushing induced by heavy rainfall, on lake water quality are discussed with some implications to the future management of the reservoir.

We collected data on water quality and the frequency of occurrence of water-milfoil species within selected watermilfoil beds to compare the waterbodies and determine if they were related to the distribution of E. lecontei. We found E. lecontei in 14 waterbodies, most of which were in eastern Washington. Only one lake with weevils was located in western Washington. Weevils were associated with both Eurasian (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and northern watermilfoil (M. sibiricum K). Waterbodies with E. lecontei had significantly higher (P < 0.05) pH (8.7 +/- 0.2) (mean +/- 2SE), specific conductance (0.3 +/- 0.08 mS cm(-1)) and total alkalinity (132.4 +/- 30.8 mg CaCO3 L-1). We also found that weevil presence was related to surface water temperature and waterbody location (chi (2)(2) = 24.3, P less than or equal to 0.001) and of all the models tested, this model provided the best fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi (8)(2) = 4.0, P = 0.9). Our results suggest that in Washington in waterbodies with pH greater than or equal to8.2 and specific conductance greater than or equal to0.2 mS cm(-1). Furthermore, weevil distribution appears to be correlated with waterbody location (eastern versus western Washington) and surface water temperature.

Although IUCN considers it to be 'Least Concern,' the Common Monitor Lizard faces several threats throughout its global distribution range, and the status of the species is decreasing rapidly. The Dhaleswari River of Assam (India) is one of the most important abodes of this species, where it is locally known by the names 'Irong' and 'Shanda.' Geographically, the Dhaleswari River is located in southern Assam (India), which falls within the Indo-Burma Biodiversity hotspot area. Unfortunately, most of the wildlife of southern Assam (India) are poorly studied, and this varanid is one of the most ignored species of the region. The present study was conducted along the Dhaleswari River, Assam, India, to elucidate the distribution, status, ecology, threats, and conservation of the Common Water Monitor, and is the first report on this species from this river. The results show that the Dhaleswari River still serves as a habitat of the species, with a viable population. Further, the species was found to prefer smaller rivers with clayed soil and bushes, and it faces major threats from habitat destruction, hunting for flesh and oil, and conflicts with humans. Based on our observations, we discuss recommendations for the conservation of this large varanid.

J	Holcová, K				Holcova, Katarina			Thecamoebians from the upper vltava river (Sumava mountains, Czech Republic):: Species composition of assemblages vs. environment in streams	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Between 1999 and 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were analyzed in one hundred samples collected from tributaries of the Upper Vltava River (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic, Middle Europe). The Sumava Mountains comprise the largest forest complex in Central Europe that is still preserved in a near natural condition. Diverse fresh-water environments (springs, wetlands, peat bogs, creeks, rivers and ponds) characterize the area. Thecamoebian tests were picked from dried 36-500 pin residues. In total, eighteen thecamoebian species were identified. The number of species per sample varies from one to thirteen, and the assemblages are characterized by dominance of Centropyxis orbicularis, C. aculeata, Pontigulasia compressa, Difflugia oblonga and Centropyxis arcula. A negative correlation (r = - 0.67) is notable between abundances of centropyxids and P. compressa. The negative correlation is caused by the different environmental conditions preferred by each taxon. Assemblages dominated by centropyxids originate mainly from standing water, whereas assemblages with common to abundant occurrences of P. compressa prefer running-water environments and substratum without coarse organic debris. Following a flood event in August 2002, thecamoebian assemblages were more diverse and abundant. While reworking of thecamoebian tests from different biotopes during flooding probably caused the increase in diversity, a boom in the population of Centropyxis orbicularis after the flood event confirmed the opportunistic character of this species. Boundary abundances of diagnostic species defined for flowing and standing waters in the forest area (= more than 20% of Pontigulasia compressa for flowing water and more than 50% of centropyxids for standing water) can be applied in interpretation of ancient environments. Similarly, changes in thecamoebian assemblages before and after the flood event can be used in paleoecology.

J	MARCHANT, AD				MARCHANT, AD			APPARENT INTROGRESSION OF MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA ACROSS A NARROW HYBRID ZONE IN THE CALEDIA-CAPTIVA SPECIES-COMPLEX	HEREDITY												Within the Caledia captiva grasshopper species-complex, the "Torresian" and "Moreton" tax show extensive karyotypic and genic differences. They are parapatric, and form a narrow hybrid zone which has been shown to be stable and to be maintained by hybrid breakdown largely attributable to the chromosomal differences. The Moreton, "South East Australian" (SEA) and "Lake''s Entrance" (LE) taxa, however, have similar genic characteristics and represent segments of a gradual continuous cline in the frequencies of chromosome morphs. A study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in these taxa, using fragment-length patterns generated by four restriction enzymes, has shown that Moreton, SEA and LE form one polythetic taxon, and that insects from certain sites within the Torresian range fall into a separate taxon. There is an area, however, within the range of the chromosomally and allozymically defined Torresian taxon in which the mtDNA is found to be exclusively of the Moreton/SEA/LE type. This area of apparent introgression extends much further into the range of the Torresian taxon than any reported introgression of either chromosome or allozyme markers from the Moreton taxon. It is suggested that the hybrid zone (as defined by nuclear characters) has migrated southwards, somehow leaving Moreton-type mtDNA behind. If this is the case, then the absence of Moreton nuclear genes in these insects, whose mtDNA shows that they are descended from Torresian/Moreton hybrids gives additional support to the concept of a "co-adapted genome" as a characteristic of a biological species.																			0018-067X	1365-2540				FEB	1988	60		1				39	46		10.1038/hdy.1988.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hdy.1988.7													WOS:A1988M137700007

The amount of leaf litter, numbers of ascospores produced, and severity of greasy spot on trap plants were monitored throughout 1997 and 1998 in Immokalee (southwest Florida) and Lake Alfred (central Florida). Leaf litter and ascospore production were greatest from March to July in both locations, with little litter and few ascospores thereafter. Ascospore production occurred earlier in Immokalee than in Lake Alfred in both years. Disease on trap plants was moderate to severe throughout the year except from November to February. Large numbers of ascospores produced early in the year when conditions were less favorable resulted in the same disease severity levels as low numbers of ascospores produced later in the year when environmental conditions were favorable. Greater greasy spot severity in southwest Florida, compared with central Florida, is more likely due to higher rainfall and warmer winter temperatures than to differences in time of infection. Single annual copper fungicide applications were made each month from April to August in 1998 and 1999 in LaBelle (southwest Florida), Ft. Pierce least coast), and Lake Alfred to determine the most effective time of application. Two two-spray treatments, May + July and June + August, were also evaluated in 1999. A single copper fungicide application in June provided the most consistently effective control across all locations. The June + August two-spray treatment was very effective in disease control, but usually no better than a well-timed single application.																			0191-2917					DEC	2000	84	12					1294	1298		10.1094/PDIS.2000.84.12.1294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2000.84.12.1294								30831870					WOS:000165419200007
S	Aksoy, H		Harmancioglu, NB; Altinbilek, D		Aksoy, Hafzullah			Surface Water	WATER RESOURCES OF TURKEY	World Water Resources											Turkey is a country with considerable water resources in a region where water is a strategic element due to its scarcity. With the increase in the population and demand, water scarcity has accelerated, making water a more vital element. Due to the considerably large size of the country and to the spatial and temporal uneven distribution of water resources, water demand in some regions exceeds the available water for a period of time that creates a water shortage. Surface water hydrology in Turkey is a great challenging problem as it has the greatest share (80%) in the water potential of the country. The total annual surface flow is 186.6 billion m(3), almost all born from the river basins within the territory of Turkey and harvested with the rainfall-runoff coefficient of 0.37 from the 574.0 mm annual rainfall. Surface water resources of Turkey are divided between 25 river basins; most stay within the country. There are also transboundary river basins where Turkey is either the upstream country or the downstream country. Among the river basins, the Euphrates-Tigris has the highest contribution, which is almost 1/3 of the surface water potential of Turkey. The northeastern part of Turkey receives the highest precipitation while the least amount of rainfall falls on Central Anatolia. A quite high number of hydrometric gauges have been established to record the quantity and quality of water; however, more are emerging, considering the topographical and geographical diversity in Turkey, to observe such hydrometeorological variables as streamflow, precipitation, evaporation, snow depth, etc. Due to the great spatial variability in the hydrometeorological conditions, some regions in Turkey are flood-prone while others can be affected by extreme droughts. Trend analysis has shown that extremes in the streamflow become more pronounced with larger maxima and lower minima than before. Also, lakes are important fresh water bodies for domestic use as well as irrigation, farming, industry, fisheries, etc. Water level in many lakes however decreases so that the availability of water in the lakes are under risk. Integrated water resources development strategies are needed at country-scale to balance the demand with the available water, considering also the decreasing trend in water availability and the increasing trend in the demand.					; Aksoy, Hafzullah/G-7222-2011	Aksoy, Hafzullah/0000-0001-5807-5660; 													2509-7385	2509-7393	978-3-030-11729-0; 978-3-030-11728-3				2020	2						127	158		10.1007/978-3-030-11729-0_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11729-0_5	10.1007/978-3-030-11729-0												WOS:000487756200008

Here, we identify potential threats to the provisioning of freshwater by examining local water sources in the community of Coral Harbour, Arctic Canada. While we did not identify any concerns over water quality through the analysis of samples collected in 2021-2022, we did find that the current reservoir for the community is insufficient to continue provisioning water over a typical 20-year planning horizon. We also note that if anomalous climate conditions occur (e.g., extreme temperatures), the exhaustion of the annual water supply could occur faster than projected, causing a local water shortage until ice-off when replenishment is possible. Hydrometric data collected from Post River, the source used to replenish the reservoir, also highlight the response of river levels to both rainfall and dry periods, and thus qualitatively demonstrates the potential impacts of future episodic late-summer droughts on river water availability, which could affect resupply. These results highlight the need to include climate-based assessment in freshwater infrastructure assessment and planning processes in remote Arctic communities.

The Longxi area of the Gansu Province, northwestern China, is an ideal area to study such influences because of its unique geographical location within the transition zone among the EAM region, inland arid areas and the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Here, we present ostracods from a borehole in the Longxi area, as ostracods are one of the few micropalaeontological proxies available in freshwater sediments. The studied ostracods were assigned to 13 species of 10 genera and 9 indeterminate taxa and reported for the first time from the Linxia Formation in the studied area. The ostracod assemblage is composed entirely of non-marine taxa, including species of Ilyocypris, Cypris, Cyprinotus, Heterocypris, Eucypris, Potamocypris, Zonocypris, Candona, Pseudocandona and Leucocythere. Ostracod biostratigraphy indicates that the Linxia Formation should be Pliocene in age. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the studied ostracod assemblages suggests that there was a permanent freshwater lake with some temporary ponds in the studied area of the Loess Plateau during the Pliocene, which shows the influences of the East Asian Summer Monsoon during the Pliocene.

J	Losiak, A; Czechowski, L; Velbel, MA				Losiak, Anna; Czechowski, Leszek; Velbel, Michael A.			Ephemeral liquid water at the surface of the martian North Polar Residual Cap: Results of numerical modelling	ICARUS												Gypsum, a mineral that requires water to form, is common on the surface of Mars. Most of it originated before 3.5 Gyr when the Red Planet was more humid than now. However, occurrences of gypsum dune deposits around the North Polar Residual Cap (NPRC) seem to be surprisingly young: late Amazonian in age. This shows that liquid water was present on Mars even at times when surface conditions were as cold and dry as the present-day. A recently proposed mechanism for gypsum formation involves weathering of dust within ice (e.g., Niles, P.B., Michalski, J. [2009]. Nat. Geosci. 2, 215-220.). However, none of the previous studies have determined if this process is possible under current martian conditions. Here, we use numerical modelling of heat transfer to show that during the warmest days of the summer, solar irradiation may be sufficient to melt pure water ice located below a layer of dark dust particles (albedo <= 0.13) lying on the steepest sections of the equator-facing slopes of the spiral troughs within martian NPRC. During the times of high irradiance at the north pole (every 51 ka; caused by variation of orbital and rotational parameters of Mars e.g., Laskar, J. et al. [2002]. Nature 419, 375-377.) this process could have taken place over larger parts of the spiral troughs. The existence of small amounts of liquid water close to the surface, even under current martian conditions, fulfils one of the main requirements necessary to explain the formation of the extensive gypsum deposits around the NPRC. It also changes our understanding of the degree of current geological activity on Mars and has important implications for estimating the astrobiological potential of Mars. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Spectrum of the lakes: using satellite remote sensing to unveil water color in Minnesota's Sentinel Lakes for water quality monitoring	INLAND WATERS												Traditional water quality monitoring methods often face limitations of equipment costs and labor demands, requiring innovative approaches to effectively assess the ecological health of inland lakes across vast areas. This research explores the application of free, publicly available water color chromaticity analysis for midcontinent lakes in Minnesota, USA. We examined water color variations in Minnesota's Sentinel Lakes using Landsat 8 OLI data to analyze surface reflectance samples collected from the deepest area within each lake during the late summer, corresponding to peak annual insolation and trophic activity. The median dominant visible wavelength was used to characterize water color. Results indicate a prevalence of green-yellow hues (similar to 575 nm), indicating the presence of photosynthetic activity and suspended solids. Regional variations were also observed across Minnesota. Red colors were common in the northeast and south, while blues were scarce. Statistical analysis revealed color was not unique to any ecoregions; however, sentinel lakes within an ecoregion were proven to have the same color. In the Canadian Shield ecoregion, annual water color variations were attributed to forested catchments and undisturbed hydrology. Using the median dominant visible wavelength (mDVW) to observe decadal patterns of water color can serve as a baseline for identifying anomalies and guide resourceful investigations.

J	JONES, ML; KOONCE, JF; OGORMAN, R				JONES, ML; KOONCE, JF; OGORMAN, R			SUSTAINABILITY OF HATCHERY-DEPENDENT SALMONINE FISHERIES IN LAKE-ONTARIO - THE CONFLICT BETWEEN PREDATOR DEMAND AND PREY SUPPLY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The offshore fish community of Lake Ontario is presently dominated by intensively managed, nonnative species: alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax at the planktivore level and stocked salmonines at the piscivore level. Salmonine stocking rates per unit area of Lake Ontario are the highest in the Great Lakes, and fishery managers are concerned about the sustainability of the fishery under present stocking policies, particularly with the recent collapse of the Lake Michigan fishery for chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. In this paper, we describe and present the results of a simulation model that integrates predator demand estimates derived from bioenergetics, prey and predator population dynamics, and a predation model based on the multiple-species functional response. Model reconstructions of historical alewife biomass trends and salmonine diets corresponded reasonably well with existing data for the period 1978-1992. The simulations suggest that current predator demand does not exceed the threshold beyond which alewife biomass cannot be sustained, but they indicate that the sustainability of the prey fish community is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in overwinter survival of alewife; an additional mortality of 25% in a single winter would be sufficient to cause the collapse of the alewife population. The model includes a number of assumptions and simplifications with a limited empirical basis; better estimates of salmonine survival rates, an evaluation of the importance of spatial and temporal interactions among predators and prey, and incorporation of the effects of recently observed declines in system productivity at lower trophic levels would significantly increase confidence in the model's projections.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1993	122	5					1002	1018		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<1002:SOHDSF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<1002:SOHDSF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000027
J	BOYBEYI, Z; RAMAN, S				BOYBEYI, Z; RAMAN, S			A 3-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL SENSITIVITY STUDY OF CONVECTION OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												The Florida peninsula has the highest annual number of days with thunderstorms in the United States, partly due to sea breeze convergence. A three-dimensional mesoscale planetary boundary layer (PBL) model with the E-epsilon turbulence closure is used to investigate the relationship between sea breeze convergence and convection over the peninsula for two ambient wind cases during typical summer days. It is found that the spatial and temporal variation of the sea breeze convergence zones and the associated convective activities depend to a large extent on the direction and magnitude of the ambient wind. For the case of southeasterly ambient winds, a strong convergence zone and hence significant rainfall occur primarily along the west coast of the peninsula. The convergence zone and the associated rainfall shift towards the east coast for the case of southwesterly ambient winds. These are in agreement with the observations. In contrast to the southeasterly and southwesterly ambient winds, an intense convergence zone and rainfall occur near both coastlines of the peninsula under light ambient winds. It is also found that lake Okeechobee has a substantial influence on south Florida's mesoscale weather. A cloudless region is always present over the lake at least until late afternoon due to its own lake breeze circulation. Finally, increased roughness of the land surface appears to influence the temporal and spatial variation of the convection by determining the intensity of the vertical turbulent transport of heat and momentum.																			0006-8314					SEP	1992	60	4					325	359		10.1007/BF00155201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00155201													WOS:A1992JQ05000002

Postglacial Vegetation and Climate History of the Oka Plateau (East Sayan Mountains, South Siberia)	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The first results of palynological analysis of the bottom deposits of Kaskadnoe Lake and a reconstruction of vegetation and climate on the Oka Plateau over the last 14.2 ky are reported. It is shown that approximately 1.2-12.9 cal ka BP (GI-1) the regional climate was sufficiently warm and humid to allow the development of a forb-shrub tundra with spruce and larch stands. Cooling at approximately 12.9-11.5 cal ka BP (GS-1) led to the predominance of the forb-shrub tundra in the lake basin. Siberian pine settled on the Oka Plateau in a moderate-cold and humid climate at approximately 11.5-9.0 cal ka BP. The warmer and drier climate, which prevailed in the Middle Holocene approximately 9.0-4.5 cal ka BP, resulted in the retreat of dark-coniferous forests from the Kaskadnoe Lake basin. The spreading of larch and Siberian pine coincided with the onset of Neoglacial conditions in the Late Holocene. It was established that the environmental conditions on the Oka Plateau in the Late Glacial Period and Holocene were generally controlled by the interaction of the western atmospheric transport and the East Asian summer monsoon, the temperature variations caused by the insolation level, and the specific features of regional atmospheric circulation.

Using data from the world's longest-running shallow lake experimental mesocosm facility, we studied the effects of different levels of nutrient loadings combined with varying temperatures, which also included a simulated 1-month summer heat wave (HW), on nutrient and oxygen concentrations, gross ecosystem primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem production (NEP) and bacterioplankton production (BACPR). The mesocosms had two nutrient levels (high (HN) and low (LN)) combined with three different temperatures according to the IPCC 2007 warming scenarios (unheated, A2 and A2 + 50%) that were applied for 11 years prior to the present experiment. The simulated HW consisted of 5 degrees C extra temperature increases only in the A2 and A2 + 50% treatments applied from 1 July to 1 August 2014. Linear mixed effect modeling revealed a strong effect of nutrient treatment on the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), on various forms of phosphorus and nitrogen as well as on oxygen concentration and oxygen percentage (24 h means). Applying the full dataset, we also found a significant positive effect of nutrient loading on GPP, ER, NEP and BACPR, and of temperature on ER and BACPR. The HW had a significant positive effect on GPP and ER. When dividing the data into LN and HN, temperature also had a significant positive effect on Chl-a in LN and on orthophosphate in HN. Linear mixed models revealed differential effects of nutrients, Chl-a and macrophyte abundance (PVI) on the metabolism variables, with PVI being particularly important in the LN mesocosms. All metabolism variables also responded strongly to a cooling-low irradiance event in the middle of the HW, resulting in a severe drop in oxygen concentrations, not least in the HN heated mesocosms. Our results demonstrate strong effects of nutrients as well as an overall rapid response in oxygen metabolism and BACPR to changes in temperature, including HWs, making them sensitive ecosystem indicators of climate warming.

J	Schwarz, AM; Hawes, I				Schwarz, AM; Hawes, I			Effects of changing water clarity on characean biomass and species composition in a large oligotrophic lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												The biomass and species composition of characean meadows in oligotrophic Lake Coleridge, New Zealand, were monitored over a 2 year period during which water clarity underwent significant fluctuation. Water clarity, measured as vertical attenuation coefficient (K-d), varied between 0.1 and 0.4 m(-1) and there was a period of prolonged low clarity in the middle of the study. Characean meadows extended to a maximum depth of over 30 m at the start of the study in April 1993 but were reduced to less than 20 m by July 1995. At depths of 5, 10 and 15 m, where characean meadows persisted through to July 1995, there was a change in species composition, with an upward shift in the proportions of dominant taxa. This change was manifested as an increase in the percentage contribution to biomass of Chara globularis and Chara corallina at the expense of Chara fibrosa. Over the entire study period characean biomass remained maximal at depths of 5 and 10 m at approximately 180 g (dry weight) m(-2). At a depth of 5 m, biomass was not affected by changing water clarity and appeared to be limited by exposure to wave action and variable water level. At depths greater than 10 m, biomass declined significantly over the study period of 2 years. Reductions could be related to the underwater light field which plants experienced over the period between each sampling. Total characean biomass declined below maximal when irradiance fell below 1.0 mol m(-2) day(-1). Despite an increase in water clarity in early 1995, recovery of biomass was not observed within the time scale of this study.

On the basis of their immunoreactivity, these trabecular structures, found on the fibroblast layer side of the spongy layer of human term amniochorion and adjacent reticular layer, have been shown to contain type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen. The origin of these components may be from primitive epithelial structures which pumped fluid into the lakes that eventually coalesced to form the extraembryonic coelom separating the extraembryonic somatic mesoderm from the extraembryonic splanchnic mesoderm. Such a theory of their origin might link them with the mysterious 'cellular layer', a single-cell-thick layer of cells which is usually no longer present in fetal membranes at term. The similarity in composition but not in size of these structures to anchoring plaques for type VII collagen is possible support for the view that these structures are integrators of extracellular matrix polymeric proteins. The 'pseudobasement' membrane associated with the trophoblast layer, on investigation, appears to be typical by six criteria. 'Coiled' fibrous structures in the extracellular matrix of the spongy layer may aid adjustments under tension at this shear surface by a detachable 'Velcro' or 'two spring' fastening system. The coils are rich in fibronectin. The suggestion is made that the compact layer is a giant lamina reticularis associated with the amniotic epithelial basement membrane.

J	Lemay, M; Bégin, Y				Lemay, Mickael; Begin, Yves			Using ice-scars as indicators of exposure to physical lakeshore disturbances, Corvette Lake, northern Quebec, Canada	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The hypothesis tested in this study is that ice-scars recorded by lakeshore tree stands can be used as an integrative proxy indicator of the overall hydrodynamic disturbance regimes affecting northern lakeshores. A 2-km-long shore segment was divided into 21 sections according to shore orientation and slope. An ice-scar chronology and a wave exposure index value were obtained for each shore section. A significant relationship was found between ice-scar chronology and wave exposure index, which indicates that the mechanical action and physical force of ice activity mainly depend on the same environmental factors determining exposure to wave action (i.e. fetch, wind direction and velocity, and shore slope). The spatial and temporal variability of ice-scar chronology features also corresponded to the distribution of geomorphological features associated with ice activity along the shoreline. Analysis of the hydrological signal associated with these ice-scar chronology features indicated that an increase in ice-push frequency observed in the 1930s can be associated to an increase in wave action related to more frequent spring floods maintaining high lake levels during the ice-free period. This study demonstrates that ice-scars have strong potential as proxy indicators of shore exposure and provide a temporal frame to reconstruct the history of lakeshore disturbance regimes at a local scale. Together, ice-scars and wave exposure index provide essential information to interpret the evolution of lakeshore vegetation mosaics in time and space.

Irish surface water response to the 2018 drought	PLOS WATER												Intense weather events are projected to increase as a consequence of climate change. The summer 2018 drought in Europe impacted human health, ecosystems, and economic prosperity. Even locations with an abundance of fresh water, like Ireland, faced water restrictions due to depleted supplies. To characterize the effect of the 2018 drought on Irish rivers, we collected surface water samples from rivers across the island at the drought onset and termination. We analyzed samples for stable water isotopes 618O and 62H and calculated the fraction of evaporation from river groundwater and precipitation inflow (E/I) of rivers. We extended river 618O and 62H analysis to 2020 for rivers in two catchments, Corrib and Shannon, to investigate how Irish river systems respond to high precipitation events, and the role of loughs (lakes) in the system. River 618O and 62H values showed progressive depletion from west to east in response to precipitation depletion from airmasses arriving off the Atlantic Ocean. From onset to termination of the 2018 drought, river 618O and 62H values were enriched and the calculated E/I value increased for most rivers. D-excess were negatively correlated with E/I value, providing support for E/I calculations. Extended analysis of loughs along the Corrib and Shannon river systems showed that lough Corrib consistently induced isotopic enrichment, while loughs in the Shannon catchment inconsistently caused isotopic enrichment. Both systems exert control over river isotopic composition in hydrologic extremes. Findings promote additional research in hydrologic patterns in response to increasing frequency of floods and droughts.					; Carey, Anne/Q-9296-2019	Flynn, Raymond/0000-0001-5228-8876; 														2767-3219				NOV 14	2023	2	11							e0000197	10.1371/journal.pwat.0000197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pwat.0000197													WOS:001416395500001

In this study, we recon-structed the Holocene lake-level history of Taro Co lake system (Taro Co, Zabuye Salt lake and Lagkor Co) on the southwestern TP, based on seventeen optically stimulated luminescence ages of paleoshorelines. The results showed that lake-levels were at the broad highstands of-40 m above modern lake-level (amll) from 11.6 to 7.0 ka, during which the three lakes were integrated and formed a mega paleolake. After 7.0 ka, the mega paleolake fluctuantly contracted, and Lagkor Co and Zabuye Salt Lake probably became separated at-6.9 and-3.4 ka, respectively. Seven rapid millennial low lake stands were identified at 11.3-11.2 ka (14 m amll), 9.9-8.7 ka (< 28 m amll), 8.2-7.9 ka (6 m amll),-6.9 ka (5 m amll),-3.0 ka (8 m amll), 2.1-1.1 ka (< 6 m amll) and-0.4 ka (6 m amll). The large magnitude lake-level declines indicated that they reflected effective moisture in response to global millennial-scale climate events, e.g., the 11.1, 10.3, 9.4, 8.2 and 7.2 ka events in the early and middle Holocene, and the 4.2 ka and Little Ice Age events in the late Holocene. Holocene lake-level fluctuations were simultaneous with that of other lakes on the south-central TP. Comparisons with other paleoclimatic records suggested that the Holocene hydrological history of Taro Co was mainly dominated by both monsoonal pre-cipitation and glacial meltwater supply, as well as evaporation and basin topography. Differences in meltwater supply probably led to different lake-level change histories for endorheic lakes in the lake system. In the future warming and wetting, Tibetan endorheic lakes would keep expanding, hence Taro Co lake system would be formed again through hydrological connections.					yu, lupeng/AAX-5883-2021; Tu, Han/GPW-6770-2022; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024	Huang, Chang/0000-0003-4029-3584; tu, hua/0000-0002-9555-8271; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2023	220		A						106686	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106686		OCT 2022											WOS:000875620900003

Quantifying the emissions and air quality co-benefits of lower-carbon electricity production	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The impact of air emissions from electricity generation depends on the spatial distribution of power plants and electricity dispatch decisions. Thus, any realistic evaluation of the air quality impacts of lower-carbon electricity must account for the spatially heterogeneous changes in associated emissions. Here, we present an analysis of the changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with current, expected, and proposed energy efficiency and renewable energy policies in Wisconsin. We simulate the state's electricity system and its potential response to policies using the MyPower electricity-sector model, which calculates plant-by-plant reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. We find that increased efficiency and renewable generation in a 2024 policy scenario substantially reduce statewide emissions of NOx and SO2 (55% and 59% compared to 2008, 32% and 33% compared to 2024 business-as-usual, BAU). PM2.5 is quantified across the Great Lakes region using the EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for some emissions scenarios. We find that summer mean surface concentrations of sulfate and PM2.5 are less sensitive to policy changes than emissions. In the 2024 policy scenario, sulfate aerosol decreases less than 3% over most of the region relative to BAU and 3-13% relative to 2008 over most of Wisconsin. The lower response of these secondary aerosols arises from chemical and meteorological processing of electricity emissions, and mixing with other emission sources. An analysis of model performance and response to emission reduction at five sites in Wisconsin shows good model agreement with observations and a high level of spatial and temporal variability in sulfate and PM2.5 reductions. In this case study, the marginal improvements in emissions and air quality associated with carbon policies were less than the technology, renewable, and conservation assumptions under a business-as-usual scenario. However, this analysis for Wisconsin shows how integrated modeling can quantify the emission and air quality co-benefits associated with carbon reduction measures, and this approach can be applied to other regions and larger geographical scales.

J	JOHNSON, BS; ERICKSON, AE				JOHNSON, BS; ERICKSON, AE			SUGAR-BEET RESPONSE TO SUBSOILING AND WHEEL TRAFFIC	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Normal tillage practices often create poor physical conditions for crop growth on lake plain soils in Michigan. Tillage studies were conducted in 1983 on Parkhill loam (fine-loamy, mixed, nonacidic, mesic Mollic Haplaquept) and from 1983 to 1985 on Charity clay (fine, illitic (calcareous), mesic Aeric Haplaquept) to evaluate the potential for increasing sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) yield by reducing the physical limitations of these soils. Treatments consisted of eight combinations of a primary tillage and secondary tillage variable. Primary tillage was applied in the fall and consisted of subsoiling and moldboard plowing (SMP), subsoiling and shallow chiseling (SCH), moldboard plowing (MP), or shallow chiseling (CH). The secondary tillage variable consisted of the presence or absence of tractor wheel traffic occurring during seedbed preparation. Response of sugarbeet 'US-H20' and 'US-H23' was evident each year and was attributed in part to improved soil aeration where subsoiling was performed and where wheel traffic was absent. Response was greatest in 1983 when subsoiling increased root yield of US-H20 by 10.7 Mg ha-1 on Parkhill loam and by 7.6 Mg ha-1 on Charity clay. Elimination of preplant wheel traffic increased root yields by an average of 8.3 Mg ha-1 on Charity clay that year. Recoverable sucrose yield was affected in proportion to root yield each year because tillage had no effect on recoverable sucrose concentration. The need to minimize wheel traffic in sugarbeet production systems, regardless of the primary tillage practices employed, was evidenced by results of this study.

Characterization and monitoring of the excavation damaged zone in fractured gneisses of the Rose lend tunnel, French Alps	TECTONOPHYSICS												The Roselend dead-end tunnel was excavated in the last fifties by blasting in the Meraillet crystalline rock mass located on the shore of an artificial reservoir lake in the French Alps. Successive emptying and filling of the reservoir lake induce mechanical deformation of the rock mass. Thus, this tunnel is an exceptional place to study the evolution of the damaged zone (due to the excavation, and named EDZ) under a periodic mechanical or hydraulic loading. From the perspective of radioactive waste isolation in deep geological strata, the EDZ transport properties, and their evolution with time, are of major importance. The purpose of this study is, on the one hand, to quantify the transport properties of the EDZ of the Roselend tunnel through permeability measurements and drill core observations; on the other hand, to monitor the response of the EDZ to external solicitations via borehole pressure measurements. The air permeability has been deduced from pneumatic tests performed along several boreholes. The permeability profiles and the observation of drill cores lead to an estimation of the extent of the EDZ, of about 1 m around the tunnel. The response of the EDZ to barometric pumping has been observed through borehole pressure monitoring. Time-lag and attenuation of the barometric signal that propagates into the EDZ have been measured at a metric scale. The identification of potential time-lag and attenuation variations needs further investigations, the long time series of borehole pressure monitoring shows pressure increase probably due to percolating water during successive snow cover and thawing periods as observed in the Roselend area during winter.

Temporal instability of lake charr phenotypes: Synchronicity of growth rates and morphology linked to environmental variables?	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Pathways through which phenotypic variation among individuals arise can be complex. One assumption often made in relation to intraspecific diversity is that the stability or predictability of the environment will interact with expression of the underlying phenotypic variation. To address biological complexity below the species level, we investigated variability across years in morphology and annual growth increments between and within two sympatric lake charr Salvelinus namaycush ecotypes in Rush Lake, USA. A rapid phenotypic shift in body and head shape was found within a decade. The magnitude and direction of the observed phenotypic change were consistent in both ecotypes, which suggests similar pathways caused the variation over time. Over the same time period, annual growth increments declined for both lake charr ecotypes and corresponded with a consistent phenotypic shift of each ecotype. Despite ecotype-specific annual growth changes in response to winter conditions, the observed annual growth shift for both ecotypes was linked, to some degree, with variation in the environment. Particularly, a declining trend in regional cloud cover was associated with an increase of early-stage (ages 1-3) annual growth for lake charr of Rush Lake. Underlying mechanisms causing changes in growth rates and constrained morphological modulation are not fully understood. An improved knowledge of the biology hidden within the expression of phenotypic variation promises to clarify our understanding of temporal morphological diversity and instability.

S.; Ricciardi, Anthony			Ecological performance of native and invasive benthic freshwater fishes under elevated temperature	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Climate warming of freshwater ecosystems is altering the performance and trophic interactions of native and non-native species. We compared the feeding efficiency and thermal tolerance of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and a trophically analogous native fish, logperch (Percina caprodes), under current and projected mean summer surface temperatures for the nearshore lower Great Lakes (18 and 25 degrees C, respectively). Feeding efficiency at both temperatures was quantified using the functional response ratio (FRR)--the ratio of attack rate and prey handling time. Juvenile logperch had a higher FRR than juvenile gobies at 18 degrees C; however, adult gobies had a higher FRR than juvenile logperch at both 18 and 25 degrees C, indicating a greater potential for trophic impacts. At 18 degrees C, CTmaxof juvenile logperch was lower than adult gobies but did not differ from juvenile gobies, whereas at 25 degrees C, logperch CTmaxwas higher than juvenile round gobies. Following acclimation to either 18 or 25 degrees C, juvenile logperch exhibited a greater thermal acclimation capacity than the round goby. These results underscore the need for risk assessment to account for native and non-native species responses to shifting thermal contexts.

Based on a 20-year dataset of in situ observations in four deep Andean North-Patagonian lakes, we analyzed and presented a simple model to understand how the input of inorganic particles affects light penetration and influences the vertical distribution of freshwater Pcy during summer stratification. The analyzed temporal series includes two important events (volcanic eruption and glacial recession) that substantially affected lake turbidity. Thus, our mechanistic model was constructed as a function of changes in the light extinction coefficient (KdPAR) and the mean irradiance of the mixing layer (Im). Our modeling approach using Bayesian inference and a continuous nonmonotonic function successfully predicted changes in Pcy vertical distribution. The model was successful in fitting data for different minerogenic particles (volcanic ash and glacial clay) and in predicting changes under sharp increases in turbidity (volcanic eruptions), as well as in more gradual changes (glacial recession). Pcy maximum abundance increased with transparency (lower KdPAR values), and the amplitude of the vertical profile increased with higher Im values. Using our model, we achieved a full prediction of Pcy vertical distribution under different scenarios of lake transparency and lake thermal structures.

M.; Timofeev, I., V			Pollution with Heavy Metals and Metalloids and Ecological Status of Soils in Severobaikal'sk	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The content and spatial distribution of 15 heavy metals and metalloids (HMMs) in the upper soil layer (0-10-cm) were determined by data of the geochemical survey in the city of Severobaikal'sk (Republic of Buryatia) in the summer of 2018. The priority pollutants of the topsoil in Severobaikal'sk are Sb, Pb, and W. Soils of the transport, industrial, and single-story residential zones are most strongly polluted. The intensive accumulation is typical for Sb, Pb, and Cu in the first two zones and for Sb, W, Pb, Cd, and Zn in the single-story residential zone. Three associations of HMMs-V-Cr-Co-Ni-Mn; Zn-Cd-Pb; and Sn-Sb-Mo-are inputted from the same sources, and their distribution in the soil cover of the city is similar. The accumulation of HMMs in the upper layer of urban soils is controlled by the content of Fe oxides, C-org, pH, and the type of land use, which determines the sources and level of anthropogenic impact on soils. The technogenic impact causes a change in the properties of urban soils, which enhances their ability to fix HMMs. There is no environmental hazard of soil pollution with HMMs for the city, but soils with low and moderately hazardous pollution levels occupy a third of the area of the single-story residential and industrial zones. Formation of several contrasting multielemental anomalies in soils on the bank of the Tyya River and near Lake Baikal is a danger for their waters due to the possibility of the inflow of toxic metals with surface and subsurface runoff.

J	Byard, RW; El Langlois, N				Byard, Roger W.; El Langlois, Neil			The 'canine rescue' phenomenon	MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW												While deaths caused by interactions with dogs in medico-legal situations most often involve trauma from attacks, in certain circumstances, deaths may occur from sharing environmental hazards that the animal has been exposed to during attempted rescues. Search of the Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA), Australia, autopsy database over a 16-year period from 2004 to 2020 found three such cases, including two women aged 46 and 61 years who were both killed in separate incidents after being struck by vehicles when they attempted to rescue dogs that had strayed onto busy roads. The final case was a 53-year-old man who drowned in a river while trying to rescue his dog. A review of Internet databases and news sources revealed other cases where would-be dog rescuers had drowned in rivers and the sea or had succumbed to hypothermia in frozen lakes and waterways. Other hazardous situations involve house fires, falls from heights, electrocution and envenomation. The characteristic features of these cases are of a dog (often a pet) getting itself into, or being found in, a dangerous situation, with owners or bystanders then attempting rescue. The dangers of the situation are either ignored or underestimated by the rescuers who often also misjudge the capacity of dogs to survive/self-rescue. Cases may therefore be encountered in forensic investigations where death or serious injury has occurred during attempts to protect an animal from particular types of environmental dangers. Unlike the owners, it is not infrequently documented that the dogs have survived the danger unharmed.					; Byard, Roger/JDD-8801-2023	Byard, Roger/0000-0002-0524-5942; 													0025-8024	2042-1818				JAN	2021	61	1					61	63	0025802420955074	10.1177/0025802420955074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0025802420955074		SEP 2020						32903134					WOS:000567845900001

Such area suffers from severe land degradation due to multiple interacting factors such as, overgrazing, camping and recreation, gravel and sand quarrying, military activities and natural processes. A restoration program was applied after the quarry surface irregularities were refilled and levelled. During the past 10 years of rehabilitation, noticeable healthy cover of Cornulaca sp. has been seen especially around an artificial lake and playas. The existence of such species in high density means that the restoration program was a success and was transitted from bare ground to Cornulaca and annual forb state. This is a lower state of Range State Transition Succession model, but it is better than bare soil. Cornulaca sp. is a native desert plant that grows in arid conditions. Despite its spiny leaves, it provides good food for camels and increases the supply of milk produced by lactating females. It is about 80 cm tall and has a stem that is branched from the base with new faster greenery growth in the summer. It shows good environmental potential to be managed as natural types used for restoration of degraded lands in desert areas.																			2522-8714	2522-8722	978-3-030-01683-8; 978-3-030-01682-1				2019							47	49		10.1007/978-3-030-01683-8_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01683-8_10													WOS:000594337200010

Therefore, delta C-13 analysis of Daphnia resting eggs (ephippia) in lake sediment records can potentially be used to reconstruct past in-lake availability of methane (CH4). However, detailed multilake studies demonstrating that delta C-13 values of recently deposited Daphnia ephippia (delta C-13(ephippia)) are systematically related to in-lake CH4 concentrations ([CH4](aq)) are still missing. We measured delta C-13(ephippia) from surface sediments of 15 small lakes in Europe, and compared these values with late-summer [CH4](aq). delta C-13(ephippia) ranged from -51.6 parts per thousand to -25.9 parts per thousand, and was strongly correlated with [CH4](aq) in the surface water and above the sediment (r -0.73 and -0.77, respectively), whereas a negative rather than the expected positive correlation was found with delta C-13 values of carbon dioxide (CO2) (r -0.54), and no correlation was observed with [CO2](aq). At eight sites, offsets between delta(13) C-CO2 and delta C-13(ephippia) exceeded offsets between delta C-13(CO2) and delta C-13(algae) reported in literature. delta C-13(ephippia) was positively correlated with delta C-13 values of sedimentary organic matter (r 0.54), but up to 20.7 parts per thousand lower in all except one of the lakes (average -6.1 parts per thousand). We conclude that incorporation of methanogenic carbon prior to ephippia formation must have been widespread by Daphnia in our study lakes, especially those with high [CH4](aq). Our results suggest a systematic relationship between delta C-13(ephippia) values and [CH4](aq) in small temperate lakes, and that delta C-13(ephippia) analysis on sediment records may provide insights into past changes in in-lake [CH4](aq).

Do headwater lakes moderate downstream temperature response to forest harvesting? Illustrating opportunities and obstacles associated with virtual experiments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												There are concerns that environmental changes, such as climate variability and forest harvesting, are altering stream thermal regimes and impacting aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies have suggested that the abundant headwater lakes found in northern landscapes may moderate downstream temperature response to forest harvesting. We investigated this hypothesis using a virtual experimental approach based on detailed field measurements made at boreal catchments in northern Sweden coupled with a process-based stream temperature model. We simulated streamside harvesting for stream reaches with and without a headwater lake. Mean daily summer stream temperature response to harvesting was generally between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees C higher for the stream without a lake than for the stream with a lake. However, during rain events the stream with the lake showed a greater stream temperature response than the stream without a lake. Headwater lakes typically store and delay runoff from rain events, augment baseflow, and have elevated outflow temperatures. These differences in upstream boundary conditions, in terms of flow and water temperature, were the key drivers for the contrasting harvest responses between streams with and without headwater lakes. These findings were generally consistent across different harvesting scenarios; however, uncertainty in the hyporheic term and post-harvest microclimate conditions influenced the simulated magnitude of post-harvest stream temperature response. Our study highlights the utility of virtual experiments for gaining insight on systems understanding but caution is needed when using models for predictions outside the conditions for which models are calibrated.

High summer evaporation rates deplete the volume of water within the wetland. However, this is compensated by perennial inflow via a permanent inlet from the River. This site provides an opportunity to explore the relative contribution of river and wetland diatomflora to the sediment record, and the fluvial and aerial contribution of radiometric isotopes to the system. The geochronological and biostratigraphic data provide an insight into the history of the water quality of Sinclair Flat. Evidence exists for the River being a source of sediments and isotopes and of diatom species typical of the main river channel. Prior to 1950, Sinclair Flat was an oligotrophic, oligosaline, clear-water wetland. The wetland shifted gradually to an environment that favoured clear-water benthic species, most likely as a consequence of changes following river regulation in the 1920s, although the capacity to date these sediments is limited. During the 1950s, the wetland became plankton dominated. Peaks in epiphytic diatoms during the 1960s suggest increased emergent macrophyte cover. The contemporary condition is of a connected, turbid, eutrophic and mesosaline lagoon. The ecological condition of Sinclair Flat has diverged considerably from its historical range of condition. This record supports evidence from upstream of widespread state switches in the Murray-Darling Basin floodplain wetlands. This record also lends considerable weight to modern studies attesting to the degraded state of the waterways of the Murray-Darling Basin and the impact of river regulation practices on the water quality of these ecosystems.

Abundant macroinvertebrates found in the different streams were common alpine species, although taxon richness, invertebrate density, and Simpson's diversity were highest in krenal and rhithral streams and lowest in kryal lake outlets. Cages filled with natural substrata were placed in riffle/run habitats in each stream and replicate cages were subsequently collected after 3, 8 and 30 days during early summer. Benthic and drifting invertebrates also were collected to compare with cage assemblages at each stream. Colonization of cages was rapid at most sites with high total densities and biomass occurring within 3 days. Simpson's diversity was highest on day 3, and decreased and stabilized by day 8 in all stream types. Chironomids, simuliids, and the mayfly Baetis alpinus were common early colonizers of cages at most streams. The turbellarian Crenobia alpina was a common colonizer of cages in temporary rhithral streams, and heptageniids were most common in rhithral stream cages. Chloroperlids were common colonizers of cages in krenal and kryal streams, and trichopterans were most common in cages of permanent krenal and temporary rhithral streams. Less common and rare taxa were late colonists of cages, having highest densities by day 30. The similar colonization patterns observed among alpine stream types may reflect altitudinal constraints on the regional species pool.

J	Fortner, RW; Corney, JR				Fortner, RW; Corney, JR			Great lakes educational needs assessment: Teachers' priorities for topics, materials, and training	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Teachers have an opportunity to create awareness of the importance of the Great Lakes by incorporating lake examples of major science/social concepts into their curricula. A survey of 300 middle school science teachers in watershed counties of Great Lakes states and Ontario revealed topics that were highest priority and that teachers wanted to know more about: water quality, environmental responsibility, water uses and conservation, and toxic chemicals. Topics of lowest priority were those dealing with shipping, water diversion, human history, careers and hobbies, and aesthetics (art, music, and literature of the lakes). Reasons for not including low priority topics were primarily based on their not being a part of the assigned curriculum for the responding science teachers. Responses regarding topic priorities and knowledge did not differ significantly by state/province, gender, grade level taught, early vs. late response, or whether the teachers had participated in a Great Lakes education workshop, with the primary exception that teachers who had been in a workshop generally rated exotic species as more important and were teaching more about it. Teachers claim to get most of their Great Lakes information from workshops and classes, with newspapers as the primary mass media source. They prefer to receive instructional materials in the form of classroom-ready activities and units, and when they seek additional education they prefer one-day or summer workshops for college credit. Providers of Great Lakes education resources should consider teacher preferences in designing materials and experiences, and consider infusion as a means of introducing non-science topics into science classes.																			0380-1330						2002	28	1					3	14		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70558-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70558-3													WOS:000174587400002

To address this question, plant and insect assemblages were described during summer 2019 and 2020 in two different forest habitats of northern Lower Michigan. The first habitat was a hardwood forest typical of secondary succession in the region.The second was a hydric forest located similar to 20 m from the hardwood forest which developed after lake sediment was deposited into a 10-ha area in the early 2000s. Reflecting this sediment deposition, soil of the hydric forest had higher water content and organic matter, and was dominated by the plant genera Solidago (Asterales: Asteraceae), Rubus (Rosales: Rosaceae), and Salix (Malpighiales: Salicaceae). In contrast, the hardwood forest had greater inorganic sediment and was dominated by Pteridium (Polypodiales: Dennstaedtiaceae), Carex (Poales: Cyperaceae), and Acer. Nearly 140,000 insect specimens were sampled using pitfall trapping, sweep netting, flight intercept trapping, ultraviolet light trapping, and yellow and blue pan trapping.The first three methods each sampled a unique insect assemblage, whereas the last three overlapped in taxa sampled. Insect assemblages of the two forests were distinct from each other using any of the six methods, with abundance of Pteridium and Salix (Sapindales: Sapindaceae) generally associating with changes in insect composition. A total of 41 insect taxa indicated the hydric forest and 14 indicated the hardwood forest. Insect richness increased with that of plants. These results demonstrate that differences in soil composition and plant assemblages associate with differences in forest insect assemblages, even of forests in very close proximity.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG 19	2022	51	4					716	727		10.1093/ee/nvac035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvac035		MAY 2022						35639617					WOS:000805266700001

Circulation and mixing in Sodus Bay due to water exchange with Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Embayments on large lakes may be affected by water exchange with the lake that, in turn, impact water quality in the embayment. In this study we examine the influence of hydrodynamic factors that may play a role in controlling water quality in Sodus Bay, the largest enclosed embayment on the U.S. shoreline of Lake Ontario. The motivation for this study was the occurrence of a blue-green algal (cyanobacterial) bloom in 2010, and the need to understand the factors that influence this and other water quality issues. A hydrodynamic model with high spatial and temporal resolution was applied and calibrated to field data collected in a detailed sampling program in 2013. The model, along with field data collected over several additional years, was then used to develop a comprehensive understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts on physical conditions in the bay. A primary result of this process is a determination of the importance of flow exchange between lake Ontario and Sodus Bay, particularly during lake upwelling periods that cause colder water to enter the bay as an underflow. Hydrodynamic features identified to have played a potential role in the bloom formation of 2010 include a lake upwelling event, strong stratification, and relatively warm conditions throughout much of the summer. Lack of continuous monitoring in 2010 precludes a specific comparison of the model and data when the bloom formed, but the model clearly shows conditions that would have led to a bloom, assuming other preconditions were in place. The customized hydrodynamic model provides opportunities for future ecological modeling, hypothesis development, and what-if scenario testing. This study reinforces the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between lakes and embayments, and their impacts on water quality. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Diversity and Transformation of the Community of Planktonic Freshwater Protists in the Estuarine Tributary Zone of a Large Plainland Reservoir: Metabarcoding of the 18S Ribosomal RNA Gene	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												-The first data on the composition and diversity of the summer community of planktonic protists in Usinsky Bay and the adjacent water area of the Kuybyshev Reservoir, obtained using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, are presented. In the composition of the protist community, 1150 operational taxonomic units (OTU) were found; among them, representatives of the Stramenopiles-Alveolata-Rhizaria (SAR) supergroup predominate. In the complete library, Stramenopiles predominate by the number of OTU, represented (in descending order) by Chrysophyceae (8.5%), Opalozoa (8.3%), Diatomea (4.7%), and Oomycetes (Peronosporomycetes) (3.7%); by the number of nucleotide sequences, Alveolata (62.0%) and, first of all, Ciliata (56.9%). There are four interconnected communities of protists: of the river area, the bay itself, the mouth zone, and the reservoir outside the influence of the bay (above the mouth). The communities of the river area and the reservoir area above the mouth have the greatest contrast in composition. In general, the estuarine system studied has features of both ecocline and ecotone. The competitive relationships with cyanobacteria have the main effect on the development of the phototrophic component of eukaryotic plankton. Cyanobacterial "bloom" also affects the structure of the heterotrophic part of the community, although this effect is less pronounced. The development of Archaeplastida, Rhizaria, and minor groups of protists positively correlates with the portion of Metazoa sequences in the samples, which reflects the intensity of the metazooplankton press. Sequences belonging to Bolidophyceae and Rhodelphida, the taxa rare for freshwater, were found. These findings expand the biogeography of these groups that were found so far in very few freshwater reservoirs.

It caused heavy damage in the region where the Colima and Tepic-Zacoalco grabens intersect. Many churches, houses and convents in the neighboring towns collapsed and severe deformation of the ground was observed in the area. Landslides apparently dammed the Ameca River for several days and the opening of large cracks was reported in the lowlands. The flow of natural springs and the level of Lake Zacoalco changed dramatically after the earthquake. All of these reports strongly suggest that a local fault was the source of this large and destructive earthquake. Based on the intensity data inferred from the historical reports, the 1568 event is perhaps the largest earthquake to date in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Compared to other well documented, large earthquakes that occurred in the volcanic belt in 1875, 1912 and 1920, the magnitude appears to be greater than 7.0 (M(W)). The Jalisco block is presumed to be rifting away from the North American plate. The Colima and Tepic-Zacoalco grabens, which bound the Jalisco block to the east and north, respectively, are apparently the boundaries where rifting is taking place in a complex and highly faulted environment. Based on the data available, it is impossible to identify the specific fault ruptured during the earthquake unequivocally. However, the occurrence of this large event in 1568 confirms that active deformation is still taking place in the Jalisco block.

Proxies such as mineral magnetism, textural analysis, carbon/nitrogen ratios, diatoms and pollen have been utilized in this research to elucidate the profound influence of climate on the region's history and cultural evolution over the past 2600 years (525 BCE to present). The diverse landscapes of the area have experienced significant climatic shifts, shaping its architectural and societal developments. The archeological record reveals a progression from prehistoric activity to the construction and habitation of 90 artificial caves, followed by the creation of early medieval temples and large-scale sculptures, culminating in further architectural consolidation during the medieval period which has a distinct record in the sediment characteristic and ecology of the wetland. This evolution reflects the region's dynamic interaction with its environment, shaped by alternating wet periods and environmental stress episodes. These changes are vividly captured in the five climatic zones identified in the sediment core from Bandhavgarh, underscoring the intricate relationship between human societies and climatic patterns over millennia.

Groundwater pathways play an important role in the year-round delivery of Cl to streams, but quantifying this pathway, including spatiotemporal variability and amount of Cl mass stored in the subsurface, is challenging. The objective of this study was to demonstrate, evaluate, and compare the potential applications of the geoelectrical techniques - electromagnetics (EM) and direct current (DC) resistivity - for mapping salt contamination in shallow urban groundwater and characterizing the groundwater pathways delivering Cl to urban streams. EM and DC surveys were conducted (3D mapping and 2D time-lapse) across a 20 m salt-impacted stream section and surrounding riparian zone that is located near an arterial road and parking lot. Groundwater samples and soil cores were also collected to validate the geoelectrical results. Both the EM and DC surveys detected high salt concentrations in the shallow subsurface (up to 3 m depth) near the road, parking lot, and stream; however, DC more accurately represented groundwater Cl concentrations. DC results were used to calculate the total Cl mass in the subsurface, with the spatial mass distribution used to infer the temporal variability in the subsurface salt plume. Finally, time-lapse DC showed that the highest groundwater salt concentrations existed near the stream between June and October - this is expected to contribute to the elevated salt concentrations in the stream during summer months. This study has shown that EM and DC can be useful for identifying groundwater salt concentration, storage, and transport in a non-intrusive and efficient manner, making them valuable field tools for characterizing and quantifying groundwater salt pathways to urban streams.					; Robinson, Clare/E-4625-2012	Roy, James/0000-0002-1804-2917; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 20	2023	905								167225	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167225		SEP 2023						37741411					WOS:001088816900001

Cyanobacteria and Toxic Blooms in the Great Mazurian Lakes System: Biodiversity and Toxicity	POLISH RIVER BASINS AND LAKES: BIOLOGICAL STATUS AND WATER MANAGEMENT, PT II	Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series											The Great Mazurian Lakes System (GMLS), located in the northeastern part of Poland, is an extremely valuable area in terms of natural environment value, tourism, and local economy. The system is divided into two parts - the northern meso-eutrophic and the southern eutrophic. GMLS are lakes with very high taxonomic diversity of phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria are very often predominant in the species composition and biomass. The presence of cyanobacteria belonging to 14 different families from the orders of Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, Synechococcales, and Chroococcales was recorded throughout the system. The GMLS has undergone significant changes over the recent decades which affected the taxonomic composition and dominant species of cyanobacteria. Particularly the southern part was subject to significant changes, from rapid eutrophication in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in massive blooms of cyanobacteria, to a significant improvement in water quality in the 1990s and a reduction of cyanobacteria biomass. However, cyanobacteria are the dominant component of phytoplankton up to the present, although there are no dense blooms in recent years. Many of the cyanobacteria taxa in the GMLS can potentially produce toxins. Hepatotoxic microcystins are the most common cyanotoxins in freshwater, and in GMLS they sometimes reached significant concentrations in water. Studies have shown that the main producers of microcystins in GMLS are genera Microcystis and Planktothrix.

Effects of glacial retreat on proglacial streams and riparian zones in the Coast and North Cascade Mountains	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Proglacial stream development was studied in coastal British Columbia and Washington, focusing on reaches exposed by post-Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier retreat, to address three principal questions: (i) Does the legacy of LIA glaciation influence the evolution of channel morphology? (ii) How long does it take for riparian forest to establish following glacier retreat? (iii) Can newly exposed proglacial streams provide suitable fish habitat? Channel morphologies were identified by field surveys of 69 reaches in 10 catchments. Riparian forest development and potential fish habitat were characterized in those reaches and an additional 22 catchments using GIS analysis. The landscape template imposed by the Quaternary glaciation appears to override most of the modern effects of the LIA in controlling channel-reach morphology. Binary logistic regression analysis identified elevation and time since deglaciation as primary controls on the presence of riparian forest. At higher elevations, establishment of morphologically functional riparian forest could take several centuries, prolonged by channel instability associated with post-LIA sediment inputs. Of the recently deglaciated streams included in this analysis, the majority (86%) of the total length was of suitable gradient for fish and could be accessed either by downstream populations or from adjacent lakes. Predicted maximum weekly average stream temperature (MWAT) indicated that the post-LIA study streams were thermally suitable for cold-water fish. A future scenario of glacier loss would cause a 14% decline in accessible cold-water thermal habitat in post-LIA streams. Decreased summer flows due to glacier retreat could further limit usable habitat by reducing stream depths and wetted perimeters.

In three summer experiments with colonies collected from the bottom of oligotrophic lakes of low inorganic carbon concentrations dissolved inorganic C, DIC), metabolism and pigment density of colonies were scaled to their surface area as most algal filaments were confined to a 2-mm-thick outer shell. Nostoc absorbed 96% of incident light from the surface to the center because of high areal pigment density, but absorbed photons were used with low quantum efficiency (1138 mmol O-2 mol(-1) photon) and photosynthesis was low relative to dark respiration (2.0-5.4). Therefore, N. zetterstedtii is threatened by reduced light availability and only extended to lake depths receiving about 12% of surface irradiance, whereas mosses, characeans, and angiosperms with thin photosynthetic tissues grew deeper (3.1-7.5% of surface irradiance). Nostoc ameliorated the restrictions of low lake DIC and long diffusion paths by active transport that could extract most external DIC, accumulate DIC in the colony 150-fold above external concentrations, and retain respiratory CO2. The energy cost of solute transport and gel formation in Nostoc colonies and extensive self shading restrict their potential growth, whereas colony formation should prevent grazing and increase longevity and nutrient recirculation. Nostoc zetterstedtii has become one of rarest freshwater macroalgae because of widespread lake eutrophication reducing water transparency and increasing competition from taller and faster-growing stands of filamentous algae and higher plants.

Lithium isotopes and implications on chemical weathering in the catchment of Lake Donggi Cona, northeastern Tibetan Plateau	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												This study presents lithium (Li) isotope ratios (delta Li-7) for rocks, sediments, suspended particulate material, and dissolved Li from the Lake Donggi Cona catchment, located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The average delta Li-7 = +1.9% of the bedrocks is estimated from local loess. delta Li-7 values decrease progressively within the sediment cascade from loess, to river and lake floor sediments. The lake floor sediments average at -0.7%. The difference between bedrock and lake sediments reflects the preferential fractionation of dissolved 6 Li into clay minerals (mostly illite) in the weathering zone and grain-size sorting during fluvial sediment transport. The delta Li-7 values of stream and lake water samples range from +13.6 to +20.8%, whereas thermal waters fall between +5.9 and +11.6%. The delta Li-7 values of lake water samples are close to +17% and reflect mixing of waters from two perennial inflows and thermal waters. Dissolved Li in streams represents an integrated isotopic signal derived from soil solutions in the weathering zone. An apparent isotopic fractionation of -17.8 perpendicular to 1.6% (alpha(sec-sol) similar to 0.982) between secondary minerals and solution was determined. An inflow that drains a sub-catchment in the north carries a high proportion of thermal waters. Despite of the high proportion of admixed thermal waters with high Li concentrations and low delta Li-7, this stream has the highest delta Li-7 values of about + 21%. This is consistent with admixing of thermal waters to solutions in the weathering zone and subsequent fractionation by preferential uptake of isotopically light dissolved Li into secondary phases. Based on Li isotope ratios of the dissolved and solid export flux from the weathering zone we calculated that around five times more Li is exported in particles than dissolved in streams. An average delta Li-7 value of about +17% of most streams and the lake is reflecting a low weathering intensity and chemical weathering rate of about 4 t/km(2)/a. Low weathering rates and an erosion dominated weathering system are consistent with moderate precipitations, the cold climate, and the high relief of the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mann, GE; Wagenmaker, RB; Sousounis, PJ				Mann, GE; Wagenmaker, RB; Sousounis, PJ			The influence of multiple lake interactions upon lake-effect storms	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Mesoscale disturbances in close proximity to one another typically undergo process interactions, which ultimately may result in the formation of a disturbance on the scale of the combined mesoscale disturbances. Embedded within this combined disturbance, some semblance of the incipient individual mesoscale disturbances may be preserved, especially in instances when the individual forcing mechanisms are fixed in space, as in the case of the Great Lakes. Studies have shown that during prolonged cold air outbreaks, collective lake disturbances can originate from the organization of individual lake-scale disturbances. These collective lake disturbances may, through scale interactions, alter the behavior of the contributing individual lake-scale disturbances and the embedded lake-effect storms. Factor separation decomposition of the Great Lakes system indicates that various interactions among lake-scale processes contribute to the overall development of the regional-scale disturbance, which can modulate embedded lake-effect snowbands. Contributions from these interactions tend to offset the individual lake contributions, especially during the development of the collective lake disturbance, but vary spatially and temporally. As the regional-scale disturbance matures, lake-lake interactions then accentuate the individual lake contributions. Specifically, the modulation of lake-effect snowbands was translational, intensional, and in some instances morphological in nature. Near Lake Michigan, processes attributed to Lake Superior (upstream lake) were direct and synergistic (indirect) resulting in a time delay of maximum snowfall intensity, while processes attributed to the downstream lakes were primarily synergistic resulting in an overall decrease in snowfall intensity. Furthermore, as the collective lake disturbance matured, Lake Superior-induced processes contributed to a significant morphological change in the Lake Michigan lake-effect snowbands.

Flowering time responses to warming drive reproductive fitness in a changing Arctic	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate, leading to earlier spring conditions and plant phenology. It is often unclear to what degree changes in reproductive fitness (flower, fruit and seed production) are a direct response to warming versus an indirect response through shifting phenology. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative importance of these direct and indirect pathways and project the net effects of warming on plant phenology and reproductive fitness under current and future climate scenarios. Methods We used two long-term datasets on 12 tundra species in the Canadian Arctic as part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). Phenology and reproductive fitness were recorded annually on tagged individual plants at both Daring Lake, Northwest Territories (64 degrees 52' N, - 111 degrees 35' W) and Alexandra Fiord, Nunavut (78 degrees 49' N, - 75 degrees 48' W). The plant species encompassed a wide taxonomic diversity across a range of plant functional types with circumpolar/boreal distributions. We used hierarchical Bayesian structural equation models to compare the direct and indirect effects of climate warming on phenology and reproductive fitness across species, sites and years. Key Results We found that warming, both experimental and ambient, drove earlier flowering across species, which led to higher numbers of flowers and fruits produced, reflecting directional phenotypic selection for earlier flowering phenology. Furthermore, this indirect effect of climate warming mediated through phenology was generally about two to three times stronger than the direct effect of climate on reproductive fitness. Under future climate predictions, individual plants showed a similar to 2- to 4.5-fold increase in their reproductive fitness (flower counts) with advanced flowering phenology. Conclusions Our results suggest that, on average, the benefits of early flowering, such as increased development time and subsequent enhanced reproductive fitness, might outweigh its risks. Overall, this work provides important insights into population-level consequences of phenological shifts in a warming Arctic over multi-decadal time scales.					; Elphinstone, Cassandra/ABH-3113-2021	Collins, Courtney/0000-0001-5455-172X; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521													0305-7364	1095-8290				FEB 12	2024	135	1-2			SI		255	268		10.1093/aob/mcae007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcae007		FEB 2024						38252914					WOS:001159471200001

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), a widely used hydrological model, can simulate various ecohydrological processes on land and subsequently route the water quality constituents through surface and subsurface waters. So far, in-stream solute transport algorithms of the SWAT model have only been minimally revised, even though it has been acknowledged that an improvement of in-stream process representation can contribute to better model performance with respect to water quality. In this study, we aim to incorporate a new and improved solute transport model into the SWAT model framework. The new process-based model was developed using in-stream process equations from two well established models-the One-dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage model and the Enhanced Stream Water Quality Model. The modified SWAT model (Mir-SWAT) was tested for water quality predictions in a study watershed in Germany. Compared to the standard SWAT model, Mir-SWAT improved dissolved oxygen (DO) predictions by removing extreme low values of DO (<6 mg/L) simulated by SWAT. Phosphate concentration peaks were reduced during high flows and a better match of daily predicted and measured values was attained using the Mir-SWAT model (R-2 = 0.17, NSE = -0.65, RSR = 1.29 with SWAT; R-2 = 0.28, NSE = -0.04, RSR = 1.02 with Mir-SWAT). In addition, Mir-SWAT performed better than the SWAT model in terms of Chlorophyll-a content particularly during winter months, improving the NSE and RSR for monthly average Chl-a by 74 and 42%, respectively. With the new model improvements, we aim to increase confidence in the stream solute transport component of the model, improve the understanding of nutrient dynamics in the stream, and to extend the applicability of SWAT for reach-scale analysis and management.

Bush Blue Lake 274, BBL). Plant survival was reduced when flooding was imposed at postflowering growth stages, but most plants survived when flooded before flowering or when reproductive development was prevented by deflowering. Early yields of surviving plants were very low in all flooded treatments, regardless of timing, in both years. Total yield response to timing of flooding was linear in 1987, with lowest yields when flooding was imposed at later growth stages. The trend was not linear in 1988, but in both years the latest flooding treatment (36 days after planting) had few surviving plants and no measurable pod yield. Additional greenhouse experiments revealed that leaf conductance of BBL and another bean cultivar, Luna (LN), declined within the first day of flooding. This decline was concomitant with one in leaf water potential and photosynthesis (Pn) in BBL, but decline of these responses occurred 1 to 2 days later for LN. After 4 days of flooding, Pn fell to near 0 for BBL, and to 15% of the prestress value for LN. Pn of both cultivars had recovered to 18.5 mumol.m-2.s-1 10 days after termination of flooding. LN had a larger adventitious root biomass, higher percentage of adventitious roots, and a consistently lower leaf : root ratio than BBL during recovery.

Recent evidence suggests an acceleration of glacier mass loss in several key mountain regions. Glacier recession implies landscape changes in the glacial zone, the origin of new lakes and activation of natural disaster processes, catastrophic mudflows, ice avalanches, outburst floods, etc. The absence or inadequacy of such information results in financial and human losses. A more comprehensive evaluation of glacier changes is imperative to assess ice contributions to global sea level rise and the future of water resources from glacial basins. One of the urgent steps is a full inventory of all ice bodies and their changes. The first estimation of glacier state and glacier distribution on the territory of the former Soviet Union has been done in the USSR Glacier Inventory (UGI) published in 1965-1982. The UGI is based on topographic maps and air photos and reflects the status of the glaciers in the 1940s-1970s. There is information about 28 884 glaciers with an area of 7830.75 km(2) in the inventory. It covers 25 glacier systems in Northern Eurasia. In the 1980s the UGI has been transformed into digital form as a part of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). Recent satellite data provide a unique opportunity to look again at these glaciers and to evaluate changes in glacier extent for the second part of the 20th century. About 15 000 glacier outlines for the Caucasus, Polar Urals, Pamir Alay, Tien Shan, Altai, Kamchatka and Russian Arctic have been derived from ASTER and Landsat imagery and can be used for glacier change evaluation. Results of the analysis indicate the steady trend in glacier shrinkage in all mountain regions for the second part of the 20th century. Glacier area loss for the studied regions varies from 13% (Tien Shan) to 22.3% (Polar Urals). The common driver, most likely, is an increase in summer air temperature. There is also a very large variability in the degree of individual glacier degradation, very much depending on the morphology and local meteorological conditions.

Unlike most forests in the southwestern United States, the forests of the SSPM have never been logged and have experienced only light grazing in recent years, and wildfires have not been suppressed until recent decades. The SSPM represents one of the best examples of an intact presettlement forest in the California Floristic Province. We investigated the mode of seed dispersal of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) in the SSPM, and compared it to that from the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, to determine how this process might differ between nearly pristine and heavily altered forests. We found that seed dispersal appears to occur by the same means in both forests (i.e., scatter hoarding of seeds by rodents), but that seedling establishment is much less successful in the SSPM. We considered several hypotheses for why this difference might exist, including the size of seed crops, fire regimes, climate change, grazing by domestic ungulates, and lack of facilitation by shrubs (i.e., nurse plants), but none of these explanations appears adequate to account for the difference. Instead, we suggest that the slow rate of seedling establishment at the SSPM is due to a greater consumption of seeds cached by California chipmunks (Tamias obscurus), who experience a relatively long period of euthermic winter activity in the warm climate of the SSPM. This greater consumption leaves few seeds to germinate. Future studies should test the relative importance of these alternative causes for low seedling recruitment at the SSPM.

J	RACINE, CH				RACINE, CH			TUNDRA FIRE EFFECTS ON SOILS AND 3 PLANT-COMMUNITIES ALONG A HILL-SLOPE GRADIENT IN THE SEWARD PENINSULA, ALASKA	ARCTIC												During summer 1977, wildfires burned extensive area of low arctic tundra in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. The present study was initiated in July 1978 to determine the effects of these fires on tundra on soils and vegetation. Nine 10 m x 1 m permanent belt transects were established at regular intervals along the topographic gradient of a burned hill-slope in the central Seward Peninsula near Imuruk Lake. Soil characteristics and plant species density and cover were determined in each of the 90 1-m2 plots on this slope during July of both 1978 and 1979. Soils and vegetation was quantitatively sampled on this slope in 1973, providing pre-fire comparisons; a sedge tussock-shrub tundra community with mud circles occupied the poorly drained footslope and a birch and ericaceous shrub tundra community with elongate turf-banked frost boils had developed on the moderately well-drained backslope. The broad, poorly-drained summit of this slope was occupied by sedge-shrub tundra with low-centered polygons. The severity of burning in July 1977 varied along this slope with moderate to heavy burning of the birch and ericaceous shrub tundra and light to moderate burning of the sedge tussock-shrub tundra and sedge-shrub tundra communities. Post-fire (1978 and 1979) changes in plant cover, species composition and soil thaw depths vary with position on the slope and burning severity. The relationship of these changes to natural succession in the absence of fire is discussed.																			0004-0843	1923-1245					1981	34	1					71	84																WOS:A1981LT42200010

Holocene relationships between climate, waterfowl, and lacustrine nutrient cycling at Kettle Lake, North Dakota, USA	HOLOCENE												Avian populations can substantially influence lacustrine nutrient loading and biogeochemical cycling through guano deposition. Here, we examine the influence of climate-forced avian migration throughout the Holocene on Kettle Lake, North Dakota, using stable nitrogen and carbon isotope values (delta N-15, delta C-13) of lake sediment organic matter. Carbon content and delta C-13 values are negatively correlated with delta N-15 and appear to be driven by changes in charcoal abundance and watershed vegetation, respectively. We find enriched delta N-15 values when the guano mineral struvite is present in the lake sediment core in the early to Mid-Holocene. A strong delta N-15-percent Nitrogen content relationship during periods with struvite, relative to periods without struvite, indicates that guano deposition from mass bird visitations altered past nitrogen cycle processes, likely through enhanced denitrification. These results attest to the ability of waterfowl to alter lacustrine N-cycling in a mid-continental North American lake, and indicate that paleo-N data in this particular lake are recording a unique history that does not necessarily represent regional paleoenvironmental conditions. However, a significant, positive relationship between delta N-15 and Ambrosia and Amaranthaceae pollen abundance suggests avian visitation and its impacts on the N-cycle occurred during periods of anomalously wet summers superimposed on the background conditions of early to Mid-Holocene drought.

J	FOGG, GE				FOGG, GE			TANSLEY REVIEW .30. THE PHYTOPLANKTONIC WAYS OF LIFE	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The adaptations of phytoplankton to life in suspension in water are considered with particular reference to hydromechanical factors ranging from molecular motion to ocean currents. The smallest phytoplankton, the picoplankton (0.2-2.0-mu-m), are the best adapted to the physico-chemical environment of the open waters of seas and lakes and, other things being equal, can out-compete the larger forms. The picophytoplankton are an autotrophic component in a microbial community, the ultraplankton, which also includes bacteria and flagellates up to about 20-mu-m in linear dimensions. This community is a highly dynamic and self-contained equilibrium system operating within a domain dominated by molecular diffusion. Within the photic zone it is limited, not by nutrient supply, but by its internal predator-prey relationships. It appears to be cosmopolitan, both in the sea and in freshwaters, to vary little either in time or space in species composition or in biomass concentration, and to contribute a minimum of organic carbon to higher trophic levels. There appears to be a fundamental divide in form and function between this and the microplankton, composed of organisms larger than about 20-mu-m. This community can only develop when nutrient levels are in excess of the concentrations required by the picoplankton. It is opportunistic, non-equilibrium in its dynamics, and highly variable in floristic composition and biomass concentration. Its life processes are dominated by turbulence. Nutrient supply is largely determined by turbulent eddy diffusion and movement of the organisms relative to the water mass. The microphytoplankton falls broadly into two types, one of which, exemplified by the diatoms, depends on turbulence to maintain it in the photic zone and the other, exemplified by the dinoflagellates and colony-forming cyanobacteria, relies on motility or buoyancy control to position it in a relatively stable water column so as to have best access to light and nutrients. The waxing and waning of microplankton populations is largely determined by hydrography and their floristic compositions by the interactions of the daily and seasonal rhythms of the organisms with the periodicities in the environment. In contrast to the ultraplankton microplankton species show distinct differences in biogeographical distribution. Throughout the discussion attention is drawn to the intimate relationships between the activities of phytoplankton and those of viruses, bacteria and zooplankton and the impossibility of getting a proper understanding of the physiology of the phytoplankton if they are considered in isolation.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				JUN	1991	118	2					191	232		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1991.tb00974.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1991.tb00974.x								33874179					WOS:A1991FU57700001

We reconstruct temporal changes in carbon resources sustaining chironomid biomass over the last 14,000 years, by means of carbon stable isotope analysis of subfossil chironomids (delta C-13(HC)), with the aim of identifying the response of carbon processing in the benthic food web to climate change. We find a negative linear correlation between reconstructed summer mean air temperature and delta C-13(HC) values, revealing that (i) the contribution of allochthonous organic carbon to the chironomid biomass is high during the coldest and low-productive period, (ii) the aquatic organic matter is the main carbon source during intermediate climate conditions, and (iii) a significant part of the chironomid biomass is sustained by methane-derived carbon during the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the Bolling-Allerod. This study confirms that climate change may significantly affect the recycling process of organic carbon in the benthic food web of small lakes. However, deforestation and agricultural practices within the catchment area induced important organic matter inputs into the lake sediments, which seem to disrupt the observed relationship between climate variability and carbon processing in the benthic food web. In this context, complementary studies are needed to better understand the combined effects of the ongoing global warming and human activities on the lake carbon cycling.

Tensile strength and knot security of five suture materials exposed to natural summer conditions of a temperate lake	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Objective: Wild fish and other aquatic ectotherms are often subjected to procedures during field research that require wound closure using sutures. A variety of absorbable sutures are available for such purposes, yet degradation processes are highly dependent on temperature, and the environments in which wild ectotherms are released are almost always colder than the conditions for which absorbable sutures are typically designed (i.e., similar to 37 degrees C). We therefore studied the degradation of various suture materials under a set of biologically relevant conditions for temperate freshwater fish. Methods: Using a force gauge, we tested the tensile strengths and knot securities of loops tied with five different absorbable suture materials (PDS-II, dyed coated Vicryl, undyed coated Vicryl, plain gut, and chromic gut) prior to and during submersion in a temperate lake over an 8-week period. Result: The naturally derived collagen-based suture materials (i.e., plain gut and chromic gut) exhibited major decreases in tensile strength within 2 weeks of submersion but maintained relatively high knot security throughout the study period. The synthetic suture loops had poorer initial knot securities that increased following submersion and showed little to no evidence of degradation after 8 weeks. Conclusion: Variable rates of absorbable suture degradation, or lack thereof, were observed. We discuss the implications of these trends for fish welfare considerations such as suture retention, wound healing, inflammation, and infection under natural conditions.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Reid, Connor/0000-0001-9431-9044; 													0899-7659	1548-8667				SEP	2023	35	3					143	153		10.1002/aah.10182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aah.10182		JUN 2023						36934298					WOS:001021955400001
J	So, JS; Sand-Jensen, K; Baastrup-Spohr, L				Stage So, Jonas; Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars			Temporal development of biodiversity of macrophytes in newly established lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Every year, a vast number of wetlands are constructed to restore ecosystem function and biodiversity, thus counteracting massive historical losses by reclamation to farmland. However, our knowledge of the long-term effects on biodiversity, particularly of large systems such as lakes, is very limited. Our objective was to follow the development of macrophytes over 3-4 decades in 24 new, shallow, eutrophic lakes in order to test the hypotheses that: (1) species richness reaches a maximum after some years and then declines; and (2) species composition changes substantially from small early colonisers to taller, competitive later colonisers, which causes ongoing high beta-diversity. A generalised linear mixed-effect model showed that species richness was related to lake size, phosphorus concentration and spatial setting, which are known to influence natural lakes as well. Moreover, species composition and richness were affected by lake age. Species colonised rapidly and richness peaked at an intermediate age and then declined. Temporal species turnover within lakes was high in three lake age groups of <= 10, 11-20 or >20 years since establishment, although lowest after 11-20 years. Species replacement tended to contribute most to beta-diversity in the youngest lakes, whereas richness fluctuated in older lakes and appeared to contribute most to temporal turnover there. Early colonisers in <= 10-year-old lakes were commonly replaced by tall canopy-forming species in 11-20-year-old lakes, probably as a result of increasing competition for light and space over time. After 20 years, rootless Ceratophyllum submersum as well as species with floating and emergent leaves became dominant, potentially due to the gradual accumulation of more organic sediment difficult to root and grow in, along with gradually reduced light penetration in the water. Establishing new lakes for biodiversity remains a challenge because of the falling richness and continuous species turnover with lake age, but our results suggest that constructing large, nutrient-poor lakes in species-rich landscapes ensures the best prerequisites for obtaining diverse communities.

Microbial Activity Response to Solar Radiation across Contrasting Environmental Conditions in Salar de Huasco, Northern Chilean Altiplano	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												In high altitude environments, extreme levels of solar radiation and important differences of ionic concentrations over narrow spatial scales may modulate microbial activity. In Salar de Huasco, a high-altitude wetland in the Andean mountains, the high diversity of microbial communities has been characterized and associated with strong environmental variability. Communities that differed in light history and environmental conditions, such as nutrient concentrations and salinity from different spatial locations, were assessed for bacterial secondary production (BSP, H-3-leucine incorporation) response from short-term exposures to solar radiation. We sampled during austral spring seven stations categorized as: (a) source stations, with recently emerged groundwater (no-previous solar exposure); (b) stream running water stations; (c) stations connected to source waters but far downstream from source points; and (d) isolated ponds disconnected from ground sources or streams with a longer isolation and solar exposure history. Very high values of 0.25 mu E m(-2) s(-1), 72 W m(-2) and 12 W m(-2) were measured for PAR, UVA, and UVB incident solar radiation, respectively. The environmental factors measured formed two groups of stations reflected by principal component analyses (near to groundwater sources and isolated systems) where isolated ponds had the highest BSP and microbial abundance (35 microalgae taxa, picoeukaryotes, nanoflagellates, and bacteria) plus higher salinities and PO43- concentrations. BSP short-term response (4 h) to solar radiation was measured by H-3-leucine incorporation under four different solar conditions: full sun, no UVB, PAR, and dark. Microbial communities established in waters with the longest surface exposure (e.g., isolated ponds) had the lowest BSP response to solar radiation treatments, and thus were likely best adapted to solar radiation exposure contrary to ground source waters. These results support our light history (solar exposure) hypothesis where the more isolated the community is from ground water sources, the better adapted it is to solar radiation. We suggest that factors other than solar radiation (e.g., salinity, PO43-, NO3-) are also important in determining microbial productivity in heterogeneous environments such as the Salar de Huasco.

Artificial substrate samplers were used to collect Green Sturgeon eggs between 2008 and 2012 and in a reach of the river 94 river kilometers (rkm) long (rkm 426-332). A total of 268 eggs and 5 posthatch larvae were sampled from seven identified spawning sites between April 2 and July 7, primarily from medium gravel substrates. At these sites the mean water column velocities were 0.8 m/s at depths ranging from 0.6 to 11.3 m (6.4 +/- 2.3 m, mean +/- SD). We noted an average discharge of 314 m(3)/s and a median turbidity value of 3.9 NTU during estimated spawning events. Spawning at all sites occurred when average water temperatures were 13.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C and during water year types ranging from critically dry to wet. Green Sturgeon eggs averaged 4.11 +/- 0.20 mm in diameter (n = 207), were very adhesive, and were between developmental stages 2 (just fertilized) and 44 (posthatch larva). We estimated that eggs were collected from a minimum of 54 different spawning events, based on sample date and location, egg developmental stage at capture, and water temperatures. Green Sturgeon spawning data indicates there is spatial separation from sympatric White Sturgeon A. transmontanus, but some temporal overlap exists. The thermally and hydrologically managed Sacramento River with its numerous diversions and competing water demands appears to have an approximate reach of 120 rkm in the 405-km-long river that is favorable for Green Sturgeon spawning in most years. Management decisions need to assess and incorporate the spawning habitat requirements of Green Sturgeon and coordinate this information with that of endangered winter-run Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha while attempting to meet the diverse demands of the limited Sacramento River water resources.

Zooplankton is sensitive to changes in the ecological state of different types of reservoirs. The article analyses differences and similarities of zooplankton communities in 10 lakes of Kisegach - Miassovo hydrological system of Chelyabinsk region (Russia). The current research aims at identifying taxonomic structure of zooplankton communities of the lakes in Chelyabinsk region (Russia) and stating the influence of some abiotic factors on its formation. Integrated samples were gathered in summer 2015 - 2019. The given paper studied the correlation of the main taxonomic groups of zooplankton, marked a regular decrease in the number of zooplankton species under adverse environment. When the trophic level of water in natural fresh lakes changes in the direction of oligotrophic-mesotrophic-eutrophic, the total number of zooplankton decreases from 400.90 individuals per L-1 to 106.06 individuals per L-1. In the same direction, the number of Cladocera representatives decreases (from 362.03 individuals per L-1 to 66.34 individuals per L-1) and the number of Copepoda representatives decreases (from 34.01 individuals per L 12.67 individuals per L-1), and the number of Rotifera representatives increases (from 6.97 individuals per L-1 to 26.60 individuals per L-1).

Along its course, it collects water from portions of two Canadian provinces and 41% of the conterminous United States. Although greatly altered for navigation and flood control throughout much of its length, the Mississippi River remains an important fishery resource that provides habitat for 188 species of fishes and recreational and commercial fishing opportunities. The objectives of this chapter are to describe the contemporary fisheries habitat throughout the Mississippi River, identify how management to achieve human benefits influences the fishes and their habitats, and summarize efforts to conserve and enhance fish habitat. The 826-km headwater reach is entirely in Minnesota and remains largely unaltered. The reaches that extend 1,059 km from St. Anthony Falls, Minnesota to above the confluence with the Missouri River near St. Louis, Missouri have been altered by impoundment that has affected floodplain function, increased sedimentation of backwaters, and homogenized the formerly diverse aquatic habitats. After the confluence with the Missouri River, the Mississippi River flows freely for 1,849 km to the Gulf of Mexico. The alterations of the free-flowing reaches of greatest significance to the fisheries resource are reducing the duration and height of the flood pulse as a consequence of shortening the river channel, disconnection of the river from its historic and present floodplain, and loss of secondary channel-island complexes. Engineering features to improve commercial navigation have also added habitat and, when wisely manipulated, can be used to rehabilitate habitat. Some aspects of water quality have improved, but legacy chemicals and nutrient-laden inflows and sediments remain problems. Although true restoration in the sense of restoring all environmental conditions to an unaltered state is unlikely, the future value of the Mississippi River as a fisheries resource will depend on actively maintaining diverse and accessible aquatic habitats to support food webs and water quality suitable for fishes.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-44-8				2016	84						3	34																WOS:000381782500001
J	Andreas, EL; Cash, BA				Andreas, EL; Cash, BA			A new formulation for the Bowen ratio over saturated surfaces	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Analytical expressions are presented for calculating the Bowen ratio, Bo = H-s/H-L, from a quantity Bo* that is derived primarily from the surface temperature T-s and the assumption that the near-surface air is saturated (but not supersaturated) with water vapor. Here H-s is the surface sensible heat flux, and H-L is the surface latent heat flux. These analytical expressions obtained from 17 tabulations of H-s, H-L, and T-s taken from the literature were examined. These data came from experiments over snow-covered ground and sea ice and over water in the Great Lakes, the marginal seas, and the open ocean at a variety of latitudes. Surface temperatures ranged from -41 degrees to 29 degrees C. Over 90% of the data fell into one of three heat flux cases: H-s > 0 and H-L > 0, H-s < 0 and H-L < 0, or H-s < 0 and H-L > 0. From the tabulated data, a single equation that relates Bo to Bo* (T-s) for each case is developed, unifying the prediction of Bo from T-s for most saturated surfaces on earth. Last, the sensitivity of Bo to uncertainties in the quantities needed to estimate it is investigated. This analysis suggests that the analytical expressions should generally predict Bo to better than +/-40%. It is concluded that predicting Bo from surface temperature alone yields good results for large-scale or longer time (e.g., daily) averages but is less accurate when both the spatial and temporal averaging are limited. Consequently, the results will probably find most use in global climate models, in coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere models, and for data assimilation and quality control.																			0894-8763					AUG	1996	35	8					1279	1289		10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1279:ANFFTB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1279:ANFFTB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1996VE12800010

Although the association of these different social sources have been studied independently, it has yet to be elucidated which of these sources is most highly associated to the presentation of these three qualities. For this study, high school students from a northern community completed a series of online questionnaires. A series of hierarchical regressions showed each source of care accounted for unique variance in the presentation of resilience and strengths, with perceived care from school staff and family accounting for the greatest variance, emphasizing the equal importance of examining the school and home environment. Further research is needed to understand how teachers and the school culture are associated with personal growth.																			0002-4805	1923-1857					2020	66	2					148	169																WOS:000817758800003

For this reason, an afternoon thermal precipitation event is considered and simulated by applying the numerical meteorological model MM5. Sequential sensitivity tests showed that the precipitation event is satisfactorily predicted by the model by applying Kain-Fritsch-2 convective parameterization scheme even in the finest domain of 2 Km. The comparison of simulations with unmodified and modified land use data showed that the humidity over and around the lakes, in the afternoon, is mainly controlled by air masses coming from the Ionian Sea. In other words, the lakes do not affect the events via their contribution in humidity and this is one of the reasons that thermal precipitation in Epirus does not occur exclusively in the areas of Ioannina and Metsovo but also in many other inland places. The role of the lakes is found to be indirect, as they influence the air flows above them and thus affect the updrafts which cause precipitation.																			1106-5516		978-960-7475-51-0				2013																								WOS:000346067900172

The Egirdir Lake has been studied within the framework of the Basin Protection Plan Special Provisions of the Egirdir Lake. The impact of runoff is taken into account in determining protection zones of the surface water reservoirs in Turkey. An approach that emphasizes the impact of groundwater flow in addition to the surface runoff has been adopted in this study. Water in Lake Egirdir is often classified as the Class II water according to terrestrial water resources quality criteria in Water Pollution Control Regulation of Turkey. The geological and hydrogeological studies reveal a significant amount of groundwater recharge into the Egirdir Lake through carbonate rocks and alluvial deposits outcropping in the basin, which is why Egirdir Lake still has a less contaminated water quality in spite of heavy pollutants. For this purpose, groundwater flow is prominently used in defining protection zones and surface runoff as well. The inner protection zone, which is defined as the 50-day travel time, and the outer protection zone, defined as the 400-day travel time, were estimated by infiltrometer and pumping tests in alluvium. Pumping tests results were used for the determination of hydraulic conductivities and groundwater levels for the determination of hydraulic gradients. Protection zones in karstic areas are based on the vulnerability map and large karstic springs.

Here we investigate two large rock avalanches in the Obersee valley of the Glarner Alps, Switzerland, providing detailed mapping of landslide and related Quaternary phenomena, revised volume estimates for each event and surface exposure dating of rock avalanche deposits. The Rautispitz rock avalanche originated from the southern flank of the Obersee valley, releasing approximately 91 million m(3) of limestone on steeply-dipping bedding planes. Debris had maximum horizontal travel distance of similar to 5000 m, a fahrboeschung angle (relating fall height to length) of 18 degrees, and was responsible for the creation of Lake Obersee; deposits are more than 130 m thick in places. The Platten rock avalanche encompassed a source volume of 11 million m(3) sliding from the northern flank of the Obersee valley on similar steeply-dipping limestone beds (bedrock forms a syncline under the valley). Debris had a maximum horizontal travel distance of 1600 m with a fahrboeschung angle of 21 degrees, and is more than 80 m thick in places. Deposits of the Platten rock avalanche are superposed atop those from the Rautispitz event at the end of the Obersee valley where they dam Lake Haslensee. Runout for both events was simulated using the dynamic analysis code DAN3D; results showed excellent match to mapped deposit extents and thickness and helped confirm the hypothesized single-event failure scenarios. Cl-36 cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of 13 deposited boulders revealed a Younger Dryas age of 12.6 +/- 1.0 Ka for the Rautispitz rock avalanche and a mid-Holocene age of 6.1 +/- 0.8 Ka for the Platten rock avalanche. A seismological trigger is proposed for the former event due to potentially correlated turbidite deposits in nearby Lake Zurich. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water from the Detroit River, which provides the largest contaminant loan into the lake, flows west-to-east through the center of the western basin. We hypothesized that body burdens of Hexagenia would reflect a gradient of decreasing contamination from west to east across the basin, and from the central axis toward shorelines. In summer 1994, we used light traps or mane use of lakeside dock lights to collect subimagos (females and males) and imagos (females)for 2 h pr sunset at three locations on the Detroit Rivet and at 22 locations throughout Lake Ei ie. Imagos were found throughout the western basin, but at only three locations in other areas of Lake Erie. Mayflies were analyzed for 59 organochlorine compounds including 42 congeners of PCBs by electron-capture detector gas chromatography. Results were analyzed using principal component analysis to reduce autocorrelations among contaminants. There was a I:I correspondence for PCB concentrations between subimago and imago stages, indicating no change in body burdens between moults. The highest contaminant burdens of adults at Monroe, Michigan (an Area of Concern) reflects local sources of contaminated sediments. There are high concentrations in mayfly body burdens at Middle Sister and East Sister islands and lower concentrations near both northern and southern shorelines of the basin. Hexagenia are confirmed as effective and efficient monitors of organochlorines.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	Ciborowski, Jan/0000-0002-6588-0366; 													0380-1330						1997	23	4					383	390		10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70920-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70920-1													WOS:000071611900001

However, it is not clear whether the absolute concentrations or, instead, rate of changes in concentrations are more suitable for such assessments. In this study, we show that temporal changes in concentrations of an element in lake water are described by a simple differential equation, assuming changes in lake volume and chemical processes are negligible. The time constants (63% response time for changes in the chemical concentration in lake water) have a wide range varying between 20 and 1,000 days for the studied volcanoes in Japan, meaning it takes a long time to assess volcanic activity based on the absolute concentration of an element. In order to assess the volcanic activity in a shorter time period, based on a time-series of lake element concentration data, we developed a numerical model to calculate temporal changes in the steady-state concentration, which is proportional to the elemental concentrations of the bulk hydrothermal fluid injected from subaqueous fumaroles and hot springs. We applied our method to Yugama crater lake at Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, Japan, and quantitatively evaluated temporal changes in the hydrothermal input from 1964 to 2020. As a result, we detected changes in the Cl concentrations of the bulk hydrothermal input that were associated with unrest including the phreatic eruption in 1976 and earthquake swarms in 1989-1992 and 2014-2020. The future concentration in the lake water can be predicted from the most recent steady-state concentrations. Comparing the predicted concentration curve with the concentration obtained from lake water samples, it is possible to quickly assess whether the concentration of the bulk hydrothermal input has increased/decreased or remained constant.

Above endeavour have been initiated by periodic monitoring of both biological and physico-chemical parameters of a freshwater lake at Sahebbundh, Purulia, West Bengal, which is located at 23 degrees 29'42" N latitude and 86 degrees 21'37"E longitude. Water of this 63-acre lake is widely used for drinking purposes during summer months. But the water body has become a target of several anthropogenic interferences like garage activities, biomedical wastes, disposed sewage, etc., which can potentially hamper the health of the freshwater lake ecosystem. In all 28 species of zooplanktons are recorded from the lake, including some which are reported to be indicator of thermal pollution. Among the heavy metals the study concentrates upon Pb2+, Cr3+ and Cd2+. A remarkable change of community dynamics of the zooplankton reflected by diversity fluctuations is observed particularly in those areas with anthropogenic activities including introduction of biomedical wastes, garage activities etc. Interestingly the toxic heavy metal is very high in those spots with direct human interferences. The level of Pb2+ is much higher in those sites in comparison to the other two heavy metals, i.e. Cr3+ and Cd2+. The Pb2+ is obviously a direct contribution from anthropogenic garage activities, which is established from our findings.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2010	7	2					83	87																WOS:000211155700013

Synoptic Meteorology Explains Temperate Forest Carbon Uptake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												While substantial attention has been paid to the effects of both global climate oscillations and local meteorological conditions on the interannual variability of ecosystem carbon exchange, the relationship between the interannual variability of synoptic meteorology and ecosystem carbon exchange has not been well studied. Here we use a clustering algorithm to identify a summertime cyclonic precipitation system northwest of the Great Lakes to determine (a) the association at a daily scale between the occurrence of this system and the local meteorology and net ecosystem exchange at three Great Lakes region forested eddy covariance sites and (b) the association between the seasonal prevalence of this system and the summertime net ecosystem exchange of these sites. We find that temperature, in addition to precipitation and cloud cover, is an important explanatory factor for the suppression of net ecosystem productivity that occurs during these cyclonic events in this region. In addition, the prevalence of this cyclonic system can explain a significant proportion of the interannual variability in summertime forest ecosystem exchange in this region. This explanatory power is not due to a simple accumulation of low-productivity days that cooccur with this meteorological event, but rather a broader association between the frequency of these events and several aspects of prevailing seasonal conditions. This work demonstrates the usefulness of conceptualizing meteorology in terms of synoptic systems for explaining the interannual variability of regional carbon fluxes. Plain Language Summary Ecosystems exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. This rate of exchange is influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. Because CO2 is a major greenhouse gas, we need to determine the association between climate and ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange in order to understand potential climate feedbacks. Here we hypothesized that continental-scale atmospheric systems would be more informative than individual local meteorological variables for explaining the variability of regional carbon exchange, because these larger-scale systems concurrently indicate the state of several meteorological variables at various timescales, producing additive or interactive effects. We identified a particular summer storm system that leads to summertime rainfall and increased temperatures over and to the northwest of the Great Lakes. We found that the occurrence of this storm system is associated with weaker ecosystem carbon uptake at forests in the Great Lakes region. The widespread increase in temperature appears to contribute to this inhibition. A dampened seasonal cycle of carbon uptake is also associated with a high frequency of occurrence of this system. This work shows that large-scale weather patterns can help us understand how the ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange responds to climate. Key Points Anomalously high temperatures, in addition to cloud cover, contribute to daily-scale suppression of net ecosystem productivity at forests in the Great Lakes region during nearby cyclonic precipitation events during the growing season Forests in the Great Lakes region experience dampened growing season net ecosystem productivity during years in which this cyclonic system occurs frequently Patterns of synoptic meteorology help inform regional net ecosystem productivity					Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008; Michalak, Anna/KBA-4622-2024	Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041; Randazzo, Nina/0000-0003-1230-3773													2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB	2020	125	2								10.1029/2019JG005476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005476													WOS:000534472900007

Ciwidey River, one of its tributaries, originates on the flanks of Patuha, a Quaternary volcano which contains an acid (pH < 1) crater lake having high contents of sulphur and chlorine, and where various other hydrothermal manifestations are active, We present the results of a geochemical study carried out in 1995-1996 to assess the impact of volcanogenic pollution along this river, whose natural flow is disturbed by the use of water for irrigation and other purposes. Concentrations of dissolved major and trace elements in the Ciwidey River show peak levels associated with the influx of acid streams, Downstream decreasing trends are attributable to dilution and other attenuation processes commonly observed in acid mine drainage. The main contaminating streams originate from two different sources: (1) a flank spring producing water which is suspected to contain a portion of leaking acid lake water; and (2) artificial sulphur-mud deposits which are the remains of sulphur production from crater-lake sediments that were exploited in the first half of this century. Fluctuations in pH and dissolved metals observed along the river during repeated sampling campaigns are correlated with seasonal successions of wet and dry periods, but the interference in the drainage pattern has modified the original natural variations. The river water shows lowest pH values and remains acid along the greatest distance during the rainy season. Downstream decreases in acidity, which are largely induced by dilution with neutral water, determine to a significant extent whether potentially harmful elements remain dissolved or are removed by precipitation or sorption onto solid phases. The seasonal variability in discharges and acid input, combined with human interference in the river flow thus creates highly dynamic conditions for mobilisation and fixation of the volcanogenic pollutants, Among the elements studied, aluminium, arsenic, boron, iron and manganese reach concentrations which deserve attention in view of the potential consequences for the human environment. In general, the volcanogenic pollutants return to baseline levels before the confluence with the Citarum River at some 30 km from the focal point of the acid discharges. It is expected that only the most conservative dissolved elements could cause detectable changes resulting from the influx of the Ciwidey River water. However, ephemeral peak discharges cannot be excluded, and may have an impact which remained unnoticed during our sampling campaigns. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	SPENCER, DF				SPENCER, DF			ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF TRIPLOID GRASS CARP ON SAGO PONDWEED IN THE BYRNES CANAL - IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IRRIGATION SYSTEMS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This paper describes a program which simulates growth of the aquatic plant, Potamogeton pectinatus L. (sago pondweed), and plant consumption by the herbivorous fish, Ctenopharyngodon idella Val (triploid grass carp), under environmental conditions characteristic of a northern California irrigation system. In the program, plant growth is driven by temperature and light intensity, and grass carp feeding and growth by water temperature. The program uses data on these variables collected from the Byrnes Canal using data loggers which recorded temperature and light at 0.5-h intervals on 115 days during the summer of 1989. Less extensive data sets from two other canals were used to construct realistic simulation scenarios for canals with warmer or cooler water temperatures. The program provided reasonable predictions of plant growth, plant consumption by the fish, and fish growth. Simulations showed that using triploid grass carp in northern California irrigation systems that typically have cool water temperatures (12 to 24-degrees-C) would require more fish (50 or 250 kg vegetated ha 1 depending on the management objectives) than previous simulations for lakes in the U.S. would suggest. Evaluation of two management strategies indicated that stocking grass carp at 50 kg vegetated ha-1 in the first year, and retrieving and releasing them in subsequent years would be economically competitive with current management practices.																			0304-3800					APR	1994	72	3-4					187	204		10.1016/0304-3800(94)90083-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)90083-3													WOS:A1994NH37700003

Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv is a large and shallow eutrophic lake where water quality measurements have been carried out for a long time. The monthly characteristics of DOC and CDOM in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv and its input/output rivers were traced in 5-years observations. We attempted to link the hydro-morphological indices as lake area (A), water level (WL) and volume variations (Qc) with lake DOC fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationships to improve understanding of carbon fluxes in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake, as well as of the possibility to estimate DOC fluxes by CDOM via remote sensing. The research questions were: how the properties and quantity of DOC, its fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationship in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake are responding to 1) variable proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous processes and 2) changing hydrological conditions. The increased lake volume variation in spring caused the higher level of CDOM, signifying the terrestrial (allochthonous) DOC (DOCAlloch) domination in Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv. The proportion of DOCAlloch increased together with increasing WL, A and CDOM concentration. Although the generally high proportion of DOCAlloch in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv, the autochthonous DOC determines the water color (CDOM/DOC) in this highly productive ecosystem with short residence time (280-365 days). Our study on DOC flux revealed that the internal carbon sources, driven by hydrological factors, contribute significantly to the role of large and shallow lakes in global carbon cycling. The further development of water color remote sensing could provide novel directions for understanding the feedbacks of lake DOC flux and changing hydrology.

Using canonical redundancy analysis and an extension of this method to partial out the variance into spatial and environmental components, we found that most of the explained fraction of potential microbial activities (70-90%) was accounted for by the significant environmental variables (NH4+, particulate carbon, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved O-2, depth, and temperature) and not much by the spatial polynomial trend surface. We found significant path coefficients (0.53 and 0.57 in 1990 and 1991) between CO, production and potential denitrification, which suggests that denitrifiers are dependent upon a heterotrophic bacterial population for directly assimilable carbon sources. We also found significant path coefficients between particulate carbon and both CH4 production (0.67 and 0.33) and CO2 production (0. 50 and 0.38), while significant path coefficients were also found between dissolved organic carbon and CO2 production (0.34 and 0.47). We conclude that beside well-known abiotic factors such as O-2, NO3- and organic carbon, a biotic factor involved in carbon metabolism may bk important in explaining the spatial variation of denitrification capacity in the sediment of Hamilton Harbour.

Increased phytoplankton levels are a response to increasing nitrate levels in groundwater and groundwater-fed streams entering the lake. Urine from grazing animals is the largest, manageable, contributor to ground water nitrates. As means of reducing nitrate emissions, changed management on, and changed use of, farmland are options explored in two trials reported here. Production and nitrogen (N) leaching from annual and perennial crops have been measured over 2 years. Similar measurements were made in a cattle grazing trial comparing all year grazing (AYG), no winter grazing (NWG) and no grazing (NG - baleage). Lucerne, pasture, triticale+annual ryegrass and forage maize+annual ryegrass yields were variable between years and lower than expected. Nitrate leaching from perennial crops was lower than from annual crops (I I 28 v 50-223 kg N0(3)-N ha(-1)). N utilisation was similar in NWG and AYG (177 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) but N03-N leaching losses in AYG were significantly greater than those in NWG and NG (16.6, 5.6, 2.4 kg N0(3)-N ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively). Management options incorporating the low nitrate emission systems are being evaluated for agricultural and economic feasibility and, using selected scenarios, will be extrapolated across the farmed landscape in the Taupo Catchment to predict potential nitrate leaching reductions.																					90-76998-68-X				2005							49	56																WOS:000231877500004

A mid to late Holocene chironomid-inferred temperature record from northwest Ireland	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This study provides the first mid to late Holocene chironomid-inferred temperature (C-IT) model for northwest Ireland, creating a valuable climatic context for the development of Irish society during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Using a lake sediment core from an isolated catchment, Lough Meenachrinna in northwest Ireland, a multi proxy approach of chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) subfossils, sediment geochemistry (delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N) and pollen analysis was used to assess any potential limnological impact from prehistoric human activity in the region and provide a quantitative summer temperature estimate for the late Mesolithic to the Iron Age (7050-2050 cal yr BP). The pollen record provides a local signal of human activity, showing low levels of pastoral indicators in the early Neolithic, with increased evidence for pastoral and arable farming during the Bronze Age and in particular the Iron Age. Human activity does not appear to be a driving force in lake system change at Lough Meenachrinna, as peaks in farming indicators (e.g. pastoral pollen indicators and increased delta N-15 values) were not concurrent with major fluctuations in the chironomid assemblages. C-ITs provide evidence of multiple fluctuations in temperature during the mid to late Holocene with a cold phase during the late Mesolithic (6800-5890 cal yr BP), followed by a warming period during the early Neolithic (5890-5570 cal yr BP). C-ITs reflect a relatively warm climate during the middle Neolithic, with a substantial warming from the late Neolithic into the early Bronze Age (4630-3810 cal yr BP). C-ITs show a general cooling trend from the Bronze Age into the Iron Age, with a cold event occurring at 3340 cal yr BP during the middle Bronze Age and second cold event at 2430 cal yr BP during the Iron Age. The multi-proxy approach has proven an effective strategy for untangling human and climate influences on the chironomid record, and is recommended as a methodological approach in future Holocene climatic reconstructions where prehistoric human influence is a factor.					; Taylor, Karen/LTC-8121-2024	Molloy, Karen/0000-0002-4768-9197; Taylor, Karen/0000-0003-4376-8610; Potito, Aaron/0000-0003-0194-9552													0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 15	2018	505						274	286		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.06.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.06.006													WOS:000438477700023
J	Effler, SW; Brooks, CM				Effler, SW; Brooks, CM			Dry weight deposition in polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Short and long-term trends in dry weight deposition rates are documented for polluted Onondaga Lake, NY, based on analyses of sediment trap collections made below the epilimnion at a single deep-water location in ten years over the 1980-1992 period using cylindrical traps. Additionally, comparisons of dry weight rates obtained with two different diameter (4.0 and 7.6 cm) traps of the same aspect ratio (6), at four different depths below the epilimnion, and from the lake's two basins, in 1993, are presented to establish the representativeness of the long-term data. The near equivalence of fluxes determined with the different size traps and cumulative deposition rates measured over the range of deployment depths, and the minor differences in flux observed for the two basins, supports the representativeness of long-term data in quantifying deposition rates for the pelagic zone of the lake. Short-term variations in downward flux have been common in the lake over the period of monitoring. The summer-average dry weight deposition rate decreased systematically (by about 45%) following the closure (in 1986) of a soda ash facility that caused enhanced rates of calcium carbonate deposition; from an average of 23.2 to 12.8 g m(-2) d(-1). These dry weight deposition rates are high compared to values reported in the literature for other lakes, and are responsible for the lake's high rate of net sedimentation.																			0049-6979					APR	1998	103	1-4					389	404		10.1023/A:1004916003946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004916003946													WOS:000072601600023

Hence, identifying the plausible locale for collecting the sediment core is cumbersome. The present research proposes a methodological approach for precisely identifying the repositories. The Cauvery Delta, the largest sediment deposit on Tamil Nadu's eastern coast, is chosen for the study. The study's methodology is structured into: (1) reconstructing a catalogue of significant flood events using documentary records; (2) mapping fluvial geomorphic landforms using satellite images; (3) spatially correlating the records obtained from documentary sources with landforms, and (4) identifying flood geomorphic landforms (FGL) and demarcating promising prospective locales for future chronological studies. It has been observed that the Cauvery River has experienced recurrent instances of flooding throughout the past 8000 years. The FGL mapped using digitally processed satellite images displayed 17 types of landforms. Subsequently, the FGL are precisely identified by spatially integrating documentary data with landforms. Braided bar, channel bar, lateral bar, channel islands, natural levees, paleochannels, older flood plains, point bars, oxbow lakes, and water bodies are the most promising FGL for paleoflood research.

Evolution of a paleolake on Russian Island (Sea of Japan) in middle-late Holocene: record of sea-level oscillations, extreme storms and tsunami	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN THE HOLOCENE	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				5th International Conference on Ecosystem Dynamics in the Holocene	NOV 11-15, 2019	Moscow, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Russian Acad Sci, Geol Inst, Russian Acad Sci, A N Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Int Geog Union, Environm Evolut Commiss				The diatom algae from sediments of a paleolake serve as records of changes to environments over the last 7500 cal yr. The lagoon lake formed when the sea level approximately corresponded to the present-day position. Evolution of the paleolake was controlled by sea-level oscillations and humidity changes. Eight stages have been distinguished. During a dry episode in 7330-7090 cal yr BP the lake size decreased. The salinity reached maximal values at the Holocene transgression peak. Three stages of a higher salinity are recognized (6750-6500, 6080-5830, 5420-5090 cal yr BP). A severe flood occurred in 6080-6000 cal yr BP. The brackish-water lake existed in similar to 5090 cal yr BP and the freshwater lake in similar to 4090 cal yr BP. A prolonged phase of decreasing humidity, associated with a weakening of summer monsoons, led to a drop in sedimentation rates in similar to 3510 cal yr BP. Peat accumulation started at the Little Ice Age. The lake was transformed into a swamp during drop in precipitations in similar to 270 cal yr BP. Presence of marine diatoms typical in bay and deepwater forms are evidence of influence of extreme storms and tsunami. The age of the paleotsunami coincides well with the regional data.

Phytoplankton ecology in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario: Spatial distribution, dynamics and heterogeneity	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Great Lakes of the World (GLOW) Conference on Advancing the Ecosystem Approach - Good Governance for Adaptation and Rehabilitation	MAR 24-26, 2015	Mangochi, MALAWI					The Bay of Quinte, a large riverine embayment located on the northeastern shores of Lake Ontario, has a long history of cultural eutrophication. While the Bay has been the subject of an extensive research and monitoring program that began in 1972, phytoplankton assessments have been limited to 2-3 index stations with few exceptions. Our study consisted of three separate surveys conducted during the summer of 2010 (June, August, September) at 12 sites spread evenly throughout the Bay. Among the major findings were that conditions in the Bay ranged from oligo- to mesotrophic in June, but were primarily eutrophic in August and September with algal blooms observed at 50-75% of the sites; the spatial extent limited only by incursions of oligotrophic water from Lake Ontario. Furthermore, primary productivity in the Bay (e.g. 43.3-109.6mg C m(-3) h(-1) in September) was among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, indicative of a phytoplankton community very well adapted to its environment. We also found that the Bay of Quinte supported a diverse algal flora containing 140 unique species in June, 209 in August and 169 in September which we attribute to the variable physical environment. Of the 35 phytoplankton samples assessed, Diatomeae were the most prevalent taxa in 16 of those assemblages followed by Cyanophyta (including many toxigenic species) in 12. The relative importance of diatoms are often overlooked in studies of eutrophication yet two species in particular, Aulacoseira granulata and A. ambigua, were major contributors to both the algal standing crop and the elevated rates of primary production. We recommend that future research be directed at understanding the ecology, physiology and dynamics of these filamentous diatoms as well as their associations with filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria.

In some areas, rocks from the Trinity Group and the Gustav Group outcrop. Syngenetic cryounits with an active layer development of 0.8 m and ice content ranging from 6% to 15%, increasing with depth, have been detected. Epigenetic units develop an active layer of up to 1.25 m (6-16% ice content), with similar depth values. Along the coastal zone, cryopeg reaches nearly 8 m in depth, alternating between ice, fresh water and saline water. The low and high plains exhibit extensive areas of open talik. In the low plain, a suprapermafrost summer aquifer with a thickness of 1.25-1.50 m develops. Glacial-fed creeks discharge 98% of the water input, while snow-fed creeks contribute only 0.04 Hm3/month. The ponds are divided into those fed by glaciers (linked to open talik) and those fed by precipitation (linked to closed talik). Creeks have an average salinity of 198 mg/l, lakes 190 mg/l and groundwater 223 mg/l. This study focuses on the area of the new Petrel Base, designed to enhance Argentine logistics.

When Ernest Beaux set a goal of creating the perfume with the smelt of the north lakes in summer ("Chanel No 5"), actually he introduced the resource connected with a sense of smell in the art system. Beaux obtained the aroma that used olfactory means and arose the image with no connection with the essence of the odorous substance. In considering odorous and mental issues as a part of the art system, interpretation of both modern perfume compositions and fragrance is logical from the artistic and aesthetic standpoints; it is logical in the aesthetic aspects because many symbols in the culture have always had connections not just with visual, audio elements but also odorous ones. The case in question is fragrance used in rituals with their symbolic interpretation, which is often simultaneous with audio creativity. It is obvious when comparing odorous and mental, audio elements in orthodox cult, in which everything is soaked with fragrance, including walls, icons, priests' garment. It sorts of fill psalmody and prayers, corrects all artistic intensions of cult creativity by its means. Particularly it is felt in the ritual of cense and interpreted by theologians.																					978-5-906709-86-8				2017							256	262																WOS:000435295400025
J	Demlie, M; Ayenew, T; Wohnlich, S				Demlie, Molla; Ayenew, Tenalem; Wohnlich, Stefan			Comprehensive hydrological and hydrogeological study of topographically closed lakes in highland Ethiopia: The case of Hayq and Ardibo	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A comprehensive conventional hydrological and hydrogeological study was conducted in two topographically closed crater takes in the northeastern highlands of Ethiopia. Particular emphasis is given to the estimation of the water balance and assessment of groundwater and surface water interactions. The detailed bathymetric map of the takes has also been established for the first time. The result revealed the importance of both groundwater and surface water components in the water balance of the takes. Field hydrogeological observations and the conventional water balance indicate outflow and inflow of groundwater from both Lakes. The takes leak groundwater through large faults, which also control the occurrence and distribution of springs. The leakage of the takes through faults is independently validated by hydrochemical analysis; indicating lower ionic concentration and freshness of both takes in contrast with closed terminal takes, which are commonly characterized by higher salinity. Limited environmental isotopes together with major ion analysis revealed that shallow fresh groundwater recharged from highland rainfall is one of the main driving forces of the hydrology of the takes and their catchments. There is no indication of deep groundwater with high ionic concentration and residence time that feeds the takes. From erratic take level record and bathymetric survey, it was found that take Hayq has declined in level over the last 60 years. But, recently due to human influences (return flow from irrigation), the Level has shown slight rise at the expense of the leaking take Ardibo located at relatively higher topographic position. These recent anthropogenic influences demand careful assessment of the complex nature of the hydrology and the water balance. In this regard, this study is believed to have laid the foundation for future detailed work that may help for sustainable water management practise. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shallow top soil removal (TSR) up to 40 cm was applied to remove the upper degraded peat layer in order to eliminate accumulated nutrients and unwanted seed banks as well as generating material for infilling drain ditchesand building dams. This measure has well known positive effects on species development, but very little was known about the phosphorus (P) status in the newly exposed peat soils and porewater. Therefore, we investigated (i) the P mobilisation potential of surface peat soils, (ii) net P release rates in intact soil cores with different degree of peat decomposition, and (iii) P concentrations in porewater of rewetted fen areas with TSR compared to areas without removal and refilled drain ditches. We highlighted that TSR strongly reduced the P mobilisation potential and thereby also the concentration of dissolved P in the porewater at the peat surface. Furthermore, we found low net P release rates close to 0 mg P m(-2) d(-1)( median, n = 9) in the cut-over areas with less degraded peat similar to those documented for natural fens. Despite of high P concentrations up to 2.6 mg L-1 in rewetted areas without TSR (about 50% of total peatland area) there was no evidence of elevated P export to other low-nutrient areas of the fen or in aclose-by lake due to high P retention capacity of the iron-rich degraded peat (molar Fe: P ratios >10). It can be concluded that TSR is a suitable measure to recover nutrient poor conditions in rewetted fens in a relatively short time frame instead of decades to centuries compared to rewetting measures without TSR. This measure is highly recommended if degraded peatlands are characterised by a low P retention capacity or low molar Fe/P ratios in degraded peat (<10) respectively and above all if downstream areas include nutrient-poor systems highly sensitive regarding slightly increased P inputs.

Information on the specific locations and intensity of use can provide an important "early warning" of locations of potential visitor resource impact and of times and places where visitor density is suggestive of crowding and other experience issues. Past studies have traditionally used techniques such as automated visitor counters, observational methodologies, and survey techniques to gain an understanding of the spatial component of visitor use behavior and of visitor use intensity. However, these methods have various limitations including logistical considerations and the reliability and accuracy of the techniques. This research reports on recent methodological advances in three studies where global positioning system (GPS) tracking methodologies was used to determine the locations and densities of visitor use along trail corridors. GPS-based methods were used in the Tuolumne Meadows trail system of Yosemite National Park to understand visitor use at this popular hiking destination, within the Bear Lake Corridor of Rocky Mountain National Park to examine the spatial patterns of visitor use, and in the Teton Range to measure the frequency, timing, and intensity of winter backcountry recreation. Findings from these studies suggest that GPS tracking methodology holds significant promise. GPS-based methods can be used to gather both spatial and temporal information about visitors in a variety of protected area management situations. The data resulting from GPS strategies are ample, detailed, and more accurate spatially than data collected using traditional methodologies. GPS tracking methodology has the potential to be combined with other data sources, such as visitor surveys and recreation ecology assessments, to provide an important use-related context to these approaches. Overall, GPS tracking can be used to gain information vital to the understanding of several contemporary issues in protected area management such as visitor experience and natural resource impacts, visitor-wildlife concerns, and visitor soundscape experiences.																			0735-1968	2160-6862				FAL	2010	28	3					42	60																WOS:000442880300003

Tabular lavas and subordinate sills, in a sequence up to 2400 m thick, mainly comprise porphyritic basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite, and are locally interbedded with thin units of volcaniclastic sandstone and pyroclastic rocks; these are overlain by 800 m of acid andesitic pyroclastic rocks. The distribution and form of the lava/sill facies association are consistent with emplacement as a lava plateau sequence, remarkably similar to the Birker Fell Formation, the lower part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group in the central Lake District. The Eycott Volcanic Group rocks are geochemically coherent with characteristics transitional between medium-K, continental-margin tholeiitic, and calc-alkaline andesite suites. Rocks within the suite can be linked by fractionation of an assemblage of plagioclase, pyroxene, Fe-Ti oxide and apatite. A prominent compositional gap between about 58 and 65% SiO2 is attributed to the rapid precipitation and segregation of Fe-Ti oxide. Incompatible element concentrations in the mafic members suggest that magmas were derived possibly from a subcontinental lithosphere source, similar to that of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. The geochemical differences between these two suites arose through the incorporation of different amounts of the subduction component and different fractionation histories.

High-resolution grain size, organic carbon and carbonates, as well as geochemical and magnetic analyses, were conducted on a sediment core retrieved from the basin to infer changes in sediment provenance in association with climate-induced variations in Nile River discharge during the Holocene. A high Si/Al ratio in the coarse sediment with weak magnetic properties prior to ca. 9.7 cal ka BP indicated prevalent aeolian activities in the lake basin, revealing no Nile discharge inputs and thus a dry Nile. Initial high values of the mobile elements (CaO, MgO and Sr) after ca. 9.7 cal ka BP with well-sorted finer sediment marked the establishment of a flow connection between the basin and the Nile since then. This establishment was followed by a durative hydrological connection to the Nile until ca. 5.0 cal ka BP inferred from high organic matter and stable magnetic and geochemical properties of the finer sediment, implying a humid climate phase of the Nile between ca. 9.7-5.0 cal ka BP. Afterwards, an increasing Ti/Al ratio and magnetism of the sediment indicated a brief change in sediment provenance, as material from the volcanic Ethiopian Uplands carried by the Blue Nile and the Atbara became dominant. A drying climate prevailed in the Nile Basin after ca. 5.0 cal ka BP. Although the Ti/Al ratio and sediment magnetic properties still showed a prominent sediment contribution from the volcanic Ethiopian Uplands, the natural discharge from the river Nile to the Faiyum Basin was weakened, especially when increasing water extraction by humans occurred after ca. 4.0 cal ka BP. The sediment provenance pattern of the Faiyum Basin was substantially influenced by climate-induced variations of the Nile discharge in response to the advance/retreat of the African Summer Monsoon (ASM) driven by the northward/southward migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Nitrogen Deposition Effects on Diatom Communities in Lakes from Three National Parks in Washington State	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The goal of this study was to document if lakes in National Parks in Washington have exceeded critical levels of nitrogen (N) deposition, as observed in other Western States. We measured atmospheric N deposition, lake water quality, and sediment diatoms at our study lakes. Water chemistry showed that our study lakes were ultra-oligotrophic with ammonia and nitrate concentrations often at or below detection limits with low specific conductance (<100 mu S/cm), and acid neutralizing capacities (<400 mu eq/L). Rates of summer bulk inorganic N deposition at all our sites ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and were variable both within and across the parks. Diatom assemblages in a single sediment core from Hoh Lake (Olympic National Park) displayed a shift to increased relative abundances of Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria tenera beginning in the 1969-1975 timeframe, whereas these species were not found at the remaining (nine) sites. These diatom species are known to be indicative of N enrichment and were used to determine an empirical critical load of N deposition, or threshold level, where changes in diatom communities were observed at Hoh Lake. However, N deposition at the remaining nine lakes does not seem to exceed a critical load at this time. At Milk Lake, also in Olympic National Park, there was some evidence that climate change might be altering diatom communities, but more research is needed to confirm this. We used modeled precipitation for Hoh Lake and annual inorganic N concentrations from a nearby National Atmospheric Deposition Program station, to calculate elevation-corrected N deposition for 19802009 at Hoh Lake. An exponential fit to this data was hindcasted to the 1969-1975 time period, and we estimate a critical load of 1.0 to 1.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for wet deposition for this lake.					; Swarzenski, Peter/AAD-8562-2022	Sheibley, Richard/0000-0003-1627-8536; Moran, Patrick/0000-0002-2002-3539; Swarzenski, Peter/0000-0003-0116-0578; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2014	225	2							1857	10.1007/s11270-013-1857-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1857-x								24578586					WOS:000331828400029

Reconciling discrepant chronologies for the geomagnetic excursion in the Mono Basin, California: Insights from new 40Ar/39Ar dating experiments and a revised relative paleointensity correlation	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Lacustrine sediments of the Wilson Creek Formation in the Mono Basin, California, record a paleomagnetic field excursion constrained by C-14 and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to have occurred within the last 50 ka. However, C-14 and 40Ar/39Ar ages are discordant, making it difficult to distinguish which of two possible excursions during this period, the Mono Lake or Laschamp, is recorded in the Mono Basin. New 40Ar/39Ar age determinations from sanidine, as well as the first biotite and obsidian ages, for three of the nineteen rhyolitic ashes intercalated with these sediments are presented and compared to previous C-14 and 40Ar/39Ar data sets. Although the sanidine ages of the three ashes are stratigraphically consistent with each other and previously determined 40Ar/39Ar ages for other ashes in the Wilson Creek Formation, each is significantly older than C-14 ages obtained from stratigraphically equivalent beds, relative paleointensity field correlations, oxygen isotope records, and glacial histories. These data indicate an absence of juvenile, eruptive crystals and most likely reflect the incorporation of crystals from older volcanic centers or underlying sediment. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of all available geochronologic data for the section exposed at Wilson Creek to arrive at an internally consistent set of age constraints. Using these constraints we propose two new relative paleointensity correlations for the section, both of which indicate that the excursion recorded in the Mono Basin occurred at similar to 30-34 ka on the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core time scale.

J	Lap, BQ; Mori, K				Lap, Bui Quoc; Mori, Ken			A two-dimensional numerical model of wind-induced flow and water quality in closed water bodies	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												In closed water bodies, such as reservoirs and lakes, where the exchange with external waters is usually small, the wind-induced flow significantly affects their water quality by mixing the surface waters and transfering heat down through the water column. However, the circulation caused by wind acting on the water surface can be influenced by the excessive growth of aquatic plants in summer, which may make their water quality to become worse. Therefore, understanding the response of the closed water bodies to winds acting on the water surface is of great significance in examining and maintaining their water quality in good condition. With that significance, this research has been done to build a two-dimensional, unsteady, laterally averaged model for simulating the circulation and water quality in closed water bodies. To verify the model, the Tabiishidani reservoir located in Sasaguri town, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, was chosen as a case study. To illustrate the methodology of the research, water temperature of the reservoir was chosen to calibrate the model. After calibration, the model was applied to simulate water temperature in the Tabiishidani reservoir under different patterns of meteorology. The results of simulation clarified the change in water temperature distribution along the depth of the reservoir under the different patterns of meteorology. This research shows that the model can be a suitable tool for simulating the circulation and water temperature in closed water bodies. Moreover, the model can be extended to simulate the circulation and any variable of water quality in closed water bodies with the coverage of aquatic plants on the water surface.

J	Greenbery, CH				Greenbery, CH			Vegetation recovery and stand structure following a prescribed stand-replacement burn in sand pine scrub	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Vegetation and stand structure of sand pine scrub in central Florida, USA, were measured before a prescribed stand-replacement burn and for > 8 y afterward. Herbaceous species richness peaked within 16 months postburn, then gradually declined, although significant differences were detected only between 16 months and > 8 y postburn. Twenty-two plant species were detected after the burn that were not recorded prior to the burn. Woody plant species richness recovered to preburn levels within 5 months. Myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia Willd.), the dominant species, regained its preburn cover within 16 months and preburn height within 40 months. Scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia Swingle ex Nash) regained its preburn cover and height within 5 months. After > 8 y sand pine (Pinus clausa clausa [Chapm. Ex Engelm.] Vasey ex Sarg.) had regained 29% cover and 2.3 in height. Litter layer thickness was reduced by the fire but was subsequently stable. Bare ground increased postburn but was similar to preburn levels within 64 months. Light at breast height peaked at 28-64 months postburn, and light at ground level increased postburn and remained high. Coarse woody debris cover and diameter increased beginning 28 months postburn as snags fell. Under the right conditions, prescribed stand-replacement fire can be used in sand pine scrub to enhance species richness, temporarily increase cover and reproduction by some endemic plant species, and temporarily eliminate the sand pine canopy to restore a historically common stand structure.																			0885-8608					APR	2003	23	2					141	151																WOS:000182267800006

Influence of water temperature on rainbow smelt spawning and early life history dynamics in St. Martin Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rainbow smelt are an important prey species for native and introduced salmonines in the Great Lakes. In Lake Huron, rainbow smelt populations are characterized by variable recruitment and year-class strength. To understand the influence of water temperature on reproduction, growth, and survival during larval-fish stages, we sampled spawning tributaries and larval-fish habitats during 2008 and 2009 in St. Martin Bay, Lake Huron. Spawning by rainbow smelt occurred primarily when stream temperatures were between 3 and 10 C, which resulted in a 7-10-day spawning period during 2008, and a 15-20-day spawning period during 2009. Regardless of these differences in spawning temperatures and duration, peak larval-fish densities during 2008 were double those observed during 2009. Length-frequency analysis of larval-fish populations during both years revealed stream-hatched fish during May and a later emergence of larval rainbow smelt during summer, presumably originating from lake spawning. Warmer bay water temperatures led to earlier emergence of lake-spawned rainbow smelt larvae during 2009. Stream-hatched fish larvae experienced large-scale mortality during May 2008 resulting in a bay population consisting primarily of lake-spawned rainbow smelt larvae, but during 2009 both stream- and lake-hatched cohorts experienced higher survival concomitant with significantly higher mean population growth rates. Higher larval-fish growth rates during 2009 appeared to be density-dependent and facilitated by warmer water temperatures during late June and cooler water temperatures during July. Temperature-mediated differences in annual growth rates and irregular contributions from stream- and lake-hatched fish larvae are important factors affecting survival and abundance of young-of-the-year rainbow smelt in Lake Huron.

During 4 days, A. ovalisporum showed a marked diet periodicity in buoyancy: the proportion of floating filaments fluctuated between 76-84% from midday to evening and 94-98% at the end of the night, in both surface and bottom samples. Buoyant filaments were present throughout the water column, presumably due to wind-driven vertical mixing Aphanizomenon filaments collected from the reservoir were maintained under mean photon irradiances of 15 (LL), 150 (ML) and I 100 (HL),mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in a computer-controlled set-up, which simulated the diet light changes at different depths in the reservoir. In the LL cultures, filament buoyancy showed no diel fluctuation patterns during the 4 days of incubation, but ML and HL cultures showed regular diet changes, with a higher proportion of filaments floating at the end of the night than during midday-evening. There was no evidence for either turgor-driven collapse of gas vesicles or dilution of gas vesicles by cell growth by any of the treatments. Gas vesicles of A. ovalisporum had a relatively low mean critical pressure (p(c) of 0.57 MPa), but the daytime rise in turgor pressure was too small to cause gas vesicle collapse. The observed diet buoyancy changes may be explained by accumulation of carbohydrate ballast during the day and decrease during the night.																			0142-7873					JUL	2001	23	7					753	763		10.1093/plankt/23.7.753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.7.753													WOS:000171693300008

Here we present a comprehensive review of vessel impacts to cetacean behavior in Australian waters (2003-2015), finding inadequate protections to be in place. The majority of these studies found trends of decreased animal travel and resting behavioral states as well as low compliance to regulations, and they recommended further regulatory action such as greater enforcement or monitoring, or passive management strategies. As a case study, we conducted the first field assessment of vessel compliance with the Wildlife (Marine Mammal) Regulations 2009 in Gippsland Lakes, Australia, and provide the first assessment of the endangered Gippsland Lakes Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis) population's behavioral ecology. Dolphin behavior and vessel regulation compliance data were collected during boat-based surveys of Gippsland Lakes from July 2017 to January 2018, with a total of 22 dolphin group sightings resulting in 477 five-minute point samples. 77% of dolphin sightings involved vessel interactions (within 400 m), and 56 regulation breaches were observed. These breaches were most severe in summer (mean = 4.54 breaches/hour). Vessels were found to alter dolphin behavior before, during, and after interactions and regulation breaches, including increased mating (mate guarding) and milling behavioral states, and increased 'fish catch', 'high leap' and 'tail slap' behavioral events. These behavioral changes may indicate masking of the dolphins' acoustic communication, disturbance of prey, increased dolphin transition behaviors, and/or induced stress and changes to group structure (including increased mate guarding). While our results provide evidence of short-term altered behavior, the potential for long-term effects on population dynamics for this threatened species is high. In the context of reported inadequate cetacean protection Australia-wide, our management recommendations include greater monitoring and enforcement, and the utilisation of adaptive management.					; Shimeta, Jeff/AAR-9642-2021	Robb, Kate/0000-0002-7038-3612; Shimeta, Jeff/0000-0002-7003-7832; Puszka, Helena/0000-0002-7448-6141													1932-6203					JAN 19	2021	16	1							e0243353	10.1371/journal.pone.0243353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243353								33465088					WOS:000611969200045
J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Simulated climate change effects on dissolved oxygen characteristics in ice-covered lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A deterministic, one-dimensional model is presented which simulates daily dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles and associated water temperatures, ice covers and snow covers for dimictic and polymictic lakes of the temperate zone. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area (A(S)), maximum depth (H-MAX), and Secchi depth as a measure of light attenuation and trophic state. The model is driven by daily weather data and operates year-round over multiple years. The model has been validated with extensive data (5976 points). Standard error between simulated and measured dissolved oxygen is 1.9 mg/l. The model is applied to simulate effects of climate change on dissolved oxygen characteristics of 27 lake classes in Minnesota. The projected climate changes due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 are obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center Global Circulation Model (CCC GCM). Climate change delays the ice formation and shortens the ice cover period. Winter anoxia, even in shallow lakes, therefore disappears under a projected 2 x CO2 climate condition. This eliminates winterkill in these lakes. Herein, the simulated DO characteristics have been plotted and interpolated graphically in a coordinate system with a lake geometry ratio (A(S)(0.25)/H-MAX) On one axis and Secchi depth on the other. The lake geometry ratio expresses a lake's susceptibility to stratification. To illustrate the effect of projected climate change on DO characteristics, separate graphs are presented for values simulated with inputs of past climate conditions (1961-79) and with a projected 2 x CO2 climate scenario.

J	PECHAR, L				PECHAR, L			WATER BLOOMS OF APHANIZOMENON-FLOS-AQUAE AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF FISH POND POPULATIONS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The study summarizes data on the occurrence of a typical temperate-zone water bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae RALFS ex BORN et FLAH. in ponds of the Blatna district in the years 1954-1982 and the results of field observations and experiments between 1983 and 1985. In the 1950's and 1960's the water bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae var. flos-aquae forming up to 20 mm long colonies (flakes), accompanied by large individuals of Daphnia, was the most common type of summer plankton in the fish ponds of Czechoslovakia. During the 1970's a conspicuous reduction in the occurrence of this type of water bloom was observed. At present the occurrence of the typical variety flos-aquae can be considered to be a rare phenomenon. Since the early 1980's A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii ELENK. with small flakes, only 0.1 to 0.3 mm long on the average, has been present more frequently. The transition from var.flos-aquae to var. klebahnii is related to changes in fish pond management, which included an increase in the fish stock and a decrease in the fertilization of the ponds. The present study shows a strong ecophysiological differentiation of the investigated varieties and the mechanism of the effect of the fish pond management on the occurrence of two different types of Aphanizomenon blooms.																			0003-9136					AUG	1992		3		90			339	418																WOS:A1992JR16200003

Changes in Climatic Variables and Their Effect on Wheat Water Requirement in Urmia Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Climate change and low water use efficiency are the main reasons for reducing the water entering the Urmia Lake. Therefore, water use management via irrigation scheduling can be an effective strategy to restore this lake. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of climatic variables on water requirements, identify water-sensitive growth stages, and prepare irrigation scheduling guidelines for wheat, which is one of the main crops in the studied region. For this purpose, crop Evapotranspiration (ETc) and Net Irrigation Requirement (NIR) of wheat growth stages were estimated by computing the daily soil water balance of the root zone for a period of 32 years (1985-1986 to 2016-2017). Dividing wheat growth period into nine phenological stages was performed using Growing Degree Days (GDDs) and Zadoks scale. These stages included intervals of [Sowing-Emergence (StE)], [Emergence-Trifoliate (EtT)], [Trifoliate-Double ridge (TtD)], [Double ridge-Jointing (DtJ)], [Jointing-Booting (JtB)], [Booting-Heading (BtH)], [Heading-Anthesis (HtA)], [Anthesis-Maturity (AtM)] and [Maturity-Harvesting (MtHa)], whose mean ETe was estimated to be 2.30, 1.33, 1.03, 3.63, 4.69, 5.13, 6.53, 7.09 and 1.35 mm d(-1), respectively. The mean ETC, Effective Precipitation (Eff. P) and NIR of wheat during its growth period were estimated to be 774, 349, and 425 mm, respectively. Results showed that wheat sensitivity to water stress is high from booting to maturity, is low from sowing to double ridge and from maturity to harvesting, and is moderate in other stages. Therefore, increasing the irrigation interval in the first three stages of growth and eliminating the end-stage irrigation are recommended for water saving.

Cogenetic late Pleistocene rhyolite and cumulate diorites from Augustine Volcano revealed by SIMS 238U-230Th dating of zircon, and implications for silicic magma generation by extraction from mush	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Augustine Volcano, a frequently active andesitic island stratocone, erupted a late Pleistocene rhyolite pumice fall that is temporally linked through zircon geochronology to cumulate dioritic blocks brought to the surface in Augustine's 2006 eruption. Zircon from the rhyolite yield a U-238-Th-230 age of approximate to 25 ka for their unpolished rims, and their interiors yield a bimodal age populations at approximate to 26 ka and a minority at approximate to 41 ka. Zircon from dioritic blocks, ripped from Augustine's shallow magmatic plumbing system and ejected during the 2006 eruption, have interiors defining a approximate to 26 ka age population that is indistinguishable from that for the rhyolite; unpolished rims on the dioritic zircon are dominantly younger (12 ka) indicating subsequent crystallization. Zircon from rhyolite and diorite overlap in U, Hf, Ti, and REE concentrations although diorites also contain a second population of high-U, high temperature grains. Andesites that brought dioritic blocks to the surface in 2006 contain zircon with young (9 ka) rims and a scattering of older ages, but few zircon that crystallized during the 26 ka interval. Both the Pleistocene-age rhyolite and the 2006 dioritic inclusions plot along a whole-rock compositional trend distinct from mid-Holocene-present andesites and dacites, and the diorites, rhyolite, and two early Holocene dacites define linear unmixing trends often oblique to the main andesite array and consistent with melt (rhyolite) extraction from a mush (dacites), leaving behind a cumulate amphibole-bearing residue (diorites). Rare zircon antecrysts up to approximate to 300 ka from all rock types indicate that a Quaternary center has been present longer than preserved surficial deposits.

J	Cowger, C; Parks, R; Kosman, E				Cowger, Christina; Parks, Ryan; Kosman, Evsey			Structure and Migration in US Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici Populations	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												While wheat powdery mildew occurs throughout the south-central and eastern United States, epidemics are especially damaging in the Mid-Atlantic states. The structure of the U.S. Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici population was assessed based on a sample of 238 single-spored isolates. The isolates were collected from 16 locations in 12 states (18 site-years) as chasmothecial samples in 2003 or 2005, or as conidial samples in 2007 or 2010. DNA was evaluated using nine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in four housekeeping genes, and 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The SSR markers were variably polymorphic, with allele numbers ranging from 3 to 39 per locus. Genotypic diversity was high (210 haplotypes) and in eight of the site-years, every isolate had a different SSR genotype. SNP haplotypic diversity was lower; although 15 haplotypes were identified, the majority of isolates possessed one of two haplotypes. The chasmothecial samples showed no evidence of linkage disequilibrium (P = 0.36), while the conidial samples did (P = 0.001), but the two groups had nearly identical mean levels of genetic diversity, which was moderate. There was a weakly positive relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance (R-2 = 0.25, P = 0.001), indicating modest isolation by distance. Most locations in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions clustered together genetically, while Southeast locations formed a distinct but adjacent cluster; all of these were genetically separated from Southern Plains locations and an intermediate location in Kentucky. One-way migration was detected at a rate of approximately five individuals per generation from populations west of the Appalachian Mountains to those to the east, despite the fact that the Atlantic states experience more frequent and damaging wheat mildew epidemics. Overall, the evidence argues for a large-scale mosaic of overlapping populations that re-establish themselves from local sources, rather than continental scale extinction and re-establishment, and a low rate of long-distance dispersal roughly from west to east, consistent with prevailing wind directions.

Long-time emergence patterns of Limnophora species (Diptera, Muscidae) in specific karst habitats: tufa barriers	LIMNOLOGICA												The hunter-fly genus Limnophora (Muscidae: Coenosiinae) is an important component of running water assemblages. Both adults and larvae are predators, the adults mostly feeding on blackflies (Simuliidae) and other small aquatic insects. This study was conducted at two tufa barriers in Plitvice Lakes National Park (NP) (tufa barrier Labudovac and tufa barrier Kozjak-Milanovac) and at two tufa barriers in Krka National Park (NP) (tufa barrier Roski slap and tufa barrier Skradinski buk). Adults were collected monthly from February 2007 until December 2013 at Plitvice Lakes NP and from September 2013 to October 2014 at Krka NP, using pyramid-type emergence traps. Over the 7-year study period at the Plitvice Lakes tufa barriers, a total of 193 specimens belonging to 6 species were collected, while during the 1-year study period at the Krka tufa barriers a total of 848 specimens belonging to 4 species were collected. Abundance of Limnophora specimens at the Krka NP sites was up to 30 times higher than at the Plitvice Lakes NP sites, which could be attributed to higher levels of potential food and higher water temperatures. The dominant species at the Plitvice Lakes sites were Limnophora pulchriceps and Limnophora riparia. At the Krka tufa barriers, the dominant species at site Roski slap was Limnophora croatica and at site Skradinski buk Limnophora riparia. The highest numbers of emerging specimens at all sites were present in the summer months. At the Plitvice Lakes sites most species were univoltine or bivoltine, while at the Krka sites most species were multivoltine. Water temperature was the main factor influencing the timing of emergence and the duration of the flight period. The highest abundance of Limnophora species was recorded over moss substrate. A significant positive correlation emerged between the numbers of emerging prey and the numbers of emerging specimens of Limnophora. These results give a new insight into the microhabitat preferences and prey-predator relationships of Limnophora. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

They have also been utilized in the design of transfer functions, which can be applied to diatom assemblages in lake sediment cores to infer aspects of past lake hydrochemistry and estimate variables that can be incorporated into paleohydrology models. The Ounianga lakes, in the heart of the Chadian Sahara, possess unique and well-preserved sediment records that extend back beyond the middle Holocene. Today, the lakes display a range of hydrochemical conditions, from fresh to hypersaline. Mainly fed by fossil groundwater that originates in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, measured conductivity across these lakes varies from 217 to 352,000 mu S cm(-1), values that are influenced by factors such as hydrology, local geomorphology (e.g., depth and area), and aquatic vegetation. Although these lakes have been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2012, they have never been studied in detail because they are located on the fringes of the Chadian Sahara. The distribution of diatom taxa in the lakes today is closely linked to water-column physical and chemical conditions, especially conductivity. Whereas each lake has particular features that influence its diatom flora, diatoms across a conductivity gradient enabled identification of three distinct waterbody types, freshwater lakes, meso-saline to hyper-saline lakes, and freshwater springs. Relationships between diatom species distributions and environmental variables were examined using multivariate analysis, which revealed that conductivity is the variable that explains most of the variance in the diatom flora. We used modern diatom assemblages from the lakes to develop a predictive model (transfer function) for conductivity, using the weighted averaging method. Our conductivity prediction model is strong, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 between estimated and measured values, and a value of 0.78 using jackknife estimates of prediction. This study better constrained conductivity optima and tolerance values for diatom species found in the Ounianga lakes, thereby enabling development of a model that will yield better inferences for past conductivity, using diatoms from lake sediment records in the region.

Stuart			Incidence of Mild Cognitive Impairment with Ascending Altitude	HIGH ALTITUDE MEDICINE & BIOLOGY												Background: This study aimed to longitudinally quantify the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in individual trekkers at three different ascending altitudes (Site 1: similar to 3500 m, Site 2: similar to 4400 m, and Site 3: similar to 5100 m). We correlated these findings with the presence of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Materials and Methods: We performed serial assays using the environmental quick mild cognitive impairment (eQMCI) score on 103 English-speaking 18- to 65-year-old volunteers trekking to Everest Base Camp in Nepal during spring 2016. We defined MCI as a score less than 67 (lower scores indicating more cognitive impairment). Additional data collected included the Lake Louise Score, demographics, and other possible confounders. Results: eQMCI scores significantly decreased with ascent from Site 1 to 2 (a score of 78.95 [SD = 7.96] to 74.67 [SD = 8.8] [Site 1-2 p = 0.04]), but then increased on ascent to Site 3 to 83.68 (SD = 8.67) (Site 1-3 p = <0.0001, Site 2-3 p = <0.0001). However, subjects who fulfilled eQMCI criteria for MCI increased despite the overall improvement in score: 6.8% (N = 7) at Site 1, 18.7% (N = 14) at Site 2, and 3.3% (N = 2) at Site 3. Incidence of AMS at Sites 1, 2, and 3 was 22.3% (N = 23), 21.3% (N = 16), and 48.3% (N = 29), respectively. Of those with MCI, 1.94% met criteria for AMS at Site 1 (p = 0.0017), 2.67% at Site 2 (p = 0.6949), and 3.33% at Site 3 (p = <0.0001). Conclusions: There is a significant incidence of MCI at high altitude, even in those without subjective findings of AMS. Interestingly, subjects with a decline in cognitive function show an increasing trend for developing AMS at higher altitude.

Modelling the relative importance of internal and external nutrient loads on water column nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in a shallow polymictic lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Lake Rotorua is a large (area 79 km(2)), shallow (mean depth 10.8m), polymictic lake in central North Island, New Zealand. The lake is eutrophic, with a mean external aerial load of 18.5 mg m(-2) d(-1) for total nitrogen and 1.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) for total phosphorus. Blooms of cyanobacteria and occasional anoxia of bottom waters occur during summer (December-March). We used a vertically resolved water quality model, DYRESM - CAEDYM, to examine the relative importance of internal and external nutrient inputs on water column nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass, with particular emphasis on cyanobacteria. External nutrient loads associated with nine major inflows to the lake and three additional inflows representing smaller geothermal and coldwater flows and residual flows, were represented as inputs to the model. Other forcing inputs to the model included local meteorological data, discharge from the only outflow, the Ohau Channel, and measured rates of sediment nutrient release obtained from benthic chamber deployments which were used to prescribe ranges of sediment nutrient release that were simulated dynamically within the model. Profiles of water column nutrient concentrations, surface chlorophyll a concentrations and continuous temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements were used to validate the model. Simulated water column temperature and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH(4)) concentrations closely matched field measurements, and captured the timing and duration of stratification events as well as subsequent changes in bottom water nutrient concentrations. Surface water concentrations of chlorophyll a were also similar between simulated and observed data. Model simulations indicate that reductions in sediment nutrient fluxes would be more effective in reducing cyanobacterial biomass than similar proportional reductions in catchment fluxes, due to the coincidence of large sediment nutrient release events with high cyanobacterial biomass. This finding indicates that only a significant and prolonged reduction in external loads, which in turn reduces internal loads, will ultimately reduce cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Rotorua.

J	Daniszewski, P				Daniszewski, Piotr			River Odra Estuary (North-West Poland): Assessment of Physical and Chemical Parameters of Water on Basis of European Union Water Framework Directive	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												This paper presents the evaluation of physico-chemical parameters of water river Odra Estuary based on the European union water framework directive. Water is a necessary element for endurance of living on earth, which contains minerals, essential for human being as well as for earth and aquatic life. Lakes have long been at the center of human attention. To address the increasing degradation of surface waters in the European union, the approach to the evaluation and protection of water resources was changed. This approach was formulated in the European union water framework directive (2000/60/EC), which calls for the protection of water, as well as an environment-friendly and comprehensive approach to water assessment. The Odra Estuary includes, as its major part, the brackish Szczecin Lagoon which consists of two parts: the Kleines Haff (located in Germany) and the Wielki Zalew located in Poland. The Lagoon receives the river Odra water supplied from the south; prior to being discharged into the Lagoon, part of the Odra flow passes through Lake Dabie. The Odra (German: Oder) estuary is located at the southern Baltic sea (German-Polish border). It consists of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Pomeranian Bay. The Szczecin Lagoon (687 km(2)) can be subdivided into the "Large Lagoon" (Polish: Wielki Zalew) on the polish territory and the "Small Lagoon" (German: Kleines Haff) on the German side. The Lagoon is connected to the Pomeranian Bay via 3 outlets. The research was carried out in the years 2008-2012, between april and october. From each of the three measuring stations located in the water river Odra estuary included the study, two separate water samples were taken for chemical analysis. The studied water river Odra Estuary had pH values in the neutral range 7.76 to 7.89. According to the classification of the European union water framework directive, all water were classified as first class. The tests have demonstrated that water quality in the water Szczecin Lagoon with regard to the tested indicators varied. By analyzing the average annual values, one can note that the pH, O-2diss and NO3-concentration showed a relatively small variation in all the investigated water. The total suspended solids in the river Odra Estuary, fell into the II class. The P-tot. concentrations in the surface layer of the water river Odra estuary was little differentiated, reaching the levels appropriate for the III quality class according to the classification of the European union water framework directive. The total phosphorus concentration was 0.48-0.69 mgP dm(-3). The concentrations of PO43-diss in the tested waters varied more significantly-corresponding to water quality classes ranging from IV. The concentrations saturation with O-2 was 42.9-96.3 %. In the case of nitrogen compounds, nitrates and nitrites values for these indicators fell into the I and II class in all the surveyed water river Odra Estuary in accordance with the classification of the European union water framework directive. The indicator which proves high productivity of the water is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The level of this indicator in the studied river Odra estuary was at level III. The highest concentration of oxygen in the waters was found in the river Odra Estuary (about 8.3 mg O-2 dm(-3)). In the remaining water oxygen levels were similar (still in I class). National sanitation foundation water quality index (NSF WQI) used for rating of water quality in river Odra estuary indicates that the quality of water is slightly polluted (WQI = 51.4).																			0970-7077	0975-427X				JUL	2014	26	14	B				4219	4223		10.14233/ajchem.2014.16072	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.16072													WOS:000344361100016
J	Hunt, RJ; Strand, M; Walker, JF				Hunt, RJ; Strand, M; Walker, JF			Measuring groundwater-surface water interaction and its effect on wetland stream benthic productivity, Trout Lake watershed, northern Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY					7th INTECOL Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS					Measurements of groundwater-surface water exchange at three wetland stream sites were related to patterns in benthic productivity as part of the US Geological Survey's Northern Temperate Lakes-Water, Energy and Biogeochemical Budgets (NTL-WEBB) project. The three sites included one high groundwater discharge (HGD) site, one weak groundwater discharge (WGD) site, and one groundwater recharge (GR) site. Large upward vertical gradients at the HGD site were associated with smallest variation in head below the stream and fewest gradient reversals between the stream and the groundwater beneath the stream, and the stream and the adjacent streambank. The WGD site had the highest number of gradient reversals reflecting the average condition being closest to zero vertical gradient. The duration of groundwater discharge events was related to the amount of discharge, where the HGD site had the longest strong-gradient durations for both horizontal and vertical groundwater flow. Strong groundwater discharge also controlled transient temperature and chemical hyporheic conditions by limiting the infiltration of surface water. Groundwater-surface water interactions were related to highly significant patterns in benthic invertebrate abundance, taxonomic richness, and periphyton respiration. The HGD site abundance was 35% greater than in the WGD site and 53% greater than the GR site; richness and periphyton respiration were also significantly greater (P <= 0.001, 31 and 44%, respectively) in the HGD site than in the GR site. The WGD site had greater abundance (27%), richness (19%) and periphyton respiration (39%) than the GR site. This work suggests groundwater-surface water interactions can strongly influence benthic productivity, thus emphasizing the importance of quantitative hydrology for management of wetland-stream ecosystems in the northern temperate regions.

J	Abdelsaleheen, O; Taskinen, J; Kortet, R				Abdelsaleheen, Olfat; Taskinen, Jouni; Kortet, Raine			Reproductive cycle, fecundity and growth of the freshwater mussel Unio tumidus (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from Lake Viinijärvi, Finland	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												Freshwater mussels have a substantial role in aquatic ecosystem function and provide valuable ecosystem services, including water filtration, nutrient cycling, habitat creation and sediment stabilization. While they face population declines globally that can negatively affect an ecosystem's health, such as reducing the water quality and increasing the turbidity, lack of information about the basic reproductive biology for most species makes their conservation much more difficult. Here, we monitored a population of Unio tumidus for a year to study its reproductive biology, gonad-dwelling parasites and growth rate in Lake Viinij & auml;rvi, Finland. Our data revealed that this species was dioecious with no evidence of hermaphroditism and was non-significantly female-biased (a male to female ratio of 1:1.3). Both sexes of U. tumidus had continuous gametogenesis during the study period with two peaks in the gonadosomatic index (GSI%) during November and May, followed by two clear declines in December and June. Gravidity period (brooding) of embryos or glochidia in the female's outer gills lasted from June to July. Therefore, this population of U. tumidus can be classified as a short-term breeder (tachytictic). The clear decline of GSI% in December might be a strategy that individuals of U. tumidus use to resorb resources back from the gonad for somatic maintenance during winter. Mean length of glochidia was 391 +/- 0.049 mu m, being among the largest known glochidia for Unionidae. No gonad-dwelling trematode parasites were detected and the population exhibited high fecundity (numbers of oocytes per female), with an average oocyte production of 242,000 +/- 18,000. The studied population had a moderate growth rate with a maximum predicted age of 13 years and asymptotic length (the length at which growth slows down while the mussel continues to age, L infinity) of 114 mm. Our study provides the first quantitative data and histological analysis of the reproductive biology of U. tumidus, serving as a basis for future research and conservation.

Landsat TM has high spatial resolution of 30 meters to monitor details of water bodies. MODIS has its advantage with frequent return visits to monitor algae blooms. Lake Taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in China with cyanophytes blooms annually, which dominates the water sources of Wuxi and Suzhou. The pollution of Taihu Lake has become more and more serious, which leads to contaminated drinking water in Wuxi and Suzhou city. This paper applies 250-meter MODIS level 1B images and Landsat-5 TM images to detect algae blooms, also uses a simplified bio-optical model to estimate concentration of chlorophyll-a in Lake Taihu. The results showed the distribution of algae blooms and chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Taihu at 29(th) July to V August of 2006. The algae blooms often appear at the north and the west of Lake Taihu, which agree with the actual situation. The chlorophyll-a concentrations estimated from MODIS and TM imagery are in appropriate value range in Lake Taihu in summer. The relative errors between in-situ measured and estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations are less than 30%. This study could be helpful to monitor water quality with remote sensing imagery just having red and near-infrared channels such as 250-meter MODIS imagery.

The multidisciplinary study combines sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, palaeontology, palaeobotany, coal petrology, organic geochemistry and magnetic mineralogy. The sedimentary succession studied represents the lake margin at the foot of the Fruska Gora ridge. Sedimentary facies reveal minor and major lake-level changes, including a forced regression with fluvial valley incision in the succession middle part and the ultimate emergence and covering of the lake floor by Pleistocene loess. Mollusc and ostracod fauna indicates an oligohaline shallow cool-water environment, no deeper than 5-6 m, with an active inflow of spring water. The lake local depth during transgression maxima did not exceed 20 m. Palynological and geochemical analyses indicate a rich and diversified assemblage of gymnosperm plants with a contribution of angiosperms, weeds and microbial biomass in the peat-forming suboxic to oxic coastal swamp environment. Maceral analysis of organic matter shows a prevalence of huminite, accompanied richly by inertinite in lignite and by liptinite in clay. The Pleistocene shift to terrestrial semiarid environment resulted in oxidizing groundwater conditions, with the reddening of sediments around a fluctuating groundwater table and the diagenetic transformation of bacteria-derived greigite into magnetite. In regional stratigraphy, the occurrence of Viviparus neumayri Brusina in the lower half of the succession indicates the Lower Paludina Beds of Dacian Stage (early Zanclean age). Other gastropods and certain ostracodes indicate transition to the Middle Paludina Beds of lower Romanian Stage (late Zanclean-early Piacenzian). The upper half of the succession lacks age-diagnostic fossils and is considered to represent Middle Paludina Beds with a possible relic of Upper Paludina Beds at the top.					; Bechtel, Achim/A-9885-2011	Bechtel, Achim/0000-0002-3937-8209; Zivotic, Dragana/0000-0001-6218-7091; Rundic, LJupko/0000-0002-1598-9603; Cvetkov, Vesna/0000-0002-3596-0306													0208-9068						2016	86	2					185	209		10.14241/asgp.2016.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.14241/asgp.2016.003													WOS:000379554400003
J	Schuster, RL; Alford, D				Schuster, RL; Alford, D			Usoi landslide dam and Lake Sarez, Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												In 1911, a 2-km(3) (0.5-mi(3)) earthquake-triggered rock slide blocked the Murgab River, southeastern Tajikistan, forming a still-existing, 600-m-high (1,970-ft-high) natural dam-the highest dam, natural or man-made, in the world. Lake Sarez, impounded by this blockage, is 60 km (37 mi) long, with a maximum depth of 550 m (1,800 ft) and a volume of approximately 17 km(3) (similar to 4 mi(3)). This lake, which has never overtopped the dam, exits the downstream face as a series of large springs that regroup as the Murgab River. Freeboard between lake surface and the lowest point on the dam crest currently is approximately 50 m (similar to 165 ft), and the lake is rising at an average rate of 18.5 cm/yr (7.3 in./yr). If the blockage were to fail, a worst-case scenario could endanger tens or possibly hundreds of thousands of people in the Murgab, Bartang, Panj, and Amu Darya valleys downstream. Dam failure potentially could result from: 1) seismic shaking, 2) catastrophic overtopping caused by a landslide entering the lake from the valley wall at high velocity, 3) surface erosion caused by natural overtopping by the rising lake, 4) internal erosion (piping), 5) instability caused by lake pressure against the dam, or 6) slope instability of the dam faces. Occurrence of an overtopping wave resulting from a potential landslide high on the right bank of Lake Sarez seems to be the most realistic of these slight possibilities for failure. Because of the high cost of installing physical remediation to the dam in this rugged mountain area (no roads lead to the site), the main protective measures now being undertaken are hydrological monitoring at the dam and installation of a flood early warning system downstream.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				MAY	2004	10	2					151	168		10.2113/10.2.151	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/10.2.151													WOS:000227870100004
J	Luong, VV; Bui, DH				Van Viet Luong; Dang Hung Bui			The impact of the decline in area of the storage areas on water level at downstream of the Sai Gon - Dong Nai river system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of climate change, area decline of storage areas due to land levelling and dyke building activities on the water level at downstream of the Sai Gon - Dong Nai river system. The research methods were used include trend analysis and relation analysis between water levels and area of storage areas. The annual statistical data of typical water levels were collected at five monitoring stations from 1980-2018. The area was determined by satellite image classification. Thirty-two images of Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 in 1980-2018 period were used. The results indicated, due to the impact of climate change, the highest and lowest water level of station on the sea (Vung Tau) rose about 0.35 and 0.31 cm/year, respectively. At stations on the river, due to the simultaneous impact of sea-level rise and storage area decline, the water levels changed quite differently from Vung Tau. At stations near the storage areas such as Nha Be and Phu An, the highest water level rose about 1.1-1.2 cm/year, meanwhile, the lowest water level fell or rose insignificantly. There was a tight correlation between typical water levels and the area of storage areas over time, especially at stations near the storage areas. The study results have contributed to clarifying the cause of the extraordinary increase in the highest water level at downstream of the research area.					; Bui, Hung/HZL-4096-2023	Luong, Viet Van/0000-0003-4416-7200; Bui, Dang Hung/0000-0002-7879-6585													1571-5124	1814-2060				APR 3	2021	19	2					169	178		10.1080/15715124.2019.1687488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2019.1687488		NOV 2019											WOS:000496822500001

During intervals when the gravel barrier across its mouth is closed, the salinity in the lake declines and the level may rise to 1 m above the extreme astronomical tide level (EHWS) of the sea outside. A transect of samples through and above the salt marsh on the edge of Lake Onoke identifies three elevation-related foraminiferal zones: M. fusca (up to mid tide level, MSL); M. fusca-Trochamminita salsa (MSL to mean high water level, MHW); and T. salsa-Haplophragmoides wilberti (MHW to 1 m above EHWS). This is the first record of foraminiferal faunas living above EHWS in New Zealand. Foraminiferal faunas in Holocene sediment cores indicate that a much larger, ancestral Lake Onoke (similar to 20 km(2)) was created 4000-3000 cal yr BP, presumably by the growth of a gravel barrier across the previously open mouth to the sea. During the late Holocene, river sand prograded southwards into ancestral Lake Onoke creating swampy alluvial flats that separate modern Lake Onoke from its freshwater counterpart, Lake Wairarapa. Foraminiferal faunas indicate the early Holocene (6500-4000 cal yr BP) presence of an elongate (30 km-long), mostly intertidal embayment extending up the lower Wairarapa Valley beneath present-day Lakes Onoke and Wairarapa. Foraminifera-based elevation estimates suggest that during the early Holocene, this embayment subsided at a rate of about 1-2 mm per yr, sufficient to accommodate the accumulating mud and retain an extensive area (>20 km(2)) of tidal flats. A slowing rate of subsidence accompanied by eustatic sea-level fall probably account for late Holocene aggradation.

Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Virus in Natural Ecosystems of Northern Eurasia (2005-08)	AVIAN DISEASES					7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza	APR 05-08, 2009	Univ Georgia, Athens, GA		Univ Georgia			Fifty-four strains of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus were isolated from wild birds in the ecosystems of northern Eurasia and from poultry in the south of western Siberia (July 2005), at the mouth of Volga River (November 2005), at Uvs-Nur Lake on the boundary of the Great Lakes Depression in western Mongolia and the Tyva Republic of Russia (June 2006), in the vicinity of Moscow (February 2007), in the southeastern parr of the Russian Plain (September 2007 and December 2007), and in the far east (April 2008) of the Russian Federation and were phenotypically characterized and deposited into the Russian state collection or viruses. Complete genome nucleotide sequences for 24 strains were obtained and deposited into GenBank. In all cases when strains were isolated from both wild birds and poultry in the same outbreak these strains were genetically closely related to each other. Until 2008 all HPAI H5N1 strains isolated in northern Eurasia clustered generically with the viruses from Kukunor Lake (Qinghai Province, China), known as genotype 2.2 or the "Qinghai-Siberian" genotype. The viruses from the Qinghai-Siberian genotype have continued to evolve from those initially introduced into western Siberia in 2005 into two genetic groups: "Iran-North Caucasian" and "Tyva-Siberian." In vitro replication potential (50% tissue-culture infectious dose in porcine embryo kidney) of Qinghai-Siberian strains decreased over rime, which could reflect decreasing virulence. Comparison of genome sequences with biological characteristics of the respective strains permitted us to identify point mutations in PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M2, NS1, and NS2 that possibly influenced the level of replication potential. The HPAI H5N1 virus, which penetrated into the south of the Russian Far East in spring 2008, belonged to genotype 2.3.2.

J	Pachell, MA; Evans, JP; Taylor, WL				Pachell, MA; Evans, JP; Taylor, WL			Kilometer-scale kinking of crystalline rocks in a transpressive convergent setting, Central Sierra Nevada, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Structural analyses in the Lake Edison area of the central Sierra Nevada, California, show that prominent north-northeast-trending lineaments represent traces of joints and faults that have accommodated slip within a 4.8-km-wide right-lateral north-northwest-trending monoclinal kink band. The kilometer-scale kink band formed in Cretaceous granitic rocks, and the closely spaced, mineralized joints and faults formed at 79 Ma. Joints and faults strike similar to070degrees within the kink band and 020degrees-030degrees outside the kink band. A kink-band kinematic model indicates that similar to3.7 (+2.1,-1.9) km of right-lateral displacement was accommodated across the kink band and that as much as 148 in of left-lateral slip on faults within the kink band occurred. A sensitivity study on four model parameters varied the angle made by the inner and outer limbs of the kink band, the number of faults within the kink band, and the kink-band width and length. This analysis yields estimates for right-lateral displacement across the kink band and left-lateral slip on faults within the kink band that fall into the range constrained by geologic relationships. Kinking may have been the last stage of right-lateral deformation, which started with development of the Rosy Finch shear zone. The presence of curved lineaments in the southern Sierra Nevada indicates that kilometer-scale kink bands may exist elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Such arc-parallel kinking has been described in several other transpressive settings, and kilometer-scale kink bands may be a process by which late-stage, arc-parallel deformation is accommodated in convergent margins.

Video-capture techniques were used in conjunction with moored temperature loggers to link the disappearance of benthic round gobies to temperature declines during upwelling events along the southern Lake Ontario nearshore in summer of 2019. Benthic water temperatures declined by as much as 18 degrees C within 18 h over as many as nine events. Round goby density estimates were as high as 50/m2 prior to upwellings, but declined to as low as 0/m2 during the events. Using just nine observation dates, ARMA trend analysis suggested a relationship between benthic temperature and round goby abundance (AIC = 78.7, t = 2.21, P = 0.063). Although the actual response of gobies to rapidly declining temperatures was unknown, this population was unobservable in our sample area during upwellings, yet returned to pre-upwelling densities within days. Understanding the magnitude and frequency of fish responses to these events can improve our understanding of the potential for this non-native benthic fish to affect the nearshore environment.

J	Moya, M; Asensio, L; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, J; Navarro, V				Moya, Marina; Asensio, Laura; Sanchez-Vizcaino, Jesus; Navarro, Vicente			Functional behaviour of chimney structures in tufa lakes	JOURNAL OF IBERIAN GEOLOGY												Several cracks and a sinkhole were detected at the bed of Santos Morcillo Lake, Ruidera Lakes Natural Park (central Spain) in 2007. The cracks affected the tufaceous material below the lake water level. To analyse the process, a monitoring system was implemented in the area, which autonomously recorded the lake water level, barometric pressure and crack opening data. In addition, the tufa material was sampled to determine its mechanical properties by laboratory testing, and an electrical resistivity tomography survey was conducted to investigate the unexposed structure of the tufa formation. After this survey, low-resistivity sediments were identified filling sub-vertical chimney-type conduits beneath the lake bottom, which are covered by a slender "crust" of tufa accretion where the cracks were located. This paper presents a simple conceptual model, based on the experimental information obtained, that idealises the behaviour of sediments and crust with equivalent elastic springs. The model reproduces the behaviour observed during the 17 months of monitoring and explains how human action could have altered the natural tufa growth dynamics, ultimately causing the sinkhole to develop. However, the most relevant contribution of the analysis is to acknowledge that the role of the chimneys naturally triggering cracks is not a structural pathology but is instead one of the development stages of the lake bed crust, which could also be the case in other similar systems. Thus, the characterization procedure and the proposed model can be used to both improve the knowledge of tufaceous systems and evaluate their feasible evolution.

J	Haxton, TJ; Friday, MJ				Haxton, Tim J.; Friday, Mike J.			Are we overestimating recovery of sturgeon populations using mark/recapture surveys?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Mark-recaptures studies are often conducted to monitor trends in sturgeon populations. However, many of these studies experience low recapture rates, minimal movement between marking-recapture phases suggesting that sturgeon as a group are not conducive to mark-recapture techniques. In this study, two mark-recapture studies that were conducted differently were reviewed. A study was conducted on the Mattagami River using random nets set throughout the study area in both the mark and recapture phases. The other study was conducted on Lake of the Woods and marked sturgeon in tributaries during the spawning period and the recapture phase within the lake and river during the summer foraging period using random nets sets. Sturgeon's conduciveness to mark-recapture studies was assessed on the Mattagami River mark-recapture study by determining detection probability (p) using a hierarchical Bayesian model with data augmentation among three effects: individual effect, temporal effects, and behavioural response effects. Detection probability was constant over individuals and temporally suggesting model M-0 (Otis, Burnham, White, & Anderson, ) was suitable for lake sturgeon in the Mattagami River; only the M-0 would converge for the Lake of the Woods study. For this study, the assumption that "all individuals have the same probability of being captured during the marking phase" was believed to have been violated given approximately 16%-20% of adult Lake Sturgeon from a population spawn within a year. A population estimate accounting for p provided estimates 56% lower than calculated by a Chapman modification of the Peterson estimate for a closed population. Bias was believed to have been introduced as the Lake of the Woods population did not account for the non-spawning adults that were encountered during the recapture phase and not vulnerable during the initial marking phase. This was not unique to the Lake of the Woods study as other sturgeon studies, especially multi-year, assumes a closed population which potentially biased estimates and overestimated their recovery.

A fluctuating, increasingly saline, terminal lake survived into the late Holocene until upstream water diversions to the Los Angeles Aqueduct began in 1913. Shoreline fragments and beach stratigraphy indicate that the lake reached its highest late Pleistocene level around 23.5 ka, during the Last Glacial Maximum, when it was fed by meltwaters from Sierra Nevada glaciers and spilled southward to Searles Lake and beyond. The lake then fell to relatively low levels after 16.5 ka before experiencing terminal Pleistocene oscillations related to hydroclimatic forcing, which involved changing regional precipitation regimes rather than major inputs from Sierra Nevada glaciers. Two major transgressions occurred. The first culminated around 14.3 ka and was probably related to a cooler, wetter regional climate. The second culminated around 12.8 ka and was linked to the earlier wetter phase of the Younger Dryas cold event. However, the high late Pleistocene shoreline is deformed, and the highest beach ranges in elevation from 1140 m to 1167 m above sea level. If the terminal Pleistocene lake overflowed, as suggested here, then its outlet has also been raised since 12.8 ka. This deformation appears to have involved uplift of the Coso Range magmatic complex relative to subsidence and faulting within the Owens Lake graben between the Sierra Nevada and Inyo Mountains frontal faults. Such deformation confounds simple hydroclimatic explanations of lake behavior and must be incorporated into models that seek to interpret the changing form and geochemistry of Owens Lake and the frequency of its spillage southward to Searles Lake.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2439-3				2008	439						207	225		10.1130/2008.2439(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2008.2439(09)													WOS:000271219900009
J	Gibson, JAE; Vincent, WF; Pienitz, R				Gibson, JAE; Vincent, WF; Pienitz, R			Hydrologic control and diurnal photobleaching of CDOM in a subarctic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in the concentration of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were determined over short (hours to days) and medium (weeks) time scales during summer in a shallow, polymictic lake in subarctic Quebec, Canada. CDOM fluorescence (F-CDOM) decreased linearly from mid-June until early August, consistent with the zero-order kinetics expected for photodegradation of organic matter in a regularly mixed lake in which most of the photochemically-active radiation is absorbed by CDOM. A major rainfall event then resulted in a sharp increase in F-CDOM back to levels recorded at the start of the study. These changes showed that CDOM concentrations were controlled by the balance between catchment inputs and subsequent photodegradation processes within the lake. Shorter term changes in CDOM concentration were monitored by measuring the penetration of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) using a Satlantic TACCS system moored near the center of the take and set to monitor downwelling 380 nm irradiance at 10 min intervals. The diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(380) decreased by 12% during the deployment indicating increased penetration of UVR and the change paralleled the drop in F-CDOM over the same period. Many of the daily records showed a significant decline in K-d(380) in the near-surface waters over the course of the morning and early afternoon indicating diurnal photobleaching of CDOM, and an increase later in the day consistent with the breakdown of the diurnal thermocline and entrainment of deeper waters. The results illustrate the short and medium term dynamics of CDOM, the importance of diurnal stratification and mixing for photochemical processes, and the variability that aquatic organisms must experience in UV exposure in their natural environment.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673													0003-9136					AUG	2001	152	1					143	159																WOS:000170559300008

The objective was to investigate how the vertical distribution of pollutants could be affected by episodic flood sedimentation in archives with high sedimentation rates. Stratigraphic proxies (magnetic susceptibility/MS/, X-ray densitometry and visible-light diffuse reflectance spectrometry), supported by grain-size analyses, enabled us to identify relatively coarse-grained flood layers and correlate them in the proximal-to-distal direction in the oxbow-lake delta. A correlation of the flood layers with the time series of the river discharge was used to improve the age model based primarily on (137)Cs dating. The refined age model is nonlinear and shows periods of lower and higher sediment accumulation rates, which coincided with periods of lower and higher frequency of floods in the river, respectively. Concentrations of most heavy metals, normalized to lithogenic aluminium, revealed vigorous short-term variation related to floods, whose magnitude exceeds that of long-term trends. There is a substantial risk that temporal contamination trends. even if normalized to lithogenic elements, can be strongly influenced by facies, which may lead to potential misinterpretations. Element normalizing to MS, which proved to be a good proxy of grain size, provided smoother long-term trends whose interpretation was less affected by short-term variations. The long-term trends exhibit decreasing concentrations of most heavy metals for the last similar to 25 years, most notably between similar to 1987 and similar to 1992. These historical patterns correspond well to the significant improvement in environmental pollution reported elsewhere in Central Europe. In contrast, concentrations of Na have systematically increased up until the present, partly being driven by the widespread use of de-icing salt for winter road treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mosindy, TE; Duffy, MJ				Mosindy, Thomas E.; Duffy, Mark J.			The use of angler diary surveys to evaluate long-term changes in muskellunge populations on Lake of the Woods, Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Reported improvements in the muskellunge angling fishery on Lake of the Woods, Ontario over the last two decades have paralleled an increase in the practice of catch and release angling, and an increase in minimum size regulations for this species. The overall status of muskellunge populations in this large, complex lake has proven difficult to monitor using standard assessment methods. A volunteer muskellunge angler diary program, established in 1988, has provided a cost effective method of gathering a large amount of information with which to track this fishery and associated populations. Results from angling diaries indicated increased angling effort, catch and success rates for muskellunge on Lake of the Woods since the early 1990s. Although the month of July accounted for the majority of angling effort and catch, angling success rates and sizes of fish reported in diaries improved monthly into the late fall. Angling success rates were consistently higher in angling diaries than from creel surveys, but both survey types showed similar long-term trends in the fishery. Angler diary data, incorporating both the numbers of fish caught and/or seen by anglers, were used to calculate catch equality indices which proved to be sensitive to changes in population abundance. Increased minimum length regulations for muskellunge during 1987-2001 have been largely responsible for a decline in harvest rates from an estimated 36% in 1986 to 0% since 1999. Although higher size limits have yet to produce more quality-sized fish in angler catches, diary survey data, supported by recent improvements in catch rates from assessment gill nets, would indicate that muskellunge recruitment has increased. This article concludes with a brief review of how muskellunge angler diary data has been used in the past, including recommendations to minimize biases associated with this survey method.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2007	79	1-2					71	83		10.1007/s10641-006-9167-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9167-4													WOS:000245869600008

Given the surface area of the lake and the adjusted endemicity rate, it may be also defined as the most diverse of all the ancient lakes in the world. From all the animal groups endemic to this lake, gammarids are amongst the most scarcely known in terms of their diversity and phylogenetic relationships. Partial DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) of eight known endemic Gammarus species from the Lake Ohrid valley were analysed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that endemic Gammarus species comprise an ancient species flock, with Gammarus sketi from the feeder springs being their sister taxon outside the lake. Amongst the species inhabiting the lake, Gammarus solidus and Gammarus salemaai are morphologically and molecularly well defined. By contrast, Gammarus ochridensis, Gammarus parechiniformis, Gammarus lychnidensis, and Gammarus stankokaramani revealed high discrepancy between morphological and genetic data. None of these morphospecies form a monophyletic clade and a significant degree of apparent gene flow occurs between them. This could be caused by incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization events. Two novel mtDNA lineages were found within the lake, possibly constituting two new species (Gammarus sp. 1 and Gammarus sp. 2). Molecular clock analysis showed that the split between G.sketi and the Gammarus species flock from the lake occurred approximately 57Mya, whereas within the flock there were at least two intralacustrine radiations: one estimated at 23Mya and the second at less than 1Mya. The first one could be associated with the origin of the lake and the second with the lake water-level fluctuations during Pleistocene.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 167, 345-359. doi: 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00878.x					Sworobowicz, Lidia/D-1923-2019; Wysocka, Anna/ABA-1158-2021; Burzynski, Artur/J-7048-2012; Grabowski, Michal/K-1016-2012	Sworobowicz, Lidia/0000-0003-3266-1471; Kilikowska, Adrianna/0000-0002-5726-618X; Burzynski, Artur/0000-0002-0185-197X; Grabowski, Michal/0000-0002-4551-3454; Wysocka, Anna/0000-0003-1218-7311													0024-4082	1096-3642				MAR	2013	167	3					345	359		10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00878.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00878.x													WOS:000316749600001

We evaluated the effects of additions nitrate (N as NO3-) and phosphate (P as PO43-) on phytoplankton in a temperate lake reservoir (Lake Murray, South Carolina). High-performance liquid chromatography and ChemTax were used to measure concentrations of microalgal groups in the lake in 2021-2023 and bioassays. The phytoplankton community during the summer months consisted of green algae (37%), diatoms (27%), cryptophytes (20%), cyanobacteria (11%) and dinoflagellates (4%). Bioassays of N (20-mu M NaNO3), P (10-mu M KH2PO4) and N + P additions were conducted monthly from April to October 2023. All microalgal groups, except cyanobacteria, exhibited nutrient co-limitation with N as the primary limiting nutrient. Similarly, cyanobacteria exhibited co-limitation, but with P as the primary limiting nutrient. Nutrient additions of N + P (but not N or P singularly) also resulted in significant community shifts, with a strong response by green algae. The management implications for this study are that increases in N and P loading and ratio changes in the lake may result in major phytoplankton community changes toward dominance by green algae. However, increasing P loading relative to N may promote cyanobacterial growth over other phytoplankton groups in this lake system.

The objective was to characterize succession of the community following a natural experiment in 2000-2001, when release of water from the lake, followed by a severe drought, reduced water levels by 2 m, alleviating stress of multiple years of high water. A systematic survey of shoreline transects was used to compare attributes of submerged plants under pre-drought versus post-drought conditions. Initially, the plants did not respond to lower water because shoreline areas had high turbidity from resuspended sediments and, later algal blooms. In June 2000, approximately 2 months after the water level was lowered, Chara (a macro-alga) rapidly expanded across the near-shore landscape. For over I year, this plant strongly dominated the submerged plant community, with just scattered individuals or isolated beds of vascular plants, including Potamogeton, Vallisneria, and Hydrilla. This included a period when the lake reached a record low elevation, where much of the habitat became dry, and then subsequently re-flooded in late summer 2001. However, in November 2001, Chara rapidly declined and vascular taxa (Hydrilla and Potamogeton) became dominant. They subsequently increased their biomass and spatial extent, and the previous Chara dominance did not return. Just prior to the loss of Chara, a frontal system passed over the lake, with wind velocities in excess of 30 km h(-1) for 3 days. Concentrations of solids in the water more than doubled and uprooted Chara was observed floating in the water. In this large, wind-driven lake, Chara may only be an ephemeral pioneer because, lacking roots, it is probably more sensitive to excessive wind-related stress (e.g. wave energy and scouring) than vascular plants.

J	Mickan, C; Junghanss, T; Stojkovic, M				Mickan, Christina; Junghanss, Thomas; Stojkovic, Marija			Tropical Medicine in an Age of High Global Mobility Schistosomiasis in a School Class after Travel to Rwanda	DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT												Introduction Schistosomiasis is one of the most common parasitic diseases worldwide. If left untreated, intestinal (Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi) and urogenital (S. haematobium) chronic disease manifestations occur depending on the parasite load. The early phase however is characterized by fever and an immune-complex-mediated illness. Long-distance travel to tropical regions is on the rise, academic partnerships and humanitarian missions take even young people to developing countries. Methods 12 students from a German secondary school had fresh water exposure during a 14-day school trip to Rwanda in Lake Kivu in the west of the country. After returning to Germany, one of the students fell ill with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), which led to examination of the other students. WBC, differential blood count, serology for schistosomal antibodies and ova detection in urine and stool were performed on first presentation and 6 and 12 months after therapy. Results Positive antibody results indicated infection in all students, eosinophilia was found in 9 patients, ova of S. mansoni were detected in 3 cases. At presentation in our outpatient department 11 of the 12 students were asymptomatic. All patients received therapy with praziquantel. Discussion Tropical diseases will further increase due to high global mobility. For their prevention and diagnosis physicians need to be sensitized beyond subject specific units. We describe an outbreak of schistosomiasis in a school class to sensitize physicians outside endemic areas. Since the disease is often asymptomatic a high number of unrecognized infections and illnesses can be assumed. When suspecting or treating schistosomiasis, a specialized center should always be consulted.																			0012-0472	1439-4413				AUG	2019	144	17					E109	E113		10.1055/a-0852-4783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-0852-4783								31096278					WOS:000482978200001
J	HARRISON, SP; PRENTICE, IC; GUIOT, J				HARRISON, SP; PRENTICE, IC; GUIOT, J			CLIMATIC CONTROLS ON HOLOCENE LAKE-LEVEL CHANGES IN EUROPE	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Sensitivity experiments with a simple water-balance model were used to constrain the possible climatic causes of distinct Holocene patterns of lake-level variation in different regions of Europe. Lakes in S Sweden were low at 9 ka, high around 6.5 ka, low again around 4 ka and are high now. Lakes in Estonia show similar but weaker trends. Lakes in S France were highest around 9 ka, lowest around 4 ka, intermediate now. Lakes in Greece were also high around 9 ka but continued rising until 7.5 ka, then fell gradually from 5 ka with a brief high phase around 3 ka, and are low now. The model was forced with insolation anomalies deduced from orbital variations, temperature anomalies inferred from the pollen record and cloudiness anomalies derived from changes in the position of the subtropical anticyclone (inferred from reconstructed changes in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient), in order to evaluate the effects of resultant evaporation changes on catchment water balance. The resulting simulated changes in runoff (precipitation minus actual evapo-transpiration) were slight, and frequently opposite to the observed trends. Larger changes in precipitation are plausible and are required to explain the data. The required precipitation increase in N Europe from 9 ka (low) to 6 ka (high) is suggested by GCM experiments to have been a consequence of interacting insolation and residual ice-sheet effects on the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. The explanation of other observed changes, including the drying trend during the Holocene in S Europe, has not been provided by GCM experiments to date. Explanations may lie in changes in mesoscale circulation, sea-surface temperature patterns and the coupling between these phenomena that may not follow orbital changes in any simple way.

A comparison of the effects of water-level policies on the availability of walleye spawning habitat in a boreal reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Papenfuss JT, Cross T, Venturelli PA. 2018. A comparison of the effects of water-level policies on the availability of walleye spawning habitat in a boreal reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:321-333.Water levels in reservoirs can affect the quantity and quality of the habitat that is available for spawning fish and their eggs. We studied how a change in the water-level management policy (rule curve) in 2000 affected the availability of walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning habitat in 3 lakes (Kabetogama, Namakan, and Sand Point) that make up a large, boreal reservoir between Canada and the United States. According to observed water-level data, available spawning habitat on known Lake Kabetogama spawning sites increased 95% (P < 0.01) with the 2000 rule curve, but did not change on Namakan or Sand Point lake spawning sites. However, when using modeled water-level data to control for confounding weather events, habitat availability at known spawning sites increased significantly (P < 0.01) on all 3 lakes (179%, 92%, and 93%, respectively). Habitat availability improved because the 2000 rule curve increased mean spring water levels by 0.5m, and water levels rose more slowly (2.2 vs. 3.0cm/d) during egg incubation. Our findings suggest that, although water-level management on large reservoirs can be a challenge, carefully designed policies can improve walleye spawning habitat conditions and help to achieve fisheries management goals.

Although in the majority of neighboring countries the occurrence of this tick species is well-documented (i.e., in Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine), to-date its occurrence in Poland has been registered only once, in 1953 in Troszyn in North-Western Pomerania, close to the German-Polish border. In the present study we report the first documented finding of H. concinna in Western Poland, confirmed both by collection of juvenile ticks from rodent hosts and questing ticks from vegetation. Trapping of rodents took place in the summer of 2018 in three locations in Western Poland (Sonin, Nowy Myn 1, Nowy Myn 2). Rodents were inspected for ectoparasites, which were detached and fixed in 70% ethanol. All the collected ticks were assigned to species and developmental stages using appropriate morphological keys, and representative individuals were genotyped by molecular methods. A total of 1482 feeding ticks were collected from 106 rodents from three sites. The common tick Ixodes ricinus was found in abundance on small rodents at all three sites; Dermacentor reticulatus ticks were identified at two sites in small numbers and, finally, numerous juvenile H. concinna (n=427) were found at one of our study sites (Nowy Myn 2). The highest prevalence and abundance of H. concinna were recorded on voles, Microtus agrestis and M. oeconomus, from this site in August. Additionally, questing nymphs and adult H. concinna were collected locally from vegetation (n=20). Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the species as H. concinna. A new focus of H. concinna has been described in Western Poland. Our long-term field work monitoring the expansion of the distribution of D. reticulatus in Poland, during which all collected ticks are identified, suggests that H. concinna is still very rare in the country.					; Dwużnik-Szarek, Dorota/JXY-8581-2024	Alsarraf, Mohammed/0000-0002-6330-0719; Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458													0168-8162	1572-9702				MAY	2019	78	1					93	112		10.1007/s10493-019-00371-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-019-00371-7								31115732					WOS:000469499300007

Another species, the Andean goose, lives in the High Andes all year round. Possession of a Hb with high oxygen affinity helps to adapt bar-headed and Andean geese to high altitudes. The Hb amino acid sequences of the bar-headed and the greylag geese differ by four substitutions, of which only one is unique among bird sequences: Pro-119-alpha(H2) --> Ala. Perutz proposed that the two-carbon gap left by this substitution at the alpha-1-beta-1 contact raises the oxygen affinity, because it relaxes the tension in the deoxy or T structure [Perutz, M. F. (1983) Mol. Biol. Evol. 1, 1-28]. It was later found that the Hb of the Andean goose has a gap in the same position, due to the complementary substitution Leu-55-beta(D6) --> Ser. We have tested Perutz's hypothesis by introducing each of these substitutions into human globin synthesized in Escherichia coli. The reconstituted Hbs combine cooperatively with oxygen. Their oxygen affinities exceed that of normal human Hb by an even larger factor than that found between the high-flying geese and the greylag goose. The mutant Hb Met-55-beta(D6) --> Ser was crystallized. Its structure is the same as that of HbA, except in the immediate environment of the gap left by the substitution of the serine for the methionine side chain, which evidently causes the increased oxygen affinity of this Hb.																			0027-8424					AUG	1991	88	15					6519	6522		10.1073/pnas.88.15.6519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.88.15.6519								1862080					WOS:A1991FZ34400028
J	SOMLYODY, L; KONCSOS, L				SOMLYODY, L; KONCSOS, L			INFLUENCE OF SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION ON THE LIGHT CONDITIONS AND ALGAL GROWTH IN LAKE BALATON	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Wind-induced sediment resuspension and its impact on the light conditions were intensively studied in three basins of Lake Balaton, a large shallow lake in Hungary, which is subject to eutrophication. The depth ranges between 2 and 5 m. Frequent observations were made of the wind, the water flows and waves, the suspended solids (ss) concentration, the Secchi disc depth and the light conditions. Four versions of the model were developed for describing the temporal changes in the ss concentration. Models of similar structures were applied for the extinction coefficient and the Secchi disc depth. Several methods were used for calibration. Identifiability and arbitrariness of the model structures have been studied. The extinction model was coupled to a known mass balance equation describing temporal changes in the algal biomass. Sensitivity analysis using hypothetical step-like wind inputs has shown a considerable change in the light limitation factor as compared to the case of steady state winds. Finally, the coupled extinction-algae biomass model was used in a Monte Carlo fashion when longer subsets were selected at random from past wind observations. Late summer conditions and parameters typical for the most eutrophic basin of Lake Balaton (where nutrients are no longer limiting) were selected. The analysis has demonstrated that, in harmony with the observations, the wind has a major impact on the short-term changes of algal biomass. The approach outlined can be utilized to improve the earlier ecosystem models applied for Lake Balaton. The methodology developed is transferable to other shallow lakes.

Total water surface area meets 14,000 ha, of which the lakes cover 10,000 ha. The regional catchment area is about 305,000 ha. In summer periods inflow of water from Lake Usselmeer keeps the system on a constant water table of 0.52 m below sea level. At the end of the sixties the lakes became hypertrophic. Algae were dominating the biocenoses and submerged water plants disappeared. Systematic investigations started in 1970, and biological data were included from 1976 on. During twenty years a stable, but highly eutrophic situation, passed. Blue-green algae, especially Oscillatoria agardhii, were dominating the phytoplankton. Submerged vegetation was absent and bream dominated the fish-stock. From 1991 onwards there is a slight improvement in water quality. Transparency increased, phosphorus concentration and algal biomass decreased. Also a shift in phytoplankton species occurred. Dominance of O. agardhii decreased and species diversity increased. First submerged water plants recovered in 1994. Improvements are induced by a combination of measures and a culmination of small effects. Results of 14 years of water quality research are presented. Results are given as trends in time. Attention is paid to the spatial gradient in the province as well. From south to north the chain-arranged lakes represent a remarkable pattern of, increasing trophic state, caused by regional loading of nutrients. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

In general, there was good agreement between the changes inferred from both organismal groups in this suite of lakes. Significant correlations were observed between chemical conditions inferred from organisms in surface sediments and present-day land uses, especially the percentages of the watersheds that are forest or residential land cover types. Approximately 20% of the waterbodies have significantly increased in pH since 1890, and none of the lakes have significantly declined in pH despite the fact that this region receives significant amounts of acidic deposition. These findings support previous work, indicating that the pH of Connecticut lakes has not declined over the recent past. One fourth of the lakes have significantly increased in specific conductivity, especially those situated in watersheds that have become highly residential in nature. Inferred specific conductivity has more than doubted in six of the lakes during the last century. Six of the lakes have become significantly more eutrophic, while only one lake has become more oligotrophic since 1890. The majority of the lakes situated in watersheds that have remained over similar to 80% forested have not significantly changed, whereas those that have become over similar to 25% residential have experienced the greatest amount of change. The potential influences of watershed-based alkalinity generation, winter road salt use, and implications of these findings in lake management are discussed.																			0024-3590					DEC	1999	44	8					1928	1935		10.4319/lo.1999.44.8.1928	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.8.1928													WOS:000084125600008

Here we characterized the spatial heterogeneity of methane production potential, methane concentration, archeal and bacterial communities across Lake Remoray sediment during the summer period when hypoxic conditions settle in the deepest part of the water column. It was hypothesized that methane concentration and production would be higher in the deeper part of the lake, our results showed that some littoral areas exhibited similar or higher values than the deepest area. The full 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset counted 41 OTUs affiliated with methanogenic species in abundances that depended more on sampling-site location than on the water depth gradient. The methanogenic co-occurrence network revealed the existence of five distinct sub-communities, suggesting the presence of different methanogenic niches across Lake Remoray. The variation in abundance of the two larger methanogenic sub-communities was significantly related to methanogenesis potential and sediment methane concentration across-lake but further studies investigating their real activities would provide additional insights. In a globally changing environment (temperature, eutrophication, horizontal ellipsis ) a better understanding of the functional specificities and characteristics of the potential of methane cycle actors would allow us to better predict their future implications for greenhouse gas production and mitigation.					; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Etienne, David/A-7675-2013; Lyautey, Emilie/OEM-8549-2025	Etienne, David/0000-0001-6388-7241; Lyautey, Emilie/0000-0003-0754-197X; Tardy, Vincent/0000-0001-9592-8343; Millet, Laurent/0000-0003-2050-206X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV	2022	127	11							e2021JG006776	10.1029/2021JG006776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006776													WOS:000888568900001

Partitioning the contributions of minerogenic particles and bioseston to particulate phosphorus and turbidity	INLAND WATERS												Protocols to partition the contributions of bioseston and minerogenic particles to turbidity (T-n) and particulate phosphorus (PP), as described by summations of the 2 components, are developed, tested, and applied. The analysis is based on coincident observations of T-n, PP, chlorophyll a (Chl), and the summation of the projected areas of individual minerogenic particles per unit volume (PAV(m)) for the wide variations encountered in time and between near-shore and pelagic sites over an 8-year study of Cayuga Lake, New York. PAVm was determined from an individual particle analysis technique, scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image, and X-ray analyses (SAX). The partitionings are based on a stoichiometric approach that adopts Chl and PAV(m) as the metrics of bioseston and minerogenic particles, respectively, and estimates developed here for stoichiometric ratios that relate T-n and PP to these 2 components. The systematically higher T-n and PP levels at the near-shore site, particularly following runoff events, are demonstrated to be a result of elevated PAV(m) associated with allochthonous inputs. A reasonably good match of the partitioned 2-component summations with bulk observations is reported. Application of the 2-component PP model establishes minerogenic particles made, on average, noteworthy (similar to 10%) to substantial (>= 20%) contributions to PP. The minerogenic particle component of PP was largely responsible for the greater summer average total phosphorus (TP) concentrations at the near-shore versus the pelagic site, the interannual variations in the differences between these sites, and exceedance of the TP water quality limit at the near-shore site. Minerogenic particles were the dominant component of T-n, a finding that is demonstrated to be consistent with optical theory, based on the much greater efficiency of side-scattering for minerogenic versus organic particles.

A modified version of the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance method was used. Of 897 paddocks on 30 farms, 161 (1,558 ha) contained S. neesiana and a total of 129 ha was occupied solely by S. neesiana. The dominant agricultural activity on infested paddocks was sheep grazing "improved" pasture (133 paddocks). Of 18 farms supporting populations of S. neesiana, 16 formed a contiguous group. The distribution of the infested paddocks among cover classes was; 131 paddocks (1,271 ha) with < 5% cover of the species, 16 paddocks (123 ha) with 5-25% cover, 7 paddocks (117 ha) with 25-50% cover, 3 paddocks (16 ha) with 50-75% cover and 4 paddocks (32 ha) with > 75% cover. The distribution of infested paddocks among dispersion modes was; 41 (298 ha) as solitary plants, 104 (1,066 ha) as clumps or dense groups and 16 (194 ha) as large almost pure stands. The pattern of cover suggests that S. neesiana is radiating outward from a central point of introduction. The occurrence of extensive areas of apparently suitable yet uninfested habitat, and anecdotal information suggesting introduction occurred about 60 years ago, indicates the invasion may be in a lag phase.

J	Colle, BA; Olson, JB; Tongue, JS				Colle, BA; Olson, JB; Tongue, JS			Multiseason verification of the MM5. Part II: Evaluation of high-resolution precipitation forecasts over the northeastern United States	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												This paper evaluates the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University - National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) precipitation forecasts over the northeastern United States to show the effects of increasing resolution, the spatial variations in model skill, and the impact of convective parameterizations on the MM5 precipitation forecasts. The MM5 is verified during the cool seasons ( November - March) of 1999 2001 and the warm season ( May - September) of 2000 using approximately 500 cooperative observer and National Weather Service precipitation sites. During the cool season, the 12-km MM5 produces excessive precipitation immediately downwind of the Great Lakes and along the windward slopes of the Appalachians and too little precipitation in the lee of the barrier. The 36-km MM5 has slightly more skill than at 12-km grid spacing for the light to moderate thresholds, while the 12-km precipitation forecasts are slightly better on average for the heavy precipitation events. During the 2000/01 cool season, two separate MM5 runs were completed twice daily using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta ( Eta - MM5) and Aviation ( AVN - MM5) Models for initial and boundary conditions. The Eta - MM5 had slightly lower ( better) rms errors than the AVN - MM5 for the weak to moderate thresholds ( 2.54 - 50.8 mm in 24 h), while for the heavier thresholds the AVN - MM5 had significantly lower rms errors than the Eta - MM5. As a result, the 36-km AVN - MM5 was as skillful as the 12-km Eta - MM5 for these higher thresholds. During the warm season, both the 36- and 12-km grid spacings overpredict precipitation just inland of the coast and significantly underpredict farther inland over the Appalachians. This coastal overprediction originated from an overactive Kain-Fritsch (KF) convective parameterization, while the inland underprediction is associated with a low-level dry bias during the warm season. A representative case study shows that both the Betts-Miller and Grell parameterizations produce less precipitation near the coast than the overactive KF scheme. A new and alternate version of KF (KF2) in the MM5 may also help to reduce this coastal overprediction. The 4-km MM5 explicit precipitation during the summer is sensitive to which convective parameterization is applied in the outer domains. Using KF or KF2 in the 36- and 12-km domains suppresses the explicit precipitation in the 4-km nest, especially for weak to moderate events over western sections of the 4-km domain. For a representative event, the Betts - Miller and Grell convective schemes allowed for a more realistic 4-km precipitation distribution, while a simulation using no convective parameterization in the 36- and 12-km domains produced excessive rain rates in the 4-km forecasts.

Recent ecological trends in lower trophic levels of the international section of the St. Lawrence River: a comparison of the 1970s to the 2000s	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes from the 1970s to 2000s in phosphorus and chlorophyll levels, water transparency, zooplankton, and benthic communities in the upper, International Section of the St. Lawrence River were evaluated using trend data from limnological surveys. The influence of Lake Ontario as a source for riverine production was evident in the upper river. Total phosphorus levels from 1976 to 1978 (average similar to 20 mu g/l) sampled during a period of nutrient pollution declined (to 6-7 mu g/l) following abatement. As expected, water transparency indicated by summer Secchi depths showed an opposite response increasing from similar to 3.5 m in the 1970s to > 10 m by 2003 but declined to 6-7 m in more recent years. Zooplankton communities have experienced declines in overall densities, and the community has changed but its primary components, Bosmina and Diacyclops remain. Ceriodaphnia lacustris abundance declined substantially from the 1970s to the recent time period while Chydorus sphaericus increased and Eurytemora affinis and Cercopagis pengoi had first appearances. In contrast, benthic invertebrate biomass increased substantially between time periods. Increases in families and occurrence of gastropods were observed, but the primary components-chironomids, amphipods, and oligochaetes-were consistent between the periods with the exception of dreissenid mussels. Dreissena was dominated by D. bugensis, and both D. bugensis and D. polymorpha show evidence of recent declines. Conversely, high abundance of round goby (Apollonia melanostomus) has promoted new trophic pathways. Downstream attenuation in nutrients and chlorophyll, and increased transparency suggest continued strong effects of Lake Ontario on the downstream river environment, but increased energy in the benthos has likely promoted greater in situ production.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2010	647	1					21	33		10.1007/s10750-009-0003-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0003-7													WOS:000277241700003

Northern pike (Esox lucius) in a warming lake:: changes in population size and individual condition in relation to prey abundance	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Pike Symposium held at the 136th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	SEP 05, 2006	Lake Placid, NY	Amer Fisheries Soc				Climate change is anticipated to have differential effects on the salmonid and percid-cyprinid components of lake fish communities, which may in turn impact the foraging conditions and so population biology of top aquatic predators including northern pike (Esox lucius Linnaeus). Since the 1940s, extensive monitoring has been undertaken on the northern pike, the salmonid Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and the percid Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) populations and environmental features of the mesotrophic north and eutrophic south basins of Windermere in the English Lake District, UK Analysis of data from 1982 to 2006 revealed basin-specific changes in the degree of eutrophication, but a common warming of the lake in the 1990s was accompanied by contrasting trends in the two basins' northern pike populations. Following a common temporary increase in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) during the 1980s in response to a lake-wide decrease in fishing pressure, CPUE of the south basin subsequently decreased while that of the north basin showed a second increase in the late 1990s to reach a peak in 2000. In addition, the mean weight at length of female northern pike was initially similar between the two basins but then increased in the north basin from the early 1990s to the early 2000s before decreasing, while in the south basin it has shown a decrease since 2000. These changes are interpreted with respect to contrasting trends in potential prey populations, including an overall decrease in the abundance of the coldwater Arctic charr, particularly in the more eutrophic south basin where hypolimnetic oxygen levels have fallen to very low levels, and a recent marked increase in the abundance of the warmwater roach (Rutilus rutilus) in both basins. It is concluded that although indirect in nature, the recent warming of Windermere has had a significant impact on its northern pike populations.

Dynamics of natural conditions around modern glaciation location at the Eastern Sayan	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mountain massif Munku-Sardyk presents the highest mountain range and adjacent Stanovoy ridge highlands of the Eastern Sayan. There is situated modern glaciation site which was the most studied in the course of last 160 years. This periglacial area experienced different periods of cooling and warming in the Holocene and retained traces of the Sartan glaciation of Subboreal (3000-5000 years ago), the Little Ice Age, the evidences of Holocene optimum and general warming last time. The authors examined the variability of activity of modern glaciation and variation of natural conditions of the periglacial zone on climate and on dendrochronological data. Results of larch and Siberian stone pine growth data were revealed at the higher border of forest communities. Analysis of the growth of the "fossil" tree in the Holocene optimum showed that the absolute magnitude of its increment was two times higher than for up-to-date long-lived trees. Identified periods of the Peretolchin glacier retreat in 1900-1965 and 1983-2000 years took place with increased growth of trees and the rate of sedimentation in proglacial lake, and vice versa glacier advance on in 1965-1980 years was accompanied by slowing of tree increments and reduction in sedimentation rate. Since 2000, there has been growth of trees instability associated with a decrease in average monthly summer temperatures.

J	Gevorgyan, A; Melkonyan, H				Gevorgyan, Artur; Melkonyan, Hamlet			Regional impact of the Armenian highland as an elevated heat source: ERA-Interim reanalysis and observations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The heat-driven plain-plateau circulation producing strong summertime winds in Yerevan has been examined. The study indicates that the formation of plain-plateau circulation over the Armenian Highland is the combined product of large-scale and local circulations. There is significant enhancement of the westerly subtropical jet over the study region, Caspian Sea and further to the east in the upper troposphere in days with severe wind gusts in Yerevan. Further, the influence of major monsoon systems (Indian and African) on the plain-plateau circulation over the Armenian Highland is considered in this study. Both observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis data show the existence of intense heat source over the southeastern and southern parts of the Armenian Highland which produces an extra daytime warming exceeding 2.1 degrees C on average at the ground surface during days with severe gusts in Yerevan. This warm center is maintained through 700 hPa level and it disappears in the middle and upper troposphere. The plateau atmospheric boundary layer can extend beyond 4,000 m above mean sea level (up to the middle troposphere) during the afternoon. By contrast, exposed mountain ranges stretching along the Black and Caspian seas are characterized by significant negative temperature differences. It should be noted that ERA-Interim reanalysis data strongly underestimate the significant negative differences in mean daytime temperatures over northeastern, southeastern parts of Armenia and over Sevan Lake basin found in observed data. The results suggest intensification of the plain-plateau circulation over the Armenian Highland induced by recent surface warming over the study region. Temperature projections over the study region for the twenty-first century show that the enhancement of the plain-plateau circulation can be expected under future climate conditions.					; Gevorgyan, Artur/HSI-1776-2023	Gevorgyan, Artur/0000-0003-1220-3617; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	2015	44	5-6					1541	1565		10.1007/s00382-014-2236-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2236-z													WOS:000350364500022
J	Paklina, NV; van Orden, C				Paklina, NV; van Orden, C			The current state of kiang (Equus kiang) population in the southwestern part of its range	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The investigations in September-October 1998 revealed that a significant part of the kiang (Equus kiang Moorcroft 1841) population dwelled the southwestern Tibet (31-35degreesN, 82-86degrees51' E) in China. The number of the population is approximately 28500 individuals per 190000 km(2). During a month car route, 1126 individuals were recorded on a distance of 3806 kin. About 90% of the animals were concentrated in three big aggregations near lakes at an altitude of 4000-5000 m above sea level. In these sites, the density of the kiang population was 0.6-4.2 ind./km(2), whereas the mean density did not reach 0.15 ind./km(2). The social structure of the population was the following: solitary animals (1.1%), pairs (1.6%), and groups of 3 to 160 individuals (97.3%). The mean size of groups (including pairs) was 23.2 individuals (n = 1114). In October 1999 in Ladakh (India), kiangs were found only in the southeastern part of the Changtang Plateau (4000-4600 in above sea level) near Tsokar Lake (58 individuals) and Pangong Lake (5 individuals). The small size of groups (from 4 to 26 kiangs) appeared to be a result of a smaller size of the Ladakh population compared to that of Chinese one. Migratory ways of kiangs remain to be explored. The kiang population needs protection, especially in the Tibet, in the sites, where they form great aggregations in winter. At this time, they can be easily shot by hunters.																			0044-5134					MAR	2003	82	3					413	416																WOS:000182343700012

This study explored the relationship between standing vegetation and the soil seed bank representing four vegetation cover types on the shoreline of Lake Taihu (China) using a seed germination method. The vegetation cover types consisted of the fleabane lakeshore zone (Zone A), bush and grass lakeshore zone (Zone B), crop lakeshore zone (Zone C), and natural reed lakeshore zone (Zone D). The viability of the seeds of all species found during a survey of standing vegetation in the summer of 2010 was assessed using greenhouse germination trials. The fleabane, bush and grass, crop, and natural reed lakeshore zones had 4, 16, 8, and 6 species from the seed bank, respectively. Sorensen similarity coefficients resulting from comparisons of the species found in the seed bank and in the standing vegetation of those same four habitats were 0.250, 0.333, 0.143, and 0.154, respectively. Low similarity levels between standing vegetation and the seed banks indicate that we should increase work on wetland protection and management because of its potentially low recovery ability. Seed density was significantly lower in Zone B (4933 +/- 1683 number/m(2)) than in the other zones (Zone A: 1160 +/- 502 number/m(2); Zone C: 1360 +/- 587 number/m(2); and Zone D: 1200 +/- 961 number/m(2). The vertical distribution of seeds in the seed bank at the four zones showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The reserves of seeds in the topsoil seed bank accounted for 64.10%, 60.00%, 56.86%, and 68.89% of the entire seed bank in Zones A, B, C, and D, respectively. This research can promote to instruct and inform management practices in wetland protection, wetland management, and restoration and reconstruction in damaged wetlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Park, J; Park, J				Park, Jungjae; Park, Jina			Pollen-based temperature reconstructions from Jeju island, South Korea and its implication for coastal climate of East Asia during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We derived statistically robust, Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) transfer functions using modern surface pollen samples from Mt. Halla in Jeju Island, Korea. Pollen-based temperature reconstructions were performed by applying the best transfer function to lake sediments from Hanon maar paleolake in the southern part of Jeju Island. These quantitatively reconstructed temperatures were thereafter adjusted for the lack of warm analogue with the aid of Japanese and Russian transfer functions. Our temperature reconstructions demonstrated that annual mean temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were similar to 8.5 degrees C, i.e., about 8 degrees C lower than the present, and that the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling amplitude was similar to 1.5 degrees C between Bolling-Allerod (BA) (similar to 113 degrees C) and YD (similar to 9.8 degrees C). Spectral and wavelet analyses on detrended paleotemperatures identified significant periodicities at 1340 years, primarily after 13,000 cal yr BP. The influence of Antarctic deglacial climate on the western North Pacific probably decreased with increasing northern latitude, as expected. Our results and Borneo oxygen isotope data showed very high correlation, indicating that Jeju Island was substantially influenced by the deglacial variabilities of the western Pacific warm pool via the Kuroshio Current. The climate of the study area seemed to have been mainly controlled by variation in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) before the beginning of the last deglaciation and subsequently by variation in the Western Tropical Pacific (WTP) Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We present significant information on the correlation of the late Pleistocene climate change with the Greenland oxygen isotope data and western North Pacific SST records. This correlation bridges the gap between terrestrial records, which mostly show AMOC variability, and oceanic records, which show WTP variability. These study results will increase our understanding of regional-scale climate change during the late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Berg, HE; BenDor, TK				Berg, Hannah E.; BenDor, Todd K.			A Case Study of Form-Based Solutions for Watershed Protection	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Despite an array of policies at the federal and state level aimed at regulating stormwater discharges, engineered solutions enforced by local governments often fall short of meeting water quality standards. Although the implications of land use planning and development regulations are important for stormwater management, they are often overlooked as critical initial steps to improving water quality. This study explores the role of 'form-based' regulations as tools for achieving urban planning and water quality objectives. Form-based codes are a new generation of development codes aimed at regulating urban development based on urban form and density, rather than land use. We present an exploratory case study of the feasibility of form-based codes in the Jordan Lake Watershed in North Carolina, a rapidly growing region where fragmented local governments face stringent nutrient reduction standards under new state regulations. Through program analysis and interviews, we explore the viability of form-based codes for reducing development impacts on Jordan Lake's water quality. We consider the legal feasibility of code enforcement, regional and local barriers and opportunities, and implementation given existing regulatory frameworks. Our findings suggest that high quality information and data modeling are foundational to gaining support for a consensus agreement on the sources and degree of water quality impairment. Furthermore, implementing form-based solutions for water quality is greatly aided by (1) experienced regional planning bodies that have regulatory authority, and (2) local governments whose staff are experienced in implementing complex development ordinances, reviewing architectural renderings, and communicating development requirements with the public and developers.

Based on studies of annual nutrient loading, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen has been hypothesized to underlie these changes. The water chemistry data are consistent with this hypothesis. Specific loading rates are 0.032 +/- 0.004 yr(-1) for total nitrogen (TN) and 0.022+/-0.005 yr(-1) for total phosphorus (TP). Bounds for the doubling times of the TN pool and the TN:TP ratio demonstrate that loading is fast enough to cause the observed changes. Based on cross-sectional studies of nutrient loss rates at other lakes, the doubling time for the TN pool was estimated as 52 yr and the doubling time for TN:TP as 30 yr. In the absence of atmospheric sources, the doubling time for TN would have been 220 yr and the TN:TP ratio would have halved in 150 yr. Long-term series for nitrate and total acid-hydrolyzable phosphorus exhibit, at best, only weak trends, but interannual variability is large enough to disguise trends of the expected magnitude. Much of the year-to-year variability in nitrate is due to the variable depth of spring mixing. One possible consequence of a shift in nutrient limitation is a reversal of eutrophication, although such a reversal has not been observed to date for Lake Tahoe. Mountain lakes near urban or agricultural areas have characteristics predisposing them to the enrichment effects of atmospheric deposition.																			0003-9136					NOV	1995	135	1					1	21																WOS:A1995TJ57300001

Nocturnal vertical migrations of the mysids were monitored with both echosounder tracings and vertical net tows. Estimates of the total area dry mass of the mysids ranged from 600-1820 mg m-2. Rates of release of dissolved reactive P, total P, NH3 and urea were measured in dark incubations on shipboard. Excretion experiments were initiated immediately after mysids were collected from each of several vertical net hauls. The depths of maximum mysid densities corresponded approximately with a deep phytoplankton peak located in the vicinity of the thermocline. Semiquantitative demands for N and P by phytoplankton within this peak were obtained from 14C estimates of primary production from a previous study, assuming a constant C:N:P ratio for the algae. These algal nutrient demands were compared to potential N and P release by the mysids to obtain a 1st approximation of the relative rates of nutrient supply and demand for the field phytoplankton populations. Mysids may directly supply about 1-10% of the daily N and P demands of the phytoplankton in the deep peak. Indirect interactions between M. relicta and other organisms, such as small zooplankton and fishes, could be major factors in nutrient recycling within the metalimnion and subthermocline region of Lake Michigan.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	93	1-2					145	154		10.1007/BF00008107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008107													WOS:A1982PH64800016

Fifty-two water samples were collected from all water resources in Siwa Oasis and analyzed for physical (pH, T degrees C, EC, and TDS) chemical (SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-, Cl-, CO32-, SiO2, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+, and K+), and trace metals (AL, Fe, Sr, Ba, B, and Mn). A digital elevation model supported by machine learning was used to predict the change in the land cover (surface lake area, soil salinity, and water logging) and its effect on water quality deterioration. The groundwater circulation and interaction between the deep aquifer (NSSA) and shallow aquifer (TCA) were detected from the pressure-depth profile of 27 production wells penetrating NSSA. The chemical facies evolution in the aquifer systems were (Ca-Mg-HCO3) in the first stage (freshwater of NSSA) and changed to (Na-Cl) type in the last stage (brackish water of TCA and springs). Support vector machine successfully predicted the rapid increase of the hypersaline lake area from 22.6 km(2) to 60.6 km(2) within 30 years, which deteriorated a large part of the cultivated land, reflecting the environmental risk of over-extraction of water for irrigation of agricultural land by flooding technique and lack of suitable drainage network. The waterlogging in the study was due to a reduction in the infiltration rate (low permeability) of the soil and quaternary aquifer. The cause of this issue could be a complete saturation of agricultural water with chrysotile, calcite, talc, dolomite, gibbsite, chlorite, Ca-montmorillonite, illite, hematite, kaolinite and K-mica (saturation index >1), giving the chance of these minerals to precipitate in the pore spaces of the soil and decrease the infiltration rate. The NSSA is appropriate for irrigation, whereas TCA is inappropriate due to potential salinity and magnesium risks. The best way to manage water resources in Siwa Oasis could be to use underground drip irrigation and combine water with TCA and NSSA.					; El-Sherbeeny, Ahmed/JAC-4391-2023; Abukhadra, Mostafa/Q-3804-2018; Eissa, Mustafa/AFV-8071-2022; Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/HSF-4759-2023; Abukhadra, Mostafa R./Q-3804-2018; Shebl, Ali/ABA-7803-2021; Fahil, Amr/HLX-8446-2023	Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/0000-0002-3383-1826; Abukhadra, Mostafa R./0000-0001-5404-7996; 														2405-8440				JUN 30	2024	10	12							e32992	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32992		JUN 2024						39022055					WOS:001260286600001

Multirotors are particularly versatile platforms which offer some clear advantages for marine-based research missions including mapping and surveying of coastal, glacial, or marine features, photogrammetry, remote atmospheric or water sample collection, specimen tracking, and rare-event monitoring. The Olin College Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory has been actively developing on multirotor platforms to autonomously perform these missions, with special focus on photogrammetric and breath condensate sample collection from cetaceans. A critical part of our work is the design of an intelligent controller which will allow the multirotor to land on the deck of a research vessel or vessel of opportunity following the completion of a mission. A central control computer that may be located on the vessel will call the multirotor to return to the research vessel's deck, which has continued to travel during the mission. A global positioning system (GPS) attached to a specialized platform on the deck of the boat provides the current position of the landing platform to the multirotor. Once the multirotor arrives above the perceived location of the landing platform, a downward facing camera mounted onto the vehicle is used to identify a fiducial element that is located on the platform. Using the fiducial element and known state of the vehicle, a visual surveying methodology is used to allow the vehicle to land accurately on the specialized landing platform. Unlike in most simulated or controlled environments, the deck of a vessel of opportunity can move unpredictably in 5 axes (roll, pitch, yaw, longitudinal, latitudinal) due to oceanic characteristics and weather conditions. At present, trained multirotor pilots are the standard for controlling air vehicles, especially under these conditions. The scalability, risk, and cost of using a highly skilled human pilot limits the usefulness of these platforms in large-scale research missions. We are aiming to minimize the cost and risk associated with these platforms by making them accessible to untrained pilots as well as allowing for use of multiple platforms at one time and allowing for easy design of missions that the vehicle can conduct semi-supervised. Beyond obvious physical changes to the multirotor, including reinforcing structures or waterproofing, the multirotor itself must behave adaptively and sensitively to its environment. Our multirotors are equipped with the open hardware/software PixHawk autopilot system, which automatically rejects small environmental disturbances and provides telemetry data, such as GPS position and state of the vehicle which we use for our controller. A camera mounted to a stabilizing gimbal at the nose of the multirotor captures HD images, and a wireless video link transmits these images and the data from the autopilot to the vessel-mounted computer for processing. Our landing platform is also equipped with a GPS and streams information to the central computer. Two types of error are calculated by the computer: macro-error and micro-error. Macro-error refers to the gross positions of the landing platform and the vehicle using GPS signals. Microerror refers to the position of the vehicle in reference to the position of the landing platform fiducial element. These are used to determine the appropriate thrust and directional vectors to give to the vehicle to make a successful landing. In Spring of 2016, we implemented successful fiducial identification using computer vision techniques which extract vehicle state and image information to determine relative location of the vehicle to a known fiducial. Using this, we have developed a preliminary controller which allows for station-keeping of the vehicle above an identified fiducial on the ground. In the Summer of 2016, we will continue to develop the control scheme for fiducial identification, vehicle navigation, and landing procedure through field tests at locations including Buzzards Bay, Lake Waban, and the Gloucester Harbor. Our technology depends upon, and is itself, open-source. This allows for rapid iteration of controller design and means that what we develop can be made widely available to the marineresearch community for immediate use or customization. By putting these powerful tools in the hands of marine researchers, the need for completing missions manually can be eliminated. Landing on a vessel of opportunity is a significant step towards fully autonomous aerial instrumentation for marine-based research.

A revised chronology for the growth and demise of Loch Lomond Readvance ('Younger Dryas') ice lobes in the Lochaber area, Scotland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a revised varve chronology for the duration of ice-dammed lakes that formed in the Lochaber district, Scotland, during the Loch Lomond ('Younger Dryas') Stadial. We analysed new varved sequences and combined them with existing varve records to develop the Lochaber Master Varve Chronology 2019 (LMVC19), published here for the first time. It spans an interval of 518 +/- 18 vyrs and is considered more secure than its predecessors because: (i) it is anchored by a more robust record of the Vedde Ash, which is dated to 12,043 +/- 43 cal yr BP; and (ii) it provides revised estimates of the timings of key regional palaeoclimatic shifts that are fully compatible with those inferred from independently-dated, non-varved records obtained from neighbouring sites. The new results indicate that the Lochaber ice-dammed lakes existed between similar to 12,135 and 11,618 +/- 61 cal yr BP, but the pattern of glacier advance that led to lake formation was more complex than previously assumed, with some ice fronts reaching their maximal positions 300 years before others. Initiation of ice retreat at similar to 11,800 cal yr BP appears to have coincided with a rise of similar to 2 degrees C in mean July temperatures inferred from chironomid data obtained from the Abernethy Forest site in the eastern Highlands. This local climatic shift is thought to have been a delayed response (by up to 335 years) to a mid-Stadial northward migration of the North Atlantic Polar Front, the delay probably due to the influence of the SW Highland icefleld. Subsequent retreat that led to the formation of ice stagnation features throughout large parts of the area was initiated by a further rise in summer air temperature of similar to 3 degrees C at the start of the Early Holocene. Final drainage of the lake system occurred similar to 190 years after the initiation of ice retreat, while it took a further 200 years for the ice to vacate the Rannoch plateau, a nearby upland glacial source.

J	Sand-Jensen, K; Frost-Christensen, H				Sand-Jensen, K; Frost-Christensen, H			Photosynthesis of amphibious and obligately submerged plants in CO2-rich lowland streams	OECOLOGIA												Small unshaded streams in lowland regions receive drainage water with high concentrations of free CO2, and they support an abundant growth of amphibious and obligately submerged plants. Our first objective was to measure the CO2 regime during summer in a wide range of small alkaline Danish streams subject to wide variation in temperature, O-2 and CO2 during the day. The second objective was to determine the effect of these variations on daily changes in light-saturated photosynthesis in water of a homophyllous and a heterophyllous amphibious species that only used CO2, and an obligately submerged species capable of using both HCO2 and CO2. We found that the median CO2 concentrations of the streams were 11 and 6 times above air saturation in the morning and the afternoon, respectively, but stream sites with dense plant growth had CO2 concentrations approaching air saturation in the afternoon. In contrast, outlets from lakes had low CO2 concentrations close to, or below, air saturation. The amphibious species showed a reduction of photosynthesis in water from morning to afternoon along with the decline in CO2 concentrations, while increasing temperature and O-2 had little effect on photosynthesis. Photosynthesis of the obligately submerged species varied little with the change of CO2 because of HCO3- use, and variations were mostly due to changes in O-2 concentration. Independent measurements showed that changes in temperature, O-2 and CO2 could account for the daily variability of photosynthesis of all three species in water. The results imply that CO2 supersaturation in small lowland streams is important for the rich representation of amphibious species and their contribution to system photosynthesis.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Field experiments were conducted in early summer 2004 by caging brown trout (Salmo trutta m. lacustris) in Southern Lake Saimaa (SE Finland) for 10 days. Cages were positioned into two depths at four distances (5 to 17 km) from the pulp and paper mill; one set with direct contact to the sediment and other locating at the three meters' depth from the water surface. Resin acids were measured from sediment, water, and fish bile. Possible toxicities were investigated by measuring liver EROD-activity, HSP70-protein, and gene expression profiles by microarray. The concentration of resin acids in the sediment showed clear gradient along the distance from the mill, and their concentrations in water ranged approximately from one to 30 mu g L(-1). In the trout bile, concentrations were higher near the surface than on the bottom, indicating the role of current releases as sources of resin acids. When compared to trout held upstream from the effluent source, no differences were found in liver EROD nor HSP70 in bottom cages. However, near surface, a slight but statistically significant increase in EROD and HSP70 was found. Altogether 145 genes were found to be differentially regulated at downstream sites when compared -10 km upstream from the mill. The numbers of genes at each site varied from 5 to 45 without consistent differences between bottom and surface cages. Overall, neither expression profiles nor composition of the transcription signatures made possible to conclude an overt toxicity in exposed brown trout.					; Afanasyev, Sergey/K-9309-2015	Merilainen, Paivi/0000-0002-7457-757X; Afanasyev, Sergey/0000-0002-8393-820X													1464-0325						2010	12	5					1045	1054		10.1039/b922532c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b922532c								21491625					WOS:000277690100004

Highest pair densities were observed in June 1992 oil rivers located in tundra and forest tundra i.e., the lower Little Whale, A l'Eau Claire and Nastapoka Rivers, and near D'Iberville Lake. In 1992, pair densities varied between 0.003 and 0.093 pair/km, depending oil the watershed, and followed a latitudinal gradient. Two broods were located in 1991 and three were found during a preliminary survey conducted in 1989. Broods were located on Boutin, Nastapoka, and Great Whale Rivers, as well as along the Hudson Bay coast. The difference in the number of Harlequin Ducks found in June 1991 and 1992 may have been related to weather and methodological factors. Considering the vastness of northern Quebec and the limited area Surveyed during this study, we Suggest that Harlequin Ducks breeding in northern Quebec may well number in the thousands, and represent a very high proportion of the Greenland molting and wintering populations.																			1524-4695						2008	31						110	121																WOS:000263006600016
J	Havens, KE; Gawlik, DE				Havens, KE; Gawlik, DE			Lake Okeechobee conceptual ecological model	WETLANDS												With a surface area of nearly 1,800 square kilometers, Lake Okeechobee is a prominent central feature of the South Florida aquatic ecosystem. The lake provides regional flood protection, supports a prized recreational fishery, provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and regional wading bird populations, and is a source of fresh water for irrigation, drinking, and restoration of downstream ecosystems. The main stressors on Lake Okeechobee are (1) large inputs of phosphorus from agricultural and other anthropogenic land uses in the watershed, (2) unnatural variation in water levels due to channelization of inflows and dike containment, and (3) rapid expansion of non-native plants. Ecological effects are complicated due to three distinct in-lake zones with different water chemistry, physical properties, and biota. A central pelagic zone has turbid, nutrient-rich water and phytoplankton dominance; a shallow south and western near-shore zone has submerged plant or phytoplankton dominance (at low vs. high water levels, respectively); and a western littoral zone is dominated by emergent wetland plants. Changes in water level influence the flow of nutrients between zones, thereby creating a synergistic effect between stressors. Under high water conditions, there is considerable advective transport of nutrients from the pelagic zone into the littoral zone. Under low water conditions, the littoral zone is cut off hydrologically and is a rainfall-driven oligotrophic wetland. Low water also facilitates drying and wildfires in the littoral zone, which in turn has an influence on expansion of non-native plants and recovery of native plants from buried seed banks. All of these factors influence fish, wading birds, and other animals, which depend on littoral and near-shore plant communities for nesting and foraging habitat. This paper describes our current knowledge of these complex processes, the lake's expected responses to ongoing and planned restoration programs, and key areas of uncertainty requiring future research.

J	Budd, JW				Budd, JW			Large-scale transport phenomena in the Keweenaw Region of Lake Superior: The Ontonagon Plume and the Keweenaw Eddy	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Large-scale transport phenomena in the Keweenaw region of Lake Superior are examined using multi-sensor satellite remote sensing. Satellite-based estimates of chlorophyll a (C-OC2) and total suspended matter (TSMSAT) concentrations are obtained from Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, while lake surface temperatures (LST) are obtained from, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Analysis of 2 years of temperature, chlorophyll, and sediment maps reveal several potentially important features in central Lake Superior. SeaWiFS TSMSAT images indicate the presence of an offshore sediment plume originating near Ontonagon, Michigan that was observed on multiple occasions in March, April, and May of both years. Plume materials were observed northeastward of Ontonagon at distances of 80-100 km off shore, although reversals in the pattern were observed. During summer months, the Keweenaw current culminated in a clockwise rotating eddy east of the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The Keweenaw eddy, identified in both A VHRR LST and Sea WiFS C-OC2 Maps, was 50-75 km in diameter, and it changed shape and location during July, August, and September of both years. In August and September 1999, warm waters originating near the southern shore of Isle Royale and in central Lake Superior extended in a southeasterly direction toward the tip of the Keweenaw and were subsequently entrained in the Keweenaw eddy. The physical mechanisms that create the eddy and its potential biological significance for lower trophic food web interactions are not understood at this time.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			467	480		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70407-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70407-4													WOS:000227991500035

Effects of Gizzard Shad Reduction on Relative Abundance, Growth, and Body Condition of Bluegills and Largemouth Bass in a Small Kansas Impoundment	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum are commonly manipulated as a prey species in the United States but are widely viewed as undesirable in small impoundments because of direct and indirect effects on desirable sport fishes. Montgomery State Fishing Lake in southeastern Kansas became populated with Gizzard Shad during a flood event in 2007, and subsequent monitoring efforts indicated the Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus population was negatively affected. Remedial action involving reservoir dewatering and application of rotenone (target concentration of 7.5g/L) was conducted during the winter of 2013-2014, and responses of Bluegills and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides were monitored for 3years posttreatment. Gizzard Shad were not extirpated following treatment, but their relative abundance decreased 99.8%. Relative abundance of age-0 Bluegills and Largemouth Bass immediately increased following treatment in 2014 but decreased to pretreatment levels in 2015 and 2016. Conversely, growth of age-0 Bluegills decreased in 2014, but increased to pretreatment levels in 2015 and 2016. Growth of age-0 Largemouth Bass slightly decreased following treatment. Growth between the development of the second and third annulus did not differ among years for either species. Body condition of stock-length Bluegills and stock-length Largemouth Bass was greatest in 2012 but declined in subsequent years. These results suggest that, contrary to previously published studies, the reduction of Gizzard Shad had minimal effect on Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations in Montgomery State Fishing Lake. However, intraspecific, density-dependent functions might have masked true responses of Bluegill and Largemouth Bass growth and body condition to Gizzard Shad reduction. Managers should understand that Gizzard Shad removal or reduction can have variable effects in aquatic systems and should be cognizant of potential outcomes and how those might affect fish populations and associated fisheries.

J	Castro, H; Reddy, KR; Ogram, A				Castro, H; Reddy, KR; Ogram, A			Composition and function of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes in eutrophic and pristine areas of the Florida Everglades	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												As a result of agricultural activities in regions adjacent to the northern boundary of the Florida Everglades, a nutrient gradient developed that resulted in physicochemical and ecological changes from the original system. Sulfate input from agricultural runoff and groundwater is present in soils of the Northern Everglades, and sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) may play an important role in biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling. The goal of this project was to utilize culture-based and non-culture-based approaches to study differences between the composition of assemblages of SRP in eutrophic and pristine areas of the Everglades. Sulfate reduction rates and most-probable-number enumerations revealed SRP populations and activities to be greater in eutrophic zones than in more pristine soils. In eutrophic regions, methanogenesis rates were higher, the addition of acetate stimulated methanogenesis, and SRP able to utilize acetate competed to a limited degree with acetoclastic methanogens. A surprising amount of diversity within clone libraries of PCR-amplified dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR) genes was observed, and the majority of DSR sequences were associated with gram-positive spore-forming Desulfotomaculum and uncultured microorganisms. Sequences associated with Desulfotomaculum fall into two categories: in the eutrophic regions, 94.7% of the sequences related to Desulfotomaculum were associated with those able to completely oxidize substrates, and in samples from pristine regions, all Desulfotomaculum-like sequences were related to incomplete oxidizers. This metabolic selection may be linked to the types of substrates that Desulfotomaculum spp. utilize; it may be that complete oxidizers are. more versatile and likelier to proliferate in nutrient-rich zones of the Everglades. Desulfotomaculum incomplete oxidizers may outcompete complete oxidizers for substrates such as hydrogen in pristine zones where diverse carbon sources are less available.

Evaluating outcomes of management targeting the recovery of a migratory songbird of conservation concern	PEERJ												Background Assessing outcomes of habitat management is critical for informing and adapting conservation plans. From 2013-2019, a multi-stage management initiative, led by the American Bird Conservancy (ABC), aims to create >25,000 ha of shrubland and early-successional vegetation to benefit Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) in managed forested landscapes of the western Great Lakes region. We studied a dense breeding population of Golden-winged Warblers at Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Minnesota, USA, where ABC initiative management was implemented to benefit the species. Methods We monitored abundance before (2011-2014) and after (2015-2016) management, and we estimated full-season productivity (i.e., young recruited into the fall population) from predictive, spatially explicit models, informed by nest and fledgling survival data collected at sites in the western Great Lakes region, including Rice Lake NWR, during 2011 and 2012. Then, using biologically informed models of bird response to observed and predicted vegetation succession, we estimated the cumulative change in population recruitment over various scenarios of vegetation succession and demographic response. Results We observed an 32% decline in abundance of breeding pairs and estimated a 27% decline in per-pair full-season productivity following management, compared to no change in a nearby control site. In models that ranged from highly optimistic to progressively more realistic scenarios, we estimated a net loss of 72-460 juvenile Golden-winged Warblers produced from the managed site in the 10-20 years following management. Even if our well-informed and locally validated productivity models produced erroneous estimates and the management resulted in only a temporary reduction in abundance (i.e., no change in productivity), our forecast models still predicted a net loss of 137-260 juvenile Golden-winged Warblers from the managed area over the same time frame. Conclusions Our study site represents only a small portion of a massive management initiative; however, the management at our site was conducted in accordance with the initiatives management plans, the resulting vegetation structure is consistent with that of other areas managed under the initiative, and those responsible for the initiative have described the management at our study site as successful Golden-winged Warbler management. Our assessment demonstrates that, at least for the only site for which pre- and post-management data on Golden-winged Warblers exist, the ABC management initiative is having a substantial and likely enduring negative impact on the species it purports to benefit. We suggest that incorporating region-specific, empirical information about Golden-winged Warblerhabitat relations into habitat management efforts would increase the likelihood of a positive response by Golden-winged Warblers.

Differential hypoxia tolerance of eastern oysters from the northern Gulf of Mexico at elevated temperature	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Increasing prevalence of hypoxia in shallow waters of U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) estuaries can pose a serious threat to eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica). Their tolerance to hypoxia, however, is not well characterized, especially at elevated temperatures (>30 degrees C) typical of GoM estuaries in summer. Moreover, it is unknown whether differences in hypoxia tolerance exist between GoM oyster populations growing in estuaries differing in local environmental conditions. Wild oyster broodstocks were collected from four estuarine sites in Texas (Packery Channel, PC and Aransas Bay, AB) and Louisiana (Calcasieu Lake, CL and Vermilion Bay, VB) and their adult progenies (F1) were tested (Study 1) under continuous hypoxia (<2.0 mg O-2 L-1) at 32 degrees C. Significant differences in hypoxia tolerance were found between F1 populations with calculated median lethal time (LT50) ranging from 3.9 to 12.5 days. PC and CL oysters were the most and least tolerant populations, respectively. The study was repeated twice more (Studies 2 and 3) using PC and CL oysters, and their responses at the organismic, cellular, and biochemical levels were investigated. Valve movement was monitored, and oysters were sampled to measure hemocyte density, plasma protein, calcium and glutathione concentrations, and digestive gland alanine and succinate concentrations after either 3-5 days (Study 2) or 1-3 days (Study 3) of hypoxia exposure. From the onset of hypoxia until their death, oysters stayed opened 13-32% of the time compared to 53-64% under normoxia, but no differences between populations were detected under hypoxia. PC oyster but not CL oyster plasma glutathione concentrations increased significantly in both studies. Under longer (3-5 days) hypoxia exposure, plasma calcium and glutathione concentrations of PC oysters were significantly higher than CL oysters. These results suggest PC oysters were better able to protect tissues against acidosis and oxidative damage during hypoxia and high temperature stress than CL oysters. Overall, our results indicate that oyster populations originating from the GoM vary in their response to hypoxia and high temperature stress and possess differential tolerance.

J	Miyabuchi, Y; Ikebe, S; Watanabe, K				Miyabuchi, Yasuo; Ikebe, Shin-ichiro; Watanabe, Kazunori			Geological constraints on the 2003-2005 ash emissions from the Nakadake crater lake, Aso Volcano, Japan	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The active crater of Nakadake at Aso Volcano, southwestern Japan, has been occupied by a lake during its dormant periods. Multiple ash emissions were observed from the crater lake between July 2003 and August 2005. The largest events occurred on 10 July 2003 and 14 January 2004. On 10 July 2003, ash (41 tons) was dispersed throughout an area extending 14 km east-northeast of the vent, and on 14 January 2004 ash (32 tons) extended 8 km to the east-southeast. Thereafter, small ash emissions were frequent at the crater lake, in which the water level fell considerably from April to August 2005. During this period major ash emitting events, producing mostly white aggregated ash, occurred on June 10-12, June 21 (4.2 tons) and July 25 (1.2 tons). Ash emissions at the Nakadake crater in 2003-2005 were classified into three types: gentle release of white aggregated ash from fumaroles inside the crater lake (e.g. daytime of 14 April, 10-12 June and 25 July 2005); emission of black ash from an almost dried-up vent (21 June 2005); and short-time (ca. 20 s) small-explosion-triggered gas-and-ash emission through the crater lake (10 July 2003, 14 January 2004 and 14 April 20h41 m 2005). All products from these ash emissions consisted of fine-grained (< 1 mm) glass shards, crystals and lithic fragments, and contained neither lapilli nor blocks. Although the glass shards show varying degrees of crystallization and alteration, clear glass shards, which appear fresh, are probably juvenile materials. These observations suggest that the 2003-2005 ash emissions from the crater lake of Nakadake Volcano are related to newly ascending magma. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bai, ZD; Zhang, JK; Shi, ZW; Li, TY				Bai ZhiDa; Zhang JinKui; Shi ZhiWei; Li TianYuan			Preliminary study on Quaternary volcanic cluster in Huitengxile, central Inner Mongolia	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA												Huitengxile volcanic cluster is located at the junction of Zhuozi County, Chahar Right-Middle and Right-Back Banners, central Inner Mongolia, situated in the alpine grassland area. It belongs to the southern part of the Quaternary volcanic eruption belt of Datong-Arxan-Nuomin River in the east of China. The volcanic cluster is located on the Archean metamorphic rock series, Permian granites and Neogene Hannuoba basalts. On the plane, it is a low-lying diamond platform surrounded by mountains, with an area about 260 km(2). Because it is superimposed on Hannuoba basalt platform, it was mistakenly classified as Neogene Hannuoba basalt in the past. There are above 100 volcanoes in the volcanic cluster, most of which are basically intact. The volcanic products are mainly alkaline olivine basalts, followed by pyroclastic materials (rocks) of different genesis. The alkaline basalts are overlying the Late Pleistocene slope deposits and loess. The volcanic activity is mainly in the Late Pleistocene, which can be further divided into three stages:early, middle and late. In the early stage, it was fissure-central eruption, and the crater had been denuded completely. In the middle stage, it mainly formed "Dichi-type" and Maar-type volcanoes, with relatively complete volcanic morphology. The craters were characterized by round or oval shapes, most of which accumulated water into lakes, commonly known as "ninety-nine eye springs" or "Haizi". In the late stage, lava overflowed and formed shield volcanoes with complete structures. The volcanic activity has experienced the evolution process of extrusive, center-type weak eruption and overflow, phreatomagmatic eruption, overflow and then sputtering along the fractures. Huitengxile volcanic cluster is a Quaternary volcanic cluster newly disintegrated on the Hannuoba basalt platform of Neogene, which provides another natural window for the study of the deep crustal structure and its activity in the south of the Mongolian Plateau, and has important theoretical and practical significance for studying neotectonics, environment and disaster warning.

J	Catling, PM; Brownell, VR				Catling, PM; Brownell, VR			An objective classification of Ontario plateau alvars in the northern portion of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone and a consideration of protection frameworks	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												To develop an alvar classification system based on grouping criteria generated by data analysis and to apply the system in an evaluation of existing protection frameworks, species lists for 57 Ontario alvars were used to analyze the relationship between sites based on a UPGMA clustering of Jaccard's coefficients. A principal coordinate analysis was used to complimentarily reduce the dimensionality of the data, and this analysis also provided the coordinate axes used to assess available protection frameworks. The sites were classified into nine groups including three major groups and their subgroups: (1) the Smiths Falls, Napanee, and Garden plains all of which were quite distinct, (2) the Bend Bay and Trent River sites which are predominantly alvar savannas lacking some of the characteristic open alvar communities such as pavements, and (3) the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island region which may be divided into three major subgroups. The floristic basis for the classification is outlined. In the absence of biological data, a geographic framework proved to be the most useful. Classification of sites based on physiographic and climatic regions also proved useful, but the results suggested that strict adherance to arbitrary divisions not supported by analyzed data could lead to substantial gaps within a system of representative protected sites.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1999	113	4					569	575																WOS:000084720700002
J	Li, N; Yang, B; Huang, TL; Si, F; Gao, Y; Zhao, LY				Li, Nan; Yang, Bin; Huang, Tinglin; Si, Fan; Gao, Yue; Zhao, Lingyun			Hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment oxygen demand during stratification in a drinking water reservoir	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose Although hypolimnetic anoxia is a common occurrence in deep lakes and reservoirs, understanding the processes of oxygen depletion in water columns and sediment is challenging. This study investigates oxygen depletion in both the hypolimnion and sediments in a stratified reservoir. The areal hypolimnetic oxygen demand (AHOD) and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were evaluated to determine key factors of hypolimnetic anoxia. Materials and methods To evaluate the characteristics of the AHOD in the Jinpen Reservoir (JPR), China, 4 years of field observations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature datasets in the water column are analyzed. SOD was calculated as the sum of the sediment oxygen uptake (J(O2)) and the flux of reduced substances from deeper sediment layers into the overlying water (F-red), where J(O2) was obtained from DO profiles across the sediment-water interface (SWI) at a depth of approximately 94 m in the reservoir, and F-red was obtained from sediment cores. Results The AHOD in the JPR varied from 0.299 to 1.451 g m(-2) day(-1) during the summer stratification between 2014 and 2017. The SOD, containing J(O2) and F-red, decreased from 0.534 to 0.386 g m(-2) day(-1) during stratification. Within the SOD, J(O2) decreased from 0.415 to 0.168 g m(-2) day(-1), whereas F-red increased from 0.119 to 0.218 g m(-2) day(-1). Conclusion The increase in primary productivity (e.g., diatom blooms), inflows during rainfall, and oxygen concentrations can significantly increase AHOD. The relative importance of J(O2) at 40-70% of the SOD is high in the JPR; thus, oxic respiration of organic carbon is the dominant pathway of DO consumption.

J	Yuan, F; Miyamoto, S				Yuan, Fasong; Miyamoto, Seiichi			Characteristics of oxygen-18 and deuterium composition in waters from the Pecos River in American Southwest	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The Pecos River, situated in eastern New Mexico and western Texas, receives snowmelt from winter storms in the headwater region of the southern Rocky Mountains and runoff from warm-season monsoonal rainfall in the lower valley. The isotopic composition of the two water sources differs from each other due to their different geographical origins in the Pacific North and the Gulf of Mexico. To better assess the physical features of the Pecos River, oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta O-18 and delta D), major ion concentrations, and other physical variables (e.g., water temperature and electrical conductivity) were measured on water samples collected from the main stem and its selected tributaries during a growing season (March, May, and July) in 2005. The results of this work indicate that stream water from the Pecos River contains a relatively large magnitude of variations in delta O-18 and delta D, with delta O-18 ranging from -8.9 parts per thousand to 3.6 parts per thousand and delta D from -64.5 parts per thousand to 1.6 parts per thousand. The average value of delta O-18 is around -3 parts per thousand, which is significantly larger than that of the snowmelt but almost identical to that of the Mexican monsoonal rainfall. On the other hand, the average value of delta D is around -30 parts per thousand, which is significantly larger than that of the snowmelt but lower than that of the Mexican monsoonal rainfall. Application of a dual isotope index, deuterium excess (d-excess), allows us to assess the relative contribution of various hydrologic components and processes that shape the stream hydrology of the Pecos River. The river water from the upper valley is characterized by relatively low values of delta O-18 and delta D and relatively high: values of d-excess (d=10 parts per thousand), documenting the isotopic fingerprint of the snowmelt. The middle basin is topographically gentle and its water quality has been severely affected by anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., water impoundments and diversions). As a result, chemical and isotopic composition of the water from the middle basin is highly variable, depending on its time, location, and degree of disturbances. Both delta O-18 and delta D increase significantly from upstream to downstream and from cold to warm seasons because of evaporation-induced isotopic enrichments. The average 6180 value of the heavy-isotope-enriched waters from the middle basin is identical to that of the waters from the lower valley. In contrast, d-excess of the waters from the middle basin usually is negative, and substantially lower than that of the waters from the lower valley. Using a simple d-excess based hydrologic model, we estimated that there was up to 85% of stream flow which was derived from local freshwater sources (mainly from the Mexican monsoonal rainfall) in the lower valley and that there was up to 33% of stream water which was lost through evaporation occurring in stream channels and fields of the middle basin. Additionally, the correlation of d-excess and electrical conductivity further highlights the role of evaporative enrichments in regulating stream chemistry and isotope hydrology. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combined isotopic and geochemical data, especially the applicability of d-excess, for watershed baseline assessments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Helvaci, C				Helvaci, Cahit			Geology, mineralogy and depositional setting of the Beypazari Trona (Natural Soda) Deposit (Ankara, Turkiye)	TURKIYE JEOLOJI BULTENI-GEOLOGICAL BULLETIN OF TURKEY												The Beypazari district is a large area of volcano-sedimentary rocks in the interior of central Anatolia, situated similar to 100 km northwest of Ankara. Trona, lignite, and bituminous shale occur in the lower part, and Na-sulfate and gypsum occur in the upper part of the sedimentary sequence of the Miocene Beypazari basin. The Neogene Beypazari Basin extends in an east-west direction from Beypazari to Nallihan and consists of a sedimentary sequence of up to 1200 m total thickness. The pre-Neogene basement rock assemblages of the Pontides limits the basin to the north. The Central Sakarya Region consisting of ultrabasic, granitic and metamorphic rocks bounds the basin to the south. The trona deposit, located 250-300 m below the surface, was discovered incidentally in the summer of 1982 by the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) while carrying out a drilling project on lignite deposits. An extensive exploratory drilling program was undertaken by MTA during the period 1983-1985 on behalf of Etibank. Proven trona reserves are 210 million metric tons, and total reserves are estimated to be 240 million metric tons. The Beypazari trona deposit is the world's second largest trona deposit after the Green River deposit, Wyoming, USA. In addition, there are similar to 400 million metric tons of lignite, 340 million metric tons of bituminous shale, and 1 million metric tons of Na-sulfate in the Beypazari Basin. The trona deposit located north of Zaviye village is associated with shale in the lower part of the Hirka Formation and alternates with bituminous shale and claystones. Based on borehole data, it is estimated that the areal extent of the trona deposit is similar to 8 km(2). The trona beds were deposited as two lens-like bodies within a 70-100 m thick zone in the lower part of the shale unit. A total of 33 trona beds are known: 16 in the lower trona lens and 17 in the upper lens. The total thickness of the lower trona horizon ranges from 40 to 60 m, and the total thickness of the upper trona horizon is similar to 40 m. The interval between the lower and the upper trona horizons varies from 30 m to 35 m. The central part of the trona deposit is generally thicker than the marginal parts, and the trona beds grade laterally into dolomitic mudstones and claystones toward the edges of the basin. The total thickness of the trona beds in both lenses varies between 21 and 34 m in the central parts, and 2.5 and 12 m in the marginal parts of the ore bodies. The common thickness of the individual trona beds in both trona horizons ranges from 0.4 m to 2 m. The isopach contours of both trona horizons are restricted by the Zaviye fault. The principal sodium-carbonate minerals are trona and minor nahcolite occurring in the marginal parts of the trona deposits, and trace amounts of pirssonite and thermonatrite occur locally. Trona and dolomite are associated throughout the trona zone. Calcite, zeolites, feldspars, and clays are the most common minerals within the rocks associated with the trona deposit. Trona crystals, generally white and occasionally grayish due to the presence of impurities, formed as massive crystals and as disseminated crystals in the claystone and shales. The products of zeolitization, dolomitization, and chloritization are rather widespread within the rock units associated with trona. The Beypazari Basin was affected by an extensional tectonic regime during the Middle-Late Miocene period. This extensional regime converted to a unidirectional compressional regime during the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene period. The sediments associated with the trona, lignite, and bituminous-shale deposits formed in fluvial, lacustrine, and playa-lake (perennial and ephemeral) environments. The Beypazari Basin is mainly filled by clastic materials and the penecontemporaneous products of adjacent volcanic activity, centered northeast of the basin. The most likely sources of Na for the formation of trona and other sodium-carbonate salts were thermal springs, tuffs interbedded with the sediments, and extensive Neogene volcanic rocks interfingering with sedimentary rocks in the northeastern part of the basin.																			1016-9164					MAY	2025	68				SI		69	84		10.25288/tjb.1491266	http://dx.doi.org/10.25288/tjb.1491266													WOS:001543262100004

Unexpected population response to increasing temperature in the context of a strong species interaction	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Climate change is driving large changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of species, with significant consequences for individual populations. Community-and ecosystem-level implications of altered species distributions may be complex and challenging to anticipate due to the cascading effects of disrupted interactions among species, which may exhibit threshold responses to extreme climatic events. Toxic, bloom-forming cyanobacteria like Microcystis are expected to increase worldwide with climate change, due in part to their high temperature optima for growth. In addition, invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have caused an increase in Microcystis aeruginosa, a species typically associated with eutrophication, in low-nutrient lakes. We conducted a 13-yr study of a M. aeruginosa population in a low-nutrient lake invaded by zebra mussels. In 10 of the 13 years, there was a significant positive relationship between M. aeruginosa biomass and accumulated degree days, which are projected to increase with climate change. In contrast, Microcystis biomass was up to an order of magnitude lower than predicted by the above relationship during the other three years, including the warmest in the data set, following repeated heat-induced mass mortality of D. polymorpha. Thus, the positive relationship between Microcystis biomass and temperature was negated when its facilitating species was suppressed during a series of exceptionally warm summers. Predicting the net response of a species to climate change may therefore require, at minimum, quantification of responses of both the focal species and species that strongly interact with it over sufficiently long time periods to encompass the full range of climatic variability. Our results could not have been predicted from existing data on the short-term responses of these two interacting species to increased temperature.

The population structure of Escherichia coli isolated from subtropical and temperate soils	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												While genotypically-distinct naturalized Escherichia coli strains have been shown to occur in riparian soils of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior watersheds, comparative analyses of E. coli populations in diverse soils across a range of geographic and climatic conditions have not been investigated. The main objectives of this study were to: (a) examine the population structure and genetic relatedness of E. coli isolates collected from different soil types on a tropical island (Hawaii), and (b) determine if E. coli populations from Hawaii and temperate soils (Indiana, Minnesota) shared similar genotypes that may be reflective of biome-related soil conditions. DNA fingerprint and multivariate statistical analyses were used to examine the population structure and genotypic characteristics of the E. coli isolates. About 33% (98 of 293) of the E. coli from different soil types and locations on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, had unique DNA fingerprints, indicating that these bacteria were relatively diverse; the Shannon diversity index for the population was 4.03. Nearly 60% (171 of 293) of the E. coli isolates from Hawaii clustered into two major groups and the rest, with two or more isolates, fell into one of 22 smaller groups, or individual lineages. Multivariate analysis of variance of 89, 21, and 106 unique E. coli DNA fingerprints for Hawaii, Indiana, and Minnesota soils, respectively, showed that isolates formed tight cohesive groups, clustering mainly by location. However, there were several instances of clonal isolates being shared between geographically different locations. Thus, while nearly identical E. coli strains were shared between disparate climatologically- and geographically-distinct locations, a vast majority of the soil E. coli strains were genotypically diverse and were likely derived from separate lineages. This supports the hypothesis that these bacteria are not unique and multiple genotypes can readily adapt to become part of the soil autochthonous microflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Stal, LJ; Moezelaar, R				Stal, LJ; Moezelaar, R			Fermentation in cyanobacteria	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS												Although cyanobacteria are oxygenic phototrophic organisms, they often thrive in environments that become periodically anoxic. This is particularly the case in the dark when photosynthetic oxygen evolution does not take place. Whereas cyanobacteria generally utilize endogenous storage carbohydrate by aerobic respiration, they must use alternative ways for energy generation under dark anoxic conditions. This aspect of metabolism of cyanobacteria has received little attention but nevertheless in recent years a steadily increasing number of publications have reported the capacity of fermentation in cyanobacteria. This review summarizes these reports and gives a critical consideration of the energetics of dark fermentation in a number of species. There are a variety of different fermentation pathways in cyanobacteria. These include home-and heterolactic acid fermentation, mixed acid fermentation and homoacetate fermentation, Products of fermentation include CO2, H-2, formate, acetate, lactate and ethanol. In all species investigated, fermentation is constitutive. All enzymes of the fermentative pathways are present in photoautotrophically grown cells. Many cyanobacteria are also capable of using elemental sulfur as electron acceptor. In most cases it seems unlikely that sulfur respiration occurs, The main advantage of sulfur reduction seems to be the higher yield of ATP which can be achieved during fermentation. Besides oxygen and elemental sulfur no other electron accepters for chemotrophic metabolism are known so far in cyanobacteria. Calculations show that the yield of ATP during fermentation, although it is low relative to aerobic respiration, exceeds the amount that is likely to be required for maintenance, which appears to be very low in these cyanobacteria. The possibility of a limited amount of biosynthesis during anaerobic dark metabolism is discussed.

J	Brink, R; Mehrtens, C; Maguire, H				Brink, Ryan; Mehrtens, Charlotte; Maguire, Henry			Sedimentology and petrography of a lower Cambrian transgressive sequence: Altona Formation (Potsdam Group) in northeastern New York	BULLETIN OF GEOSCIENCES												The Altona Formation, the oldest unit in Potsdam Group, is a heterolithic shallow marine deposit recording fair weather and storm deposition in a marginal marine setting associated with the onlap of the Laurentian Craton in the latest early Cambrian (Olenellus Zone) to middle middle Cambrian (Bathyuriscus-Elrathina Zone). Six lithofacies are recognized within the Altona Formation including non-marine sheet flood, nearshore bay/estuary, and upper and middle shoreface. These lithofacies occur in the stratigraphy in response to relative sea level change and sediment supply. Onlap of Precambrian Grenville basement represents initial transgressive systems tract deposition which was succeeded by highstand deposition, and with it, diminished terrigenous input and the onset of carbonate deposition. Renewed input of terrigenous sand in the upper third of the Altona resulted in shoreline progradation followed by a second cycle of transgressive and highstand systems tract deposition. The overlying Ausable Formation marks the transition to falling sea level and onset of non-marine deposition. Analysis of gamma ray log data confirms that terrigenous sediment input varied through the stratigraphy, which is interpreted as a response to rising sea level trapping sediment on the coastal plain. Predominantly compositionally immature sandstone, the Altona also contains arenaceous dolostone, dolostone and silty shale. Modal analysis of the sandstones indicates an arkosic composition for the sandstones, with an accessory mineral suite including apatite, ilmenite, rutile, and zircon. This accessory suite, along with detrital zircon ages, indicates an Adirondack massif source rock.																			1214-1119	1802-8225					2019	94	3					369	388		10.3140/bull.geosci.1728	http://dx.doi.org/10.3140/bull.geosci.1728													WOS:000500717300006

Until now, mechanisms and long-term variations of these complex interacting climate processes have been poorly understood. This paper uses a sediment record from Lake Kalimpaa to investigate long-term rainfall trends of the past similar to 1500 years. Granulometric and geochemical data provide indications for an increasingly wetter climate (higher rainfall intensities and/or mean rainfall) on centennial to millennial time scales from approximately ad 560 to the 20th century. Highest rainfall intensities probably occurred at the end of the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). The trend towards wetter conditions during this time could also be detected in other palaeoclimatic studies from the region. A plausible explanation for these observations is the southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with changes in monsoon dynamics. However, comparison of the results with other proxy and model data indicates that the long-term rainfall variability in Central Sulawesi is also determined by variations in ENSO. During the 20th century, the climate signal in the Kalimpaa record is superimposed by human impact. Moreover, the data suggest that two periods of disturbance occurred within the lake catchment between about ad 1090-1190 and ad 1450-1620. Comparison with fire frequency derived from macro-charcoal analysis indicates that these events were caused by forest fires which likely took place during periods of drought. Broadly simultaneous drought periods have been detected in records from East Java suggesting a regional drought occurrence affecting at least East Java and Sulawesi.					; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021; Wündsch, Michael/J-1939-2014; Daut, Gerhard/AAO-1514-2021	Reinwarth, Bastian/0000-0002-5322-680X; Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Daut, Gerhard/0000-0001-7414-1103													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2014	24	12					1743	1756		10.1177/0959683614551217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614551217													WOS:000346178500011
J	Clewing, C; Albrecht, C; Wilke, T				Clewing, Catharina; Albrecht, Christian; Wilke, Thomas			A Complex System of Glacial Sub-Refugia Drives Endemic Freshwater Biodiversity on the Tibetan Plateau	PLOS ONE												Although only relatively few freshwater invertebrate families are reported from the Tibetan Plateau, the degree of endemism may be high. Many endemic lineages occur within permafrost areas, raising questions about the existence of isolated intra-plateau glacial refugia. Moreover, if such refugia existed, it might be instructive to learn whether they were associated with lakes or with more dynamic ecosystems such as ponds, wetlands, or springs. To study these hypotheses, we used pulmonate snails of the plateau-wide distributed genus Radix as model group and the Lake Donggi Cona drainage system, located in the northeastern part of the plateau, as model site. First, we performed plateau-wide phylogenetic analyses using mtDNA data to assess the overall relationships of Radix populations inhabiting the Lake Donggi Cona system for revealing refugial lineages. We then conducted regional phylogeographical analyses applying a combination of mtDNA and nuclear AFLP markers to infer the local structure and demographic history of the most abundant endemic Radix clade for identifying location and type of (sub-) refugia within the drainage system. Our phylogenetic analysis showed a high diversity of Radix lineages in the Lake Donggi Cona system. Subsequent phylogeographical analyses of the most abundant endemic clade indicated a habitat-related clustering of genotypes and several Late Pleistocene spatial/demographic expansion events. The most parsimonious explanation for these patterns would be a scenario of an intra-plateau glacial refugium in the Lake Donggi Cona drainage system, which might have consisted of isolated sub-refugia. Though the underlying processes remain unknown, an initial separation of lake and watershed populations could have been triggered by lake-level fluctuations before and during the Last Glacial Maximum. This study inferred the first intra-plateau refugium for freshwater animals on the Tibetan Plateau. It thus sheds new light on the evolutionary history of its endemic taxa and provides important insights into the complex refugial history of a high-altitude ecosystem.					; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012	Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758; 													1932-6203					AUG 8	2016	11	8							e0160286	10.1371/journal.pone.0160286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160286								27500403					WOS:000381373500018

The arcuate submarine moraines have steep frontal ramparts and comprise up to 80 m of acoustically incoherent ice-contact sediment (or till) interfingered distally with glaciomarine sediment that began to be deposited c. 14.2 ka BP. The moraines formed by stabilization of ice that calved rapidly back along troughs on the continental shelf. The ice front retreated to fjord-heads and stabilized to form ice contact delta terraces declining in elevation westward from +26 m to just below present sea level. Stratified glaciomarine sediments accumulated in fjords, while currents outside fjords eroded the upper part of the glaciomarine deposits, forming an unconformity bracketed by dates of 12.8 and 8.5 ka BP. The delta terraces are broadly correlated with the 12.7 ka BP Robinson's Head readvance west of the area. The ice front retreated inland, pausing three or four times to form lines of small bouldery stillstand moraines, heads of outwash, sidehill melt:water channels, and beaded eskers. Lake-sediment cores across this belt yield dated pollen evidence of three climatic reversals to which the moraines are equated: the Killarney Oscillation c. 11.2 ka BP, the Younger Dryas chronozone 11.0-10.4 ka BP, and an unnamed cold event c. 9.7 ka BP. Relative sea level fell in the early Holocene because of crustal rebound, so that outwash and other alluvium accumulated in deltas now submerged due to relative sea-level rise.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				DEC	2000	29	4					295	314																WOS:000165570700004
J	Cobelas, MA; Rojo, C; Carrillo, SS				Alvarez Cobelas, Miguel; Rojo, Carmen; Sanchez Carrillo, Salvador			Nutrient export from largely pristine catchments (Serrania de Cuenca, Central Spain)	BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO												We report here the summer nutrient (organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) export from pristine catchments of the Serrania de Cuenca (Central Spain). These mountains are mostly encompassed by forested and rangeland landscapes and appear to have important groundwater outputs. On the basis of instantaneous sampling for nutrient chemistry, including in situ records of discharge in these largely non-gauged areas, nutrient fluxes downstream were estimated. Long-term (1982-2010) annual yields of total nitrogen and phosphorus downstream were also estimated from official data using discharge and concentrations at three larger sub-catchments, with the aim of relating them to the effects of global warming. Average nutrient concentrations in these streams were rather low.The fraction of organic nitrogen content was relatively high, as in other forested catchments. Variability of concentrations changed from one catchment to another, but was wide. Organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus export downstream ranged from one- for organic carbon and nitrogen to three orders of magnitude for phosphorus, but these values lie within the lower quartile of reported export worldwide.There were no statistically significant relationships between discharge and nutrient concentrations. Water retention by lakes and reservoirs upstream decreased the variability of nutrients, particulate organic carbon and total nitrogen, but total phosphorus retention was unaffected. The catchment surface area and land use were unrelated with the phosphorus export. In-stream biological processes appeared to be negligible for nutrient export. Contrary to the N export the annual P flux exportwas partly explained by discharge (and hence rainfall) in the long-term, which seemingly suggests a global warming effect for P. Our results suggest that pristine catchments experience a complex behaviour of nutrient export that deserves further research, and should be more detailed to see if groundwater input plays a significant role.																			0366-0176	2253-6167				OCT-DEC	2020	131	4					559	580		10.21701/bolgeomin.131.4.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.21701/bolgeomin.131.4.003													WOS:000697276500003
J	KAISER, MS; SPECKMAN, PL; JONES, JR				KAISER, MS; SPECKMAN, PL; JONES, JR			STATISTICAL-MODELS FOR LIMITING NUTRIENT RELATIONS IN INLAND WATERS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION												The ecological theory of limiting factors holds that the observed level of response in a biological process will be governed by the input factor in least supply-the limiting factor. This theory has formed the basis for numerous attempts by aquatic ecologists to describe the relation between the biological productivity of inland waters and the availability of plant nutrients required for algal growth. Regression analysis has been the primary statistical tool used in the development of such relations, yet any statistical model that represents the limiting effect of some explanatory factor as an expectation contradicts the substantive theory of limiting factors. Limnological data not resulting in an adequate regression of chlorophyll on phosphorus have been viewed as failing to support the limiting effect of this nutrient on algal biomass in lakes. But when represented by a more appropriate model, such data may be seen to provide similar evidence for the relation of chlorophyll to phosphorus as does data resulting in a strong regression. Data from limnological studies often exhibit a scatter of points distributed in the shape of a triangle lying beneath an upper boundary. Appropriate models for such data are introduced to describe the upper boundary or potential limit, the distribution of points falling below the limit, and the degree of random error. An application of the EM algorithm provides marginal maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in the more complex models considered. Several results are given for the models, including a goodness-of-fit diagnostic and estimation of the Large-sample parameter covariance matrix. Application of the models is illustrated by fitting empirical relationships between chlorophyll and the plant nutrient phosphorus in temperate lakes.																			0162-1459					JUN	1994	89	426					410	423		10.2307/2290841	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2290841													WOS:A1994NN15500011

Evidence for periodic, Holocene loess deposition in kettles in a sandy, interlobate landscape, Michigan, USA	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Loess deposits are common in mid-continental North America, but are rare in Michigan, and most loess found in this region is of last-glacial age. We report on evidence for Holocene-age, silt-dominated deposits found in kettle bottoms, which we interpret as loess. These silty deposits contrast with the broader interlobate landscape, which is composed of glaciofluvial materials dominated by medium and fine sands (125-500 mu m). The abrupt lateral edges of the silty deposits, and their unique textural properties relative to the surrounding landscape, suggest that the silts were not washed from kettle backslopes. Rather, we suggest that the silts originated as loess that was episodically deposited in kettle bottoms across the Upland. Later, loess that may have been deposited on backslopes was occasionally redeposited into the centers of vegetated kettles, along with some background sands, by wind and water. Evidence in support of our conclusions includes (1) the fine-silty textural characteristics of the sediments, set within an otherwise sand-dominated landscape, (2) depositional sequences of charcoal-rich paleosols, intercalated within the otherwise "clean" kettle bottom silts, pointing to episodes of loess deposition interspersed with periods of slope stability and pedogenesis, and (3) increased silt contents within the upper meter of sandy soils on nearby stable uplands. Radiocarbon ages on bulk charcoal from nine paleosols within the kettle-bottom silt deposits fall mainly within the early Holocene. These deposits and C-14 ages provide the first evidence of Holocene loess in the Great lakes region, some of which probably originated from the nearby Muskegon River floodplain.

Why is the relative abundance of Asterionella formosa increasing in a Boreal Shield lake as nutrient levels decline?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The freshwater diatom Asterionella formosa Hassall is a widely distributed species whose populations have been increasing in the recent sediments of numerous lakes worldwide. This taxon's proliferation has commonly been associated with nutrient enrichment and, more recently, with twentieth century increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition. However, a growing number of studies have reported increases in A. formosa in the absence of increased nutrients and have thus raised questions about whether alternative causative factors (such as recent climate warming) may be important. Here we assess the relative importance of nutrients and climate warming on A. formosa by comparing regional air temperature trends and 20 years of annually measured lake water nutrients (total inorganic nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) with past changes in relative abundance of this taxon from a sediment core obtained from a soft-water, Boreal Shield lake (George Lake, Killarney, Ontario). Measured lake water total phosphorus has always been very low and remains so to the present (< 10 A mu g L-1). Total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, however, show distinct declining trends (p < 0.05) at George Lake since the 1990s, when substantial increases in mean annual and mean winter air temperatures (p < 0.01) were also recorded. These declines in lake water nitrogen concentrations match declines in atmospherically deposited nitrogen in this region. Since the late-1980s and early-1990s, there has been a marked increase in the relative abundance of A. formosa, which had been virtually absent from the lake's sediment record in earlier intervals. A. formosa trends closely track increasing regional air temperatures, but also clearly coincide with declines in lake water nutrients and decreases in regional nitrogen deposition (p < 0.01). These trends have also occurred in other lakes in the region. Our results show that increases in nitrogen deposition and/or nutrient enrichment are not pre-conditions for increases in the relative abundance of A. formosa. Instead, warming-related changes including longer open water periods, changes in lake mixing regimes, and lake thermal properties might have contributed to the recent increase in the relative abundance of A. formosa in this lake and likely elsewhere.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Sivarajah, Branaavan/0000-0002-3739-4299													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2016	55	4					357	367		10.1007/s10933-016-9886-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9886-2													WOS:000373304300004

However, most temperate-zone ectotherms actually spend more time sequestered in retreats (e.g., under rocks) than active above ground. We documented retreat-site selection during summer by gravid garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) at Eagle Lake in northeastern California, USA. To explore the thermal consequences of retreat-site selection, we measured potential body temperatures in retreats and combined these with data on thermal tolerances, thermal preferences, and thermal dependence of metabolism and digestion. Garter snakes at Eagle Lake usually retreated under rocks of intermediate thickness (20-30 cm) even though both thinner and thicker rocks were available. Empirical and biophysical analyses of temperatures under rocks of various sizes and shapes demonstrated that rock thickness had the dominant effect on potential Tb available to snakes and in turn on thermal physiology. Snakes selecting thin rocks (< 20 cm thick) or very shallow burrows would die of heat stress in midafternoon and would have strongly impaired physiological capacity from cold at night. Snakes selecting very thick rocks (> 40 cm thick) or remaining at the bottom of deep burrows would not experience such extreme Tb, but neither would they warm to Tb in their preferred range. However, snakes selecting intermediate-thickness rocks would never overheat but would achieve preferred Tb for long periods.sbd.far longer than if they remained on the ground surface or moved up and down within a burrow. Interestingly snakes selecting burrows or intermediate-thickness rocks may be able to have either the highest energy gain or the lowest overall metabolic rate, depending on the particular Tb they select. Medium-thickness rocks, the size rocks normally selected by the snakes, offer them a variety of suitable thermoregulatory opportunities.					; Porter, Warren/IXW-6999-2023; Huey, Raymond/F-1597-2010	Huey, Raymond/0000-0002-4962-8670; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				AUG	1989	70	4					931	944		10.2307/1941360	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941360													WOS:A1989AH20300013

Cores collected in the summer of 2010 were studied through the application of magnetizations and progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization of u-channel samples, with additional data provided by computed tomography (CT) derived density, hysteresis measurements, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition experiments, organic carbon content, biogenic silica, physical grain size, radiocarbon dating of wood, seeds, and plant macrofossils, point source magnetic susceptibility, and Xray fluorescence (XRF). With similar magnetic properties to regional Alaskan loess deposits, low coercivity, highly magnetic material deposited during the late-Pleistocene contrasts with a high coercivity, weakly magnetic component found throughout the record, consistent with locally-derived detritus. The relative proportion of low coercivity to high coercivity magnetic material, defined by the S-Ratios, is used to reconstruct the regional input of dust to the basin over time. A four-fold decrease in the low coercivity component through the deglacial transition is interpreted to reflect diminished dust input to the region. Comparisons with potential sources of dust show that the timing of deposition in Burial Lake is largely consistent with general aridity, lack of vegetative cover, and increased windiness, rather than glacial advances or retreats. The influence from subaerial exposure of continental shelves cannot be ruled out as a significant far-field source of dust to interior Alaska during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but is unlikely to have been the sole source, or to have contributed to increased dust in both the early and late Holocene.

This paper took Wuhan (one of the four hottest furnace cities in China) as an example to explore several strategies for mitigating the surface urban heat island (UHI), measured by the land surface temperature, including green roofs, cool roofs, bright pavements, and altered urban building patterns. The offline urbanized High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (u-HRLDAS) was used to conduct 1-km resolution numerical simulations, which also accounts for the effects of Wuhan's abundant lakes on UHI evolution, with a dynamic lake model. The diurnal cycle and spatial distribution of simulated UHI were analyzed under different mitigation strategies. Results show that considering lake effects reduces daytime (nighttime) UHI intensity by about 1.0 K (0.5 K). Green roofs and cool roofs are more effective in mitigating daytime UHI than bright pavements. The maximum UHI reduction is about 2.1 K at 13:00 local time by replacing 80 % of conventional roofs with green roofs. The UHI mitigation efficiency increases with larger fractions of green roofs, and increased albedo of roofs and roads. In contrast to green roofs, cool roofs and bright pavements are ineffective during nighttime, changing the urban building pattern to mitigate UHL is effective throughout the day. "Height-driven building structure changing" (raising the building height while changing the fraction of impervious surface in each grid to keep the total building volume intact) can reduce surface UHF intensity by 0.4-0.9 K, and "density-driven building structure changing" (distributing building density uniformly and modifying the building height to make the total building volume unchanged) reduces UHI by 1.2-2.6 K. These results showed new insights in mitigating UHIs for mega cities, like Wuhan, and provides a practical guideline for policymakers to offer more habitable cities.

Unfortunately, a rapid loss of alpine lakes in China has occurred in recent decades; however, intensive human activities, together with regional differences in the responses of lakes to climate change, has impeded our understanding of the contribution of climate change to the loss of these lakes. To better understand how alpine lakes will evolve with continuing global warming, we used the analysis of new sedimentary proxies from Lake Gonghai, an undisturbed alpine lake, together with a review of published records, to reconstruct variations in integrated lake status since the last deglaciation. From 14,660-11,890 cal. yr BP the lake was in the most unstable state, indicated by the highest amplitude fluctuations in lake level and the within lake environment. The lake status experienced clear millennial-scale changes. During the early and middle Holocene (11,890-3200 cal. yr BP), the most stable lake status occurred, consistent with the highest precipitation levels. Owing to the highest level of freshwater influx in the middle Holocene (8-5 ka), the lake water was the deepest and most acidic. At this time, the dense vegetation cover resulted in maximum catchment stability and the lowest level of soil erosion, and hence the lowest sediment accumulation rate. From 3200 cal. yr BP, decreasing mean annual precipitation resulted in a moderately stable lake status, a shallow water depth and more alkaline lake water. The sparse vegetation cover caused a dramatic increase in the erosion rate and hence in the sediment accumulation rate. We infer that variations in local humidity were the major control on the integrated lake status during the last similar to 14,600 cal. yr BP. With the anticipated progression of global warming, the status of the alpine lakes in the region may continue to deteriorate and appropriate mitigation strategies are imperative.

Baseline length changes measured using a two-color geodimeter with submillimeter precision revealed that the resurgent dome started to reinflate in late 1989. Measurements between late 1989 and mid-1992 revealed nearly 13 cm of extension across the resurgent dome. Geodetic leveling surveys with approximately 2-mm precision made in late 1988 and in mid-1992 revealed a maximum of about 8 cm of uplift of the resurgent dome. Two ellipsoidal sources satisfy both the leveling and two-color measurements, whereas spherical point sources could not. The model's primary inflation source is located 5.5 km beneath the resurgent dome with the two horizontal axes being nearly equal in size and the vertical axis being 4 times the length of the horizontal axes. A second ellipsoidal source was added to improve the fit to the two-color measurements. This secondary source is located at a depth between 10 and 20 km beneath the south moat of the caldera and has the geometry of an elongated ellipsoid or pipe that dips down to the northeast. In addition, the leveling data suggest dike intrusion beneath Mammoth Mountain during the 1988-1992 interval, which is likely associated with an intense swarm of small earthquakes during the summer of 1989 at that location. Our analysis shows the dike intrusion to be the shallowest of the three sources with a depth range of 1-3 km below the surface to the top of the intrusion.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				JUL 10	1995	100	B7					12487	12495		10.1029/95JB01052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JB01052													WOS:A1995RH81200013
J	Collins, J; Dronova, I				Collins, Jed; Dronova, Iryna			Urban Landscape Change Analysis Using Local Climate Zones and Object-Based Classification in the Salt Lake Metro Region, Utah, USA	REMOTE SENSING												Urban areas globally are vulnerable to warming climate trends exacerbated by their growing populations and heat island effects. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) typology has become a popular framework for characterizing urban microclimates in different regions using various classification methods, including a widely adopted pixel-based protocol by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) Project. However, few studies to date have explored the potential of object-based image analysis (OBIA) to facilitate classification of LCZs given their inherent complexity, and few studies have further used the LCZ framework to analyze land cover changes in urban areas over time. This study classified LCZs in the Salt Lake Metro Region, Utah, USA for 1993 and 2017 using a supervised object-based analysis of Landsat satellite imagery and assessed their change during this time frame. The overall accuracy, measured for the most recent classification period (2017), was equal to 64% across 12 LCZs, with most of the error resulting from similarities among highly developed LCZs and non-developed classes with sparse or low-stature vegetation. The observed 1993-2017 changes in LCZs indicated a regional tendency towards primarily suburban, open low-rise development, and large low-rise and paved classes. However, despite the potential for local cooling with landscape transitions likely to increase vegetation cover and irrigation compared to pre-development conditions, summer averages of Landsat-derived top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures showed a pronounced warming between 1992-1994 and 2016-2018 across the study region, with a 0.1-2.9 degrees C increase among individual LCZs. Our results indicate that future applications of LCZs towards urban change analyses should develop a stronger understanding of LCZ microclimate sensitivity to changes in size and configuration of urban neighborhoods and regions. Furthermore, while OBIA is promising for capturing the heterogeneous and multi-scale nature of LCZs, its applications could be strengthened by adopting more generalizable approaches for LCZ-relevant segmentation and validation, and by incorporating active remote sensing data to account for the 3D complexity of urban areas.																				2072-4292				JUL 1	2019	11	13							1615	10.3390/rs11131615	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11131615													WOS:000477049000106
