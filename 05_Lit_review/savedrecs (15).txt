Nevertheless, the community dynamics of bacteria and eukaryotes in rivers and their responses to changes in ecological hydrology have not been studied thoroughly. Based on eDNA technology, this study investigated the bacterial and eukaryotic communities in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Weihe River in different seasons. The seasonal variation and geographical distribution of bacterial and eukaryotic community structures showed significant heterogeneity. The selective theory well explained the response of microbial community assembly to seasonal changes. Deterministic processes dominate microbial community assembly in the middle and lower reaches. The composition and metabolic potential of key functional genes of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling (nosZ, pqqB, pqqD, and pqqE) exhibited strong seasonal patterns and were significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of water. There were significant differences in molecular ecological networks in different periods (p < 0.05), with a gradually increasing trend in the complexity of the network from winter to summer. The keystone species (Hub) of the microbial food web in each season included microorganisms (Malikia), algae (Stephanodiscus), and invertebrates (Polyarthra). Structural equation modeling (SEM) results indicated that invertebrate was an important driving factor affecting the changes in community structures. In micro-food webs, both "bottom-up" (resources) and "top-down" (predation) forces strictly controlled the relationship between taxa. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations affected microbial networks, and there was a significant correlation between bacterial and eukaryotic groups and eco-hydrological variables (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we identified the taxon's change point using threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), quantitatively revealing the response thresholds of taxa to eco-hydrological changes.

Sedimentation in this unusual type of endorheic lake with a very restricted catchment area is highly sensitive to environmental and hydrological changes. The Isona tufa mound complex, north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, is associated with the discharge zone of a confined artesian aquifer and comprises 11 tufa mounds consisting of an annular rimstone enclosing a central depression filled with lake deposits. Data gathered from trenches excavated in four palaeolakes located within three different morphostratigraphic units permitted a precise analysis of the geometrical characteristics and stratigraphic relationships of the deposits and provided a sedimentation model for the Late Quaternary infilling of the spring-fed lakes. The work illustrates that trenches allow a precise characterization of the stratigraphic arrangements, lateral facies changes and deformation structures, which are not apparent in studies relying solely on borehole records, and facilitate sampling for dating and geochemical analyses. The five sedimentary facies described represent different evolutionary stages of the lakes, including: (i) carbonate-rich palustrine deposits probably related to periods with strong hydrological seasonality; (ii) massive highly bioturbated organic ooze; (iii) banded organic carbonate-rich facies associated with an increase in the regional effective moisture; (iv) fine-grained quartz-rich aeolian/slope-wash sediments; and (v) colluvial facies deposited following the desiccation of the lakes located at higher altitudes. Geochemical and sedimentological analyses of the lacustrine sequences provided information on the palaeohydrological evolution of the Isona tufa mound complex and the palaeoenvironmental conditions of the area over the last 28ka. Radiometric dating suggests that deposition occurred simultaneously at ca 22ka in palaeolakes situated at different elevations. A drop in the piezometric level prompted by the opening of springs at lower altitudes probably caused the deactivation of the upper springs and the desiccation of the lakes. Arid conditions prevailed in the area during the Late Glacial and the early Holocene (280 to 85ka bp). More humid conditions recorded from 85 to 42ka and again since 17ka are in accordance with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions available in the Western Mediterranean since the Last Glacial Maximum.					; Corella, Juan Pablo/J-2486-2013; Guerrero, Jesús/K-2935-2019; Pellicer, Xavier/J-8533-2017; Zarroca, Mario/AAB-5947-2021; Corella, Juan Pablo/CAI-6873-2022	Gutierrez Santolalla, Francisco/0000-0002-5407-940X; Corella, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-5127-9011; Roque Pau, Carles/0000-0003-0650-160X; comas, xavier/0000-0001-8141-6195; Guerrero Iturbe, Jesus/0000-0003-2181-732X; Zarroca, Mario/0000-0001-6907-1892; Pellicer, Xavier/0000-0002-1508-728X; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2016	63	6					1786	1819		10.1111/sed.12290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12290													WOS:000383578000021
J	Ren, X; Sha, YY; Shi, ZG; Liu, XD				Ren, Xin; Sha, Yingying; Shi, Zhengguo; Liu, Xiaodong			Response of summer extreme precipitation over East Asia during the mid-Holocene versus future global warming	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Changes in extreme precipitation have significant impacts on society and the environment. In recent years, the response of extreme precipitation over East Asia to global warming has received considerable attention; however, few studies have focused on the extreme precipitation in geological warm periods, especially the mid-Holocene-the most recent warm period on the orbital timescale. In this study, the outputs of mid-Holocene, preindustrial and CO2-induced warming experiments using a coupled climate model (MPI-ESM-P) were employed to examine the changes in extreme precipitation over East Asia in the mid-Holocene and under future warming scenario, respectively. The results show that, during the mid-Holocene, summer extreme precipitation increases over the east of China but decreases over Japan and the surrounding oceans. However, under CO2-induced warming, summer extreme precipitation increases over the southeast of China, Japan, and the surrounding oceans, but decreases over the north of East Asia. Moisture budget analysis shows that these distinct responses come from different changes in moisture and circulation during the two periods. During the mid-Holocene, higher insolation over the Northern Hemisphere leads to a larger ocean-land thermal contrast and a stronger East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The strengthened EASM brings more moisture to continental East Asia, resulting in an increase in both mean and extreme precipitation. In contrast, the CO2-induced warming facilitates an anomalous heating center in the upper troposphere over the tropical part of Northwestern Pacific ocean, which weakens the EASM. However, enhanced atmospheric moisture counterbalances the effect of the weakened EASM, resulting in more extreme precipitation over the south of East Asia.

This hypothesis is supported by a series of experiments in which intact cores of sediment were incubated under different environmental conditions, after which the water overlying the sediments was harvested as a culture medium for growing a toxic strain of the common cyanobacterium Microcystis. Both littoral and profundal sediments from Lake Kinneret, the largest freshwater lake in Israel, released substantial amounts of dissolved phosphorus (1.0 and 4.0 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively) and nitrogen (44.2 and 24.3 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively) under simulated summer conditions in the laboratory. In comparison, nutrient fluxes from sediments under simulated winter conditions were considerably smaller or negative. The addition of nutrient-rich overlying water harvested from profundal sediments, and to a lesser extent from littoral sediments, increased both chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations in Microcystis cultures. In contrast, when Microcystis cells were inoculated in natural surface waters only, the cultures did not grow or produce microcystins, and soon collapsed. This study provides experimental evidence of a link between internal nutrient loading from sediments and microcystin concentrations in freshwaters, and demonstrates how environmental factors may indirectly exert control over toxin concentrations in freshwater lakes.

Charophytes were most frequent and developed highest biomass at water depths below 3 m. Counts of wintering Pochard showed that water-based recreational activity displaced birds from lakes. Analysis of bird density showed significantly higher use of reserves with restricted bankside access than lakes where angling, walking or other bank-side activities were permitted. These in tum supported higher Pochard densities than lakes with water-based recreation.

J	RAHRER, JF				RAHRER, JF			GROWTH OF LAKE TROUT IN LAKE SUPERIOR BEFORE MAXIMUM ABUNDANCE OF SEA LAMPREYS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The growth in length of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from the inshore water of Lake Superior in 1953 increased with age from the 3rd to 9th year, and was nearly constant from the 9th to the 12th year. Growth was greatest in the 1st year (4.0 inches) and least in the 2nd and 3rd years (2.3 inches). Between the 4th and 9th years the increments increased from 2.6 to 3.5 in. Growth was calculated from a curvilinear body-scale relation. Intraseasonal growth in length extended from late April until well after Oct; most growth was in late summer and fall. The younger fish started growth earlier, and some mature fish did not increase in length until after Oct. spawning. Lake trout reached the minimum legal weight (1.5 pounds) in the 7th year of life and the average size taken in the commercial fishery (about 3 pounds) in the 8th year. The annual increase in weight in the 8th year of life was over 64%. Fish used in this study grew more slowly than those from Lakes Michigan and Huron taken during the period when sea lamprey abundance was increasing, but at about the same rate as lake trout of Lake Michigan before the sea lamprey appeared.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1967	96	3					268	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[268:GOLTIL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[268:GOLTIL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19679674800005

Growth and removal rates for bacteria in the inner and outer regions of the Changjiang River plume were characterized by a series of dilution experiments at four sites, two inner sites (I-1 and I-2) and two outer sites (O-1 and O-2) in the summers of 2011 and 2012. Bacterial growth rates varied between 0.058 and 0.157 h(1), with higher growth rates detected in the inner plume. Grazing mortality rates ranged from 0.042 to 0.126 h1, with highest grazing rates detected in the inner plume. Viral lysis of bacteria was not significant at three of eight stations, and accounted for 50 of bacterial mortality only once. These findings suggest that grazing nanoflagellates may play a key role in controlling bacterial biomass, and the impact of the nanoflagellates exceeds that of viral lysis during the summer period, especially in the inner region of the Changjiang River plume. It is speculated that the weakening correlation between viruses and bacteria in the inner plume, as well as the increasing virus to bacteria ratio from offshore oligotrophic waters to estuarine waters, may be a consequence of the increasing relative abundance of non-bacteriophage viruses with increasing environmental productivity.

J	SCAVIA, D; LANG, GA; KITCHELL, JF				SCAVIA, D; LANG, GA; KITCHELL, JF			DYNAMICS OF LAKE-MICHIGAN PLANKTON - A MODEL EVALUATION OF NUTRIENT LOADING, COMPETITION, AND PREDATION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Michigan''s offshore ecosystem has been altered dramatically during the past decade. Summer zooplankton dominance has changed from calanoid copepods to Daphnia and the substantial contribution of filamentous blue-green algae to summer phytoplankton has been replaced by phytoflagellates. These changes occurred concurrently with reduced P load, P concentration, and abundance of the dominant zooplanktivore, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). In this analysis we pose alternative hypotheses of nutrient loading and species interactions as determinants of zooplankton and phytoplankton species composition in the summer epilimnion. We evaluate these hypothesis with a food web model that was calibrated to measurements of the 1980s Lake Michigan plankton composition and algal production, sedimentation, and growth rates and literature estimates of zooplankton secondary production and nutrient excretion. The model simulates the influence of gradients of both P load and alewife abundance on predation-competition interactions. We conclude that summer plankton composition in Lake Michigan is controlled largely by predation. The model further predicts a return to a plankton community similar to that of the 1970s under a scenario of increasing invertebrate predation by a new zooplankton species for Lake Michigan, Bythotrephes cederstroemi.

A stable isotope study of the Garda lake, Northern Italy: Its hydrological balance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Discontinuous measurements of the isotopic composition of surface water samples of the Garda take carried out between 1998 and 2006 showed almost constant delta O-18, delta D and d-excess values through time. During 2006 and 2007 monthly vertical profiles of water samples were collected in the northernmost section of the take, not far from the main inflow (Sarca river) to check whether there was any detectable influence from this inflowing river and whether there was a vertical isotopic stratification of the take water. The isotopic measurement of water samples from the vertical profiles yielded isotopic values which were almost equal to those obtained from surface waters showing no detectable effect of the inflowing river water and no isotopic vertical stratification. The attempt to evaluate the evaporation rate of take water by means of current models was totally unsuccessful. Despite the marked summer warming of the surface layer no isotopic fractionation related to evaporation processes could be detected. This anomalous behaviour may be related to the large amount of spring and summer precipitation characteristic of this area. The water balance of the take calculated according to the amount of the inflowing water (Sarca river water plus rain water on the take plus 20% of the precipitations on the whole catchment basin) and to the amount of outflowing water (Mincio river) showed a large imbalance, the river outflow alone resulting on average, during the last decade, at least double the inflow. To explain this imbalance of the take, a large recharge by concealed groundwater is suggested: its isotopic composition should be quite close to the mean isotopic composition of precipitations over that area. This would be in agreement with the almost constant isotopic composition of both surface and deep waters and with the lack of vertical isotopic stratification. A few measurements of the tritium concentration carried out on take water show values that are considerably higher than modern tritium values either in precipitation or in the Sarca river water: these results are in good agreement with the hypothesis of a recharge of the take by deep aquifers.

J	McDonough, KM; Dzombak, DA				McDonough, KM; Dzombak, DA			Microcosm experiments to assess the effects of temperature and microbial activity on polychlorinated biphenyl transport in anaerobic sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Increased polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) loadings from sediment to the water column under low-flow conditions during late spring and summer months have been observed in the Grasse River (Massena, NY) and other PCB-contaminated rivers in the United States. Temperature appears to be an important factor affecting this phenomenon, as increased sediment temperature leads to increased microbial and bioturbator activity as well as increased rates of diffusion and desorption. Laboratory-scale sediment microcosms were developed and used to study with fine-scale resolution the effects of temperature and microbial activity on PCB transport in river sediment. Over the time course of these experiments, with the extraction procedures used, irreversible sorption of each congener to sediment was observed and increased with aging of the sediment. Temperature-dependent transport was observed for PCB congeners 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (BZ29), 2,5-dichlorobiphenyl (BZ9), and 2-chlorobiphenyl (BZ1) in Grasse River sediment and a synthetic sediment system. The fastest transport of the congeners occurred in biologically active Grasse River sediment followed by biologically inactive (autoclaved) Grasse River sediment, and synthetic sediment. The increased transport in biologically active sediment demonstrated the importance of microbial activity, in particular gas bubble generation, in PCB transport in near-surface sediments.					; Dzombak, David/ABV-4282-2022	McDonough, Kathleen/0000-0001-8615-1341; Dzombak, David/0000-0002-9906-9889													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 15	2005	39	24					9517	9522		10.1021/es051249p	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es051249p								16475330					WOS:000234133300023

Hydrology and pore water chemistry in a permafrost wetland, Ilulissat, Greenland	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrological and geochemical processes controlling the pore water chemistry in a permafrost wetland, with loam overlain by sphagnum peat, were investigated. The vertical distributions of dissolved Cl, and of pore water delta O-18, appeared unrelated to ion freeze-out and isotope ice-water fractionation processes, respectively, dismissing solute freeze-out as a main control on the water chemistry. However, concentrations of major ions, others than Cl, generally increased with depth into the active layer. A conceptual model for water and solute movement in the active layer was derived. The model indicates upward diffusive transport of elements, released in the loam layer by mineral weathering, to the peat layer, in which lateral advective transport dominates. Active layer pore water and water of melted core sections of permafrost were of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type (1: 1: 4 stoichiometry) and were subsaturated for calcite and dolomite. The results are consistent with an annual cycling of inorganic carbon species, Ca and Mg, via cryogenic carbonate precipitation during fall freeze-up and their redissolution following spring thaw. Similarly, elevated Fe2+ concentrations appear to be related to cryogenic siderite formation. Pore water in the active layer showed high partial pressures of CO2, indicating the feasibility of bubble ebullition as a greenhouse gas emission pathway from permafrost wetlands. Elevated concentrations of geogenic trace elements (Ni, Al, and As) were observed, and the controlling geochemical processes are discussed. The conceptual model for water and solute movement was applied to quantify the contribution of released trace elements to a downstream lake in the permafrost catchment.

Pedestrian traffic is the main driver of macro- and large microplastic debris deposition in urban stormwater drains	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Land-based sources are the greatest contributors of plastic pollution found in aquatic environments. Although plastic debris items spilling into natural watercourses from stormwater outflow sites have been investigated, this study provides details of the plastic items that can be trapped within stormwater drains prior to release. We examined macroplastic (>5 mm) and large microplastic (1-5 mm) debris that accumulated in LittaTrapTM devices at six drains over four seasonal periods in London, Ontario, Canada. Flotation, visual identification, microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to determine the drivers of plastic debris deposition. Macroplastics (MaPs) and microplastics (MPs) were identified in all 36 samples, and the totals ranged from 5-158 MaPs and 18-359 MPs per trap. Out of the 118 different MaPs found, the most common items were cigarette butts, wrappers, and expanded polystyrene. The main MPs were fragments, foams, and fibres. The most common macroplastic applications were "smoking", "food/beverage packaging", "household", and non-food or beverage "packaging". Microplastic particle compositions were mainly polyethylene and polypropylene, but other polymer types fall within the applications of construction (paints and resins), automotive/transportation, and electronics. The summer samples contained the greatest averages of plastic debris, and the drains located in busy pedestrian areas were associated with the highest debris counts. The results support pedestrian traffic as the main driver of plastic debris accumulation in urban London stormwater drains, which is controlled by seasonal weather conditions.																				2296-665X				NOV 15	2024	12								1459259	10.3389/fenvs.2024.1459259	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1459259													WOS:001372474200001
J	Ports, MA				Ports, Mark A.			Terrestrial mollusks of Great Basin National Park, the Snake Range, Nevada, USA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												In this paper I report on the poorly known terrestrial mollusk fauna of Great Basin National Park (Snake Range) of the central Great Basin, USA. Mollusk species and numbers were recorded according to habitat affinities defined by a combination of rock type, geomorphology, plant communities, and water sources. A total of 6892 individuals representing 18 species of land snails and 1 species of slug were identified from 50 stations within GBNP during the period of spring 2014 through summer 2016. Mollusks were surveyed by 186 soil/litter samples and 1755 min of hand searching. Twelve habitat types included 2 xeric limestone/dolomite environments with conifer/aspen woodlands and no perennial waters (10 species in woodland litter and 15 species in rock slides below cliff faces). Two habitats dominated by granite/quartz rock with conifer/aspen woodlands and perennial streams supported 12 species in woodland litter and 13 species in rock slides. Eight species were recorded from a lower-elevation riparian habitat with cottonwood and shrubs. Two high-elevation habitats (approximately 3000 m) without perennial waters and dominated by bristlecone pine supported 1 species in limestone and 3 species in granite/quartz. A single high-elevation habitat (2800 m) of xeric pinyon pine/mountain mahogany and granitic/quartz rock supported 4 species. Two lower-elevation habitats (1800 m) supported 2 species in a sagebrush steppe, while no mollusks were found in pinyon pine/Utah juniper woodland. Two localized mesic habitats were associated with boggy streamsides and natural springs and supported 11 species each. The single species of slug Deroceras laeve and a species of succineid snail are restricted to these 2 habitat types. The 4 most common species of land snails (Pupilla hebes, Vallonia cyclophorella, Euconulus fulvus, and Vitrina pellucida) were present in 7 to 9 of the habitat types and represented 70% of the individual shells recovered.

Chloride concentration is a function of the amount of deicing salt applied during the winter season and the amount of water in which the salt can be diluted. An estimation of seasonal amount of deicing salt in relation to amount of run-off was used in order to identify the effects of deicing salt. The measured chloride concentration in a lake used as a municipal water supply was similar to the concentration estimated by a simple steady state method accounting for the catchment area. The simplified steady state method was a useful tool for estimating steady state concentrations on a regional level, including a non-influenced lake as a comparison.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2003	48	9					51	59		10.2166/wst.2003.0491	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2003.0491								14703139					WOS:000187915400006

The 14C-technique used in the grazing and assimilation study is discussed in detail, with a critical analysis of the methodological errors. The 3 major species which contributed to the annual density, biomass and grazing maxima in spring are Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia spp. and Eudiaptomus gracilis. The rise in grazing pressure in recent years, particularly in May, was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the seston (< 33 .mu.m) biomass and in an increase of inedible algae, especially Ceratium hirundinella, in late summer. The means of daily grazing ranged from 3% in March to 34% in June. The mean annual ratio ingestion: phytoplankton production varied from 70 to 230%. The specific filtering rate (SFR) was related directly to water temperature, but inversely to the food concentrations. The main errors in the ingestion and assimilation rates were related to isotope leaching from the animals in the preservation fluid. The loss of tracer was 42 and 26%, respectively, for the 2 rates. In spring, the food removed by the grazers per day was equivalent to 125-400% of the daily primary production. This caused a sharp decrease in the seston concentrations and a recurring clear water phase because of a sharp increase in the Secchi depth. The zooplankton assimilatory removal of C and the sedimentation loss rates to the hypolimnion exceeded the primary production rates. The inconsistencies in the C budget are possibly due to the lack of knowledge of the horizontal transport of material from the littoral, bacteria as an alternative food source for zooplankton and the DOC [dissolved organic C] dynamics. The grazers'' activity as SFR in deep, stratifying lakes like Vechten is 3-4 times that in the shallow, mixed and more eutrophic Dutch lakes. In the former category of lakes, the crustacean herbivores serve as an important link in the food chain in the limnetic region.

J	CHRZANOWSKI, TH; HUBBARD, JG				CHRZANOWSKI, TH; HUBBARD, JG			PRIMARY AND BACTERIAL SECONDARY PRODUCTION IN A SOUTHWESTERN RESERVOIR	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Rates of primary and bacterial secondary production in Lake Arlington, Texas, were determined. The lake is a warm (annual temperature range, 7 to 32.degree. C), shallow, monomictic reservoir with limited macrophyte development in the littoral zone. Samples were collected from six depths within the photic zone from a site located over the deepest portion of the lake. Primary production and bacterial production were calculated from NaH14CO3 and [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation, respectively. Peak instantaneous production ranged between 14.8 and 220.5 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1. There were two distinct periods of high rates of production. From May through July, production near the metalimnion exceeded 100 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1. During homomixis, production throughout the water column was in excess of 100 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1 and above 150 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1 near the surface. Annual areal primary production was 588 g of C m-2. Bacterial production was markedly seasonal. Growth rates during late fall through spring were typically around 0.002 h-1, and production rates were typically 5 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1. Growth rates were higher during warmer parts of the year and reached 0.03 h-1 by August. The maximum instantaneous rate of bacterial production was approximately 45 .mu.g of C liter-1 h-1. Annual areal bacterial production was 125 g of C m-2. Temporal and spatial distributions of bacterial numbers and activities coincided with temporal and spatial distributions of primary production. Areal primary and bacterial secondary production were highly correlated (r = 0.77, n = 15, P < 0.002).																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	1988	54	3					661	669		10.1128/AEM.54.3.661-669.1988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.54.3.661-669.1988								16347577					WOS:A1988M313600008

Seasonal and Year-to-Year Variations of Phytoplankton Primary Production in the Rybinsk Reservoir: The Effect of Weather and Climate Variations	WATER RESOURCES												The seasonal and long-term dynamics of phytoplankton primary production has been studied in the Rybinsk Reservoir (Upper Volga) in 2005-2014. A positive correlation has been found to exist between the values of plankton primary production, averaged over vegetation period, and the abiotic factors of the water medium (temperature, solar radiation, and nutrient concentrations), as well as, excluding the data on the anomalously hot summer of 2010, between the primary production and the index of North Atlantic Oscillation. The increase in water temperature (up to 27.9 degrees C) in the summer of 2010 has caused a considerable increase in phytoplankton production. A considerable increase in phytoplankton primary production has been revealed in the Rybinsk Reservoir in the period under study.

J	WAGSTAFF, WH; SOLTERO, RA				WAGSTAFF, WH; SOLTERO, RA			THE CAUSE OF CONTINUED HYPOLIMNETIC ANOXIA IN LONG LAKE, WA, FOLLOWING ADVANCED WASTE-WATER TREATMENT BY THE CITY OF SPOKANE	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Long Lake, an impoundment of the Spokane River, was eutrophic prior to 1978. Extensive hypolimnetic anoxia, excessive summer algal growth and limited water clarity existed as a result of nutrient loading from the City of Spokane''s primary sewage treatment plant. Advanced wastewater treatment (AWT) began in the fall of 1977 with a process for 85% P removal. Investigations during post-AWT years (1978-1981) have shown significant reductions in P loading with corresponding declines in chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biovolume, primary productivity and increased water clarity to levels characteristic of mesotrophy. However, anoxia has continued to exist, although the degree of anoxia has been considerably less. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between various measures of O2 demand and the phytoplankton community in Long Lake with AWT. Biochemical O2 demand, chemical O2 demand and sediment O2 demand were determined. Sediment O2 demand was measured under stationary and dynamic conditions with a Gilson Differential Respirometer. The areal hypolimnetic O2 demand (AHOD) for all study years was determined. The AHOD calculated for 1981 was less than those calculated for previous study years. Post-AWT mean AHOD was significantly less than pre-AWT mean AHOD. Chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biovolume and primary productivity were positively correlated with AHOD on a volume and areal basis. The phytoplankton community was correlated with O2-demand, both within the water column and at the sediment-water interface, and is thought to be a primary factor in the seasonal decline of dissolved O2 levels in Long Lake.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1984	2	6					615	630		10.1080/02705060.1984.9664645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1984.9664645													WOS:A1984TZ34500012

We demonstrate this in a long-term study of Lake Maggiore, a deep oligomictic lake located in the subalpine lake district in Northern Italy. Studies on physical, chemical and biological features of the lake have been performed continuously since the 1980s. The lake recovered from eutrophication in response to a reduction of catchment nutrient loads and reached a stable oligotrophic status by the end of the 1990s, with average total phosphorus concentrations in the water column around 10 mu g L-1. However, both reactive and total phosphorus have slightly increased since 2010, leading to a shift in the lake trophic state towards mesotrophy. The increase in phosphorus has been limited to the hypolimnetic layers, concentrations being fairly stable or decreasing in the epilimnion. Reactive silica also progressively increased in the hypolimnion, while nitrate and total nitrogen concentrations have steadily decreased in both deep and surface layers, especially in the summer period. These changes were assessed in relation to catchment loads, atmospheric deposition and climate-related variations in stratification and mixing patterns and in nutrient retention. Long-term changes in primary production, represented by chlorophyll levels, and biovolume of the main algal groups were also considered. During the eutrophication period and until the 1990s. in-lake phosphorus concentrations were tightly related to external loads; successively, phosphorus and its vertical distribution up the water column became more controlled by internal processes, in particular by stratification and mixing regime. An increase of thermal stability and a reduced frequency and intensity of deep mixing events has fostered oxygen depletion and phosphorus and silica accumulation in the hypolimnion. Another consequence of reduced deep mixing events has been a reduction in nutrient replenishment of the upper layers at spring mixing. External loads are still the main driver of change for nitrogen compounds: the decrease in the atmospheric load of nitrogen that occurred in the Lake Maggiore area over the last decade, as an effect of reduced nitrogen emissions, has caused decreasing concentration of inorganic nitrogen in the lake. However, the phytoplankton community changes observed might also play a role in nitrogen dynamics, particularly in the nitrate minima observed during summer in recent years.					; Dresti, Claudia/ITT-6857-2023; Marchetto, Aldo/H-3258-2013; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; Austoni, Martina/IXD-7503-2023; Kamburska, Lyudmila/ABG-2391-2020	Dresti, Claudia/0000-0002-0666-1278; Kamburska, Lyudmila/0000-0001-5071-6953; Austoni, Martina/0000-0002-8214-1442; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2021	80	3							2051	10.4081/jlimnol.2021.2051	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2021.2051													WOS:000752953000013

Dietary breadth and somatic growth rate have important ramifications for survival, competitiveness, and dispersal ability of a fish species, and thereby its ecological impact. We studied diet and growth of age-0 tubenose goby within the St. Louis River, a tributary to Lake Superior that contains the largest population within the Lake Superior basin. We sampled tubenose gobies from shallow, vegetated habitats during summer and fall. Stomach contents were identified and weighed to measure fullness and dietary breadth between seasons and several locations. We aged fish based on otolith daily increments to model somatic growth. Diet was dominated by isopods and amphipods, and dietary breadth was low and not significantly different between locations and seasons. Tubenose goby diet strongly overlapped with that of tadpole madtom (Noturus gyrinus), a native, demersal species. We tested several candidate growth models; the Gompertz growth function was the most parsimonious model among those examined. The model demonstrates that tubenose goby obtains a small maximum size and is short-lived. We conclude that tubenose goby presents a unique risk to the Great Lakes and other freshwater bodies because their life history is typical of invasive species, their diet overlaps with native fish, and because they occupy shallow, vegetated habitat which functions as both nursery and foraging habitat for many native fishes.

J	Ellis, KG; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP				Ellis, KG; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP			Deglacial to middle Holocene (16,600 to 6000 calendar years BP) climate change in the northeastern United States inferred from multi-proxy stable isotope data, Seneca Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Climate change in the northeastern United States has been inferred for the last deglaciation to middle Holocene (similar to16,600 to 6000 calendar years ago) using multi-proxy data ( total organic matter, total carbonate content, delta(18)O calcite and delta(13)C calcite) from a 5 m long sediment core from Seneca Lake, New York. Much of the regional postglacial warming occurred during the well-known Bolling and Allerod warm periods (similar to14.5 to 13.0 ka), but climate amelioration in the northeastern United States preceded that in Greenland by similar to2000 years. An Oldest Dryas climate event (similar to15.1 to 14.7 ka) is recognized in Seneca Lake as is a brief Older Dryas (similar to14.1 ka) cold event. This latter cold event correlates with the regional expansion of glacial Lake Iroquois and global meltwater pulse IA. An increase in winter precipitation and a shorter growing season likely characterized the northeastern United States at this time. The Intra-Allerod Cold Period (similar to13.2 ka) is also evident supporting an "Amphi-Atlantic Oscillation'' at this time. The well-known Younger Dryas cold interval occurred in the northeastern United States between 12.9 and 11.6 ka, consistent with ice core data from Greenland. In the Seneca Lake record, however, the Younger Dryas appears as an asymmetric event characterized by an abrupt, high-amplitude beginning followed by a more gradual recovery. Compared to European records, the Younger Dryas in the northeastern United States was a relatively low-amplitude event. The largest amplitude and longest duration anomaly in the Seneca Lake record occurs after the Younger Dryas, between similar to11.6 and 10.3 ka. This "post-Younger Dryas climate interval'' represents the last deglacial climate event prior to the start of the Holocene in the northeastern United States, but has not been recognized in Greenland or Europe. The early to middle Holocene in the northeastern United States was characterized by low-amplitude climate variability. A general warming trend during the Holocene Hypsithermal peaked at similar to9 ka coincident with maximum summer insolation controlled by orbital parameters. Millennial-to century-scale variability is also evident in the Holocene Seneca Lake record, including the well-known 8.2 ka cold event (as well as events at similar to7.1 and 6.6 ka). Hemispherical cooling during the Holocene Neoglacial in the northeastern United States began similar to5.5 ka in response to decreasing summer insolation.

J	Jeffries, MO; Morris, K				Jeffries, MO; Morris, K			Instantaneous daytime conductive heat flow through snow on lake ice in Alaska	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					62nd Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 07-10, 2005	Waterloo, CANADA					The instantaneous daytime conductive heat flow through the snow on lake ice was derived from snow depth, temperature and density measurements made during the course of six winters at MST Pond in central Alaska. The MST Pond data for winter 2003-04 are compared with results for the same period at six other sites (Barrow, Nome, Amos Lakes, Fairbanks, Wasilla, Seward) in Alaska. The maximum heat flow at MST Pond has varied between -19.5 and -8.8 W m(-2). Each winter, the heat flow decreases as the total thickness of snow and ice increases with time. Superimposed on this trend are variations due to fluctuating air temperatures. The comparison of the MST Pond data with the other locations in Alaska reveals heat flow differences that reflect different weather conditions, particularly air temperature and wind, and the latter's effect on snow depth and density. Notwithstanding the regional differences, the heat flow values are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained for sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctica. The implications for the total winter conductive heat loss at large lakes and for regions where many small lakes cover a large proportion of the land are discussed.

We used a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional, hydrodynamic-ecosystem model [General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)-framework for aquatic biogeochemical models (FABM)-PCLake] to determine the influence of extreme climate events on a temperate and temporarily summer stratified lake (Lake Bryrup, Denmark). The model was calibrated (eight years data) and validated (two years data), and the modeled variables generally showed good agreement with observations. Then, a span of extreme warming scenarios was designed based on weather data from the heatwave seen over northern Europe in May-July 2018, mimicking situations of extreme warming returning every year, every three years, and every five years in summer and all year round, respectively. We found only modest impacts of the extreme climate events on nutrient levels, which in some scenarios decreased slightly when looking at the annual mean. The most significant impacts were found for phytoplankton, where summer average chlorophyll a concentrations and cyanobacteria biomass peaks were up to 39% and 58% higher than during baseline, respectively. As a result, the phytoplankton to nutrient ratios increased during the heat wave experiments, reflecting an increased productivity and an increased cycling of nutrients in the pelagic. The phytoplankton blooms occurred up to 15 days earlier and lasted for up to half a month longer during heat wave years relative to the baseline. Our extreme scenarios illustrated and quantified the large impacts of a past heat wave (observed 2018) and may be indicative of the future for many temperate lakes.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; chen, weiyu/M-5972-2018; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Trolle, Dennis/B-5465-2008; Andersen, Tobias/JPA-4200-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Hu, Fenjuan Rose Schmidt/0000-0002-4429-3066; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201; 														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							94	10.3390/w12010094	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010094													WOS:000519847200094

The chemical compositions invariably revealed a HCO3-Ca hydrochemical facies; however slight differences were observed among the lakes, in relation to the lithologies distinguishing each lakes'drainage basin. Elemental ratios and in particular the Rb/Sr provide a discriminative tool to recognize the rocks that have been weathered; for example this ratio is high in water that interacted with volcanic ignimbrites (rhyolites), and low in rocks that interacted with carbonate rocks. Many other trace elements were analyzed, thus providing baseline data, and only arsenic displayed concentrations higher than the legislative threshold defined for drinking water (10 mu g/l), especially in Lake Levico (10-19 mu g/l). As concerns the stable isotopes delta D and delta O-18, the obtained results approach the meteoric signature for waters sampled during the 2012 winter season. The waters sampled during two summers (2011 and 2012) displayed distinctive trends, reflecting the significant influence of evaporative processes. We emphasize that the annual differences recorded in the isotopic composition of distinct years are plausibly related to temperature changes and type of precipitation that recharged the lakes. In this light, the peculiar isotopic signature recorded in the year 2011 is possibly related to a significant snowy period, which greatly contributed to the lakes' water budget. Interestingly, waters from Lake Santa Colomba were systematically different from all the other samples, possibly due to more effective evaporative processes, or to the involvement of deep underground recharge including fossil waters.

Previous studies have indicated that PCMs are introduced to aquatic environments via wastewater and river discharge. Polyethylene passive samplers (PEs) were deployed in air and water during winter 2011 and summer 2012 to investigate the role of population centers as sources of these contaminants to the Great Lakes and determine whether the lakes were acting as sources of PCMs via volatilization. Average gaseous S5PCM ranged from below detection limits (<DL) to 3.2 ng/m(3) on the western shoreline of Lake Erie in Toledo. Average dissolved S5PCM ranged from <DL to 2.6 ng/L on the southern shore of Lake Ontario near the mouth of the Oswego River. Significant correlations were observed between population density and S5PCM in both air and water, with strongest correlations within a 25 and 40 km radius, respectively. At sites where HHCB was detected it was generally volatilizing, while the direction of AHTN airwater exchange was variable. Volatilization fluxes of HHCB ranged from 11 +/- 6 to 341 +/- 127 ng/m(2)/day, while airwater exchange fluxes of AHTN ranged from -3 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 10 ng/m(2)/day. Extrapolation of average airwater exchange flux values over the surface area of the lakes coastal boundary zone suggested volatilization may be responsible for the loss of 64213 kg/year of dissolved S5PCM from the lakes.					; Lohmann, Rainer/B-1511-2008; Helm, Paul/ABC-1534-2021; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; McDonough, Carrie/HLG-7161-2023	Lohmann, Rainer/0000-0001-8796-3229; McDonough, Carrie/0000-0001-5152-8495; Helm, Paul/0000-0002-7462-4217													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 1	2016	50	21					11575	11583		10.1021/acs.est.6b03657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b03657								27679873					WOS:000386991100017

In this chapter, we describe an observational epidemiologic study that collected surveillance data on local environmental changes and associated health outcomes from residents of communities in Northwest, Interior, and Southeast Alaska. To assess the health effects of climate change in Alaska, two rounds of sentinel surveillance data were collected for 12 months, each on unusual weather conditions and the health outcomes associated with those conditions in three ecologically-distinct regions of the state. Qualitative data was also collected utilizing in-depth interviews and community meetings with community residents. We evaluated statistical associations between two exposures; unusual weather conditions and participant changes in travel as a result of unusual weather conditions, with a variety of health outcomes and health outcome mediators. Qualitative responses were analyzed to better understand these associations. We found significant associations between unusual weather conditions and cold-related morbidity and mortality in two rounds of surveillance data collection across the state. The nature and timing of such outcomes were seasonal in nature, and indicated health outcomes from the increasing prevalence of icy conditions in winter, and unusually warm and dry conditions in summer, in northwest and central regions of Alaska. Further, discussions of the surveillance data with local residents provided insights into prospective causal relationships between environmental events and the health outcomes described.																			2367-3397	2367-3400	978-3-319-30626-1; 978-3-319-30624-7				2016							117	133		10.1007/978-3-319-30626-1_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30626-1_6	10.1007/978-3-319-30626-1												WOS:000478777400007

The altered flow regimes substantially influence plant growth in the water level fluctuation zone, impacting both vegetation patterns and success. The relationships among above-ground vegetation, soil seed bank and soil microorganisms remain unexamined. This study was performed in Lashi Lake, a plateau lake in southern China characterized by anti-seasonal water level fluctuations, and Jizi Reservoir, a reference site exhibiting natural seasonal water level variations. The primary aim was to assess the distribution pattern of plant, soil seed bank and their corresponding soil microorganism over the three flood gradients, and the relationships among them were analysed simultaneously. The findings indicated that both plant community variety and seed bank diminished as the area of soil flooding increased. The soil seed bank was a strong indication of community diversity, particularly throughout late spring and late summer. Additionally, significant correlations between the alpha diversity of soil microorganisms and the concentrations of soil carbon, nitrogen and moisture were found across the flooding gradients. The organization and diversity of soil microbial communities were significantly correlated with the alpha diversity of the plant community and the soil seed bank. The findings demonstrate that both seed banks and soil bacteria play a dynamic role in the restoration of vegetation in areas experiencing anti-seasonal water fluctuations.

This may be related to the occurrence of a Microcystis bloom in Lake Taihu in the summer and autumn every year. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the contaminated water from the Microcystis bloom and the derivative pollutant microcystin-LR (MC-LR) can explain the higher incidences of T2DM. Healthy male mice were fed with water from different regions of Lake Taihu, and were either acutely or chronically exposed to MC-LR through oral administration or intraperitoneal injection. Serum lipid profiles were determined, and the effects on T2DM-related gene expression and insulin receptor signaling pathway were investigated. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance (IPGTT) and insulin resistance (IRT) tests were implemented, and the functions of pancreatic islet and beta-cell were also evaluated. The results showed that both water sampled from the region with a Microcysis bloom and those containing MC-LR altered the serum glucide and lipid profiles in mice after exposure. The exposure to a Microcysis bloom water affected the expression T2DM-related genes: up-regulated the mRNA levels of FASn, ACACA, G6pc, LPL, and Insig2, and down-regulated the mRNA level of PEPCK and Gsk-3 beta. Both acute and chronic exposure of MC-LR, even at very low concentrations (1 mu g/L), impaired the insulin receptor signalling pathway and induced hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in mice. In this study, the most important intracellular target of MC-LR was found to be hetapocellular mitochondria. Thus, exposure to Microcystis bloom water containing microcystin-LR can induce the incidence of T2DM, by impairing the function of mitochondria by microcystin-LR. The study suggests a review of the risk assessment concerning 1 mu g/L MC-LR as the reference dose in surface water.

Mysis zooplanktivory in Lake Champlain: A bioenergetics analysis	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysid shrimp are important both as predators on zooplankton and as prey for a variety of fish species across most of the Laurentian Great Lakes. In Lake Champlain, where little is known about mysids, this may also be true. We evaluated the role of Mysis diluviana as a planktivore in Lake Champlain using hydroacoustics, gut content analysis, stable isotopes, cohort analysis, and bioenergetics models to estimate Mysis density, diets, growth rates, and prey consumption rates. Density of Mysis in the water column of the deeper Main Lake was lower in July August of 2008-2011 (38, 38, 21, and 74 Mysis/m(2), respectively) than historical values from the 1970s. Mysis selectively foraged for cladocerans, but also consumed cyclopoid and calanoid copepods in 2011. Stable isotope data suggest a mostly carnivorous diet, although agreement between isotope mixing models and observed diets varied. Cohort analyses revealed growth rates ranging from 2.7 mm/month in late spring to 13 mm/month in late summer. In contrast to the offshore areas of Lake Ontario and Lake Huron, zooplankton consumption by the Mysis population was low relative to zooplankton density and production indicating that Mysis are not currently a major zooplanktivore in Lake Champlain.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF THE LIFE-CYCLE OF THE NET-SPINNING CADDIS PHILOPOTAMUS-MONTANUS (TRICHOPTERA, PHILOPOTAMIDAE) IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The life cycle of P. montanus (Donovan) took 1 yr in a small, stony stream in the English Lake District. The flight period was from April-June; oviposition occurred underwater. There were 5 larval instars and larvae reached instar IV or V by Nov. Fifth instars overwintered in pupal cases and pupated in spring; 4th instars grew rapidly to instar V in spring and then pupated. Males emerged about 2 wk before females and both sexes emerged chiefly at night. As the sample variance-mean relationship followed Taylor''s Power Law, the spatial distribution of larvae and pupae was density dependent. Relative clumping remained fairly constant through instars II-IV, decreased slightly in instar V and increased markedly for prepupae and pupae. Growth was highly variable in early instars (May and June), fastest in July and Aug. (6.0-7.5% dry weight day-1) and lower but fairly constant subsequently with no decrease in winter (0.6-0.9% day-1). Production [P] was highest when growth rates were highest. Although estimates of production and standing crop varied considerably, their ratios were less variable, especially for the whole population (mean annual value of P/.hivin.B [Biomass] ratio = 3.7). Life tables were simlar in 3 yr-classes. The initial population had decreased by 90% by instar II. Less than 2% completed the life cycle and < 0.4% laid eggs. When instars II and V were searching for net and pupation sites, respectively, some larvae drifted downstream and were lost from the population. There was no evident upstream movement of adults or larvae to compensate for these losses and the population was thus self-contained. The life cycle took 1 yr in 2 neighboring streams. There was a downstream movement of larvae, especially in instars II and V. In contrast to the previous stream, there was strong evidence in both streams for a compensatory upstream flight by females so that eggs were laid chiefly in the upper reaches of the stream.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1981	50	3					867	883		10.2307/4143	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4143													WOS:A1981MK43000017
J	Taran, YA; Peiffer, L				Taran, Yuri A.; Peiffer, Loic			Hydrology, hydrochemistry and geothermal potential of El Chichon volcano-hydrothermal system, Mexico	GEOTHERMICS												Fluid and heat discharge rates of thermal springs of El Chichon volcano were measured using the chloride inventory method. Four of the five known groups of hot springs discharge near-neutral Na-Ca-Cl-SO4 waters with a similar composition (Cl similar to 1500-2000 mg kg(-1) and Cl/SO4 similar to 3) and temperatures in the 50-74 degrees C range. The other group discharges acidic (pH 2.2-2.7) Na-Cl water of high salinity (>15 g/L). All five groups are located on the volcano slopes, 2-3 kin in a straight line from the bottom of the volcano crater. They are in the upper parts of canyons where thermal waters mix with surface meteoric waters and form thermal streams. All these streams flow into the Rio Magdalena, which is the only drainage of all thermal waters coming from the volcano. The total Cl and SO4 discharges measured in the Rio Magdalena downstream from its junction with all the thermal streams are very close to the sum of the transported Cl and S04 by each of these streams, indicating that the infiltration through. the river bed is low. The net discharge rate of hydrothermal Cl measured for all thermal springs is about 468 g s(-1). which corresponds to 234 kg s(-1) of hot water with Cl = 2000 mg kg(-1). Together with earlier calculations of the hydrothermal steam output from the volcano crater, the total natural heat output from El Chichon is estimated to be about 160 MWt. Such a high and concentrated discharge of thermal waters from a hydrothermal system is not common and may indicate the high geothermal potential of the system. For the deep water temperatures in the 200-250 degrees C range (based on geothermometry), and a mass flow rate of 234 kg s(-1), the total heat being discharged by the upflowing hot waters may be 175-210 MWt.

The water-level fluctuation is regulated against the normal seasonal flooding with summer emergence and winter submergence. We investigated the seed rain and soil seed banks along elevational gradients of the Xiangxi zone in the reservoir to explore the characteristics of species composition and spatial distribution of seed rain and soil seed bank, and their similarities with standing vegetation under the regulated water-level fluctuation. The results showed that the seed rain and soil seed bank comprised 36 and 50 species of plants, respectively. These were predominantly annual herbaceous plants, which accounted for 54.02 and 66.0% of the seed rain and soil seed bank, respectively, with an average density of 445.16 +/- 49.97 and 7322.18 +/- 678.44 seeds/m(2), respectively. The regulated water-level fluctuation resulted in greater species diversity and seed density of seed rain and soil seed bank in the middle and upper elevations of the zone than that of the lower elevations. The similarity coefficient between seed rain and seed bank, seed bank and extant vegetation, seed rain and extant vegetation was 0.488, 0.373 and 0.466, respectively. Effects of the regulated water-level fluctuation on the species compositions and spatial distribution of the seed rain and seed bank, and their similarities with existing vegetation were further discussed by contrast with the current research in the same field.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2020	35	1					57	71		10.1080/02705060.2019.1670744	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2019.1670744													WOS:000510206200001
J	TRIFONOVA, I				TRIFONOVA, I			SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND ITS DIVERSITY IN 2 HIGHLY EUTROPHIC LAKES WITH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF STRATIFICATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass, its diversity and its photosynthetic activity in two highly eutrophic lakes have been compared. In order to test the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the lakes have been chosen with almost the same level of trophy but different conditions of stratification, through two ice-free periods of open water with different weather conditions. High phytoplankton diversity throughout the period of investigation was characteristic for the shallower Lake Lobardzu. The number of species here was usually more than 30 and the Shannon diversity changed from 1.2 to 4.2. Owing to the frequent external disturbances, periods characterized by autogenic succession with establishing dominance and declining diversity alternated with periods of biomass reduction and rises of diversity and photosynthetic activity. In the warmer summer of 1983, with more intense warming of bottom layers and predominance of blue-greens, phytoplankton biomass was higher and diversity lower than in the cold summer of 1982. In stratified Lake Rudusku, phytoplankton diversity and number of species were usually much lower. During the long summer stratification up to three-four dominant species of blue-greens and dinoflagellates become established and competitive exclusion leading to low diversity advanced. Some changes in biomass and diversity, were caused by zooplankton activity.

In this study, the occurrence, spatial and seasonal distribution and characteristics of microplastics (MPs) were investigated for the first time in Lake Hazar (T & uuml;rkiye), an important recreational lake. Water, sediment and fish (Capoeta umbla) were sampled from the lake in the winter and summer of 2020. Thereafter, the MPs were extracted from the samples using the density separation method. Their abundance, shape, color, and size were determined microscopically, while the polymer types were analyzed using ATR-FTIR. The MPs were detected in all surface water and sediment samples, while they were detected in the gastrointestinal tracts of 28 (35 %) out of 80 fish samples. The abundance of MPs was 74-1091 items/m(3) for the surface water, 88-213 items/kg (ww) for sediments and 0-5 items/fish for C. umbla, respectively. The MP concentrations in water samples from the shore sites were found to be significantly higher than those in limnetic sites (p < 0.05). The most common MP shapes, sizes and colors were fragments, <0.5 mm and white/transparent, respectively. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most common polymer types, indicating that recreational activities and fishing activities may be the main sources of MPs in the lake. The Pollution Load Index results indicated that MP pollution in the lake's water and sediments was at a moderate level.

Wyatt			Weak precipitation? 2H response to large Holocene hydroclimate changes in eastern North America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In eastern North America, annual precipitation increased by >40% over the Holocene, largely in response to melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The change substantially raised lake levels and transformed conifer-dominated ecosystems into mesic deciduous forests. 82H values of terrestrially derived leaf-wax n-alkanes can facilitate diagnoses of the climate dynamics involved by reconstructing 82H values of mean annual precipitation (82HMAP). However, competing influences on 82HMAP values in the mid-latitudes, such as changes in moisture sources and in the seasonal distribution of precipitation, can generate confounding effects. To test 82HMAP sensitivity to potential changes associated with the final Holocene phases of deglaciation in eastern North America, we used 14 fossil-pollen records to reconstruct monthly precipitation changes and to model 82HMAP values during the Holocene. The pollen-inferred precipitation increased by 100e20 0 mm during both cold and warm seasons, but modeled 82HMAP values changed by only-10 parts per thousand, because isotopically-heavy summer precipitation increased by nearly as much as the cold-season isotopically-light winter precipitation. Three new leaf wax n-C29-alkane (82HC29) records span-ning the Holocene from Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts closely follow modeled 82HMAP trends and confirm only a small decline in 82HMAP values over the Holocene. Because the shifts in pre-cipitation seasonality accurately predict the n-alkane records, changes in moisture sources or pathways appear to play only a minor role in the regional 82HMAP history despite the effects of deglaciation on atmospheric circulation. Soil evaporation also did not significantly alter 82HC29 values from the values predicted using the pollen-derived reconstructions. The results affirm that 82HC29 values faithfully detected anticipated isotopic changes in 82HMAP values, but that important paleoclimate events may not always yield strong changes in 82HMAP values.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The 3 dams shared a number of physico-chemical characteristics although they differed markedly in trophic state and morphology. The results of the P mass-balances are expressed in terms of both a real and volumetric loading as well as in tonnage loading. The trophic state compared favorably with P loading, but was influenced by water retention times. The Vollenweider-type graphic models might require modification if used in tropical conditions.

J	Jernej, R				Jernej, Renate			Stone Mounds in Lake Wörthersee and Lake Ossiacher See. Deposits of Stones in Shallow Water Zones as Fishing Aids	ARCHAEOLOGIA AUSTRIACA												In the Swiss part of Lake Constance, depth measurements in 2013- 2015 led to the discovery of over 170 stone structures with diameters between 15 and 30 metres. Archaeological investigations did not provide a clear interpretation, but the Neolithic period is suggested as a dating. The speculations ranged from prehistoric burial places to astronomical systems. Similar cairns have long been known from Lake Zug (Switzerland) and - albeit much smaller structures with diameters between 2.6 and 10 metres - from Lake Worthersee and Lake Ossiacher See (Carinthia, Austria). In the Carinthian lakes they were first described in 1864 in the course of research into pile dwellings. In the context of the present work, the stone structures were mapped using aerial photographs. In addition, former com-mercial fishermen were interviewed as contemporary witnesses. The function of the hills in the two Carinthian lakes can be clearly located in the area of fishing. The rocks were piled up on the ice in winter, collapsed in spring and then served as spawning grounds to attract fish, which thus became prey. A dating of the artificially raised cairns (at least 60 in Lake Worthersee and at least 93 in Lake Ossiacher See) is not possible.																			0003-8008	1816-2959					2023		107					223	240		10.1553/archaeologia107s223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1553/archaeologia107s223													WOS:001128533900006

We assessed the use of phytoplankton pigment profiling as a potential indicator of stratification conditions in temperate lakes in South-Central Chile. Spring and early summer phytoplankton pigment profiles and the physical and chemical limnology were analyzed in 43 lakes ranging in size, depth, altitude and catchment characteristics. Eleven lakes were sampled during both seasons. Variation in pigment composition between lakes was primarily related to stratification conditions and mixed layer light availability at the time of sampling. The dinoflagellate marker pigment peridinin was more abundant in more deeply mixed lakes with a lower mean irradiance, while chlorophyte pigments (chlorophyll b, lutein) tended to be higher in shallow (high-light) epilimnia. Diatom and chrysophyte pigments (fucoxanthin) dominated under less thermally stable and more variable light conditions. Cyanobacteria pigments (zeaxanthin), probably derived from picocyanobacteria, were relatively more abundant in very transparent, low productive lakes. Lakes in close vicinity of active volcanoes were enriched in silica and PO4-P and characterised by elevated chlorophyte marker pigments. Within strongly stratified lakes, in which the euphoric zone extended into the hypolimnion, cryptophyte pigments (alloxanthin) characterized the deep chlorophyll maxima while the epilimnion was consistently enriched with the photo-protective xanthophyll-cycle pigment violaxanthin. We conclude that major algal groups, represented by pigment biomarkers, are largely driven by changes in lake water column stratification and related mixed layer light availability as well as nutrient concentrations in temperate Chilean freshwater lakes.

Methane (58-64%), ammonium (10-13%), iron (2-6%), and sulfide (< 12%) oxidation accounted for approximately 75% of the oxygen consumed in the profundal sediments. Almost the complete diffusive flux of CH4 out of the anoxic layer into the oxic surface layer (7.9-9.4 mmol m-2 d-1) was oxidized, while only 27-36% of the NH4+ flux (5.1-5.2 mmol m-2 d-1) was oxidized in the oxic surface layer and 64-73% diffused into the overlying water. In contrast to the profundal sediments, oxidation of reduced end products of anoxic respiration was of minor importance (< 15%) in littoral sandy sediments. Also, sediment oxygen consumption rate was higher in the profundal gyttja (29 mmol m-2 d-1 at 7-degrees-C) during overturn than in the littoral sandy sediments in both winter (8.7 mmol m-2 d-1 at 7-degrees-C) and summer (18.6 mmol m-2 d-1 at 22-degrees-C). Poisoning the sediment cores with formaldehyde stopped bacterial activity, but oxygen profile measurements showed that this treatment does not reveal the bacterial or chemical nature of the oxidative processes.																			0024-3590					SEP	1991	36	6					1124	1133		10.4319/lo.1991.36.6.1124	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.6.1124													WOS:A1991GW01500005

Eye-catching orderly patterns such as vertically spiralling moisture columns and undulating fog patterns observed over lakes and large rivers at elevated surface temperature arouse public and research curiosity, but the understanding of the underlying physics and identifying the effects of such events on the human comfort and local air quality still pose a challenge. This paper provides a brief overview of the current strategies in computer simulation and modelling of buoyancy-driven microclimate phenomena. The niches and limitations of the large-eddy simulations (LES) are briefly discussed and the focus is turned to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods currently prevailing as the most rational approach for predicting microclimate over realistic terrains and urban canopies. A time-resolved ensemble-averaged (T-RANS) three-equation algebraic stress/flux model (ASFM k-e-.2) with the novel buoyancy-accounting functions for the ground boundary conditions, validated in a range of generic and engineering buoyant flows, is shown to reproduces the orderly structures observed over a real urban terrain with a large river acting as a strong localized source of heat and moisture. The model was subsequently applied to study the river-induced seasonal variation of the traffic-emitted CO distribution over the same city showing acceptable agreement with the field measurements.																					978-1-56700-523-3				2022							1	10																WOS:001540784400001

Interannual Variability of Methane Storage and Emission During Autumn Overturn in a Small Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Methane emissions from freshwater systems, and especially from small lakes, source a significant proportion of naturally produced atmospheric methane. In small temperate lakes, storage flux, that is, the diffusive emission of methane that was stored in anoxic waters during the seasonal overturn of the water column, can contribute a large fraction of annual methane emissions. Here, we use an extensive field data set to quantify methane storage in anoxic deep water and identify as well as quantify the sources and losses of this methane. The comparison of measurements from 4 years in a small temperate lake (Illmensee) shows that methane storage can differ substantially between years. In 2012 and 2018, the annual maximum of the methane stored in the entire water column was around twice as high (5,350 and 5,822 kg) as in 2013 and 2017 (2,722 and 2,295 kg). A methane mass balance approach suggests that the variability of methane storage in the anoxic water between the years was not caused by the methane flux at the anoxic-oxic water interface, but rather was related to changes in the methane source from the anoxic sediments. The interannual differences in sediment flux could not be explained by sediment temperature, but rather by the differing supply of organic matter. Our findings suggest that phytoplankton blooms promote methane storage within the same year and thus cause interannual variability in emissions during autumn overturn.					; Ragg, Ramona/HSH-5969-2023	Teiber-Siessegger, Petra/0000-0001-9918-2884; Hofmann, Hilmar/0000-0001-6140-5886													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JG006388	10.1029/2021JG006388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006388													WOS:000734472100008

For effective management, information is needed on reproductive success and year-class strength, which entails an understanding of the distribution, abundance, and food habits of age-0 and age-1 fish. Sampling was conducted during the late summer and autumn of 1998 and 1999 in a 39.4-km portion of the upper reservoir from river kilometer 3042.5 to 3003.1. Counts of age-0 and age-1 paddlefish indicated that abundance was low in 1998 and even lower in 1999. During 1998, higher numbers of age-0 paddlefish were more often observed near rkm 3024 during late July and early August. By late August, higher counts of age-0 paddlefish shifted to down-reservoir areas where zooplankton abundance had increased from up-reservoir areas. Significant correlations were found between age-0 fish abundance and two of the six habitat measurements; age-0 fish abundance was positively correlated with wave height and negatively correlated with current velocity. Food habits of wild, age-0 and age-1 paddlefish were investigated in July-September, 1998 and 1999. The stomach contents of age-0 and age-1 paddlefish indicated that these age-classes fed selectively, and the diet was composed of some of the larger organisms available. In up-reservoir areas, paddlefish fed heavily on chironomid larvae displaced by wave action or river currents, whereas those paddlefish collected from down-reservoir areas selected for Leptodora kindtii.																			0175-8659					DEC	2002	18	4-6					601	607		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00396.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00396.x													WOS:000179913400058

To better understand the role of zooplankton in modulating cyanobacteria blooms, from 2008 to 2010 we measured water quality and plankton abundance, and measured feeding rates and prey selectivity of the copepod Diacyclops thomasi before, during and following summertime cyanobacteria blooms in a shallow, eutrophic lake (Vancouver Lake, Washington, USA). We used a combined field and experimental approach to specifically test the hypothesis that copepod grazing was a significant factor in establishing the timing of cyanobacteria bloom initiation and eventual decline in Vancouver Lake. There was a consistent annual succession of zooplankton taxa, with cyclopoid copepods (D. thomasi) dominant in spring, followed by small cladocerans (Eubosmina sp.). Before each cyanobacteria bloom, large cladocerans (Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia laevis) peaked in abundance but quickly disappeared, followed by brief increases in rotifers. During the cyanobacteria blooms, D. thomasi was again dominant, with small cladocerans abundant in autumn. Before the cyanobacteria blooms, D. thomasi substantially consumed ciliates and dinoflagellates (up to 100% of prey biomass per day), which likely allowed diatoms to flourish. A shift in copepod grazing toward diatoms before the blooms may have then helped to facilitate the rapid increase in cyanobacteria. Copepod grazing impact was the highest during the cyanobacteria blooms both years, but focused on non-cyanobacteria prey; copepod grazing was minimal as the cyanobacteria blooms waned. We conclude that cyclopoid copepods may have an indirect role (via trophic cascades) in modulating cyanobacteria bloom initiation, but do not directly contribute to cyanobacteria bloom decline.

J	Wood, WW; Stokes, S; Rich, J				Wood, WW; Stokes, S; Rich, J			Implications of water supply for indigenous Americans during Holocene aridity phases on the Southern High Plains, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Springs in the 40 to 50 large lake basins (>15 km(2)) on the southern portion of the Southern High Plains (SHP) were active during periods of aridity in the Holocene when there may have been human habitation of the area. Eolian erosion of the lake floors and lunette accretion occurred as groundwater levels declined in response to decreased groundwater recharge. The declining lake floor associated with eolian erosion allowed groundwater evaporative discharge to continue, thus maintaining a groundwater gradient toward the lake. This hydrologic condition was favorable for a relatively continuous spring discharge to the lake, independent of the elevation of the lake floor. To evaluate the postulated dynamic equilibrium critical to this conclusion, 17 optically stimulated ages were determined from a 17.7-m deep core of a lunette adjacent to Double Lakes, Texas (33degrees13'15"N, 101degrees54'08"W). The core yielded sediment accumulation dates of 11,500 +/- 1100, 6500 +/- 700, and 4900 +/- 500 yr B.P., corresponding broadly with periods of aridity known from other evidence. Based on analysis of this lunette, it is concluded that springs in Double Lakes basin probably existed throughout the Holocene with discharges similar to those observed historically. We assumed that similar dynamic equilibrium existed in the other large lake basins in the SHP and that these springs could have provided a continuous source of water for indigenous peoples during periods of prolonged aridity. The dynamic equilibrium that is proposed in this study is applicable not only to other and and semiarid geographic areas with wind-erodible material but also over different geologic times.

The runoffs from the deicing operation have a deteriorating effect on water quality. The existence of salt super saturated Urmia lake and easy access to it, causes Urmia municipality to over use the super saturated water of this lake and salt (NaCl) during winter for snow melting, freezing prevention and traffic load facilitation. The aim of this study was investigation of surface and groundwater contaminations in consequence of salt (NaCl) and saline water usage in Urmia city and its surroundings. Studying the chloride ion concentration as a tracer in runoff result snowmelts during winter shows that its amount is differential with respect to time and place sampling. Results indicate that runoff result of snowmelts effected groundwater, soil and plant growth. The contamination of groundwater in study area by road salt and saline water is a slow process and directly related to the amount of road salt and saline water applied.					; Aghazadeh, Nosrat/ABC-7822-2020	Aghazadeh, Nosrat/0000-0002-0831-4237; 													1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL	2012	5	4					565	570		10.1007/s12517-010-0210-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-010-0210-6													WOS:000305744400003

They are generally overlain by younger sediments of different origin, mainly related to periglacial and slope wash processes. Depending on their genesis and composition, 3 types of slope deposits can be distinguished, which are classified as units 1, 2a and 2b. Unit 1 is characterized by its wide spatial occurrence and a constant thickness of 40-60 cm, high silt contents, and a sharp lithological discontinuity to the lying sediments, generally forming the parent material for the Ah- and Al-horizons of the Luvisols. Unit 2 represents erosion rills, filled up with loess loam and some gravel (< 5%) due to slope wash. Locally, periglacial deformations led to cryoturbatic structures in these sediments, which is used to differentiate between unit 2a (no indications for periglacial activities) and unit 2b (with cryoturbatlons). Based on stratigraphic assumptions, the formation of unit 1 has been tentatively attributed to the Younger Dryas. Optical Stimulated Luminescence and radiocarbon dating of unit 2 indicate morphodynamic activity during the Early Holocene up to 7.5 ka, suggesting an open landscape. This scenario is in conflict with the established notion that reforestation in Middle Europe took place during the Bolling-Allerod warm period. In order to explain this apparent contradiction for the Younger Dryas to Early Holocene environment, we suggest a continental climate with dry summers and drought stress on the vegetation, in combination with very cold winters and deep soil frost at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, caused by the orbital precession maximum. After 7.5 ka, with the spread of oceanic woodland and reduced seasonal contrasts, the landscape stabilized and soils developed.					; Wüthrich, Lorenz/AAE-2384-2020	Wuthrich, Lorenz/0000-0001-8397-6612; Preusser, Frank/0000-0002-5654-1346													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2017	158						102	112		10.1016/j.catena.2017.06.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.06.012													WOS:000412252200011

HOLOCENE												Knowledge of the millennial abrupt monsoon failures is critical to understanding the related causes. Here, we extracted proxy indices of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensity during the early to mid-Holocene, from peat deposits at Lake Xihu, in southwestern China. There are a series of abrupt, millennial-scale episodes of ISM weakening inferred from the Lake Xihu records, which are generally synchronous with those inferred from other archives over ISM areas. An important feature is that the ISM failures inferred from the Lake Xihu proxy indices synchronize well with abrupt changes in solar activity. We argue that changes in solar activity play a primary role in producing most of these millennial ISM failures, while some other causes, including freshwater outbursts into the North Atlantic Ocean and changes in sea surface temperatures of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, may have also exerted influences on parts of the millennial ISM failures.

We introduce a novel Bayesian method that can be used to quantify this relationship when the only data available are size-frequency distributions of unmarked individuals measured at two successive time periods. The inverse Gaussian distribution provides a parametric form for the statistical model development, and we use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to evaluate posterior distributions. We illustrate the method using data on threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected before and after the winter season in an Alaskan lake. Our method allows us to compare the intensity of size-biased mortality in different years. We discuss generalizations that include more complicated relationships between size and survival as well as time-series modeling.

Prolonged monsoon droughts and links to Indo-Pacific warm pool: A Holocene record from Lonar Lake, central India	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Concerns about the regional impact of global climate change in a warming scenario have highlighted the gaps in our understanding of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM, also referred to as the Indian Ocean summer monsoon) and the absence of long term palaeoclimate data from the central Indian core monsoon zone (CMZ). Here we present the first high resolution, well-dated, multiproxy reconstruction of Holocene palaeoclimate from a 10 m long sediment core raised from the Lonar Lake in central India. We show that while the early Holocene onset of-intensified monsoon in the CMZ is similar to that reported from other ISM records, the Lonar data shows two prolonged droughts (PD, multidecadal to centennial periods of weaker monsoon) between 4.6-3.9 and 2-0.6 cal ka. A comparison of our record with available data from other ISM influenced sites shows that the impact of these PD was observed in varying degrees throughout the ISM realm and coincides with intervals of higher solar irradiance. We demonstrate that (i) the regional warming in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) plays an important role in causing ISM PD through changes in meridional overturning circulation and position of the anomalous Walker cell; (ii) the long term influence of conditions like El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the ISM began only ca. 2 cal ka BP and is coincident with the warming of the southern IPWP; (iii) the first settlements in central India coincided with the onset of the first PD and agricultural populations flourished between the two PD, highlighting the significance of natural climate variability and PD as major environmental factors affecting human settlements.

Current data on lake Peipsi indicate that temperature extremes and synergistic interactions with eutrophication have led to a radical restructuring of the fish community. Commercial landings of lake smelt, Osmerus eperlanus eperlanus m. spirinchus (Pallas), the previous dominant species of the fish community, have decreased dramatically since the 1930s, these declines being coupled with summer heat waves coinciding with low water levels. Gradual decline in smelt stock and catches was significantly related to a decline of near-bottom oxygen conditions and to a decrease in water transparency. The first documented fish kill in 1959 occurred only in the southern, most shallow and eutrophic lake (lake Pihkva). Recently, summer fish kill have become more frequent, involving larger areas of the lake. In addition to the cold-water species, e.g. smelt and vendace Coregonus albula (L.), the abundance of bottom-dwelling fishes such as ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus (L.) and juvenile fish have significantly decreased after the 2010 heat wave probably due to hypoxia and warm water temperatures. This study showed that fish community structure in large shallow lakes may be very vulnerable to water temperature increases, especially temperature extremes in combination with eutrophication.

Peaks in phytoplankton abundance occurred in spring and summer in both lakes, but relationships of biomass and productivity vs light and nutrients differed between the lakes. In Lake Dunstan, P-vs-I parameters indicated that phytoplankton were photo-acclimated to prevailing light conditions. In the Frankton Arm, P-vs-I parameters indicated that phytoplankton were poorly adapted to light conditions. Phytoplankton biomass and productivity were only depressed at the shortest observed hydraulic residence times (< 3 days). Phytoplankton biomass and productivity in Lake Dunstan were predicted from dissolved and particulate nitrogen concentrations and mean mixed-layer light intensity. Annual mean chlorophyll a level was predicted satisfactorily using a published empirical model based on total phosphorus and inorganic suspended solids; a published deterministic model developed for reservoirs was tested and did not predict chlorophyll a concentrations accurately. The results are discussed in the context of the paradigm of trophic upsurge which is commonly observed in newly impounded reservoirs.																			0028-8330					MAR	1997	31	1					119	134		10.1080/00288330.1997.9516749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1997.9516749													WOS:A1997XD91200010

Here we present a detailed multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core from Emerald Lake, located at the montane-subalpine forest transition in west-central Colorado. The record tracks changes in the lake environment, vegetation and fire activity mostly related to climate change for the latest Pleistocene and Holocene, and complements the previously published lake-level reconstruction from the same site. Vegetation and lake level show similar patterns with insolation changes and other regional paleoclimate records for temperature, with coldest conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD), warming in the early Holocene - thermal maximum reached around 6800 cal yr BP - and cooling in the middle and late Holocene. This record also shows how subalpine environments reacted to Holocene moisture dynamics for both summer, related to the North American Monsoon (NAM), and winter precipitation that could be associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), indicating that Emerald Lake was sensitive to long-term and millennial-scale regional and global climate changes. Climatic perturbations, generally cold and/or arid events and low lake levels at ca. 8200, 4200, 1200-1000 cal yr BP influenced the vegetation around Emerald Lake in association with well-known worldwide climatic events.

Using the default lake model parameters, the solution of WRF-Lake exhibits significant biases in both the lake thermodynamics and regional climatology, i.e., higher lake surface temperature (LST), earlier onset of summer thermal stratification, and overestimated near-surface air temperature and precipitation induced by the lake's excessive warming and moistening impacts. The performance of WRF-Lake is improved through adjusting the initial lake temperature profile, the temperature of maximum water density (Tdmax), the surface roughness length, and the light extinction coefficient. Results show that initializing the water temperature with spring observation mitigates the LST overestimation and reduces the timing error of the onset of thermal stratification. By further adjusting Tdmax from 4 degrees C to the observed value of 3.5 degrees C, the LST increase from June to mid-July is enhanced and the buildup of thermal stratification is more accurately predicted. Through incorporating the parameterized surface roughness length and decreasing the light extinction coefficient, the model better reproduces the observed daily evolution of LST and vertical lake temperature profile. The calibrated WRF-Lake effectively mitigates the overestimation of over-lake air temperature at 2 m height and precipitation over regions downwind the lake.

J	Bowell, RJ; Parshley, JV				Bowell, RJ; Parshley, JV			Control of pit-lake water chemistry by secondary minerals, Summer Camp pit, Getchell mine, Nevada	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	NOV, 2000	RENO, NV	Geol Soc Amer				At the Summer Camp pit of the Getchell mine in northern Nevada, the sulfate mineralogy is complex and includes gypsum, jarosite, pickeringite-halotrichite, copiapite, melanterite, langite, and bukovskyite that occur along with scorodite-mansfieldite and Ca-Cu-Zn arsenate minerals. Leaching of these minerals by meteoric water seasonally contributes As, Fe, Ca, trace metals, sulfate, and hydrogen ions to the lake. During the early stages of pit-lake refilling (1991-1993), this mechanism had an important control on water quality in the pit, although over time the effect has lessened as groundwater inflow has increased the lake volume and diminished the relative importance of wall rock leachate. The formation and reaction of secondary minerals around pit lakes in net evaporative environments are both a source and sink for metals. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

New Oxygen Isotope Diagrams of Late Pleistocene and Holocene Ice Wedges in Mamontova Gora and Syrdakh Lake, Central Yakutia	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												This paper reports on the oxygen isotope composition of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene syngenetic ice wedges, which were exposed at Mamontova Gora and Syrdakh Lake, the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry dating, and the reconstruction of the winter air temperatures during ice wedge formation. Organic microinclusions from the ice wedges were directly dated, which allowed us to establish seven dates ranging from 13 to 19 ka BP. The age of the ice wedges is shown to be younger than 20 ka, but older than 10 ka BP. In the area of Mamontova Gora, delta O-18 is in the range of -24.7 to -30.9 parts per thousand for the Late Pleistocene ice wedges, and of -23.2 to -25.9 parts per thousand for the Holocene ice wedges. In the area of Syrdakh Lake, delta O-18 ranges from -29.2 to -32.5 parts per thousand. At the Mamontova Gora site, the average winter air temperatures, which were reconstructed from the isotope data, ranged from -28 to -31 degrees C during most of the period when the Late Pleistocene ice wedges were formed; the January temperature was -42 degrees C, -46 degrees C. At the Syrdakh Lake site, the Late Pleistocene winter conditions were more severe: the average winter air temperature ranged from -30 to -32 degrees C, and the average January air temperature was -44, -48 degrees C. In the Holocene, the average winter air temperatures were higher and ranged from -24 to -28 degrees C, while the average January temperatures ranged from -36 to -42 degrees C.

Vibrio cholerae attached to crustacean zooplankton was quantified via FISH and epifluorescence microscopy. Concentrations obtained by CARD-FISH/SPC were significantly higher than those obtained by culture in 2011, but were mostly of similar magnitude in 2012. Maximum cell numbers were 1.26x10(6)V. cholerae per L in Neusiedler See and 7.59x10(7)V. cholerae per L in the shallow alkaline lakes. Only on a few occasions during summer was the crustacean zooplankton the preferred habitat for V. cholerae. In winter, V. cholerae was not culturable but could be quantified at all sites with CARD-FISH/SPC. Beside temperature, suspended solids, zooplankton and ammonium were the main predictors of V. cholerae abundance in Neusiedler See, while in the shallow alkaline lakes it was organic carbon, conductivity and phosphorus. Based on the obtained concentrations a first estimation of the health risk for visitors of the lake could be performed.					julia, baudart/A-5229-2011	Farnleitner, Andreas/0000-0002-0542-5425; Baudart, Julia/0000-0003-3372-7874; Kirschner, Alexander/0000-0002-9797-3073; Sommer, Regina/0000-0002-7781-1915													1462-2912	1462-2920				NOV	2015	17	11			SI		4366	4378		10.1111/1462-2920.12861	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12861								25847810					WOS:000366139500017

Swamps such as the Lorwai Swamp are important water sources, and information on the parasite species infecting Oreochromis nilotocus baringoensis in the hot springs of Lorwai Swamp which have a distinct genetic makeup from their counterparts in Lake Baringo is lacking. The purpose of this study was to provide a knowledge base on the parasite species infecting O. niloticus baringoensis in these springs, facilitate their comparison with those in Lake Baringo and determine their relationship with selected water quality parameters. Methods 347 fish were collected and standard parasitological procedures were used to examine the presence of parasites. Physico-chemical parameters were measured in situ and water samples were collected for chlorophyll-a determination and nutrient analyses in the laboratory using standard methods. Relationship between parasitic infections and selected water quality parameters was determined by PCA using SPSS version 22. Results Two parasite species were common in all sites: Cichlidogyrus sclerosus and Clinostomum sp. Some parasites correlated positively with some parameters; Amirthalingamia macracantha and Contracaecum sp. with nitrogen compounds. Others like Clinostomum sp. and Tylodelphys sp. correlated negatively with dissolved oxygen. Conclusion Results from this study showed that there were both positive and negative relationships between some water quality parameters and the prevalence of recovered parasites. O. niloticus baringoensis from Lake Baringo also recorded high parasite prevalence and this calls for sensitization of the public on the risks that may arise from the consumption of undercooked infected fish.					; Ongondo, Geoffrey/V-9869-2019	Otachi, Elick/0000-0001-9947-780X; Adamba, Stephanie Wangare Kamau/0000-0002-3622-7720													1230-2821	1896-1851				JUN	2020	65	2					441	451		10.2478/s11686-020-00178-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11686-020-00178-2		FEB 2020						32077035					WOS:000516272600002

Hydroclimatic contrasts over Asian monsoon areas and linkages to tropical Pacific SSTs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Knowledge of spatial and temporal hydroclimatic differences is critical in understanding climatic mechanisms. Here we show striking hydroclimatic contrasts between northern and southern parts of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (ETP), and those between East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) areas during the past similar to 2,000 years. During the Medieval Period, and the last 100 to 200 years, the southern ETP (S-ETP) area was generally dry (on average), while the northern ETP (N-ETP) area was wet. During the Little Ice Age (LIA), hydroclimate over S-ETP areas was wet, while that over N-ETP area was dry (on average). Such hydroclimatic contrasts can be broadly extended to ISM and EASM areas. We contend that changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the tropical Pacific Ocean could have played important roles in producing these hydroclimatic contrasts, by forcing the north-south movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and intensification/slowdown of Walker circulation. The results of sensitivity experiments also support such a proposition.

Temporal and between-site variation in helminth communities of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from NE Poland.: 1.: Regional fauna and component community levels	PARASITOLOGY												Helminth infections were Studied in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from 3 woodland sites in N.E. Poland in the late summers of 1999 and 2002, to assess the temporal stability of derived statistics describing the regional helminth fauna and Component community structure, and spatial influence on the latter. Regional helminth fauna changed dramatically between the two years, primarily due to a fall in the abundance of Syphacia petrusewiczi bolt Was partially compensated for by an increase in Mesocestoides lineatus and Cladotaenia globifera. It was dominated by nematodes overall, but More so in 1999 than in 2002 when larval cestodes were more frequent. Most derived parameters for component community structure varied considerably between sites and the two surveys, the hierarchical order for sites not being maintained between surveys. They,were susceptible to the disproportionate influence of three relatively rare, unpredictable species with the greatest overall aggregated distribution among hosts. Jaccard's similarity, index was less influenced by the rare species, showing greater stability between sites and across years. In conclusion, temporal variation confounded any site-specific characteristics of the summary measures quantified in this study and their usefulness is therefore restricted to the years in which the surveys were conducted.

Regionalization of Northeast US moisture conditions: analysis of synoptic-scale atmospheric drivers	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Previous investigations have documented relationships between global-scale forcings and Northeast United States moisture conditions, yet the physical pathways from global-scale forcing to sub-regional moisture deficit or surplus are not well understood. This research uses eigenvector-based regionalization to confirm the existence of sub-regional moisture environments within the Northeast. Synoptic classification is used to derive daily weather types that impact these moisture environments, and evaluate the relationship between global and synoptic scales. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) regionalization identifies 3 sub-regions across the Northeast with homogeneous moisture conditions including New England, the Eastern Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic Regions. All 3 regions' PDSI conditions are predominantly associated with variations in precipitation, rather than thermal characteristics. The frequency of key precipitation-associated synoptic types can inform PDSI variability in the regions, where drier conditions are observed during growing seasons with a reduced frequency of precipitation-inducing synoptic types and an enhanced frequency of dry synoptic types. Variations in the frequencies of these synoptic types are partially explained by the phase of the various teleconnection patterns. In the case of the New England region, 14 % of the variance in PDSI is explained by the frequency of synoptic type D2, and 12 % of the variance in D2 is explained by variations in the Summer Atmospheric Drought Index. The New England region became significantly wetter (positive PDSI) from 1950 to 2016. This study suggests a partial cause of this trend is the increased and decreased frequencies of wet and dry synoptic types, respectively, both related to the phase of the Summer Atmospheric Drought Index.

The study area was the coast of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. The data are from 13 sites and include for the water fraction of a melted ice sample pH, electric conductivity and soluble matter, and for the suspended matter within the ice include the total mass, organic proportion and concentrations of some chemical elements. Three lakes were sampled for regional freshwater references. The soluble matter was mainly due to the salts in sea water acid amounted to around 1 g/l (25-50% of the water salinity), and the pH was 4.0-7.5. The sediment content was mostly 1-10 mg/l; larger values resulted from industrial and traffic fallout on ice and snow and from sea bottom sand. Of toxic metals, lead and zinc showed enriched concentrations in ice and snow. The snow cover was also investigated and the result was close to those of the ice samples, but the pH and amount of soluble matter was lower in the snow. A potential ecological risk exists in spring as the ice and snow meltwater, with possibly a very low pH and enriched in pollutants, is mixed with the surface water layer. This layer is particularly thin beneath the fast ice zone.

Christian			A cryptic new species of tiger swallowtail (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) from eastern North America	ZOOKEYS												In the eastern Great Lakes region of North America, two tiger swallowtail species have previously been recognized, Papilio glaucus Linnaeus, 1758 and Papilio canadensis Rothschild & Jordan, 1906. A third entity, the Midsummer Tiger Swallowtail, has been treated as a P. glaucus x canadensis hybrid, and exhibits a mosaic of both intermediate and unique morphological and biological traits. Here we demonstrate that rather than being a localized, historically recent hybrid phenomenon, the Midsummer Tiger Swallowtail maintains its morphological and physiological distinctness over a large geographic region in the absence of one or both putative parental species, and was first documented in the literature nearly 150 years ago. Papilio solstitius sp. nov. is physiologically unique in delaying post-diapause development, which results in allochronic isolation between the spring flights of P. glaucus and P. canadensis, and the late summer flight of P. glaucus. Similarly, the geographic range of Papilio solstitius spans the region between the northern terminus of P. glaucus and southern limits of P. canadensis, remaining distinct in areas of sympatry. Defining the taxonomic identity of this unique evolutionary lineage provides an important baseline for further inquiry into what has served as an exemplary species group in evolutionary study.

Due to the lack of well-dated and high-resolution paleoclimate records, long-term monsoon dynamics are still not well understood in the western TP, which is currently influenced by both the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the westerlies. Here we present a multi-proxy lacustrine record covering the past 10,500 years from Aweng Co, an alpine lake at the northern limit of the modern ASM in western Tibet. Our results show that the western TP was mainly controlled by the ISM during the Holocene and the regional ecosystem/environment was sensitive to climate change. The climate was the wettest between 10.5 and 7.3 cal kyr BP, when terrestrial plants in the catchment were productive and the biomass of benthic algae was low possibly due to limited sunlight at the lake bottom due to high lake level. From 7.3 to 5.0 cal kyr BP the climate shifted towards drier conditions, resulting in a decline in terrestrial plant cover. Between 5.0 and 3.1 cal kyr BP, the climate became even drier, resulting in a further decline in vegetation cover in the catchment. Between 4.6 and 3.1 cal kyr BP, 100% endogenic dolomite precipitated from the lake water, possibly induced by high Mg/Ca ratios. After 3.1 cal kyr BP, the climate was the driest and frequent centennial-scale droughts occurred. The lake level was low and would have resulted in more light reaching the lake bottom, favoring the growth of benthic algae. The reconstructed lake level change of Aweng Co agrees well with the paleo-shoreline records in the southern TP, demonstrating that the ISM evolution played a key role in lake hydrological processes in this region. A comparison of paleoclimate records shows the ISM reached 34.5 degrees N in the western TP during the Holocene. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Négrel, P; Petelet-Giraud, E; Barbier, J; Gautier, E				Négrel, P; Petelet-Giraud, E; Barbier, J; Gautier, E			Surface water-groundwater interactions in an alluvial plain:: Chemical and isotopic systematics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Our work on the Loire River forms part of a French National Research Program dedicated to wetlands and aims to better understand the global functioning of the system from the hydrological, geochemical, ecological and sociological aspects. The present study, using a coupled hydrological and geochemical (stable and Sr isotopes) approach, focuses on the `Soulangy' site with its secondary anastomosing channels just below the confluence of the Loire and Allier rivers, and also on the `Dorna"nt' site with two unconnected oxbow lakes 50 km upstream of the confluence. The stable isotopes of water (delta(18)O, delta(2)H) show that the alluvial (or riverbank) aquifer feeds the Loire River during the summer, but is not recharged by the river during flood periods in the winter; the alluvial groundwater thus' has a purely local origin from precipitation. The major elements reveal an anthropogenic input of Cl and more importantly of NO3, especially near farms. The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopes identify different groundwater layers in the alluvium, i.e. an upper and a lower alluvial aquifer, and a perched aquifer at Dornant, that have relatively complex relationships with the surface water. The two main rivers (Loire and Allier) present distinct geochemical characteristics reflecting the different lithologies that they drain upstream. In addition, the secondary channels, lying parallel to the Loire main stream at the Soulangy site, give different geochemical signatures, which shows that they are not fed by the same overflows of the Loire, they are more-or-less well connected to the upper level of the alluvial plain, and a longitudinal study of one of these channels has revealed a Loire River influence progressively replaced by a water contribution from the upper alluvial aquifer: Similarly, the two oxbow lakes at the Dornant site are not. supplied by the same water during the summer months. A conceptual scheme of the Loire hydrosystem based on delta(18)O and 87Sr/86Sr suggests that the isotopic variations of the Loire River can be related to a Massif Central surface-water supply for the Loire and Allier main streams and to a groundwater supply from the alluvial plains.

J	Zohar, Y; Schiller, G				Zohar, Y; Schiller, G			Growth and water use by selected seed sources of Eucalyptus under high water table and saline conditions	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The objectives of the research were (a) to determine which of the several selected Israeli provenances (seed sources) of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. occidentalis is growing best under given ecological conditions and high ground water table and salinity; (b) to determine the water consumption, i.e., transpiration (T) of the provenance that is growing best in most of the sites and the influence of the water consumption on the ground water table. Five sites in the Yezre'el valley were selected as representing a wide range of environmental conditions and of secondary salinization. Of the eight provenances selected according to the earlier knowledge, the Hedera and Lake Albaqutya provenances had the highest growth rates at all sites. Under site conditions of low salinity and high ground water table, the 3-year old trees of the Hedera and Lake Albaqutya provenances achieved a mean annual growth rate of 3.7 m in height and 4.3 cm in diameter, respectively. Under higher salinity the mean annual growth rate of the same provenances was reduced to 2.3 m in height and 2.7 cm in diameter. At age of 2.5 years, the daily T of the E. camaldulensis plot of 130 trees per 0.1 ha was between 0.90 and 1.20 mm day(-1) in winter time; and between 3.90 and 4.50 mm day(-1) on summer days. At age of 3.5 years, T on summer days was between 4.80 and 5.10 mm day(-1). The cumulative water uptake by the Eucalyptus trees, i.e., total T from November 1994 to September 1996 was 1882 mm. During this period the effective rainfall amounted to 950 mm, which means that the plantation used 932 mm, in excess of the effective rainfall on the site, which resulted in the lowering of the ground water table by 1.20 m.

Mercury (Hg) is of particular interest as methylmercury (MeHg), a neurotoxin which bioaccumulates through foodwebs, can reach levels in fish and wildlife that may pose health risks to human consumers. We used spring-time sampling of the accumulated snowpack at sites located varying distances from the major developments to estimate winter 2012 Hg loadings to a similar to 20 000 km(2) area of the Athabasca oil sands region. Total Hg (THg; all forms of Hg in a sample) loads were predominantly particulate-bound (79 +/- 12%) and increased with proximity to major developments, reaching up to 1000 ng m(-2). MeHg loads increased in a similar fashion, reaching up to 19 ng m(-2) and suggesting that oil sands developments are a direct source of MeHg to local landscapes and water bodies. Deposition maps, created by interpolation of measured Hg loads using geostatistical software, demonstrated that deposition resembled a bullseye pattern on the landscape, with areas of maximum THg and MeHg loadings located primarily between the Muskeg and Steepbank rivers. Snowpack concentrations of THg and MeHg were significantly correlated (r = 0.45-0.88, p < 0.01) with numerous parameters, including total suspended solids (TSS), metals known to be emitted in high quantities from the upgraders (vanadium, nickel, and zinc), and crustal elements (aluminum, iron, and lanthanum), which were also elevated in this region. Our results suggest that at snowmelt, a complex mixture of chemicals enters aquatic ecosystems that could impact biological communities of the oil sands region.

The photosynthesis of the natural population was measured at eight temperatures in the range of 2-35A degrees C, at nine different irradiance levels in the range of 0-1,320 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR at each applied temperature. The photoadaptation parameter (I (k)) and the maximum photosynthetic rate (P (max)) correlated positively with the temperature between 2 and 30A degrees C, and there was a remarkable drop in both parameters at 35A degrees C. The low I (k) at low temperatures enabled the active photosynthesis of overwintering populations at low irradiance levels under ice and snow cover. The optimum of the photosynthesis was above 20A degrees C at irradiances above 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). At lower irradiance levels (7.5-30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), the photosynthesis was the most intensive in the temperature range of 2-5A degrees C. The interaction between light and temperature allowed the proliferation of A. flos-aquae in Lake Stechlin resulting in winter water bloom in this oligo-mesotrophic lake. The applied 2A degrees C is the lowest experimental temperature ever in the photosynthesis/growth studies of A. flos-aquae, and the results of the P-I and P-T measurements provide novel information about the tolerance and physiological plasticity of this species.

Late Quaternary slip rates for faults of the central Walker Lane (Nevada, USA): Spatiotemporal strain release in a strike-slip fault system	GEOSPHERE												The Walker Lane is a broad shear zone that accommodates a significant portion of North American-Pacific plate relative transform motion through a complex of fault systems and block rotations. Analysis of digital elevation models, constructed from both lidar data and structure-from-motion modeling of unmanned aerial vehicle photography, in conjunction with Be-10 and Cl-38 cosmogenic and optically stimulated luminescence dating define new Late Pleistocene to Holocene minimum strike-slip rates for the Benton Springs (1.5 +/- 0.2 mm/yr), Petrified Springs (0.7 +/- 0.1 mm/yr), Gumdrop Hills (0.9(+0.3)/(-0.2) mm/yr), and Indian Head (0.8 +/- 0.1 mm/yr) faults of the central Walker Lane (Nevada, USA). Regional mapping of the fault traces within Quaternary deposits further show that the Indian Head and southern Benton Springs faults have had multiple Holocene ruptures, with inferred coseismic displacements of similar to 3 m, while absence of displaced Holocene deposits along the Agai Pah, Gumdrop Hills, northern Benton Springs, and Petrified Springs faults suggest they have not. Combining these observations and comparing them with geodetic estimates of deformation across the central Walker Lane, indicates that at least one-third of the similar to 8 mm/yr geodetic deformation budget has been focused across strike-slip faults, accommodated by only two of the five faults discussed here, during the Holocene, and possibly half from all the strike-slip faults during the Late Pleistocene. These results indicate secular variations of slip distribution and irregular recurrence intervals amongst the system of strike-slip faults. This makes the geodetic assessment of fault slip rates and return times of earthquakes on closely spaced strike-slip fault systems challenging. Moreover, it highlights the importance of understanding temporal variations of slip distribution within fault systems when comparing geologic and geodetic rates. Finally, the study provides examples of the importance and value in using observations of soil development in assessing the veracity of surface exposure ages determined with terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide analysis.

Its population declined dramatically between 1940 and 1967. In a reintroduction program that was initiated in 1992, plants were transplanted into five microhabitats at a density of 10 plants/m(2). Seasonal monitoring identified an initial increase in plant size followed by high mortality in three of five sites. Data suggest that stem density is a good indicator of future transplant success and that current velocity is an important environmental factor associated with transplant success. However, herbivores have continually clipped reproductive culms just below the water surface. This limits transplants to clonal reproduction.																									1996	283						179	186																WOS:A1996BH04D00022

Here, we use the delta O-18 records from adult ostracode shells to reconstruct the EASM variations over the last 3 kyrs in southwestern Japan. A common variation with a 200 yr periodicity among the Asian monsoonal regions was recognized between BC 800 and BC 100. Since then, neither a correlation between the EASM variation and solar activity or a common EASM variation through EASM regions has been identified. The evidence reveals that solar activity dominantly affected the centennial-scale EASM variations throughout Asian monsoonal regions until BC 100. Furthermore, factors other than solar activity that varied and differed in specific regions controlled the EASM intensity due to decreasing summer solar insolation in the Northern Hemisphere after BC 100. These relations indicate that the dominant factor that affects the EASM variations shifts according to the solar insolation intensity.

J	Ashok, K; Soraisam, B; Tejavath, CT; Cubasch, U				Ashok, Karumuri; Soraisam, Bidyabati; Tejavath, Charan Teja; Cubasch, Ulrich			Summer monsoon over northeastern India during the last millennium	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Analysing three high resolution coupled model simulations for the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) regimes, available as the last millennium simulations of the PMIP3, we find that Northeastern Indian summer monsoon rainfall (NEISMR) did not change appreciably from the MCA to the LIA. This is in contrast to the signals in the rest of the Indian region. Our results from all the models suggest that, during the MCA, the simulated 100-hPa tropical easterly jet (TEJ) becomes relatively more intense than that during LIA, due to a stronger Tibetan High. This strengthening of the TEJ results in an associated increase in relative vorticity at the 500 hPa over the Head Bay of Bengal and neighbouring east coast of the Bay of Bengal. This results in higher moisture availability and increased summer monsoon rainfall in the neighbourhood, including the central Indian region, during the MCA. However, the simulations do not show any such changes over northeastern India, indicating a relatively stable simulated NEISMR from MCA through LIA. Furthermore, just as the current day observations, the simulated correlations between the NEISMR with various concurrent ENSO indices are weak and statistically insignificant during the MCA and LIA regimes. Interestingly, an analysis of time-slice simulations for the MCA and LIA from an atmospheric general circulation model broadly agree with the above conclusions, indicating that the tropical ocean and atmospheric coupling may not have played a major role in the northeast climate.

These salt-encrusted depressions are widely spread across the Earth, where they are characterized by high salt concentrations, intense UV radiation, high evaporation, and low precipitation. Their surfaces are completely dry in summer; intermittent flooding occurs in winter turning them into transitory hypersaline lakes. Thanks to new approaches such as culture-dependent, culture-independent, and metagenomic-based methods, it is important to study microbial life under polyextreme conditions and understand what lives in these dynamic ecosystems and how they function. Regarding these particular features, new halophilic microorganisms have been isolated from some salt flats and identified as excellent producers of primary and secondary metabolites and granules such as halocins, enzymes, carotenoids, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and exopolysaccharides. Additionally, halophilic microorganisms are implemented in heavy metal bioremediation and hypersaline wastewater treatment. As a result, there is a growing interest in the distribution of halophilic microorganisms around the world that can be looked upon as good models to develop sustainable biotechnological processes for all fields. This review provides insights into diversity, ecology, metabolism, and genomics of halophiles in hypersaline salt flats worldwide as well as their potential uses in biotechnology.

Developing a climate transfer function for this region is crucial for both biodiversity protection and enhancing our understanding of feedback mechanisms between low-latitude and high-altitude areas in the context of global climate change. We investigated the chrysophycean stomatocyst assemblages from surface sediments of 46 high mountain lakes (altitude: 3244 to 5043 m) in the TPRYPA to assess the suitability of cysts in prediction of climate variability in high mountains. A total of 194 morphotypes were identified. Gradient forest (GF) model identified that altitude is the key environmental gradient with relation to cyst assemblages and cyst assemblages changed the composition substantially at altitude of 3200 and 4400 m, respectively. Cyst-based inference model for altitude using weighted-averaging method resulted in cross-validated jack-knifed-R2 of 0.60. The cyst-altitude transfer functions suggest that chrysophycean stomatocysts have a great potential as a powerful tool for climate reconstructions in alpine regions of the Hengduan Mountains.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2024	167								112729	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112729		OCT 2024											WOS:001336640900001

A total of 198 phytoplankton species were identified belonging to 6 classes, 13 orders, 24 families, and 53 genera. The community structure was dominated by diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. In April, 163 species of phytoplankton from four phyla were identified, with abundance ranging from 2.94 x 10(5) to 2.32 x 10(6) cells/m(3) and an average of 1.28 x 10(6) cells/m(3). In September, the abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 1.52 x 10(5) to 1.58 x 10(6) cells/m(3), with an average value of 6.76 x 10(5) cells/m(3). Sixteen species were classified as dominant (Y > 0.02), among which four showed dominance in both sampling periods, with their dominance level and niche width differing with the season. Water temperature increased with decreasing altitude. At <3500 m in September, Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Oocystis borgei became dominant. Cymbella cistula, Amphora ovalis, and Navicula cryptocephala occupy broad ecological niches and can represent indicator species for water quality. Water temperature, pH, and salinity were identified as primary factors influencing the ecological niche differentiation of dominant phytoplankton species. The interspecific niche overlap was higher in September than in April and greater at >4500 m compared to other elevation ranges (>4500 m; 4000-4500 m; 3500-<4000 m; <3500 m). The effect of elevation on the community structure was greater than that of season. This is the first study to characterize the association of ecological niches of phytoplankton in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River with physicochemical environmental parameters. This provides baseline information for the conservation of biodiversity and management of aquatic ecosystems in the rivers of the Tibetan Plateau.

Atmospheric flows of semi-volatile organic pollutants to the Great Lakes estimated by the United States' Integrated Atmospheric Deposition and Canada's Great Lakes Basin Monitoring and Surveillance Networks	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We calculated the wet and dry deposition, vapor absorption, and volatilization flows (in kg/yr) of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nine organochlorine pesticides, and two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into and out of the Great Lakes during 2010-2015 (inclusive). Particle, vapor, and precipitation concentrations from five rural and remote stations (one site on each lake) and two urban sites, operated by the United States and Canada, were used for the flow calculations. Output from the water to the air was the most important process for PCBs, chlordanes, and p,P-DDE. The flows of endosulfan, p,p'-DDT, and phenanthrene were dominated by vapor absorption from the air to the water. The flow of benzo[ajpyrene was controlled by wet and dry deposition to the water. The flows of the hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) into and out of the lakes were about equal, indicating air-water equilibrium for these compounds. Among the lakes, Lakes Superior and Erie had the highest input and output flows. The input and output flows for the five lakes were decreasing with halving times of 1-10 years and 10-40 years, respectively. Most chemicals had seasonal variations in their flows, with maximum inputs in the summer and maximum outputs in the fall. The flows of PCBs and PAHs into Lakes Michigan and Erie were associated with Chicago and Cleveland, respectively. Combining our data with previous data over the period 1992-2015, we estimated that the input flows of most of these chemicals have significantly decreased, but the output flows do not show consistent trends.

Lake 114 was at pH 5.9 before the alum addition. The alum produced measured extremes of pH 4.5 and [Al] of 2,237 .mu.g/L near the point of addition. This study examined the effects of the alum addition on ionic concentrations of blood and tissue (gills, adductor muscle, foot and visceral mass) of the floater mussel, Anodonta grandis grandis. Mussels were collected from a second lake, 377, and introduced into Lake 114 at five locations five days before the alum addition. In response to transfer from the oligotrophic, unmanipulated Lake 377 to acidified Lake 114 (pH 5.9), blood of mussels showed a marked elevation of [Ca++], decline in [Mg++] and a temporary increase in [Cl-] but no change in [Na+], [K+] or [SO4=]. During the alum addition, in mussels near the point source of the alum addition, blood [Na+] and C[Cl-] declined and [Ca++] became still more elevated. Mussels suffered no mortality associated with the alum addition and almost no mortality during 26 days in Lake 114. Gill increased in [Al], [Ca], [Mn], declined in [Na] and showed no change in [Cd] in mussels near the alum addition. Visceral mass and adductor muscle also had lower [Na] in mussels near the point of alum addition. We attribute the increase in blood [Ca++] to the dissolution of the Ca stores in the shell and/or mantle of the mussels. This would provide protection to the mussels during short-term declines in pH such as spring or summer episodic events. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to small decreases in pH by mussles, already near the limits for obtaining sufficient Ca++, might be intolerable. It follows that acidification to the pH of 5.9 of soft water lakes containing mussels would be expected to lead to the loss of A. g. grandis from these waters.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	1988	17	4					479	491		10.1007/BF01055513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01055513													WOS:A1988N367900008

However, there is considerable uncertainty in the phosphorus load-bloom relationship, because of other biophysical factors that influence bloom size, and because the observed bloom size is not necessarily the true bloom size, owing to measurement error. In this study, we address these uncertainties by relating late-summer bloom observations to spring phosphorus load within a Bayesian modeling framework. This flexible framework allows us to evaluate three different forms of the load-bloom relationship, each with a particular combination of statistical error distribution and response transformation. We find that a novel implementation of a gamma error distribution, along with an untransformed response, results in a model with relatively high predictive skill and realistic uncertainty characterization, when compared to models based on more common statistical formulations. Our results also underscore the benefits of a hierarchical approach that enables assimilation of multiple sets of bloom observations within the calibration processes, allowing for more thorough uncertainty quantification and explicit differentiation between measurement and model error. Finally, in addition to phosphorus loading, the model includes a temporal trend component indicating that Lake Erie has become increasingly susceptible to large cyanobacteria blooms over the study period (2002-2013). Results suggest that current phosphorus loading targets will be insufficient for reducing the intensity of cyanobacteria blooms to desired levels, so long as the lake remains in a heightened state of bloom susceptibility.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Scavia, Donald/0000-0002-2784-8269; Obenour, Daniel/0000-0002-7459-218X; Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2014	50	10					7847	7860		10.1002/2014WR015616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR015616													WOS:000344783800018

We hypothesized that annual water-level fluctuations limit growth and survival of the emergent macrophyte Zizania latifolia. We investigated adaptations to submergence and sought to define the tolerances of Z. latifolia to the amplitude and timing of water-level fluctuations in these types of lake, at different stages in its phenology and life cycle. Shoots from rhizome buds emerged in early spring and reached maximum extension with high water levels in summer. Z. latifolia did not occur in lakes with the highest amplitude (> 5 m) of fluctuation. Height growth in lakes with low amplitude (reservoir-like) was smaller than in lakes with greater amplitude (intermittent to quasi-natural fluctuations), giving the appearance of 'short' and 'tall' phenotypes. Across all lakes, however, maximum height was linearly related to water depth in June and to annual amplitude of water level, indicating a continuous phenotypic response. Peak biomass was weakly affected by these environmental drivers. Field experiments showed that seedlings tolerated water depths of c. twice their height (0.6 m), and submergence rates similar to their maximum extension growth rate (2 cm.d(-1)).

The Santiaguillo Lake in Durango, a crucial haven for waterfowl, faces pollution issues. Despite its importance, no studies have been conducted on the presence of contaminants in the lake's birds. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of inorganic elements in the liver tissue of green-winged teals (Anas crecca) and snow geese (Anser caerulescens), as well as to determine if they pose a risk to their health. For this purpose, samples of liver tissue were collected from 27 snow geese and 30 green-winged teals. Metal determination was carried out using the voltammetry technique. The results revealed that concentrations in green-winged teals, from highest to lowest, were Al > Ni > As > Cr > Hg > Cu > Zn > Sn > Pb > Cd; whereas in snow geese, they were Al > Ni > As > Zn > Pb > Cr > Hg > Cu > Sn > Cd. Generally, hepatic concentrations of Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Al, and Hg fall within non-lethal ranges; however, exposure levels to Cr, Sn, As, and Ni were observed.

Limited Utility of Early Life-History Indices for Predicting Yellow Perch Year-Class Strength in Eastern South Dakota Glacial Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We used a long-term data set (2000-2016) of larval, age-0 (juvenile), and age-2 Yellow Perch Perca flavescens catches from nine glacial lakes in eastern South Dakota to track multiple cohorts through time to determine whether year-class strength (measured as gill-net CPUE of age-2 fish) could be indexed at the larval or juvenile stage. We observed a strong relationship between larval and juvenile abundance (r = 0.78), but neither were related to abundance of the same cohort at age 2. Furthermore, categorical analyses suggested that some of the strongest age-2 year-classes corresponded with the lowest larval and juvenile catches and vice versa. Our assessment suggests that Yellow Perch year-class strength in eastern South Dakota glacial lakes may not be fixed until some point after the juvenile (i.e., fall age 0) stage and correspondingly that values for larval and juvenile CPUE are of limited utility as early indices of year-class strength for Yellow Perch. Before using abundance estimates at early life stages as measures of recruitment, researchers and managers should confirm that these estimates provide a meaningful index of abundance at adulthood or the point of recruitment to the fishery.

Greater awareness of its global importance is urgently needed to ensure waterbird populations remain in favourable conservation status, as well as the enhancement of wider wetland biodiversity within this region. The designation of protected wetland areas and building a green ecological corridor in the Yangtze floodplain is now becoming a critical issue of interest to the Chinese government. Priority sites in this area were identified based on the criteria used to identify sites that qualify as Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites) and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) by using multi-source data. The results show that 140 of the sites surveyed are priority sites. The Importance Index (/) for the whole floodplain decreased slightly from 2001-2005 and an unbalanced distribution pattern is evident with Jiangxi and Hunan provinces significantly higher than the other provinces in the floodplain. Although more than 60% of the priority sites are currently located outside protected areas, the average Conservation Effectiveness Index (C) of the whole floodplain is 75.6%, which suggests the coverage of protected areas for most wintering waterbird population is reasonable. Conservation of the Yangtze River floodplain needs to be further strengthened due to declining waterbird abundances and the mismatch between the distribution of protected areas and their importance for wintering waterbirds. A comprehensive system for priority site identification and protection and scientific review is needed. Multi-sourced data from regular, systematic and coordinated monitoring of waterbird distribution and abundance across the EAAF, as well as national scale citizen science programmes are also critically important.

Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia, with a surface area of 3200 km(2) and a watershed of 15,100 km(2) located at 1800 ma.s.l. Most of the wetlands situated along the rivers and Lake Tana shore support several thousands of birds. Taking previous work in the area into consideration, the Lake Tana sub-basin possesses six globally threatened species, 35 highland biome species and four Sudan-Guinea Savanna biome species. The sub-basin area is particularly important for wetland and water birds. The total population of birds counted during the winter season exceeds 150,000 seasonally, in Lake Tana area alone. Shesher-wallala area contributes the largest winter population. The Lake Tana sub-basin consists of 78 families of 437 birds; the most dominant is Accipitridae with 39 species. The distribution of birds in the area is changeable. However, the Lake Tana area and associated wetlands hold the largest bird populations compared with forest, farmland and bush land habitats. The Fogera and Dembia flood plain provides suitable feeding and roosting sites for winter birds, and is also known as a congregation site. Both Palearctic (112) and Afrotropical migrants (7) occur. In addition, the Lake Tana sub-basin holds 15 species of endemic birds, some of which are shared with Eritrea. Degradation of the wetlands is underway, with overgrazing, vegetation removal, cultivation, deforestation, occurrence of invasive weeds, wetland drainage, flooding, continuing sedimentation, major water resources development in the basin are the main threats.

A Century of Forest Regrowth and Snow Loss Alters the Cooling Effect of Historical Land Use in the Upper Midwest	ECOSYSTEMS												Anthropogenic land use affects climate by altering the energy balance of the Earth's surface. In temperate regions, cooling from increased albedo is a common result of historical land-use change. However, this albedo cooling effect is dependent mainly on the exposure of snow cover following forest canopy removal and may change over time due to simultaneous changes in both land cover and snow cover. In this paper, we combine modern remote sensing data and historical records, incorporating over 100 years of realized land use and climatic change into an empirical assessment of centennial-scale surface forcings in the Upper Midwestern USA. We show that, although increases in surface albedo cooled through strong negative shortwave forcings, those forcings were reduced over time by a combination of forest regrowth and snow-cover loss. Deforestation cooled strongly (- 5.3 Wm(-2)) and mainly in winter, while composition shift cooled less strongly (- 3.03 Wm(-2)) and mainly in summer. Combined, changes in albedo due to deforestation, shifts in species composition, and the return of historical forest cover resulted in - 2.81 Wm(-2) of regional radiative cooling, 55% less than full deforestation. Forcings due to changing vegetation were further reduced by 0.32 Wm(-2) of warming from a shortened snow-covered season and a thinning of seasonal snowpack. Our findings suggest that accounting for long-term changes in land cover and snow cover reduces the estimated cooling impact of deforestation, with implications for long-term land-use planning.

The prevalence of ingested lead shot was significantly higher at Catahoula Lake (27%) than at the Mississippi River Delta (4%). Canvasbacks collected at Catahoula Lake showed significant differences in prevalence of ingested lead shot by age and mouth. We attributed age-related and seasonal variations to differences in foraging effort and exposure time. Body mass of canvasbacks at Catahoula Lake, after accounting for age, monthly variation, and body size, was significantly reduced (120 g or 10%) in birds that had lead shot in their gizzards.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	1990	54	2					211	215		10.2307/3809031	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809031													WOS:A1990DA45500003

Studies carried out in Lake Baikal in late spring (late May-early June) 1991 showed marked differences in the species composition and abundance of phytoplankton in different regions of the lake. The south and north basins were characterized by small forms of algae. The middle basin, Maloe More and the shallow waters of the Selenga had species with large cells including Aulacoseira islandica subsp. helvetica, Dinobryon cylindricum and D. divergens. 2. Areas of high biomass were correlated with shallow waters and river inputs. This was especially apparent in the region of the Selenga delta. The vertical distribution of phytoplankton indicated the non-synchronous start of the spring homothermy throughout the lake. Phytoplankton were concentrated in the upper 100 m layer with subsurface maxima resulting from the sinking of large algae. 3. The concentration of phytoplankton biomass in general at this time characterized the lake as moderately productive.

The present work documents the occurrence of invasive Palaemon macrodactylus in Iranian waters of the southern Caspian Sea. The morphological criteria of the specimens found undoubtedly agree with those of the species Palaemon macrodactylus Rathbun, 1902. During spring -summer 2015, the first specimens of P. macrodactylus were observed in the Gorgan Bay, southeastern Caspian Sea (2.9% of total abundance of palaemonid species). They were named an unknown species at that time. In the second survey in 2019-2020, P. macrodactylus has shown a slight increase in abundance (4.77%) in the bay, indicating the population of this species is evidently expanding in the area and successfully established in the southeastern Caspian Sea. Given its ability to be a successful invader in the new area of introduction, it could have adverse consequences for local biota, especially local shrimps (P. elegans and P. adspersus). Considering the possible invasion of this shrimp, biological and ecological aspects of the established P. macrodactylus in the southern Caspian Sea should be investigated to evaluate any consequences to local communities and/or species.

A high-resolution 1200-year lacustrine record of glacier and climate fluctuations in Lofoten, northern Norway	HOLOCENE												Here we present the first high-resolution late-Holocene glacier record from the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. The study is based on analyses of lacustrine sediments from the distal glacier-fed lake Kveitvikvatnet (30.1 m a.s.l.), as well as glacial-geomorphological mapping of the similar to 4.2-km(2) surrounding catchment. The lake sediment cores have been examined for input of glacial-derived sediments by using physical, geochemical and magnetic sediment properties, including x-ray fluorescence (XRF), magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size analyses, dry bulk density (DBD) and loss-on-ignition (LOI). Former glacier extent has been reconstructed using aerial photography and glacial-geomorphological mapping. Lichenometric dating has been used to construct a moraine chronology covering the recent fluctuations of the largest glacier (back to AD similar to 1740). AMS radiocarbon dating reveals that the lake sediment record covers the last 1200years, thereby including both the Little Ice Age' (LIA) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA). By linking continuously deposited lake sediment proxies of glacier fluctuation to known glacier frontal positions and an independent temperature reconstruction, former fluctuations in the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) and winter precipitation have been reconstructed. Reconstructed winter precipitation estimates have also been correlated to instrumental data from the region back to AD 1895 and show a remarkable correlation, which further strengthens our approach. We found that both MCA and LIA were periods of substantial glacier variations with respect to the present, with a maximum lowering of the ELA of similar to 75 and similar to 85m, respectively. Increased precipitation during these intervals, associated with more frequent and/or intense winter storms, is suggested to be the major driving force of glacier fluctuations in Lofoten.

The smaller size fractions (.ltoreq. 12 .mu.m) were dominant (.gtoreq. 50%) in sestonic particulate organic carbon (POC) and primary production during summer stratification, whereas larger particles (.gtoreq. 30 .mu.m) were abundant (.gtoreq. 50%) during winter turnover. Settling POC consisted mainly of large particles throughout the season. This pattern demonstrates the existence of biological particle transformation through zooplankton grazing (fecal pellet production), possibly supported by other biological and/or physico-chemical processes. Specific net increase reates of POC did not show much seasonal variation while scattering around zero. This is indicative for significant specific loss rates immediately compensating high production rates. POC sedimentation rates amounted to 12-39% of total loss in the large size classes (.gtoreq. 30 .mu.m), and .apprx. 20% of the primary production (193 g C ass.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.y-1) settle out of the epilimnion. Particulate C loss through washout did not significantly affect epilmnetic C turnover (.gtoreq. 6% of total loss in all size classes). Respiration was the dominant loss rate (68-79% of total loss in the size classes .ltoreq. 12 .mu.m). Grazing usually was not of great importance, except for the period in May/June when Daphnia grazed on abundant nannoplankton ("clear water phase"). Excretional was less than 7% of total loss in all size classes and did not contribute much to C turnover. In summary, epilimnetic C regeneration (including respiration, grazing, and excretion) amounted to .apprx. 80% of the primary production, which is in the same range of P regeneration.																			0003-9136					JUN	1990	118	4					403	419																WOS:A1990DN92500002

Persistent contaminants of emerging concern in a great lakes urban-dominant watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Within the Great Lakes, contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have been detected in urban surface waters. Understanding the human and ecological health consequences of environmentally-relevant exposures to persistent CECs, particularly as complex mixtures, is essential. Surface water and a limited number of sediment samples were collected over two years (Spring and Fall 2018-2019) at multiple locations in the Lake Huron to Lake Erie corridor to investigate more than 150 CECs. Surface water was analyzed for pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Sediment was analyzed for PFAS. Fifty compounds were detected at ng/L or ng/kg levels. Synthetic sweeteners accounted for 55.7% of the cumulative concentration of all compounds detected across sampling events, followed by pesticides (27.5%), pharmaceuticals (11.7%), and stimulants (3.5%), with 14 compounds consistently detected: acesulfame-potassium, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, lidocaine, atenolol, gemfibrozil, iohexol, atrazine, diaminochlorotriazine, deethyl-atrazine, deisopropylatrazine, 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and caffeine. Compound mixtures became increasingly complex downstream and indicated that the downstream Lake Huron to Erie corridor is wastewater effluentdominated, whereas the aquatic environment associated with Lake St. Clair is influenced by a mixed urban, suburban, and agricultural landscape. These results will inform follow-up studies on persistent contaminant mixtures and multiple stressors, and offer science-based priorities and evaluation objectives for natural resource and public health agencies/initiatives.

Based on data for C-14-primary production and biomass changes in a small and shallow lake (Creteil Lake, France), overall phytoplankton losses were calculated through an annual cycle (November 1985-October 1986). The summer period in 1986 is compared with two other summer periods in 1985 and 1980, these two years corresponding to extreme levels of algal biomass. 2. Independent from the trophic state of the lake, phytoplankton populations were dominated by small-sized species (< 20-mu-m); their high growth rate (maximal in May and June: 0.8 day-1) was characteristic of nanoplanktonic natural populations. 3. The positive correlation between phytoplankton losses and production indicates a close coupling between growth and loss processes. 4. With a high filtering rate (0.22 day-1 as an annual average), zooplankton impact is considerable at any time of the year but especially in late summer, when grazing losses exceeded primary production. 5. Despite the uncertainty concerning the meaning of C-14-primary production, the persistence of small algae throughout the year implies that a great part of the phytoplankton production was harvested by grazers which led to a recycling of organic matter within the water column.

During autumn migration, Bonaparte''s Gulls use three flyways: the Pacific, Mississippi and Atlantic, with the majority (60%) following the Mississippi Flyway from the Great lanes to the Gulf of Mexico and the remainder of the population split between the two coasts (Atlantic: 21%, Pacific 19%). Arrival and departure dates at various major stop-over areas were used to map details of the probable migration routes, particularly in eastern North America. The Atlantic Flyway was utilized for varying stretches by birds arriving from the breeding grounds mainly via the following routes: a) Saguenay River- Upper Saint John River- St. Croix River- Quoddy region, southwestern Bay of Fundy, b) Lower Great Lakes- Mohawk River- Hudson River- Long Island, New York area, and c) Lower Great Lakes- Delaware River-Delaware Bay/Chesapeake Bay.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1989	103	4					524	530																WOS:A1989EC79300006

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department conducts regular fishery-independent sampling of biotic communities using traditional sampling gears, such as gill nets and bag seines, in all of the major estuaries of adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. Previous studies have shown that eDNA approaches can complement traditional sampling methods.Methods: We compared fish community structure data in the Cedar Lakes estuary system obtained with traditional sampling gears with data obtained using eDNA sampling using a small sequence of mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene and a validated taxonomic reference file.Result: For spring and fall of 2022, eDNA metabarcoding detected a larger number of species than either bag seines or gill nets. Species richness detected via eDNA in two seasons in a single year was comparable with the species richness of agency's historical record based on traditional gears for Cedar Lakes.Conclusion: Seasonal and spatial variation in species richness was similar between traditional and eDNA sampling; however, eDNA metabarcoding allowed detection of several species that would be difficult or impossible to capture with either bag seines or gill nets. We observed two limitations of eDNA metabarcoding. Read depth was not a good index of relative abundance, which limits our ability to infer relative biomass using single samples. Secondly, we observed detection bias in our eDNA results. Specifically, eDNA failed to detect two species of elasmobranchs present when water sampling was performed and eDNA also performed poorly compared to traditional sampling gears for some species of bony fishes. Despite these limitations, eDNA metabarcoding proved to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative and compliment to traditional fisheries sampling gears for fishery-independent monitoring of community structure and composition in estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico.

J	Gökgöz, A; Tarcan, G				Gökgöz, A; Tarcan, G			Mineral equilibria and geothermometry of the Dalaman-Koycegiz thermal springs, southern Turkey	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The Dalaman and Koycegiz thermal springs are from karstic limestones belonging to Upper Cretaceous to Burdigalian Beydaglan autochthon and Carboniferous to Lutetian Lycian nappes. They have measured temperatures of 24- 41 degrees C, specific electrical conductivities of 14,310-45,600 mu S/cm, and are dominated by Na (1550-8500 mg/kg) and Cl (2725-15,320 mg/kg). The heat source of the geothermal systems of the area is tectonic related and the occurrence of the thermal springs is related to the young normal faults. Meteoric waters and seawaters recharge the reservoir rocks, are heated at depth with increasing geothermal gradient, and move up to the surface through the fractures and faults by convection trend and emerge as thermal springs. While thermal waters move up to the surface, they mix with different proportions of seawater and cold fresh waters. The seawater contribution to the thermal waters varies from 24% to 78%. Lake waters in the area are connected with thermal waters. Consequently, their chemical composition is influenced by the chemistry of thermal waters. Chemical equilibrium modelling based on measured outlet temperatures and measured pH shows that all the waters are oversaturated with respect to quartz and K-mica and undersaturated with respect to AI(OH)(3), anorthite, gypsum, siderite and SiO2(a). Albite, alunite, aragonite, Ca-montmorillonite, calcite, chalcedony, chlorite, dolomite, Fe(OH)(3)(a), fluorite, gypsum, illite, K-feldspar, kaolinite and sepiolite minerals are mostly oversaturated or undersaturated. Mineral saturation studies of the thermal springs indicate that dolomite, chalcedony and quartz are most likely to cause scaling at outlet conditions. Assessments from various chemical geothermometers, and Na-K-Mg ternary and mineral equilibrium diagrams suggest that the reservoir temperature is around 65-90 degrees C. The temperatures obtained from quartz, quartz-steam loss, Mg/Li geothermometers and mineral equilibrium diagrams give the most reasonable results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Clair, TA; Dennis, IF; Scruton, DA; Gilliss, M				Clair, Thomas A.; Dennis, Ian F.; Scruton, David A.; Gilliss, Mallory			Freshwater acidification research in Atlantic Canada: a review of results and predictions for the future	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Atlantic Canada receives the lowest acid deposition amounts in eastern North America, but has some of the most acidic surface waters on the continent, due to the low buffering provided by regional bedrock and wetlands that produce natural organic acids. Southwestern and eastern parts of Nova Scotia combine poor buffering, high organic acidity, and higher acid deposition, to produce extremely low surface water pH and acid neutralization capacity (ANC) values. Although sulfate deposition is decreasing, concurrent reductions in dissolved base cations, as well as the acid-base characteristics of natural organic acids, are not allowing the recovery of ANC or surface water pH. Spring-time acid pulses occur in Atlantic Canada, though these have been reduced in severity with decreases in winter acid deposition, while autumnal low pH pulses caused by organic acids are a regular occurence in Nova Scotia and must be separated from mineral acidity pulses. Geochemical modeling using both critical load and dynamic approaches, nevertheless predict improvements in the water chemistry of Nova Scotia lakes within the next 20 years. However, re-establishment of pre-acidification water chemistry in most of its lakes will require greater reductions in S emissions than are currently planned in Canada and the United States.																			1181-8700						2007	15						153	167		10.1139/A07-004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/A07-004													WOS:000253048300007

Forecasting lake-/sea-effect snowstorms, advancement, and challenges	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Forecasting lake-/sea-effect snowstorms, advancement,and challenges Abstract Lake-/sea-effect snow forms typically from late fall to winter when a cold air mass moves over the warmer, large water surface. The resulting intense snowfall has many societal impacts on communities living in downwind areas; hence, accurate forecasts of lake-/sea-effect snow are essential for safety and preparedness. Forecasting lake-/sea-effect snow is extremely challenging, but over the past decades the advancement of numerical forecast models and the expansion of observational networks have incrementally improved the forecasting capability. The recent advancement includes numerical forecast models with high spatiotemporal resolutions that allow simulating vigorous snowstorms at the kilometer-scale and the frequent inclusion of radar observations in the model. This combination of more accurate weather prediction models as well as ground-based and remotely sensed observations has aided operational forecasters to make better lake-/sea-effect snow forecasts. A remaining challenge is that many observations of precipitation, surface meteorology, evaporation,and heat supply from the water surface are still limited to being land-based and the information over the water, particularly offshore, remains a gap. This primer overviews the basic mechanisms for lake-/sea-effect snow formation, evolution of forecast techniques, and challenges to be addressed in the future.

However, the impact of spectral indices on land surface temperature (LST) with various urban forms, climates, and functions has not been sufficiently examined. Currently, the prevalent method for analyzing complex urban areas is the classification of local climate zones (LCZs). In this study, we aim to explore the urban thermal environment by utilizing GIS-based spatial analyses and statistical methods. We also examine LCZs and the temporal-spatial changes of LSTs in Sapanca Lake and its surroundings. A comparative analysis was conducted on the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) spectral indices in different LCZs and LST using a linear regression model. The results showed that all LCZs experienced a warming effect with an increase in NDBI, while they exhibited a cooling effect with the influence of NDVI and MNDWI. Notably, NDVI demonstrated a strong cooling effect in LCZ A (Dense trees) during the summer season, with an R2 coefficient of 0.73. Similarly, MNDWI had an R2 coefficient of 0.73 in LCZ A during spring. Values calculated as a result of regression are found as MAE:0.72 and MSE:0.75. These findings indicate the cooling effect of urban areas characterized by dense trees and water surfaces, highlighting their role in reducing LST. As a result, the research revealed the role of urban green systems and water surfaces in reducing the heat island effect, which is a problem, especially in urban centers. Overall, the study's results contribute to a better understanding of the thermal environmental characteristics in complex urban settings.

Annual precipitation (centimetres) and H+ and SO42- inputs declined during the decade. Precipitation SO42- concentration decreased, with two thirds of the decline occurring in winter. Winter precipitation and H+, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- inputs declined during the decade. Reduced precipitation SO42- concentration accounted for a third of the reduction in winter SO42- input. Up to snowpack peak water equivalent, snowmelt totalled one third and ion loss totalled 37-58% of cumulative precipitation inputs. Midwinter snowmelt was attributed to unfrozen soils and intermittent thaws. About 90% of snowmelt entered unfrozen soil, where soil processes significantly altered its chemistry. The watershed retained >99% of snowmelt H+, >95% of NH4+, and >80% of NO3-. At peak snowmelt, stream-water acid neutralization capacity declined by 360 mu equiv. L(-1), with >90% resulting from dilution. Stream-water NO3- concentration declined >85% during snowmelt and SO42- concentration changed <10%. Soil SO42- desorption was probably the major process buffering change in stream-water SO42- concentration.																			0706-652X					DEC	1996	53	12					2659	2672																WOS:A1996WL12500001

In this work, stable water isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) are used to appraise hydrologically significant transitions during annual landscape thaw at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (Utqiavik, Alaska). These hydrologically significant periods are then linked to annual shifts in the landscape energy balance, deduced from meteorological data and described by the microclimatic periods: Winter, Pre-Melt, Melt, Post-Melt, Summer, and Freeze-Up. The tight coupling of the microclimatic periods with the hydrological transitions supports the use of microclimatic periods as a means of linking polygonal surface water hydrology to meteorological datasets, which provides a mechanism for improving the representation of polygonal surface water hydrology in process-based models. Rayleigh process reconstruction of the isotopic changes revealed that 19% of winter precipitation was lost to sublimation prior to melting and that 23% of surface water was lost to evaporation during the first 10 days post-melt. This agrees with evaporation rates reported in a separate study using an eddy covariance flux tower located nearby. An additional 17% was lost to evaporation during the next 33 days. Stable water isotopes are also used to identify the dominant sources of surface water to various hydrogeomorphological features prevalent in polygonal terrain (a lake, a low centre polygon centre, troughs within the rims of low centre polygons, flat centre polygon troughs, a high centre polygon trough, and drainages). Hydrogeomorphologies that retained significant old water or acted as snow drifts are isotopically distinct during the Melt Period and therefore are easily distinguished. Biogeochemical changes related to the annual thaw are also reported and coupled to the hydrological transitions, which provides insight into the sources and sinks of these ions to and from the landscape.					; Heikoop, Jeffrey/C-1163-2011	Conroy, Nathan/0000-0003-0597-3373; Heikoop, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7648-3385													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 30	2020	34	3					749	764		10.1002/hyp.13623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13623		NOV 2019											WOS:000495415100001
J	Wang, P; Benoit, G				Wang, Peng; Benoit, Gaboury			Modeling the biogeochemical role of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in phosphorus cycling in a managed eutrophic lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Vertical distributions of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), sulfide, chlorophyll, and primary production produced by photosynthetic sulfur bacteria (PSB) were studied in a small stratified, highly productive, and dimictic lake, Linsley Pond, CT, USA. The goal was to understand and model the role of PSB in a lake undergoing trophic transformation as a result of lake management involving reduced phosphorus loading. High levels of sulfide developed in the anoxic hypolimnion, though a decrease was observed compared to earlier years, possibly as a result of lake management under a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) process. A deep chlorophyll maximum was observed, and absorption spectra confirmed that it was the result of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. The summer chlorophyll maximum occurred at an interface marked by high amounts of sulfide and low, but adequate, levels of light. Primary production by PSB was found at a depth of 7 m in July 2008, and thereafter extended slowly to 9 m until late fall overturn. PSB only contributed a minor portion of total primary production in Linsley Pond that year, but a straightforward biogeochemical phosphorus model reveals that the existence of PSB serves as a significant biological barrier for phosphorus being transported back into the upper mixing zone. A large amount of TDP was trapped in the hypolimnion, and upward transport of TDP from the upper boundary of the hypolimnion to the mixing zone was about 30% of external phosphorus loading from the only tributary during the summer stratification period. By comparison, the amount of TDP assimilated by PSB and settling back to the hypolimnion was comparable to external phosphorus loading to the lake from its tributary. As lake management reduces external P loading and productivity, bottom sulfide is likely to decrease, suppressing PSB activity and having the undesired effect of allowing more TDP to be transported upward to the epilimnion as this biological barrier is suppressed.

J	Ethier, DM				Ethier, Danielle M.			Population Trends of Monarch Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) Migrating From the Core of Canada's Eastern Breeding Population	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) (Linnaeus 1758) is being considered for up-listing to Endangered under the Canadian federal Species-at-Risk Act due to population declines recorded throughout the annual life cycle. Understanding local population dynamics is therefore necessary to assess the effect of environmental and human induced stressors, and to establish a benchmark from which management success can be measured through time. Using fall count data collected along the Lake Erie shoreline, which captures migrants moving south from the core eastern breeding population in Canada, monarch abundance trends are quantified. Count data from three migration count sites and one roost site were analyzed following similar methods as to make findings comparable. Two of these datasets are newly compiled and are analyzed here for the first time. Results suggest that during the past 10 yr, the number of migrating monarchs along the north shore of Lake Erie has been stable [mean: -3.05% per year, credibility interval (CI): -13.15, 9.97], which is consistent with changes being observed on the wintering grounds. Only migration counts collected between 1995 and 2018 at the Long Point sites demonstrated significant abundance declines (5.25% per year, CI: -8.60, -1.39), which is a similar results to previous analysis of this dataset. Opportunities for future research are discussed within the context of using monarch count data for future conservation efforts.																			0013-8746	1938-2901				NOV	2020	113	6					461	467		10.1093/aesa/saaa021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saaa021													WOS:000595478900006
J	Liu, Y; Chen, HP; Wang, HJ; Qiu, YB				Liu, Yong; Chen, Huopo; Wang, Huijun; Qiu, Yubao			The Impact of the NAO on the Delayed Break-Up Date of Lake Ice over the Southern Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The changing characteristics of lake ice phenology over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are investigated using historical satellite retrieved datasets during 2002-15 in this study. The results indicate that the freezing process mainly starts in December, and the ice melting process generally occurs in April for most lakes. However, the changes in lake ice phenology have varied depending on the location in recent years, with delayed break-up dates and prolonged ice durations in the southern TP, but no consistent changes have occurred in the lakes in the northern TP. Further analysis presents a close connection between the variation in the lake ice break-up date/ice duration over the southern TP and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The positive NAO generally excites an anomalous wave activity that propagates southward from the North Atlantic to North Africa and, in turn, strengthens the African-Asian jet stream at its entrance. Because of the blocking effect of the TP, the enhanced westerly jet can be divided into two branches and the south branch flow can deepen the India-Myanmar trough, which further strengthens the anomalous cyclonic circulation and water vapor transport. Therefore, the increased water vapor transport from the northern Indian Ocean to the southern region of the TP can increase the snowfall over this region. The increased snow cover over the lake acts as an insulating layer and lowers the lake surface temperature in the following spring by means of snow-ice feedback activity, resulting in a delayed ice break-up date and the increased ice duration of the lakes over the southern TP in recent years.

Our aims were to compare reconstructed summer temperatures with observed (last 100 years) seasonal temperatures, to determine a potential climate warming break point in the temperature series and to assess the significance and rate of the climate warming trend at the study site. The reconstructed temperatures were consistent with a previous proxy record from Svalbard and showed good correlation with the meteorological observations from Bjornoya and Longyearbyen. From the current palaeoclimate record, we found a significant climate warming threshold in the 1930s, after which the temperatures rapidly increased. We also found that the climate warming trend was strong and statistically significant. Compared with the reconstructed Little Ice Age temperatures in late eighteenth century cooling culmination, the present day summer temperatures are >4 degrees C higher and the temperature increase since the 1930s has been 0.5 degrees C per decade. These results highlight the exceptionally rapid recent warming of southern Svalbard and add invaluable information on the seasonality of High Arctic climate change and Arctic amplification.

At least five exploratory wells were drilled in the vicinity of the KBFZ, but none were successful. Although the Na-K-Ca and Na-Li geothermometers indicate that the thermal waters discharging in the vicinity of Howard and Seigler Springs may have equilibrated at temperatures greater than 200-degrees-C, the spring temperatures and fluid discharges are low. Most thermal waters along the KBFZ contain > 100 mg/l Mg. High concentrations of dissolved magnesium are usually indicative of relatively cool hydrothermal systems. Dissolution of serpentine at shallow depths may contribute dissolved silica and magnesium to rising thermal waters. Most thermal waters are saturated with respect to amorphous silica at the measured spring temperature. Silica geothermometers and mixing models are useless because the dissolved silica concentration is not controlled by the solubility of either quartz or chalcedony. Cation geothermometry indicates the possibility of a high-temperature fluid (> 200-degrees-C) only in the vicinity of Howard and Seigler Springs. However, even if the fluid temperature is as high as that indicated by the geothermometers, the permeability may be low. Deuterium and oxygen-18 values of the thermal waters indicate that they recharged locally and became enriched in oxygen-18 by exchange with rock. Diluting meteoric water and the thermal water appear to have the same deuterium value. Lack of tritium in the diluted spring waters suggest that the diluting water is old.

J	Cui, LL; Hu, JF; Wang, X				Cui, Linlin; Hu, Jianfang; Wang, Xu			Spatiotemporal evolution of C3/C4 vegetation and its controlling factors in southern China since the last glacial maximum	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												To date, few research have been reported on the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China, and the main mechanism influencing the evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation is unclear. That makes it difficult for researchers to understand the competition mechanism of C-3 and C-4 plants under different climate environments and its relationship with the climate factors. It is also not conducive for researchers to assess the influence of future climate change on regional C-3/C-4 vegetation. Exactly, C-3/C-4 vegetation change in the regional-scale will have a significant impact on the global carbon cycle and agricultural production. Therefore, it is especially important to reconstruct the evolutionary history of C-3/C-4 vegetation in southern China and clarify the influencing mechanism of climate change. In this study, we systematically analyzed stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) of the long-chain n-alkanes in sediment samples from eight lakes and four peat profiles in southern China, to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of C-3/C-4 vegetation in these regions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and to investigate the climate factors that affect the C-4 plant abundance change in the research area. The integrated long-chain n-alkane (C-27-C-33) stable carbon isotope results of samples from Zhanjiang Huguangyan Maar Lake, Xingyun Lake, Lugu Lake and Dingnan peat showed that, from the LGM to the Early Holocene, C-4 plant relative abundance exhibited a gradually increasing trend from 21% to 34%. In the Middle Holocene, the C-4 plant abundance significantly declined and reached a lowest value of 10%. In space, the C-4 plant abundance generally exhibited a gradually declining trend from south to north in the LGM and the Early Holocene, while it showed an opposite trend in the Holocene Climate Optimum (6.0 cal ka BP). It reflected that the main influencing factor on C-4 plants spatial distribution was changing from temperature to precipitation. This study indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting C-4 plant distribution in southern China, however, when the temperature condition was appropriate, an increase in precipitation (especially more spring precipitation) would reduce the competitive advantages of C-4 plants. Therefore, the combination of temperature and seasonal precipitation was the important factor that determines the C-3/C-4 vegetation proportion change in the southern China. Under the premise that the temperature will rise and precipitation will increase in the future, the reduction of a competitive advantage for the C-4 plants could affect agricultural production in China.

In this study, we performed a systematic seven-month long monitoring of the reproduction dynamics of marbled crayfish population in an anthropogenic lake in continental Croatia. Crayfish were caught monthly by applying the baited stick catch method. We recorded pleopodal fecundity and the number of hatched juveniles in each monthly catch and a random selection of individuals (20 per month) was dissected to determine the ovarian fecundity. Obtained fecundity parameters were correlated with crayfish size (total length, weight and pleon size), body condition (Fulton's condition factor), organosomatic indices (hepatosomatic index: HSI and gonadosomatic index: GSI) and compared with available literature data on marbled crayfish from laboratory-reared or wild populations. Based on the obtained data, we identified two potential reproductive peaks in early summer and mid autumn. However, the continuous presence of individuals with mature ovarian eggs and glair glands throughout almost the entire monitoring period indicates potential reproduction throughout June to November. Ovarian egg number and number of hatched juveniles was significantly correlated with crayfish size and Fulton's condition factor, while GSI exhibited significant variations among analyzed months and was positively correlated with HSI. The number of hatched juveniles in our study was significantly lower compared to literature data for marbled crayfish from populations in the wild and laboratory-reared populations. Collected data offer insights into the understudied reproduction dynamics of marbled crayfish in the wild and represent baseline information for predicting its invasion dynamics and risks of its further spread in this region.

The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of high concentrations of these salts on wetland biogeochemistry. Sediment cores were collected in fall and spring from a freshwater wetland fringing an urban kettle lake (Asylum Lake, Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and incubated for 100 days in deionized water (control) or with treatments of 1 or 5 g/L CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O or 5 g/L NaCl to simulate addition of road salt deciers. At monthly intervals, cores were sliced into three depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm) and pore waters extracted for analysis of pH, total alkalinity and dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), PO (4) (-3) , NH3, H2S, SO4 (-2), Na, K, Mg, and Ca. Changes in solid phase geochemistry were assessed by measuring the percent organic matter and the distribution of Fe and Mn among four operationally defined sediment fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, reducible, oxidizable) in the control and treatment cores. Addition of NaCl, and especially CaCl2, stimulated significant growth of microbial mats at the core sediment-water interface and led to decreased pH and increased concentrations of Mn(II), Fe(II) and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) in the sediment pore waters. This study demonstrates that the influx of road salt deciers is likely to have a significant impact on biogeochemical cycling in wetland sediments.

J	Li, JF; Liu, XQ				Li, Junfeng; Liu, Xingqi			Orbital- and suborbital-scale changes in the East Asian summer monsoon since the last deglaciation	HOLOCENE												The variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) has far-reaching effects on the global climate system and the environment, and full understanding of the variability and dynamics of the EASM contributes to predictions of its future behavior. Here, we present a well-dated mineralogical and total organic carbon record from a saline inland lake in northern China which provides a robust archive of the EASM evolution since 16.0 cal. ka BP. Our record reveals a series of rapid and frequent millennial-scale climatic fluctuations during the last deglaciation; these fluctuations are documented by changes in the abundances of mirabilite, bloedite, and gypsum, which appear to record the Oldest Dryas, the BOlling-AllerOd warm period, and the Younger Dryas. The peak EASM moisture occurred in the early and middle Holocene, which was punctuated by a prominent and abrupt weak monsoon interval that occurred synchronously with the 8.2 cal. ka BP cold event. This moisture maximum was terminated at 6.9-5.9 cal. ka BP by a warm-dry event marked by the deposition of gaylussite. Subsequently, the EASM gradually weakened over the late Holocene. The EASM moisture patterns reconstructed from Anguli-nuur Lake display good consistency with records from northern China, as revealed by a regional comparison; moreover, the recorded changes are synchronous with those of the Indian summer monsoon moisture patterns, as revealed by a comparison with the stalagmite records of southern China. Our reconstruction shows that the EASM has responded broadly to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation forcing on orbital time scales since the last deglaciation; thus, insolation is the primary factor that controls regional hydrological variations in the Asian monsoonal domain. The suborbital-scale events are related to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and a slowdown of this circulation would lead to a southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone and a weakening of the EASM.

The distinct physical characteristics of the water flow (water depth, current speed) at different tidal regimes (spring tide and neap tide) were also considered. Median filtration rates ranged 5.0-45.0 l m(-2) h(-1), despite the lack of dense bivalve beds or reefs. Based on median filtration rates of benthic communities on the studied substrate types, a model we developed showed that seagrass bed areas retained 15% of suspended particles during spring tide and 47% during neap tide. These retention efficiencies were much higher than those observed on mud flats (2.8% during spring tide, and 8% during neap tide), sand flats of finer grain size (8.8% during spring tide, and 50% during neap tide), and sand flats of coarser grain size (7% during spring tide, and 31% during neap tide). Removal of particles from water column was higher during the ebb tide than during flow tide, with particles of < 5 mu m diameter (especially diatoms, flagellates, and small-sized particulate matter) being the most commonly removed.

High-resolution paleoecological records from Lake Malawi show no significant cooling associated with the Mount Toba supereruption at ca. 75 ka	GEOLOGY												The impact of the ca. 75 ka Mount Toba (Indonesia) supereruption on regional and global climate has been controversial. East Africa is pivotal for qualifying this impact, specifically in addressing a hypothesis that this eruption caused a volcanic winter leading to a genetic bottleneck in anatomically modern human populations. If the Toba eruption caused a volcanic winter in East Africa, effects should be recorded in sediments from climatologically sensitive ecosystems. In deep tropical lakes, cooler temperatures would have reduced the density contrast between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, causing increased mixing, hypolimnion oxygenation, and enhanced nutrient advection. Such environmental changes produce noticeable and predictable responses in lake fossil assemblages and sediment loading. Here we present the first paleoecological evidence from East Africa of environmental conditions surrounding the eruption in a high-resolution (similar to 8-9 yr) analysis of two cores collected by the Lake Malawi Drilling Project. These cores contain an undisturbed record of sedimentation before, during, and after deposition of the youngest Toba Tuff. Concentrations of climate-sensitive ecological indicators such as phantom midges, diatoms, and other algae through a >270 yr interval bracketing the Toba cryptotephra show no unusual or sustained deviations from background variability within Lake Malawi associated with the hypothesized post-Toba cooling. We find no evidence for significantly enhanced mixing or ecosystem disturbance that would be anticipated following a volcanic winter.

Their ecology; based on major water parameters (i.e., temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity), and biogeographical distribution in North America were studied. Among these 14 species, 9 (Ilyocypris bradyi, I, gibba, Darwinula stevensoni, Candona candida, Heterocypris incongruens, Herpetocypris reptans, H. chevreuxi, Prionocypris canadensis, P. longiforma) are new records for Nevada's ostracod fauna, while 3 (H. reptans, Il canadensis, and Cypria turneri) are new species for Oregon. H, reptans, P. canadensis, and Heterocypris salina are also recorded as new for the ostracod literature of Idaho. Scottia pseudobrowniana, collected from Nevada, is a new ostracod species for the United States. The occurrence of 5 Holarctic species in the northern Great Basin area ma!: suggest a possible historical relationship with the European ostracod fauna.

The persistence of a chlorophyll spectral biosignature from Martian evaporite and spring analogues under Mars-like conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY												Spring and evaporite deposits are considered two of the most promising environments for past habitability on Mars and preservation of biosignatures. Manitoba, Canada hosts the East German Creek (EGC) hypersaline spring complex, and the post impact evaporite gypsum beds of the Lake St. Martin (LSM) impact. The EGC complex has microbial mats, sediments, algae and biofabrics, while endolithic communities are ubiquitous in the LSM gypsum beds. These communities are spectrally detectable based largely on the presence of a chlorophyll absorption band at 670 nm; however, the robustness of this feature under Martian surface conditions was unclear. Biological and biology-bearing samples from EGC and LSM were exposed to conditions similar to the surface of present day Mars (high UV flux, 100 mbar, anoxic, CO2 rich) for up to 44 days, and preservation of the 670 nm chlorophyll feature and chlorophyll red-edge was observed. A decrease in band depth of the 670 nm band ranging from similar to 16 to 80% resulted, with correlations seen in the degree of preservation and the spatial proximity of samples to the spring mound and mineral shielding effects. The spectra were deconvolved to Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Pancam and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mastcam science filter bandpasses to investigate the detectability of the 670 nm feature and to compare with common mineral features. The red-edge and 670 nm feature associated with chlorophyll can be distinguished from the spectra of minerals with features below similar to 1000 nm, such as hematite and jarosite. However, distinguishing goethite from samples with the chlorophyll feature is more problematic, and quantitative interpretation using band depth data makes little distinction between iron oxyhydroxides and the 670 nm chlorophyll feature. The chlorophyll spectral feature is observable in both Pancam and Mastcam, and we propose that of the proposed EXOMARS Pancam filters, the PHYLL filter is best suited for its detection.					; Stromberg, Jessica/IYJ-2591-2023	Rice, Melissa/0000-0002-8370-4139; Stromberg, Jessica/0000-0002-7412-3535													1473-5504	1475-3006				JUL	2014	13	3					203	223		10.1017/S1473550413000402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1473550413000402													WOS:000337760300002

The lacustrine muds consisted of alternating dark-colored (rich in diatom valves, clay, and organic matter) and light-colored (mainly diatom valves) laminae. The greenish/light-brown granules were predominately preserved in frustules of the genus Aulacoseira preserved in the dark-colored laminae. The dark-colored laminae were inferred to have formed annually under stratified water caused by surface water warming in summer that caused the formation of an organic-rich anoxic layer on the lake bottom that favored granule preservation. The good preservation of cytoplasmic masses in dark-colored laminae suggested a cause for diatom assemblage periodicity, a phenomenon that was commonly noted in temperate lakes: the cells containing these masses could be potential seed stocks for subsequent spring blooms. Frustules of the most abundant granule-containing species, Aulacoseira nipponica (Skvortzow) Tuji, in the dark-colored laminae of the Early Holocene muds were abundant in the overlying light-colored laminae, suggesting that these species reproduced abundantly in springtime yielding a massive diatom bloom.																			0022-3646					APR	2006	42	2					270	279		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00192.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00192.x													WOS:000236549100002
J	WISSINGER, SA; WHITEMAN, HH				WISSINGER, SA; WHITEMAN, HH			FLUCTUATION IN A ROCKY-MOUNTAIN POPULATION OF SALAMANDERS - ANTHROPOGENIC ACIDIFICATION OR NATURAL VARIATION	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												We monitored the demographics of the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum as part of a community-wide study on the effects of acidification in sub-alpine (elevation 3600 m) ponds in central Colorado. A decline in A. t. nebulosum at this site from 1982 to 1988 has been hypothesized to result from embryonic mortality during a pulse of acidity that accompanies snowmelt in spring. Since 1988 we have monitored salamander population size, reproduction, and recruitment, and compared survival and individual growth rates among ponds which differ five-fold in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). Larval recruitment fluctuated dramatically from year to year, but we found no evidence that survival of either embryos or larvae was affected by pH. In each year, the pulse of snowmelt acidification was either benign, or occurred earlier than egg deposition. During 1990 and 1991 we followed individual egg masses and found that embryonic survival was high in all ponds and did not differ between high and low ANC ponds. In permanent ponds, survival of first-year larvae was high and independent of pH. Within cohorts, second-year larvae were actually larger in ponds with low ANC than in high ANC ponds. The largest source of mortality in the population between 1988 and 1991 was related to pond drying; about half of all hatchlings that survived to July perished in autumn when many of the ponds dried. Our results suggest that fluctuation in hydroperiod is as viable a working hypothesis as snowmelt acidification for the recent decline in this population. Our water chemistry data show that many ponds at Mexican Cut remain poorly buffered and that this acid-sensitive watershed should continue to be closely monitored.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				DEC	1992	26	4					377	391		10.2307/1565114	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1565114													WOS:A1992KD17900005

It is a terminal lake, surrounded by mountains rising to 3500 m a.s.l. The Lake Van Basin is divided into three geological and morphological units: (1) the mostly metamorphic Bitlis Massif pertaining to the Bitlis suture zone to the south-west; (2) Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks (carbonates and volcanics) between the lake and the Turkish-Iranian border, and (3) volcanoes and volcanic products extending from the west to the north-east of the lake. The variety of the geomorphological landscapes around the lake is exceptionally high, with (i) some of the most impressive dormant volcanoes of Turkey; (ii) young (Late Pleistocene to recent) volcanic features such as a lake-filled caldera on top of the beheaded Nemrut Volcano, the solitary Suphan Volcano (the "Tushpa" God of the Urartians which dominates the lake by >1000 m), the fresh basaltic lava flows of the Tendurek Volcano, etc.; (iii) extensive lake terraces filling large valleys where they record impressive variations in lake level at least since the last 200 ka; (iv) travertine mounds associated with fault lines and river valleys; (v) karstic landscapes in the Bitlis Range and in the Tertiary limestones to the north-west, where they are covered by Nemrut ignimbrites and Suphan basalt and obsidian flows; (vi) glacial imprints on the summits of the Bitlis Range and of the Suphan; (vii) active landslides in marine sediments forming the slopes in the south-eastern basin; (viii) strong influences of tectonics on the relief, etc. Like in all Eastern Anatolia, high altitude pastures attract since millennia long-distance migrations of sheep herds seasonally switching between the southern plateaus in Syria and Iraq in winter, and Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus in summer.

The swan goose (Anser cygnoides) has been listed as a globally vulnerable species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. This species currently winters almost exclusively in China and is mostly concentrated on lakes in the middle and lower catchment of the Yangtze River floodplain, especially in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi province and some sites in Anhui province. In the past few years, the population of A. cygnoides has fluctuated. To protect this fragile Anatidae species, long-term and accurate population estimation is both necessary and urgent. In this study, we evaluated the change in numbers and distribution of A. cygnoides by comparing surveys conducted in 2004 and 2005 with more recent ones conducted in 2015 and 2016. A reduction in the count number of this species occurred in the survey sites. After a statistical Mann-Whitney U test, the count numbers of A. cygnoides decreased significantly at the survey sites in Anhui province and the abundance decrease at the survey sites in Poyang Lake was only marginally significant. The inaccessibility of the new sites revealed by satellite tracking impeded a more prudent and comprehensive estimate of the population change. Satellite tracking technology may be a tool to consider for increasing the efficiency of data acquisition. Information transmitted from satellite tracking devices can help us to better understand the species' behavior and wintering habitat. This technology has the potential to substitute costly and time-consuming field surveys. Conservation designs and management plans must be created for specific national nature reserves and key wintering sites. A more efficient long-term species monitoring system with improved spatial coverage should be conducted to safeguard wintering A. cygnoides.					; zhu, qin/KVZ-4206-2024	Zhu, Qin/0000-0001-7042-6806; Zhang, Junjian/0009-0006-0643-6579; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303													2071-1050					MAR 1	2019	11	5							1398	10.3390/su11051398	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11051398													WOS:000462661000182

In this study, data of chlorophyll a and related environmental parameters were weekly gathered at 15 sampling sites in Xiangxi Bay of Three-Gorges Reservoir (TGR, China) to evaluate patterns of temporal coherence for phytoplankton during spring bloom and test if spatial heterogeneity of nutrient and inorganic suspended particles within a single ecosystem influences synchrony of spring phytoplankton dynamics. There is a clear spatial and temporal variation in chlorophyll a across Xiangxi Bay. The degree of temporal coherence for chlorophyll a between pairs of sites located in Xiangxi Bay ranged from -0.367 to 0.952 with mean and median values of 0.349 and 0.321, respectively. Low levels of temporal coherence were often detected among the three stretches of the bay (Down reach, middle reach and upper reach), while high levels of temporal coherence were often found within the same reach of the bay. The relative difference of DIN between pair sites was the strong predictor of temporal coherence for chlorophyll a in down and middle reach of the bay, while the relative difference in Anorganic Suspended Solids was the important factor regulating temporal coherence in middle and upper reach. Contrary to many studies, these results illustrate that, in a small geographic area (a single reservoir bay of approximately 25 km), spatial heterogeneity influence synchrony of phytoplankton dynamics during spring bloom and local processes may override the effects of regional processes or dispersal.					; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012; Ye, Lin/H-2441-2011; Wang, Lan/AAH-1886-2019; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	wang, lan/0000-0001-6843-3003; Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; 													1434-2944	1522-2632					2009	94	6					656	672		10.1002/iroh.200911176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200911176													WOS:000273415100003

We monitored Marrecas weekly/monthly (n = 116) from 2014 to 2018. C. furcoides avoided summer and preferred spring, which displayed optimal temperatures for the species (15-23 degrees C), exhibiting in October 2014 the maximum density ever reported (15,865 ind. mL-1). It showed direct correlation with iron, manganese, and turbidity; evidencing dependency of a mixing regime which triggers cyst resuspension (interrupting cysts' dormancy). Cryptomonas spp., Komma caudata, Discostella stelligera and after 2016 also Chlamydomonas sp. were the only species present during C. furcoides blooms. Komma caudata, Cryptomonas sp., and Aulacoseira alpigena correlated positively with the invader, as all prefer turbulent waters. C. furcoides correlated negatively with Chlorophyta (mainly Chlamydomonas spp.) which is vulnerable to mixing, and Bacillariophyta (Urosolenia eriensis and Discostella stelligera) that prefers clear waters. It also showed a consistent negative correlation with Ochrophyta (Mallomonas spp.), Cyanobacteria (Microcystis), and Urosolenia eriensis; suggesting competition for resources. Furthermore, it correlated negatively with species richness. Notwithstanding, based on the decrease of blooms, the phytoplankton community appears to have reached a more stable state (homogeneous species representation). However, further monitoring is required for confirmation.					; de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013; Pereira, Leonel/M-3527-2013	Rojas Castillo, Oscar Alberto/0000-0002-0176-9685; Pereira, Leonel/0000-0002-6819-0619													0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2023	101								126080	10.1016/j.limno.2023.126080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2023.126080		MAY 2023											WOS:001012781200001

Estimation of ice thickness on large northern lakes from AMSR-E brightness temperature measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An ice thickness retrieval algorithm utilizing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed and applied to Great Bear Lake (GBL) and Great Slave Lake (GSL), Northwest Territories, Canada, for the period 2002-2009. The temporal evolution of vertically polarized AMSR-E brightness temperature (T-B) at 18.7 GHz was explored to estimate ice thickness between the late freeze-up (ice-on) and early break-up (melt-onset) periods. The sensitivity of AMSR-E T-B at H and V polarizations to the seasonal evolution of ice thickness was examined statistically and with forward simulations of T-B using the most recent version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) model, which incorporates a freshwater ice layer. The strong relation found between T-B at 18.7 GHz V-pal and ice thickness was exploited for the development of a regression-based ice thickness retrieval algorithm. Simple linear regression equations allow for the estimation of ice thickness on a monthly basis from January to April; one, the Global equation, combines T-B data for GBL and GS', and two others, the Regional equations, use T-B data for each lake alone. Estimated late-winter ice thicknesses on GBL were determined to be on average 5-10 cm thicker than on GSL with the exception of ice season 2005-2006 when it was estimated to be 10 cm thicker on GSL. For both lakes the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 ice seasons experienced the thickest end-of-winter ice thicknesses, ranging from 130 to 134 cm on GBL and GSL The thinnest end-of-winter ice thicknesses were on average 120 cm on GBL (2005-2006) and 123 cm on GSL (2007-2008). Variability in air temperature, snowfall and subsequent redistribution by wind, and lake depth explain ice thickness variations within and between lakes over the seven winter seasons analyzed. Estimated ice thicknesses from AMSR-E compare well with coincident in situ measurements collected on GBL and GSL over a limited number of ice seasons and sites within the large passive microwave footprints (Mean Bias Error, MBE = 6 cm; Root Mean Square Error, RMSE = 19 cm).

Snowmelt and the hydrological interaction of forest-grassland ecosystems in Central Yakutia, eastern Siberia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In the last two decades the major focus of study in forest water and carbon balances in eastern Siberia has been on the effect of rain during the growing season. Little attention has been paid to the contribution of snowmelt water. The results of the present study indicate that weather conditions during the snowmelt period as well as the soil moisture conditions carried from the previous year's growing season strongly determined the water availability for the forest ecosystem at the beginning of the next growing season. In the forest-grassland intermingled ecosystem of lowland Central Yakutia, gradual snowmelt water flow from the forest into the adjacent grassland depressions increased when soil moisture was high and air temperature was low, whereas low soil moisture and high air temperatures accelerated soil thawing and consequently snowmelt water infiltration into the forest soil. We found that snow depth did not determine the volume of snowmelt water moving to the grassland depression since the thermokarst lake water level in the adjacent grassland was about 25 cm lower in 2005 than in May 2006, even though maximum snow depth reached 57 cm and 43 cm in the winter of 2004-05 and 2005-06, respectively. The contribution of snowmelt water to forest growth as well as the flow of water from the forest to the grasslands showed a strong annual variability. We conclude that warmer springs and high variability in precipitation regimes as a result of climate change will result in more snowmelt water infiltration into the forest soil when the previous year's precipitation is low while more snowmelt water will flow into the thermokarst lake when the previous year's precipitation is high.

However, most studies on under-ice zooplankton focus on low-land lakes over relatively short temporal scales; long-term under-ice zooplankton dynamics in mountain lakes remain largely unknown. We compared the under-ice zooplankton community (one sampling per year; n = 11) to that of the ice-free seasons (monthly samplings) of mountain Lake Tovel. The considered timeframe (2001-2023) covered the period of an ecosystem change linked to intensified autumn mixing. To avoid confounding the effect of this ecosystem change with a seasonal effect, we first investigated the general patterns of abundance and biomass of rotifers and crustaceans for the years considered to determine the periods conforming to the ecosystem change (period 1: weak mixing; period 2: strong mixing). Rotifers and crustaceans were sampled by a net (50 mu m mesh size) from 35 m depth to the surface. Rotifer abundance and biomass were higher in period 1 (the years 2001, 2003, 2011, 2014 and 2016) than in period 2 (the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023) conforming to the ecosystem change. We applied a taxonomic and functional perspective on zooplankton diversity as complementary approaches to investigate season and period differences. With two-way ANOVA (period and season effect) considering temporal dependence and heterogeneity of data, taxonomic indices (abundance, biomass, species richness) and functional indices (effective number of functional groups, effective number of common functional groups, functional richness) of rotifers showed higher mean values during period 1 than period 2, while taxonomic indices of crustaceans (species richness, effective number of common species, effective number of dominant species) showed the opposite pattern. Thus, the ecosystem change linked to altered mixing patterns favoured crustaceans over rotifers. NMDS ordinations with taxonomic (species identity) and functional diversity (functional entities and community weighted mean trait values) of rotifers showed a splitting between periods but generally not between seasons. The prevailing absence of seasonal differences was linked to the lake's cold-water temperature year-round. The similarity of rotifer functional feeding preferences of the last 2 years of period 2 (2022 and 2023) to that of period 1 indicated that mixing intensity was declining again, a result not shown by taxonomy. From the last autumn to under-ice sampling, Filinia terminalis, Kellicottia longispina, Keratella hiemalis, Polyarthra dolichoptera, Synchaeta kitina, S. lakowitziana, Bosmina longirostris and nauplii and adults of Cyclops strenuus increased in abundance that we attributed to reproduction under ice. Under-ice indicator taxa were only found during period 2, namely F. terminalis and S. lakowitziana. Our study showed that in mountain Lake Tovel the under-ice period is characterised by a similar high zooplankton diversity as during the ice-free period. Studies like ours, covering both taxonomic and functional diversity, are more needed to understand under-ice zooplankton communities.

High abundance of lactobacilli in the gut microbiome of honey bees during winter	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Honey bee gut microbiota play specific roles in promoting host growth and physiology by regulating the immune system, behavior, metabolism, and neurological processes. While the gut microbiota of honey bee queens, workers, and larvae has been extensively studied, less is known about the composition of gut microbiota in the winter worker bees. This study investigates the dynamics of the gut microbiota in overwintering adult worker bees, focusing on two commercial bee strains: Bolton (TM) bees and Mann Lake (TM) bees. These Apis mellifera strains were investigated under different storage conditions (indoor storage at 6 degrees C and outdoor storage in natural conditions) during the winter months (October, November, and December). Utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the microbial composition of the whole gut. We observed the Lactobacilli dominated in all the overwintering honey bee guts with a significantly higher abundance of unclassified Lactobacillus species in November, while Lactobacillus apis showed significantly higher abundance in October. Bolton bees exhibited significantly higher abundance levels of Bartonella (denoted as uncultured) and Bifidobacterium, along with an unexpected presence of Wolbachia. In contrast, Mann Lake bees demonstrated an increased abundance of Commensalibacter. Our results suggest that Shannon diversity is influenced by the month rather than by the bee strain or storage conditions. We also found significant differences in Bray Curtis diversity index by month. Overall, taxonomical abundance was not affected by whether the hives were stored outside or in constant temperature indoor storage. However, various bacterial species showed differences in abundance across different months, with slight variations observed between bee strains. Given the potential benefits of the honey bee gut microbiome for health and nutrition, our data suggests that the genus Lactobacillus may play a significant role in bee health during winter and overwintering storage.

Average gaseous OCP concentrations ranged from nondetect to 133 pg/m(3). Gaseous concentrations of hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin, and chlordanes were significantly greater (Mann Whitney test, p < 0.05) at Lake Erie than Lake Ontario. A multiple linear regression implied that both cropland and urban areas within 50 and 10 km buffer zones, respectively, were critical parameters to explain the total variability in atmospheric concentrations. Freely dissolved OCP concentrations (nondetect to 114 pg/L) were lower than previously reported. Aqueous half-lives generally ranged from 1.7 to 6.7 years. Nonetheless, concentrations of p,p'-DDE and chlordanes were higher than New York State Ambient Water Quality Standards for the protection of human health from the consumption of fish. Spatial distributions of freely dissolved OCPs in both lakes were influenced by loadings from areas of concern and the water circulation patterns. Flux calculations indicated net deposition of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, heptachlor-epoxide, and alpha- and beta-endosulfan (-0.02 to -33 ng/m(2)/day) and net volatilization of heptachlor, aldrin, trans-chlordane, and trans-nonachlor (0.0 to 9.0 ng/m(2)/day) in most samples.

To assess the effects of both nutrients and herbivory on water clarity, mean Secchi disk readings were computed for six seasonal periods for each year during 1900-1993 that had readings (71 years but not in all periods). We assigned each year one of three levels of nutrients and one of two levels of herbivory on the basis of data independent of Secchi readings to avoid circularity in our analyses. For each seasonal period, we tested for differences in Secchi readings attributable to nutrients, herbivory, and their interaction. Our results indicate that in years with high herbivory, water clarity was significantly greater during all periods including summer when blue-green algal blooms frequently occurred. Higher nutrient levels only led to decreased water clarity during the summer and destratification periods; water clarity was not affected by nutrient levels during other periods. Our analysis of Lake Mendota's long-term Secchi disk record indicates that herbivory can strongly influence water clarity in large eutrophic lakes, and that the greatest improvements in summer water clarity in those lakes may be achieved by combining phosphorus reduction programs with biomanipulation techniques to increase herbivory.

J	BROWN, AD; LUND, LJ				BROWN, AD; LUND, LJ			FACTORS CONTROLLING THROUGHFALL CHARACTERISTICS AT A HIGH-ELEVATION SIERRA-NEVADA SITE, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The composition of throughfall (TF) is influenced by wet and dry deposition on foliar surfaces and by chemical and biological interactions between rain and the foliage. The relative importance of these processes was investigated for TF collected in the summer months of 1985, 1986, and 1987 under three subalpine species, chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens Hjelmqvist), western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.), and willow (Salix orestera Schneider), in the Emerald Lake Watershed, Sequoia National Park, California. The depth of rain and days since the last storm were used to predict net-TF deposition in a multiple linear regression model. Dry deposition to needle surfaces had the greatest influence on western white pine TF composition. Net-TF data for this species were used to estimate mean dry deposition rates for the summer. These data show that NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- dry deposition rates exceed median summer wet deposition rates by 1.5,19, and 1.0 times, respectively. Willow foliage had the greatest influence on TF composition and western white pine the least. Estimated foliar release of cations and organic anions by willow during summer rain is a substantial fraction of annual wet deposition of those ions. Weak organic acid anions derived from foliar release are a significant component of net-TF in all three species, particularly willow, where summer fluxes of organic acids were at least 51% of the total estimated annual wet deposition of organic anions.																			0047-2425					JUL-AUG	1994	23	4					844	850		10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300040033x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300040033x													WOS:A1994NW83000032

Here, we reconstructed the history of chemical weathering intensity since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on clay mineral proxies [(illite/smectite)/(illite + chlorite) and illite crystallinity] obtained from Qionghai Lake sediments and examined its response to paleoclimate and SSM. Our findings indicate that the intensity of chemical weathering generally aligned with changes in paleoclimate, exhibiting strong chemical weathering intensity during warm and humid climate conditions. In addition, the intensity of chemical weathering basically tracks the evolution of the SSM since the LGM. Our results support the view that the highest SSM intensity occurred during the early-middle Holocene, followed by gradual weakening during the late Holocene, with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation being the primary driver of the SSM evolution. The variations of the SSM and the corresponding intensity of chemical weathering were also influenced by the cumulative effects of glacier boundary conditions, North Atlantic climate fluctuations, and Intertropical Convergence Zone migrations.

The fish, which were introduced from a local lake (donor lake), generally rangers from 12 to 16 cm in total length, and were stocked at densities of 117-177 fish ha(-1). The untreated lakes were highly acid, with minimum pH values and maximum inorganic aluminium concentrations (Al) during the spring of 4.6-4.7 and 118-151 mug L-1 respectively. In the limed lake, the corresponding values for pH and Al-i ranged between 5.8 and 6.6 and 5 and 19 mug L-1 respectively. Gill-netting in two subsequent years after the introduction yielded only a few recruits (0+) and one adult in one of the three acidified lakes in one year only. However, stocked perch reproduced successfully in both years in the limed lake. There was a significant linear relationship between the catches (CPUE) of juvenile perch (age 0+) in the different lakes in the autumn and the water quality in May (time of hatching), both in terms of Al-i (r(2)=0.934, P <0.05) and pH (r(2)=0.939, P <0.05). Our data suggest unsuccessful recruitment in waters of pH <5.1 and Al-i> 60 mug L-1.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1361	1366		10.1023/A:1013922420006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013922420006													WOS:000172012000075

After 3 summers, some salmon had reached 2.0-2.84 kg. In Papin Lake, salmon reached 1st sexual maturity after 3 summer growing seasons, age 2+. No natural propagation was successful due to the absence of an inflowing stream. The last catch of a landlocked salmon in Papin Lake was made at the end of June 1981.

The Curuai floodplain, composed of several temporally interconnected lakes, is permanently connected to the Amazon River via channels. Organic matter (OM) is imported to the floodplain from the Amazon River mainly during the rising water period and produced in the floodplain and exported to the river during high and falling water periods. No significant exchanges occurred during low water periods. The OM produced in the floodplain is characterized by low C/N ratios and by high chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a). The delta C-13 signature has a seasonal trend, with more negative delta C-13 values during the high water period than other periods. Delta C-14 results indicate that the bulk OM present in floodplain lakes is predominantly post-bomb (i.e., post-1950). Particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes exported by the Curuai floodplain represent 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively, of the POC and DOC annual fluxes in the mainstem Amazon River at Obidos but may reach up to 3.3% and 0.8% during falling water. Based on Delta C-14, delta C-13, Chl-a, and elemental analysis of the particulate organic matter, we demonstrate that floodplain lakes have intense phytoplankton and macrophyte primary production, which is partly exported to the main river channel. Floodplains are thus a significant source of modern and labile organic carbon to the river mainstem, where it can be rapidly degraded and recycled back to the atmosphere.

It is of value to know the proportion of the pollen assemblage derived from the lake catchment and that which was airborne. This has been a long-neglected issue for lakes from arid areas of central Asia. In this study, we used two modified Cour (M-Cour) traps in different biomes (steppe and desert) to collect airborne pollen in the enclosed Balikun Basin during the non-flowering season (late autumn to early winter). The pollen assemblages from the traps are similar with large proportions of herbaceous and (sub-)shrub taxa such as Artemisia and Chenopodioideae. This implies a shared long-distance transport component, in addition to pollen derived from the local vegetation. These xeromorphic species are ubiquitous in the inland desert and/or steppe areas beyond the lake basin, and their pollen is likely to be carried by the wind into lake sediments from a broad area, leading to high percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodioideae pollen in lake surface-sediments. Pollen types from upstream areas (e.g. Picea, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae) are barely found in samples from the river mouth and lake surface-sediments. Thus, we speculate that the transport of pollen by inflow streams makes little contribution to the overall pollen budget in Balikun Lake. This is probably related to the low transport capacity of the surface runoff into the lake, as precipitation is low and there is limited meltwater from snow and glaciers in the surrounding mountains. Pollen assemblages from the near-shore lakebed, which have a high percentage of Chenopodioideae pollen (74.8%), represent only the very local environment, reflecting the expansion of saline-alkali habitats rather than desert. Sedimentary archives from the near-shore lakebed will thus overestimate the desert Chenopodioideae pollen component and hence cause unreliable vegetation or climate reconstructions. We also found the local vegetation composition and pollen depositional processes could significantly bias the ratio of Artemisia/Chenopodioideae (A/C), reducing its effectiveness as an index to distinguish steppe from desert. We suggest using A/C ratios from lake surface-sediments which have a large airborne pollen source area in arid areas, as a better reference for down-core fossil pollen.					; li, yuan/GZH-3511-2022; Chen, Xuemei/KCL-6714-2024	An, Cheng-Bang/0000-0002-4443-0518; Fang, Yiman/0000-0001-8166-2791													1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2021	123								107332	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107332		JAN 2021											WOS:000615921500003

Temporal and spatial carbon dioxide concentration patterns in a small boreal lake in relation to ice-cover dynamics	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission estimates from inland waters commonly neglect the ice-cover season. To account for CO2 accumulation below ice and consequent emissions into the atmosphere at ice-melt we combined automatically-monitored and manually-sampled spatially-distributed CO2 concentration measurements from a small boreal ice-covered lake in Sweden. In early winter, CO2 accumulated continuously below ice, whereas, in late winter, CO2 concentrations remained rather constant. At ice-melt, two CO2 concentration peaks were recorded, the first one reflecting lateral CO2 transport within the upper water column, and the second one reflecting vertical CO2 transport from bottom waters. We estimated that 66%-85% of the total CO2 accumulated in the water below ice left the lake at ice-melt, while the remainder was stored in bottom waters. Our results imply that CO2 accumulation under ice and emissions at ice-melt are more dynamic than previously reported, and thus need to be more accurately integrated into annual CO2 emission estimates from inland waters.

Kastoria, Greece):: steady-state dominance of Limnothrix redekei, Microcystis aeruginosa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton species composition and seasonal succession were examined in Lake Kastoria during the period November 1998-October 1999. A total of 67 species and 19 functional groups were identified. Only 4 out of the 67 species, all Cyanobacteria, were dominant (Limnothrix redekei, Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Aphanizomenon gracile). Diatoms were rare, not only in terms of species number, but also in terms of biomass (contributing < 5% to the total phytoplankton biomass) in relation to the rather low silicon concentrations throughout the year. The functional groups S1, S-N, M and H1 were found dominant in the lake. The species A. gracile (functional group H1) behaved like the species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (functional group S-N) which is tolerant to mixing and poor light conditions. The phytoplankton seasonal succession showed similar patterns in all six sampling stations, both at the surface and the bottom water layer, with minor differences during Microcystis aeruginosa dominance. Two steady-state phases were identified within a year lasting for 4 months under relatively stable physical conditions. In these steady-states, the Limnothrix redekei persistent dominance under low light availability and low inorganic nitrogen has been explained by its specific ability such as buoyancy regulation to exploit resources in the water column. Moreover, high population densities over the winter and before the development of daphnids may contribute to the steady-state dominance of Limnothrix. Different niches separated vertically in the water column is one of the explanations for the Limnothrix-Microcystis steady-state when a replacement between the two species was observed in different water layers and areas of the lake. Long lasting steady-states of Cyanobacteria observed in Lake Kastoria and in other Mediterranean and tropical freshwaters may indicate influence of warm climate properties on phytoplankton dynamics.

The study presented herein investigates the effect of wind on the eutophication of the lake, by using a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model coupled with a 2D water quality model. The 2D water quality model looks in particular at the water quality situation of Lake Taihu in the year 2008 and predicts future changes in the algae bloom situation. The Delft3D modelling tool was used to build the hydrodynamic model based on the measured geomorphologic and meteorological data of Lake Taihu. Three different sets of wind conditions (no wind, constant wind and measured wind) were considered as wind effects on the water level and velocity, in both the wet and dry seasons. Based on the calibrated hydrodynamic model a 2D water quality model was built which was calibrated based on estimated data for nutrient loads. A one-year hydrodynamic simulation was performed, in order to determine the water quality situation of Lake Taihu. The estimated nutrient loads included total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. The estimates are based on the population of cities around Lake Taihu, and the wastewater treatment plant capacity of the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where the main sources of pollutants come from. Two time periods (spring and autumn) of algae blooms development for the year 2008 are presented. The results of the study indicate that: 1) the hydrodynamic model with constant wind conditions (southeast, 5m/s) showed better results than the one where measured wind conditions were used, simply because the measured wind data is insufficient at the moment; 2) the model clearly represents the water quality to an acceptable degree; 3) an increase in population in the area would lead to an increase in the maximum value of algae concentration from 35% to 76%; 4) if there is an improvement in technology at the wastewater treatment plant, then the maximum value of algae concentration will be between 17% and 42%.					; Popescu, Ioana/AAI-4968-2021; Mynett, Arthur/A-9923-2012; Yue, Chao/C-2535-2015	Popescu, Ioana/0000-0002-1009-5424; 													1582-9596	1843-3707				MAY	2013	12	5					1031	1044																WOS:000325283100023

Microcystin profiles in European noble crayfish Astacus astacus and water in Lake Steinsfjorden, Norway	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Lake Steinsfjorden, an important noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) habitat, is often affected by blooms of Planktothrix spp. that produce microcystins (MCs). A poor correlation between MCs by ELISA in the water and in crayfish tissue in a study in 2015 prompted further investigation by LC-HRMS. LC-HRMS analyses of filters from water samples and on selected crayfish tissue extracts from the 2015 study revealed the presence of known and previously unreported MCs. Crayfish samples from May and June 2015 were dominated by MCs from the Planktothrix bloom, whereas in September novel MCs that appeared to be metabolites of MC-LR were dominant, even though neither these nor MC-LR were detected in the water in 2015. A water sample from October 2016 also showed MCs typical of Planktothrix (i.e., [D-Asp3]-and [D-Asp3,Dhb7]MC-RR and-LR), but low levels of MC RR and MC-LR were detected in the lake water for the first time. In late summer and autumn, the MC profiles of crayfish were dominated by the homonorvaline (Hnv) variant MC-LHnv, a putative metabolite of MC-LR. Taken together, ELISA, LC-HRMS and previous PCR analyses showed that although Planktothrix was part of the crayfish diet, it was not the sole source of MCs in the crayfish. Possibly, crayfish in Lake Steinsfjorden may be ingesting MCs from benthic cyanobacteria or from contaminated prey. Therefore, information on the cyanobacterial or MC content in the water column cannot safely be used to make predictions about MC concentrations in the crayfish in Lake Steinsfjorden. Interestingly, the results also show that targeted LC-MS analysis of the crayfish would at times have underestimated their MC content by nearly an order of magnitude, even if all previously reported MC variants had been included in the analysis.

Drivers of anomalous surface melting over Ingrid Christensen Coast, East Antarctica	POLAR SCIENCE												Antarctica contains 90% of the Earth ' s ice; if it melts, it can significantly contribute to the rise in global sea levels. Over Antarctica, short-term atmospheric warming events have led to significant surface melt in summer. Understanding the conditions of such warming events and subsequent surface melt is highly prioritized in Polar Research. The austral summer of 2016-17 witnessed the largest melt duration of the 21 st century over Ingrid Christensen Coast (ICC), East Antarctica. Being situated on the grounded ice near four research stations, understanding the melt over the region has both scientific and operational importance. Here, we investigate the drivers of four major melt events identified over ICC for the austral summer of 2016-17 using the reanalysis dataset, ERA5. The first melt event, coinciding with the season ' s highest air temperature, was triggered by high turbulent heat flux from strong katabatic winds, while the rest of the events were triggered by low-level, liquid cloud -induced longwave radiation. During the melt events, anomalous high pressure ridges were present over the continent causing low pressure systems to remain stationary for an extended period and direct warm, moist air towards the ICC, facilitating melting. The present study observed melting occurring above the grounding zone, and if such melting extends to a larger scale beyond ice shelves, it could raise significant concerns regarding the hydrodynamics and stability of ice sheets in the future.						, Dr Laluraj C M/0000-0001-6826-0608													1873-9652	1876-4428				JUN	2024	40								101069	10.1016/j.polar.2024.101069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polar.2024.101069		JUN 2024											WOS:001258164300001

In this study, we obtained a sediment core from the Napahai wetland in southwestern China and analyzed geochemical indices, including loss on ignition at 550 degrees C, carbonate content, as well as magnetic susceptibility, and ash-free bulk density, to investigate the peatland development since the last deglaciation. Results show that peat formation at ca. 13.3 cal. kyr BP in the Napahai wetland was likely attributed to climate warming during the Bolling-Allerod period. The results clearly suggest the peat continuously accumulated from 13.3 to 7.2 cal. kyr BP and weakened from the Middle to Late Holocene (7.2-1.5 cal. kyr BP), indicating notably wet conditions during the Early to Middle Holocene (11.8-7.2 cal. kyr BP) and a clear long-term drying trend in the Middle to Late Holocene. A comparison of the Napahai records with other monsoon intensity and related hydroclimatic records in areas dominated by the ISM suggests that the development of the Napahai peatland at orbital-suborbital timescales corresponded to the variations in the ISM intensity and the summer insolation.

In the study area of Scanno Lake and Sagittario River (Central Italy), a limestone rockslide-avalanche formed a lake, which has an outlet that is occasionally active, showing infiltration into the rockslide dam. Several springs are present at the lake's base and are partly fed by seepage through the rockslide debris. Piezometric surveys, discharge measurements, pumping tests and chemical analyses are tools used to build a conceptual model of the groundwater flow and to evaluate the flow through the rockslide debris. Seasonal water isotopic signatures validate the assumed model, showing a mixing of infiltration recharge and groundwater seepage throughout the rockslide debris. Various recharge areas have been found for springs, pointing out those directly fed by the rockslide debris aquifer. Hypotheses about seasonal groundwater mixing between the regional carbonate aquifer and the rockslide debris aquifer are supported by isotope results. Seasonal changes in groundwater table level due to recharge and surface losses from seasonal outlet have been correlated with isotopic groundwater composition from the rockslide debris aquifer and the downstream springs; this relationship highlights the role of the rockslide dam body on the hydrodynamics of the studied area. Relationships between surface waters and groundwater in the area have been completely understood on the basis of water isotopic fingerprinting, finally obtaining a complete evaluation of groundwater renewable resources and its regimen.

In order to survive, birds have to adapt to the deteriorating environment. In this study, we surveyed the availability of food resources to Hooded Cranes in a degraded wetland. We found that cranes adopted flexible foraging strategies in response to the abundance and availability of different food resources in mosaic wetland landscapes at different periods during winter. The results also showed that the deeper the food was buried, the more time the cranes spent, and foraging frequency and foraging success rate were based on food abundance. It provided an evidence basis for the protection and management of waterbirds, especially Hooded Cranes. Abstract Wetlands are disappearing or degrading at an unprecedented rate due to the increase in human encroachment and disturbance, eventually leading to habitat loss for waterbirds, which is the primary cause of the decline in the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) population. The Hooded Cranes have to constantly adjust their foraging strategies to survive to cope with this situation. In order to study how cranes respond to food resources in mosaic habitat, we surveyed a total of 420 food quadrats and 736 behavioral samples from three habitats during three wintering periods in Shengjin Lake and Caizi Lake. We measured temporal and between-habitat differences in foraging time budget, foraging frequency, and foraging success rate. Akaike's information criterion was selected between the models of food abundance and availability. The results indicated that the wintering cranes spent the majority of their time (66.55%) foraging and shifted their foraging behaviors based upon food abundance and availability in different habitats. Our analyses also indicated that cranes were willing to forage more food with poor sediment penetrability in sub-optimal habitats. Foraging time budget was based on the food depth, and the foraging frequency and foraging success rate were based on food abundance. Cranes adopted flexible foraging strategies in response to the alternative food resources in mosaic wetland habitats, as it could mitigate the negative impacts of habitat loss and facilitate survival.

The bird species of Kumasir lake (Kahramanmaras-Turkey) and a view of environmental ethics on sustainable wetland management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Kumasir lake is located next to towns of Donuklu and Fatih, nine km west of Kahramanmaras city center, the region of east Mediterranean, Turkey. This lake is of crucial importance from the point of native and immigrant birds. We located 17 bird species in this area during our observations carried out in the spring and autumn of 2005-2006. These were Ciconia ciconia L., Anas platyrhynchos L., Accipiter nisus L., Accipiter brevipes L., Fulica atra L., Columba palumbus L., Merops apiaster L., Upupa epops L., Alauda arvensis L., Motacilla flava L., Turdus merula L., Acrocephalus scirpaceus L., Regulus regulus L., Garrulus glandarius L., Corvus corax L., Fringilla coelebs L., Hirundo rustica L Among observed 17 species; 6 of them were immigrant and remaining I I of them were native birds. Kumasir lake is surrounded by wetland of Amik and Gavur lake. Since it was greatly dried, it was transformed to farmland. Consequently, the birds lost most of their nests and settlements. However, not taken in the care of environmental ethic values, the wastewaters of the villages drain to lake reservoir; herbicides and insecticides used for agriculture are polluting the water, reeds have been burned, the lake's reeds are getting dry by the irrigation for the farmland. So, the wetland ecosystem is being affected negatively by these factors. On the other hand, the birds are exposed to illegal and unlawful hunting. For this reasons, this lake must be taken into a management regime of sustainable wetland (protection profiting balance) and used techniques of participation planning via the process of sustainable natural resources and planning,					İnaç, Selçuk/MEO-9227-2025														0254-8704					MAY	2008	29	3					411	414											18972701					WOS:000256207900025
J	Glinska-Lewczuk, K				Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna			Water quality dynamics of oxbow lakes in young glacial landscape of NE Poland in relation to their hydrological connectivity	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In this paper, the functioning of floodplain lakes was documented on the basis of water quality and hydrological data in a postglacial river floodplain representative of the temperate climatic zone. Nine oxbow lakes in the middle section of the River Lyna floodplain located in north-eastern Poland were investigated. Three groups of oxbow lakes distinguished on the basis of hydrological connectivity and retention time (lotic, semi-lotic and lentic) showed significant spatial and temporal differences in chemical parameters of water and matter cycling in relation to water table fluctuations, sediment character and aquatic plant diversity. Lotic habitats had parameters similar to river water, in particular to EC, main cation and anion concentrations. When the connection to a river is maintained, oxbow lakes prolong their existence due to multiple exchanges of matter. Very short-term water retention in lotic habitats is not favorable for sedimentation of such particles as Ca or SO4, Na, K, Cl which are easily moved by river water. This is contrary to lentic (disconnected) water bodies, where retention time is incomparably longer and internal cycling limits ecosystem productivity. Disconnected oxbow lakes undergo the highest seasonal variations in nutrient availability related in summer to intensive development of free-floating phytocenoses that limit light and aeration conditions, whereas and in winter to long-term ice cover. The presented data indicate an important function of oxbow lakes that relies on the regulation of nutrient transfer towards rivers. The effectiveness of TIN withdrawal from lentic oxbow lakes is estimated as 75%, whereas and in other macroelements from 50% to 82%, when compared to the lotic type. The retention ability of natural riverine ecosystems should be considered in proper designs of created wetlands. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Post-Dispersal Seed Predation, Germination, and Seedling Survival of Five Rare Florida Scrub Species in Intact and Degraded Habitats	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Knowledge of seed ecology is important for the restoration of ecosystems degraded by anthropogenic activities. Current efforts to preserve and reintroduce populations of plant species endemic to Florida are hindered by a lack of information on demographic responses to human alteration. Comparisons of seed removal, germination, and establishment in both intact and degraded habitats will aid in management decisions for species in need of protection. Our objectives were to assess the impact of post-dispersal seed predation on plant populations in degraded and intact habitats, and to investigate the effects of habitat and microsite on seed germination and establishment. For five rare Florida scrub species with different seed sizes (Liatris ohlingerae, Eryngium cuneifolium, Polygonella basiramia, Hypericum cumulicola, Paronychia chartacea subsp. chartacea), we conducted a seed removal experiment with seeds exposed to insects and vertebrates, and to insects only, with a no-access control. We also planted seeds in replicated degraded and intact scrub sites (Spring Field Trial: in bare sand, Winter Field Trial: in bare sand, litter only, and under shrubs with litter), and determined background germination rates in a growth chamber. The contrasting pattern in seed removal among treatments suggested that habitat and seed size affect the likelihood of removal in Florida scrub. Species with large seeds such as L. ohlingerae were removed in higher frequency, in degraded scrub, likely by vertebrates. Species with small seeds such as H. cumulicola and P. chartacea were removed by invertebrates and in higher frequency in intact scrub. E. cuneifolium had significantly more seedlings in degraded scrub and P. chartacea had significantly more germination in the intact scrub in the Spring Field Trial. E. cuneifolium, H. cumulicola and P. chartacea had higher germination in bare sand than in litter only or under shrubs. Our data indicate that scrub herbs are differentially vulnerable at particular life history stages and that this vulnerability can be context dependent. Restoration success will require a careful assessment of potential seed predators and abiotic conditions favoring germination and survival of study species in degraded habitat; efforts to increase heterogeneity in areas slated for restoration will likely promote the establishment of multiple targeted species.

Oxygen metabolism and water mass mixing in the northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone in 2010	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We evaluated O-2 metabolism and mixing of river and seawater in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOMEX) in May and August of 2010. A strong correlation between the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of water and salinity indicated simple mixing of the two water sources. The isotope values for the freshwater source suggested that Mississippi River water predominated over the Atchafalaya River water in at our study sites in both May and August. Knowledge of the delta O-18 of water is required for determination of the ratio of primary production to respiration (P:R) from the delta O-18 and concentration of O-2. We observed a strong correlation between delta O-18 of water and salinity, which indicates that subsequent studies of P:R may simply be able to predict the isotopic composition of water from salinity in this region. P:R values were determined from the concentration and isotopic composition of O-2 and varied from 0.88 to 1.10. The range in P:R and progression from high values in May to net heterotrophy in August is consistent with enhanced primary production in spring followed by respiration in excess of production in summer. Averages of 5.8 parts per thousand and 3.4 parts per thousand were observed for the isotopic enrichment factor, epsilon(obs), for sub-pycnocline respiration in May and August, respectively. In contrast to previous studies we found that epsilon(obs) is not an effective indicator of the proportion of water column to sediment respiration, but rather reflects the total rate of sub-pycnocline respiration (water column plus sediment respiration). Nonetheless, as epsilon(obs) is an indication of total sub-pycnocline respiration insight into oxygen-removal can be obtained without the need for incubation. Even though our research cruises occurred approximately three weeks after the initiation and one month after cessation of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, P:R and epsilon(obs) values were each within ranges reported previously in NGOMEX. Thus, a direct link between the oil spill and O-2 metabolism or hypoxia development was not apparent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lakes ranged from 0.5 to 2300 ha with less than 3 m mean depth, while the trophic state varied from mesotrophy to hypertrophy. We fished during summer 2000 and 2001, and for one lake also during spring 2002. Almost no piscivores species were recorded and in general omnivorous species dominated independently of lake trophic state. Fish dietary differences were found among lakes and prey availabilities. Maximum fish biomass and diversity were found in the Albufera lake, where mugilids (Mugil cephalus and Liza aurata) and Cyprinus carpio dominated. The other lakes had young populations of Atherina boyeri and Liza ramada, endemic species (Barbus guiraonis, Aphanius iberus) or introduced species (Lepomis gibbosus, Micropterus salmoides, Gambusia holbrooki). Fish were mainly detritivorous and shifted to zooplanktivorous depending on abundance of large zooplankton. Fish demographic changes and facultative preys influenced food webs of the lakes by both direct predation and indirect nutrient recycling from the sediment. Omnivorous structure of fish communities in these Mediterranean warmer lakes resembles that described in some food webs of tropical lakes. Bottom-up mechanisms seem to be more relevant in warmer lakes and submerged plants were special key factors to maintain clear waters in the study lakes.

Stream corridor and upland sources of fluvial sediment and phosphorus from a mixed urban-agricultural tributary to the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Like many impaired Great Lakes tributaries, Apple Creek, Wisconsin (119 km2) has Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) targets for reducing suspended sediment and total phosphorus by 51.2 % and 64.2 %, respec-tively. From August 2017 -October 2018, a stream sediment budget and fingerprinting integrated study was conducted to quantify upland and stream corridor sources of suspended sediment and sediment -bound phosphorus. Phosphorus concentrations varied among source groups and fluvial sediments, with higher concentrations among suspended sediment and cropland soils. Eroding streambanks identified in the stream corridor sediment budget accounted for 100 % of the TMDL Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) suspended sediment load but only 20 % of the total phosphorus load. Fine-grained streambed sediment equated to approximately-three years of modeled suspended sediment load but only one third of total phosphorus load. The two primary sources of fine-grained streambed sediment were streambanks and cropland, with relative streambank contributions increasing with downstream direction and water-shed area. The relative proportion of suspended sediment varied by season and streamflow; however, cropland and streambank erosion accounted for 54 % and 23 % of the suspended sediment when weighted by of the proportion for representative streamflow. Urban land was a source in the upper watershed, but the signature was sequestered by a mid-watershed detention basin. Contributions from construction sites were higher in the fall 2018, likely corresponding to increased activity following a wet spring.

J	Abdelouaheb, T; Boualem, R				Abdelouaheb, Toumi; Boualem, Remini			The Problem of Water Leakage in Beni Haroun Reservoir (Algeria)	JORDAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												During the last 25 years, Algeria witnessed an intensified drought. Thus, to meet the growing demand for water, especially in peak hours and hot weathers (summer season), more than sixty (60) large water storage dams have been founded to overcome the problem. They help collect a considerable amount of surface water falling in their watersheds. Unfortunately, it has been noticed that these structures are exposed to some hydraulic problems, such as: silting, evaporation, water pollution and water leakage. This latter threatens both the stability of the hydraulic infrastructures and the quality and quantity of the stored water. This study examines the phenomenon of water leakage at Beni Haroun dam. It is based on the measurements performed on leakage flow, hydraulic head and water level in the lake. The study aims at suggesting ways to protect the dam from the consequences of the threats mentioned earlier. Then, before being too late, it provides the consolidation work needed to be undertaken. In this respect, findings obtained potentially revealed that, over time, the flow of water leakage increases as same as the elevation of water level in the lake of the dam. On the one hand, it is found that the current lines on the right side of the groundwater, located downstream of the dike, headed to the opposite direction of the expected flow (upstream) and then moved downstream. In addition, the same magnitude has been observed on the pressure regardless of the water level. On the other hand, however, those on the left side vary according to the hydrostatic charge created by the lake and are generally directed downstream of the dike. The recorded pressure at this bank is low. This justifies the appearance of resurgences which minimize the under-pressure downstream near the dike.																			1993-0461	2225-157X					2018	12	3					402	423																WOS:000436402200005
J	Hellmann, F; Vermaat, JE				Hellmann, Fritz; Vermaat, Jan E.			Impact of climate change on water management in Dutch peat polders	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Similar displacement of perennial grasslands by shrubs typifies desertification in many regions. Such structural vegetation change could alter average values of net primary productivity, as well as spatial and temporal patterns of production. We investigated patterns of aboveground plant biomass and net primary production in five ecosystem types of the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. Comparisons of shrub-dominated desertified systems and remnant grass-dominated systems allowed us to test the prediction that shrublands are more heterogeneous spatially, but less variable over time, than grasslands. We measured aboveground plant biomass and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) by species, three times per year for 10 years, in 15 sites of five ecosystem types (three each in Larrea shrubland, Bouteloua eriopoda grassland, Prosopis dune systems, Flourensia cernua alluvial flats, and grass-dominated dry lakes or playas). Spatial heterogeneity of biomass at the scale of our measurements was significantly greater in shrub-dominated systems than in grass-dominated vegetation. ANPP was homogeneous across space in grass-dominated systems, and in most growing seasons was significantly more patchy in shrub vegetation. Substantial interannual variability in ANPP complicates comparison of mean values across ecosystem types, but grasslands tended to support higher ANPP values than did shrub-dominated systems. There were significant interactions between ecosystem type and season. Grasslands demonstrated higher interannual variation than did shrub systems. Desertification has apparently altered the seasonality of productivity in these systems; grasslands were dominated by summer growth, while sites dominated by Larrea or Prosopis tended to have higher spring ANPP. Production was frequently uncorrelated across sites of an ecosystem type, suggesting that factors other than season, regional climate, or dominant vegetation may be significant determinants of actual NPP.

J	Horgan, MJ; Mills, EL				Horgan, MJ; Mills, EL			Zebra mussel filter feeding and food-limited production of Daphnia:: recent changes in lower trophic level dynamics of Oneida Lake, New York, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Exotic zebra mussels can alter lower trophic level dynamics in lakes that they colonize by consuming large quantities of phytoplankton. We simulated the indirect effects of zebra mussel grazing on Daphnia by artificially reducing phytoplankton concentration for in situ Daphnia reproduction experiments. The response of Daphnia reproduction to reduced phytoplankton was evaluated for both the in situ experiments and field observations in Oneida Lake, New York, U.S.A. Oneida Lake has had an abundant population of zebra mussels since 1992. Our experiments revealed that fecundity of individuals from two species of Daphnia was positively related to phytoplankton concentration during the spring clearwater phase, although there was no discernible effect of food concentration on fecundity in summer cyanobacteria-dominated assemblages. The experimental results suggest that Daphnia fecundity responds to chlorophyll a concentrations < 2 mu g l(-1). The years since zebra mussels became abundant in Oneida Lake have been characterized by high water clarity, low chlorophyll concentrations, long clearwater phases, and low Daphnia biomass compared with the previous 17 years. The food web effects of zebra mussel grazing are complex and it will take more years for impacts at higher trophic levels to develop and be identified.																			0018-8158						1999	411						79	88		10.1023/A:1003877013112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003877013112													WOS:000084893200010

The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is mainly dependent on Carex in the lower and middle Yangtze River floodplain. Exploring the relationship between the growth conditions of Carex and the foraging strategies adopted by wintering greater white-fronted geese has important ecological implications for habitat protection and management. In this study, scan sampling and focal animal sampling were used to record the foraging behaviors of greater white-fronted geese wintering at Shengjin Lake, and the plant height and water content of Carex were surveyed simultaneously. The relationship between plant characteristics and foraging behaviors was tested using a linear regression equation. The results showed that Carex had two growth periods at Shengjin Lake, and the pecking rate and foraging time budget of greater white-fronted geese were higher during these two periods. Plant characteristics were positively correlated with goose foraging behaviors. The strategic adjustment of the foraging behaviors adopted by wintering greater white-fronted geese was consistent with the growth stage of Carex, which is the optimal foraging window for greater white-fronted geese. During the foraging windows, geese changed their foraging strategies to obtain more energy in order to guarantee successful wintering and migration.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	Cheng, Lei/0009-0004-2755-0413; 														1424-2818				NOV	2022	14	11							943	10.3390/d14110943	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14110943													WOS:000883420900001

In-Season Application of Nitrogen and Sulfur in Winter Wheat	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Decreased atmospheric S deposition in the past 20 yr has led to increased S fertilizer consumption in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Producers often apply S without any soil test information. Experiments were conducted at Lahoma, Lake Carl Blackwell, and Perkins, OK (2011-2013) to assess the effect of N and S applied preplant and foliar on grain yield and grain N for winter wheat. In 2011-2012, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) was applied preplant at rates of 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1) additionally; UAN and urea-triazone (NSURE) were foliar-applied at rates of 10 and 20 kg N ha(-1). Sulfur was foliar-applied as gypsum (CaSO(4)2H O-2) at 6 kg S ha(-1). In 2013, trials were altered to apply 40 kg N ha(-1) as UAN preplant, and 20 kg N ha(-1) foliar-applied. Gypsum rates were adjusted at 0, 3, and 6 kg S ha(-1) preplant, and S (MAX-IN-S) at 3 and 6 kg S ha(-1) was foliar-applied. Sulfur did not increase grain yield or grain N concentration at any site. The interaction between foliar S and N and preplant S and N was not significant. Sulfur fertilizer application is less likely to benefit this region unless low levels of soil test S are identified before planting. Use of recommended soiltesting guides are encouraged. Although S applications are encouraged commercially, no response was observed in these trials, and all were on sites where soil organic carbon was low (<8.5 g kg(-1)), where the possibility of seeing S deficiency was greater.

The association between climate teleconnection indices and Upper Klamath seasonal streamflow: Trans-Nino Index	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					General Assembly of the European-Geosciences-Union	APR 02-07, 2006	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				This research investigates large-scale climate features affecting inter-annual hydrologic variability of streams flowing into Upper Klamath Lake (UKL), Oregon, USA. UKL. is an arid, mountainous basin located in the rain shadow east of the crest of the Cascade Mountains in the northwestern United States. Developing accurate statistical models for predicting spring and summer seasonal streamflow volumes for UKL. is difficult because the basin has complex hydrology and a high degree of topographic and climatologic variability. In all effort to reduce streamflow forecast uncertainty, six large-scale climate indices-the Pacific North American Pattern, Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index, Nino 3.4, and a revised Trans-Nino Index (TNI)-were evaluated for their ability to explain inter-annual variation of the major hydrologic inputs into UKL. The TNI is the only index to show significant correlations during the current warm phase of the PDO. During the wand PDO phase (1978-present), the averaged October through December TNI is strongly correlated with the subsequent April through September streamflow (r = 0.7) and 1 April snow water equivalent (r = 0.6,). Regional analysis shows that this climate signal is not limited to UKL but is found throughout the northwestern United States. Incorporating the TNI variable into statistical streamflow prediction models results in standard errors of forecasts issued on the first of February and earlier that are 7-10% smaller than those for the models without the TNI. This, coupled with other enhancements to the statistical models, offers a significant increment of improvement in forecasts used by water managers.

Griff. in River Nile ecosystem: implication for phytoremediation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The present study aimed at investigating (1) the seasonal concentrations of heavy metals in different organs of Vossia cuspidata (Roxb.) Griff. in its main natural habitats in the River Nile ecosystem in Cairo, Egypt, (2) the bioaccumulation and translocation of heavy metals in the organs of V. cuspidata and its potentials as a phytostabilizer, and (3) the seasonal changes in the dry matter (DM) biomass of the organs. Two river islands were selected for seasonal sampling of water, sediment, and plant organs in eighteen randomly distributed quadrates (0.5 x 0.5 m each) during the period from February 2018 to January 2019. The total annual mean DM biomass was approximate to 18.7 ton ha(-1). The aboveground organs had significant seasonal variations in DM biomass (p < 0.05). The belowground DM biomass represents 23% of the aboveground DM biomass. Belowground organs had the highest DM biomass values in winter for the roots (23.85 g DM m(-2), 4.75% from the total DM) and spring for the rhizomes (108.96 g DM m(-2), 37.3% from the total DM). Regardless of the heavy metals concentrations in water and sediment, V. cuspidata can accumulate Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb at high levels. There was a statistically significant interaction between the effects of seasons and organs on the concentrations of Mn, Ni, and Pb at p < 0.001. The root was the main accumulating organ for the analyzed elements in the present study. Vossia cuspidata can transfer low concentrations of the analyzed metals from belowground to aboveground organs. We recommend V. cuspidata as a potential phytostabilizer to Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Pb from the mainstream of River Nile.					; Fahmy, Gamal/KLZ-8145-2024; Farahat, Emad/S-6259-2019; Mahmoud, Waleed/AFI-8312-2022	Farahat, Emad/0000-0003-3115-1912; Fahmy, Gamal/0000-0002-9245-9972													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2021	28	25					32626	32633		10.1007/s11356-021-13033-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13033-2		FEB 2021						33629164					WOS:000621305000003

Late Quaternary environmental change in the interior South American tropics: new insight from leaf wax stable isotopes	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Stable isotope analysis of leaf waxes in a sediment core from Laguna La Gaiba, a shallow lake located at the Bolivian margin of the Pantanal wetlands, provides new perspective on vegetation and climate change in the lowland interior tropics of South America over the past 40,000 years. The carbon isotopic compositions (delta C-13) of long-chain n-alkanes reveal large shifts between C-3- and C-4-dominated vegetation communities since the last glacial period, consistent with landscape reconstructions generated with pollen data from the same sediment core. Leaf wax delta C-13 values during the last glacial period reflect an open landscape composed of C-4 grasses and C-3 herbs from 41-20 ka. A peak in C-4 abundance during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 21 ka) suggests drier or more seasonal conditions relative to the earlier glacial period, while the development of a C-3-dominated forest community after 20 ka points to increased humidity during the last deglaciation. Within the Holocene, large changes in the abundance of C-4 vegetation indicate a transition from drier or more seasonal conditions during the early/mid-Holocene to wetter conditions in the late Holocene coincident with increasing austral summer insolation. Strong negative correlations between leaf wax delta C-13 and delta D values over the entire record indicate that the majority of variability in leaf wax delta D at this site can be explained by variability in the magnitude of biosynthetic fractionation by different vegetation types rather than changes in meteoric water delta D signatures. However, positive delta D deviations from the observed delta C-13-delta D trends are consistent with more enriched source water and drier or more seasonal conditions during the early/mid-Holocene and LGM. Overall, our record adds to evidence of varying influence of glacial boundary conditions and orbital forcing on South American Summer Monsoon precipitation in different regions of the South American tropics. Moreover, the relationships between leaf wax stable isotopes and pollen data observed at this site underscore the complementary nature of pollen and leaf wax delta C-13 data for reconstructing past vegetation changes and the potentially large effects of such changes on leaf wax delta D signatures.

J	Frumkin, A; Raz, E				Frumkin, A; Raz, E			Collapse and subsidence associated with salt karstification along the dead sea	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Two types of sinkholes are observed along the Dead Seashore, Israel. The first is associated with vadose dissolution in Mount Sedom salt diapir. The second is associated with dissolution under the watertable along the retreating Dead Sea shore. The Dead Sea level is falling dramatically, mainly because of human activity. Simultaneously, the take shores suffer tremendous impact since the late 1980s: The ground is collapsing and subsiding in hundreds of points along the take, with people, roads and property being swallowed in the more catastrophic events. The collapse is believed to result from dissolution of salt by aggressive groundwater, following the retreat of Dead Sea level and the groundwater halocline. Geological evidence suggests that a previous major lake level fall occurred naturallysimilar to2000 BCE. This may provide a new explanation for a curious historical-geological phrase in the book of Genesis, suggested to record formation of collapse sinkholes which occurred in response to the historic falling take level, associated with climatic desiccation.

Microcystins, nutrient dynamics, and other environmental factors during blooms of non-microcystin-producing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, 2009	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Seasonal phytoplankton blooms dominated by cyanobacteria in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, produce toxic microcystins at concentrations that may be detrimental to local wildlife. In 2009, water column, sediment trap, and surficial sediment samples were collected to relate the occurrences of microcystins in these samples to other environmental variables. Microcystin concentrations in sediment trap and surficial sediment samples were lower than in water column samples, and sediment trap samples contained higher concentrations than surficial sediment samples, with a peak in one sample (1107g/g) that exceeded the maximum concentration measured in any other water or sediment sample from this area. Concentrations of microcystins and cells of Microcystis aeruginosa increased following the decline of the first bloom dominated by non-microcystin-producing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in response to an increase in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Results of this study also show that nitrogen fixation by A. flos-aquae during spring and early summer provided nitrogen for growth of toxigenic M. aeruginosa and that phosphorus availability may have played a greater role overall in determining the pattern of microcystin occurrence in the lake, given the apparent influence of phosphorus on growth and decline of the A. flos-aquae bloom. This study is the first report of microcystins in sediments of Upper Klamath Lake, the largest lake (by surface area) in Oregon, and contributes to understanding the conditions under which elevated microcystin concentrations occur.

The valley walls consist of Mesozoic limestone and Quaternary volcanic rocks, overlain by thick lacustrine deposits. Prior to dam construction, a few sinkholes were observed in the reservoir area, but after impoundment, several new sinkholes formed and leakage occurred through downstream springs. Despite extensive treatment works, the reservoir has currently impounded only 40% of its designed capacity, about 35 years after the commencement of operations. The Lar Reservoir is located inside the area of a large palaeo-lake, which formed as a result of blockage of the river valley by eruption of the Damavand Volcano during the Pleistocene. This lake existed for thousands of years, developing deep karst conduits in the limestone below the volcanic rocks toward downstream springs. With the construction of the Lar Reservoir, relict karst conduits were revived and leakage occurred. Two paths are proposed for reservoir leakage, considering the region's historical geology, present hydrogeological setting, tracer tests and isotopic studies, as well as the response of spring discharge and borehole water level to reservoir filling.																			1470-9236					NOV	2017	50	4					444	453		10.1144/qjegh2017-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/qjegh2017-016													WOS:000429071200010

However, knowledge of these processes are largely confined to ice-free seasons. Recent research under ice has mainly focused on the water eco-environmental effects during winter. Sediment N accumulation during the ice-on season and its associated eco-environmental impacts have never been systematically investigated. To address these knowledge gaps, we chose Wuliangsu Lake in China as a case study site, taking advantage of the spatial disparity between the 13 semi-separated sub-lakes. Based on samples of 35 sampling sites collected before, in the middle, and at the end of ice-on season separately, we performed a quantitative analysis of under-ice lake N accumulation and water-sediment N exchange by analyzing N fraction variations. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Relevance Analysis were used to help elucidate the main causes and implications of under-ice N variation. Our results clearly show that existing studies have underestimated the impact of under-ice N accumulation on the lake ecology throughout year: 1) Sediment N accumulated 23 times more than that before winter; 2) residual nitrogen (Res-N) contributed to the majority of the accumulated sediment N and was mainly induced by the debris of macrophytes; 3) total available nitrogen (TAN) was the most easily exchanged fractions between sediment and water, and it mainly affected the water environment during winter; 4) the Res-N accumulation during the ice-on season may have a strong impact on the eco-environment in the subsequent seasons. Our research is valuable for understanding the mechanism of internal nutrient cycle and controlling the internal nitrogen pollution, especially in shallow seasonally-frozen lakes that have long suffered from macrophyte-phytoplankton co-dominated eutrophication.

J	Brugger, KA; Laabs, B; Reimers, A; Bensen, N				Brugger, Keith A.; Laabs, Benjamin; Reimers, Alexander; Bensen, Noah			Late Pleistocene glaciation in the Mosquito Range, Colorado, USA: chronology and climate	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												New cosmogenic Be-10 surface exposure ages from 17 moraine boulders in the Mosquito Range of Colorado suggest that glaciers were at their late Pleistocene (Pinedale) maximum extent at similar to 21-20 ka, and that ice recession commenced before similar to 17 ka. These age limits suggest that the Pinedale Glaciation was synchronous within the Colorado Rocky Mountain region. Locally, the previous (Bull Lake) glaciation appears to have occurred no later than 117 ka, possibly similar to 130 ka allowing for reasonable rock weathering rates. Temperature-index modeling is used to determine the magnitude of temperature depression required to maintain steady-state mass balances of seven reconstructed glaciers at their maximum extent. Assuming no significant differences in precipitation compared to modern values, mean annual temperatures were similar to 8.1 and 7.5 degrees C lower, respectively, on the eastern and western slopes of the range with quantifiable uncertainties of + 0.8/-0.9 degrees C. If an average temperature depression of 7.8 degrees C is assumed for the entire range, precipitation differences - that today are 15-30% greater on the eastern slope due to the influence of winter/early spring snowfall - might have been enhanced. The temperature depressions inferred here are consistent with similarly derived values elsewhere in the Colorado Rockies and those inferred from regional-scale climate modeling.																			0267-8179	1099-1417				APR	2019	34	3					187	202		10.1002/jqs.3090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3090													WOS:000470792300002

Ammonium and phosphate excretion rates and lipid content were examined in P. hoyi under the following conditions: (1) field animals sampled seasonally, (2) food-deprived animals in filtered lake water, and (3) control animals held in native sediments without new food inputs. Nutrient excretion rates for P. hoyi (0.5 to 2 nmole NH4 (milligrams dry weight)-1 .cntdot. h-1 and 0 to 0.15 nmole PO4 (milligrams dry weight)-1 .cntdot. h-1) were low relative to rates previously reported for other benthic and pelagic invertebrates and varied little among the three treatment groups. In contrast to the animals held in the laboratory without new food inputs, field-collected P. hoyi accumulated increased levels of lipids following the spring diatom bloom. However, after lipid levels in field animals peaked in May, they decreased during the rest of the season at rates similar to those of starved and control animals. P. hoyi''s low nutrient-excretion rates, and its ability to accumulate and store energy as lipids, for periods when food is not abundant, appear to be important factors allowing this animal to thrive in temperate lakes with spring diatom blooms.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1989	46	7					1125	1130		10.1139/f89-146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-146													WOS:A1989AD52000007

Climate models and proxy records show that the eruption may have caused cooling of the Asian landmass, thus impacting regional climate such as the Indian monsoon system. However, the immediate effect of the eruption on the Indian monsoon has not been indisputably demonstrated in any proxy record. Here, we present a paleo-primary productivity (PP) record in core SO130-289KL from the northeastern Arabian Sea based on the coccolithophore species Florisphaera profunda transfer function. Florisphaera profunda decreased from similar to 30% before the YTT eruption to similar to 8% right after the YTT eruption, which translates to an increase in PP by similar to 65% from a long-term average of similar to 200 gC/m(2)/yr for about 8-19 years after the eruption. The duration was estimated using a new error-weighted mean age of the YTT eruption (73.9 +/- 0.1 ka, 2 sigma uncertainties) based on recent age estimates from ice cores, radiometric dating, and speleothem records. The elevated PP is most likely linked to the deepening of the surface ocean mixed layer driven by strengthened northeasterly Indian winter monsoon winds. This hypothesis is supported by stable oxygen isotope records from speleothem and ice cores, which show indications of a strengthening of the Indian winter monsoon during times of increased PP. Our results support previous modeling studies and provide unequivocal evidence from a marine record for an Indian monsoon response to the supereruption.

The concentration of nuclides within the U and Th decay series range over several orders of magnitude. The acid groundwaters display very high Ac, Ra, Rn-222, Pb-210 and Po-210 activities in the springs on the western margin of the lake compared to those generally recorded in less saline and neutral groundwaters. This is an area of the lake margin where Ra-226 and Ra-228 have accumulated in shallow sediments. Measured and estimated distribution coefficients for Ra-226 range from 10 to 800, which combined with flow rates places the source of the Ra-226 within 5 km of the radioactive spring zone. Ac-227 showed the strongest control by pH of all the measured radionuclides and was similar to Al in this behaviour. Pb-210 and Po-210 appear to be quite mobile at high salinity when pH was < 5. U and Th concentrations were not generally very high in any combination of acid/saline waters except for elevated Th-228 activities in the spring waters. These probably relate to high concentrations of its parent Ra-228 in the waters.

J	Zvelebil, M				Zvelebil, Marek			Mobility, contact, and exchange in the Baltic Sea basin 6000-2000 BC	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												My intention in this paper is to outline the main features and principal aspects of contact and exchange among the later prehistoric hunter-gatherers (late Mesolithic and post-Mesolithic) in the Baltic Sea basin, which covers the southern and eastern reaches of Northern Europe, and to summarise the main advances in current research. The area broadly covered includes the Baltic Sea basin that has provided effective routes for communication between the coastal regions surrounding the Baltic Sea, central Baltic islands, and regions further away in the north European Plain, inland regions of Fennoscandia and Russia that could be reached by an extensive network of major rivers and lakes, Effective transport for negotiating these routes both in the summer and winter existed already from the early Mesolithic. Goods moved along these routes included a wide range of artefacts discussed in the paper. Geographically, exchange was organised at three levels: regionally, inter-regionally, and over long distances. Each mode of exchange was probably organised along different lines socially, and each served to implement wide-ranging social strategies for the general purposes of social reproduction, mate exchange and biological reproduction, as well as the spread of innovations. In the concluding section, I discuss the nature of contacts and consequences of exchanges between the early farming communities and the hunter-gathering groups within the framework of the core-periphery relations.

J	Zou, JY; Song, ZF; Yamin, D				Zou, Junyu; Song, Zefeng; Yamin, Duan			Water-source contributions to barrier lakes and water-rock interactions in the Wudalianchi volcanic area, Northeast China	WATER SUPPLY												Wudalianchi is a typical continental Cenozoic volcanic group rich in potassic volcanic rocks (Northeast China). Five hydrologically connected barrier lakes (Lakes 5 to 1) and upwelling cold mineral springs occur, forming a complex lake-groundwater system. Clarifying the water-source contributions and the role of water-rock interactions in the hydrological cycling for barrier lakes remains a challenge from scientific and engineering perspectives. In this study, seasonal variations of multiple isotopes were analyzed. delta O-18 and delta D data indicate that the Wudalianchi lakes were mainly fed by mineral springs. The values, however, were greatly influenced by precipitation (rain and snow) and varying evaporation intensities. In contrast, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios varied little between seasons (0.70701-0.7079), suggesting similar water-rock interactions through time. Nonetheless, Sr isotopic mixing models suggested that shallow mineral springs generally contributed >50% of the water to lower reaches. In contrast, the upstream wetland contributed >50% to Lake 5 and decreased down-valley (10.3-53.6%). Calculations based on the delta O-18 and delta D Rayleigh fractionation equation suggest that evaporation in upper reaches were higher than the lower reaches. The evaporation in July were generally higher than in October. This study demonstrates the homogenous water-rock interactions and the associated water mixing effects on the terrestrial volcanic area.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				DEC	2021	21	8					4276	4286		10.2166/ws.2021.177	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.177		JUN 2021											WOS:000660605800001
J	Gibson, JJ				Gibson, JJ			Short-term evaporation and water budget comparisons in shallow Arctic lakes using non-steady isotope mass balance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Shallow lakes in a continental. low Arctic setting are found to undergo substantial fluctuations in heavy-isotope content during the annual cycle due to extreme seasonality in water balance processes. Progressive isotope enrichment during the ice-free period occurs as a consequence of isotope exchange during evaporation under seasonally arid conditions, while enhanced input and flushing by heavy-isotope depleted precipitation and snowmelt during late fall and spring tend to deplete the lakes in heavy isotopes once again. Time-series sampling surveys in a group of nearby lakes, ranging in volume from 41,000 to 2,250,000 m(3), was carried out for two consecutive ice-free periods, in conjunction with a comprehensive hydrological measurement program in a detailed study lake, to assess models that describe isotopic enrichment in lakes and to test their suitability for comparing evaporation rates and water balance. From a non-steady isotope balance analysis, it is found that isotope enrichment rates in lakes during the ice-free period are determined primarily by evaporation rates and volume of the lakes, and are less sensitive to water balance variations for short time intervals when evaporation is less than 50 mm or so. A basic assessment of best-fit and step-wise models is presented which suggests that the former are useful only for predicting evaporation and water balance during month-long periods with relatively stable atmospheric and hydrologic conditions. A step-wise isotope balance approach is presented which demonstrates how isotope-based estimates of evaporation rates can be applied to effectively compare short-term (weekly) water balance in nearby lakes. Practical applications in the region include water balance assessments to assist in design and maintenance of tailings ponds for gold and diamond mining operations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fossilised geothermal surface features of the Whitianga Volcanic Centre (Miocene), Coromandel Volcanic Zone, New Zealand: Controls and characteristics	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Late Miocene Whitianga Volcanic Centre of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand, is host to 18 known, siliceous and intensely silicified deposits including: silicified volcanics; sediments of inferred lacustrine, fluvial and mud pool origin; siliceous hot spring deposits, or sinters; and silicic veins. Collectively these siliceous and silicified deposits indicate past geothermal activity that occurred at the Earth's surface and in the shallow subsurface. Sinters, in particular, are of interest because they are derived from deep geothermal reservoirs and precipitate from discharged thermal fluids at the intersection of the water table with the land surface. However, some siliceous and silicified features in hydrothermal paleoenvironments have been misidentified as sinters. By studying textural types, distributions, structural setting, mineral paragenesis and trace elemental composition of the siliceous and silicified deposits in the Whitianga Volcanic Centre, it is possible to differentiate sinters and identify their spring-vent source areas (100-70 degrees C) from more distal thermal spring discharge locations (<70 degrees C to ambient), extent of hydrothermal alteration, and, in places, delineate zones of epithermal upflow where Au-Ag mineralisation may have occurred at depth. This has important implications for the exploration of mineralised epithermal ore deposits at local to regional scales, in particular for the Hauraki Goldfield of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone.

The studies were carried out after limiting the water flow in the pipeline from 0.25 m(3)-s(-1) to 0.05 m(3)-s(-1). The nutrients budget analysed in detail for the period of the pipeline operation was later compared to the theoretical budget with a surface outflow only. The maximum reduction of nutrients, and phosphorus in particular, was noted in the second half of summer stagnation when the pipeline was operating. Negative phosphorus accumulation in the summer months was the result of a balanced removal of hypolimnion water through the whole summer stagnation.

The multi-heat pump system with different heat capacities is one of the most effective ways to extract heat from data centers, which need to match the cooling and heating demand in varied times and spaces. It will improve the performance of the integrated system, however, it raises their complexity and decreases the reliability. This study developed a comprehensive model from the computer room to heat consumers, mainly including information technology (IT) equipment heat dissipation, computer room air handler (CRAH), heat exchanger, water pump, heat pump, and thermal energy storage tank (TES). Based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP), an optimization control strategy was used to save energy without sacrificing the data center's reliability by regulating key operating parameters, such as the partial load ratio (PLR) of the heat pump, the ON-OFF mode, water pump's flow rate, and the heat storage and release mode of TES. Compared to the rule-based strategy, the MILP-based strategy improved the heat pump's daily average coefficient of performance (COP) and the heating system's energysaving rate by 1.19 and 15.11 % in winter, 1.21 and 14.68 % in the transition season, 1.13 and 12.91 % in summer, respectively. The related energy consumption of the cooling system in the above three seasons decreased by 3.78 %, 3.50 %, and 3.38 %, and the annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) reduced by 0.01.

J	Malecka-Adamowicz, M; Kubera, L				Malecka-Adamowicz, Marta; Kubera, Lukasz			Patterns of Structural and Functional Bacterioplankton Metacommunity along a River under Anthropogenic Pressure	SUSTAINABILITY												Bacteria, an integral part of aquatic ecosystems, are responsible for the circulation of matter and flow of energy. Since bacterioplankton rapidly responds to any natural and human-induced disturbances in the environment, it can serve as a bioindicator of these changes. Knowing factors that shape the microbial community structure may help the sustainable management of the water environment. However, the identification of environmental signals affecting the structure and function of bacterioplankton is still a challenge. The study analyses the impact of environmental variables on basic microbial parameters, which determines the effectiveness of ecological processes in rivers. Measurements of bacterioplankton abundance (BA) and extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) were based on fluorescent markers. The bacterial community structure was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Illumina). The results indicate spatial variation in bacterioplankton abundance. Temporal variation was not significant. Lipase and aminopeptidase had the highest level of activity. EEA was not correlated with bacterial abundance but was significantly correlated with temperature. Moreover, differences in lipase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase activity levels between spring and summer were noted. At the same time, the location of sampling site had a significant influence on aminopeptidase activity. The taxonomic analysis of bacterioplankton communities in the Brda River indicated that, although different numbers of OTUs were recorded in the studied river sections, bacterioplankton biodiversity did not change significantly along the river with distance downstream. Anthropogenically modified river sections were characterized by the dominance of Flavobacterium (Bacterioidetes) and hgcl clade (Actinobacteria) taxa, known for their ability to produce extracellular enzymes. PCoA analysis revealed that the sites located in the lower river course (urban area) had the most similar bacterial community structure (beta-diversity). The study provides new insight into the changes in microbial communities along the river and emphasizes the potential impact of anthropogenization on these processes.

However, concern has been voiced about burning within or near riparian areas because of the potential effect on nutrient release and, ultimately, lake water quality. Our objective was to quantify the effects of pile burning on soil physical and chemical properties and resulting near-stream surface and subsurface water chemistry. Twenty-seven hand-built piles of three contrasting fuelbed types (large wood, mixed-diameter slash, small-diameter slash) were burned. Burn sites were located throughout the basin and included both granitic and volcanic parent materials as well as glacial out-wash. We suspected that post-fire changes in soil physical and chemical properties would ensue as maximum soil surface temperatures averaged 400 degrees C for all pile types and exceeded 200 degrees C for >30 h beneath large-wood piles. Post-fire soil water repellency was greatest for large-wood piles, yet increased for all pile types when soil moisture content fell below a threshold of 7 % to 10 % during the dry summer season. Soil bulk density increased moderately whereas water infiltration rates decreased more than fourfold after burning of large-wood piles and mixed-slash piles. Surface runoff and subsurface flow concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate were measured downslope from the piles at 6 mo and 18 mo after burning. Mean NO3, ortho-PO4, and SO4 concentrations were low (<10 mg L-1) at both sampling dates and typically declined downslope from the pile edge. The results showed that pile burning. regardless of fuel composition. had a limited effect on downslope water quality despite associated changes in soil physicochemical properties.																			1933-9747						2015	11	2					100	118		10.4996/fireecology.1102100	http://dx.doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.1102100													WOS:000360501100007

At least 50% of all marked birds were detected on Mono Lake, and data collected in mid-October suggested that this proportion was consistent across years. These observations largely confirm a fall migration pattern that had been previously based on leg-band returns. Radio-tracking also confirmed that some movement occurred between Mono Lake and Salton Sea. In terms of the number of marked birds detected, the internal antenna-type transmitter produced superior results over other (attachment) protocols but their short range (<2 km) means that they will be effective only at sites where the birds are both abundant and concentrated such as Mono Lake, Great Salt Lake. and Salton Sea.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				FAL	2000	71	4					702	707		10.1648/0273-8570-71.4.702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570-71.4.702													WOS:000166325300016

This is mostly due to nutrient-rich water released from both point and nonpoint sources. Thirteen ostracod taxa (Candona neglecta, C. candida, Ilyocypris bradyi, Darwinula stevensoni, Cypridopsis vidua, Physocypria kraepelini, Cypria ophtalmica, Prionocypris zenkeri, Eucypris virens, Herpetocypris reptans, Pseudocandona compressa, Fabaeformiscandona fabaeformis Potamocypris cf. fulva) were found during this study. Potamocypris cf. fulva is a new record for the Turkish freshwater ostracod fauna. The first nine of these species have broad geographic ranges, implying high tolerance levels to different environmental variables. Based on the estimated species optima and tolerance levels, two species exhibited higher effective number of occurrences (C. neglecta, and D. stevensoni, respectively) than the other species. Three species (C. neglecta, D. stevensoni, I. bradyi) did not show significant correlation with any environmental variable we used. Both Canonical correspondence (CCA) and Pearson correlation analyses showed that temperature was the most effective predictor of species occurrence, followed by electrical conductivity and redox potential. In contrast, pH and dissolved oxygen of water were the least effective predictors. Approximately 71% of the correlation between community composition and environmental variables was explained by the first axis of the CCA diagram, which had a relatively low (7.7%) cumulative variance of species. The lower (560 mu g/l) and the upper (2030 mu g/l) levels of ammonia (NH3) exceeded the limits during winter season. The concentrations of total coliform and Escherichia coli bacteria were measured up to 10 x 10(7) cfu/ml and 10 x 10(3) cfu/ml, respectively. Results of physicochemical measurements, microbiological counts, and species data indicate that water quality of Lake Yenicaga has been rapidly deteriorated by anthropogenic factors that are the main threat for not only the lake's aquatic diversity but also human health around the lake.

J	Zhu, YN; Ye, AZ; Zhang, YH				Zhu, Yinuo; Ye, Aizhong; Zhang, Yuhang			Water body seasonality reveals the dominant role of human activity across the Yangtze River Basin in China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water bodies play a vital part of the ecosystem services and human society. In recent decades, global water bodies have undergone drastic changes, including those in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), the densest freshwater lake group in East Asia. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive description of the pattern of the dynamic changes of these valuable water resources in the YRB. Here, we combined the most complete reservoir database and advanced water enhance algorithm to construct the time series of monthly areas of 1,632 reservoirs in the YRB from 1988 to 2020, and monitored the area changes of reservoirs, controlled lakes, and natural lakes over the past thirty years at the monthly time scale. We find that the area of reservoirs in the YRB showed an upward trend (12.4 km2/year), while natural lakes showed a downward trend (-3.6 km2/year), and the controlled lakes did not show a significant trend (2.4 km2/year). The spatial pattern of changes in the area of reservoirs and controlled lakes is that contraction is mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the YRB, and changes in the area of natural lakes exhibit a spatial pattern of expansion to contraction from upstream to downstream. The opposite intra-annual area changes patterns of natural lakes and controlled lakes have jointly formed a wshaped pattern of intra-annual changes in the total lake area in the YRB, with trend inflection points occurring in February, May, July, August, and November, respectively. Human activities reversed the seasonal area variability of 84.6 % lake, with greatest impact on reservoirs and controlled lakes in autumn and spring. The long term-series analysis of the evolution patterns and driving mechanisms of water bodies in the YRB provides a scientific basis for the reasonable allocation and sustainable use of future water resources.					; ye, aizhong/J-5339-2015; Ye, Aizhong/J-5339-2015; Zhang, Yuhang/KOC-4021-2024	Zhang, Yuhang/0000-0001-6996-0008; ye, aizhong/0000-0002-5272-134X; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2025	653								132759	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132759		JAN 2025											WOS:001422212200001

Holocene summer temperature reconstruction from sedimentary chlorophyll content, with treatment of age uncertainties, Kurupa Lake, Arctic Alaska	HOLOCENE												Quantitative records of pre-industrial temperature changes are fundamental for understanding long-term natural climate variability. We used visible reflectance spectroscopy to measure chlorophyll content (and its derivatives) in a sediment core from Kurupa Lake, north-central Brooks Range, Alaska, to reconstruct summer temperature and the number of annual non-freezing days over the past 5.7ka. A calibration-in-time approach was used to convert downcore changes in chlorophyll content to the climate variables, and an ensemble approach was used to integrate age and calibration uncertainties. The strongest correlation (r(median)=0.69, p(median)=0.02, RMSEP=1.9 degrees C) is for summer (June through September) temperature using the 20th Century Reanalysis Project dataset. The chlorophyll-inferred 3-year-mean summer temperature shows that the warmest century (3.0-2.9ka BP) was about 3.0 degrees C (90% range of the ensemble members=2.3-4.0 degrees C) higher and that the coldest century (1.4-1.3ka BP) was about 5.5 degrees C lower (90% range=-7.6 degrees C to -5.0 degrees C) than during the reference period (AD 1961-1990). Century-to-century temperature changes over the past 5.7ka at Kurupa Lake have been large (90% range=-2.8 degrees C to 3.1 degrees C shifts in centennial mean), including the shift between the 19th and 20th centuries, which was above the 90th percentile of temperature changes across all representations of the reconstruction. In contrast to most Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions, Kurupa Lake shows no overall millennial-scale cooling trend. We suggest that increased summer duration (by 4.3days during the last 6ka) along with no long-term increase in sea-ice cover over the adjacent Chukchi Sea counter-balanced the influence of decreased insolation intensity on the aquatic productivity in Kurupa Lake.

Temporal variation in phytoplankton beta diversity patterns and metacommunity structures across subtropical reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Analysing the beta diversity components and spatial patterns of species distribution may provide key insights into how local communities respond to human-induced environmental changes. Indeed, analysing temporal variation in spatial patterns of species distribution may reveal trends of biotic homogenisation and its likely causes. 2. We used an eight-year phytoplankton data set generated from to 17 reservoirs in Brazil to analyse the temporal variability in beta diversity and its turnover and nestedness components. This data set was also used to determine metacommunity structures across these subtropical reservoirs. We tested whether there was any long-term temporal trend in beta diversity that might be indicative of biotic homogenisation or differentiation. We also tested how temporal variation was related to climatic conditions, environmental heterogeneity, productivity and cyanobacterial dominance. Lastly, we verified whether the phytoplankton metacommunity showed non-random structure. 3. We did not find supporting evidence for biotic homogenisation among the reservoirs. Rather, we did find that nestedness decreased during the study. Environmental heterogeneity was the main variable positively related to phytoplankton beta diversity, while high ammonium concentration and cyanobacterial abundance were negatively correlated with spatial variation among the reservoirs. Despite the noticeable temporal variation in metacommunity structures, the phytoplankton species responded similar to latent environmental gradients. Clementsian patterns found mainly in fall and winter were consistent with differences in species composition between sites, reinforcing the role of environmental filtering in driving changes in these metacommunities. 4. Our results suggest that eutrophication control is essential to prevent biotic homogenisation, at least in our study system. We also highlight that metacommunity patterns detected in snapshot surveys should not be extrapolated temporally.					; Bini, Luis Mauricio/D-5865-2013; Bini, Luis/D-5865-2013; Padial, Andre/H-8977-2012; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010	Wojciechowski, Juliana/0000-0002-8841-8342; Bini, Luis Mauricio/0000-0003-3398-9399; Padial, Andre/0000-0002-8766-5974; Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2017	62	4					751	766		10.1111/fwb.12899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12899													WOS:000397947100009

Holocene temperature history of northwest Greenland - With new ice cap constraints and chironomid assemblages from Deltaso	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Arctic temperature shifts drive changes in carbon cycling, sea ice extent and Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance, all of which have global ramifications. Paleoclimate data from past warm periods provide a unique means for assessing the sensitivity of these systems to warming climate, but the magnitude and timing of past temperature changes in many parts of the Arctic are poorly known. Here we assess orbital scale Holocene temperature change in northwest Greenland near the margin of the ice sheet using subfossil insect assemblages from lake Deltaso. Based upon sedimentation history in this currently proglacial lake, we also place constraints on Holocene extents of the adjacent North Ice Cap, a large independent ice cap. Reconstructed summer temperatures were warmer than present at the onset of lacustrine sedimentation following regional deglaciation by the Greenland Ice Sheet, sometime between 10.8 and 10.1 ka BP. Deltaso experienced the warmest summer temperatures of the Holocene between similar to 10 and 6.2 ka BP, followed by progressive cooling that continued through the late Holocene as summer insolation declined, culminating in the lowest temperatures during the pre-industrial last millennium. Deltaso chironomids indicate peak early Holocene summer temperatures at least 2.5-3 degrees C warmer than modern and at least 3.5-4 degrees C warmer than the pre-industrial last millennium. We infer based upon lake sediment organic and biogenic content that in response to declining temperatures, North Ice Cap reached its present-day size similar to 1850 AD, having been smaller than present through most of the preceding Holocene. Our synthesis of paleoclimate evidence from northwest Greenland, Ellesmere Island and northern Baffin Bay supports the timing of temperature trends inferred at Deltaso, and suggests that quantitative temperature reconstructions from Deltas(?) may represent a minimum bound on regional early Holocene warming. Collectively, records from the region indicate >4 degrees C summer cooling through the Holocene. Intense early Holocene warmth around northwest Greenland argues against delayed onset of warmer than -present conditions due to the influence of the nearby waning Laurentide Ice Sheet, and has implications for understanding the Greenland Ice Sheet's sensitivity to climate change.

Consequently, lake ice has been included among the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and there is a need to set up operational monitoring capabilities. Multi-temporal satellite images and publicly available webcam streams are among the viable data sources capable of monitoring lake ice. In this work we investigate machine learning-based image analysis as a tool to determine the spatio-temporal extent of ice on Swiss Alpine lakes as well as the ice-on and ice-off dates, from both multispectral optical satellite images (VIIRS and MODIS) and RGB webcam images. We model lake ice monitoring as a pixel-wise semantic segmentation problem, i.e., each pixel on the lake surface is classified to obtain a spatially explicit map of ice cover. We show experimentally that the proposed system produces consistently good results when tested on data from multiple winters and lakes. Our satellite-based method obtains mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores > 93%, for both sensors. It also generalises well across lakes and winters with mIoU scores > 78% and >80% respectively. On average, our webcam approach achieves mIoU values of approximate to 87% and generalisation scores of approximate to 71% and approximate to 69% across different cameras and winters respectively. Additionally, we generate and make available a new benchmark dataset of webcam images (Photi-LakeIce) which includes data from two winters and three cameras.					; Tom, Manu/ABV-9231-2022; Leal-Taixe, Laura/HFZ-8079-2022; Prabha, Rajanie/AAK-8490-2021	Prabha, Rajanie/0000-0002-0854-0461; Tom, Manu/0000-0002-0352-7153; Schindler, Konrad/0000-0002-3172-9246; 														2072-4292				NOV	2020	12	21							3555	10.3390/rs12213555	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12213555													WOS:000589289200001
J	Ren, YQ; Wang, GH; Li, H				Ren, Yanqin; Wang, Gehui; Li, Hong			Spatial and seasonal variations of primary and secondary organic aerosols at urban areas and continental background site of China: Ambient levels, size distribution, and sources	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Organic aerosols are important constituents of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere, however, the studies on their size distribution, particularly for special primary and secondary organic aerosols (POA, SOA), are relatively limited. In this work, the size-segregated PM was collected from five megacities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Urumqi) and a continental background site (Qinghai Lake, Tibetan Plateau) of China during 2012-2014. Special POA (plant wax n-alkanes, fossil fuel n-alkanes, PAHs, levoglucosan, and trehalose) and biogenic SOA (BSOA, i.e. isoprene oxidants, monoterpene oxidants, and b-caryophyllenic acid) in PM were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. n-Alkanes were highest in autumn in the Southeast of China and highest in summer in the Northwest of China during the four seasons. PAHs and levoglucosan were higher in the cold season, mainly influenced by residential heating. Isoprene and monoterpene oxidants were higher in the warm season, while b-caryophyllenic acid was found to be much higher in cold seasons. n-Alkanes showed a monomodal distribution, with a peak at the fine mode (<1.1 gm). PAHs and levoglucosan were characterized by an accumulation mode, revealing the peak at <1.1 gm. However, only trehalose displayed coarse mode at the six sites, peaking at a size of 3.3-9.0 gm, because it was mostly derived from biota in desert regions. Isoprene oxidants including 2-methylglyceric acid, 2-methyltetrols, and C5-alkene triols exhibited a unimodal size distribution pattern with a peak in the fine mode. Monoterpene oxidants such as cis-pinic acid, pinonic acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid exhibited a bimodal size distribution pattern in the whole sampling time, peaking at the size range of <1.1 gm and 3.3-9.0 gm, respectively. Only b-caryophyllenic acid displayed a fine mode at the six sites during the whole sampling time. These findings can be used to support research into the origin and formation mechanisms of POA and BSOA. (c) 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Rodwell, MJ; Hoskins, BJ				Rodwell, MJ; Hoskins, BJ			Monsoons and the dynamics of deserts	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The existence of subtropical deserts, such as the Sahara, has often been attributed to the annual-mean, zonal-mean Hadley circulation which shows strong descent in the subtropics. However, the zonal-mean Hadley circulation shows considerable evolution over the course of the year with very strong subtropical descent during winter, but practically no zonal-mean subtropical descent during summer when rainfall over the eastern Sahara and the Mediterranean is least. Charney (1975) proposed a biosphere-albedo feedback mechanism whereby local anthropogenic effects related to over-grazing could affect the radiative balance, enhancing summertime diabatic descent and leading to desertification of the subtropics in general. The present study, which uses an idealized model, suggests a monsoon-desert mechanism for desertification whereby remote diabatic heating in the Asian monsoon region can induce a Rossby-wave pattern to the west. Integral with the Rossby-wave solution is a warm thermal structure that interacts with air on the southern flank of the mid-latitude westerlies causing it to descend. This adiabatic descent is localized over the eastern Sahara and Mediterranean, and over the Kyzylkum desert to the south-east of the Aral Sea, by the mountains of north Africa and south-west Asia. Trajectories indicate that the monsoon-desert mechanism does not represent a simple 'Walker-type' overturning cell. Instead, the descending air is seen to be mainly of mid-latitude origin. It is speculated that the monsoon-forced adiabatic descent may result in clear air and, therefore, a local diabatic enhancement which effectively doubles the strength of descent. With this mechanism, desertification can be forced by remote changes in monsoon strength rather than by local effects. This conclusion is supported by the observed dramatic strengthening of descent over the Mediterranean and east Sahara during the onset of the Asian monsoon and, on the longer timescale, by relating prehistoric lake-levels to Milankovitch-monsoon forcing. The latter may help to explain the perceived discrepancies between the palaeoclimate of the eastern Sahara and the strength of a 'tropic-wide' monsoon. The monsoon-desert mechanism may not be confined to the Asian monsoon alone and the existence of other monsoon-climate regions over the globe may, in a similar way, explain the observed summertime strengthening of the oceanic sub-tropical anticyclones and the existence of western continental deserts and 'Mediterranean-type' climate regions.

Fishes were captured by angling, surgically implanted with radio transmitters, and tracked actively from June through September. Most brook trout (96%) and landlocked salmon (72%) displayed long distance movements (>1 km) to open water bodies (28 June to 4 July) followed by periods of time spent in presumed thermal refugia (5 July to 16 September). Summer water temperature rose above 25 degrees C, near the reported lethal limits for these coldwater species. In contrast, the majority of smallmouth bass (68%), a warmwater species, did not make long distance movements from areas of initial capture, remaining in mainstem sections of the river (28 June to 16 September). Spatial overlap of smallmouth bass and brook trout in the summer is unlikely because brook trout presumably move to thermal refugia during this time. However, interspecific competition between brook trout and landlocked salmon may occur since they select similar habitats June through September.

This reduction in available light depends significantly on the dynamics of spring phytoplankton communities. However, the process and mechanisms behind these effects are not yet well understood. In this study, we conducted a field mesocosm experiment to observe the responses of the phytoplankton community to varying levels of light intensity (100%, 85%, and 65% photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). Our study revealed that reducing PAR resulted in an earlier peak of cyanobacterial biomass in spring, while the biomass of chlorophytes and bacillariophytes declined with decreasing light intensity. The weakening of light intensity promoted the recovery of photosynthetic activity in cyanobacteria but reduced the photosynthetic activity in chlorophytes and bacillariophytes. Additionally, the decrease in light intensity reduced the diversity of phytoplankton communities, accelerating the rate of species turnover. However, the rate of species turnover slowed down as the dominance of cyanobacteria was established in the later stages of the experiment. Therefore, the weakening of light intensity is beneficial to the early establishment of the dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community structure, accelerating the succession process of phytoplankton community. These findings contribute to the exploration of the effects of reduced light intensity on the establishment of cyanobacterial dominance in spring, providing valuable insights for the management of lake ecosystems.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Wang, Liya/AAQ-8579-2021	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													1386-2588	1573-5125				2023 AUG 6	2023										10.1007/s10452-023-10050-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-023-10050-w		AUG 2023											WOS:001043071100001

SG14 Project Members	Cryptotephra preserved in Lake Suigetsu (SG14 core) reveals the eruption timing and distribution of ash fall from Japanese volcanoes during the Late-glacial to early Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Long sedimentary successions extracted for palaeoclimate research regularly preserve volcanic ash (tephra) fall from explosive eruptions and are increasingly used to elucidate the timing and scale of past events. This study investigates the non-visible tephra (cryptotephra) layers preserved in the annually laminated and intensively 14C dated sediments of Lake Suigetsu (SG14 core), Japan. The cryptotephra investigations reported here focus on the Late-glacial to early Holocene sediments that were deposited between two visible tephra layers, the Ulleungdo (U)-Oki (10.2 ka) and the Sambe 'Sakate' (19.6 ka), and consequently span an interval of abrupt climate change making any newly identified cryptotephra layers invaluable chrono-stratigraphic markers. Using major and trace element volcanic glass compositions the cryptotephra are used to assign provenance to chrono-stratigraphically relevant eruption units. Five new cryptotephra layers are identified within this time interval. Three cryptotephra layers are from Kyushu volcanoes (SG14-1337 and SG14-1554 [Sakurajima]; and SG14-1806 [Kirishima]), all of which offer important chronological constraints on archaeological (Jomon) cultural transitions in southern Japan during the last termination. Another cryptotephra (SG14-1579), is assigned to activity on Niijima Island providing the first known distal occurrence and age of the eruption. Finally, the SG14-1798 cryptotephra precisely dated at 16,619 +/- 74 IntCal20 yrs BP (2 sigma) is linked to Asama (As) volcano and more precisely the later phases of the As-YKU eruption. This discovery greatly expands the distribution of ash fall from this multi-phased eruption at Asama volcano, which affected an area in the region of 120,000 km2. Refining the timing of the eruption and the distribution of As-YKU ash fall is important as it offers an excellent chrono- and climatostratigraphic marker suitable for assessing spatial variability in environmental response to past climate change during the termination of the last glacial.					; Manning, Christina/C-1135-2013; Ishimura, Daisuke/NOF-7945-2025; Smith, Victoria/AAA-4152-2021; Ikehara, Ken/N-2830-2018; Suzuki, Takehiko/AAY-8761-2021	Buckland, Hannah Maeve/0000-0002-9954-4993; Vineberg, Sophie/0000-0002-5850-0556; Albert, Paul/0000-0002-6757-1452; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				JAN 15	2024	324								108376	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108376		DEC 2023											WOS:001133055100001

Abdur			Introduction of floating gardening in the north-eastern wetlands of Bangladesh for nutritional security and sustainable livelihood	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS												Floating gardening is a form of hydroponics or soil-less culture. It is an age-old practice of crop cultivation in the floodplains of southern Bangladesh, where aquatic plants such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) are used to construct floating platforms on which seedlings are raised and vegetables and other crops cultivated in the rainy season. The platform residue is used in the preparation of beds for winter vegetable gardening. Floating gardening was introduced in 2006 on a pilot-scale in the north-east wetlands of the country, as a contribution to food security and as a supplementary income for the marginalized community. The overall experience of floating cultivation in three selected villages was encouraging. Local people became aware of this new farming system and their level of knowledge improved. Communities were mobilized into groups to make floating platforms, and platform residues were later used to establish winter gardens. Cultivation was successful on both types of plot, and vegetables were both consumed by the producers and sold in the market. The input-output analysis revealed floating gardening to be a feasible alternative livelihood option for the wetland dwellers. The method provided targeted landless people with parcels of land in the monsoon, enabling them to grow vegetables. Floating gardening and associated winter gardening appear to have the potential for introduction to other parts of the world where aquatic weed management is a major problem.					; GHANI, ABDUL/MYQ-8140-2025; , Haseeb/AAL-1498-2021	Irfanullah, Haseeb/0000-0002-5532-8922; 													1742-1705					JUN	2008	23	2					89	96		10.1017/S1742170507002074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742170507002074													WOS:000256533000001

Here, we analyze pre-industrial long-term trends from 1 to 1800 CE across the PAGES2k dataset and find that, in contrast to the gradual cooling apparent in ice core, marine, and lake sediment data, tree rings do not exhibit the same decline. To understand why tree-ring proxies lack any evidence of a significant pre-industrial cooling, we divide those data by location (high Northern Hemisphere latitudes vs. midlatitudes), seasonal response (annual vs. summer), de-trending method, and temperature sensitivity (high vs. low). We conclude that the ability of tree-ring proxies to detect pre-industrial, millennial-long cooling is not affected by latitude, seasonal sensitivity, or detrending method. Caution is advised when using multi-proxy approaches to reconstruct long-term temperature changes over the entire Common Era.					; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013	St. George, Scott/0000-0002-0945-4944; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				APR 9	2020	16	2					729	742		10.5194/cp-16-729-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-729-2020													WOS:000526031700002

The composition and structure of the epiphytic communities of the samples were determined at different levels: along the leaves, on both their sides and within each leaflet (n = 13). Forty-eight leaflets from four randomly selected plants were cut along the longitudinal and vertical axes so as to define 16 microhabitats located on the edge, the centre and the vein. Only a few species of algae were found to be constantly present whatever the sampling date, and dominated all microzones (n = 768). Their presence seemed to depend, rather, on the architectural structure of the plant. The other algae represented the major part of the epiphytic community and were only occasionally present. Those were more subject to temporal and environmental variations and less specific of the substrate. The epiphytes showed considerable spatial heterogeneity within their microhabitats, with an evident preference for the centre and the edge of the leaves, whereas two inhospitable spaces were the vein and apex. On the other hand, when the study was performed at a larger scale (along the leaf), the epiphytic populations of the youngest leaves (near the surface) and the eldest ones (close to the sediments) were homogenous, hence suggesting that other factors, independent from the physiology of the plant, may have an impact on epiphytic distribution.

This study uses China's Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water to establish thermal balance through the water surface temperature method. It examines LWHP discharge impacts on lake water temperature and defines a thermal pollution rate based on the lake's thermal load capacity. Using the Nanjing LWHP project as a case study, lake water temperature was measured, and thermal load capacity was analyzed to calculate thermal pollution rates for the coldest and hottest weeks. Results show a vertical temperature gradient in the lake affects refrigerant cooling efficiency and COP variation. The thermal load capacity of the lake is higher in winter than in summer. During the hottest week, the maximum thermal pollution rate for the Nanjing LWHP system is 0.58, and during the coldest week, it is 0.38, neither causing thermal pollution. This study is significant for the rational use of LWHP systems, aquatic ecosystem protection, and sustainable energy technology advancement.																			0140-7007	1879-2081				JUL	2025	175						288	298		10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2025.03.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2025.03.027		APR 2025											WOS:001476361500001

The limnetic zooplankton showed low species richness and biomass, and dominance by the rotifers Kellicottia bostoniensis and Polyarthra vulgaris. In the littoral, species richness and biomass were markedly higher, and the crustaceans Alona guttata, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, Chydorus sphaericus, Simocephalus serrulatus and Tropocyclops prasinus, and the rotifer Ascomorpha ecaudis were the dominants. The extreme rotifer dominance and lack of cladocerans in the limnetic zone were likely the result of Chaoborus predation. A pronounced mid-summer decline in cladoceran biomass in the littoral was likely due to predation by T. prasinus and Utricularia (bladderwort).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 7	1991	215	1					21	29		10.1007/BF00005897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005897													WOS:A1991FX93700003

The 2 basins of the lake were separated during winter 1977-1978 by a curtain and 300 kg of CH4 was dissolved into one side, to a maximum of 120 .mu.M/l or 0.7 M/m2. Oxidation occurred throughout the water column but the highest rates were at or near the sediment surface. High phosphate and nitrate additions did not stimulate oxidation. The sediments generated CH4 naturally and winter concentrations in undisturbed lakes were 0.2-1.0 .mu.M/l. The added CH4 disappeared at a slow, steady rate of 1.89 mM/m2 per d [day] or 0.32 .mu.M/l per d from Feb-June. The O2 depletion rate of the entire experimental basin was 0.244 g/m2 per d, compared with 0.210 in the control basin, and was not measurably affected by artifically added CH4; a winter pipeline rupture would probably not result in severe O2 depletion in downstream lakes. The knowledge of CH4 dynamics in temperate lakes was discussed.

A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), delta C-13, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially similar to 5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 43 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 02 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North Atlantic.

J	Stanfield, L; Jones, ML				Stanfield, L; Jones, ML			Factors influencing rearing success of Atlantic salmon stocked as fry and parr in Lake Ontario tributaries	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												From 1995 to 1999, we evaluated the suitability of various stream conditions for rearing juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the Lake Ontario watershed. As part of an ongoing initiative to reestablish this species in Lake Ontario, fry and parr were stocked into sites with contrasting amounts of rock and wood cover, fine materials in the substrate, and densities of rainbow trout Onchorhynchus mykiss. Resulting Atlantic salmon densities exceeded the target density of five age-0 fall fingerlings/100 m(2) at 52% of the site-years surveyed. Atlantic salmon stocked as parr (fed in hatchery before stocking; annual mean weights, 0.45-0.95 g) consistently had greater survival to the age-0 fall fingerling stage than those stocked as fry (not fed before stocking, annual mean weights, 0.13-0.20 g). The percentage of rock cover at a site was the best predictor of high densities of fall fingerling Atlantic salmon for the parr stocking strategy. For Atlantic salmon stocked as fry, the density of rainbow trout was the most influential variable, exhibiting a negative correlation, whereas the percentage of rock cover was also influential in discerning Atlantic salmon densities in a positive way. Our study also found that densities of fall fingerling Atlantic salmon at sites with high densities of rainbow trout (>1.5/m(2)) were greater than at sites where rainbow trout were present at lower densities, suggesting that habitat influenced the outcome of competitive interactions. High-quality habitat supported high densities of both species. The results of this study indicate that both above and below barriers in the north shore tributaries of Lake Ontario, sites exist with conditions suitable for rearing Atlantic salmon from the fry to the fall fingerling stage.																			0275-5947					NOV	2003	23	4					1175	1183		10.1577/M01-181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M01-181													WOS:000187125200010

Here, through observational analysis and hierarchy atmospheric model simulations with different complexity, we find that the Indian Ocean plays a crucial role in North American winter climate through a teleconnection termed the Indian Ocean - North America pattern. We show that in the warm Indian Ocean phase, this teleconnection contributes to anomalously cold winters along the west coast of the United States through advection with increased mountain snowfall, while simultaneously leading to warmer conditions over the Great Lakes region. Snow-albedo feedback amplifies these Rossby wave-induced surface anomalies. Remarkably, this teleconnection pattern is at work on both interannual and multi-decadal time scales, with its climatic impact being slightly less pronounced than that induced by tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies. Our findings underscore the significance of the Indian Ocean in both the prediction and future projection of North American climate. This study shows that the Indian Ocean significantly affects North American winter climate through Rossby wave dynamics. During its warm phase, this teleconnection drives an eastern warming - western cooling anomaly in North America, along with snowfall changes.

During the 4-yr study period, 538 collar sightings from 319 individuals were made and 179 collared geese were reported shot. Fifty-nine percent of marked geese were seen only once compared to 1% seen six times. Most sightings were made on the breeding and wintering grounds of northeastern California (51%) and wintering grounds on municipal water district reservoirs in counties surrounding San Francisco Bay (43%). San Pablo Dam Reservoir is the wintering area most used by Goose Lake and Telephone Flat Reservoir geese. Goose Lake and Telephone Flat Reservoir geese utilized some of the same reservoirs in the Bay Area, but did so in different proportions. The reservoirs are closed to hunting and consequently geese wintering there have less hunting pressure compared to those remaining in northeastern California. Meiss Lake and Tule Lake flocks were semi-resident and seldom left northeastern California. Tule Lake geese sustained a greater harvest than geese from the three molting areas. Some one- and two-yr old geese made a molt migration ot the Northwest Territories. A few geese wintered as far south as the San Joaquin Valley where they overlapped with the Rocky Mountain population.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				OCT	1985	71	4					196	209																WOS:A1985AZF1700001

Samples were taken every 4 hrs and 8 to 18 (mode 10) specimens were caught on each sampling occasion. A total of 233 fish (37.3-107.6 mm TL) gut contents were examined. Six main food components (Cladocera, Chironomidae (larvae and pupae), Copepoda, Ostracoda, other macroinvertebrates and detritus) were used by the fish. Precise identification of gut contents showed that spined loach consumed large numbers of food items (from 31 to 39). Nevertheless standardised form of Levin's and Shannon-Wiener's indices revealed a rather narrow food niche, which was a result Of unequal proportions of food items in gut contents and domination of few prey categories. Spined loach fed mostly from post-dusk to dawn and achieved maximum gut fullness in the morning (4.00-8.00). This nocturnal feeding pattern was consistent throughout all sampling occasions, but there was some discrepancy concerning 12.00 hours in spring and summer. Due to this, early morning activity can not be excluded. Prey selection indices indicated that spined loach preferentially consumed some small size chironomids: Tanytarsus, Cladotanytarsus, Dicrotendipes and avoided larger ones (Glyptotendipes, Stictochironomus).					; Valladolid, Maria/F-1011-2015	Marszal, Lidia/0000-0003-0171-6257; Przybylski, Miroslaw/0000-0001-5786-5695; Grzybkowska, Maria/0000-0002-0581-3321; Valladolid, Maria/0000-0002-7405-1105													0015-5497	1734-9168					2003	51			S			159	165											15303357					WOS:000188922200027

Mineralisation of dissolved organic matter by heterotrophic stream biofilm communities in a large boreal catchment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Boreal headwater streams typically receive large contributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from wetland and forest soils and can exhibit high CO2 effluxes, but little is known about how stream biofilm respiration of DOM responds to carbon and nutrient substrates in boreal catchments. 2. The aim of this study was to assess (i) the response of heterotrophic biofilms to increased availability of labile carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and (ii) how this response varies across sites differing in the source of catchment organic matter. 3. Normalised biofilm respiration rates (R-Biofilm) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of DOM sources derived from wetland, deciduous forest and ponds were up to 10 times greater than for coniferous forest DOM. Experimental additions of bog- and pond-derived DOM stimulated R-Biofilm in coniferous forest sites (1.5-2.5 times), adding further weight to the evidence for differing responses to stream DOM sources in this boreal catchment. 4. Mineralisation of added glucose by the biofilms was only increased by added N and P, coinciding with a reduction in mineralisation of the extant stream DOM. These findings suggest that increases in labile C, N and P can reduce biofilm mineralisation of stream dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus, perhaps due to the greater energy required to access the more complex DOM. 5. In 15 of 19 experiments, the addition of glucose had no effect on biofilm mineralisation of stream DOC (R-DOC). In the presence of added N and P, however, R-DOC decreased by 30 to 38% with the addition of glucose at sites with the most active biofilms in summer. When glucose was added alone, conversely, R-DOC was stimulated (40-50%) at these same sites in autumn, when biofilm respiration was lower and DOM more aromatic and less carbohydrate-rich. Combined, these results suggest labile C sources, such as algal exudates, may (i) compete as a source of energy and/or stimulate the incorporation rather than mineralisation of the more N- and P-rich stream DOM or (ii) stimulate the mineralisation of stream DOM, potentially depending upon nutrient availability and the composition of stream DOM.

To characterize variability in lake extents, we analyzed summertime lake area loss (i.e., shrinkage) on two deltas over the past 20 years, using Landsat-derived water masks. We find that monthly shrinkage rates have a pronounced structured variability around the channel network with the shrinkage rate systematically decreasing farther away from the channels. This pattern of shrinkage is predominantly attributed to a deeper active layer enhancing near-surface connectivity and storage and greater vegetation density closer to the channels leading to increased evapotranspiration rates. This shrinkage signal, easily extracted from remote sensing observations, may offer the means to constrain estimates of lacustrine methane emissions and to develop process-based estimates of depth to permafrost on arctic deltas. Plain Language Summary The numerous lakes and ponds on arctic deltas emit large quantities of methane, but changes in lake area over spring and summer confound emission estimates. We studied summertime changes in lake area in two deltas over the past 20 years and found that lake area shrank at a higher rate closer to river channels on the delta. Thicker vegetation which increases water loss and a deeper unfrozen soil layer which stores more water underground closer to the channels are likely contributors to the observed higher shrinkage rates. This information can be used to improve estimates of methane emissions from lakes on arctic deltas, to monitor future changes in a warming climate, and to develop physically based models of depth to permafrost on arctic deltas.

Urban landscapes and legacy industry provide hotspots for riverine greenhouse gases: A source-to-sea study of the River Clyde	WATER RESEARCH												There is growing global concern that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from water bodies are increasing because of interactions between nutrient levels and climate warming. This paper investigates key land-cover, seasonal and hydrological controls of GHGs by comparison of the semi-natural, agricultural and urban environments in a detailed source-to-sea study of the River Clyde, Scotland. Riverine GHG concentrations were consistently oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere. High riverine concentrations of methane (CH4) were primarily associated with point source inflows from urban wastewater treatment, abandoned coal mines and lakes, with CH4-C concentrations between 0.1 - 44 mu g l- 1. Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were mainly driven by nitrogen concentrations, dominated by diffuse agricultural inputs in the upper catchment and supplemented by point source inputs from urban wastewater in the lower urban catchment, with CO2-C concentrations between 0.1 - 2.6 mg l- 1 and N2O-N concentrations between 0.3 - 3.4 mu g l- 1. A significant and disproportionate increase in all GHGs occurred in the lower urban riverine environment in the summer, compared to the semi-natural environment, where GHG concentrations were higher in winter. This increase and change in GHG seasonal patterns points to anthropogenic impacts on microbial communities. The loss of total dissolved carbon, to the estuary is approximately 48.4 +/- 3.6 Gg C yr- 1, with the annual inorganic carbon export approximately double that of organic carbon and four times that of CO2, with CH4 accounting for 0.03%, with the anthropogenic impact of disused coal mines accelerating DIC loss. The annual loss of total dissolved nitrogen to the estuary is approximately 4.03 +/- 0.38 Gg N yr- 1 of which N2O represents 0.06%.

The water quality of the lake affects social development and the lives of residents. To assess the impacts of environmental changes and human activities on the distribution of the total suspended matter (TSM) in the Hongze Lake, we developed an algorithm that utilizes the near-infrared (NIR) band to estimate TSM based on in situ measurements. The algorithm was applied to Landsat images to derive TSM distribution maps from 1984 to 2019, revealing significant inter-annual, seasonal, and spatial variability. The relationship between TSM, precipitation, and wind speed was analyzed, and we found that: (1) The estimation model of TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake constructed for TM and OLI has a high accuracy, and it can be used to jointly monitor TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake for long-term series; (2) From 1984 to 2019, the concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake showed a trend of first rising and then falling, with the maximum value in 2010 at 100.18 mg/L mainly caused by sand mining activities. Precipitation and wind speed weakly influence the inter-annual variation of TSM concentration; (3) The concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake in summer is easily affected by flooding in the Huai River, and the concentration of TSM in other seasons is significantly negatively correlated with precipitation; (4) TSM is highest in the Huaihe Bay, followed by the Lihe Bay and Chengzi Bay. The main reason for this is that the input of the Huaihe Bay flows directly into this lake area and is also the main navigation channel. The results of this study are of great significance for the protection and management of the water environment of the Hongze Lake.

Effects of habitat and pulp and paper mill contamination on a population of brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans)	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												This study examined the responses of a population of brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) exposed to pulp mill effluent at Jackfish Bay, Lake Superior, Canada, in May 2007 and May 2011. Brook stickleback were extirpated from the effluent-receiving site, presumably due to anoxia after this period. Females at the effluent-receiving site had significantly larger gonad sizes in 2007 and 2011. In 2011, effluent-exposed female gonadal development was significantly advanced when compared with reference sites; they were the second most mature when compared among three different reference sites. Analysis of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity revealed that effluent-receiving site females had greater CYP1A induction in 2007 and significantly greater CYP1A induction in 2011. Effluent-receiving site males showed significantly reduced CYP1A induction in 2007 and significantly greater induction in 2011. Chemical evaluation of sediment from the receiving environment showed elevated levels of resin acids and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, retene. Higher condition factors and more mature gonads were consistent with higher winter and spring temperatures modified by effluent or by lake vs. stream environments. Overall, effects on effluent-exposed brook stickleback were not consistent with reported effects in white sucker exposed to the same effluent in previous studies.					; van+den+Heuvel, Michael/ABF-1188-2020	Hogan, Natacha/0000-0002-9782-2136; 													1201-3080					FEB	2020	55	1					52	66		10.2166/wqrj.2019.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2019.005													WOS:000518632500004

Small mouth, big appetite: diet analysis of invasive smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in Cultus Lake, British Columbia	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												As aquatic invasive species spread, their impacts on native systems are variable and important to understand from a management perspective. DNA sequencing and morphological analysis of stomach contents can provide insight into the diet of invasive opportunistic feeders, such as smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). Since their illegal introduction in 2017, smallmouth bass have proliferated in Cultus Lake, British Columbia and potential impacts on two species-at-risk (sockeye salmon and pygmy sculpin) are currently unknown. Bass (n = 204) were sampled in the spring/summer of 2020-2021 in Cultus Lake. DNA barcoding (n = 145) and visual analysis (n = 204) of diet were completed. Diet composition, factors influencing the predation of species-at-risk, and dietary shifts were analyzed. DNA analysis identified 32 more taxa at the family level than morphological analysis. Multiple logistic regression showed that bass were more likely to predate on Oncorhynchus nerka within the bass spawning grounds, and over 90% of bass had sculpin in their diets. Diet composition did not shift as bass size changed, demonstrating sustained predation on fish from 100 to > 300 mm total length. These results highlight the importance of understanding the potential impacts of an invasive species before investing in suppression to create effective plans and leverage funding opportunities.

Surface scum (0-1 m) forms as a result of vertical migration by buoyant Microcystis colonies. Accurate forecasting of bloom and scum development is essential for establishing a reliable alert system and requires understanding the role that physicobiological factors play in the vertical distribution of Microcystis in natural ecosystems. We researched the role of limnological processes on the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies in Lake Kinneret (max depth = 38 m) during a winter-spring bloom. We used measurements from a Laser In situ Scattering and Transmissometry profiler and a plankton image analyser, FlowCAM. Various hydrometeorological conditions were captured during 6 outings from 9 February to 21 March 2017. Thermal stratification and turbulence levels influenced the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies and scum formation. During periods of weak turbulence (e.g., vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity [K-z] <1 cm(2) s(-1)), the volume concentration of Microcystis colonies near the surface abruptly increased. High turbulence levels (e.g., windy conditions) dispersed colonies concentrated near the surface. Simulations of the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies under different turbulence levels showed that the thickness of the surface scum layer increased and colony concentration of scum decreased as turbulence level increased. We demonstrated that K-z >3 cm(2) s(-1), driven by the wind and surface heating/cooling, dispersed the surface layer of concentrated Microcystis colonies. Our results revealed an underlying interdependency between environmental factors and Microcystis colony distribution that can be utilized to accurately forecast scum formation.					; Gildor, Hezi/AAZ-6602-2021; Ostrovsky, Ilia/M-4831-2017	Gildor, Hezi/0000-0003-0898-6292; Ostrovsky, Ilia/0000-0002-0247-7844													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2020	10	1					51	70		10.1080/20442041.2019.1637681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1637681		NOV 2019											WOS:000500381800001
J	Bird, BW; Abbott, MB; Finney, BP; Kutchko, B				Bird, Broxton W.; Abbott, Mark B.; Finney, Bruce P.; Kutchko, Barbara			A 2000 year varve-based climate record from the central Brooks Range, Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Varved minerogenic sediments from glacial-fed Blue Lake, northern Alaska, are used to investigate late Holocene climate variability. Varve-thickness measurements track summer temperature recorded at Atigun Pass, located 41 km east at a similar elevation (r (2) = 0.31, P = 0.08). Results indicate that climate in the Brooks Range from 10 to 730 AD (varve year) was warm with precipitation inferred to be higher than during the twentieth century. The varve-temperature relationship for this period was likely compromised and not used in our temperature reconstruction because the glacier was greatly reduced, or absent, exposing sub-glacial sediments to erosion from enhanced precipitation. Varve-inferred summer temperatures and precipitation decreased after 730 AD, averaging 0.4A degrees C above the last millennial average (LMA = 4.2A degrees C) from 730 to 850 AD, and 0.1A degrees C above the LMA from 850 to 980 AD. Cooling culminated between 980 and 1030 AD with temperatures 0.7A degrees C below the LMA. Varve-inferred summer temperatures increased between 1030 and 1620 AD to the LMA, though the period between 1260 and 1350 AD was 0.2A degrees C below the LMA. Although there is no equivalent to the European Medieval Warm Period in the Blue Lake record, two warm intervals occurred from 1350 to 1450 AD and 1500 to 1620 AD (0.4 and 0.3A degrees C above the LMA, respectively). During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1620 to 1880 AD), inferred summer temperature averaged 0.2A degrees C below the LMA. After 1880 AD, inferred summer temperature increased to 0.8A degrees C above the LMA, glaciers retreated, but aridity persisted based on a number of regional paleoclimate records. Despite warming and glacial retreat, varve thicknesses have not achieved pre-730 AD levels. This reflects limited sediment availability and transport due to a less extensive retreat compared to the first millennium, and continued relative aridity. Overall, the Blue Lake record is similar to varve records from the eastern Canadian Arctic that document a cool LIA and twentieth century warming. However, the occurrence and timing of events, such as the LIA and Medieval Warm Period, varies considerably among records, suggesting heterogeneous climatic patterns across the North American Arctic.

Shallow groundwater flow and inverted fresh/saline-water interface in a hypersaline endorheic basin (Great Basin, USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Pilot Valley is an 828-km(2)arid-region endorheic basin in western USA. Bounding mountain ranges rise as much as 1,900 m above the nearly flat 379-km(2)playa floor. Up to 3.8 m of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville mud and thin oolitic sand layers form the surface layer of the basin floor. Groundwater conditions were evaluated using data from shallow monitoring wells and borings, springs, infiltrometer measurements, slug and dilution tests, geophysical transects, and precision elevation surveys. Alluvial fan groundwater discharges at fan/playa interface springs and underflows to the shallow basin sediments along the western side of the basin; the groundwater only underflows along the eastern side. Precision surveying established a Lake Bonneville shore-line break in slope as the cause of the spring discharges. Tectonic tilting causes groundwater to flow from east to west and to the topographic low. Monthly measured and pressure transducer data established seasonal pressure responses and upward groundwater gradients. All basin groundwater is lost to evapotranspiration at the topographic low, where a thin salt pan has developed. Groundwater evolves from fresh to hypersaline near the alluvial fan/playa interface where there is an inverted salinity gradient and a groundwater pressure ridge. The pressure ridge and inverted salinity interface are due to: (1) osmotic pressure established between the oolitic sand of high hydraulic conductivity and the overlying low-hydraulic-conductivity lake mud at the fan/playa interface, and (2) the collision between fresh groundwater flow driven by a steep hydraulic head and hypersaline groundwater flow driven by a nearly flat hydraulic head.					; Bruthans, Jiri/I-4167-2016	Carling, Gregory/0000-0001-5820-125X; Bruthans, Jiri/0000-0002-4749-0583													1431-2174	1435-0157				DEC	2020	28	8					2877	2902		10.1007/s10040-020-02209-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02209-8		AUG 2020											WOS:000559269200001

M.; Ploug, Helle			High cell-specific rates of nitrogen and carbon fixation by the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon sp at low temperatures in the Baltic Sea	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Aphanizomenon is a widespread genus of nitrogen (N-2)-fixing cyanobacteria in lakes and estuaries, accounting for a large fraction of the summer N-2-fixation in the Baltic Sea. However, information about its cell-specific carbon (C)- and N-2-fixation rates in the early growth season has not previously been reported. We combined various methods to study N-2-fixation, photosynthesis and respiration in field-sampled Baltic Sea Aphanizomenon sp. during early summer at 10 degrees C. Stable isotope incubations at in situ light intensities during 24 h combined with cell-specific secondary ion mass spectrometry showed an average net N-2-fixation rate of 55 fmol N cell(-1) day(-1). Dark net N-2-fixation rates over a course of 12 h were 20% of those measured in light. C-fixation, but not N-2-fixation, was inhibited by high ambient light intensities during daytime. Consequently, the C: N fixation ratio varied substantially over the diel cycle. C-and N-2-fixation rates were comparable to those reported for Aphanizomenon sp. in August at 19 degrees C, using the same methods. High respiration rates (23% of gross photosynthesis) were measured with C-14-incubations and O-2-microsensors, and presumably reflect the energy needed for high N-2-fixation rates. Hence, Aphanizomenon sp. is an important contributor to N-2-fixation at low in situ temperatures in the early growth season.

J	LEACH, JH				LEACH, JH			BIOTA OF LAKE ST-CLAIR - HABITAT EVALUATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As a shallow, productive lake in the drainage system between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair provides habitat for a diverse biota including significant populations of fish and wildlife that are of use to man. Of the more than 70 species of native and migrant fishes, 43 use the lake for spawning. Peak numbers of waterfowl utilizing the lake and adjoining wetlands have been estimated at 60 000 in spring and 150 000 in autumn. In addition to recreational fishing and hunting, the lake is also used for swimming, boating and as a source of municipal water. It is located downstream from an industrial centre and adjacent to a population estimated at about four million. Mercury contamination closed the fisheries in 1970 and concentrations of the metal persist above consumption guidelines in some species. Almost all of the Michigan shoreline is urbanized and much of it altered through dyking and bulkheading. Coastal wetlands of the lake have declined 41 percent in the past century and only about one-half of the remaining area is open to the lake. Despite impacts from the large urban population and users, ecosystem quality remains reasonably good. The flushing action of relatively clean water from Lake Huron has slowed the eutrophication process. Major habitat problems are toxic substances from industries located on the St. Clair River and the continued loss of shoreline and wetlands to urbanization and agriculture. Further research and monitoring of sources, fates and impacts of toxic substances in sediments and biota are required. In addition, there is a need for environmental and economic evaluations of shorelines and wetlands to prevent further losses of these important habitats.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						187	202		10.1007/BF00024755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024755													WOS:A1991GK03100013
J	Cao, JT; Chen, FJ; Chu, GQ; Jia, GD				Cao, Jiantao; Chen, Fajin; Chu, Guoqiang; Jia, Guodong			A Persistent Coast Mode of Precipitation in Southeast China Over the Last Millennium	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Instrumental data set have revealed several summer precipitation patterns in eastern China, being summarized as "tripole," "dipole" and "coast" modes. The former two have been found to persist at different time scales, leaving the latter unclear in geological records. Here we present 1300-year hydroclimate records in a tropical maar lake in the southern coast of China using archeal lipid GDGTs, which can reflect lower water redox conditions largely regulated by lake water depth. The down-core GDGTs reveal a relatively drier condition during the medieval climate anomaly compared to the Little Ice Age, in-phase with other records in southeast coast of China but opposite to the inland region, hence demonstrating a persistent "coast" mode in eastern China. The thermal state of equatorial Pacific is suggested to play an important role in shaping the "coast" mode by modulating the location and strength of the western Pacific subtropical high and tropical typhoons. Summer precipitations in eastern China affect more than 1 billion people's lives and economic development. It is well-known that summer precipitations in eastern China show spatial differences. A seesaw pattern of summer precipitations between the southeast coast and the inland region of China, called "coast" mode, has been proposed from modern observations. However, whether this "coast" mode persists in the past remains unexplored. Here, we present a 1300-year lake-level record based on GDGTs, a suit of archeal lipids, in a coastal lake of southern China. The result shows a dry medieval climate anomaly and wet Little Ice Age. This result is consistent with other records in southeast coast of China, but in contrast with those in the inland region, thereby proving the persistent of the "coast" mode in the last millennium. The movement of western Pacific subtropical high and tropical typhoon associated with thermal state of the equatorial Pacific could result in this "coast" mode.

This reflects periodical variations in snow accumulation over Lake Bramant catchment area partly influencing the glacier mass balance in the watershed. Further comparisons with reconstructed NAO(w) index since ad 1500 highlight spatial and temporal variations of the pluridecadal NAO(w) influence on this alpine climate, especially at the end of the Little Ice Age'. In addition, wavelet analysis of continuous proxies of clastic sedimentation over the last 4150 years indicates significant pluridecadal variability at frequencies compatible with the NAO (30 years), while periods centered at 60-70 years could also be linked to the North Atlantic Ocean-atmosphere internal variability (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)). The influence of the North Atlantic deep water production on the regional alpine climate is also suggested by a significant 550 yr cycle of clastic inputs since 2800 cal. BP. Coupling between the North Atlantic Ocean and the atmosphere seems therefore to play a fundamental role on glacier mass balance and climate during the late Holocene in the western Alps.

Does overwinter temperature affect maternal body composition and egg traits in yellow perch Perca flavescens?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Female yellow perch Perca flavescens exposed to three overwinter temperature regimes (4, 8 and 13 degrees C) for 150days spawned in markedly different proportions upon spring warming (37% of females in 4 degrees C v. 64 and 91% in 8 and 13 degrees C treatments, respectively), but exhibited no differences in fecundity, egg size or egg lipid content. Females held at 4 degrees C also exhibited less within-clutch egg size variation than females held at 13 degrees C. Moreover, eggs differed among temperature treatments in the overall proportions of 18 fatty acids, with the colder treatments resulting in potentially higher quality eggs containing more of the unsaturated fatty acids C16:1, C22:6-n3 and C18:2 cis. Female somatic condition also varied with temperature. Maternal somatic growth and protein content increased while lipid content decreased in 13 degrees C compared to the colder treatments. There were, however, no differences among treatments in the fatty acid composition of maternal muscle. These results suggest that the temperatures experienced during winter may be less influential to P. flavescens egg size or number, which may exhibit relatively little plasticity in this species, but can alter both the number of females that spawn and the overall composition of eggs and maternal somatic tissues, which may have implications for future reproductive success.

J	ROBBINS, JA; EADIE, BJ				ROBBINS, JA; EADIE, BJ			SEASONAL CYCLING OF TRACE-ELEMENTS CS-137, BE-7, AND PU-239+240 IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Trace elements, fallout Cs-137(t1/2 = 30.2 years) and cosmogenic Be-7 (t1/2 = 53.4 days) were measured in trap samples collected from two sites in southern Lake Michigan at selected times during the period from 1982 through 1987. Concentrations of Cs-137 in trap material were virtually constant from top to bottom during the period when the lake was vertically well-mixed. Fluxes of Cs-137 were more than two orders of magnitude higher than atmospheric loading. With the development of the thermocyline, concentrations of the isotope diminished to undetectable levels at a rate indicating a 1-month residence time of resuspended components in the epilimnion. Declines in mass flux (10 to 0.2 g m-2 d-1) and trace element concentrations (some by 30 x) also occurred at this time. Epilimnetic concentration of Be-7 increased from a prestratification value of about 30 dpm/g to a maximum of about 120 dpm/g in July. During calcite formation in August, the concentration rapidly declined mainly as a result of enhanced particle settling rates. Throughout the period of stratification, a maximum in concentration and flux of Be-7 persisted in trap material between 40 and 60 m depth but only about 15% of the atmospheric flux was transferred to the benthic boundary region below 60 m. In near-bottom trap materials, the Cs-137 concentration was reduced at the onset of stratification by addition of radiocesium-deficient authigenic materials. By November, concentrations of Cs-137 had returned to prestratification levels through remineralization of these materials. A decrease of 22% in the seasonally invariant ratio of Cs-137/K-40 between 1982 and 1986 indicated a decay-corrected removal time of about 20 years, which is consistent with the rate of decrease of Pu concentrations in the well-mixed water column measured over more than a decade. In benthic trap samples, Be-7 concentration decreased exponentially throughout the stratified period, with a time constant comparable to the half-life of the isotope. The resuspendable sediment pool, evidently isolated from atmospheric loading during stratification, was "recharged" with Be-7 following late fall overtum. Box and advection-diffusion models describing the storage and vertical distribution of Be-7 during the winter-mixing period successfully account for observations, implying an inverse relation between water depth and winter recharging of the resuspendable pool. A plutonium-calibrated box model for the seasonal cycle of tracers in surface waters describes the main features of the variation of Pu isotopes, Cs-137 and Be-7.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 15	1991	96	C9					17081	17104		10.1029/91JC01412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC01412													WOS:A1991GG23900030

It supports many activities, including recreation, tourism, and a commercial fishing industry, but its prime function is to supply water to other parts of the country. Consequently, maintaining a high water quality of the lake is of prime importance. The major part (some 90%) of the annual runoff of water enters Lake Kinneret from the north via the Jordan River during the autumn-winter floods. During this period, the river carries sediments, toxic agricultural chemicals, and allochthonous organisms, including pathogenic bacteria, into the lake. The Jordan River-Lake Kinneret Contact zone is characterized by a rapid transformation from a riverine to a lacustrine water mass within 700 m from the river mouth, with very high spatial gradients of practically all hydrodynamic, hydrophysical, hydrochemical, and microbiological parameters. Previous measurements have shown that the distribution of enteric bacteria in the river-lake contact zone is related to the attenuation of river current flows. The aim of this study was to determine whether the change in the number of enteric bacteria (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp.) in the water of the River Jordan-Lake Kinneret contact zone was due to sedimentation or to dilution. The data were then utilized to build a conceptual model explaining the distribution of biological pollutants (bacteria) in the river-lake contact zone of a shallow tropical lake, using the microbial communities of the River Jordan-Lake Kinneret contact zone, as an example.																			1528-7394					OCT-NOV	2004	67	20-22					1705	1715		10.1080/15287390490492458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15287390490492458								15371210					WOS:000224231900012

In this study cyanobacterial surface coverage was assessed through satellite image analysis of Tehran drinking water reservoirs in late summer and early autumn of 2018. We also analysed freshwater cyanobacteria including seven local strains purified from surface water samples. Following a polyphasic taxonomic approach combining morphological and molecular methods the culturable strains were classified into Synechococcales and Oscillatoriales, representing at least three families and four genera. Similarity-based analysis of their partial 16S rRNA genes showed 93.4-97.0% sequence identity among the strains from different ecosystems. Considering 95-96% as the overall cut-off for discriminating bacterial species, strains UTMC6011 and UTMC6013 are likely to be new species. Physiological characterization of the new strains and nine others isolated previously by our group from another freshwater ecosystem led to identification of seven nitrogen-fixing, 11 sulphide-tolerant, three salt-tolerant and three heterotrophic strains. Further taxonomic analyses are needed to support investigation of their biotechnological potential. The biodiversity and physiology of cyanobacteria in the main drinking water reservoirs of the megacity, Tehran, were studied by remote sensing and sample analysis.Seven cyanobacterial strains were isolated from the two freshwater lakes. Similarity-based analysis of obtained 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 93.4-97.0% sequence similarity with the strains from other ecosystems.Cyanobacterial isolates of these freshwater reservoirs included seven N2-fixing, 11 sulphide-tolerant, three salt-tolerant and three heterotrophic strains.

J	Zeng, ZX; Sun, JQ; He, SP				Zeng, Zixuan; Sun, Jianqi; He, Shengping			Importance of Intraseasonal Oscillation for the Regional Extreme Consecutive dry Days Events in Spring Over Southern China	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study investigates the influences of intraseasonal oscillation on two types of regional extreme consecutive dry days events (RECDD) in spring over Southern China (SC). For type-1 RECDD occurring in entire SC, the 7-25 days and 25-90 days high over Lake Balkhash-Baikal are important. The 7-25 days high first causes lower-tropospheric northerlies and moisture deficit in SC, then propagates to Yangtze River Basin and causes lower-tropospheric warming and decaying moisture deficit in SC. These processes favor dry condition in SC for 1 week. In comparison, the 25-90 days high and associated lower-tropospheric warming and moisture deficit in SC favor dry condition there for more than one week. For type-2 RECDD occurring in the southern part of SC, the 7-25 days and 25-90 days high over Northeast Asia are important. The 7-25 days high contributes for one week. It first causes lower-tropospheric anticyclone around the East China Sea and south-negative-north-positive moisture pattern in SC, then propagates to the Sea of Japan and causes lower-tropospheric south-warming-north-cooling pattern and decaying south-negative-north-positive moisture pattern in SC. In comparison, the 25-90 days high and associated lower-tropospheric south-warming-north-cooling pattern and south-negative-north-positive moisture pattern in SC favor south-dry-north-wet pattern there for more than one week. Moreover, the 7-25 days low and decaying 25-90 days high over Lake Balkhash-Baikal, concurring with 7-25 days low over Bay of Bengal, favor the end of type-1 RECDD; the 7-25 days low and decaying 25-90 days high over Northeast Asia favor the end of type-2 RECDD. The extreme consecutive dry days with long duration could increase the risk of drought, even if the mean precipitation does not show significant change. In this study, we identify two types of regional extreme consecutive dry days events in spring over Southern China (type-1 occurs in entire Southern China, type-2 occurs in southern part of Southern China), with the aim of understanding the direct physical processes responsible for the persistence of extreme consecutive dry days. The results show that anomalous high over Lake Balkhash-Baikal/Northeast Asia on two time-scales (7-25 days and 25-90 days) are important for the persistence of type-1/type-2 events. In comparison, the 7-25 days high favors the persistence of regional events for approximately one week, whereas the 25-90 days high favors longer. Moreover, the 7-25 days low and decaying 25-90 days high over Lake Balkhash-Baikal, combined with 7-25 days low over Bay of Bengal, provide a favorable condition for the end of type-1 events. The 7-25 days low and decaying 25-90 days high over Northeast Asia favor the end of type-2 events. Two types of regional extreme consecutive dry days events in Southern China (SC) are identified in this study 7-25 days high over Lake Balkhash-Baikal/Northeast Asia favors type-1/type-2 events for one week, and 25-90 days high over there favors longer 7-25 days low over Lake Balkhash-Baikal/Northeast Asia, combined with decaying 25-90 days high there, favors the end of type-1/type-2 events					He, Shengping/A-4084-2017	Zeng, Zixuan/0000-0002-0054-3449; HE, Shengping/0000-0003-4245-357X													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 16	2024	129	17							e2024JD041498	10.1029/2024JD041498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JD041498													WOS:001309191300001

Movement of Walleye in Lewis and Clark Lake Inferred From Acoustic Telemetry	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Walleye Sander vitreus is an economically important sport fish species with highly variable movement patterns, with individuals exhibiting site residency and others moving up to 350 km. Movement patterns of walleye are affected by both river regulation and shifting environmental conditions. We utilized mark-recapture models to assess walleye movement among four management zones corresponding to roughly quarters of the reservoir on Lewis and Clark Lake, a mainstem Missouri River reservoir. We implanted adult walleye (n = 134) with acoustic tags and assessed movement patterns during 2021-2024. We assessed the relationship between variation in mean weekly movement and environmental factors (e.g., drought, precipitation, temperature) and flow characteristics (e.g., discharge, reservoir elevation) using multiple linear regression. We estimated exploitation from angler-reported tag returns and estimated entrainment from detections on receivers placed below Gavins Point Dam. A multistate live-dead model approach suggested apparent survival (mean 88%) varied among seasons, and transition and resight probabilities varied among zones. Walleye movement was driven primarily by reservoir elevation, season, and temperature. Increased temperature was correlated to increased mean weekly male walleye movement. Seasonal walleye concentrations were evident below Fort Randall Dam in the spring and above Gavins Point Dam in the winter. Annual exploitation estimates ranged from 6% to 19%, and annual entrainment estimates ranged from 0% to 3%. Examination of adult walleye movement patterns enables focused management on identified spawning and overwintering areas. Assessment of sources of loss (e.g., entrainment, exploitation) enables fisheries managers to evaluate the appropriateness of current harvest regulations. Identification of the interplay between river regulation and environmental conditions enables managers to have a baseline to reference as environmental conditions shift toward warmer water temperatures.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2025	41	7					1478	1492		10.1002/rra.4456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4456		MAY 2025											WOS:001484383100001

Lake Superior's summer cooling of shorelines and adjacent inland forests: Implications for refugia of boreal forests and disjunct arctic-alpine plants	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Climate refugia can serve as remnant habitat for cold-adapted species and delay forest transitions. The world's largest freshwater lake by surface area, Lake Superior, serves as a model system for understanding cooling-mediated refugia effects, as its cool summer water temperatures have maintained disjunct populations of arctic-alpine plants on its shoreline since deglaciation. It is known to affect local inland climates by providing a summer cooling effect; however, the inland temperature gradient and spatial patterns of cooling have not been well quantified. Here, we describe the extent, degree, and patterns of temperature buffering and examine drivers of buffering and disjunct plant occurrence for Lake Superior's north shore over a 3-year period at distances of 10, 100 m, 1, 10, and 100 km inland. We analyzed temperature data by year, month, summer maximum (July), and growing degree days (GDD(0)) for each site. Average summertime cooling at shore sites (10 m) was similar to 5 degrees C cooler than reference sites (100 km inland), with a maximum difference of -19.2 degrees C. The magnitude of cooling varied geographically, with sites further west and southeast showing little to no cooling effect, while the exposed north-central shore showed the highest degree of buffering (5.8 degrees C cooler) and had a shorter growing season than reference sites. Finally, north-central shorelines had fewer days above 16 degrees C, a threshold above which disjunct plants are unlikely to grow. These sites also showed the highest proportion of disjunct arctic-alpine species, reflecting the highest buffering from inland sites. On north-central shores, sites up to 10 km inland had less than 10 days per year warmer than 20 degrees C, a threshold identified for boreal forest transition. An understanding of the extent of lake-mediated cooling on adjacent forests can better inform the risk to disjunct species, inland forests, and vegetation transition models on Lake Superior's north shore.

Main drivers in the structure and dynamics of the zooplankton community in a Pampean seepage shallow lake throughout an annual cycle during turbid and clear water regimes	INTERNATIONAL AQUATIC RESEARCH												We investigated the composition and dynamics of the zooplankton community in a Pampean seepage lake (Buenos Aires, Argentina) under different environmental (rainfall, hydrometric level, conductivity, transparency) and biotic (phytoplankton biomass and presence of submerged macrophytes) conditions. In the annual cycle analyzed, the shallow lake evidenced alternating turbid- and clear-water periods associated with changes in phytoplankton biomass and the extent of colonization by submerged macrophytes. Thirty-five species were identified (21 rotifers, nine cladocerans and five copepods). Only six species were perennial: the rotifers Brachionus caudatus. Keratella tropica; the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia; and the copepods Notodiaptomus incompositus, Afetacyclops mendocinus. and Microcyclops dubitabilis. The zooplankton manifested a similar annual-abundance pattern in the three sampling stations established. Density and biomass peaks occurred in autumn during the clear phase without submerged macrophytes, whereas minimum values were obtained during the turbid phase. The presence of submerged macrophytes favored the zooplankton community, as evidenced by an increased abundance (twice that recorded during the turbid period) and species richness (from 20 to 30 species), with both parameters being associated with increased possibilities for zooplankton refuge plus an incorporation of periphy tic and benthic species. Rotifers always predominated numerically. The copepod contribution prevailed throughout the annual cycle with respect to biomass except in spring when the cladocerans were more prevalent. These findings demonstrated that the zooplankton community responded positively to the changes that occurred in the enviromnental conditions of the lake between the turbid- and the clear-water states.

However, ice thickness has been studied less intensively, both spatially and temporally. Here, we quantified the trends and drivers of ice thickness from 27 lakes and rivers across North America. We found that ice thickness declined on average by 1.2 cm per decade, although ice thickness declined significantly in only four waterbodies. Local winter air temperature, cloud cover, and winter precipitation were the most important determinants of ice thickness, explaining over 81% of the variation in ice thickness. Ice thickness was lower in years and regions with higher air temperatures, high percentage of cloud cover, and high winter precipitation. Our results suggest that warming is contributing to thinning ice, particularly at high latitudes, with potential ramifications to the safety of humans and wildlife populations using freshwater ice for travel and recreation.					; Yousaf, Z./D-5472-2017	Imrit, Mohammad Arshad/0000-0001-9760-4625; Yousaf, Z./0000-0001-8227-2621; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768														2073-4441				JUN	2022	14	12							1841	10.3390/w14121841	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14121841													WOS:000816373700001

Assessment and Management of Pollution Sources	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Lake Kastoria, is a very fragile aquatic ecosystem, protected by several national and international conventions, situated in the Region of Western Macedonia, Greece. A monthly monitoring program has been operated by the Municipality of Kastoria, during the past 5 years (2002-2007). The water quality parameters monitored, are: Water Temperature (Tw), dissolved oxygen (DO), BOD, COD, pH, water conductivity (ECw), redox potential (RP), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and orthophosphates-dissolved inorganic phosphorus (PO4-P-DIP). This study focuses on the water quality parameters of Tw, DO, NH4-N, NO3-N and PO4-P. The sampling points are five, scattered in specific positions in the Lake (Sioutista, Xiropotamos, Mavriotissa, Northern Beach and Stavros-Southern Beach). A comparison took place between two spatial-geographic deterministic simulation algorithms "IDW" and "RBF", using GIS. This resulted in the conclusion that the first algorithm is the most appropriate to formulate the equipotential curves of the selected water quality parameters. Data from two seasons (winter-frozen Lake and summer-high eutrophication level) and 2 years (2005 and 2006) are presented here so the compared periods are February 2005, July 2005, February 2006 and July 2006. The thematic maps obtained indicate the most probable sources of pollution in Lake Kastoria and present the geographic distribution of the water quality parameters using the "IDW" algorithm. The most significant drawback of monthly monitoring is the missing of the data influenced by extreme events. Therefore, the need for daily telemetric monitoring data is suggested, in order to prevent environmental hazards and confront pressures concerning on water quality status. Finally, management strategies of pollution reduction are proposed, in combination with systematic telemetric real time monitoring, in order to upgrade the natural environment of Lake Kastoria.

Dewatering Dike Construction and Grouting at the Meadowbank Mine, Northern Canada	GROUTING 2017: JET GROUTING, DIAPHRAGM WALLS, AND DEEP MIXING	Geotechnical Special Publication				5th International Conference on Grouting, Deep Mixing, and Diaphragm Walls	JUL 09-12, 2017	Honolulu, HI	Int Conf Org Grouting, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers Grouting Tech Comm, Geo Inst				Jet grouting and cementitious permeation grouting was carried out as part of the construction of a series of dikes within Second and Third Portage Lakes at Agnico Eagle. s Meadowbank Mine in Nunavut, Canada. The dikes consist of broad rockfill shells, granular filters, and a central low permeability element. The dikes were constructed to permit dewatering of the isolated portions of the lakes to expose areas for development and extraction of ore from open pits. The low permeability elements are comprised of a combination of soil-bentonite and/or cement soil-bentonite cut-off walls that were excavated using slurry trench technology through the granular filters to bedrock or into a dense foundation soil. In deeper portions, where the cut-off wall did not reach bedrock, jet grouting was carried out between the base of the cut-off wall and the bedrock surface. Grouting of the shallow bedrock and the interface between the bedrock and the base of the cut-off wall and/or jet grout columns was then carried out. This paper describes the techniques used for dike construction with emphasis on the treatment of materials left in place beneath the constructed cut-off wall through jet grouting, along with techniques used for permeation grouting of the shallow bedrock and the interface between bedrock and the base of the cut-off wall and/or jet grout wall (i.e., the contact zone). As the earthworks component of the construction was carried out during the short, open water season of each summer, the grouting works were carried out through the winter and shoulder seasons. For this, a significant level of winterization for all equipment had to be employed. The constraints imposed by the necessity of carrying out permeation grouting operations through the Canadian Arctic winter also led to the development of a novel approach to sealing the contact zone. Steel casings were installed through the cut-off wall and jet grout columns to bedrock, and the underlying bedrock drilled and grouted through the bottom of the casings. The casings were then perforated with a casing perforator tool and the contact zone sealed. Based on the successful dewatering and on-going performance of the dikes, the construction and grouting techniques employed are now considered as viable methods in the Canadian Arctic environment. The successful completion of these works would not have been possible without collaboration between the owner, the contractor and the designer.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8080-9				2017		289					102	113																WOS:000406738100011

New and Interesting Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) from Blue Lake Warm Springs, Tooele County, Utah	PHYTOTAXA												Blue Lake Warm Springs is a system of brackish lakes and marshes in western Utah, USA with a unique diatom flora that has been previously documented. Here we reexamine select taxa in greater detail, erecting two new genera and six new species from this system, and describing two additional species not observed in prior studies of the Blue Lake flora. Naviculonema stagnora gen. nov., sp. nov. and Williamsella angusta gen. nov., sp. nov are a new naviculoid genus and new pennate diatom genus lacking a raphe, respectively. Other new species of diatoms from Blue Lake Warm Springs, representing a broad range of diatom diversity, are Cyclotella utahensis sp. nov., Ulnaria tooelensis sp. nov., Pseudostaurosira moralesii sp. nov., Envekadea vanlandinghamii sp. nov., Mastogloia variabilis sp. nov., and Lunella excentrica sp. nov. The report of Envekadea is the first of the genus from inland USA waters, and the report of Lunella is the first from the USA. In addition to describing new taxa in this study, we also closely examine two known taxa, Fallacia pseudolitoricola and Nitzschia vitrea, with scanning electron microscopy, in order to better understand their morphology and biogeography. Presence of euryhaline or salt tolerant taxa in this inland ecosystem may be due to introductions by humans, either via escaped aquaculture species or transport by recreational SCUBA diving.																			1179-3155	1179-3163				DEC 13	2013	153	1					1	38																WOS:000328321600001
J	ARP, G				ARP, G			LACUSTRINE BIOHERMS, SPRING MOUNDS, AND MARGINAL CARBONATES OF THE RIES-IMPACT-CRATER (MIOCENE, SOUTHERN GERMANY)	FACIES												The petrographic investigation of the Miocene Ries-lake-carbonates gave rise to a modified DUNHAM-scheme for classifying non-marine carbonates. If the fabric is not exclusively the result of hydromechanical or biogenic effects, DUNHAM-terms were extended by interpretative attributes describing processes responsible for the secondary fabric development (pedogenesis, early meteoric diagenesis). The lowermost investigated section reveals a distinct zonation of the lake shore during humid stages (carbonates of the infra-, eu-, and supralittoral), interrupted by playa-like interstages of arid conditions (desiccated mudflat). Dolomitic successions of sinter-veneered bioherms, built by green algae and cyanobacteria, form an incomplete 'reef belt' at the northern crater rim. Bioherm sequences were controlled by a seasonally oscillating lake level and fluctuations of higher order, which correspond to small-scale climatic fluctuations in the range of several hundreds to thousands of years. A superposed facies trend is recognized, which is the result of the decreasing eutrophy, alkalinity, and carbonate supersaturation. This reflects the climatic change to generally humid conditions at the end of Miocene. Originally thrombolitic sublacustrine spring mounds were caused by upwelling groundwater from permeable bedrock. Cement framestones of the mound core are considered to result from fabric alteration within the upwelling groundwater and by emersions. Marginal carbonates of the Ries basin, inclusively bioherms, probably were originally Mg-calcitic. Aragonite was restricted to gastropod shells and sublacustrine spring mounds. Dolomitization is interpreted as essentially due to a fluctuating phreatic mixing-zone caused by meteoric groundwater, which underflowed saline water at the soda lake margin. The algal flora comprises cyanobacteria, possible cyanobacteria, green algae, few charophytes, endoliths, and problematic forms. A Recent contamination by endolithic fungi and lichens is evident. Occasionally preserved insect larval tubes, mass accumulations of pupal cases of flies, and arthropod eggs demonstrate that these groups were once a prominent part of the fossil soda lake ecosystem of the Nordlinger Ries.																			0172-9179						1995	33						35	89		10.1007/BF02537444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02537444													WOS:A1995TA21500003
J	Pache, M; Reitner, J; Arp, G				Pache, M; Reitner, J; Arp, G			Geochemical evidence for the formation of a large miocene "travertine" mound at a sublacustrine spring in a Soda Lake (Wallerstein Castle Rock, Nordlinger Ries, Germany)	FACIES												"Travertines" (tufa pinnacles) of the Miocene Riescrater basin have been investigated to test whether carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes can be used for the recognition of fossil subaquatic spring deposits in high-alkalinity settings. The Ries basin "travertines" have so far been interpreted as a product of subaerial to sublacustrine artesian springs discharging calcareous groundwater into a freshwater or slightly saline lake. However, recent studies on microfacies and fabric development propose a formation at Ca2+-supplying sublacustrine springs of a soda lake. Geochemical analysis of "travertines" of the castle rock Wallerstein, including "sickle-cell" limestones, thrombolites, non-skeletal stromatolites, and speleothems, now support the latter interpretation. High Sr contents surpassing that of the contemporaneously formed dolomitic algal bioherms of the lake shore point to an aragonitic composition of primary precipitates. The delta C-13 values of diagenetically moderately to weakly altered "travertine" facies types are in the same range of the impact-brecciated Upper Jurassic limestones, thus, are inconsistent with a mixture of soil-derived CO2 and CO32- from the Jurassic limestones. In addition, the delta O-18 values are too high to support a significant contribution of CO32- by meteoric waters seeping through marine Jurassic limestones. Instead the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values indicate an origin of the CO32- from a lake water body characterized by evaporation. This is consistent with a sodium-rich lake water as indicated by high sodium contents of aragonitic algal bioherms of the lake shore. The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratio of the "travertine" mound carbonates are consistent with calculated mixing of spring waters discharging from the crystalline basement and lake water high in dissolved inorganic carbon. This points to an origin of the divalent cations from sublacustrine spring waters. In turn, Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios of green algal reef carbonates of the take shore are closer to that of the Upper Jurassic carbonates, due to surface run-off from surrounding limestone uplands.																			0172-9179						2001	45						211	230		10.1007/BF02668114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02668114													WOS:000171931000014

Winterkill in Lotic Systems May Be an Important Driver of Amphibian Population Declines	ICHTHYOLOGY AND HERPETOLOGY												Studies of frogs overwintering in ice-covered ponds and lakes have documented large winterkills, suggesting that winter can be a time of great stress and may be a serious threat to rare and endangered frog species that overwinter in these systems. Lotic systems are assumed to be better oxygenated and therefore less subject to overwinter mortality than lentic systems, but few studies of the winter ecology of ranids in stream ecosystems exist. We investigated the habitat use and survival of Columbia Spotted Frogs (Rana luteiventris) overwintering in a stream system in the Toiyabe Mountains of Nevada. We radio-tracked 13 Spotted Frogs from October 2000 to March 2001 to locate hibernacula and document winter habitat use. During the winter, frogs moved up to 191 m under the ice, often upstream against the current. We marked 1,763 frogs from 2000 to 2001 and found evidence of winterkill (population decreases of 66% to 86.5%) at four out of five sites while the fifth site showed no evidence of winterkill. This corresponded to an actual observation of winterkill of 88% of the frogs at one of the sites, making this one of a few studies directly tying observed wintertime mortality to mark-recapture estimates of decreases in ranid populations and the first to do so for amphibians overwintering in a lotic system. Amphibian winter ecology in lotic systems, the severity and frequency of winterkill events in these systems, and their effect on population size and structure is in need of further study over a wide range of species and should be considered in conservation plans for ranids in lotic systems.

We hypothesized that increases of shortwave radiation had increased surface water temperatures and heat fluxes more than had the increases of air temperature. We used the heat flux analyses and the sensitivity analyses to test the hypothesis. The fluxes of solar radiation gradually increased during the study period in a manner consistent with the phenomenon of global brightening. The increase was especially apparent in the spring. The rate of increase of surface water temperature was especially significant in May. Air temperature did not significantly increase in May, but it increased significantly in June (0.40 degrees C decade(-1)). A sensitivity analysis of the heat fluxes at the lake surface (shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, latent heat flux, and sensible heat flux) revealed that surface water temperature was more sensitive to changes of shortwave radiation than to air temperature during the spring. Although other factors such as inflows of groundwater and river water may also have impacted surface water temperatures, the increase of solar radiation appeared to be the major factor responsible for the increase of surface water temperature during the spring in Lake Kasumigaura.

J	Sandsten, H; Beklioglu, M; Ince, Ö				Sandsten, H; Beklioglu, M; Ince, Ö			Effects of waterfowl, large fish and periphyton on the spring growth of Potamogeton pectinatus L. in Lake Mogan, Turkey	HYDROBIOLOGIA												It has been argued that waterfowl and fish may threaten growth of submerged macrophytes, especially in spring during the early growth phase when plant biomass is low. A small reduction of biomass at that time might delay growth or decrease subsequent productivity. We investigated the impact of waterfowl and large fish on the spring growth of fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) by employing an exclosure experiment in the macrophyte-dominated clear-water Lake Mogan, Turkey. Birds and large fish were excluded from eight plots and both in situ vegetation and macrophytes kept in pots were compared to eight open plots. Also, to investigate the effect of periphyton on plant growth it was removed from half of the pot plants. Exclusion of waterfowl and fish may decrease predation on macroinvertebrates, which in turn may affect periphyton, and macrophyte growth, why macroinvertebrates also were sampled. Waterfowl density was high (15-70 ind. of coot, Fulica atra L. ha(-1)), abundance of submerged plants was also high with a surface coverage of 70-80%, and benthivorous fish were present, mainly tench, (Tinca tinca L.) and carp, (Cyprinus carpio L.). Exclusion of waterfowl and large fish did not significantly affect the spring growth of pondweed; neither plants growing in situ nor kept in pots. Removal of periphyton from the plants in the pots did not favour growth. The density of macroinvertebrates was not affected by the exclusion of waterfowl and large fish, but it was positively related to aboveground biomass of fennel pondweed. We suggest that even if waterfowl and large fish are in high densities, their effect on fennel pondweed spring growth in lakes with abundant submerged vegetation, such as Lake Mogan, is low.					beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 15	2005	537						239	248		10.1007/s10750-004-3077-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-3077-2													WOS:000230589900022

Total epilimnetic phosphorus (TP) concentrations were reconstructed quantitatively using a diatom-TP transfer function. Fossil chironomid assemblages were used to support the trophic reconstruction and helped assessing past hypolimnetic oxygen availability. The results indicate eutrophic and anoxic conditions during the Younger Dryas cold period (similar to 12,700-11,600 cal. BP) preceding the present interglacial Throughout the early and mid-Holocene (similar to 11,600-4000 cal. BP) stable oligo- to mesotrophic conditions with diatom-inferred TP values of similar to 20 mu g L-1 prevailed First evidence of increasing Holocene TP is recorded at similar to 3500 cal. BP associated with Bronze Age human impact and for the past 900 years diatoms indicate increasing TP values of 30-60 mu g L-1. During the early Holocene and the past two millennia chironomids indicated anoxic hypolimnetic conditions. The chironomidjouna is considered typical of oligo- to mesotrophic lakes. As a consequence of strongly increased primary production the hypolimnion of Sacrower See became anoxic again during the past 140 years. Our results indicate that highly productive eutrophic conditions can exist prior to cultural eutrophication. At Sacrower See the shift from eutrophic conditions in the Lateglacial to oligo-mesotrophic conditions in the early and mid-Holocene was associated with the climatic warming at the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition. The high productive state during the cold Younger Dryas is associated with changes in seasonality the prolonged winters caused longer ice cover, stronger stratification, anoxia in the hypolimnion, and consequent internal phosphorus loading. During the warm Holocene, however, hypolimnetic anoxia and internal phosphorus loading decreased significantly, resulting in a substantially lower productivity.

Our investigations of living (stained) benthic foraminifera in Maizuru Bay (central Japan) revealed complicated lateral distributions and high temporal variation among common benthic species. Benthic foraminiferal communities in bay environments are often characterized by strong lateral trends in species richness due to frequent fluctuations in the salinity and/or dissolved oxygen content of the hypolimnion. However, our results do not show the existence of similar trends in Maizuru Bay. In fact, the dispersal of opportunistic species during intense coastal winter mixing events may account for this complexity in species diversity and evenness. Sediment trap and plankton tow observations in Lake Nakaumi (southwestern Japan) imply that benthic foraminifera utilize suspended organic matter aggregates as mobile substrates for passive dispersal. Furthermore, we examined three horizons of high fossil benthic foraminiferal abundance in the Aso-kai Lagoon (central Japan) dating to ca. AD 1070, 1400, and 1570, which were nearly coincident with coastal mixing events that were likely caused by enhanced East Asian winter monsoons. Many of the neritic benthic foraminifera in our study region appear to possess high dispersal potential, suggesting that the distribution of opportunistic benthic foraminifera may be useful in inferring the past status of the East Asian winter monsoon.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 31	2019	227								106288	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106288													WOS:000489190500009

Wetland Bird Assemblage in Rural Ponds of Kurukshetra, India	WATERBIRDS												Small sized, man-made, perennial and primarily rain-fed ponds occur widely in the rural landscape of India. These wetlands provide suitable habitats and food resources for a wide variety of resident and migratory wetland birds. Wetland birds in six rural ponds of Kurukshetra District, Haryana, in northern India were surveyed from April 2011 to May 2014 to determine status. Point counts and direct observations were used to record bird species. Sixty-nine species of wetland birds belonging to 47 genera and 20 families were identified. Family Anatidae dominated the avifauna with 20% (n = 14) of the species found. Of the species documented, 54% (n = 37) were winter migrants, 7% (n = 5) were summer migrants and 39% (n = 27) were residents. Among recorded species, Darter (Anhinga melanogaster), Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), Oriental White This ( Threskiornis melanocephalus) and River Tern (Sterna aurantia) are considered as near threatened; Comb Duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus) and Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The occurrence of migrants and special-status species documents the importance of these rural ponds as habitats for wetland birds in India. However, anthropogenic and developmental activities in and around these ponds are posing significant threats. The present study provides baseline information on wetland birds of these ponds for future monitoring, conservation planning and the development of pertinent management interventions.					; RAI, DEEPAK/L-5615-2019; Kumar, Parmesh/JWA-1359-2024	Rai, Dr Deepak/0000-0001-8539-961X; 													1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2016	39	1					86	98		10.1675/063.039.0111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.039.0111													WOS:000372377000010

We examined hydrology and nutrient chemistry from 2015-2017 to 2019 to determine factors affecting periphyton community composition and abundance following a change in the outlet structure and depth of release waters from the major upstream impoundment. The periphyton community composition was abundant and diverse in 2015 and 2016 and lower in 2017 and 2019. Filamentous chlorophytes were dominant in the first 2 years but were sparse in the subsequent years. Cyanophytes were dominant in 2017 and 2019. The expectation entering the study was that altered nutrient chemistry associated with the change in operations resulted in conditions more favorable for periphyton growth. Concentrations of total and soluble phosphorous are independent of reservoir operations, being high in all years because of natural weathering of P-rich volcanic rocks in the basin. Concentrations of TN and DIN were low all study years, resulting in a system that was N-limited, but with similar chemistry among the study years. The hydrology during 2015 and 2016, with abundant chlorophytes, exhibited low flow in the spring, whereas high spring flows were observed in the latter years. We conclude that high spring flows were far more influential in affecting the periphyton community composition in the lower Deschutes River compared to nutrient chemistry.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2022	38	10					1746	1756		10.1002/rra.4041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4041		AUG 2022											WOS:000846497000001

To do this we first review the observed modem spatial pattern of summer precipitation distribution in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) region under different EASM intensities, and the relationship between modern observed delta O-18(p) values and corresponding precipitation amounts on monthly and inter-annual timescales in the EASM and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regions. Second, we compare Holocene lacustrine and marine compound-specific hydrogen isotopic records of n-alkanes/n-alkanoic acid (delta D-n), lacustrine authigenic carbonate and cave stalagmite oxygen isotopic records (delta O-18(c) and delta O-18(s)) from the Asian monsoonal region, all of which are closely related to delta D-p and delta O-18(p) variations. The results demonstrate that in both the ISM and EASM regions, all of these isotopic records exhibit roughly similar long-term characteristics, i.e. they were all more negative during the early-Holocene and early mid-Holocene (ca. 11-6 ka B.P.; B.P. means before present, present = 1950 AD), and then became more positive towards the late-Holocene. Third, we compare representative paleo-humidity records from the Asian monsoonal region; the results confirm that, in the ISM region, a humid interval occurred in the early-Holocene and early mid-Holocene (ca. 11-6 ka B.P.) and subsequently the climate became more arid towards the late-Holocene. This indicates an enhanced ISM during the early-Holocene and early mid-Holocene (ca. 11-6 ka B.P.), and an ISM of decreasing intensity towards the late-Holocene. On a Holocene orbital scale, both delta O-18(p) and Op appear to be controlled by an "amount effect" in the ISM region, consistent with the region's inter-annual modern delta O-18(p) data. This evidence indicates that both delta O-18(p) and delta D-p paleo-records are significantly related to paleo-humidity in the ISM region. In contrast, Holocene humidity variations in the EASM region exhibit clear spatial differences: a humid mid-Holocene interval (ca. 8-3 ka B.P.) occurred in southern and northern China, but an arid interval from ca. 7-3 ka B.P. occurred in central China, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Based on precipitation distribution patterns under different EASM intensities in the EASM region over the past few decades, we conclude that EASM intensity was enhanced during the mid-Holocene (ca. 8-3 ka B.P.). Relative to the ISM intensity, the response of EASM intensity to summer insolation was relatively slow. In the EASM region the relationship between climate and delta O-18(p) and delta D-p is more complex, consistent with analyses of regional inter-annual modern delta O-18(p) data. This evidence demonstrates that both delta O-18(p) and delta D-p paleo-records cannot be used directly as paleo-humidity (i.e. precipitation amount or EASM intensity) indicators in the EASM region. Further comparison and analyses demonstrate that the coupled variations in west-east Equatorial Pacific temperature gradients and the West Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) played an important role in determining EASM intensity during the Holocene.

Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and one of the largest freshwater lake/wetland complexes in Asia. Poyang Lake's associated floodplain wetlands play a critical role for regional and global biodiversity conservation, particularly wintering migratory birds. Since the Three Gorges Dam became operative in 2003, the magnitude and frequency of extreme seasonal water-level fluctuations in Poyang Lake have increased significantly. We review the existing literature and contributions to this Special Issue on the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem and their biota in relation to impacts from the Three Gorges Dam. Resulting impacts on, and adaptations of, Poyang Lake biota to the hydrological changes caused by operation of the dam are poorly understood. Adaptive management of this lake and its associated wetlands needs to be further assessed through comprehensive, long-term monitoring covering a wide range of parameters related to the system's hydrological characteristics, water quality, geomorphology, aquatic biota, wetland vegetation, and associated wetland fauna.

Here we present two pH records spanning the last similar to 12 kyr from well-dated loess-paleosol sections (YWY14 and SHD09) from the NETP. Based on the modified cyclization ratio index (CBT') of the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and regional CBT'-pH empirical relationship, the reconstructed pH values from topmost samples are consistent with the instrumental pH values of the surrounding surface soil. Our results illustrate generally similar pH trends from two loess sections characterized by alkaline conditions from 12.0 to 8.5 cal kyr BP, neutral or acidic during the mid-Holocene and alkaline conditions again during the late Holocene. The intervals of lowest CBT'-derived pH values during the mid-Holocene in our records correlate with those of highest tree pollen percentage from adjacent lake sediments and the regionally weakest aeolian activity from records of paleosol development synthesized from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) in northern China, suggesting a moisture maximum during that period. Taken together, we conclude that CBT'-derived pH variability can be potentially used as an indicator of EASM evolution and the wettest climate occurred during the mid-Holocene in the NETP. The changes in summer precipitation during the Holocene on the NETP can be attributed to the interaction between the mid-latitude westerlies and the EASM circulation.

Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is becoming a valuable tool for evaluating causal relationships in ecological environment studies (EES). However, many studies using PLSSEM often overlook nonlinear relationships and interactions between environmental factors, and have not fully utilized the powerful capabilities of machine learning. Using Gaoyang Lake in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region as a case study, this research presents a framework combining several techniques to better understand the causes of Spring Harmful Algal Blooms (Spring HABs) from 2019 to 2023. The framework uses PLS-SEM to compare and select the optimum causal structure among alternatives, Bayesian Networks (BN) to identify alternative causal pathways, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Polynomial Regression (PR) to uncover interactions and non-linearities among predictors. Our findings indicate that, the BN-generated structure implemented in PLS-SEM had an improved Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score compared to the initial PLS-SEM. No interactions between latent variables were observed using MARS. However, significant non-linearities were identified using PR, and when integrated into the initial PLS-SEM, they produced the optimal model with Q2predict of 0.177, RMSE of 0.967, R2 of 0.421, and BIC of-23.497. Euphotic depth emerged as a critical factor influencing the occurrence of Spring HABs, due to its interaction with the epilimnion depth. Surface nutrient levels (indicated by total phosphorus loadings) and meteorological elements (mean air temperature and sun hours) were identified as the second and third most important latent variables, contributing 25.5 % and 13.5 % to Spring HABs, respectively. This framework is recommended for improving the causal understanding of other site-specific environmental phenomena, providing a scientific basis for more effective environmental management.

Avian migrants encounter higher temperatures but continue to add mass at an inland stopover site in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												As the climate changes, mismatches in phenology between predator and prey species may become more common. For example, many songbirds rely on short peaks in insect and fruit production at stopover sites during migration. Previous research indicates that migratory songbirds are able to modify their departure and arrival dates to some extent despite their reliance on more stable cues such as photoperiod and more stable endogenous factors. However, insect and plant phenology may shift more rapidly with changing climate, reducing foraging opportunities along migratory routes. To quantify changes in songbird arrival patterns at stopover sites during fall migration we analyzed forty years of banding data in nine passerine species commonly captured at banding stations in southwestern Michigan. Weather data revealed that the region has warmed by nearly 2 degrees (C) over this timeframe. For each species, we assessed annual trends in arrival date and temperature at arrival. To determine whether arrival trends impacted stopover site function we also quantified trends in site use and morning mass gain. Arrival dates advanced significantly in three species, and were delayed significantly in three other species. However, air temperature at arrival increased significantly over time for all nine study species. Over the same time period, site use and the pattern of morning mass gain remained stable or increased for all species. Despite the changing climate and the resulting increase in temperature at arrival for migrants, our data indicate that these stopover locations continue to function as a refueling sites. Nonetheless, we must be wary of thresholds and ecological mismatches that may occur if warming trends continue.

A large summer settlement (2 to 5000 ind .cntdot. m-2) and a subsequent high mortality occurred at one station in the period 1972 to 1975; abundance fluctuations at a second station were much smaller. In 1977 densities were very low. The congeneric P. quadrilobata (a species new to Dutch waters) was not observed in 1971-1975, but an average density of 760 ind .cntdot. m-2 (with a biomass of 0.1 g ADW .cntdot. m-2) was found in the lake in April 1977. Its abundance was low in shallow water (< 2.5 m); in the rest (54%) of the lake no preference for depth, substrate or species association could be detected. Seasonal maxima occurred in spring. These opposing population developments can be explained from the different life histories of the two polydorids in combination with a changed seasonal pattern in food supply. The maximum life span of P. quadrilobata was 1 to 1 1/2 years with one main cohort a year. Maximum values for its biomass and density at the stations were 1.42 g ADW .cntdot. m-2 and 6900 ind .cntdot. m-1. Based on reconstructed survivorship curves, annual minimum and maximum values for production were calculated. The (conservative) estimates varied from 0.2 to 2.6 g ADW .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. a-1 for different stations and years, with P/B values varying from 1.5 to 8.2.																			0077-7579					JUN	1987	21	2					143	158		10.1016/0077-7579(87)90029-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(87)90029-9													WOS:A1987J335800006

Lake Ontario ice coverage: Past, present and future	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Ontario ice conditions are statistically linked to regional temperatures recorded in Toronto, during the most recent climate normal (1980/81-2009/10). A metric was developed to capture the net melting effect of average winter temperatures to characterize lake ice conditions, referred to as Net Melting-Degree Days (NMDD). This metric was able to account for 78% of lake ice interannual variability (R-2 = 0.783, P < 0.001). Based on NMDD parameters, current lake ice conditions were characterized in four ways: heavy, moderate, light and very light. Lake Ontario ice conditions were reconstructed to create a hindcast for the span of the instrumental temperature record (1840/41-1979/80). Based on a decadal analysis, heavy ice seasons decreased significantly (R-2 = 0.658, P < 0.001) from the 1840s to the 2000s, declining from an average of 6 heavy ice seasons per decade during the most distant climate normal (1840s to 1960s) to an average of only 1 heavy ice season per decade during the most recent climate normal (1980s to 2000s). Finally, lake ice conditions are projected to the end of the 21st century, using an optimal ensemble of Global Climate Model outputs for two different climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Heavy ice seasons no longer occur as early as the 2050s under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Whereas, very light ice seasons go from being an extreme in the baseline period (10%), to the dominant characterization of Lake Ontario ice conditions by the 2080s, for both RCP4.5 (73%) and RCP8.5 (100%).

Regional contribution of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the fluvial network in a lowland boreal landscape of Quebec	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Boreal rivers and streams are known as hot spots of CO2 emissions, yet their contribution to CH4 emissions has traditionally been assumed to be negligible, due to the spatially fragmented data and lack of regional studies addressing both gases simultaneously. Here we explore the regional patterns in river CO2 and CH4 concentrations (pCO(2) and pCH(4)), gas exchange coefficient (k), and the resulting emissions in a lowland boreal region of Northern Quebec. Rivers and streams were systematically supersaturated in both gases, with both pCO(2) and pCH(4) declining along the river continuum. The k was on average low and increased with stream order, consistent with the hydrology of this flat landscape. The smallest streams (order 1), which represent <20% of the total river surface, contributed over 35% of the total fluvial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The end of winter and the spring thaw periods, which are rarely included in annual emission budgets, contributed on average 21% of the annual GHG emissions. As a whole, the fluvial network acted as significant source of both CO2 and CH4, releasing on average 1.5 tons of C (CO2 eq) yr(-1)km(-2) of landscape, of which CH4 emissions contributed approximately 34%. We estimate that fluvial CH4 emissions represent 41% of the regional aquatic (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) CH4 emissions, despite the relatively small riverine surface (4.3% of the total aquatic surface). We conclude that these fluvial networks in boreal lowlands play a disproportionately large role as hot spots for CO2 and more unexpectedly for CH4 emissions.					; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Campeau, Audrey/0000-0002-9113-8915; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955; Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240													0886-6236	1944-9224				JAN	2014	28	1					57	69		10.1002/2013GB004685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013GB004685													WOS:000332972800005

This site serves as an analogue for possible long-lived springs on Mars. The deployment consisted of landing site-type investigations involving panoramic imagery from which regions of interest and targets of interest were selected for subsequent analysis by close-up imagery, and reflectance and Raman spectroscopy. These data were then used to prioritize samples for caching in the context of sample return. It was found that reflectance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were complementary because they generally identified different minerals and phases. Reflectance spectra of the surfaces of whole rocks often differed from bulk powders of the same samples. Powdering of samples generally reduced the spectral contributions of the surface and grain coatings, allowing the identity of the "bulk rock" to be better determined. Raman spectra of powdered bulk samples were generally featureless due to induced fluorescence. Both spectroscopic techniques were equally effective at detecting biology at the site (cyanobacteria/chlorophyll). Biological activity could also be inferred from the crenulated texture of cyanobacterial mats. Post-deployment analysis of the samples was used to confirm and expand mineral identities, largely by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and elemental analysis. Mineral abundances, presence of phases undetectable by spectroscopy and XRD, and the pervasive presence of Fe oxyhydroxides could be addressed by X-ray fluorescence and wet chemistry. The deployment also provided valuable operational experience for current and next-generation planetary researchers. Overall, the results suggest that multiple analytical techniques, being the XRD, XRF, reflectance and Raman spectroscopy are highly complementary in exploring and characterizing a biology-hosting hypersaline springs environment. This work provides a framework for the value of different instruments for exploring similar sites on Mars, as the instrument from our field campaign have equivalents on the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers.

Hydrological connections between different water bodies and the influence of thawing permafrost (ground ice) are not well understood on the QTP. This study applied water stable isotopic method to investigate the permafrost hydrological variabilities in Beiluhe Basin (BLB) on Central QTP. Isotopic variations of precipitation, river flow, thermokarst lake, and near-surface ground ice were identified to figure out the moisture source of them, and to elaborate the hydrological connections in permafrost region. Results suggested that isotopic seasonalities in precipitation is evident, it is showing more positive values in summer seasons, and negative values in winter seasons. Stable isotopes of river flow are mainly distributed in the range of precipitation which is indicative of important replenishment from precipitation. delta O-18, delta D of thermokarst lakes are more positive than precipitation, indicating of basin-scale evaporation of lake water. Comparison of delta(I) values in different water bodies shows that hydrology of thermokarst lakes was related to thawing of permafrost (ground ice) and precipitation. Near-surface ground ice in BLB exhibits different isotopic characteristics, and generates a special delta D-delta O-18 relationship (freezing line): delta D = 5.81 delta O-18-23.02, which reflects typical freezing of liquid water. From isotopic analysis, it is inferred that near-surface ground ice was mainly recharged by precipitation and active layer water. Stable isotopic and conceptual model is suggestive of striking hydrological connections between precipitation, river flow, thermokarst lake, and ground ice under degrading permafrost. This research provides fundamental comprehensions into the hydrological processes in permafrost regions on QTP, which should be considered in investigating the influence of thawing permafrost on the hydrological cycle on QTP.

J	Bennike, O; Wagner, B				Bennike, Ole; Wagner, Bernd			Deglaciation chronology, sea-level changes and environmental changes from Holocene lake sediments of Germania Havn So, Sabine O, northeast Greenland	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Germania Havn So is located at the outermost coast of northeastern Greenland. According to radiocarbon dating, the lake basin was deglaciated in the early Holocene, around 11,000 cal yr BP. At that time the lake was a marine bay, but the lake was isolated soon after deglaciation at similar to 10,600 cal yr BP. The marine fauna was species-poor, indicating harsh conditions with a high sedimentation rate and lowered salinity due to glacial meltwater supply. The pioneer,vegetation around the lake was dominated by mosses and herbs. Deposition of relatively coarse sediments during the early Holocene indicates erosion of the newly deglaciated terrain. Remains of the first woody plant (Salix herbacea) appear at 7600 cal yr BP and remains of other woody plants (Salix arctica, Dryas octopetala, Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum nigrum) appear around one millennium later. Declining concentrations of D. octopetala and the caddis fly Apatania zonella in the late Holocene probably imply falling summer temperatures. Only moderate changes in the granulometric and geochemical record during the Holocene indicate relatively stable environmental settings in the lake, which can probably be explained by its location at the outer coast and the buffering effect of the neighboring ocean.

J	STATES, JB				STATES, JB			LOCAL ADAPTATIONS IN CHIPMUNK (EUTAMIAS-AMOENUS) POPULATIONS AND EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL AT SPECIES BORDERS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												A study of 4 yellow pine chipmunk (E. amoenus) populations distributed along a steep environmental gradient in central Oregon [USA] revealed differences verifying a prediction of high evolutionary potential as distributional borders of species occupying unstable environments. Population density was lowest on the coniferous forest edge of the ponderosa pine transition zone (Sisters population), highest near the center of the transition zone (Main Grid), and intermediate in populations at the desert periphery of the ponderosa zone (Cabin Lake) and isolated in a disjunct ponderosa forest on the Oregon High Desert (Lost Forest). Attrition of adult .male..male. was greatest during the oversummer periods, and was more likely due to predation than to dispersal. Attrition of adult .female..female. was greatest during the overwinter periods. During this period, winter food caches may be exhausted before new supplies appear; these shortages, combined with increases in .female. energy demand associated with gestation and rearing of young, may have contributed to overwinter starvation. Significantly higher adult .female. body weight at the edge of the dense coniferous forest suggests an adaptive response to spring food shortages caused by late snowpacks and by cool weather inhibition of foraging. At the desert edge of the ponderosa forest, increased body weight may instead be an adaptive response to spring food shortages resulting from fewer seed-producers and from competition with least chipmunks (E. minimus). Observations at the Main Grid, Cabin Lake and Lost Forest showed behavioral characteristics of the populations to be generally similar, although significant populational differences in activity budgeting were observed. When foraging, individuals from all populations oriented most strongly toward shrubs, then open ground, slash piles and trees; they oriented least strongly toward rocks, stumps or logs. Chipmunks involved in maintenance or protective activities showed a nearly reversed order of preference for the same habitat features. Presently observed lines of contact between allopatric chipmunk species probably do not represent dynamic tension zones established and maintained in delicate balance by aggressive interactions. They represent extremely stable distributional limits established through habitat selection as a mechanism by which smaller species may avoid fruitless as well as energetically costly competitive encounters with larger species.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1976	46	3					221	256		10.2307/1942254	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942254													WOS:A1976CK20400001

Hypoxia constrains behavioral responses to chemical alarm cues by fathead minnows Pimephales promelas	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Hypoxia is a seasonally recurring environmental condition in small temperate lakes during summer thermal stratification and under ice cover in winter. Anthropogenic eutrophication contributes significantly to hypoxia by increasing primary production of organic materials that subsequently decompose in the hypolimnion. Greenhouse gas emissions that increase global temperatures will reduce the capacity of water to hold dissolved gases such as oxygen and increase the duration of thermal stratification and thus increase the severity and duration of hypoxic conditions in temperate lakes. How hypoxia may impact assessment of predation risk is under-studied. Here, we present a test of the effect of low dissolved oxygen (similar to 1 ppm) on antipredator behavioral responses to conspecific alarm cues by fathead minnows. When alarm cues derived from conspecific epidermal tissues were introduced, fish under normoxic conditions (similar to 9 ppm) reduced activity and moved out of the water column to spend more time at the bottom. These behaviors serve to reduce the probability of predation. At low dissolved oxygen levels, fathead minnows engaged in aquatic surface respiration, i.e., "drinking" the surface film of oxygen-rich water. When alarm cues were introduced, minnows left the surface waters to dash briefly downward but soon returned to the surface and did not reduce their activity. Taken together, these data indicate that under oxygen stress, minnows engage in truncated antipredator responses and remain near the surface where they would be more vulnerable to avian predators or air-breathing invertebrates such as belastomatids. Through decreased availability of dissolved oxygen, global climate change is likely to disrupt predator-prey interactions in temperate lakes.

Using citizen science monitoring data in species distribution models to inform isotopic assignment of migratory connectivity in wetland birds	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Stable isotopes have been used to estimate migratory connectivity in many species. Estimates are often greatly improved when coupled with species distribution models (SDMs), which temper estimates in relation to occurrence. SDMs can be constructed using point locality data from a variety of sources including extensive monitoring data typically collected by citizen scientists. However, one potential issue with SDM is that these data often have sampling bias. To avoid this potential bias, we created SDMs based on marsh bird monitoring program data collected by citizen scientists and other participants following protocols specifically designed to maximize detections of species of interest at locations representative of larger areas of inference. We then used the SDMs to refine isotopic assignments of breeding areas of autumn-migrating and wintering sora Porzana carolina, Virginia rail Rallus limicola, and yellow rail Coturnicops noveboracensis based on feathers collected from individuals caught at various locations in the United States from Minnesota south to Louisiana and South Carolina. Sora were assigned to an area that included much of the western U.S. and prairie Canada, covering parts of the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi waterfowl Flyways. Yellow rails were assigned to a broad area along Hudson and James Bay in northern Manitoba and Ontario, as well as smaller parts of Quebec, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including parts of the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways. Virginia rails were from several discrete areas, including parts of Colorado, New Mexico, the central valley of California, and southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the Pacific and Central Flyways. Our study demonstrates extensive data from organized citizen science monitoring programs are especially useful for improving isotopic assignments of migratory connectivity in birds, which can ultimately lead to better informed management decisions and conservation actions.

In the aqueous phase, sulfonamides (2.64-344 ng L-1), lincomycin (ND to 53.8 ng L-1) and florfenicol (0.15-963 ng L-1) were the main compounds with high concentrations and detection frequencies. In the sedimentary phase, fluoroquinolones (ND to 174 ng g(-1), dry weight) and tetracyclines (ND to 39.6 ng g(-1), dry weight) were the predominant compounds. Antibiotic concentrations in Lake Taihu were generally lower relative to data documented in previous studies on China and other countries. The composition of antibiotics showed that livestock wastewater might be the main source of antibiotics in Lake Taihu, followed by domestic wastewater. Antibiotics in the lake water showed slight spatial variation in summer and significant spatial variation in winter; whereas, antibiotic concentrations in the sediments varied obviously, with high concentrations found in the sites close to potential pollution sources. Mass balance showed that sediments are an important sink and potential source for fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines. In addition to antibiotics' physicochemical properties, the spatiotemporal distribution of antibiotics in the lake was influenced by both pollution sources and lake hydrodynamics. The environmental risk assessment results showed that sulfamethoxazole could pose high risks on the algae in the aquatic ecosystem, followed by tetracyclines (algae) and fluoroquinolones (bacteria). Overall, our study reveals complex compositions and clear spatiotemporal dynamics in Lake Taihu, which were the consequence of pollution sources and lake hydrodynamics.

In this study, we sampled cyanobacteria from volcanic lakes and hot springs of the North Atlantic S. Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), and identified them using a molecular approach. Cyanobacteria were also scanned for the presence of toxigenicity using specific primers targeting genes involved with toxin production. Sequences of 16S rDNA were related to six genera: Microcoleus, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, Microcystis, Pseudanabaena, and Gloeothece, being similar to those of other volcanic areas in Mexico, Australia and Hawaii. In some of the samples, genes responsible for the production of the toxins microcystin, cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin were identified, indicating the potential toxicity of the species.

The Role of Biotic and Abiotic Interactions in Summer Diapause in Cyclopoids: Conceptual Model and Field Validation in Southern Quebec Boreal Lakes	DORMANCY IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS. THEORY, HUMAN USE AND MODELING	Monographiae Biologicae											Cyclopoid copepods are a dominant component of freshwater zooplankton and the Cyclopidae is the most diverse family. Dormancy is a fundamental process of cyclopoid life history in permanent lakes and temporary ponds. In boreal lakes, cyclopoid diapause has been documented mainly in Northern Europe but more rarely in Northern America. We present the first assessment on summer diapausing cyclopoids (SDC) in 22 boreal lakes in southern Quebec, which vary in their morphometry, tropic status, and predation pressure by fish or invertebrates. We developed a conceptual model to test the hypothesis that diapausing patterns of SDC in boreal lakes are a complex response depending primarily on morphometric and trophic features and secondly on the intensity of hypolimnetic anoxia and predation by fish or invertebrates. Using morphometric indices, lakes were classified in groups varying by the importance of wind-mixing, the strength of thermal stratification during summer, the potential of meromixis, and the risk of predation by fish or chaoborids. Three cyclopoid species (Diacyclops thomasi, Cyclops scutifer, Mesocyclops edax) dominated in all groups of lakes, while Diacyclops nanus and Acanthocyclops vernalis were found in small abundance and only in few lakes. The highest abundances of SDC (density and biomass) were found in sediments of thermally stratified mesotrophic lakes with intermediate wind-mixing index (Ko) and low potential for meromixis (Pm). Strong positive correlations were found between SDC and meiobenthos abundances in all groups of lakes. High biomass of Chaoborus larvae or presence of large populations of fish negatively affected SDC abundances in meiobenthos. Morphometric features, wind-mixing and thermal stratification, as well as the abundance of Chaoborus and fish predators are the key factors governing species diversity and abundance of summer diapausing cyclopoids in boreal lakes.					; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019; alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; 													0077-0639		978-3-030-21213-1; 978-3-030-21212-4				2019	92						221	246		10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_14	10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1												WOS:000553031200015

Trade-Offs Between Forage Availability, Accessibility, and Predation Risk on Winter Foraging Strategies of Wood Bison (Bison bison athabascae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Optimal foraging theory (OFT) and the energy maximization hypothesis (EMH) have long been essential when examining wildlife habitat selection. At high latitudes and altitudes, animals in winter face greater limitations in availability and accessibility of forage. Here we explore the foraging behavior of wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) during winter within the Ronald Lake bison herd in northeastern Alberta, Canada, and examine the trade-offs they face due to limitations in forage abundance and availability (snow conditions), as well as the need to minimize predation risk. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) location data collected from 70 female wood bison to identify winter foraging sites and craters selected by bison to access forage beneath the snow. Within wetlands used by bison we selected 190 pairs of used (foraged) and random (available) sites to test eight a priori hypotheses explaining how bison traded-off between forage availability, accessibility, and minimizing predation risk. We found with matched-paired logistic regression that Carex atherodes was 1.21-times more likely to be selected per unit increase in ground cover, compared to 1.17-times per unit ground cover for C. aquatilis and C. utriculata. However, all Carex species showed an increase in selection when cover was > 50% cover within individual craters. While the importance of Carex was clear, forage site selection was still inversely related to snow depth. There is also a neutralizing combined effect of snow depth and Carex species ground cover which suggests that bison maximized their energy return by avoiding areas with deep snow (> 30 cm) that demanded intensive cratering, even when highly selected forage was accessible beneath. Avoidance of forage areas with deep snow demonstrates that wood bison employed a foraging strategy that considers both forage availability and environmental conditions, with snow depth being a limiting factor. We highlight the relationship between optimal foraging based on food availability and the trade-offs within an energy restrictive winter season, furthering the understanding of how large herbivores forage strategically to maximize energy intake in northern environments.

Stratigraphic evidence for these deep lava-dammed lakes is expectedly sparse. Possible lacustrine deposits at six areas in the eastern canyon yielded no compelling evidence for sediment deposited in a deep lake. At two of the sites the sediment was associated with late Quaternary spring-fed pools and marshes. Water-lain silt and sand at lower Havasu Creek was deposited similar to3000 cal yr ago. The deposit contains an ostracode assemblage similar to that living in the modern travertine-dammed pools adjacent to the outcrop. The second deposit, at Lees Ferry, formed in a spring-fed marsh similar to43,000 cal yr ago, as determined by C-14 and amino acid geochronology. It contains abundant ostracode and mollusk fossils, the richest assemblages reported from the Grand Canyon to date. Our interpretation of these sediments as spring-fed deposits, and their relative youth, provides an alternative to the conventional view that deposits like these were formed in deep lava-dammed lakes that filled the Grand Canyon.

Phytoplankton productivity and size composition in Lake Simcoe: The nearshore shunt and the importance of autumnal production	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Primary production by phytoplankton helps fuel hypolimnetic oxygen depletion as well as food web productivity, and is thought to have been affected by dreissenid mussel colonization in Lake Simcoe. Measured by short-term C-14 uptake, areal and volumetric rates of photosynthetic carbon uptake (production) were lower in nearshore (<15 m) than offshore sites during the study period (Aug. 2010-Aug. 2011). Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were also lower at nearshore sites, except in summer (June-Aug.). Production increased from May to an annual maximum in September (350 mg C m(-2) d(-1) nearshore and 650 mg C m(-2) d(-1) offshore) and remained high through November; its annual minimum (<10 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) was in February. A secondary spring maximum occurred in April in the offshore (450 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) but not the nearshore (30 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Chl a and production of net phytoplankton (>20 mu m) was greatest from August through November at offshore sites (median contribution >35% of total) but was much less at nearshore sites (median contribution <10%). Production and Chl a were dominated by nanoplankton (2-20 mu m), with median contributions >40% in most seasons. The lower production at nearshore than offshore sites supports previous inferences that dreissenid mussels have caused differential loss of planktonic primary production, especially of net phytoplankton, in nearshore waters. The results from Lake Simcoe are consistent with evidence from other lakes that dreissenids can have major impacts on seasonal blooms of diatoms as the mussels continue to spread within and among North American lakes.

A total of 31 lake trout and 73 white suckers were given a single I.P. injection of 7 mug.g-1 of toxaphene between May 1988 and September 1988. A further 20 lake trout were injected with 3.5 mug.g-1 of toxaphene between May 1989 and September 1989. Fish were tagged with individually coded tags, weighed, measured and released back into the lake. Fish were recaptured during spring (white sucker) and fall (lake trout) spawning runs in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. Meristic data were taken and a subsample was sacrificed for residue analyses. Depuration of toxaphene from both species was observed with half lives for total toxaphene of 524, 232 and 322 days for white suckers and the two doses in lake trout respectively. Half-lives in lake trout and white suckers for total toxaphene and for two of the more persistent components, octachlorobonane, T2, and nonachlorbornane T12, indicate that significant differences in species ability to eliminate toxaphene. The data also indicate that differences may exist in the half-lives of these components of toxaphene within a species.

Radiocarbon ages of clam shells suggest that Niagara Falls migrated very slowly around the narrowed gorge section at Niagara Glen from 10,500 to 5500 yr B.P., when upper Great Lakes water bypassed Lake Erie and flowed to the Ottawa River via the outlet at North Bay, Ontario. Prior to that interval, river discharge and recession rates were similar to those at present, and similar rates resumed after 5200 yr B.P. By about 4500 yr B.P., the present gorge had intersected a buried gorge of the pre-late Wisconsinan Niagara River (St. Davids Gorge). The sediment derived from the excavated buried valley fill may be present as a distinct marker horizon in the sediments in southwestern Lake Ontario.

J	Sierra, EC; Daniel, LR				Sierra, Cagle E.; Daniel, Roelke L.			Relative roles of fundamental processes underpinning PEG dynamics in dimictic lakes as revealed by a self-organizing, multi-population plankton model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The longstanding PEG (Phytoplankton Ecology Group) qualitative/conceptual model describes generalized seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in temperate lakes and suggests important mechanisms driving these processes. In the research presented here, we re-created the conceptual PEG dynamics using a novel mechanistic numerical plankton model. The numerical model incorporates only a handful of interacting factors and biological rules. Key model features include seasonally variable temperature, mixing depth, and light, dynamic zooplankton and phytoplankton populations, and multiple dynamic nutrient concentrations. The model design is unique in that it incorporates a population-rich phytoplankton assemblage where life-history traits of members are based on ecological principles (trade-offs between traits), allowing the assemblage to organize over time based on nutrient competition and grazing. Using 50th year solutions to the model solved with fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, i.e., a period when the dynamics had reached stable non-equilibrium states, sensitivity analyses were run by individually varying model parameters +/- 50% and comparing the effect on model responses of interest. Simulation analyses revealed the important role light and temperature limitation played both early and late in the year controlling plankton biomass. Trade-offs in phytoplankton life-history characteristics determined the composition of the spring bloom under non-nutrient limiting conditions (fast-growing, edible populations dominated) and the post clear-water phase assemblage under low nutrient conditions (slower-growing, less-edible populations dominated). Grazer characteristics, specifically rate of grazing and spring "emergence", determined the occurrence of the clear-water phase and influenced the post assemblage composition, where a clear-water phase was absent when the grazing rate was low or spring emergence absent, and the highly inedible populations were lost from the assemblage. Hydraulic flushing also played an important role where diminished inflow led to higher richness, evenness and diversity due to greater overwintering of less-edible taxa, which influenced phytoplankton composition during spring bloom, diminishing secondary productivity. These results increase understanding of the relative roles of fundamental mechanisms structuring natural aquatic ecosystems and reinforce the significance of key biotic and abiotic system components of temperate lakes.

J	McCall, J				McCall, Joseph			Lake Bogoria, Kenya: Hot and warm springs, geysers and Holocene stromatolites	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												I carried out the first regional geological survey of the central Gregory Rift Valley in Kenya in 1958-60, and review here the numerous subsequent specialised studies focused on the unique endoreic Lake Bogoria (formerly Hannington), studies which embraced the sedimentology of the Holocene sediments around the lake shores, the hot-spring and geyser activities and the coring of the sediments beneath the lake. I focus on the occurrences of stromatolites in a hydrothermal environment, both in two closely spaced late Holocene (similar to 4500 yr BP) generations at the lake margin, associated with algae and cyanobacteria, which represent a final more humid climatic phase after the several interglacial more humid phases (also represented by stromatolite occurrences in other rift valley lakes); and also at present being formed, at the edge of the now highly saline lake, in the very hot springs in association with thermophilic bacteria and with silica. I briefly mention the older occurrences in Lake Magadi to the south, which are quite different; and form three generations; and also present-day occurrences of stromatolites in a flood-plain environment, unlike the present-day environment at Lake Bogoria. Other stromatolite occurrences are mentioned, around Lake Turkana and the former lake in the Suguta River valley to the north. I suggest that the hot waterfall at Kapedo, at the head of the Suguta River, and the central island of Ol Kokwe (with hot springs, amidst the fresh water lake Baringo) could well be investigated for stromatolite occurrences. Lake Bogoria, an empty wilderness occupied only by flamingos when I mapped it, is now more accessible and provides a unique open-air laboratory for such researches, but like all the Rift Valley lakes, is unique, sui generis. Results of detailed investigations of the type reviewed here, can only be applied to other occurrences of stromatolites elsewhere in the rift system or beyond the rift system with reservation.

Age-0 black crappie catch per unit effort (CPUE) was only > 5.0/min when yellow perch CPUE was < 0.1/min. Age-0 yellow perch CPUE was only > 0.1/min when black crappie CPUE was < 5.0/min. We also found that the CPUE for both species was relatively low compared to other South Dakota waters and concluded that the relation between black crappie and yellow perch was probably not simply interspecific competition. Therefore, we assessed climatological variables to help explain this relation. In general, crappie CPUE was negatively correlated with precipitation and positively correlated with mean daily temperature difference and mean wind speed. Conversely, CPUE for perch was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with mean daily temperature difference and mean wind speed. Although these are not necessarily cause-and-effect relations, age-0 yellow perch were most abundant during years with more precipitation, less wind and less variation in daily temperatures in Brant Lake, whereas age-0 black crappie were most abundant during years with less precipitation, more wind and greater daily variation in temperature.

Short-term incubations were necessary to avoid induction of nitrate uptake or changes in the rates of NH4+ uptake that occurred in long-term incubations. Uptake rates of nitrate are slow most of the summer. Since the nitrate is also present in low concentrations, most of the summer regeneration of nitrate must be very slow. The slow turnover of particulate N, low nutrient concentrations, slow rate of uptake relative to their ability to take up N, and the high affinity for NH3 (low Kt [uptake constant]) suggest that in the summer, the primary productivity of the Lower Great Lakes is restricted by N deficiency.

The seasonal distribution of PH3 in marsh and paddy fields were observed. Positive PH3 fluxes are significantly related to high air temperature (summer season) and increased vegetation. It is concluded that vegetation speeds up the liberation of PH3 from soils, while water coverage might function as a diffusion barrier from soils or sediments to the atmosphere. The concentrations of atmospheric PH3 (ng m(-3)) above different wetlands decrease in the order of paddy fields (51.8 +/- 3.1) > marsh (46.5 +/- 20.5) > lake (37.0 +/- 22.7) > coastal wetland (1.71 +/- 0.73). Highest atmospheric PH3 levels in marsh are found in summer. In paddy fields, atmospheric PH3 concentrations in flourishing stages are higher than those in slowly growing stages.

In this study, we present it as proof of a new concept to verify fluid pathways beneath lakes integrating the structure of the geothermal reservoir into the surrounding tectonic frame. We recognized dextral faults fracturing inherited volcanic formations and thus generating highly permeable zones beneath the lake. At intersection points of faults, reservoir fluids discharge from deep holes as imaged by the high-resolution bathymetry at the bottom of the Narli Lake. Onshore, the tectonic setting also generates both extensional and compressional structures. Extensional structures result in extensive fluid discharge through hot springs while compressional structures do not discharge any fluid. The water of the lake as well as in the hot springs is highly saline and has relatively high concentrations of Cl, HCO3, SO4, Na, Ca, Mg, and Si. In several hot springs, we observed mixtures of high-saline fluids having a deep origin and low-saline shallow groundwater. We observed discharge into the lake by gas bubbles, which contain probably CO2 or H2S. Mineral precipitation indicates a carbonatic source at the lake bottom and along the shoreline. Extensive travertine precipitation also occurs near hot springs along the nearby extensional zone of Ihlara Valley. In summary, the composition of fluids and minerals is controlled by water-rock interaction through the volcanic and carbonatic rocks beneath this volcanic lake.					; Bulut, Fatih/ABC-4781-2020	Brehme, Maren/0000-0003-1862-2767; 													2045-2322					APR 22	2021	11	1							8773	10.1038/s41598-021-87743-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87743-5								33888763					WOS:000642742500062

The focus is on southern South America. Statistical downscaling models are derived from observational data and applied to the simulations to estimate precipitation in south-eastern Patagonia during the MH. These estimates are compared with lake level estimates for Laguna Potrok Aike (LPA) from sediments. Relative to pre-industrial conditions (i.e. 1550-1850), which show extraordinarily high lake levels, the proxy-based reconstructed lake levels during the MH are lower. The downscaled simulated circulation differences indicate higher LPA precipitation during the MH from March to August, higher annual means, and reduced precipitation from September to February. Thus the reconstructed lower LPA lake levels can not be explained solely by the simulated precipitation changes. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Based on proxy data from southern South America hypotheses have also been proposed on the latitudinal position of the southern hemispheric westerlies (SHWs). In agreement with some of these hypotheses our simulations show an increased seasonal cycle of the latitudinal position of the SHWs during the MH, which can be explained by the orbital forcing. The simulations also show stronger SHWs over southern Patagonia during austral summer and weaker SHWs during winter. The downscaling model associates weaker SHWs with increased precipitation in the LPA region. However, this relationship is only moderate, and therefore the downscaling model does not support the assumption of a strong link between mean SHWs and precipitation over south-eastern Patagonia, which is the basis of many proxy-based hypotheses about the SHWs.					; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020; Widmann, Martin/P-5178-2015; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Ohlendorf, Christian/0000-0003-3794-7313; Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Wagner, Sebastian/0000-0001-5603-3897; Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963; Widmann, Martin/0000-0001-5447-5763; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808; Jones, Julie/0000-0003-2892-8647; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2007	29	4					333	355		10.1007/s00382-007-0229-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-007-0229-x													WOS:000247929300001
J	Fedorov-Davydov, DG				Fedorov-Davydov, DG			Respiration activity in tundra biocenoses and soils of the Kolyma Lowland	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The rate of CO2 efflux increases from waterlogged to drained sites in soil catenas. It ranges from 9-47 to 33-224 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour in the soils of alas depressions, from 16-68 to 76-253 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour in flood-plain soils, and from 142 to 324-431 mg C-CO2/m(2) per hour (daytime data) in the soils of polygonal bogs at different stages of plant successions. Along this landscape gradient, the share of soil respiration in the total efflux of CO2 from the ecosystem increases as well as the role of soil microorganisms in this process. Data scattering in particular sites is conditioned by spatial heterogeneity of the soil cover; lower values are characteristic of the waterlogged loci with suppressed microbiological activity, on one hand, and retarded gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere, on the other. Calculated values of annual carbon release from the ecosystems of automorphic tundra and bog of the lake depression reached 402 and 203 g C-CO2/m(2), respectively (data of 1990). The input of soil respiration to the net emission of carbon from these ecosystems constituted 144 and 105 g C-CO2/m(2), respectively. The losses during the autumn-winter period reached 5.6% and 18.7% of annual losses, respectively.

In 1994 it formed a large bloom (6000 filaments ml(-1)) that caused high turbidity (up to 7 NTU), which is attributed mainly to light scattering by gas vesicles. When lake water was pumped into the high-pressure pipe (2.5 MPa) of the Israeli National Water Carrier (INWC) the turbidity of the water decreased by 65%, the Aphanizomenon filaments lost their buoyancy and some filaments fragmented. Application of 0.6 MPa pressure to cultures of the Lake Kinneret strain of A. ovalisporum in a pressure nephelometer caused collapse of all gas vesicles; the turbidity decreased by 80% and all of the filaments sedimented. The mean critical collapse pressure of the gas vesicles (p(c)) was 0.58 +/- 0.02 MPa (with cells suspended in hypertonic sucrose solution), the apparent mean critical collapse pressure (p(a)) was 0.27 +/- 0.02 MPa (with cells suspended in culture medium) and the mean turgor pressure (p(t)) was 0.33 +/- 0.02 MPa, The value of p(a) is lower than the pressures in any of the five high-pressure pipes (0.6-2.5 MPa) along the INWC. It is concluded that gas vesicle collapse caused the observed decrease in turbidity in the system. The combined physical, chemical and biological treatments given in the INWC system resulted in a 99.9% decrease in the A. ovalisporum biomass. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This plant forms dense, extensive beds that can interfere with recreational activities. Eurasian watermilfoil has been shown in laboratory experiments to cause mortality or low growth rates to several species of cyanobacteria, because of allelopathic molecules (fatty acids, polyphenols) released into the water by the plant. The allelopathic effect of Eurasian watermilfoil has never been studied in a natural setting. The main objective of this study was to verify whether a causal link between Eurasian watermilfoil and cyanobacteria could be established in two infested lakes of southern Qu & eacute;bec, Canada. Some fatty acids or polyphenols (ellagic, nonanoic, octadecenoic and oleic acids) were detected in summer and autumn in the water, but in concentrations well below (30 to 35,000 times lower) the theoretical concentrations at which they reduce the growth of cyanobacteria. There was no evidence of allelopathic effects of Eurasian watermilfoil on the cyanobacterial assemblages. Other chemical and physical factors likely had greater influences on cyanobacterial assemblage composition than Eurasian watermilfoil, notably phosphorus concentration and water temperature. However, some cyanobacterial species known to be influenced by Eurasian watermilfoil, in particular Microcystis aeruginosa, were not specifically identified in this study, so caution must be exercised before concluding that there is no allelopathic effect.

Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of ambulatory care visits and hospitalizations among children. Because of overlapping signs and symptoms and expensive and inefficient testing methods, the etiology of pediatric diarrhea is rarely established. Methods. We identified children < 18 years of age who were evaluated for diarrhea at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, between October 2010 and September 2012. Stool specimens submitted for testing were evaluated by using the FilmArray gastrointestinal diagnostic system, which is a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction platform that can simultaneously detect 23 bacterial, viral, and protozoal agents. Results. A pathogen was detected in 561 (52%) of 1089 diarrheal episodes. The most commonly detected pathogens included toxigenic Clostridium difficile (16%), diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (15%), norovirus GI/GII (11%), and adenovirus F 40/41 (7%). Shiga toxin-producing E coli were detected in 43 (4%) specimens. Multiple pathogens were identified in 160 (15%) specimens. Viral pathogens (norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus) were more common among children < 5 years old than among those 5 to 17 years old (38% vs 16%, respectively; P < .001). Bacterial pathogens were identified most commonly in children 2 to 4 years of age. Children with 1 or more underlying chronic medical conditions were less likely to have a pathogen identified than those without a chronic medical condition (45% vs 60%, respectively; P < .01). Viral pathogens were detected more commonly in the winter, whereas bacterial pathogens were detected more commonly in the summer. Conclusions. Toxigenic C difficile, diarrheagenic E coli, and norovirus were the leading organisms detected among these children with diarrhea. Viral pathogens are identified frequently among young children with acute gastroenteritis.

Hourly to weekly variations in halite precipitation from the hypersaline Dead Sea: The role of evaporation, water cooling and freshwater plume stability	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Thick-bedded halite sequences in the geological record are characterized by lateral variations, reflecting spatiotemporal variations in environmental forcing. Although temporal variations have been examined over seasonal scales or longer durations, there is a paucity of information regarding the dynamics of halite deposition at shorter durations of days and hours. Additionally, the influence of water discharges and surface salinity gradients remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, in situ, hourly to weekly halite accumulation rates were measured on the Dead Sea floor (ca 20 m water depth), the only modern deep and hypersaline water body. Novel underwater photography methods were developed to directly observe halite precipitation at the lake floor, coeval with monitoring of the environmental drives, i.e. evaporation, meteorological and limnological conditions. Two fundamental environments were explored: a diluted plume environment arising from spring discharge; and a mixed hypersaline environment. The focus was on deposition during winter when the halite accumulation rate is highest, and the relationship between evaporation and halite accumulation is most straightforward since the water column is vertically uniform. Significant spatial variations in halite accumulation were found between the two environments, along with hourly variations in each environment. In the mixed hypersaline environment, over intra-diurnal timescales, evaporation plays a more significant role in halite precipitation, whereas temperature has a greater impact on seasonal changes. In the diluted plume environment, the stability of the buoyant plume controls the rate of halite deposition; during windstorms, the plume is stirred, with higher surface water salinity and higher rate of halite accumulation. However, under calm winds, the plume is stable, with diluted surface water, and the rate of halite accumulation is a few times lower. Following these new findings, the implications for the interpretation of halite deposits are discussed.

High-resolution hydrodynamic modelling to study year-round circulations and inter-basin exchanges in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A new high-resolution (500 x 500 m), three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was applied to Lake Winnipeg to study summer and winter water circulation, temperature, and ice-cover during 2016-17. The model was run with a combination of buoy-based observations and the outputs from the Global Environmental Multiscale model forcing. Four primary riverine inflows and two outflows were considered in the model. The bathymetry from a previous study by the authors was revised using a 2018 survey covering the South Basin and the Narrows. Comparisons of this new model with the previous model setup (2 km resolution) show noticeable improvements in all simulated parameters. In the Narrows, where seiche-driven flows have predominant oscillation periods of similar to 27 h and similar to 17 h, the RMSE of simulated currents is 0.1ms(-1), half of that of the previous simulations. The new model was able to reasonably simulate the spatial development of ice-cover over the lake. The ice-free period circulation results show that there are two clockwise and counterclockwise gyres in the North Basin, and a weak seasonal clockwise gyre in the South Basin. Monthly circulation patterns differ from those during short wind events due to spatiotemporal variability of wind patterns. The materials from the Red and the Winnipeg Rivers need similar to 50 days to reach the Narrows before transported from the South Basin to the North Basin. The daily inter-basin exchange flow oscillations during the ice-free period can range up to similar to 3.5 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1), while under-ice daily exchanges are always northwards with values depending on inflowing riverine discharge up to similar to 0.5 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1).

Dechlorane plus and other flame retardants in tree bark from the Northeastern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Previous work has shown that certain parts of the Great Lakes region are polluted with Dechlorane Plus (DP), a highly chlorinated flame retardant that was used as a replacement for Dechlorane/Mirex. It was suspected that a source of DP to the environment might be its manufacturing facility located in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. To confirm this source location and to determine DP's spatial distribution, 26 tree bark samples were collected in triplicate from the northeastern United States, and the concentrations of DP and several brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were measured. Most concentrations of DP in tree bark were found to be much higher than those of the BFRs. The highest DP concentrations were > 100 ng g(-1) bark in the city of Niagara Falls, dropping rapidly width distance from the potential source. A simple one-dimensional, Gaussian diffusion model was used to explain the spatial distribution of DP and to locate the source. The calculated source location was < 7 km away from the DP manufacturing plant it! Niagara Falls, New York.

Samples were taken by peristaltic pumping at 10 cm depth intervals in the oxycline zone from June 1987 to September 1988. A model of rotifer vertical structure in stratified lakes is proposed. Rotifers concentrate their populations at the depths with intense gradients. As stratification develops some rotifer populations show a downward migration following the thermocline and some others show an upward migration following the oxycline. The production-respiration balance in the lake, and so the position of the oxycline with respect to the thermocline and the layer of maximum production, depends on meteorological conditions. A shift in the dominance of congeneric or related species can occur in consecutive years. In Lake La Cruz, mixing conditions and subterranean inflow in spring were much more intense in 1988 than 1987, and the distance between production and decomposition depths was smaller in 1988. Anuraeopsis miraclei, an oxycline-bound species with high abundance in 1987, was displaced by A. fissa in 1988. A. fissa, which was a metalimnetic species during early summer, reached peak densities (3 x 10(4) ind l-1) at the oxycline, equaling the abundance of A. miraclei the preceeding year.					; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Armengol, Javier/H-2325-2015	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; 													0018-8158					APR 16	1993	255						381	388		10.1007/BF00025863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025863													WOS:A1993LD64400055

Assessing the metabolism of sedimentary microbial communities using the hydrogen isotopic composition of fatty acids	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The hydrogen isotopic composition of fatty acids (FAs) has previously been shown to reflect the metabolism of microorganisms in pure culture, but has rarely been tested in the environment. Here, we report the abundance and hydrogen isotopic composition of polar lipid derived FAs extracted from surface sediments of the saline Lake Grevelingen (The Netherlands), at two different stations and during two seasons with oxic bottom water conditions during spring and hypoxic to anoxic conditions during late summer. These data are compared with the bacterial diversity revealed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. All measured FAs were depleted in deuterium relative to the bottom water by 103 parts per thousand to 267 parts per thousand. FAs associated with heterotrophic bacteria (i-15:0 and ai-15:0) showed the smallest fractionation (-103 parts per thousand to -185 parts per thousand) while those derived from pelagic photoautotrophic phytoplankton (20: 5) showed the largest fractionation (-230 parts per thousand to -267 parts per thousand). Overall, the hydrogen isotope fractionation reflected in the majority of the more commonly occurring FAs (14:0, 16:0, 16:1 omega 7) is relatively large (-172 parts per thousand to -217 parts per thousand). Together with the high relative abundance of the 20: 5 FA, this suggests a substantial contribution from dead pelagic biomass settling from the water column to the sedimentary polar lipid derived FA pool and not from the in situ microbial communities. Therefore, the majority of the isotope signal in the fatty acids from surface sediments might not represent the general metabolism of the active sedimentary communities. Therefore, the input of pelagic biomass into sedimentary environments may bias the information contained in the hydrogen isotopic composition of FAs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Study focus: Precipitation is often the paramount driver in hydrological systems and dynamics. Gridded precipitation data from the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) and the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) are playing a key role in hydrological modelling and hydro-climatological analysis activities. This study explores the discrepancies between ERA5 total precipitation (TP) and MERRA-2 bias-corrected total precipitation (PRECTOTCORR) products and their impacts on streamflow simulation over the GLB. New hydrological insights for the region: ERA5 TP and MERRA-2 PRECTOTCORR perform differently, with substantial discrepancies in the eastern and mid-southern regions of the GLB. MERRA2 PRECTOTCORR severely underestimates precipitation along the eastern shores of the Great Lakes within the eastern GLB, where lake-effect snowfall is common. Accordingly, the MERRA-2 PRECTOTCORR-driven hydrological modelling typically significantly underpredicts streamflow in those areas. In contrast, MERRA-2 PRECTOTCORR performs very well for precipitation estimation and stream discharge simulations in the mid-southern portion of the basin (i.e., the southern portion of the U.S. State of Michigan). However, the northernmost region of the GLB exhibits streamflow overprediction from the PRECTOTCORR-driven hydrological modelling. On average, ERA5 TP overestimates precipitation, especially in winter and spring. Accordingly, ERA5 TP typically results in higher simulated streamflow when compared to PRECTOTCORR. The quantified hydrological performance for the two state-of-the art precipitation products provides critical guidance for hydrological modelling applications in the GLB or other similar regions.

The influence of road salt on seasonal mixing, redox stratification and methane concentrations in urban kettle lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Influxes of saline water from roads treated with deicers can alter the density structure of urban lakes. This can diminish or halt turnover events, such that lakes may transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In nutrient-rich lakes, this lack of turnover can produce persistent hypolimnetic anoxia. We hypothesized that diminished turnover in urban lakes impacted by road salt inputs would lead to increased accumulation of methane in the hypolimnia, with the potential for greater release of methane to the atmosphere via ebullition and from larger storage fluxes of methane when turnover events do occur. The lake water columns of two urban lakes (Woods Lake and Asylum Lake), previously suggested to have transitioned to meromixis and monomixis because of road salt deicer inputs, were sampled monthly from March 2016 to June 2017. A nearby rural lake (North Lake) less likely to be impacted by road salt and maintaining seasonal mixing, was also sampled for comparison. Lake column water was analyzed for conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, manganese, sulfide, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and methane concentrations as a function of depth. All three lakes are eutrophic with at least seasonally anoxic hypolimnia. Our data are consistent with prior studies suggesting that Woods Lake has transitioned to meromixis and Asylum Lake to monomixis due to an influx of dense saline water from roads treated with deicers. In contrast, rural North Lake, which had much lower chloride, sodium and conductivity levels, was dimictic. The diminished or absent turnover in the two urban lakes during fall and spring resulted in persistently anoxic, redox-stratified hypolimnia, with much larger accumulations of methane compared to the rural lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers impact lake mixing and biogeochemistry, especially methane concentrations, with the potential for significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions from urban lakes.

However, the impacts of urban expansion on climate and heat stress for such a city with complex physiographic background (land-water mosaics) remain understudied. Using a coupled urban-lake-atmospheric model, we first examined summer climate responses to urban expansion and lake shrinkage in Wuhan during 2000-2020. Second, multiple heat stress indicators were used to evaluate human thermal comfort in different contexts of interest. Results showed that the presence of water bodies reduced daytime maximum temperature, raised nighttime minimum temperature, and increased moisture content in urban and built-up areas. Urban expansion alone led to summer warming of 0.9 degrees C and drying of 0.9 g/kg, with local peak warming and drying up to 2 degrees C and 1.4 g/kg. In comparison, urban expansion with lake shrinkage showed a reduced magnitude of warming of 0.8 degrees C and increased magnitude of drying of 1.6 g/kg, with the maximum changes up to 1.4 degrees C and 2.0 g/kg. The presence of water bodies reduced while urban expansion increased the frequency of occurrence of yellow and orange heat alert days; however, both increased the number of days exerting high thermal risks on outdoor workers and those days that were dangerous for outdoor pedestrians. Our study underlined that both urban expansion and water body existence exerted a strong influence on summer climate and heat stress in Wuhan, and highlighted that mitigation measures should be taken to alleviate the deleterious impacts of high temperature and humidity on human health.					; wang, boqiang/AAT-2097-2020	Cao, Qian/0000-0002-0580-7407; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 16	2022	127	11							e2021JD036131	10.1029/2021JD036131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JD036131													WOS:000806576000001

Rocky Brook, located 132.6 km above the head of tide, had lower temperatures and higher average flow velocities than the Sabbies River, located 42.5 km above tide. Growth rate and proximate composition were similar between populations, but body morphology and time of downstream migration differed significantly between populations. Individuals from Rocky Brook had more fusiform bodies and larger paired fins than their counterparts in Sabbies River. Rocky Brook fish also left the tributary in the fall rather than in the spring as was the case in Sabbies River. The generality of the flow regime-body morphology relationship observed was tested and confirmed by predicting differences in morphology of juvenile salmon in other rivers based on a knowledge of their flow regimes. Early migration by the Rocky Brook fish probably is related to the higher energetic costs of overwintering in that stream. The phenotypic similarity in growth rate and proximate composition and geographic variation in body morphology and timing of migration have an adaptive basis.

J	HelyHutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH				HelyHutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH			Seasonal and inter-annual variability in the physical properties of Hartbeespoort dam	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A six-year study of weekly and monthly data on the Hartbeespoort catchment and dam covers periods of full supply and drought. The mean lake temperature profle is classical for the latitude and is probably controlled mainly by wind over the main basin in summer, a period when winds over the basin and dam wall gorge are comparable. At this season, several important interactions between physics and biology occur; such as those between the radiation profile and algal growth. The winter temperature profile is probably controlled by the stronger winds over the gorge in spire of the smaller area they cover While the water retention time is around one year the majority of inflowing water appears to flow directly along the bottom to the outlets, yielding a shorter retention rime in the bottom zone and a longer one near the surface, the two zones being connected largely by effective diffusion. Stability is lower than suggested by other experience in the hemisphere, a reduction associated possibly with the shallow depth of the dam and mixing along the rocky flanks. The unexpected constancy of the temperature profile cycles as the drought deepened would be influenced by the decrease in influx and wind over the main basin, and the effect of an increase in the surface energy balance on the temperatures of the surface water and influent streams. Reductions in total heat, stability and wind-work are consistent with reduced lake volume, surface area, and depth. Reduction in the euphotic zone is consistent with surface scum developing under lighter winds. Many of these physical conclusions, which were deduced from measurements alone, were confirmed by model studies.																			0038-2353					JUN	1997	93	6					283	289																WOS:A1997YC29400011

Debate on the quantitative contribution from precipitation and other factors including glacier melting continues, but with more evidence showing that precipitation dominates the interdecadal increase in inner TP lake water storage. However, the TP lake level changes (LLCs) and the potential connection with regional precipitation at interannual timescale and the underlying atmospheric processes, especially for the extreme years, remain unclear yet. The year 2015 and 2018 witness the largest lake level decrease and increase for some major TP lakes during past decades, accompanying extreme rainfall deficit and surplus in mid-summer (July-August) in these two years, respectively. Understanding such extreme hydroclimate events over TP is of great importance for the water resource security in Asia. The central to eastern TP (CETP) is divided into 8 subregions according to the geographical locations of data available lakes and meteorological stations. The mid-summer LLCs on central TP (CTP, subregion II) are robustly and highly related with the concurrent rainfall there, while LLCs on northern central TP (subregion III) are significantly linked to the rainfall over northeastern TP (NETP, subregion VI). The extreme TP lake level decrease and corresponding rainfall deficit in 2015 is closely related to the strong anomalous water vapor divergence, which is mainly induced by weakened westerly winds. Meanwhile, strong wave propagates from the Ural Mountains and North Atlantic to TP and East Asia. In contrast, the extremely high lake level increase and rainfall surplus in 2018 is predominated by easterly winds which are related to the strengthened East Asian summer monsoon. Simultaneously, the western Pacific subtropical high becomes much stronger and extremely northwestward. The CTP rainfall deficit year composite mostly reflects the 2015 case, and NETP rainfall surplus year composite largely resembles the 2018 case, showing similar but weaker atmospheric circulation signals.

This chapter has two main aims: (i) to analyse the characteristics of floods in Romania, based on their origin, frequency and magnitude; (ii) to present case studies on the relation between river channel dynamics and floods. In most cases, in Romania, floods occur in spring and summer (up to 3/4 of the total number of floods) and have mostly pluvial origins. Rivers from the External Curvature (Carpathians, Subcarpathians and Romanian Plain) suffered historical floods in 2005, reflected by a slight extension of the river channel (for example, Putna and Buzau watercourses). Rivers from Banat Plain also recorded floods in 2005; a high volume of water created breaches in dikes and the long stagnation of water determined morphological modifications of the floodplain. The Danube River registered historical floods in 2006; due to the morphometry of the floodplain, the river overflowed the banks and the dikes, covering the floodplain between Rast and Bistret towards the homonym lake. The flash-flood from Ilisua River basin in June 2006 generated some modifications in the river channel morphology due to fine materials accumulation, with a thickness of 0.2-1.5 m, and coarser ones, which created bars with heights of 0.5-1 m; materials came from landslides and bank collapse. The interactions between hydrological phenomena and morphological processes may have consequences with ephemeral character, reversible on shortterm, but also on long-term, with a potential impact on the environment and on the society. This analysis underlines the applied character of hydrogeomorphology.					; Ioana-Toroimac, Gabriela/AEK-0203-2022; Armaş, Iuliana/AAL-5051-2020; Zaharia, Liliana/AAB-2505-2019	Zaharia, Liliana/0000-0003-3069-0113; 													2194-315X		978-3-319-32589-7; 978-3-319-32587-3				2017							821	844		10.1007/978-3-319-32589-7_33	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32589-7_33	10.1007/978-3-319-32589-7												WOS:000398934400034

The model also quantified the resorption mechanism. Wet precipitation, throughfall, foliage, and litter fall data for 1997 were used to quantify the following: (1) dry deposition intercepted by forest cover (0.38, 0.07, 0.07, and 0.03 kg.ha(-1) for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively); (2) leaching from foliage (1.81, 6.46, 0.48, and 0.13 kg.ha(-1) for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively); and (3) foliar resorption (N = 65%, P = 65%, K = 42%, Mg = 30%, and Ca = 10%). Foliar N, P, and K pools increased after bud break and remained constant until mid-September when they decreased rapidly. The foliar Ca pool increased until leaf fall, while the foliar Mg pool reached a maximum in early July and decreased slowly until leaf senescence. Phosphorus, K, Ca, and Mg were leached from the canopy whereas N from wet precipitation was retained by the canopy. The relatively high Mg and Ca resorption rates are consistent with the low soil Ca and Mg availability reported at the LCW. Consideration of leaching and dry deposition, as well as the temporal dimension, demonstrated the importance of each of these parameters for increasing the accuracy of the foliar nutrient resorption estimates.					; Ouimet, Rock/IQS-0362-2023; Duchesne, Louis/KEH-9796-2024	Ouimet, Rock/0000-0003-1282-2493; Duchesne, Louis/0000-0001-6784-445X; 													0045-5067					FEB	2001	31	2					333	344		10.1139/cjfr-31-2-333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-31-2-333													WOS:000166986700015

Strong thermal and chemical stratification developed in the water column early in spring and led rapidly to anoxia in the hypolimnion, which extended to less than 1.0 m from the surface. In the epilimnion only small bacteria were abundant. In the anoxic zone both the abundance and the mean size of bacteria were considerably higher than in the epilimnion. These differences are thought to be the result of different grazing pressure from zooplankton in the two zones. In late summer a high concentration of bacteriochlorophyll d in the upper hypolimnion indicated a high density of photosynthetic bacteria. Bacterial biomass was similar to that of phytoplankton in the epilimnion, but 23 times higher in the whole water column. In August, dark fixation of inorganic radiocarbon in the anaerobic zone was 51% of the total C-14-incorporation and the contribution of light fixation was only 5.4%. In the polyhumic Mekkojarvi, bacterioplankton was evidently a potentially significant carbon source for higher trophic levels, but bacterioplankton production could not be supported by phytoplankton alone. Allochthonous inputs of dissolved organic matter probably support most of the bacterial production.																			0018-8158					FEB 21	1992	229						159	168		10.1007/BF00006998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006998													WOS:A1992HL35400013

In view of differing physical characteristics and the impacts of historical contamination by PCBs within these lakes, spatial variation of PCB concentrations and air water exchange across these lakes may be expected. Both lakes displayed statistically similar aqueous and atmospheric PCB concentrations. Total aqueous concentrations of 29 PCBs ranged from 1.5 pg L-1 in the open lake of Lake Erie (site E02) in 2011 spring to 105 pg L-1 in Niagara (site On05) in 2012 summer, while total atmospheric concentrations were 7.7-634 pg m(-3) across both lakes. A west-to-east gradient was observed for aqueous PCBs in Lake Erie. River discharge and localized influences (e.g., sediment resuspension and regional alongshore transport) likely dominated spatial trends of aqueous PCBs in both lakes. Air water exchange fluxes of Sigma(7)PCBs ranged from -2.4 (+/- 1.9) ng m(-2) day(-1) (deposition) in Sheffield (site E03) to 9.0 (+/- 3.1) ng day(-1) (volatilization) in Niagara (site On05). Net volatilization of PCBs was the primary trend across most sites and periods. Almost half of variation in air water exchange fluxes was attributed to the difference in aqueous concentrations of PCBs. Uncertainty analysis in fugacity ratios and mass fluxes in air water exchange of PCBs indicated that PCBs have reached or approached equilibrium only at the eastern Lake Erie and along the Canadian shore of Lake Ontario sites, where air-water exchange fluxes dominated atmospheric concentrations.

Sex-Specific Movement Response of an Estuarine Sciaenid (Cynoscion nebulosus) to Freshets	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												During a 2.5-year acoustic telemetry study in a Louisiana estuary (Calcasieu Lake), two major freshets occurred (peak river flows > 350 m(3) s(-1)) in separate years and seasons, which provided an opportunity to evaluate the movement response of adult spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) to large pulses of freshwater entering the estuary. A total of 172 spotted seatrout (101 females, 49 males, and 22 fish whose sex was unknown) were implanted with acoustic transmitters (battery life similar to 1 year) and released across four separate tagging events in the spring and fall of both 2007 and 2008; the movements of these fish were monitored by an estuarine-wide array of 60 receivers. Both freshets considerably reduced salinities in the upper bay, from 15-20 to < 5. Interestingly, spotted seatrout exhibited a sex-specific response to these freshet-induced low salinities (< 5). During both freshets, males continued to utilize and remained in the upper bay, but females left the area and moved (> 10 km) to the lower bay where salinities were higher (10-20). This sex-specific movement response to changing salinities has not been explored or demonstrated previously in spotted seatrout. Accordingly, these results provide environmental mangers with unique information on how salinity dynamics affect the accessibility of this economically and ecologically important species to both anglers and scientific surveys. This information also provides insight into how this species may respond to large-scale freshwater diversions that are being planned as part of coastal restoration efforts along the Gulf coast of the USA. More broadly, our results add to a limited but growing body of evidence that environmental preferences of estuarine and coastal fishes often differ between sexes and that the variable abiotic conditions, so characteristic of estuaries, can have important behavioral consequences for mobile organisms living in these systems.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2015	38	5					1492	1504		10.1007/s12237-014-9889-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-014-9889-z													WOS:000358611500008

Contrasting patterns of climatic changes during the Holocene across the Italian Peninsula reconstructed from pollen data	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Lake-level records from Italy suggest that patterns of precipitation in the central Mediterranean during the Holocene were divided between the north and south, but a scarcity of reliable palaeoclimatic records in the north and central-southern Mediterranean means new evidence is needed to validate this hypothesis. We provide robust quantitative estimates of Holocene climate in the Mediterranean region using four high-resolution pollen records from northern (Lakes Ledro and Accesa) and southern (Lakes Trifoglietti and Pergusa) Italy. Multiple methods are used to provide an improved assessment of the palaeoclimatic reconstruction uncertainty. The multi-method approach uses the pollenbased weighted averaging, weighted-average partial leastsquares regression, modern analogue technique, and the nonmetric multidimensional scaling/generalized additive model methods. We use independent lake-level data to validate the precipitation reconstructions. Our results support a climatic partition between northern and southern Italy during the Holocene, confirming the hypothesis of opposing mid-Holocene summer precipitation regimes in the Mediterranean. The northern sites (Ledro, Accesa) are characterized by minima for summer precipitation and lake levels during the early to midHolocene, while the southern sites (Trifoglietti, Pergusa) are marked by maxima for precipitation and lake levels at the same time. Both pollen-inferred precipitation and lake levels indicate the opposite pattern during the late Holocene, a maximum in northern Italy and a minimum in southern Italy/Sicily. Summer temperatures show the same partitioning, with warm conditions in northern Italy and cool conditions in Sicily during the early/mid-Holocene, and a reversal during the late Holocene. Comparison with marine cores from the Aegean Sea suggests that climate trends and gradients observed in Italy show strong similarities with those recognized from the Aegean Sea, and more generally speaking in the eastern Mediterranean.

During the spring and sunu-ner floodin- season it inundates a large area while in the winter it shrinks considerably creating a large tract of marshland for wild migratory birds. A better knowledge on the water coverage duration and the beginning and ending dates for the vast range of marshlands surrounding the lake is important for the measurement, modeling and management of marshland ecosystems. In addition, the abundance of a special type of snail (Oncomelania hupensis) (the intermediate host of parasite schistosome (Schistosomajaponicum) in this region) is also heavily dependent on the water covera!2e information. However, there is no accurate DEM for the lake bottom and the inundated marshland, nor is there sufficient water level information over this area. In this study, we assess the feasibility on the use of multitemporal Landsat images in mapping the spatial-temporal change of Poyang Lake water body and the temporal process of water inundatin2 of marshlands. All eight Landsat Thematic Mapper images that are cloud free during a period of one year were used in this study. We used NDWI and MNDWI methods to map water bodies. We then examine the annual spatial-temporal change of the Poyang Lake water body. Finally we attempt to obtain the duration of water inundation of marshlands based on the temporal sequence of water extent determined from the Landsat images. The results showed although the images can be used to capture the snapshots of water coverage in this area, they are insufficient to provide accurate estimation on the spatial-temporal process of water inundating over the marshlands through linear interpolation.					; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021; Xu, Bing/C-7732-2015; Huang, huabing/JHT-7278-2023	huang, hua bing/0000-0001-6253-8437; Xu, Bing/0000-0001-9159-2512; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-6912-0				2007	6752		1-2						675218	10.1117/12.760674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.760674													WOS:000251046800043

An Alcian blue staining/colorimetric method was used to assess samples in both the presence and absence of metabolic inhibitors of bacteria. TEP formation was always negligible in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. However, the TEP accumulation rate (t = 0 to 1) associated with bacterial growth was high (156.9 +/- 66 mu g Gum Xanthan equivalents l(-1) d(-1)) in September, October, and March, and low (0 +/- 12.7 mu g Gum Xanthan equiv. l(-1) d(-1)) from December to February, even for samples with large increases in bacterial numbers. The observed TEP accumulation rate without metabolic inhibitors was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.799, n = 9), bacterial organic carbon production rate (r = 0.784, n = 9), and bacterial number (r = 0.948, n = 9) in the field, indicating the importance of exudates from phytoplankton and probably from bacteria. During the months with high TEP formation rates, the bacterial TEP that formed in terms of carbon exceeded bacterial carbon utilization by 1- to 2-fold, suggesting an indirect process of bacterial TEP formation. Based on microscopic examinations of seawater cultures and field samples, the scavenging of TEP precursors by increased bacterial particles was important in the bacterial enhancement of high TEP formation in fall and early spring. These observations suggest the importance of bacteria as mediators of bacteria-associated TEP formation coupled to the supply of usable dissolved organic matter, including TEP precursors.

Calcium and magnesium-limited dolomite precipitation at Deep Springs Lake, California	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Dolomite [Ca,Mg(CO3)(2)] precipitation from supersaturated ionic solutions at Earth surface temperatures is considered kinetically inhibited because of the difficulties experienced in experimentally reproducing such a process. Nevertheless, recent dolomite is observed to form in hypersaline and alkaline environments. Such recent dolomite precipitation is commonly attributed to microbial mediation because dolomite has been demonstrated to form in vitro in microbial cultures. The mechanism of microbially mediated dolomite precipitation is, however, poorly understood and it remains unclear what role microbial mediation plays in natural environments. In the study presented here, simple geochemical methods were used to assess the limitations and controls of dolomite formation in Deep Springs Lake, a highly alkaline playa lake in eastern California showing ongoing dolomite authigenesis. The sediments of Deep Springs Lake consist of unlithified, clay-fraction dolomite ooze. Based on delta O-18 equilibria and textural observations, dolomite precipitates from oxygenated and agitated surface brine. The Na-SO4-dominated brine contains up to 500 mm dissolved inorganic carbon whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations are ca 1 and 0 3 mm, respectively. Precipitation in the subsurface probably is not significant because of the lack of Ca2+ (below 0 01 mm). Under such highly alkaline conditions, the effect of microbial metabolism on supersaturation by pH and alkalinity increase is negligible. A putative microbial effect could, however, support dolomite nucleation or support crystal growth by overcoming a kinetic barrier. An essential limitation on crystal growth rates imposed by the low Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations could favour the thermodynamically more stable carbonate phase (which is dolomite) to precipitate. This mode of unlithified dolomite ooze formation showing delta O-13 values near to equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 (ca 3 parts per thousand) contrasts the formation of isotopically light (organically derived), hard-lithified dolomite layers in the subsurface of some less alkaline environments. Inferred physicochemical controls on dolomite formation under highly alkaline conditions observed in Deep Springs Lake may shed light on conditions that favoured extensive dolomite formation in alkaline Precambrian oceans, as opposed to modern oceans where dolomites only form diagenetically in organic C-rich sediments.					; Reyes, Carolina/KMX-1652-2024; Collins, Lisa/C-9562-2014	Reyes, Carolina/0000-0002-7413-607X; Meister, Patrick/0000-0003-3623-6456; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				DEC	2011	58	7					1810	1830		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2011.01240.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2011.01240.x													WOS:000297972600008

Within 2 years, 2008 and 2009, we studied the thermal and optical regimes of two adjacent stratified lakes in northern Italy, the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Monate (2.5 km(2), max. depth 34 m) and the eutrophic Lake Varese (14.8 km(2), 26 m). After the cold winter 2008-2009, a heat wave starting in May turned the whole year 2009 the second hottest after 2003. The particular sequence of meteorological events resulted in extreme vertical temperature gradients and unusually high thermal stability of both lakes. All calculated thermal parameters showed the highest values in 2009 while also the values for 2008 exceeded considerably those published for these lakes in the past. Due to the large wind exposed surface, wind mixing was supposedly the dominating mechanism of heat transfer in the shallower eutrophic Lake Varese where, due to low water transparency, large amount of solar energy trapped in the upper layers markedly increased the thermal stability. In the deeper and more transparent Lake Monate, the deeper penetrating solar irradiance contributed to better energy dissipation within the water column and smaller interannual differences in thermal stability.

Understanding the mid-Holocene climate	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Paleoclimatic evidence suggests that during the mid-Holocene epoch (about 6000 yr ago) North America and North Africa were significantly drier and wetter, respectively, than at present. Modeling efforts to attribute these differences to changes in orbital parameters and greenhouse gas (GHG) levels have had limited success, especially over North America. In this study, the importance of a possibly cooler tropical Pacific Ocean during the epoch (akin to a permanent La Nina-like perturbation to the present climate) incausing these differences is emphasized. Systematic sets of atmospheric general circulation model experiments, with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific basin and an interactive mixed layer ocean elsewhere, are performed. Given the inadequacies of current fully coupled climate models in simulating the tropical Pacific climate, this intermediate coupling model configuration is argued to be more suitable for quantifying the contributions of the altered orbital forcing, GHG levels, and tropical Pacific SST conditions to the different mid-Holocene climates. The simulated responses in this configuration are in fact generally more consistent with the available evidence from paleovegetation and sedimentary records. Coupling to the mixed layer ocean enhances the wind-evaporation-SST feedback over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The net response to the orbital changes is to shift the North Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) northward, and make North Africa wetter. The response to the reduced GHG levels opposes, but does not eliminate, these changes. The northward-shifted ITCZ also blocks the moisture supply from the Gulf of Mexico into North America. This drying tendency is greatly amplified by the local response to La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. Consistent with the paleoclimatic evidence, the simulated North American drying is also most pronounced in the growing (spring) season.

J	BRUNEAU, M; MAGNIN, E				BRUNEAU, M; MAGNIN, E			LARVAL LIFE OF BULLFROGS RANA-CATESBEIANA SHAW (AMPHIBIA ANURA) FROM LAURENTIDES, QUEBEC	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The 8908 tadpoles of R. catesbeiana used in this study come from 3 lakes of the Laurentian region, north of Montreal (45.degree.52'' N, 74.degree. W). Histograms of body length and various morphometric data taken on the subjects revealed a few aspects of their biology. The majority of tadpoles undergo metamorphosis after 2 winters, and the remainder, in variable number according to the years, after 3 winters. Body length is approximately 4 mm 10-15 days after spawning; it varies between 19 and 26 mm after the 1st winter, between 40 and 52 mm after the 2nd winter, and between 53 and 56 mm after the 3rd. The largest tadpole had a body length of 68 mm and a total length of 162 mm. Growth occurs mostly in June, July and Aug. and it varies with temperature. Metamorphosis never occurs before a tadpole reaches a body length of 43 mm, a total length of 100 mm, and has posterior legs of 50 mm in length. This usually happens in July or at the beginning of Aug. The tadpoles that are about to undergo metamorphosis seem to look for the warmest spots of the lake.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1980	58	2					169	174		10.1139/z80-018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z80-018													WOS:A1980JP20500003

Detection and mapping of water and chlorophyll-a spread using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for water quality assessment of inland water bodies	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality monitoring of reservoirs is currently a significant challenge in the tropical regions of the world due to limited monitoring stations and hydrological data. Remote sensing techniques have proven to be a powerful tool for continuous real-time monitoring and assessment of tropical reservoirs water quality. Although many studies have detected chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations as a proxy to represent nutrient contamination, using Sentinel 2 for eutrophic or hypereutrophic inland water bodies, mainly reservoirs, minimal efforts have been made for oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs. The present study aimed to develop a modeling framework to map and estimate spatio-temporal variability of Chl-a levels and associated water spread using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI). Moreover, the impact of land use/land cover type of the contributing watershed in the oligo-mesotrophic reservoir, Bhadra (tropical reservoir), for 2018 and 2019 using Sentinel 2 satellite data was analyzed. The results show that the water spread area was higher in the post-monsoon months and lower in the summer months. This was further validated by the correlation with reservoir storage, which showed a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.97, 2018; R-2 = 0.93, 2019). The estimated Chl-a spread was higher in the winter season, because the reservoir catchment was dominated by deciduous forest, producing a large amount of leaf litter in tropical regions, which leads to an increase in the level of Chl-a. It was found that Chl-a spread in the reservoir, specifically at the inlet sources and near agricultural land practices (western parts of the Bhadra reservoir). Based on the findings of this study, the MCI spectral index derived from Sentinel 2 data can be used to accurately map the spread of Chl-a in diverse water bodies, thereby offering a robust scientific basis for effective reservoir management.

J	Lin, J; Li, C; Boswell, KM; Kimball, M; Rozas, L				Lin, Jun; Li, Chunyan; Boswell, Kevin M.; Kimball, Matthew; Rozas, Lawrence			Examination of Winter Circulation in a Northern Gulf of Mexico Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Numerical model experiments were conducted to examine how estuarine circulation and salinity distribution in the Calcasieu Lake Estuary (CLE) of southwest Louisiana respond to the passage of cold fronts. River runoff, local wind stress, and tides from December 20, 2011, to February 1, 2012, were included as input. The experiments showed an anticyclonic circulation in the eastern CLE, a cyclonic circulation in West Cove, and a saltwater conduit in the navigation channel between these circulation cells. Freshwater from the river and wetlands tends to flow over the shallow shoals toward the ocean, presenting a case of the conventional estuarine circulation with shallow water influenced by river discharge and with weak tidally-induced motion, enhanced by wind. The baroclinic pressure gradient is important for the circulation and saltwater intrusion. The effect of remote wind-driven oscillation plays an important role in circulation and salinity distribution in winter. Unless it is from the east, wind is found to inhibit saltwater intrusion through the narrow navigation channel, indicating the effect of Ekman setup during easterly wind. A series of north-south oriented barrier islands in the lake uniquely influenced water level and salinity distribution between the shallow lake and deep navigation channel. The depth of the navigation channel is also crucial in influencing saltwater intrusion: the deeper the channel, the more saltwater intrusion and the more intense estuarine circulation. Recurring winter storms have a significant accumulated effect on the transport of water and sediment, saltwater intrusion, and associated environmental and ecosystem effects.

J	Keeler, GJ; Gratz, LE; Al-Wali, K				Keeler, GJ; Gratz, LE; Al-Wali, K			Long-term atmospheric mercury wet deposition at Underhill, Vermont	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Section 112(m) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, referred to as the Great Waters Program, mandated an assessment of atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) to Lake Champlain. Mercury (Hg) was listed as a priority HAP and has continued to be a high priority for a number of national and international programs. An assessment of the magnitude and seasonal variation of atmospheric Hg levels and deposition in the Lake Champlain basin was initiated in December 1992 which included event precipitation collection, as well as collection of vapor and particle phase Hg in ambient air. Sampling was performed at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT. The range in the annual volume-weighted mean concentration for Hg in precipitation was 7.8-10.5 ng/l for the 11-year sampling period and the average amount of Hg deposited with each precipitation event was 0.10 mu g/m(2). The average amount of Hg deposited through precipitation each year from 1993 to 2003 was 9.7 mu g/m(2)/yr. A seasonal pattern for Hg in precipitation is clearly evident, with increased Hg concentrations and deposition observed during spring and summer months. While a clear trend in the 11-year event deposition record at Underhill was not observed, a significant decrease in the event max-to-monthly ratio was observed suggesting that a major source influence was controlled over time. Discrete precipitation events were responsible for significant fractions of the monthly and annual loading of Hg to the forested ecosystem in Vermont. Monthly-averaged temperatures were found to be moderately correlated with monthly volume-weighted mean Hg concentrations (r(2)=0.61) and Hg deposition (r(2)=0.67) recorded at the Vermont site. Meteorological analysis indicated the highest levels of Hg in precipitation were associated with regional transport from the west, southwest, and south during the warmer months.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				MAR	2005	14	1-2					71	83		10.1007/s10646-004-6260-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-004-6260-3								15931959					WOS:000227700000006

An analysis of long-term phytoplankton dynamics in Muskegon Lake, a Great Lakes Area of Concern	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Long-term monitoring of aquatic ecosystems is essential to distinguish the effects of human-induced stressors from natural patterns of ecologic variation, especially in Great Lakes Area of Concern such as Muskegon Lake. Samples collected between 2003-2009, as part of a continuing long-term monitoring study of the lake, were analyzed to: 1) detect spatial and temporal patterns in the phytoplankton biovolume and species composition; 2) evaluate the environmental variables that regulate phytoplankton community composition changes; and 3) determine the ecological conditions under which toxin-producing Microcystis species occur. Distinct patterns in Muskegon Lake phytoplankton were not evident among sites, which can be explained, at least in part, by the well-mixed waters in this drowned river mouth system. However, surface and bottom samples within sites had significantly different biovolume and species composition, suggesting that horizontal mixing did not extend throughout the water column. Surface samples had greater phytoplankton biovolume than bottom samples, possibly because of greater irradiance. Seasonally, the least biovolume was recorded in spring samples, which were dominated by diatoms. Phytoplankton biovolume was greatest in the summer when cyanobacteria were abundant. Environmental variables that correlated highly with the ordination space defined by species composition included sulfate, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, and chloride. Results from regression tree analysis predicted increasing biovolume of Microcystis aeruginosa with increasing concentrations of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen. The seven-year period of this study did not reveal major changes in the lake's environment and phytoplankton communities, but the presence of invasive and toxin-producing species warrants their continued monitoring.

The Indus Civilization in South Asia has been the focus of investigations to archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists. But little attention was paid earlier to the role of climate variability in shaping the course of this well-established urban civilization. In this paper, we have presented a review of literature to understand various factors that affected the evolution of this cultural enigma. We suggest that the climate change in the region was a major controlling factor in determining the fate of Indus civilization settlements. The transformation of hunter-gatherers into pastoral community between 7000 and 3200 B.C.E., the establishment of village habitations along the Indus River and its tributaries in the Early Harappan phase, urbanization and shifting towards Ghaggar-Hakra rivers in the Mature Harappan phase, and final displacement towards Ganga-Yamuna doab (interfluve) region as village culture were largely modulated by the changing strength of the Indian summer monsoon and amount of precipitation in the region.					; Dutt, Som/ABA-9093-2020	Saravanan, P/0000-0003-1876-9902; Gupta, Anil/0000-0003-0536-3911; Dutt, Som/0000-0002-2894-5861													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 25	2019	507				SI		15	23		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.11.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.11.012													WOS:000464516500003

Forty percent of canvasbacks wintering at Lake Catahoula had elevated concentrations of lead (>6.7 mug g-1 dry weight) in the liver; 33% had concentrations consistent with lead intoxication (>26.7 mug g-1). Based on the number of canvasbacks that winter at Lake Catahoula and the frequency of lead exposure there, more than 5% of the continental population of canvasbacks may be exposed to lead at Lake Catahoula alone. Lead concentrations in livers differed among months and were higher in males than females, but were not different in adults and immatures. Concentrations of selenium and mercury in livers of females differed among months but not by age or location. Cadmium concentrations in livers differed by age, location and month of collection, but not by sex. Frequencies and concentrations of trace elements not commonly associated with adverse effects on avian species (aluminum, arsenic, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, silver, vanadium and zinc) are presented. Except for the elevated concentrations of lead at Catahoula Lake, all trace elements were at background concentrations.

J	HERLIHY, AT; MILLS, AL				HERLIHY, AT; MILLS, AL			FACTORS CONTROLLING THE REMOVAL OF SULFATE AND ACIDITY FROM THE WATERS OF AN ACIDIFIED LAKE	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Although Lake anna, an impoundment in Central Virginia, receives acid mine drainage (AMD) from Contrary Creek, the effects of the AMD pollution on the lake are less severe than expected. Previous work at Lake Anna has shown that bacterial sulfate reduction in the lake sediments plays an important role in the recovery of the lake from the AMD inputs. Sulfate removal rates were measured in sediment microcosms under a variety of experimental conditions to determined the factors controlling the rate of sulfate and acidity removal from the lake water. Sulfate removal rates were not significantly different over the short term (3 weeks) in summer sediment microcosms incubated at 6 vs 26.degree.C. Winter sediment microcosms showed no significant sulfate removal during the 18 day experiment when incubated at either 6 or 28.degree.C. Thus there is a strong seasonal temperature effect in Lake Anna sediments but no significant short term effect. Simulated AMD, with and without Fe, was added to sediment microcosms collected from an unpolluted part of the lake. The microcosms with Fe had significantly higher rates of sulfate removal indicating that Fe play an important role in transporting sulfate to the sediment and/or in preventing oxidation of the reduced sulfide. After 27 days, from 54 to 96% of the added sulfate in the simulated AMD was recovered as FeS or S0 in the top 4 cm of sediment. In a separate experiment, 35S-SO42- was found to attach to precipitating Fe oxyhydroxides (1.5 to 4.7 mol SO42- mol-1 Fe precipitate) upon mixing Contrary Creek (AMD) and Lake Anna waters. Results of this study suggest that sulfate removal may be more rapid in metal rich AMD systems than in metal poor systems characteristic of those which receive acidic deposition.

The role of catchment characteristics in determining surface water nitrogen in four upland regions in the UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Hydrochemical and catchment data from 80 upland moorland sites in four regions with contrasting climate, soils, geology and geomorphology have been analysed to assess the key catchment attributes that influence enhanced leaching of soluble nitrogen to surface waters. The regions are the South Pennines of northern England, the Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, the Galloway region of south-west Scotland and the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, all highly acidified, with median pH values of <5-5. Linear regression of mean summer and winter concentrations for nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were expressed as functions of catchment attributes. Nitrate concentrations in waters draining catchments dominated by peaty soils (large C pool) were much less than those in catchments dominated by mineral soils (small C pool). Hence, if future N deposition levels are maintained or increase, high-altitude catchments with small carbon pools are potentially more susceptible to NO3- leaching. All N species exhibit seasonality, this is most marked in Galloway and least marked in the South Pennines, which implies that the South Pennines have reached an advanced stage of N saturation. Surface water inorganic N concentrations and the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved organic N (DON) can be related to deposition inputs, although relationships differ throughout the year. If the DOC/DON ratio is indicative of catchment N saturation, levels of N retention are at least partially determined by deposition levels. This study identifies N deposition as a major inter-regional control on the degree of catchment N saturation and on N leaching to surface waters; it stresses the importance of catchment factors in modifying the relationship between N deposition and leaching in acid sensitive UK upland catchments.

J	Lin, C; Xiong, JF; Ma, RH; Zhu, CX				Lin, Chen; Xiong, Junfeng; Ma, Ronghua; Zhu, Chenxi			Identifying the critical watershed regions creating lake nutrient enrichment (SLRs) based on a watershed-lake integrated perspective - A case study of Chaohu Lake Basin, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Identifying critical watershed source regions is essential for lake environments protection. However, related studies are mainly focused on assessing watershed Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) loads, while the impact of watershed on lake nutrients is rarely considered. To fill this gap, the amounts of watershed nutrient loss over the last ten years were assessed, and the corresponding lake TN and TP concentrations were acquired. Finally, the critical watershed regions creating lake nutrient enrichment (SLRs) were identified by analyzing the relationships from the integrated watershed-lake perspective. The results indicated that: i) The watershed TN and TP output amounts showed a rising trend in the last 10 years (mostly between 2012 and 2016); ii) The lake TP and TN in the western lake were much higher than those in the eastern lake; and iii) SLRs were located in the western Chaohu watershed. Specific findings were obtained from the statistical analysis in sub-watershed and intra-annual scales. First, the SLRs for TN were concentrated in the Nanfei (NF), which covered only 32 subwatersheds and were mainly located in urban construction areas. In contrast, the SLRs for TP were more widely distributed and located contiguously across the major influent streams belonging to the Hangbu (HB) and NF. Second, the intra-annual variance is obvious. For TP, the spring season can be considered the most ideal period for SLRs identification, while the summer season is ideal for TN. These differences are driven by different loss processes, discharge capacities, and occurrence forms for TN and TP. In general, the integrated perspective of lake-watershed is helpful for identifying SLRs, and the temporal analysis at the seasonal scale and spatial analysis at the sub-watershed scale facilitate a deeper understanding of SLRs.

However, due to rapid economic development and the intensification of human activities, many lakes have become eutrophic, which may threaten their status as water resources. Human activities have played a significant role in lake eutrophication, but whether this role is independent of, or coupled with, natural climate change requires further study. We selected Dali Lake, a large lake affected by human activity within the ancient warfare borders, to clarify the ecological response of a lake to climate change and human activity. We used analyses of sedimentary n-alkanes and AMS C-14 dating to reconstruct the paleolimnological evolution of Dali Lake since 15 cal kyr BP, and specifically to assess the timing and causes of eutrophication. The results show that the short-chain n-alkanes (C17-19-alkanes) in Dali Lake are mainly produced by bacteria and algae within the lake, and that the sedimentary absolute abundance of short-chain n-alkanes (A(17-19)-alkanes) can be used as a proxy for assessing the ecological status of the lake. The ecological status of Dali Lake was the most stable during the early to middle Holocene, when the East Asian summer monsoon was strong, but bacterial and algal outbreaks occurred during three episodes of a weakened summer monsoon-the Older Dryas, Younger Dryas, and the Common Era-when the lake experienced different degrees of eutrophication. During the recession of the East Asian summer monsoon, the weakening of precipitation recharge of the lake led to a reduction in lake area and an increase in nutrient concentrations in the lake water, while aeolian dust input was an additional nutrient source, leading to bacterial and algal outbreaks. During the Common Era, lake eutrophication occurred in the context of both summer monsoon recession and enhanced human activities, but their combined effects did not lead to more intense lake eutrophication than was caused by monsoon recession during the Younger Dryas. We conclude that, although human activities have enhanced the eutrophication of Dali Lake, the reduction in lake size due to monsoon recession and the resulting increase in the salinity and nutrient concentration of the lake water, combined with increased aeolian inputs, were a more important trigger of lake eutrophication.

J	BERG, NH				BERG, NH			MOUNTAIN-TOP RIMING AT SITES IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Icing at locations near Lake Tahoe and in northern California appears to be soft or hard rime. At one site during three recent winters, and at six other locations during the winter of 1986/87, riming was common, occurring on average during 38% of winter days between November and April. On an hourly basis, rime occurred during 19% of the 17,850 h of observation at five locations. Rime and precipitation were often concurrent, with precipitation occurring during, or within 4 h of riming three times as often as riming alone. Rime occurrence was often synchronous at the sampling sites around Lake Tahoe, 40% of the time being concurrent at two or more sites. Riming intensity, as indexed by deicing cycles of Rosemount ice detectors at five sites near Lake Tahoe, was much lower than at sites in the northeastern United States. An algorithm developed through discriminant analysis correctly classified independent observations of riming over 82% of the time. The absence of riming was correctly classified in over 92% of the cases. First approximations of water equivalent contributed by rime ranged from 14 to 66% of recipitation recorded during comparable periods at four sites around Lake Tahoe during the 1986/87 winter.																			0004-0851					NOV	1988	20	4					429	447		10.2307/1551341	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551341													WOS:A1988R184700006

Drainage water recycling reduced nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment losses from a drained agricultural field in eastern North Carolina, USA	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effect of drainage water recycling (DWR) on reducing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sediment losses from agricultural fields to downstream surface water bodies. The two-year study (May 2019-April 2021) was conducted at an agricultural field in eastern North Carolina, U.S. A. A reservoir existed at the site was used to store subsurface drainage and surface runoff water during wet periods and provide supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the crop growing season. On average, the reservoir retained 14% of received inflow, with a higher flow reduction in the dry year (2019-2020; 29%) than the wet year (2020-2021; 8%). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) for the reservoir was 33.8 days for the dry year and 12.4 days for the wet year. The reservoir significantly reduced the loadings of N by 47%, P by 30% and sediment by 87%. Nitrogen load reduction was primarily driven by nitrate assimilation, the dominant form of N in the reservoir. Phosphorus load reduction was attributed to Orthophosphate assimilation as the reservoir released more particulate P than received. Reductions in both water flow and species concentration contributed to nutrient load reductions. Results suggested the removal efficiency of the reservoir would be highest during the summer and early fall months when the reservoir has a smaller water volume (due to irrigation), longer HRT, and warmer temperature. This study clearly demonstrated the potential of DWR for significantly reducing N, P, and sediment losses from agricultural land to receiving surface water. Further research is needed to investigate the physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in the storage reservoir and affect the fate and transport of nutrients and sediment. The understanding of these processes will enable optimizing the treatment efficiency of DWR, which maximizes the system's benefits and reduces construction cost.					; Moursi, Hossam/GSI-5345-2022; Castro-Bolinaga, Celso/HHC-4123-2022; Youssef, Mohamed/AAA-3634-2022	Richardson, Robert/0000-0002-1802-8728; Moursi, Hossam/0000-0002-1157-5120; Castro-Bolinaga, Celso/0000-0002-5990-8609; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 1	2023	279								108179	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108179		JAN 2023											WOS:000960817000001

Press-Pulse Odocoileus Virginianus Herbivory in Relict Tsuga Canadensis Stands in the Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA	FORESTS												Ungulate herbivory occurring within a forest plant community's natural range of variation may help maintain species diversity. However, acute or chronically elevated levels of herbivory can produce dramatic changes in forest communities. For example, chronically high levels of herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) in regions of historically low abundance at northern latitudes have dramatically altered forest community composition. In eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L. Carriere) stands where deer aggregate during winter, high deer use has been associated with a shift towards deciduous species (i.e., maples [Acer spp.]) dominating the regeneration layer. Especially harsh winters can lead to deer population declines, which could facilitate regeneration of species that have been suppressed by browsing, such as hemlock. To enhance our understanding of how fluctuations in herbivory influence regeneration dynamics, we surveyed regeneration and deer use in 15 relict hemlock stands in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 2007 and again in 2015. With the exception of small seedlings (0.04-0.24 m height), primarily maples whose abundance increased significantly (p < 0.05), we observed widespread significant declines (p < 0.05) in the abundance of medium (0.25 <= 1.4 m height) and large regeneration (>1.4 m tall <= 4 cm diameter at breast height) over the study period. Midway through our study period, the region experienced a high severity winter (i.e., polar vortex) which resulted in a substantial decline in the white-tailed deer population. Given the dominance of maples and dearth of hemlock in the seedling layer, the decline in the deer population may fail to forestall or possibly hasten the trend towards maple dominance of the regeneration layer as these stands recover from pulses of acute herbivory associated with high-severity winters and the press of chronically high herbivory that precedes them.																				1999-4907				JUN	2019	10	6							496	10.3390/f10060496	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10060496													WOS:000475305000036
J	Lindgren, P; Grosse, G; Meyer, FJ; Anthony, KW				Lindgren, Prajna; Grosse, Guido; Meyer, Franz J.; Anthony, Katey Walter			An Object-Based Classification Method to Detect Methane Ebullition Bubbles in Early Winter Lake Ice	REMOTE SENSING												Thermokarst lakes in the Arctic and Subarctic release carbon from thawing permafrost in the form of methane and carbon dioxide with important implications for regional and global carbon cycles. Lake ice impedes the release of gas during the winter. For instance, bubbles released from lake sediments become trapped in downward growing lake ice, resulting in vertically-oriented bubble columns in the ice that are visible on the lake surface. We here describe a classification technique using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework to successfully map ebullition bubbles in airborne imagery of early winter ice on an interior Alaska thermokarst lake. Ebullition bubbles appear as white patches in high-resolution optical remote sensing images of snow-free lake ice acquired in early winter and, thus, can be mapped across whole lake areas. We used high-resolution (9-11 cm) aerial images acquired two and four days following freeze-up in the years 2011 and 2012, respectively. The design of multiresolution segmentation and region-specific classification rulesets allowed the identification of bubble features and separation from other confounding factors such as snow, submerged and floating vegetation, shadows, and open water. The OBIA technique had an accuracy of >95% for mapping ebullition bubble patches in early winter lake ice. Overall, we mapped 1195 and 1860 ebullition bubble patches in the 2011 and 2012 images, respectively. The percent surface area of lake ice covered with ebullition bubble patches for 2011 was 2.14% and for 2012 was 2.67%, representing a conservative whole lake estimate of bubble patches compared to ground surveys usually conducted on thicker ice 10 or more days after freeze-up. Our findings suggest that the information derived from high-resolution optical images of lake ice can supplement spatially limited field sampling methods to better estimate methane flux from individual lakes. The method can also be used to improve estimates of methane ebullition from numerous lakes within larger regions.

Transmission Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at Lake Constance (Europe) During the Outbreak of Winter 2005-2006	ECOHEALTH												Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N1 poses a serious threat to domestic animals. Despite the large number of studies on influenza A virus in waterbirds, little is still known about the transmission dynamics, including prevalence, behavior, and spread of these viruses in the wild waterbird population. From January to April 2006, the HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed in 82 dead wild waterbirds at the shores of Lake Constance. In this study, we present simple mathematical models to examine this outbreak and to investigate the transmission dynamics of HPAI in wild waterbirds. The population dynamics model of wintering birds was best represented by a sinusoidal function. This model was considered the most adequate to represent the susceptible compartment of the SIR model. The three transmission models predict a basic reproduction ratio (R (0)) with value of approximately 1.6, indicating a small epidemic, which ended with the migration of susceptible wild waterbirds at the end of the winter. With this study, we quantify for the first time the transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus at Lake Constance during the outbreak of winter 2005-2006. It is a step toward the improvement of the knowledge of transmission of the virus among wild waterbirds.

Wind Speed Effect on the Current Density Distribution in Eutrophic Lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 39TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS					39th IAHR World Congress on From Snow to Sea	JUN 19-24, 2022	Ctr Studies & Experimentat Publ Works, Spain Water, Granada, SPAIN	Univ Granada, Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Coast & Sea, Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Water, China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res	Ctr Studies & Experimentat Publ Works, Spain Water			Water motions in lakes vary broadly and include up-and-downwelling currents, turbulent mixing, and wind generated surface waves. Their combined effect significantly controls how water quality and the lake ecosystem evolve in space and time. Particularly, wind alters the lake surface, which can cause considerable water level fluctuation at specific sections or areas of the lake by maintaining good ecological conditions. Although wind plays a critical role in aquatic ecosystems' function, its influence on the shallow lakes remains scarcely investigated. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of a long-term decrease in wind speed magnitudes on the current density of a shallow eutrophic lake, considering several point source pollutions due to agriculture activities. The annual mean wind speed showed a significant decreasing trend. The maximum continuous days with wind speed < 3 m/s increased significantly from 1981 to 2021. The high-frequency monitoring data showed that bottom water hypoxia occasionally occurred in summer and autumn because of the lake's decreasing water level and high concretion. The numerical results show that lower to medium wind speeds with frequent directional switching toward shore areas developed higher mixing scenarios, which helped reduce water temperatures, distribution, and colony formation of phytoplankton. The onshore winds were the most frequent winds with low wind speeds, whereas; offshore winds have been observed with medium to higher wind speeds. This provides valuable insights in helping policy-makers and water managers to develop appropriate adaptation and protection measures to ensure the good ecological status of the shallow lakes following the European water framework directive.

We used ostracod assemblages from various sites east of Qinghai Lake and from the sediment core QW15 of Daotanghe Pond and combined them with grain size and geochemical data from the same core. The statistical extraction of grain size endmembers (EM) revealed three different transportation processes responsible for pond-related fluvio-lacustrine, pure fluvial and eolian deposits. Identified seasonal effects (eolian mobility phase) and timing of ice cover are possible tracers for the competing influence between the Asian summer monsoon and the Westerlies in the Daotanghe Wetland and surrounding area. Our results show that ostracod associations and sediment properties are evidence of a fluvio-lacustrine fresh water environment without ingression of Qinghai Lake into the wetland. Hydrodynamic variations coupled with phases of eolian input indicate highly variable water budgets in response to climate induced effective moisture supply. The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) until about 1270 CE displays generally moist and warm climate conditions with minor fluctuations, likely in response to variations in summer monsoon intensity. The three-partite period of the Little Ice Age (LIA), shows hydrologically unstable conditions between 1350 and 1530 CE with remarkably colder periods, assigned to a prolonged seasonal ice cover. Pond desiccation and replacement by fluvial deposits occurred between 1530 and 1750 CE, superimposed by eolian deposits. The phase 1730-1900 CE is recorded by the re-occurrence of a pond environment with reduced eolian input. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on ostracod abundances shows similar trends. All three phases of the LIA developed during a weak summer monsoon influence, favoring westerly-derived climate conditions until ca. 1850 CE, in accordance with records from the adjacent regions. Seasonal freezing periods in excess of the average time of frozen water bodies also occurred in periods of the well-known grand solar minima and indicate stronger seasonality, possibly independent from variations in summer monsoon strength but with links to global northern hemispheric climate.

J	Winemiller, KO; Tarim, S; Shormann, D; Cotner, JB				Winemiller, KO; Tarim, S; Shormann, D; Cotner, JB			Fish assemblage structure in relation to environmental variation among Brazos River oxbow lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish assemblages and habitat conditions of oxbow lakes and the main channel of the middle-lower Brazos River, a meandering lowland river in east central Texas, were investigated during summer 1994. All oxbows were eutrophic, with chlorophyll-a levels of up to 640 mu g/L. Assemblage structure showed large between-lake variation that was explained by both physical and biotic variables, with combinations of water depth, dissolved oxygen, dissolved nutrients, turbidity, and plankton densities accounting for 45-59% of the variation in abundance of the dominant species. Water depth and dissolved nutrient concentrations were the best predictors of species diversity and fish abundance. Periodic desiccation of shallow, vegetated oxbows created harsh conditions that favored small fishes that are efficient colonizers. The two youngest oxbows were relatively deep and contained a high diversity and biomass of fishes. Of the 42 fish species collected, several were largely restricted to oxbow lakes, and others were either entirely restricted to or common only in the river channel. The hood dynamics of Brazos River floodplain habitats are less predictable (both intra- and interannually) than are those of large temperate rivers that receive runoff from snowmelt or predictable spring rainfall. As a result, Brazos River oxbow lakes remain separated from the river channel for many months or years, such that faunal exchange between oxbows to the channel should be pulselike and irregular.					; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013	Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X													0002-8487					MAR	2000	129	2					451	468		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0451:FASIRT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0451:FASIRT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000088635900009

This two year study (2008-2010) was undertaken to determine dry matter productivity and N uptake of two winter cover crops: ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and Chinese milkvetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) and their effects on soil properties as well as two subsequent rice (Oryza sativa L.) crops in Dongting Lake Plain in Hunan, China. Cover crops were broadcast sown in October, approximately 10 d before the harvest of late rice. Ryegrass was first cut in March and finally harvested in April coincident with the plough of milkvetch. Two consecutive rice crops were grown following the cover crops without application of chemical N. Averaged over two years, ryegrass produced more aboveground dry matter and accumulated higher amounts of N than milkvetch (4.7 Mg ha(-1) vs. 2.4 Mg ha(-1), 128 kg ha(-1) vs. 71 kg ha(-1)). Compared to CK (bare fallow without weed), both ryegrass (RG) and milkvetch (CMV) treated plots had lower soil bulk density at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths. At the harvest of cover crops, CMV increased soil NH4+-N concentration at 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depths. In contrast, RG decreased soil NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations in the three depths. Averaged over four sampling dates in the double rice seasons in 2010, soil microbial biomass C was slightly different between RG (257 mg kg(-1)) and CMV (249 mg kg(-1)), and these were significantly higher than CK (218 mg kg(-1)). Soil microbial biomass N was highest for CMV (15.4 mg kg(-1)), followed by RG (11.3 mg kg(-1)) and CK (6.1 mg kg(-1)). Grain yield and total N yield of early rice were 0.6 Mg ha(-1) and 11 kg ha(-1) higher for CMV, respectively, and 1.0 Mg ha(-1) and 20 kg ha(-1) lower for RG as compared with CK averaged over years. Grain yield and total N yield of late rice were not significantly affected by cover crops.

The natural variability of these compounds in zooplankton has been related to temperature, radiation and diet, but the ultimate mechanisms regulating the observed patterns in the field are still unclear. In this study, we analysed the variability of carotenoids and MAAs in a population of the calanoid copepod Boeckella antiqua in a shallow pond located in Northern Patagonia (Argentina). During our field survey, carotenoids and MAAs in B. antiqua varied without a clear seasonal pattern. Nevertheless, both groups of PPCs reached their maxima during spring and minima during summer. Inverse relationships were found between carotenoid concentrations versus temperature and irradiance. For MAAs, the same relationships were not significant. Tolerance experiments showed that mortality of B. antiqua was significantly influenced both by temperature and UVB dose, being more vulnerable at high temperature. We further investigated the effect of radiation regime and temperature on the bioaccumulation of PPCs in controlled laboratory experiments. We found that the concentrations of PPCs could be experimentally modified by manipulating radiation exposure and temperature. In addition, by breaking down the bioaccumulation processes into uptake and elimination, we were able to show that (i) the uptake rate was stimulated by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)+UVA exposure and (ii) both uptake and elimination rates increased with temperature. Thus, the net accumulation (i.e. the balance between uptake and elimination), which ultimately dictates the concentration observed in an animal, could be either positive or negative depending on the specific combination of radiation exposure and temperature. The dual regulation of PPCs by radiation exposure and temperature should be considered in future efforts to reconstruct or predict the photoprotective responses of aquatic organisms to the past or future climate scenarios.					; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/NTQ-2898-2025; Garcia, Patricia/AAL-4453-2020	Dieguez, Maria/0000-0002-8241-3719; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/0000-0003-2334-4191; Garcia, Patricia Elizabeth/0000-0002-1471-3090; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	2008	30	7					817	827		10.1093/plankt/fbn041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbn041													WOS:000257964700008

The current conceptual model for management of Walleye Sander vitreus in Green Bay designates Walleye in the northern and southern parts of the bay as distinct stocks, with little mixing between the northern and southern fisheries, and assumes that Walleye in both northern and southern Green Bay primarily spawn in tributaries as opposed to shoreline or offshore reef areas. We used acoustic telemetry to test this conceptual model for Walleye management in Green Bay. Telemetry indicated that the majority of Green Bay Walleye use tributaries for spawning. However, many individuals were assigned to open-water spawning locations during consecutive years in both northern (26%) and southern (21%) Green Bay, suggesting that open-water spawners may represent a larger proportion of the Walleye stocks than previously thought. Differential movement was observed between northern and southern portions of Green Bay, with 56% of Walleye tagged in northern Green Bay crossing receiver lines to move south compared to only 19% of Walleye tagged in southern Green Bay crossing receiver lines to move north. Walleye typically transitioned across these boundaries in summer and fall, suggesting that stock contributions to the fishery in each zone may differ seasonally. Differential movements of northern Green Bay Walleye may be influenced by broad-scale differences in habitat and prey availability, which are likely related to the differential effects of dreissenid mussel invasion in Green Bay. Our results suggest that adjustment of monitoring efforts to account for open-water spawners may provide a more complete picture of stock status. Additionally, more research examining potential food web effects of northern Green Bay Walleye moving into southern Green Bay may be needed to determine how these movements might influence other important species.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Izzo, Lisa/0000-0002-2965-5161; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2023	43	3					695	714		10.1002/nafm.10883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10883		MAY 2023											WOS:000983987700001
J	Heggenes, J; Baglinière, JL; Cunjak, RA				Heggenes, J; Baglinière, JL; Cunjak, RA			Spatial niche variability for young Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S-trutta) in heterogeneous streams	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Habitat is important in determining stream carrying capacity and population density in young Atlantic salmon and brown trout. We review stream habitat selection studies and relate results to variable and interacting abiotic and biotic factors. The importance of spatial and temporal scales an often overlooked. Different physical variables may influence fish position choice at different spatial scales. Temporally variable water flows and temperatures are pervasive environmental factors in streams that affect behavior and habitat selection. The more frequently measured abiotic variables are water depth, water velocity (or stream gradient), substrate particle size, and cover. Summer daytime, feeding habitats of Atlantic salmon are size structured. Larger parr (greater-than 7 cm) have a wider spatial niche than small parr. Selected snout water velocities are consistently low (3-25 cm.s(-1)). Mean (or surface) water velocities are in the preferred range of 3050 cm.s(-1), and usually in combination with coarse substratum (16-256 mm). However, salmon parr demonstrate flexibility with respect to preferred water velocity, depending on fish size, intra- and interspecific competition, and predation risk. Water depth is less important, except in small streams. In large rivers and lakes a variety of water depths are used by salmon parr. Summer daytime, feeding habitat of brown trout is also characterized by a narrow selection of low snout water velocities. Habitat use is size-structured, which appears to be mainly a result of intraspecific competition. The small trout parr (less-than 7 cm) are abundant in the shallow swift stream areas (less-than 20-30 cm depths, 10-50 cm.s(-1) water velocities) with cobble substrates. The larger trout have increasingly strong preferences for deep-slow stream areas, in particular pools. Water depth is considered the most important habitat variable for brown trout. Spatial niche overlap is considerable where the two species are sympatric, although young Atlantic salmon tend to be distributed more in the faster flowing and shallow habitats compared with trout. Habitat use by salmon is restricted through interspecific competition with the more aggressive brown trout (interactive segregation). However, subtle innate differences in behavior at an early stage also indicate selective segregation. Seasonal changes in habitat use related to water temperatures occur in both species. In winter, they have a stronger preference for cover and shelter, and may seek shelter in the streambed and/or deeper water. At low temperatures (higher latitudes), there are also marked shifts in habitat use during day and night as the fish become nocturnal. Passive sheltering in the substrate or aggregating in deep-slow stream areas is the typical daytime behavior. While active at night, the fish move to more exposed holding positions primarily on but also above the substrate. Diurnal changes in habitat use take place also in summer; brown trout may utilize a wider spatial niche at night with more fish occupying the shallow-slow stream areas. Brown trout and young Atlantic salmon also exhibit a flexible response to variability in streamflows, wherein habitat selection may change considerably. Important topics in need of further research include: influence of spatial measurement scale, effects of temporal and spatial variability in habitat conditions on habitat selection, effects of interactive competition and trophic interactions (predation risk) on habitat selection, influence of extreme natural events on habitat selection use or suitability (floods, ice formation and jams, droughts), and individual variation in habitat use or behavior.																			0906-6691					MAR	1999	8	1					1	21		10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00048.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00048.x													WOS:000078789800001

The ESNT was completed in 2013. It was expanded from the existing Northern Jiangsu Water Transfer Project (NJWT), which had been in place since the 1960s. We observed invasions of two estuarine gobiids, Taenioides cirratus (Blyth, 1860) and Tridentiger bifasciatus (Steindachner, 1881), into the linked lakes. Taenioides cirratus was first reported in Luoma Lake in 2005 and Nansi Lake in 2011. Tridentiger bifasciatus was first observed in Luoma and Nansi lakes in 2015 and in Dongping Lake in 2016. Invasion of T. cirratus was probably associated with the operation of the NJWT, and then enhanced by operation of the ESNT. Invasion of T. bifasciatus was associated with operation of the ESNT. The ESNT/NJWT is mainly operated during winter and spring when the Yangtze River is at the annual minimum discharge. Impoundment of reservoirs at the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries has dramatically reduced river discharge, which induces saltwater intrusion upstream to the donor area of the ESNT. Thus, estuarine gobiids can reach the donor region, and be dispersed upstream through water diversion.

It is important to evaluate their invasive risks in the future.

The long-tailed duck is a circumpolar sea duck, often with longitudinal migratory routes between wintering and breeding sites. In recent decades the species has been in decline throughout its range and it is now classified as vulnerable. In Iceland, the breeding population is 2000-3000 individuals, but the winter population is considerably larger (> 110,000) with wintering birds coming from other areas. To identify the phylogeographic origin of the species in Iceland, for both the breeding and the wintering population, variation in the control region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was analyzed and compared with samples obtained from across the species range. Two distinct lineages of the control region were found in Iceland, one of which occurred at high frequency in the Icelandic breeding population. The haplotype lineage found in high frequency in the breeding population in Iceland was absent or in low frequencies elsewhere, except in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska. The patterns observed in the mitochondria may reflect an overall genetic divergence of the Icelandic breeding population from the other sites studied or alternatively sexual differences in philopatry which may only affect the maternally transmitted markers.

We explored, using the process-based lake model MyLake, how changes in these pressures modulate ice phenology and the dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) of a small boreal humic lake. The model was parametrized against year-round time series of water temperature and DO from a lake buoy. Observed trends in air temperature (+0.045 degrees C yr(-1)) and DOC concentration (0.11 mg C L-1 yr(-1), +1% annually) over the past 40 years were used as model forcings. A backcast of ice freezing and breakup dates revealed that ice breakup occurred on average 8 days earlier in 2014 than in 1974. The earlier ice breakup enhanced water column ventilation resulting in higher DO in the spring. Warmer water in late summer led to longer anoxic periods, as microbial DOC turnover increased. A long-term increase in DOC concentrations caused a decline in lake DO, leading to 15% more hypoxic days (<3 mg L-1) and 10% more anoxic days (<15 mu g L-1) in 2014 than in 1974. We conclude that climate warming and increasing DOC loads are antagonistic with respect to their effect on DO availability. The model suggests that DOC is a stronger driver of DO consumption than temperature. The browning of lakes may thus cause reductions in the oxythermal habitat of fish and aquatic biota in boreal lakes.

A 60,000-year record of hydrologic variability in the Central Andes from the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf waxes in Lake Titicaca sediments	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												A record of the hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial leaf waxes (delta D-wax) in sediment cores from Lake Titicaca provides new insight into the precipitation history of the Central Andes and controls of South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) variability since the last glacial period. Comparison of the delta D-wax record with a 19-kyr delta D record from the nearby Illimani ice core supports the interpretation that precipitation delta D is the primary control on delta D-wax with a lesser but significant role for local evapotranspiration and other secondary influences on delta D-wax. The Titicaca delta D-wax record confirms overall wetter conditions in the Central Andes during the last glacial period relative to a drier Holocene. During the last deglaciation, abrupt delta D-wax shifts correspond to millennial-scale events observed in the high-latitude North Atlantic, with dry conditions corresponding to the Bolling-Allerod and early Holocene periods and wetter conditions during late glacial and Younger Dryas intervals. We observe a trend of increasing monsoonal precipitation from the early to the late Holocene, consistent with summer insolation forcing of the SASM, but similar hydrologic variability on precessional timescales is not apparent during the last glacial period. Overall, this study demonstrates the relative importance of high-latitude versus tropical forcing as a dominant control on glacial SASM precipitation variability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Donaldson, JA; Guerstein, PG; Mueller, W				Donaldson, JA; Guerstein, PG; Mueller, W			Facies analysis of a pumiceous terrace beside Klutlan Glacier, Yukon Territory	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Dacitic pumice forms discontinuous terraces along both sides of Klutlan Glacier, which emanates from Mount Churchill, Alaska. Mount Churchill is the eruptive source of the White River Ash, an extensive tephra deposit accumulated similar to 1200 and 1900 BP during two plinian eruptions. Composition, texture, primary structures, and lack of induration suggest that, apart from a locally preserved cover of air-fall tephra, the Klutlan pumice deposits are resedimented proximal equivalents of the White River Ash. The pumice terraces display large-scale crossbedding, normal and inverse graded bedding, channels, and both linguoid and climbing ripples, all sedimentary structures characteristic of subaqueous deposition. In addition, many of the pyroclasts are subround and show a wide variation in sorting from bed to bed, in contrast to the uniformly angular to subangular texture of well-sorted pyroclasts in an air-fall ash layer that caps the terraces. This uppermost tephra unit, up to 1 m thick, is attributed to the last major eruption of Mount Churchill. The underlying resedimented pumice deposits are attributed to deposition by meltwater produced as a result of substantial melting of the snow and ice fields below Mount Churchill, the headward region of Klutlan Glacier, in response to increased heat flow immediately before the last eruption. The terraces stand more than 100 m above the present surface of Klutlan Glacier, indicating that substantial melting has occurred since the time of terrace deposition. In comparison to present-day conditions, this implies a prolonged cold climate before accumulation of the pumice terraces in glacier-margin channels. An alternative explanation is that Klutlan Glacier may have been catastrophically thickened as a result of glacial surging in response to elevated heat flow during eruptions of Mount Churchill. Meltwater backed up behind one or more ice dams could have created temporary lakes in which detached segments of Klutlan Glacier locally abutted against and (or) scoured the shorelines, thus explaining the discontinuous nature of the pumice terraces. Rapid deposition of the pumice terraces, perhaps during a single winter, is inferred from an almost complete lack in the terraces of lithoclasts derived from the steep talus-covered slopes of Klutlan's U-shaped valley.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1996	33	9					1233	1242		10.1139/e96-093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e96-093													WOS:A1996VQ08300001

Nutrient and mercury deposition and storage in an alpine snowpack of the Sierra Nevada, USA	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Biweekly snowpack core samples were collected at seven sites along two elevation gradients in the Tahoe Basin during two consecutive snow years to evaluate total wintertime snowpack accumulation of nutrients and pollutants in a high-elevation watershed of the Sierra Nevada. Additional sampling of wet deposition and detailed snow pit profiles were conducted the following year to compare wet deposition to snowpack storage and assess the vertical dynamics of snowpack nitrogen, phosphorus, and mercury. Results show that, on average, organic N comprised 48% of all snowpack N, while nitrate (NO3--N) and TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) made up 25 and 27%, respectively. Snowpack NO3--N concentrations were relatively uniform across sampling sites over the sampling seasons and showed little difference between seasonal wet deposition and integrated snow pit concentrations. These patterns are in agreement with previous studies that identify wet deposition as the dominant source of wintertime NO3--N deposition. However, vertical snow pit profiles showed highly variable concentrations of NO3--N within the snowpack indicative of additional deposition and in-snowpack dynamics. Unlike NO3--N, snowpack TAN doubled towards the end of winter, which we attribute to a strong dry deposition component which was particularly pronounced in late winter and spring. Organic N concentrations in the snowpack were highly variable (from 35 to 70%) and showed no clear temporal, spatial, or vertical trends throughout the season. Integrated snowpack organic N concentrations were up to 2.5 times higher than seasonal wet deposition, likely due to microbial immobilization of inorganic N as evident by coinciding increases in organic N and decreases in inorganic N in deeper, aged snow. Spatial and temporal deposition patterns of snowpack P were consistent with particulate-bound dry deposition inputs and strong impacts from in-basin sources causing up to 6 times greater enrichment at urban locations compared to remote sites. Snowpack Hg showed little temporal variability and was dominated by particulate-bound forms (78% on average). Dissolved Hg concentrations were consistently lower in snowpack than in wet deposition, which we attribute to photochemically driven gaseous re-emission. In agreement with this pattern is a significant positive relationship between snowpack Hg and elevation, attributed to a combination of increased snow accumulation at higher elevations causing limited light penetration and lower photochemical re-emission losses in deeper, higher-elevation snowpack. Finally, estimates of basin-wide loading based on spatially extrapolated concentrations and a satellite-based snow water equivalent reconstruction model identify snowpack chemical loading from atmospheric deposition as a substantial source of nutrients and pollutants to the Lake Tahoe Basin, accounting for 113 t of N, 9.3 t of P, and 1.2 kg of Hg each year.

In the period 1925-1985 sediment core diatom inferred pH has fallen from 5.8 to 4.8. During the same period observed pH fell from 6 to 4.2 and plankton two diatom inferred pH fell from 5.7 to 4.2. To date, this is one of the fastest documented rates of acidification of any pool or lake in temperate regions exposed to acid rain. Our results indicate that useful stratigraphic information can be obtained from an analysis of the organic sediments of even a very shallow (mean depth 0.6 m) pool. Although there is evidence of downward displacement of sediments in such shallow water bodies, this process does not completely homogenize the sediment record. The accuracy of the reconstruction is substantially improved by a multidisciplinary approach.

J	Siles, GL; Leconte, R				Siles, Gabriela Llanet; Leconte, Robert			Reservoir Ice Conditions from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing and ERA5-Land: The Manicouagan Hydroelectric Reservoir Case Study	HYDROLOGY												Reservoir ice can have an important impact on the watershed scale and influence hydraulic operations. On the other hand, hydropower generation can also impact the ice regime. In this study, multi-source satellite and ERA5-land data are used to evaluate ice conditions. Specifically, ice-controlling variables (temperature, water levels), ice regime (cover/deformation, thickness) and their interrelations are assessed for a 5-year period from 2017 to 2021. The methodology is applied to the Manicouagan reservoir, one of the largest hydropower reservoirs in Quebec, Canada. The satellite-based land surface temperatures (LSTs) suggest that winter 2021 was the hottest one. Overall, MODIS and Landsat LSTs agree with the ERA5-land temperatures. Ice backscatter from Sentinel-1 indicates that, in general, the reservoir is completely covered by ice from January to March. A correlation of 0.6 and 0.8 is observed between C- and Ku-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal and ice thickness, respectively. Important ice changes inferred from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) occur approximately at the position where the largest ERA5-land ice thickness differences are observed. Winter water levels are also evaluated using satellite altimetric data to verify their influence on the ice dynamics. They show a decreasing tendency as the winter advances.																				2306-5338				MAY 11	2023	10	5							108	10.3390/hydrology10050108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology10050108													WOS:000997187500001

To offer insights into potential lake responses under differing Maumee River loads and reveal recent changes with time, we explored patterns in phosphorus and chlorophyll a data from 2008 to 2018 collected in western Lake Erie near the mouth of the Maumee River. We found high, but relatively stable Maumee River and lake concentrations of total P (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) with no discernable annual or seasonal patterns. Maumee spring TP load was not strongly related to lake TP, and lake SRP concentrations were positively but weakly related to SRP loads. Lake TP was a strong predictor of chlorophyll a, but the relationship was weaker at sites closer to the Maumee. These results highlight spatial differences both in P concentration and the relationship between TP and chlorophyll a, and these indicate that spring phosphorus loads are a weak algal biomass predictor in the portion of the western basin of Lake Erie represented by these sampling stations.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Rowland, Freya/AAE-4733-2021	Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301; Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Ruberg, Steven/0000-0001-8809-5689													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 21	2020	54	2					835	841		10.1021/acs.est.9b05326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b05326								31859490					WOS:000509419700020

First, ring widths must be related to the overall somatic growth of the organism. Second, ring widths must demonstrate synchrony of interannual growth variation among individuals within a population. Finally, fin ray rings and growth chronologies should be related to both interpopulation and interannual variations of known environmental factors. This research indicated that ring widths document variations in somatic growth. Average fin ray cross-sectional radii at age 25 were related to total length using data from seven populations sampled across North America. This investigation also suggested that growth ring widths were influenced by large-scale, population-wide, extrinsic factors in two ways. First, differences between populations in fin ray cross-sectional radii at age 25 were strongly correlated with mean annual, summer, and winter air temperatures. Second, growth chronologies developed from populations that demonstrate significant synchrony of interannual growth variations among members are consistently positively correlated to past air-temperature records. This research has provided evidence that growth rings contained in the cross section of the lake sturgeon pectoral fin ray can be used in the construction of growth chronologies.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2000	129	4					1018	1030		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1018:SOLSGR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1018:SOLSGR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000088652700010

Research on occurrence and behavior of EOCs in karst is in its infancy, thus policy measures and legislative control of these compounds in groundwater are still lacking. The Dinaric karst aquifers are an essential source of drinking water for almost half of Croatia's territory. Intense karstification, complex heterogeneous characteris-tics, and high fracture-cavernous porosity result in rapid, far-reaching groundwater flow and large karst springs, but also high intrinsic vulnerability due to low contaminant attenuation. To prioritize future monitoring and establish appropriate thresholds for EOCs detected in Croatian karst drinking water resources, in silico tools based on quantitative structure-activity relationships were used in PBT (persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity) and PMT/vPvM analyzes, while toxicological assessment helped identify potential threats to human health. In 33 samples collected during two sampling campaigns in 2019 at 16 karst springs and one lake used for water supply, we detected 65 compounds (EOCs and some legacy chemicals), of which 7 were classified as potentially PBT or vPvB compounds (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, boscalid, and azoxystrobin), while only 2 compounds were assessed as not PMT/vPvM. This finding underlines that most of detected EOCs potentially endanger karst (ground)water ecosystems and important drinking water sources in Croatia. Comparison of maximum concentrations with existing or derived drinking water guideline values revealed how 2 of 65 detected compounds represent a potential risk to human health at lifelong exposure (sulfadiazine and hydrochlorothia-zide), while 5 chemicals warrant additional human health impacts studies and groundwater monitoring.

Recaptures of individual marked turtles indicated seasonal movements due to changes in water levels of the different oxbow sections. Emigration from semipermanent hibernacula to outlying areas occurred in spring, as a response to the filling of these areas with water. Migration back to more permanent areas of water occurred when the outlying sections began to dry up in late June. Reasons for the emigrational movements from the permanent areas in spring may be crowning effects and the generally greater productivity effects and the generally greater productivity of aquatic plant material in the shallower, less permanent areas.																			0022-1511	1937-2418					1978	12	2					143	149		10.2307/1563400	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1563400													WOS:A1978FD08000003
J	PARSON, MJ; PARKER, BC				PARSON, MJ; PARKER, BC			SEASONAL PATTERN OF AMMONIUM (METHYLAMINE) UPTAKE BY PHYTOPLANKTON IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Our primary objective was to determine if a relationship existed between seasonal change in phytoplankton and high affinity for (K(m)) or uptake rates (V(max)) of ammonium which might explain seasonal phytoplankton succession in oligotrophic ecosystems. We measured ammonium uptake using [C-14]-methylamine and estimated K(m) and V(max) using Hanes Plots at 2-week intervals during 6 months of thermal stratification in Mountain lake, Virginia (37-degrees 22' N, 80-degrees 32' W). Community composition, nutrient levels, and other variables were determined in all uptake experiments. A second objective was to determine if ammonium was preferentially utilized over nitrate and to characterize further the ammonium transport system. V(max) increased steadily from May until the end of July, each increase coinciding with major changes in the phytoplankton community. Cryptophyceans dominated in May, chlorophyceans in June and July, and cyanophyceans from the end of July to late October. With cyanophycean dominance, V(max) declined until chlorophyceans reestablished dominance in late October. By contrast, K(m) values increased from May to the end of July, but thereafter showed no correlation. Acetylene reduction experiments showed no nitrogen fixation during late summer and fall when blue-green algae were present. Preference for ammonium was implied also by negative nitrate reductase assays. Overall, the coincidence of V(max) and K(m) values for [C-14]-methylamine uptake and changing phytoplankton community structure suggests the possibility that successive algal communities may be changing as a result of specific species differences in ammonium affinity and uptake rates.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 24	1993	250	2					105	117		10.1007/BF00008232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008232													WOS:A1993KP45000005
J	Thomas, JD; Eaton, P				Thomas, JD; Eaton, P			The spatio-temporal patterns and ecological significance of free amino acids and humic substances in contrasting oligotrophic and eutrophic freshwater ecosystems	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The concentrations of total and individual free amino-acids (TFAA, FAA) and humic substances (HS) were measured by HPLC in the midwater column (MWC), air-water interface (AWI) and sediment pore water (SPW) in the oligotrophic, dystrophic Isle of Thorns lake and the eutrophic Lewes Brooks drainage channel in East Sussex, UK, during each of the four seasons. Pesticide levels were low, usually below detection levels in both water bodies. At the temporal level there were tendencies for the concentration of both FAA and HS to be lowest in the winter months and for the HS concentrations to be higher in the autumn in both water bodies. At the spatial level the eutrophic Lewes Brooks was characterized by having much higher FAA/HS ratios than the oligotrophic Isle of Thorns lake and it is suggested that further comparative studies be undertaken to verify whether the FAA/HS ratios may have general application in the classification of water bodies on a trophic basis. The concentrations of TFAA are higher in the SPW and AWI than in the MWC in both water bodies and the HS concentrations are much higher in the SPW than in the MCW. Statistical analyses support the view that the FAA in the MWC are mainly derived from the SPW whereas the FAA in the AWI have a different origin. The data obtained is used to address the following questions: (a) How do the spatio-temporal patterns of FAA and HS in the present study areas compare with those of other water bodies? (b) What are the origins of the FAA and HS and how are their concentrations regulated? (c) Are the distributional patterns of FAA and HS of special significance to invertebrate detritivores?

Effects of Scale and Gender on Winter Habitat Selection by American Mink	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Mammalian carnivores have adapted to successfully occupy a wide range of environments spanning tropical to polar ecosystems. Some species, however, have evolved in ways that constrain their ability to thrive in extreme environmental conditions. For example many members of the Family Mustelidae are vulnerable to extreme temperatures resulting from their tubular body shape. The American mink (Neovison vison) likely faces these temperature constraints, being a smaller-bodied mustelid that ranges over a large portion of North America. Mink are largely understudied in its native range with knowledge being particularly sparse with respect to winter ecology. During 2011-2012 we conducted winter telemetry on seven adult mink and used resource selection function models to assess habitat selection patterns while considering spatial extent and gender. We found that at a larger extent, the animals' use of habitat was strongly linked to riparian features, whereas this effect was less noticeable at a finer scale. The larger males selected more lakeshore habitat, whereas the smaller females generally were near smaller streams with both selecting for beaver modified habitat. While we recognize the limited sample size in our study, we speculate that this spatial separation could be linked to higher energetic costs for females to forage aquatically in winter because of their smaller body size. This may make females more sensitive to competition from other forest carnivores (e.g. American marten) as well as impacts from resource development activities.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2018	179	2					261	274																WOS:000429137400007

To provide new insight into the impact of rainfall on glacial hydrology, here we present hydro-meteorological and time-series observations of meltwater stable water isotope compositions from the snout of the Chorabari glacier in the Upper Ganga Basin, Central Himalayas across the ablation season corresponding to 2019. We observe that rainfall events (>2 mm d(-1)) on the glacier enhance discharge driven by ice meltwater in River Mandakini. Energy balance calculations reveal that one of the drivers behind enhanced ice meltwater contribution could be rain-induced melting of the glacier where rainfall on the ice surface melts the glacier producing up to 13% of the total discharge at the glacier snout. Further, rainfall on glacier surface have other control on glacial processes-for example, snow metamorphism, ice flow dynamics such as short-term acceleration in ice speed flow, and reorganization of the englacial and subglacial drainage network-that are poorly studied and needs further investigation. We conclude rainfall events on the glacier have a complex control on mountain hydrology. This study, therefore, provides an interpretative framework that calls for additional assessments of the direct and indirect impact of rainfall in glacial hydrology.

Hourly averaged PM(2.5) mass data were collected during two sampling periods (summer 2000 and winter 2002) using a real-time total ambient mass sampler (RAMS), sample equilibration system (SES)-tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), and conventional TEOM monitor. This paper compares the results obtained from the various monitoring systems, which differ in their treatment of semivolatile material (SVM; particle-bound water, semivolatile ammonium nitrate, and semivolatile organic compounds). PM,., mass results obtained by the RAMS were consistently higher than those obtained by the SES-TEOM and conventional TEOM monitors because of the RAMS abilit to measure semivolatile ammonium nitrate and semivolatile organic material but not particle-bound water. The SESTEOM monitoring system was able to account for an average of 28% of the SVM, whereas the conventional TEOM monitor loses essentially all of the SVM from the single filter during sampling. Occasional mass readings by the various TEOM monitors that are higher than RAMS results may reflect particle-bound water, which, under some conditions, is measured by the TEOM but not the RAMS.																			1047-3289					DEC	2005	55	12					1839	1846											16408688					WOS:000234055800006

The North Atlantic storm track generally follows the Gulf Stream and terminates near southeast Greenland and Iceland as the Icelandic Low. The Icelandic Low is the main driver of the North Atlantic Oscillation, particularly during winter months as the baroclinic zone expands to lower latitudes, correlating with temperature and precipitation in many areas around the North Atlantic. Understanding how atmospheric circulation, temperature, and precipitation changes in this region is important to build robust projections of how these variables will change, especially under natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here, climate proxies correlating to the Icelandic Low, summer air temperature, and annual precipitation build an understanding of how these variables changed over the last 2000 years. Through the natural climate shifts of this period - Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages Cold Period, Medieval Climate Anomaly, and Little Ice Age - it is shown that storm frequency decreases as temperature increases and the Icelandic Low increases in pressure (i.e., becomes weaker). However, these climate changes are not simultaneous, and their amplitudes are not similar across the region. Keeping regionality rather than a pan-Arctic average better explains natural variability of each subregion and how each sub-region has evolved climatically due to anthropogenic forcings of greenhouse gases.

J	Pirajno, F; Grey, K				Pirajno, F; Grey, K			Chert in the Palaeoproterozoic Bartle Member, Killara Formation, Yerrida Basin, Western Australia: a rift-related playa lake and thermal spring environment?	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Palaeoproterozoic chert in the Bartle Member of the Killara Formation, Yerrida Group, Yerrida Basin of Western Australia, contains an anomalous association of crystal structures and rock fabrics that are difficult to interpret. The association appears to indicate an evaporitic-pyroclastic-thermal-spring environment associated with rifting at about 2.2 Ga. The chert member contains silica pseudomorphs after evaporite minerals that in places enclose relict isolated crystals and aggregates of crystals of gypsum and anhydrite. The evaporite minerals are associated with minerals such as barite and analcime. The association of these minerals, together with palaeoenvironmental evidence, invites comparison with rocks of the Afar region and Lake Magadi in the East African Rift System. The Bartle Member locally contains anomalous gold (up to twelve times the average crustal values of 4 ppb) and barium. It also contains finely disseminated kerogen together with numerous spheroids (classified here as microdubiofossils) and some curious structures showing organisation into complex petal-like structures (classified here as putative microfossils). The Bartle Member chert has many characteristics of playa lake and thermal-spring deposits, and may host epithermal precious-metal mineralisation.

Assessing dominant uncertainties in urban buildup/washoff processes under climate change: A case study in Western Switzerland	URBAN CLIMATE												Urban runoff is often contaminated. The interval, duration and intensity of rainfalls control the transport of pollutants. Future climate change will modify both frequency and intensity of rain events. Consequently, the concentration of pollutants in future runoff driven by buildup/washoff processes will be affected by such changes. We investigated to what extent modifications in future rainfall distributions will impact the pollutant concentration in urban surface runoff. Three emissions scenarios, multiple combinations of RCM/GCMs and modifications to rain event frequencies were used to simulate possible future rainfall distributions with various characteristics. Simulated rainfall timeseries were used as inputs for four pairs of buildup/washoff models, in order to compare future surface runoff pollution concentrations. We demonstrated that urban runoff pollution undergoes a perceptible increase in summer, and a decrease in winter, when runoff is more dilute due to rain water. The climate scenario chosen led to a higher source of uncertainty in the median runoff water quality estimates. The setting of b/w model parameters has minimal impact on predicted mean and median concentrations. However for the high concentration limit, the main sources of uncertainty differ, indicating that the choice of the water quality model dominates the source of uncertainties for extreme events.

Consequences of the Aral Sea restoration for its present physical state: temperature, mixing, and oxygen regime	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The restoration of the North Aral Sea was an unprecedented effort to save a large water basin by construction of a dam that separates it from the rest of the desiccating Aral Sea area. As a result, the lake volume has stabilized at 27.5 km3, the area has increased from 2800 km2 (2006) to 3400 km2 (2020), and the salinity has dropped from 18 to 10 gkg-1. The consequences of this unique experiment include highly dynamic changes in the thermal conditions, seasonal stratification, ice regime, and dissolved oxygen content and remain not fully quantified to date. We analyze the current state of the North Aral Sea with regard to stabilization of its long-term dynamics. We further consider the possible future projections in view of the global change effects on the regional hydrological regime and potential water management measures. Using data from a series of expeditions to the North Aral Sea in 2016-2019 and year-long continuous monitoring of the thermal and oxygen regime by an autonomous mooring station, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the North Aral system behavior on seasonal to interannual scales after its restoration. We demonstrate that the present seasonal mixing regime is distinguished by relatively weak summer thermal stratification occupying about 7 % of the lake volume. Salinity does not contribute to the summer density stratification, but a stable salinity stratification can develop during ice melt in late winter. On the background of weak thermal stratification, highly energetic internal waves with periods of similar to 4.5 d dominate the near-bottom dynamics and facilitate mixing at the lake bottom. As a result, the bulk of the water column remains well-saturated with oxygen throughout the year. However, low oxygen conditions may develop in the deepest part of the lake in midsummer. In summary, the mixing regime of the restarted lake favors vertical transport of dissolved matter and water-sediment mass exchange, ensuring oxygenation of deep waters and supply of nutrients to the upper water column. While the North Aral Sea is restored to a well-mixed state similar to that before its desiccation started, its seasonal mixing regime is currently in unstable equilibrium, wobbling between polymictic and dimictic conditions. The fragility of this seasonal pattern is demonstrated by modeling results: slight changes in the water level or transparency may turn the Aral Sea to a steadily dimictic or polymictic state.

J	Jurvelius, J; Sammalkorpi, I				Jurvelius, J; Sammalkorpi, I			Hydroacoustic monitoring of the distribution, density and the mass-removal of pelagic fish in a eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A large scale biomanipulation of pelagic fish by trawling was started in the eutrophic Enonselka basin (26 km(2)) of Lake Vesijarvi to improve the water quality which had remained poor in spite of the termination of nutrient loading. The distribution and density of the fish were studied by hydroacoustics before and during the removal. The initial annual fish density varied between 13 000-21 000 fish ha(-1) in the study area in August 1984-89. The mass-removal of the fish by pelagic trawling took place in 1989-1992. The catch varied annually between 64 and 92 kg ha(-1). Roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus (L.)) accounted for c. 85% of the weight of the catch. The mass-removal decreased the pelagic fish density in the Enonselka basin during the trawling. An increase in the density was observed after the trawling ceased in these years, and the initial density level was reached within one month. The density level after mass-removal remained high compared with oligotrophic lakes. The pelagic fish had a diurnal ascending trend with the decreasing light intensity in August, and the fish were significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the water mass in temperature non-stratified water in autumn than in stratified water in summer. The fish were somewhat deeper in the years of mass-removal than before it. Mass-removal did not affect the individual length of the echosurveyed fish. Fish smaller than c. 15 cm (TS < -44 dB; mainly smelt) were numerically dominant throughout the whole study period.																			0018-8158					DEC 1	1995	316	1					33	41		10.1007/BF00019373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019373													WOS:A1995TU89800002

Samples were collected monthly between December 2012 and March 2013 at seven sampling stations located around Lake Chini. The samples were filtered to separate the dissolved and undissolved solids. The ionic compositions (NO3-, SO42-, Cl- and NH4+) were determined using ion chromatography (IC) while major elements (K, Na, Ca and Mg) and trace metals (Zn, Fe, Al, Ni, Mn, Cr, Pb and Cd) were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the average concentration of total solids around Lake Chini was 93.49 +/- 16.16 mg/(m(2).day). SO42-, Na and Zn dominated the dissolved portion of the dust fall. The enrichment factors (EF) revealed that the source of the trace metals and major elements in the rain water was anthropogenic, except for Fe. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) classified the seven monitoring stations and 16 variables into five groups and three groups respectively. A coupled receptor model, principal component analysis multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR), revealed that the sources of dust fall in Lake Chini were dominated by agricultural and biomass burning (42%), followed by the earth's crust (28%), sea spray (16%) and a mixture of soil dust and vehicle emissions (14%).

Nine taxa of colorless Euglenophyta are presented as a result of a taxonomic study in lentic environments (lagoons, wetlands, pond, and canal) of two areas near Patos Lagoon: Casamento Lake and associated ecosystems (30 degrees 03'-30 degrees 34'S; 50 degrees 25'-50 degrees 47'W) and the Butiazal de Tapes region (30 degrees 23'-30 degrees 38'S; 51 degrees 16'-51 degrees 29'W) on the Coastal Plains of Rio Grande do Sul. Sampling with nets and pressed macrophytes were carried out during fall and spring 2003. All nine taxa are new reports for the Coastal Plains of the state, where Cyclidiopsis acus Korsch. Entosiphon polyaulax Skuja, Gyropaigne kosmos Skuja, Menoidium tortuosum (Stokes) Lemm. var. playfairii Bour. and Rhabdomonas mirabilis (Playf.) Schroeckh, Lee & Patterson are first reports for Brazil, and Menoidium gracile Playf., Menoidium pellucidum Perty and Menoidium obtusum Pringheim for Rio Grande do Sul. The wetland ecosystem had the highest richness, where seven of the nine identified taxa were found in the wetlands between Capivari and Casamento lakes. The Casamento Lake area had higher richness of colorless Euglenophyta than the habitats in the Butiazal de Tapes region, probably because Casamento Lake received a higher anthropic contribution.																			0102-3306					OCT-DEC	2009	23	4					1076	1083		10.1590/S0102-33062009000400017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0102-33062009000400017													WOS:000273293800017
J	Moreira, AL; Taylor, EB				Moreira, Amanda L.; Taylor, Eric B.			The origin and genetic divergence of "black" kokanee, a novel reproductive ecotype of Oncorhynchus nerka	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Kokanee and sockeye salmon are the freshwater-resident and anadromous forms, respectively, of Oncorhynchus nerka. Unique populations of "black" kokanee are found in Lake Saiko, Japan, and in Anderson and Seton lakes in the southwestern interior of British Columbia. They are distinct from other populations of O. nerka in that black kokanee display black nuptial colouration and they spawn between 20 to 70 m below the surface of lakes in the winter or early spring. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nine microsatellite loci supported the hypothesis that black kokanee in Lake Saiko and in Anderson and Seton lakes have had a diphyletic origin resulting from at least two episodes of divergence in the North Pacific basin. Further, black kokanee in the Anderson and Seton lakes system were genetically distinct from sympatric populations of sockeye salmon in Gates and Portage creeks (inlets to Anderson and Seton lakes, respectively) and were distinct from one another. Anderson and Seton lake black kokanee differed dramatically from one another in standard length at maturity, but no differences were found between the two populations in size-adjusted maximum body depth or in gill raker numbers. Independent origins of black kokanee represent novel diversity within O. nerka, are consistent with the importance of parallel evolution in the origin of biodiversity, and suggest that independent management regimes are required for the persistence of black kokanee biodiversity within a physically interconnected lake system.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2015	72	10					1584	1595		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0145													WOS:000361828400014

Reproductive phenology and the influence of temperature in two sympatric New Zealand freshwater mussel species	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Context. Phenology plays a key role in shaping population dynamics, community structure and evolutionary adaptations. For freshwater mussels that rely on a parasitic larval (glochidia) phase on fish, shifts in reproductive phenology driven by environmental conditions may result in mismatches between glochidia release and host fish availability. Aims. We investigated intra- and interspecific reproductive timing variations in sympatric Echyridella aucklandica and E. menziesii, and identified thermal cues (accumulated degree days, ADD) associated with brooding and glochidia maturation. Methods. Brooding activity and glochidia maturation were assessed fortnightly-monthly over 1 year within four New Zealand streams. Results. The previously unknown phenology of E. aucklandica showed earlier brooding (May-July) and longer gravidity (9-11 months) than for E. menziesii (August; 6-7 months). Both species exhibited peak brooding in late austral spring-summer (November-December). ADD played a key role in regulating the timing of brooding onset in both species, as evidenced by the narrow ADD range observed across sites, and the relationship between ADD and brooding onset in both species. Conclusion. The demonstrated link between ADD and reproductive phenology has broad implications in the context of climate change. Specifically, it raises concerns about potential timing mismatches in glochidia release and host-fish availability, which could affect the survival and reproductive success of freshwater mussels.

J	Chow-Fraser, P				Chow-Fraser, P			Ecosystem response to changes in water level of Lake Ontario marshes: lessons from the restoration of Cootes Paradise Marsh	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th INTECOL International Wetland Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS	Utrecht Univ, Landscape Ecol Grp, Int & Natl Sci Comm				A general understanding of how aquatic vegetation responds to water-level fluctuations is needed to guide restoration of Great Lakes coastal wetlands because inter-annual and seasonal variations often confound effects of costly remedial actions. In 1997, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was removed from Cootes Paradise Marsh (L. Ontario) to reduce sediment resuspension and bioturbation, and thus regenerate marsh plants that had declined dramatically since the 1930s. Data from 1934 to 1993 were re-assembled from the literature to relate percentage cover of emergent vegetation to mean summer water level. A non-linear regression equation explained close to 90% of the variation compared with 80% for a non-linear equation, and this trend was confirmed for the dominant species, Typha latifolia. A modest recovery of emergent vegetation in 1999 following carp exclusion could have been predicted from declining water level alone, without invoking any effects of the biomampulation. An unusually cool spring in 1997 delayed the migration of spawning planktivores into the marsh. This resulted in a grazer-mediated clear-water phase that coincided with a resurgence of the submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) community in 1997, which declined again in 1999 when low water levels occurred. Even though decrease in water level was significantly related to increased suspended solids and greater light attenuation, light conditions appeared to have been adequate in marsh embayments to support SAV growth, according to a published relationship between maximum depth of SAV colonization and light extinction coefficient. I suggest that wave disturbance and propagule burial associated with shallow water depths may have been the main reasons for the decline of the SAV in 1999 and 2000.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 1	2005	539						189	204		10.1007/s10750-004-4868-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-4868-1													WOS:000231029600020

The impoundment destratified between May 31, 1975 and June 14, interrupting summer stratification. Mean summer chlorophyll concentrations were significantly lower in 1975 (133.0 mg/m3, 1974; 26.0 mg/m3, 1975). Assimilation numbers were significantly higher in 1975 (0.70 mgC/mg chlorophyll per h, 1974; 1.45 mgC/mg chlorophyll per h, 1975). There was no significant difference between pmax or total P means for the summer periods. There were significant differences in total inorganic C means during the mid-July to autumnal overturn periods (2.04 mg/l, 1975; 1.42 mg/l, 1974; 0.77 mg/l, 1973). Regression analyses indicated that chlorophyll concentrations demonstrated a significant positive relationship with total P only in the 2 late periods that had the lower total inorganic C concentrations. Several literature P-chlorophyll models applied to Spruce Knob Lake data predicted mean summer chlorophyll levels with varying degrees of success; the best predictions were obtained with models incorporating hydrologic regime effects. Temperature and chlorophyll were the most important variables influencing pmax during the investigation. Assimilation numbers demonstrated a significant positive relationship with temperature and a significant negative relationship with chlorophyll on a yearly basis. Summer assimilation numbers were strongly influenced by pmax when chlorophyll levels remained below 50 mg/m3.																			0003-9136						1979	87	2					178	197																WOS:A1979HV45600005

A number of classical and sophisticated DNOM characterisation methodologies were used for this purpose. The explanatory capability of site characteristics on the variation in descriptors of DNOM, including elemental analysis (EA), DOC fractionation, SEC, CZE, CGE, UV/Vis- and FTIR spectra, FES, TLS, ESR, ESI/MS, C-13-CPMAS-NMR, potentiometric pH titration as well as functional characteristics such as biodegradability, and the response of macrophyte and PAH partitioning coefficients were evaluated. The sampling sites were all natural, coniferous, heathery-forested catchments with bogs, forming a climatic, anthropogenic deposition and proportional biotope cover gradient. Correlations to the main principal components, as well as a correlation matrix, singled out total S-deposition as the key explanatory site parameter, accounting for most of the variation in DNOM descriptors. Other significant factors were H+ concentration, length of growing season, biotope coverage (i.e., peatland/ or lake/watershed ratio), site elevation and TOC concentration. Total sulphur (S) deposition was strongly negatively correlated to the molecular weight, aromaticity, carboxylic acidity and sorption capacity of PAH. A greater proportion of lake and Histosol biotopes of the sampling sites were reflected in a greater aliphatic character of the DNOM. PCA clustering of samples from the same site in spring and fall showed a basic site-specific DNOM quality and a weak season effect. The Hasse diagram technique (a method of partial order theory) was used to show, for instance, how the relative Histosol coverage may determine NOM quality and, in turn, how this coincides with high macrophyte response.					; Luster, Jörg/AAK-5002-2021; Pflugmacher, Stephan/AHD-0910-2022; Kukkonen, Jussi/JHV-1650-2023; Schmitt-Kopplin, Philippe/H-6271-2011; Vogt, Rolf David/O-5282-2014	Steinberg, Christian E.W./0000-0002-3132-8901; Akkanen, Jarkko/0000-0001-9232-0121; Pflugmacher, Stephan/0000-0003-1052-2905; Schmitt-Kopplin, Philippe/0000-0003-0824-2664; Kukkonen, Jussi/0000-0003-3449-6828; Paul, Andrea/0000-0003-2849-4754; Vogt, Rolf David/0000-0001-8880-5177													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUN	2004	66	2					195	210		10.1007/s00027-004-0710-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-004-0710-0													WOS:000221932000006

The sedimentation rate was estimated using common tephra layers found both in Lake Mashu and in adjacent Lake Kussharo. From the depositional age of the upper common tephra (250 B.P.) obtained by Pb-210 dating of the Lake Kussharo core, the sedimentation rate of Lake Mashu was calculated to range 6.4 to 7.4 mg/cm2 y. Iron and Mn that originated from hot springs on the lake bottom are oxidized in the oxic lake water to form Fe- and Mn-rich layers. Iron is accumulated in the central parts of basins, whereas Mn is accumulated in relatively peripheral areas. The horizontal separation of these elements in the sediment is attributed to the difference in oxidation rate. Manganese content in pore water increases with depth at a site of Mn accumulation. This indicates that Mn is mobilized and deposited forming Mn concentrated layer just above Fe concentrated layer. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopic examination revealed that Fe was in the form of ferric oxyhydroxide, and that Fe and Mn were concentrated on the surface of sediment particles. Annual depositional rates of Fe and Mn correspond approximately to the reported rates of supply from lake-bottom springs. Therefore Fe and Mn contents in the sediment indicate the variations in hot spring activity at the lake bottom. This activity has fluctuated in intensity over the last 700 years, but now appears to be diminishing.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1994	28	3					289	306		10.2343/geochemj.28.289	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.28.289													WOS:A1994PL10400011

A newly investigated cupola spring-fed fen (Pawow site), located in the Lublin chalkland, eastern Poland, was the object of our study. This special karst region is characterised by the occurrence of Upper Cretaceous carbonate rocks in the substratum. Sedimentological observations indicated strong variability of biogenic-carbonate series in the deposits (=peat-tufa rhythmite), reflects changes of accumulation conditions (oxidising versus reducing), resulting from alternate occurrence of warmer and cooler periods. Difficulties in pollen analysis due to oxidising conditions necessitate a multidisciplinary approach for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. We used a multidisciplinary approach (sedimentological, palaeobotanical, geochemical analyses and radiocarbon dating) to determine the main evolutionary stages of this unique fen ecosystem and to discuss the role of local or/and regional factors in its development. Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses, supported by radiocarbon dating, proved that the bottom part of the cores represents the Late Glacial-Early Holocene stages of the fen development. A comparative analysis of palaeoenvironmental data showed close resemblance between the Pawow fen and the earlier studied fens in eastern Poland and Central-Eastern Europe, and the connection between their development and supraregional hydrological-climatic factors. The results indicated also the influence of the morphological position of such a type of ecosystem on the development of a continuous deposit succession. The occurrence of a river valley in close proximity of the Pawow site resulted in the lack of tufa deposits from the Atlantic period, because of an erosional phase in the river valley.

A delta O-18 sugar biomarker record was established by applying novel compound-specific delta O-18 analysis of plant sugar biomarkers (Zech and Glaser in Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom 23:3522-3532, 2009). This method overcomes analytical challenges such as extraction and purification faced by previous methods aimed at using delta O-18 of aquatic cellulose as a paleoclimate proxy. The delta O-18 results for sugar biomarkers arabinose, xylose and fucose agree well and reveal a pronounced trend towards lower delta O-18 values during the deglaciation and the onset of the Bolling/Allerod interstadial. By contrast, the period of the Younger Dryas is characterized by higher delta O-18 values. The early Holocene again reveals lower delta O-18 values. We suggest that our lacustrine delta O-18 record reflects coupled hydrological and thermal control. It is strongly related to changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-precipitation and resembles the delta O-18 records of Asian speleothems. With respect to the 'amount effect,' the record is interpreted as reflecting the Indian Summer Monsoon intensity. The precipitation signal is, however, amplified in our record by evaporative O-18 enrichment that is controlled by the ratio of precipitation to evaporation. We suggest that our delta O-18 record reflects the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon, which was strong during the Bolling/Allerod interstadial and early Holocene, but weak during the Younger Dryas stadial. This interpretation is corroborated by a pollen-based index for Lake Panch Pokhari that estimated the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon versus the strength of the Westerlies. Millennial-scale synchronicity with the Greenland delta O-18 temperature records highlights the previously suggested strong teleconnections between the Asian Monsoon system and North Atlantic climate variability.

Observed and Projected Climate Change in the Churchill Region of the Hudson Bay Lowlands and Implications for Pond Sustainability	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												There is concern over the fate of surface water bodies at high latitudes as a consequence of rising global temperatures. The goal of this study is to characterize climatic change that has occurred in the northern Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, from 1943 to 2009, to determine if this has resulted in a change to pond surface areas and to predict if changes may continue in the future. Climate change and changes to pond volume and size over the past similar to 60 years were examined using a combination of field methods/instrumental records (1943-2009), modeling (1953-2009; 1961-2100), and remote sensing/imagery analyses (1947-2008). Results demonstrate that temperatures are warming and breakup dates are earlier, but this has not significantly increased the duration of the open-water period or pond evaporation rates, which can be highly variable from year to year. Annual precipitation, primarily summer rainfall, has increased, lessening the summer moisture deficit and leading to wetter conditions. The observed changes of a smaller summer moisture deficit are predicted to continue in future, although there is less certainty with predictions of future precipitation than there is with predictions of air temperature. Thus, ponds are likely not at risk for drying and instead may be at risk for expansion. Despite the increases in summer rainfall, imagery analysis of 100 ponds shows that pond surface areas have fluctuated over the study period but have not increased in size.

Closed-basin lakes on the south-central Tibetan Plateau record the balance between monsoonal precipitation and evaporative loss. To date, most studies provide only qualitative estimates of past hydrological changes. For the first time, we applied hydrogen isotopes (delta D) of aquatic and terrestrial n-alkanes to quantify lake volume changes of Tangra Yumco and compared values to newly calculated lake volumes of Nam Co. We also used carbon isotopes of sedimentary n-alkanes to reveal past climate and environmental conditions around the lake. The water volume of Tangra Yumco changed by 146 km(3) in the past 17.42 cal ka. Lake volume increased in two steps, the first mainly initiated by glacial meltwater input after 16 cal ka BP, and to a minor extent by first strengthening of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). The second increase was caused by intensified summer monsoon precipitation at 11.45 cal ka BP. After 8.0 cal ka BP, lake volume decreased because of arid conditions, until an increase at 0.8 cal ka BP that was probably linked to a wet spell during the Little Ice Age. The lake level changes of Tangra Yumco and Nam Co were affected simultaneously by the ASM, although their amplitudes differed because of different local conditions, such as basin morphology or the blocking effect of neighboring mountains, which influences the rainout of air masses and wind-induced evaporation.

J	Mutz, SG; Aschauer, J				Mutz, Sebastian G.; Aschauer, Johannes			Empirical glacier mass-balance models for South America	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We investigate relationships between synoptic-scale atmospheric variability and the mass-balance of 13 Andean glaciers (located 16-55 degrees S) using Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) and multiple regressions. We then train empirical glacier mass-balance models (EGMs) in a cross-validated multiple regression procedure for each glacier. We find four distinct glaciological zones with regard to their climatic controls: (1) The mass-balance of the Outer Tropics glaciers is linked to temperature and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (PCC <= 0.6), (2) glaciers of the Desert Andes are mainly controlled by zonal wind intensity (PCC <= 0.9) and the Antarctic Oscillation (PCC <= 0.6), (3) the mass-balance of the Central Andes glaciers is primarily correlated with precipitation anomalies (PCC <= 0.8), and (4) the glacier of the Fuegian Andes is controlled by winter precipitation (PCC approximate to 0.7) and summer temperature (PCC approximate to -0.9). Mass-balance data in the Lakes District and Patagonian Andes zones, where most glaciers are located, are too sparse for a robust detection of synoptic-scale climatic controls. The EGMs yield R-2 values of similar to 0.45 on average and <= 0.74 for the glaciers of the Desert Andes. The EGMs presented here do not consider glacier dynamics or geometry and are therefore only suitable for short-term predictions.

Assessing the utility of dissolved organic matter photoreactivity as a predictor of in situ methylmercury concentration	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulation is a growing concern in ecosystems worldwide. The absorption of solar radiation by dissolved organic matter (DOM) and other photoreactive ligands can convert MeHg into less toxic forms of mercury through photodemethylation. In this study, spectral changes and photoreactivity of DOM were measured to assess the potential to control photoreactions and predict in situ MeHg concentration. Water samples collected from a series of lakes in southwestern Nova Scotia in June, August, and September were exposed to controlled ultraviolet-A (UV-A) radiation for up to 24 hr. Dissolved organic matter photoreactivity, measured as the loss of absorbance at 350 nm at constant UV-A irradiation, was positively dependent on the initial DOM concentration in lake waters (r(2) = 0.94). This relationship was consistent over time with both DOM concentration and photoreactivity increasing from summer into fall across lakes. Lake in situ MeHg concentration was positively correlated with DOM concentration and likely catchment transport in June (r = 0.77) but not the other sampling months. Despite a consistent seasonal variation in both DOM and Fe, and their respective correlations with MeHg, no discernable seasonal trend in MeHg was observed. However, a 3-year dataset from the 6 study lakes revealed a positive correlation between DOM concentration and both Fe (r = 0.91) and MeHg concentrations (r = 0.51) suggesting a more dominant landscape mobility control on MeHg. The DOM-MeHg relationships observed in these lakes highlights the need to examine DOM photoreactivity controls on MeHg transport and availability in natural waters particularly given future climate perturbations.

Addressing a critical knowledge gap in this region, our study presents the first comprehensive assessment of FMMEs in Moroccan aquatic ecosystems, including freshwater systems and estuaries, based on meticulous monitoring from January 2020 to December 2022. During this three-year period, we documented 18 FMMEs across 16 distinct ecosystems, with a notable increase in frequency observed during the summer and autumn months. Estuaries emerged as critical hotspots for these events, exhibiting the highest frequency of FMMEs and highlighting their vulnerability to climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Our findings indicate a staggering loss of at least 7.8 million fish, with Atherina boyeri, accounted and identified as the most affected species by FMMEs. The families Cyprinidae and Mugilidae experienced the most substantial impacts, including significant biomass losses in Chelon saliens, Chelon labrosus, and Cyprinus carpio. Additionally, endemic species such as Luciobarbus maghrebensis and Luciobarbus rabatensis also faced considerable declines. These events underscore severe ecological disruptions and provide novel insights into species distribution and interactions, including the first recorded presence of Oreochromis niloticus in previously undocumented regions. This research underscores the urgent need for targeted conservation strategies and proactive interventions to mitigate the ecological and socioeconomic ramifications of FMMEs. By addressing these critical issues, we can better protect Moroccan freshwater ecosystems that are at risk of further biodiversity loss.

J	Jia, WH; Liu, XQ				Jia, Weihan; Liu, Xingqi			Decadal- to centennial-scale climate changes over the last 2000 yr recorded from varved sediments of Lake Kusai, northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												High-resolution climate archives of the Late Holocene are essential in the study of paleoclimatic dynamics and for understanding the importance of natural and anthropogenic influences on past and future climate changes. Here, we present well-dated X-ray fluorescence scanning records retrieved from a varved sediment core from Lake Kusai. These records show the decadal- to centennial-scale paleoclimatic variability of the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over the last 2000 yr. Ca is mainly related to the precipitation of authigenic carbonates and is a proxy for temperature changes. The Ca record of Lake Kusai is well-correlated with the variations and periodicities of solar activity. Therefore, solar output can be suggested as being the predominant forcing mechanism of decadal- to centennial-scale temperature fluctuations over the last 2000 yr. The evolution of effective moisture was inferred from the log-ratios of Rb/Sr, which demonstrated synchronous changes with the typical Indian summer monsoon record from Dongge Cave. These results indicate that the decadal- to centennial-scale effective moisture evolution of the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is mainly influenced by the Indian summer monsoon. Additionally, we have not found the evident periodicities of solar activity in our effective moisture record over the last 2000 yr.

J	Vachula, RS; Chipman, ML; Hu, FS				Vachula, Richard S.; Chipman, Melissa L.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Holocene climatic change in the Alaskan Arctic as inferred from oxygen-isotope and lake-sediment analyses at Wahoo Lake	HOLOCENE												Despite recent progress in understanding high-latitude climate variability, paleoclimate records are scarce from the Alaskan Arctic. We conducted isotopic and sediment analyses at Wahoo Lake to infer Holocene climate variability in northeastern Alaska. Water O-18 and D values from the lake and its inlet/outlet streams suggest that winter precipitation dominates modern water inputs and that evaporation has limited influence on the lake's hydrological budget. The isotopic composition of Pisidium exhibits marked variations during the past 11,500 years, with O-18 ranging between -18.7 parts per thousand and -16.2 parts per thousand and C-13 between -7.1 parts per thousand and -2.3 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)). Elevated O-18 and sediment composition from 11.5 to 8.9 kcal. BP suggest evaporative O-18 enrichment and arid conditions. Rising lake levels are evidenced by the disappearance of Pisidium and a transition to low-carbonate gyttja ca. 6.3 kcal. BP and by the onset of sediment deposition on an adjacent shelf by 5.3 kcal. BP. These changes coincided with enhanced effective moisture in interior and southern Alaska as inferred from lake-level records and may be related to broad-scale atmospheric circulation changes. In the shelf sediments, carbonate abundance increases markedly at 3.5 kcal. BP, and O-18 increases from -18.0 parts per thousand to -16.5 parts per thousand at 2.1 kcal. BP, possibly resulting from increased temperature and/or summer precipitation. After 2.1 kcal. BP, O-18 fluctuates with an overall decreasing trend to -17.2 parts per thousand at 0.9 kcal. BP. Late-Holocene variations in our O-18 record display coherent patterns with regional glacier fluctuations at centennial to millennial scales, suggesting that O-18 minima were related to a combination of low temperatures and enhanced winter snowfall. Holocene variations in organic matter abundance at Wahoo Lake also show broad similarities to total solar irradiance, implying that suborbital solar variability played a role in modulating regional climate and aquatic productivity.

The data used to create the maps were consistent with those reported by the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory. The coasts of Washington and Oregon and the areas around the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes generally have high outdoor EMC; while Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, and some parts of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California are generally dry. Some localities such as Fresno, California show a wide variation in monthly outdoor EMC while others such as Colorado Springs, Colorado have almost constant EMC throughout the year. To generate the indoor EMC maps, it was assumed that the outdoor air is heated sensibly to an indoor temperature of 68degreesF (20degreesC). Sensible heating decreased indoor EMC especially during the winter months, with the colder northern regions of the country showing the most dramatic reduction in EMC. Just like outdoor EMC, the indoor EMC in southeastern states around the Gulf of Mexico was high throughout the year. Although the areas surrounding the Great Lakes have high outdoor EMC, their average indoor EMC was low and exhibited more monthly variation. States with low outdoor EMC like Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada also have low indoor EMC.																			0015-7473					DEC	2004	54	12					122	125																WOS:000226020000019

Constraining invader dominance: Effects of repeated herbicidal management and environmental factors on curlyleaf pondweed dynamics in 50 Minnesota lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) is one of the most widespread and widely managed aquatic invasive plants in North America. Despite decades of management, the efficacy of long-term management strategies and the effects of environmental drivers on curlyleaf pondweed populations remain uncertain. To evaluate the effects of management and environmental factors on within-lake distribution and local density of curlyleaf pondweed, we collated monitoring data from point-intercept surveys collected by a variety of lake managers across Minnesota, U.S.A. Using this dataset, comprising 177 lake-years of plant data, we examined the influence of herbicide treatment, water clarity, snow depth, and ice cover duration on curlyleaf pondweed distribution and density between 2006 and 2015. We evaluated the effects of herbicides on curlyleaf pondweed at three time points relative to treatment: within year, carryover effects the following year, and cumulative effects over multiple years of treatment. All three temporal measures were associated with significant reductions of curlyleaf pondweed. Additionally, herbicidal management reduced both the density and distribution of curlyleaf pondweed. Given that herbicide management led to reductions that carried over into future years, managers may be able to design multi-year treatments to reduce total management effort over time. We also found strong effects of environmental conditions on curlyleaf pondweed. Elevated lake productivity and decreased winter snow cover were associated with increased springtime distributions of curlyleaf pondweed, whereas duration of winter ice cover had no influence. The influence of productivity suggests that reductions of this invasive species may be an ancillary benefit of water-quality improvements that lower lakes' trophic status. Our results also show that decreased winter snow cover, as predicted under climate change, could exacerbate problematic growth of curlyleaf pondweed. Harnessing monitoring data from multiple projects, as this study does, allows for robust inference about environmental and management constraints on macrophytes. Because of environmental and management variability, we suggest that treatment regimens follow an adaptive management cycle, with outcomes of management monitored and evaluated, and strategies updated accordingly. It is also vital to continue monitoring both managed and unmanaged lakes to enable stronger inferences about treatment effectiveness.					; Newman, Raymond/AAD-8343-2019; Larkin, Daniel/IVV-7477-2023	Larkin, Daniel/0000-0001-6378-0495; Newman, Raymond/0000-0002-1170-3217; Verhoeven, Michael/0000-0002-6340-9490; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2020	65	5					849	862		10.1111/fwb.13468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13468		JAN 2020											WOS:000505482200001

From 2019 to 2023, the average spring number of Ruppia shoots gradually increased exponentially. From 2019 to 2023, there was a gradual decrease in the average spring abundance of zooplankton within the Ruppia meadows. A significant positive relationship was noted between the Gammarus aequicauda abundance and the number of Ruppia shoots in all years, but there was a negative relationship for Moina salina and Cletocamptus retrogressus with Ruppia.Conclusions This study presents the largely neglected effect of seagrass on zooplankton in small hypersaline water bodies.Implications This information is valuable for the management of hypersaline water bodies and the development of sustainable polyaquaculture in them.

Gschliefgraben mudslide (Austria): hazard evaluation and risk mitigation	NATURAL HAZARDS												A rock slide on top of the clayey-silty-sandy-pebbly masses in the Gschliefgraben (Upper Austria province, Lake Traunsee) having occurred in 2006, together with the humid autumn of 2007, triggered a mudslide comprising a volume up to 4 million mA(3) and moving with a maximum displacement velocity of 5 m/day during the winter of 2007-2008. The possible damage was estimated up to 60 million a,not sign due to the possible destruction of houses and of a road to a settlement with intense tourism. The movement front ran ahead in the creek bed. Therefore, it was assumed that water played an important role. Inclinometer measurements showed that a less permeable layer was sliding on a thin, more permeable layer. During the last centuries, mudslides had already pushed farms into the lake, as reported by chronicles. Thus, the inhabitants of 46 houses had to be evacuated for safety reasons. They could return to their homes after displacement velocities had decreased. It was decided (a) to prevent soaking of water into the uppermost, less permeable layer by transversal drainages, (b) to lower the pore water pressures by longitudinal trenches filled with blocky material, (c) to pump water out of the more permeable layer by well drillings upslope of the houses in order to create a stable block below the houses and (d) to remove material thrust over the stable blocks in order to avoid damage to the houses. These mitigation measures costing 11.5 million a,not sign led to a deceleration of the process to displacement velocities of some cm/year up to now. The houses and the road were not damaged.

To date, data on plastic and microplastic occurrence in pristine ecosystems like high-mountain lakes are lacking. In this study, plastic (>5000 mu m) and microplastic (10-5000 mu m) levels were measured in snow at the end of the winter season (April 2020), and in water, sediment, and biological samples collected monthly (June-October 2019) during the ice-free season from the Dimon Lake, a high-mountain lake in the Carnic Alps, northeast Italy. Biological samples consisted of chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae; n = 150) and stomach contents of Cottus gobio (n = 40). Analysis of the water, sediment, and biological samples revealed the absence of plastic and microplastics larger than 10 mu m, whereas the snow samples contained microplastics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) albeit at very low levels (0.11 +/- 0.19 L-1). These results show that while the lake ecosystem could be considered unpolluted by microplastics, abundant snow precipitation in winter can trap microplastic particles that deposit on the ground. The very low levels of PET microparticles recorded in the snow samples suggest the need for further research to better understand the source of microplastic pollution in this environmental matrix.

J	Chang, YH; Wang, HW; Hou, WS				Chang, Yuan-Hsiou; Wang, Hsiao-Wen; Hou, Wen-Shang			Effects of construction materials and design of lake and stream banks on climbing ability of frogs and salamanders	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												With the increasing development of many areas in recent years, concrete structures are often installed along water bodies in order to protect the safety of local residents. However, effects of these concrete structures on environments and mobility of amphibian species are still unknown. The construction of concrete banks along rivers associated with human development has become a serious problem in Taiwan. Most ecosystems used by amphibians are lakes and stream banks, yet no related design solutions to accommodate the needs of amphibians have been used in Taiwan. In this research, we selected eight species of amphibians and investigated their climbing abilities in an effort to improve lake and river bank designs. We evaluated their climbing abilities on five angles of bank slopes, identified relationships between an amphibian's climbing ability and different surface substrates of banks, i.e. Japanese silvergrass (Miscanthus floridulus) mixed with moss, cobblestone, wood (Philippine mahogany), clay, and concrete, under high humidity and different temperatures to simulate changes across the four seasons. The results showed that climbing ability of these amphibians is slightly decreased at low temperatures. For example, on a 450 slope in winter, the average climbing ability decreased 8% from results in summer. The upper limit of bank design slope suitable for Hynobius arisanensis on rock and wood surfaces is 45 degrees. For amphibians from alpine areas in Taiwan, such as Bufo bankorensis, the maximum suitable slope is 15 degrees. With concrete as the water bank material, slopes <30 degrees are preferable. The results presented here can serve as a reference for technicians involved in future ecological engineering designs of banks throughout the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lagged cumulative spruce budworm defoliation affects the risk of fire ignition in Ontario, Canada	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Detailed understanding of forest disturbance interactions is needed for effective forecasting, modelling, and management. Insect outbreaks are a significant forest disturbance that alters forest structure as well as the distribution and connectivity of combustible fuels at broad spatial scales. The effect of insect outbreaks on fire activity is an important but contentious issue with significant policy consequences. The eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is a native defoliating insect in eastern North America whose periodic outbreaks create large patches of dead fir and spruce trees. Of particular concern to fire and forest managers is whether these patches represent an increased fire risk, if so, for how long, and how the relationship between defoliation and fire risk varies through space and time. Previous work suggests a temporary increase in flammability in budworm-killed forests, but regional and seasonal variability in these relationships has not been examined. Using an extensive database on historical lightning-caused fire ignitions and spruce budworm defoliation between 1963 and 2000, we assess the relative importance of cumulative defoliation and fire weather on the probability of ignition in Ontario, Canada. We modeled fire ignition using a generalized additive logistic regression model that accounts for temporal autocorrelation in fire weather. We compared two ecoregions in eastern Ontario (Abitibi Plains) and western Ontario (Lake of the Woods) that differ in terms of climate, geomorphology, and forest composition. We found that defoliation has the potential to both increase and decrease the probability of ignition depending on the time scale, ecoregion, and season examined. Most importantly, we found that lagged spruce budworm defoliation (8-10yr) increases the risk of fire ignition whereas recent defoliation (1yr) can decrease this risk. We also found that historical defoliation has a greater influence on ignition risk during the spring than during the summer fire season. Given predicted increases in forest insect activity due to global change, these results represent important information for fire management agencies that can be used to refine existing models of fire risk.																			1051-0761	1939-5582					2017	27	2					532	544		10.1002/eap.1463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.1463								27809401					WOS:000395634300017

Yet, little is currently known about the diversity of benthic copepods in lentic habitats. We gathered information on the benthic copepod assemblages of the littoral zone of Lake Maggiore as part of the Interreg Italy-Switzerland 2014-2020 Parchi Verbano Ticino project (ID: 481668), funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Lake Maggiore is a large and deep temperate lake in north-western Italy human-managed from mid-March to mid-September. This contributes to substantial changes in water levels in relation to human activities such as hydropower, industrial and agricultural uses. We compiled a dataset listing 234 occurrences of benthic copepod species recorded from three littoral sampling sites situated in three protected areas, two of which are part of the Natura 2000 network in Italy and one is part of the Emerald Network in Switzerland. We collected the specimens during the summer-autumn period in 2019-2021. We identified the copepods to the species level level and created a dataset with individual georeferenced occurrence records for each species, organized in a standardized Darwin Core Archive format. We made available, through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a total of 13 distinct taxonomic entities and 234 unique georeferenced occurrence records related to the benthic copepod assemblages of the littoral zone of Lake Maggiore. The dataset has the potential to support the authorities in charge of managing Lake Maggiore's water levels in addressing the ecological risk relevant to the littoral zone and in developing shared implementation strategies for sustainable water management.

J	Striegl, RG; Michmerhuizen, CM				Striegl, RG; Michmerhuizen, CM			Hydrologic influence on methane and carbon dioxide dynamics at two north-central Minnesota lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Annual emissions of (CH4 + CO2) to the atmosphere were proportional to net hydrologic inputs of C, mostly by groundwater, at two lakes in the Shingobee River watershed in north-central Minnesota. Williams Lake (WL), a closed basin lake near the top of the watershed, had a hydraulic residence time of 2-4 yr and groundwater exchange of about +2 mol dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and -0.1 mol dissolved organic carbon (DOC) m(-2) lake area yr(-1). The Shingobee River flows through Shingobee Lake (SL) that had a hydraulic residence of 0.3-0.4 yr and received net groundwater plus surface-water inputs of +5.3 to +7.3 mol DIC and fewer than +1.3 mol (DOC + particulate organic carbon) m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 60-80% of net annual C input to SL was from groundwater. Lake storage of CH4 and CO2 was greatest in late winter, with maximum emissions to the atmosphere immediately following ice melt. The lakes emitted CH4 continuously during open water, having annual losses of -1.6 mol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) at WL and -1.9 mol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) at SL. Although the WL epilimnion was CO2 depleted throughout summer, net annual CO2 exchange with the atmosphere was near zero because springtime emission offset summertime uptake. CO2 supersaturation resulted in emission of -8.0 mol CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) at SL.																			0024-3590					NOV	1998	43	7					1519	1529		10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1519	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1519													WOS:000077285000012

Traditional foods and 25(OH) D concentrations in a subarctic First Nations community	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH												Background. Sub-optimal vitamin D status is common worldwide and the condition may be associated with increased risk for various chronic diseases. In particular, low vitamin D status is highly prevalent in indigenous communities in Canada, although limited data are available on the determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) concentrations in this population. The relationship between traditional food consumption and vitamin D status has not been well documented. Objective. To investigate the determinants of serum 25(OH) D status in a First Nations community in Ontario, Canada, with a focus on the role of traditional food consumption and activities. Methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted within the Sandy Lake Health and Diabetes Project (2003-2005). A total of 445 participants (> 12 years of age) were assessed for serum 25(OH) D status, anthropometric and lifestyle variables, including traditional and non-traditional dietary practices and activities. Diet patterns were identified using factor analysis, and multivariate linear regression analysis was used to analyse the determinants of 25(OH) D concentrations. Results. Mean serum 25(OH) D concentrations were 22.1 nmol/L (16.9, 29.9 nmol/L) in men and 20.5 nmol/L (16.0, 27.3 nmol/L) in women. Multivariate determinants of higher serum 25(OH) D included higher consumption of traditional and healthier market foods, higher wild fish consumption, male gender, spring/summer season of blood collection and more frequent physical activity. Significant negative determinants included hours of TV/day, higher BMI and higher consumption of unhealthy market foods. Conclusions. Traditional food consumption contributed independently to higher 25(OH) D concentrations in a First Nations community with a high prevalence of sub-optimal vitamin D status.

J	Bertone, E; Stewart, RA; Zhang, H; O'Halloran, K				Bertone, Edoardo; Stewart, Rodney A.; Zhang, Hong; O'Halloran, Kelvin			Analysis of the mixing processes in the subtropical Advancetown Lake, Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper presents an extensive investigation of the mixing processes occurring in the subtropical monomictic Advancetown Lake, which is the main water body supplying the Gold Coast City in Australia. Meteorological, chemical and physical data were collected from weather stations, laboratory analysis of grab samples and an in-situ Vertical Profiling System (VPS), for the period 2008-2012. This comprehensive, high frequency dataset was utilised to develop a one-dimensional model of the vertical transport and mixing processes occurring along the water column. Multivariate analysis revealed that air temperature and rain forecasts enabled a reliable prediction of the strength of the lake stratification. Vertical diffusion is the main process driving vertical mixing, particularly during winter circulation. However, a high reservoir volume and warm winters can limit the degree of winter mixing, causing only partial circulation to occur, as was the case in 2013. This research study provides a comprehensive approach for understanding and predicting mixing processes for similar lakes, whenever high-frequency data are available from VPS or other autonomous water monitoring systems.

Freshwater polychaetes (Manayunkia speciosa) near the Detroit River, western Lake Erie: Abundance and life-history characteristics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Freshwater polychaetes are relatively rare and little-studied members of the benthos of lakes and rivers. We studied one polychaete species (Manayunkia speciosa) in Lake Erie near the mouth of the Detroit River. Abundances at one site were determined between 1961 and 2013 and life-history characteristics at two sites were determined seasonally (March-November) in 2009-2010 and 2012-2013. Life-history characteristics included abundances, length-frequency distributions, presence/absence of constructed tubes, sexual maturity, and number and maturation of young-of-the-year (YOY) in tubes. Long-term abundances decreased in successive time periods between 1961 and 2003 (mean range = 57,570 to 2583/m(2)) but few changes occurred between 2003 and 2013 (mean = 5007/m(2); range/y = 2355-8216/m(2)). Seasonal abundances varied substantially between sites and years, but overall, abundances were low in March-April, high in May-August, and low in September-November. Although reproduction was continuous throughout warmer months, en masse recruitment, as revealed by length-frequency distributions, occurred in a brief period late June to mid July, and possibly in early-September. All life-history characteristics, including tube construction, were dependent on water temperatures (>5 degrees C in spring and <15 degrees C in fall). These results generally agree with and complement laboratory studies of M. speciosa in the Pacific Northwest where M. speciosa hosts parasites that cause substantial fish mortalities. Although abundance of M. speciosa near the mouth of the Detroit River was 33-fold lower in 2013 than it was in 1961, this population has persisted for five decades and, therefore, has the potential to harbor parasites that may cause fish mortalities in the Great Lakes.

However, the parameterization of these variables and simulation of their interactions in large shallow lakes have not been strictly evaluated owing to a lack of field observations of lake hydrodynamic processes. To address this problem, two process-based field observations were conducted to record the development of summer and winter wind-driven currents in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China. Using these observations and numerical experiments, a Wave and Current Coupled Model (WCCM) is developed by rebuilding the wind drag coefficient expression, introducing wave-induced radiation stress, and adopting a simple turbulence scheme to simulate wind-driven currents in Lake Taihu. The results show that the WCCM can accurately simulate the upwelling process driven by wind-driven currents during the field observations. A comparison with a reference model indicates a 42.9 % increase of the WCCM-simulated current speed, which is mainly attributed to the new wind drag coefficient expression. The WCCM-simulated current direction and field are also improved owing to the introduction of wave-induced radiation stress. The use of the simple turbulent scheme in the WCCM improves the efficiency of the upwelling process simulation. The WCCM thus provides a sound basis for simulating shallow lake ecosystems.

J	LOCKE, WW				LOCKE, WW			LATE PLEISTOCENE GLACIERS AND THE CLIMATE OF WESTERN MONTANA, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Western Montana is ideally situated to have both its climate affected by the presence of Pleistocene ice sheets and those effects be apparent in its distribution of mountain glaciers. Paleoequilibrium line altitudes (paleoELAs) determined through a weighted average of cirque floor elevations, highest lateral moraines, and interpreted glacial extents define a complex pattern which reflects sources of moisture, directions of airflow, and sites of local convergence and divergence of air masses. The regional trend of paleoELAs is parallel to that of present glacier ELAs but lies about 450 m lower. The parallelism suggests that the reginal controls on moisture availability during late Pleistocene time were similar to those at present. Numerical reconstructions of precipitation required to maintain glaciers assuming a uniform regional 10.degree. C summer temperature depression indicate a Pleistocene decrease in precipitation, relative to present, of about 25 cm H2O. Decreases were greater (more than 50 cm H2O) over the high mountains of southwest Montana and snowfall may have increased (by more than 50 cm H2O) in west-central Montana. Glacial Lakes Missoula and Great Falls may have served as significant local moisture sources during periods of maximum glaciation. Windflow patterns were similar to those at present, except that convergence of prevailing westerlies and katabatic winds from the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets apparently generated local forceful uplift and increased precipitation.																			0004-0851					FEB	1990	22	1					1	13		10.2307/1551716	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551716													WOS:A1990CQ32100001

Despite this little is known about the invertebrate fauna of freshwater habitats and environmental factors that structure these in blanket bogs, particularly in small upland lakes. This study addressed this topic by sampling twelve small lakes ( < 0.21km(2)) at altitudes greater than 300 meters above sea level. Macroinvertebrates were sampled by standard kick-sweeps (five per lake) and Chironomidae were sampled by collecting foam samples, both in spring and late summer in 2005. A total of 202 taxa were identified, largely dominated by the insect orders Diptera, Trichoptera, Heteroptera and Coleoptera. Some were notable as either rare, new records for an area or typical of either upland or acidic water conditions. The chironomids alone contributed 100 species, five of which were confirmed new Irish records, one had not been recorded in the UK at the time of sampling. There were significant differences in both the macroinvertebrate and chironomid assemblages recorded in the twelve lakes. About 78% of the variation was attributed to differences in pH, elevation and nutrients (total phosphorus, nitrates and/or ammonia). Species turnover between the two seasons sampled was high for chironomids but low for the rest of the macroinvertebrates. Significant seasonal changes in the macroinvertebrate community composition occurred, particularly in lakes with a pH of less than 6. Lakes situated on either igneous or sedimentary geologies grouped together, indicating that the surrounding peaty soils usually had a greater influence on water chemistry Small lakes in upland blanket bog have characteristic invertebrate communities, in part, similar to other aquatic peatland habitats. More such studies are required to document the species present and to determine how susceptible these lakes are to anthropogenic impacts such as climate change.

Carbonate lakes may act as both sources and sinks of CO 2 depending on the interactions between the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) inputs, lake metabolisms, and geochemical processes. It is often difficult to distinguish the dominant mechanisms driving CO 2 dynamics and their effects on CO 2 emissions. This study was undertaken in three groundwater -fed carbonate -rich lakes in central Spain (Ruidera Lakes), severely polluted with nitrates from agricultural overfertilization. Diel and seasonal (summer and winter) changes in CO 2 concentration (C CO2 ) DIC, and CO 2 emissions-(F CO2 )-, as well as physical and chemical variables, including primary production and phytoplanktonic chlorophyll - a were measured. In addition, 8 13 C-DIC, 8 13 C-CO 2 in lake waters, and 8 13 C of the sedimentary organic matter were measured seasonally to identify the primary CO 2 sources and processes. While the lakes were consistently C CO2 supersaturated and F CO2 was released to the atmosphere during both seasons, the highest C CO2 and DIC were in summer (0.36-2.26 mu mol L -1 ). Our results support a strong phosphorus limitation for primary production in these lakes, which impinges on CO 2 dynamics. External DIC inputs to the lake waters primarily drive the C CO2 and, therefore, the F CO2 . The 8 13 C-DIC signatures below -12 %o confirmed the primary geogenic influence on DIC. As also suggested by the high values on the calcite saturation index, the Miller -Tans plot revealed that the CO 2 source in the lakes was close to the signature provided by the fractionation of 8 13 C-CO 2 from calcite precipitation. Therefore, the main contribution behind the C CO2 values found in these karst lakes should be attributed to the calcite precipitation process, which is temperature -dependent according to the seasonal change observed in 8 13 C-DIC values. Finally, co -precipitation of phosphate with calcite could partly explain the observed low phytoplankton production in these lakes and the impact on the contribution to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. However, as eutrophication increases and the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) content increases, the co -precipitation of phosphate is expected to be progressively inhibited. These thresholds must be assessed to understand how the CO 3 2 - ions drive lake co -precipitation dynamics. Carbonate regions extend over 15% of the Earth's surface but seem essential in the CO 2 dynamics at a global scale.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Puche, Eric/ABF-2177-2020	Vargas-Sanchez, Mariana/0000-0002-4681-2755; 													2167-8359					MAY 22	2024	12								E17393	10.7717/peerj.17393	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.17393								38799067					WOS:001231117200001

Summer circulation and exchange in the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We use a three-dimensional, unstructured grid hydrodynamic model to examine circulation and exchange in the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system during the summer months for three consecutive years (2009-2011). The model was tested against ADCP observations of currents, data from a Lagrangian drifter experiment in the Saginaw Bay, and temperature data from the National Data Buoy Center stations. Mean circulation was predominantly cyclonic in the main basin of Lake Huron with current speeds in the surface layer being highest in August. Circulation in the Saginaw Bay was characterized by the presence of an anticyclonic gyre at the mouth of the outer bay and two recirculating cells within the inner bay. New estimates are provided for the mean flushing times (computed as the volume of the bay divided by the rate of inflow) and residence times (computed as e-folding flushing times based on dye concentration modeling treating the bay as a continuously stirred tank reactor) for Saginaw Bay. The average flushing time (over the 3 months of summer and for all 3 years) was 23.0 days for the inner bay and 9.9 days for the entire bay. The mean e-folding flushing time was 62 days (2 months) for the inner bay and 115 days (3.7 months) for the entire bay for the summer conditions examined in this work. To characterize the behavior of river plumes in the inner Saginaw Bay, trajectory data from GPS-enabled Lagrangian drifters were used to compute the absolute diffusivity values in the alongshore and cross-shore directions.

To explore the controls and drivers of the Late Holocene (similar to 3350-2560 cal. yr. BP) vegetation succession and East Asian summer monsoon precipitation changes in the Central Plains of China, we conducted pollen analysis of the Pu Tian core collected from Zhengzhou, China. The results showed three periods of vegetation and East Asian summer monsoon variation: coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest between similar to 3350-3025 cal. yr. BP, increasing forest vegetation dominated by broadleaf Betula between similar to 3025-2930 cal. yr. BP, decreasing forest vegetation and increasing herbaceous plants dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae between similar to 2930-2560 cal. yr. BP. Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares Regression was used to quantitatively reconstruct the average annual precipitation variation in the Central Plains of China. Our precipitation reconstruction and its comparison to other reconstructions and forcing show that it was influenced by internal (intertropical convergence zone and El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation) and external (Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation) forcing. Specifically, average annual precipitation decreased significantly between similar to 2980-2680 cal. yr. BP, and tree pollen (such as Betula) also decreased significantly during this period, possibly related to the "2.8 ka" event (a weak monsoon event in the Holocene). Our comparison of the published climate and environmental records of the East Asian monsoon region suggests that the 2.8 ka event exhibiting a "W" structure of "dry-wet-dry" and may have been caused by the weakening of solar activity, which affected the climate of the East Asian monsoon region through oceanic and terrestrial atmospheric circulation such as El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2025	248								108589	10.1016/j.catena.2024.108589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2024.108589		NOV 2024											WOS:001371686400001

This study aimed to relate total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in fishes of an Amazonian lake (Catalao Lake) to their dietary changes during different hydrological seasons (rising-, high-, falling-, and low-water). Levels of THg, MeHg, and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (delta N-15 and delta C-13) were determined in the muscles of six fish species: Rhytiodus microlepis, Hemiodus sp., Triportheus albus, Anodus elongatus, Pellona flavipinnis and Acestrorhynchus falcirostris. Triportheusalbus, an omnivorous fish, showed a significant relationship between Hg concentrations and delta C-13 signatures (negative regression; THg: p = 0.0001 and MeHg: p = 0.0002), as well as between Hg and delta N-15 signatures (positive regression; THg: p = 0.003 and MeHg: p = 0.021), indicating that changes in feeding habits influenced the Hg concentrations in this species. The herbivorous R. microlepis presented the highest MeHg concentrations during the high-water season, reflecting Hg methylation in its diet (macrophyte roots) during flooded season. The piscivorous A. falcirostris had the lowest THg concentrations during this season because of lower prey availability. Slopes of the regressions between the Hg concentrations and delta N-15 values followed the sequence of rising-< high-< falling-water seasons (THg: 0.06 < 0.11 < 0.15; MeHg: 0.07 < 0.10 < 0.17), indicating that the difference between the THg and MeHg concentrations observed for lower-and higher-trophic-level fish increased during the falling-water season, resulting in trophic biomagnification. The present study shows that feeding habit and the flood-pulse influence mercury concentrations in the muscle of fishes from Catalao Lake.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) was introduced to Sweden in 1960, and it has a high commercial and recreational value, but it may also have negative effects on native ecosystems. To better predict how climate warming will affect population dynamics of this cool-water crayfish, we explored the role of temperature and density dependence as explanatory factors of the subsequent years' catch rates of commercially sized signal crayfish in four Swedish lakes. We found air temperatures to be good proxies for water temperatures in all lakes, except during winter. We could only obtain water temperature data for Lake Vattern, and winter temperature data were therefore only included in the analysis of catch-per-unit-effort patterns in this lake. Our results indicate that increasing mean air temperatures will potentially affect the population dynamics of cool-water freshwater crayfish species such as the signal crayfish. Based on data from four lakes, it seems that the population dynamics of signal crayfish are lake-specific and could be affected by either recruitment during the juvenile stage, the survival and growth of adults, or both. Increased fluctuations in water temperature during winter may potentially influence adult survival. To better predict the effects of global warming on the dynamics of cool-water crayfish populations, we suggest that future studies should investigate recruitment in crayfish along temperature gradients and the influence of variations in water temperature on winter mortality.					; Edsman, Lennart/MVV-6088-2025	Edsman, Lennart/0000-0002-2113-1937; Johansson, Jacob/0000-0002-0018-7018													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2016	73	5					785	792		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0241													WOS:000375425900006

Evaluation of quantitative real-time PCR to characterise spatial and temporal variations in cyanobacteria, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenaya et Subba Raju and cylindrospermopsin concentrations in three subtropical Australian reservoirs	HARMFUL ALGAE												Three drinking water storage reservoirs in subtropical southeast Queensland, Australia have regular blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii that can produce cylindrospermopsins. We tested water samples from 16 sites in 3 reservoirs on 2 sampling occasions during a bloom of C. raciborskii in the austral summer and autumn of 2007. Using a range of parameters including quantitative real-time PCR, microscope cell counts and HPLC-MS/MS we correlated the 16S ribosomal RNA gene with total cyanobacteria, the rpoC1 gene with C raciborskii cell concentrations, and the cyrC gene with cylindrospermopsin concentrations to assess spatial and temporal variability within and between reservoirs. While the correlation between cyrC and cylindrospermopsin cell quotas was good (mean r(2) = 0.61 for February samples and 0.75 for March samples), the correlation between total cyanobacteria and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and between C raciborskii and the rpoC1 gene were poor indicating that further work is needed to develop these novel molecular methods. Spatial and temporal analysis of the distribution of rpoC1, cylindrospermopsin cell quotas, and a range of physical and chemical water quality parameters showed the greatest variation occurred between reservoirs, and within the largest and most spatially diverse reservoir. This suggests that populations of C. raciborskii strains with inherently different cylindrospermopsin cell quotas may be an important driver of toxicity in these reservoirs. An outcome of this study was the observation that deoxycylindrospermopsin always exceeded the cylindrospermopsin cell quota by up to 5-fold, and that a peak cell quota of 60 fg (cylindrospermopsin + deoxycylindrospermopsin) cell(-1) was measured.

J	Xu, WZ; Collingsworth, PD; Minsker, B				Xu, Wenzhao; Collingsworth, Paris D.; Minsker, Barbara			Algorithmic Characterization of Lake Stratification and Deep Chlorophyll Layers From Depth Profiling Water Quality Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We develop and test algorithms for rapidly and consistently analyzing water quality profile data such as temperature and fluorescence that are used to identify lake thermostratification and deep chlorophyll layers (DCL). Currently, the processing of profile data and identification of key features are manual and subjective, and thus, the results are not comparable from one sampling event to another. In this study, we develop a method to approximate vertical temperature profiles with linear segments using a piecewise linear representation algorithm, from which stratification patterns can be extracted. We also propose an automated peak detection algorithm to identify the location and magnitude of DCL. The algorithms are applied to water quality profile data collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Great Lakes National Program Office, which conducts annual depth profiling using conductivity, temperature, depth profilers at fixed locations in the Great Lakes. The algorithms generate similar results to human judgments, with some outliers that show expert errors, algorithm limitations, and ambiguities in defining layers. We also show how the algorithms can analyze the shape of temperature and fluorescence profiles to detect unusual patterns. Lake Superior is used as a case study to reveal spatial and temporal trends of the thermocline, DCL, and the heat storage change from spring to summer. The results reveal that more heat was stored in the eastern basin of the lake. The methods proposed here will help take full advantage of historical depth profiling data and benefit future sampling processes by providing a consistent method.

Lakeside Phragmites australis reed beds were mown or burnt in winter as a countermeasure against the die-back of reeds in Lake Constance-Untersee. 2. The effect of winter harvesting and burning on the mechanical resistance of reeds against waves and washes was investigated using the PMR model. This model postulates that the percentage of mechanically damaged shoots of a reed stand is a monotonically declining function of the mean stem diameter, the relative thickness of the stem wall, the modulus of elasticity, and the shoot density per square metre. 3. Winter harvesting and burning influences the geometric (stem diameter, rel. wall thickness) and the mechanic properties (modulus of elasticity, breaking stress) of culms in each shoot class (primary shoots, secondary shoots, insect infested shoots). The management leads to a shift in stand structure from the dominance of stout primary shoots to the dominance of weaker and thinner secondary shoots. The total shoot density is increased. 4. Mown and burnt reeds exhibit thinner culms, on average, with lower moduli of elasticity at higher shoot densities. Their power of mechanical resistance (PMR) is substantially reduced in comparison to the untreated reference. According to this model it is assumed that mown or burnt stands lose significantly more culms and biomass by failing than untreated stands. 5. In Lake Constance-Untersee mechanical factors (waves + washes) are of great significance for the development of the lakeside reed border. In this regard, winter harvesting and burning cannot be recommended as a measure against reed decline.																			1146-609X						1995	16	3					277	294																WOS:A1995TJ37300002

Evaluating upstream passage and timing of approach by adult bigheaded carps at a gated dam on the Illinois River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dams are a conservation threat because they function as barriers to native fish movement; however, they may prevent the spread of invasive species. Invasive bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem and are advancing towards Lake Michigan via the Illinois River. Navigation dams on the Illinois River may deter bigheaded carps' upstream movement. We investigated the permeability of the Starved Rock Lock and Dam (SRLD), the most downstream gated Illinois River dam, to bigheaded carps' migration by examining the timing of individuals approaching and passing through SRLD in relation to gate openness, tailwater elevation, and water temperature. Using acoustic telemetry of (N=similar to 104 per year) tagged fish, 13 upstream passages of bigheaded carps occurred through SRLD between 2013 and 2016. Eleven passages occurred through the dam gates and 2 through the lock chamber, indicating deterrents (e.g., CO2) placed in SRLD lock chamber may only limit passage of a small proportion of all fish passing through the lock-and-dam structure. Passages were documented only in 2013 and 2015. Most of the dam gate passages occurred during high water when gates were completely out of the water. Timing of bigheaded carps approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising water temperature and high tailwater elevation, and all fish approached during late March through mid-September. Movement through dams is rare; modifying gate operations to reduce gate openness during late spring and summer could further reduce the permeability of gated dams such as SRLD to bigheaded carps, slowing their upstream advance.					; Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012; Garvey, James/A-4919-2012	Lubejko, Matthew/0000-0002-1627-9179; Oliver, Devon/0000-0001-5799-1528; Coulter, Alison/0000-0002-5604-6513; Garvey, James/0000-0001-5393-9351													1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2017	33	8					1268	1278		10.1002/rra.3180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3180													WOS:000412518100004

The Younger Dryas cold event at Le Locle was characterized by (i) a general trend toward a slight increase in summer temperature and a decrease in annual precipitation and (ii) a marked drying phase at ca. 11,900 cal yr B.P. that occurred between two wetter ones. Further phases of major deficit in moisture occured at ca. 11,500 cat yr B.P. (Younger Dryas-Holocene transition), 10,800 cat yr B.P., 8700 cat yr B.P., and 6500 cat yr B.P. Climatic parameters reconstructed here suggest that phases of higher lake level developing at ca. 12,500-12,000, 11,750-11,600, 11,200-10,900 (synchronous with the Preboreal oscillation), 10,400-8900, 8400-8300 (possibly related to the 8200 yr event), and 7800-7000 cat yr B.P. coincided with an increase in annual precipitation, a decrease in summer temperature, and a shorter growing season. Conversely, periods of low lake level corresponded to a decrease in annual precipitation, an increase in summer temperature, and a longer growing season. This general pattern could have resulted from alternate southward-northward displacements of the Atlantic Westerly Jet. (C) 2001 University of Washington.

Seasonal variations of water and sediment quality parameters in endorheic reed pans on the Mpumalanga Highveld	WATER SA												The Mpumalanga Lakes District consists of approximately 320 pans, of which less than 3% are classified as reed pans. There is limited information available on reed pans and as a result they are at risk of various anthropogenic activities, for example mining and agriculture. Four reed pans were selected and assessed to determine seasonal trends of a variety of water and sediment quality parameters. The study took place over one seasonal cycle from 2008-2009; samples were collected seasonally to account for various hydrological extremes. Water samples were collected and their nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations were determined, while various other water quality parameters were measured in situ. Sediment samples were analysed for physical and chemical properties, namely, grain size and organic carbon content. The seasonal changes in concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Sr, U and Zn were also analysed within the surface water and sediment. Increased nutrient concentrations within the water were evident during spring and summer at some of the sites, which influenced other water quality variables, e. g., dissolved oxygen and pH. Seasonal trends in metal concentrations were influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions (e. g., rainfall) experienced at the selected sites as well as physical and chemical properties (e. g., grain size and organic carbon content). This study showed distinct seasonal variability of water and sediment quality parameters in endorheic reed pans on the Mpumalanga Highveld. There is a need for further studies on all of the different types of pans in terms of their water and sediment quality. This type of information will allow for a sound and defensible scientific basis for the assessment of likely impacts (e. g., eutrophication), the evaluation of the significance of these impacts, and the design of remedial and preventative measures.

J	Wakelin, SC; Elefsiniotis, P; Wareham, DG				Wakelin, SC; Elefsiniotis, P; Wareham, DG			Assessment of stormwater retention basin water quality in Winnipeg, Canada	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												The water quality behaviour of 58 stormwater retention basins in Winnipeg, Canada, was intensively studied during a 5-month summer period (May to September). Dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, turbidity, transparency and depth were measured onsite. Samples analyzed in the laboratory included: total suspended solids (TSS), pH, chlorophyll a, fecal coliforms (FC), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia, nitrate, total phosphorus (TP) and orthophosphate. Results showed that increases in TSS and turbidity resulted from increased chlorophyll a concentrations associated with algal growth. TKN increases were partly the result of nitrogen incorporation into proteinaceous material in the algal cells. Ammonia concentrations showed a maximum attributed to chemoheterotrophic degradation of dead biomass. Orthophosphate made up 30% to 50% of the total phosphorus present and the two followed the same general trends. Temperature increased and then decreased over the summer months with no apparent thermal stratification. After starting the summer with no dissolved oxygen gradient between top and bottom, depletion of the dissolved oxygen at the bottom of the basins during the latter half of the summer was attributed to chemoheterotrophic degradation of dead biomass. Finally, substantial counts of fecal coliform. bacteria occurred in the basins in response to Canada geese migration.																			1201-3080						2003	38	3					433	450		10.2166/wqrj.2003.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2003.028													WOS:000184488100001
J	Thurman, EM; Bastian, KC; Mollhagen, T				Thurman, EM; Bastian, KC; Mollhagen, T			Occurrence of cotton herbicides and insecticides in playa lakes of the High Plains of West Texas	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												During the summer of 1997, water samples were collected and analyzed for pesticides from 32 playa lakes of the High Plains that receive drainage from both cotton and corn agriculture in West Texas. The major cotton herbicides detected in the water samples were diuron, fluometuron, metolachlor, norflurazon, and prometryn. Atrazine and propazine, corn and sorghum herbicides, were also routinely detected in samples from the playa lakes. Furthermore, the metabolites of all the herbicides studied were found in the playa lake samples. In some cases, the concentration of metabolites was equal to or exceeded the concentration of the parent compound. The types of metabolites detected suggested that the parent compounds had been transported to and had undergone degradation in the playa lakes. The types of metabolites and the ratio of metabolites to parent compounds may be useful in indicating the time that the herbicides were transported to the playa lakes. The median concentration of total herbicides was 7.2 mu g/l, with the largest total concentrations exceeding 30 mu g/l. Organophosphate insecticides were detected in only one water sample. Further work will improve the understanding of the fate of these compounds in the playa lake area. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.					; Thurman, Earl/B-5131-2011	Bastian, K.

J	Johnson, KR; Ingram, BL				Johnson, KR; Ingram, BL			Spatial and temporal variability in the stable isotope systematics of modern precipitation in China: implications for paleoclimate reconstructions	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The stable isotopic composition of materials such as glacial ice, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems from low-to-mid latitudes contains information about past changes in temperature (T) and precipitation amount (P). However, the transfer functions which link delta(18)O(p) to changes in T or P, ddelta(18)O(p)/dT and ddelta(18)O(p)/dP, can exhibit significant temporal and spatial variability in these regions. In areas affected by the Southeast Asian monsoon, past variations in delta(18)O and deltaD of precipitation have been attributed to variations in monsoon intensity, storm tracks, and/ or variations in temperature. Proper interpretation of past delta(18)O(p) variations here requires an understanding of these complicated stable isotope systematics. Since temperature and precipitation are positively correlated in China and have opposite effects on delta(18)O(p), it is necessary to determine which of these effects is dominant for a specific region in order to perform even qualitative paleoclimate reconstructions. Here, we evaluate the value of the transfer functions in modem precipitation to more accurately interpret the paleorecord. The strength of these transfer functions in China is investigated using Multiple regression analysis of data from 10 sites within the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP). delta(18)O(P) is modeled as a function of both temperature and precipitation. The magnitude and signs of the transfer functions at any given site are closely related to the degree of summer monsoon influence. delta(18)O(p) values at sites with intense summer monsoon precipitation are more dependent on the amount of precipitation than on temperature, and therefore exhibit more negative values in the summer. In contrast, delta(18)O(p) values at sites that are unaffected by summer monsoon precipitation exhibit strong relationships between delta(18)O(p) and temperature. The sites that are near the northern limit of the summer monsoon exhibit dependence on both temperature and amount of precipitation. Comparison with simple linear models (delta(18)O(p) as a function of T or P) and a geographic model (delta(18)O(p) as a function of latitude and altitude) shows that the multiple regression model is more successful at reproducing delta(18)O(p) values at sites that are strongly influenced by the summer monsoon. The fact that the transfer function values are highly spatially variable and closely related to the degree of summer monsoon influence suggests that these values may also vary temporally. Since the Southeast Asian monsoon intensity is known to exhibit large variations on a number of timescales (annual to glacial-interglacial), and the magnitude and sign of the transfer functions is related to monsoon intensity, we suggest that as monsoon intensity changes, the magnitude and possibly even the sign of the transfer functions may vary. Therefore, quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on delta(18)O(p) variations may not be valid. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Matthews, WJ; Schorr, MS; Meador, MR				Matthews, WJ; Schorr, MS; Meador, MR			Effects of experimentally enhanced flows on fishes of a small Texas (USA) stream: Assessing the impact of interbasin transfer	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Completion of a large interbasin water transfer system in northern Texas (U.S.A.) provided the opportunity to test the effects of pre-planned, experimental increases (approximate to X30) in flow on the fish fauna of a small, low-gradient, natural stream that was included as part of the conveyance system. Water from Lake Texoma (Red River basin) was pumped via a 16-km pipeline to the headwaters of Sister Grove Creek (Trinity River basin), which then carried the donor water 50 km downstream to Lake Lavon. 2. Baseline (pre-transfer) data on the composition of fish assemblages at seven stations on the creek or at its confluence with the receiving reservoir were collected monthly for 3 years, and similar data were collected for 2 years during and after trial flows of Lake Texoma water to Sister Grove Creek. We also documented fish abundance at five creek stations immediately before and after three trial flow periods of 10-14 days each in summer and autumn. 3. Multivariate analysis of all routine monthly samples over the 5-year pre- and posttransfer period showed moderate changes in the fish fauna of the creek after initiation of the trial flows. Samples taken within a week before and after the artificial high flows showed little overall change in abundance of individual fish species, but at some stations the quantitative or qualitative change in composition of the local assemblage was substantial. 4. The trial flows lasted 2 weeks or less. Long-term effects of water transfer on the fish fauna of Sister Grove Creek can only be determined after the conveyance system goes into normal operation, with periods of artificial flow of longer duration.																			0046-5070					APR	1996	35	2					349	362		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00494.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00494.x													WOS:A1996UK10100013

Tibetan Plateau (Tiancai Lake, SW China, 3900 m a.s.l.) derived from a chironomid stratigraphy covering the last c.19.5 ka. The record highlights the interaction between tropical and high-latitude climate forcing through the changes in atmospheric circulation during the last deglaciation. The scale of the last glacial maximum (LGM) cooling is consistent with other tropical mountain regions at c.5 degrees C and a rapid recovery of temperatures at 19.0 ka is related to changes in adiabatic lapse rates at the end of the glaciation. The overall pattern of change shows that North Atlantic deglaciation climate events (the Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas cooling events and the Bolling-Allerod warm period) are all recorded, but the influence of the events decline as the deglaciation progresses. We relate these patterns to North Atlantic Deep water ventilating the Southern Ocean and to the consequent movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Indian Ocean Basin as transmitted through changes in the southern mid-latitude circulation.

This study uses the Zabuye Salt Lake travertine dam as the research object and U-Th dating as the chronological framework and proposes that the carbon and oxygen isotopes of travertine can be used as a precipitation index through the analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of spring water, and petrology, mineralogy, carbon and oxygen isotopes of travertine. The precipitation records of Zabuye Salt Lake over the last 800 years show a dry condition in 1191-1374 AD (Medieval Warm Period), a humid condition in 1374-1884 AD (Little Ice Age), and a dry condition in 1884-1982 AD (Current Warn Period), indicating a warm-dry/cold-moist climate pattern, which is consistent with precipitation records from many places on the Tibetan Plateau. We preliminarily point out that travertine can record the evolution of paleoprecipitation (paleomonsoon) at least on the decadal-centennial scale. The Indian summer monsoon has been the main factor influencing precipitation change in Zabuye Salt Lake over the past 800 years, and the change in evapotranspiration intensity caused by temperature change driven by solar radiation is also an important factor affecting dry-moist change.					wang, chenguang/AAE-4990-2020; Wang, Xuefeng/GXF-6538-2022; ye, chuanyong/MGT-3699-2025; li, mingming/KXR-5760-2024	Wang, Xuefeng/0000-0002-5759-6920; 														2075-163X				JUL	2022	12	7							916	10.3390/min12070916	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min12070916													WOS:000832237700001

For this paper, we took the desert on the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake as the study area. We analyzed a variety of aged Hippophae rhamnoides communities and aeolian activities, and we discuss the relationship between them. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) With an increasing number of binding years, the species composition became more abundant, natural vegetation began to recover, and biodiversity increased year by year. At the same time, plant height, canopy width, and community coverage increased, but H. rhamnoides coverage was reduced to 36.70% as coverage of Artemisia desertorum increased to 25.67% after 10 years of fixing. The biomass of H. rhamnoides increased significantly, especially the underground biomass. For example, the biomass of area 15a was about 10 to 30 times that of area 1a. (2) Plants are a useful obstacle to aeolian activity. The presence of plants reduced the wind flow in the upper parts of the plants, but it did not have obvious regular characteristics. The longer the fixation term, the lower the surface sediment transport. It is significant that the sediment transport amount in winter was four times that in the summer. After 15 years of binding, H. rhamnoides grows well, and the community is still stable in the study area.

Annual tree-ring width at this site has been found to be negatively correlated with temperature of the previous summer. This relationship is genuine, metabolically plausible, and cannot be explained as an indirect correlation mediated by hydroclimate. The resulting reconstruction (NCZTjaso) represents the southernmost annually resolved temperature record based on tree-rings in Europe and provides detailed information on the regional climate evolution during the Late Holocene in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula. The tree-ring based temperature reconstruction of Cazorla Range reveals predominantly warm summer temperatures during the transition between the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) from the 13th to the mid of the sixteenth century. The LIA spanned a slightly longer time (1500-1930 CE) than in other European summer temperature reconstructions from the Alps and Pyrenees. The twentieth century, though warmer than the preceding centuries, does not show unprecedented warmth in the last 800 years. Three ensembles of climate simulations conducted with two global atmosphereocean general circulation climate models (GCMs), considering different external forcings, were used for comparison: ECHO-G (Erik) and MPI-ESM (E1 and E2). Additionally, individual simulations were available from GCM included in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, as well as single-forcing simulations performed with MPI-ESM. The comparison of the reconstructed and simulated temperatures revealed a close agreement of NCZTjaso with the simulations performed with total solar irradiance forcing with wider amplitude. Furthermore, the correlations with single-forcing simulations suggest volcanism as the main factor controlling preindustrial summer temperature variations in the Cazorla Range over the last five centuries. The persistent anti-correlation between NCZTjaso and simulated temperatures during the MCA-LIA transitional period underlines the current limitations for attributing temperature variations during that period to internal variability or external forcing.					; Campelo, Filipe/D-6931-2011; Gutierrez, Emilia/O-7568-2014; Andreu-Hayles, Laia/H-6200-2012; Dorado Linan, Isabel/B-4393-2017; González-Rouco, Jesús Fidel/B-1761-2012; Gonzalez-Rouco, Jesus Fidel/B-1761-2012; Liñán, Isabel/AAR-1539-2020	Muntan, Elena/0000-0002-0687-6877; Campelo, Filipe/0000-0001-6022-9948; Andreu-Hayles, Laia/0000-0003-4185-681X; GUTIERREZ MERINO, Emilia/0000-0002-6085-5700; Dorado Linan, Isabel/0000-0002-8913-0420; Gonzalez-Rouco, Jesus Fidel/0000-0001-7090-6797; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	2015	44	1-2					75	93		10.1007/s00382-014-2348-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2348-5													WOS:000412014800001

Most of them are cosmopolitan, living in freshwater habitats. The Rumanian taxa occur usually in spring or early summer at water temperatures ranging between 4 degrees and 10 degrees C. They are most frequent in neutral or slightly acid, clear-watered, aquatic habitats of various types. However, Mallomonas paludosa Fott appears mostly in brown watered peatbog pools of low mineral contents, having a particular geographical area, with its southernmost limit in the Rumanian Eastern Carpathians. Its distribution, like that of other boreal elements, is strictly connected with the occurrence of genuine ombrogenic Sphagnum-bogs, which have their southern limit also in Romania. The other two species dealt with - M. cyathellata Wujek & Asmund and M. portae-ferreae Peterfi & Asmund -, occurring in circumneutral or moderately alkaline waters of eutrophic character, are apparently warm water forms, mostly distributed in tropical, subtropical or mediterranean zones. The Rumanian localities (in the Danube Delta and at Eselnita near the Danube, up stream Drobeta Turnu-Severin) might be the northern limits of M. portae-ferreae in Eastern Europe. The Danube Delta is the only locality of M. cyathellata in Europe, and its northernmost occurrence as well. The occurrence of both species in Rumania is presumably due to migratory waterfowl.																			0018-8158					OCT 25	1996	336	1-3					143	150		10.1007/BF00010828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010828													WOS:A1996WB14500015

Bernhart			An unusual occurrence of the trace fossil Vagorichnus preserved in hydrothermal silica at Lake Baringo, Kenya Rift Valley: Taphonomic and paleoenvironmental significance	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												An unusual occurrence of the ichnogenus Vagorichnus is documented in the sublacustrine hydrothermal silica cement of conglomerate at Lake Baringo in the central Kenya Rift. The outcrop with ichnofossils lies at Soro on the NE shoreline of Ol Kokwe island, a Pleistocene volcanic centre in Lake Baringo. There, onshore and offshore hot springs discharge hot and boiling (83-97.5 degrees C), alkaline Na-HCO3 water, steam and volcanic gases (mainly CO2). The ichnofossils are preserved in full relief in diatomaceous opaline silica cement precipitated between immature gravel clasts. The trace fossils comprise horizontal and subhorizontal burrow-systems with straight, curved, and loosely meandering segments, which locally show poorly defined constrictions. The preserved features are diagnostic of the ichnospecies Vagorichnus anyao. Vagorichnus, a feeding structure (fodinichnion), may have been produced by insect larvae (Diptera, Coleoptera or other insects), which are common in modern East African lakes including Lake Baringo. A probable body fossil of a Diptera larva is preserved in one of the burrows. Hydro thermal silica is an unlikely host for macroscale ichnofossils, but the soft silica that precipitated near hot-spring vents on the shallow gravelly lake-floor was cool enough for colonisation by microbes and higher organisms. The trace-makers burrowed into cohesive, but still soft, silica: the trace fossils are therefore bioturbation structures rather than bioerosion structures. The soft silica contained organic matter from phytoplankton and detrital plant debris, and was locally covered by benthic microbial mats, all of which were potential food sources for the burrowers. The presence of Vagorichnus near modern and former hot springs confirms the broad ecological, hydrological and environmental conditions represented by this ichnogenus, and shows that Vagorichnus is not restricted to a specific environment, substrate, or type of lake basin.

J	Lacey, JH; Jones, MD				Lacey, Jack H.; Jones, Matthew D.			Quantitative reconstruction of early Holocene and last glacial climate on the Balkan Peninsula using coupled hydrological and isotope mass balance modelling	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We investigate the modern hydrology of Lake Ohrid (Macedonia/Albania) using a combined hydrological and isotope-based modelling approach and present a new evaluation of contemporary water balance and palaeoclimate estimates. The combined model is able to estimate hydrological components that cannot be directly measured, and indicates that sublacustrine spring inflow is in the order of 50% higher than previous estimates and groundwater outflow comprises approximately a third of overall water outflow. In combination with sediment core oxygen isotope data, we used the combined model to quantitatively reconstruct past climate, in particular precipitation, during the early Holocene and last glacial period. Calculated precipitation in the early Holocene was higher than the value for present day and was approximately 44% lower than present during the last glacial, assuming the majority of precipitation fell as snow. The estimated amount of precipitation in the last glacial would have been high enough to provide refugial conditions at Lake Ohrid and to support the continuous existence of arboreal vegetation in the catchment. The improved understanding of the modern isotope hydrology of Lake Ohrid is fundamental for explaining the systematics of past isotope variation and providing context for extended sediment records from the lake, which will provide longer-term palaeoclimate reconstructions covering multiple glacial-interglacial cycles.

Short Communication Characterising Runoff Generation Processes in a Lake- Rich Thermokarst Landscape ( Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada) using d18O, d2H and d- excess Measurements	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Application of novel hydrological methods for assessing runoff generation in remote northern landscapes is necessary to identify the consequences of climate variability and change. In Old Crow Flats, a lake-rich thermokarst landscape in northern Yukon Territory (Canada), local land users have concerns over the effects of recent lake drainage and fluctuating river discharge on their traditional way of life. In the absence of hydrometric stations, we evaluate the utility of isotopic monitoring of the lower Old Crow River, which is fed by several tributaries and drains the flats, for tracking runoff generation. Isotopic snapshots' obtained from 2007, 2008 and 2009 during the recession limb of the spring freshet hydrograph provided characteristic patterns of deuterium excess (d-excess) along the Old Crow River. River sampling in June 2007 captured a pulse of evaporatively enriched lake water originating from a rainfall-triggered catastrophic lake drainage event, identified by decreased d-excess values. June 2008 was marked by negligible variability in d-excess values along the same reach of the river, consistent with minimal export of lake waters after a winter of below-normal snow accumulation. In contrast, rising d-excess values along the study reach in June 2009 indicate enhanced rainfall-generated runoff. River isotope sampling could be used to monitor spatial and temporal variability in runoff generation processes in the Old Crow Flats and other northern lake-rich landscapes drained by rivers.

The fossils are preserved as rows of 2-3 tubers. The tubers are elliptical, ovate and more or less rounded, the most distal one being mucronate, with some ridges on the surface of the tubers. According to the similarity of the morphology and arrangement with extant Equisetum subgenus Equisetum, the present fossils are assigned to a new species of Equisetum. Furthermore, the cellular details of the tubers are clearly revealed for the first time. And the cellular morphology of extant Equisetum tubers can be compared to those of the fossil species. The occurrence of Equisetum would suggest a wet habitat, and the presence of tubers implies that burial occurred during the late fall or winter. Based on the palynological assemblages and mega-fossil assemblages, it had been thought that in the Early Cretaceous the Jiuquan Basin was arid, but the living habitat of Equisetum indicates a wet, riparian environment. Therefore, the occurrence of fossil Equisetum associated with fishes and ostracodes in the lower sequence would suggest a locally wet environment, probably a lake-shore in an arid region during the late Early Cretaceous in the Jiuquan Basin. The study is of great significance for further interpretation of the paleoclimate and environment in the Early Cretaceous of Northwest China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water and sediment act as reservoirs for microbial taxa associated with invasive dreissenid mussels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are invasive, filter-feeding, bivalves that have disrupted the ecology of thousands of freshwater biomes across North America. Due to their efficient filter-feeding activity, zebra mussels (ZMs) and other bivalves are extensively used to detect chemical contamination in waterways. In this study, we evaluated whether water and sediment serve as major sources of ZM tissue-associated microbiota, and whether ZMs serve as a reservoir for potentially pathogenic microbes in aquatic systems. High-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was done to characterize the microbial community structure in 472 environmental samples, comprising ZMs, sediment, and the water column, collected from 15 lakes during the summer and fall months. Sequence analyses, done using the SourceTracker program, predicted that water and sediment contributed up to 91 and 86%, respectively, to the structure of microbiota within ZMs, and that mussels from the same site showed nearly identical source microbiota profiles. The relatively high local source contribution suggests that the microbiota in ZM tissue has the potential to reflect biological contamination and this phenomenon can be used to monitor microbial water quality. A preferential enrichment of several taxa was also observed in ZM tissues, including potential pathogenic groups such as Aeromonas, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas. Taken together, our results contribute to an improved understanding of ZMs as a sentinel species in aquatic habitats and its potential impact to water quality management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Transition from stromatolite to thrombolite fabric: potential role for reticulopodial protists in lake microbialites of a Proterozoic ecosystem analog	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Prior observations suggest that foraminiferan protists use their reticulopodia (anastomosing pseudopodia) to alter sediment fabric by disrupting laminations of subtidal marine stromatolites, erasing the layered structures in an experimental setting. Because microbialites and foraminifera are found in non-marine settings, we hypothesized that foraminifera living in lakes could also disrupt layered microbialite fabric. With this aim and using a variety of multidisciplinary approaches, we conducted field surveys and an experiment on microbialites from Green Lake (GL; Fayetteville, New York State, United States), which has been studied as a Proterozoic ecosystem analog. The lake is meromictic and alkaline, receiving calcium sulfate-rich water in the monimolimnion; it supports a well-developed carbonate platform that provides access to living and relict microbialites. The living microbialites grow from early spring to autumn, forming a laminated mat at their surface (top similar to 5 mm), but a clotted or massive structure exists at depth (> similar to 1 cm). We observed a morphotype of "naked" foraminiferan-like protist in samples from GL microbialites and sediments; thus, considered the possibility of freshwater foraminiferan impact on microbialite fabric. Results of an experiment that seeded the cultured freshwater foraminifer Haplomyxa saranae onto the GL microbialite surface indicates via micro-CT scanning and anisotropy analysis that the introduced foraminifer impacted uppermost microbialite layering (n = 3 cores); those cores with an added inhibitor lacked changes in anisotropy for two of those three cores. Thus, it remains plausible that the much smaller, relatively common, native free-form reticulate protist, which we identified as Chlamydomyxa labyrinthuloides, can disrupt microbialite fabrics on sub-millimeter scales. Our observations do not exclude contributions of other possible causal factors.

Research on microplastic concentration in aquatic environment is attracting scientists from developing countries, but in Nepal no information regarding microplastic in freshwater system is available. Therefore, this study investigates the presence and abundance of microplastic in lake surface water of Phewa Lake, the second largest lake in Nepal. The average concentration of microplastic for surface water was 2.96 +/- 1.83 particles/L in winter (dry) season and 1.51 +/- 0.62 particles/L in rainy (wet) season. Significant difference with t = 4.687 (p < 0.01) in microplastic concentration was observed in two different seasons. Fibers (93.04% for winter and 96.69% for rainy season) were the commonly found microplastic type in lake water and transparent as the dominant color for the two seasons. Almost all the detected microplastic were found to be < 1 mm in size. Due to the small size of microplastic and unavailability of micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (mu-FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy in Nepal, polymer identification was not done. The findings from this study can provide a valuable baseline data on microplastics for the first time in Nepal's freshwater lake environment.					; Pradhan, Bijay/ADP-5283-2022; Prasai Joshi, Tista/AFO-6035-2022; Malla-Pradhan, Rajeshwori/JRY-6257-2023; Phoungthong, Khamphe/N-2496-2019	Malla-Pradhan, Rajeshwori/0000-0002-6474-3650; Prasai Joshi, Tista/0000-0003-4783-8452; Pradhan, Dr. Bijay Lal/0000-0001-5673-4415; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2022	29	26					39928	39936		10.1007/s11356-021-18301-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18301-9		FEB 2022						35112255					WOS:000749986900007

The CO2 flux from hydrothermal systems of the Karymsky volcanic Centre, Kamchatka	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union				The CO2 flux provided by the hydrothermal activity within the Karymsky Volcanic Centre, Kamchatka, was measured, and the CO2 balance of the Karymsky caldera lake was estimated in the framework of a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) project. The Karymsky Volcanic Centre located in the SE of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the middle of the modern volcanic front consists of two calderas, hosts a caldera lake and is characterized by hydro thermal activity that is manifested at several thermal fields. Within the Akademii Nauk (AN) caldera which is filled by a caldera lake, the Akademii Nauk springs discharge boiling water into the lake. The lake is drained by the Karymsky River that then crosses the caldera of the Karymsky volcano (Karymsky caldera) and drains the thermal field of CO2-rich Karymsky springs. The lake after the 1996 sublimnic eruption is in a steady-state condition with the total dynamic CO2 budget of about 4 t/day, and has a total amount of CO2 stored inside of the lake of around 8000 t. The thermal springs of the Karymsky caldera drained by the Karymsky River enrich the river in dissolved carbon species. A total CO2 output of 320 t/day from both Karymsky Centre calderas was estimated, carrying around 130 t/day carbon species (expressed as CO2) as dissolved species (HCO3 and CO2(aq)), and emitting to the atmosphere around 190 t/day of CO2 as the diffusion flux from the soil and bubbling emanations from the springs.

J	Boivin, S; Begin, Y				Boivin, S; Begin, Y			Development of a black spruce (Picea mariana) shoreline stand in relation to snow level variations at Lake Bienville in northern Quebec	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												This study proposes a reconstruction of the past development of a forest stand submitted to long-term variations of snow levels. As of the 19th century, a gradient in tree-growth forms developed in a post-fire shoreline stand. This expansion was marked by three stages. (1) Prior to 1845, the effects of fire (between 1806 and 1826) increased the exposure stress on surviving trees, which started to develop irregular growth forms in response to niveo-eolian erosion. Post-fire regeneration expanded progressively toward the inner part of the island. (2) Afterwards (1845-1880), severe winter and summer conditions were marked by numerous unsuccessful snow-air interface breakthroughs, as shown by frequent loss of apical dominance. (3) Since 1880, the densification of above-snow tree structures contributed to the overaccumulation of snow that caused many injuries to trees (branch tearing, stem bending). The frequent damage (since the 1900s) and the raised level of above-snow erosional features (loss of apical dominance) indicate that increasing forest density merely exacerbated the rising trend of snowfalls in the forest studied. This trend, demonstrated earlier in the northern areas of the forest-tundra, was not yet documented at the limit of the southern boreal forest.																			0045-5067					MAR	1997	27	3					295	303		10.1139/x96-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x96-173													WOS:A1997XD79300003

However, without proper control, the pollutants absorbed by plants can remain in plant litter and return to the water body in the plant fall season, resulting in secondary pollution. To reuse plant litter and further enhance the ecological function of lakebanks, in this study, plant litter was collected to produce biochar, which was incorporated into the lakebank soil in a microcosm. Then, the results and mechanisms of nitrogen (N) interception/removal by biochar-amended soil (biochar-based lakebank) were examined in the plant fall season (December-February) and growth season ( June-August), respectively. The results showed that: (1) in both plant fall and growth seasons, the biochar-based lakebank exhibited higher total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate N (NO3--N) removal efficiency from runoff than natural lakebank, especially in the plant growth season; (2) in the plant growth season, the TN removal efficiency of biochar-based lakebank increased by 32.85%, 12.00%, and 18.97%, and NO3--N removal efficiency increased by 218.19%, 67.22%, and 85.91% under low, medium, and high influent pollution loads, respectively, when compared with those of natural lakebank; and (3) biochar amendment into soil promoted plant growth and increased the abundance of microorganisms related to the N cycle such as nitrobacteria, nitrifying bacteria, and aerobic denitrifying bacteria, which can further enhance the ecological function of lakebank in N removal from runoff.					; Wang, Lei/HJY-0156-2023; xiaojuan, lu/MTC-3434-2025	Wang, Lei/0000-0001-8381-1703; 													1092-8758	1557-9018				MAR	2022	39	3					235	247		10.1089/ees.2021.0098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2021.0098		AUG 2021											WOS:000689737600001

While two of the locations were close to a suspected source of the organochlorines, five were sites that reflected the non-urban airshed loadings which are considered to be regionally representative of the Great Lakes. At the non-urban locations, the gamma-HCH (lindane) and alpha-HCH concentrations ranged from 15 to 190 pg m-3 (mean of 47 pg m-3) and 50 to 660 pg m-3 (mean of 240 pg m-3), respectively. The HCB concentrations varied from 20 to 310 pg m-3 (mean of 94 pg m-3). At the suspected source locations, the alpha:gamma HCH ratio was less than unity while at locations distant from known or suspected sources, the alpha:gamma ratio was usually greater than 7. At the non-urban locations, the highest concentrations of the alpha- and gamma-HCH isomers were observed during the summer and the lowest concentrations were seen during the winter. The concentration of HCB, however, remained relatively constant throughout the year.

Nutrient Dynamics in Partially Drained Arctic Thaw Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Thaw lakes are ubiquitous on arctic coastal plains (ACPs). While many thaw lakes have steep banks, stable water levels, and static surface areas, others only partially fill their basins and vary in area over the summer. These partially drained lakes (PDLs) are hydrologically connected to the wetlands immediately surrounding them. Heat and nutrient availability limit aquatic productivity on ACPs, and we hypothesized that shallow shorelines and greater hydrologic connectivity with the landscape should result in greater nutrient concentrations and biogeochemical cycling in PDLs. We tested this by monitoring water chemistry in lakes with varying levels of seasonal drainage in sandy and silty peaty lowland sites on the ACP of Alaska. One highly drained lake (N1) was significantly warmer than minimally drained lakes (minDLs) related to earlier ice off, reaching temperatures as high as 16 degrees C in June when minDLs still contained ice. Ammonia, total dissolved phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations were higher in lakes with greater drainage, and concentrations in N1 rivaled those in the small, biologically productive ponds. Many PDLs displayed a midsummer decrease in nutrients consistent with assimilation by the aquatic ecosystem, and a late-summer increase most likely related to runoff from drained lake margins following precipitation. N1 exported kilograms of ammonium and total dissolved phosphorus to the stream network over the summer. Given increased warming and drying in the arctic, the proportion of PDLs may be changing, which in turn may affect nutrient and organic matter availability in arctic lakes and export to downstream environments.					; Koch, Joshua/MZS-1086-2025	Koch, Joshua/0000-0001-7180-6982; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB	2018	123	2					440	452		10.1002/2017JG004187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JG004187													WOS:000427478500008

However, there is a dearth of information on environmental conditions, which may orchestrate divergence processes across generations. Here we explore whether the environmental factors affecting food and reproductive niche distinctions could trigger the divergence of the lacustrine-riverine fish species into two morphs based on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka of the Lake Kronotskoe. We reveal drastic differences in temperature on the tributary reproduction sites affecting the early ontogeny timing and disrupting the time of lakeward migration of the morphs. The juveniles of the benthivorous morph run into the lake in spring during the food abundance peak on the slope, while the planktivorous kokanee migrates to the lake in the summer when the pelagic zone abounds with zooplankton. The dynamics of this food niches is determined by water temperature dynamics and may be stable for long periods of time, thus making each morph adapting to similar condition throughout generations. We suggest that the pelagic-benthic divergence could be explained by the factors, which are extrinsic for fish, making our results applicable for numerous cases of this microevolutionary pathway all over the Holarctic.

Lichen diversity of such steppe slopes was studied in the western Khentey Mountains, located between the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator and Lake Baikal. Functional types of lichen species were analyzed and measurements of microclimate were carried out as a first approach to figure out relevant site factors that control lichen distribution in the different habitat types of the steppe slopes. Such habitats include meadow steppe, siliceous rock and savanna-like Ulmus pumila open woodlands. Dominance of chlorolichens with either yellow or orange lichen substances (usnic acid, parietin, pulvinic acid derivatives) or melanin in the cortex, which absorb both ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and visible light usable for photosynthesis (PAR) suggests that effective protection against high solar irradiation is a crucial selective factor for lichens on the steppe slopes. The slopes are subject to high irradiation because of their steepness and because of the ultracontinental climate. In Betula platyphylla-Larix sibirica light taiga forest bordering the steppe on northern slopes, lichens with and without effective photoprotection co-occur. A second important factor, apparently influencing lichen distribution of the study area is water availability. Low precipitation, which falls in numerous small rain showers, combined with frequent dewfall in summer favors chlorolichens and explains the limitation of cyanolichens to particularly moist microsites, such as water runoffs on rocks or moss cushions on inclined or horizontal tree trunks. Ecophysiological measurements to prove these hypotheses on the significance of sunlight and water availability for lichen performance in the study area have not yet been carried out.

Detection of a colonizing, aquatic, non-indigenous species	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Detecting the presence of rare species has interested ecologists and conservation biologists for many years. A particularly daunting application of this problem pertains to the detection of non-indigenous species (NIS) as they colonize new ecosystems. Ethical issues prevent experimental additions of NIS to most natural systems to explore the relationship between sampling intensity and the detection probability of a colonizing NIS. Here we examine this question using a recently introduced water flea, Cercopagis pengoi, in Lake Ontario. The species has biphasic population development, with sexually-produced 'spring morphs' developing prior to parthenogenetically-produced 'typical' morphs. Thus, this biphasic morphology allows distinction between new colonists (spring morphs) from subsequent generations. We repeatedly sampled Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario for the presence of both spring and typical morphs. Probability of detection was positively related to both the number of samples taken and animal density in the lake; however, even highly intensive sampling (100 samples) failed to detect the species in early spring when densities were very low. Spatial variation was greatest when densities of Cercopagis were intermediate to low. Sub-sampling, which increased space between adjacent samples, significantly decreased the number of samples required to reach greater, calculated detection probabilities on these dates. Typical sampling protocols for zooplankton have a low probability (< 0.2) of detecting the species unless population density is high. Results of this study suggest that early detection of colonizing, aquatic NIS may be optimized through use of a risk-based sampling design, combined with high sampling intensity in areas deemed most vulnerable to invasion, rather than less intensive sampling at a wider array of sites.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020														1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2009	15	3					429	437		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00550.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00550.x													WOS:000265070400007

Lake Rodo is a turbid system, a condition attributed to algal biomass. The proximal source of the eutrophication was stormwater discharges from an ill-defined urban area. This paper describes an attempt to restore the water quality of Lake Rodo, the first time this has been done in Uruguay. In spring 1996 it was drained, sediments were removed and stream inputs were diverted. Groundwater was used to re-fill the lake. Due to its high nutrient concentration a re-circulation system was designed, pumping water from associated pools covered with free-floating plants. 2. After the lake was refilled, the system was characterized by oxygen saturation or over-saturation, neutral to basic pH, and high phosphorus, nitrogen and silicate concentrations. Ratios of total nitrogen (TN):total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a):TP indicated that phosphorus was the primary limiting nutrient during the period of groundwater supply. Once groundwater pumping had ceased, there was a decrease in TN:TP and Chl a:TP ratios, suggesting N-limiting conditions prevailed in some periods. 3. Before restoration, the phytoplankton community was dominated year-round by Planktothrix agardhii; since restoration the community has been more diverse. This change has favoured grazing by mesozooplankton, and the onset of clear-water phases in spring. 4. Abundant populations of small omnivorous fish maintained a high predation pressure on zooplankton, restricting the abundance of large-bodied herbivores, which, in turn, allowed an increase in phytoplanton biomass and a decrease in water transparency. Based on this observation, together with the phosphorus concentration and the low abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria compared with previous studies, we suggest that top-down control has played a key role in increasing transparency in Lake Rodo. 5. A nutrient reduction programme, by the mechanical harvest of floating plants, and a removal of small omnivorous fishes and stocking strictly with piscivores, could be key factors in the achievement of a stable clear-water phase. However, if blooms of Microcystis or other similar genera occur in summer, additional measures (e.g. reduction of the hydraulic residence time) will be needed to improve water transparency.

Experimental lowering of the pH, using a strong acid, in a laboratory water-sediment system and in pond water revealed qualitatively similar changes to those in the naturally acidified pond: decreases in-water colour, dissolved organic material and total Fe, and increases in total Ca, Mg and Al concentrations. The effects of acidification, together with the simultaneously increased bioavailability of aluminium, were assessed on crucian carp, the only fish species present, by comparison with data from a connected pond that retained its normal pH (> 6.0). The growth in the length of the fish did not differ significantly between the ponds, and the liver glycogen stores were actually slightly larger in the acidic pond. Yet, finds of dead fish after 4 months of acidification, suggested high mortality. In comparison with the carp in the reference pond, the crucian carp in the acidified pond suffered from ionoregulatory imbalance and chronic stress, indicated by decreased plasma chloride, and increased cortisol and glucose concentrations, respectively. In addition, their blood haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration were elevated and the relative size of their livers had increased.																			0003-455X						1992	29	1					29	38																WOS:A1992HU88000003

ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												The Kusatsu and Tamagawa hot springs contain both toxic elements and rare metals used in high-technology industries. High acidity and significant discharge of these springs have led to the construction of dams and neutralization of spring waters by lime addition. However, the same neutralization process causes differing effects in the Kusatsu and Tamagawa areas. This study focuses on the effects of neutralization on fractionation between arsenic (As) and indium (In) during river transport and precipitation of these elements on the lake beds. The Yubatake thermal waters in the Kusatsu area are rapidly neutralized after addition of a lime suspension. After this neutralization, the dissolved As and In are nearly completely removed by sorption onto suspended hydrous ferric oxides (HFO), which then settle out and are added to sediments within a man-made lake without significant fractionation. In contrast, the Obuki thermal waters in the Tamagawa area are neutralized by both addition of lime and by mixing with tributary streams, leading to a gradual downstream increase in pH. Arsenic tends to be sorbed by HFO in upstream areas, leading to wide dispersal of As across the entire watershed. In comparison, In is transported to the lake inlet as stable chloride and/or sulfate complexes without significant removal, with considerable portions being precipitated in a man-made lake. As a result, In is effectively concentrated within downstream lake sediments.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				NOV	2013	108	7					1641	1656		10.2113/econgeo.108.7.1641	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/econgeo.108.7.1641													WOS:000325836500006

Spring climate warming is associated with earlier spawn timing of an adfluvial trout population	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phenological shifts are being observed in salmonid fish in response to climate change. Between 1961 and 2021, daily spawner counts have taken place during the spawning season and climate and hydrologic measurements have been measured continuously near the spawning site for Gerrard rainbow trout in British Columbia, Canada. Trend and multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine phenological shifts and associated climate and hydrology metrics. Over the 61-year time series, the timing of peak spawning shifted earlier by 7.7 days and the duration of the spawning period shortened by 12.3 days due to the spawning season ending earlier; the timing of the start of the spawning season did not change. The shift in peak spawn timing was associated most strongly with an increase in early spring (March-April) air temperature (2.2 degrees C), an increase in water temperature (1.3 degrees C), and less strongly with hydrology metrics. Mountainous regions are experiencing earlier and warmer springs. Adfluvial trout populations in these regions such as Gerrard rainbow trout may be remaining resilient at least partially through adaptation of phenology.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					2025	82								0036	10.1139/cjfas-2025-0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2025-0036													WOS:001563106200001
J	Lang, JH; Ma, YM; Li, ZG; Su, DS				Lang, Jiahe; Ma, Yaoming; Li, Zhaoguo; Su, Dongsheng			The Impact of Climate Warming on Lake Surface Heat Exchange and Ice Phenology of Different Types of Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau	WATER												Increasing air temperature is a significant feature of climate warming, and is cause for some concern, particularly on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A lack of observations means that the impact of rising air temperatures on TP lakes has received little attention. Lake surfaces play a unique role in determining local and regional climate. This study analyzed the effect of increasing air temperature on lake surface temperature (LST), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and ice phenology at Lake Nam Co and Lake Ngoring, which have mean depths of approximately 40 m and 25 m, respectively, and are in the central and eastern TP, respectively. The variables were simulated using an adjusted Fresh-water Lake (FLake) model (FLake_alpha_ice = 0.15). The simulated results were evaluated against in situ observations of LST, LE and H, and against LST data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2015 to 2016. The simulations show that when the air temperature increases, LST increases, and the rate of increase is greater in winter than in summer; annual LE increases; H and ice thickness decrease; ice freeze-up date is delayed; and the break-up date advances. The changes in the variables in response to the temperature increases are similar at the two lakes from August to December, but are significantly different from December to July.

This unprecedented winter opening of the spillway coincided with the spawning season and larval ingress period for Gulf Menhaden, a forage fish species that supports the largest commercial fishery in the region. Oceanographic observations and plankton samples were collected in the Mississippi Bight region shortly after the Bonnet Carre ' Spillway winter opening to examine the impacts on larval Gulf Menhaden feeding, growth and condition. Three distinct water masses were identified based on temperature, salinity, and particle scattering (proxy for turbidity) characteristics. Larval Gulf Menhaden with the highest growth rates and body condition were collected in a water mass defined by relatively high temperature and salinity and relatively low turbidity and zooplankton (prey) abundance. In contrast, larvae with the slowest growth rates and poor body condition were collected in a water mass with the highest zooplankton abundance, but also highest turbidity and lowest temperature and salinity. This water mass was nearest the diversion outflow and most impacted by the spillway opening. Our results indicate that the anomalous freshwater discharge event resulted in hydrographic conditions that diminished otherwise favorable larval fish foraging habitat with abundant zooplankton prey. These findings suggest that the recent trend of Bonnet Carre ' Spillway openings may result in negative consequences for larval fish survival and subsequent fishery recruitment.

Material consisting of numerical weather prediction model (HIRLAM) output, weather station observations, manual snow and ice observations, high spatial resolution snow and ice temperatures from ice mass balance buoys (SIMB), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) lake ice surface temperature observations was gathered. A snow/ice model (HIGHTSI) was applied to simulate the evolution of the snow and ice surface energy balance, temperature profiles and thickness. The weather conditions in early winter were found critical in determining the seasonal evolution of the thickness of lake ice and snow. During the winter season (Nov.-Apr.), precipitation, longwave radiative flux and air temperature showed large inter-annual variations. The uncertainty in snow/ice model simulations originating from precipitation was investigated. The contribution of snow to ice transformation was vital for the total lake ice thickness. At the seasonal time scale, the ice bottom growth was 50-70% of the total ice growth. The SIMB is suitable for monitoring snow and ice temperatures and thicknesses. The Mean Bias Error (MBE) between the SIMB and borehole measurements was -0.7 cm for snow thicknesses and 1.7 cm for ice thickness. The temporal evolution of MODIS surface temperature (three seasons) agrees well with SIMB and HIGHTSI results (correlation coefficient, R = 0.81). The HIGHTSI surface temperatures were, however, higher (2.8 degrees C <= MBE <= 3.9 degrees C) than the MODIS observations. The development of HIRLAM by increasing its horizontal and vertical resolution and including a lake parameterisation scheme improved the atmospheric forcing for HIGHTSI, especially the relative humidity and solar radiation. Challenges remain in accurate simulation of snowfall events and total precipitation.					; Kontu, Anna/O-8886-2014; Pulliainen, Jouni/Y-4810-2019; Vihma, Timo/ABC-9771-2020; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Rontu, Laura/0000-0003-1215-1546; Kontu, Anna/0000-0001-6880-6260; Pulliainen, Jouni/0000-0003-1157-2920; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 														1600-0870					2014	66								21564	10.3402/tellusa.v66.21564	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v66.21564													WOS:000335923600001

Diet and Habitat of Mountain Woodland Caribou Inferred from Dung Preserved in 5000-year-old Alpine Ice in the Selwyn Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada	ARCTIC												Alpine ice patches are unique repositories of cryogenically preserved archaeological artefacts and biological specimens. Recent melting of ice in the Selwyn Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada, has exposed layers of dung accumulated during seasonal use of ice patches by mountain woodland caribou of the ancestral Redstone population over the past ca. 5250 years. Although attempts to isolate the DNA of known caribou parasites were unsuccessful, the dung has yielded numerous well-preserved and diverse plant remains and palynomorphs. Plant remains preserved in dung suggest that the ancestral Redstone caribou population foraged on a variety of lichens (30%), bryophytes and lycopods (26.7%), shrubs (21.6%), grasses (10.5%), sedges (7.8%), and forbs (3.4%) during summer use of alpine ice. Dung palynomorph assemblages depict a mosaic of plant communities growing in the caribou's summer habitat, including downslope boreal components and upslope floristically diverse herbaceous communities. Pollen and spore content of dung is only broadly similar to late Holocene assemblages preserved in lake sediments and peat in the study region, and differences are likely due to the influence of local vegetation and animal forage behaviour. The 5000-year legacy of summer use of alpine ice patches by mountain woodland caribou suggests that these small, long-lived features may be important for the health of caribou populations in the Selwyn/Mackenzie Mountain range.

To assess its compliance with these discharge limits, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) monitored six representative sites for snowmelt and other storm water runoff from summer 2000 through spring 2003. In addition, Caltrans has investigated several existing double-barrel sand traps for their effectiveness in removing pollutants and complying with the Tahoe basin discharge limits. The results obtained to date indicate that (a) concentrations of pollutants found in the snowmelt runoff are higher than the specified storm water discharge limits; (b) double-barrel sand traps were capable of capturing sand and sediment, but the capture was not complete; (c) particles that range from 100 to 2,000 pm represented the highest proportion, but no correlation was found between particles and chemical concentrations; and (d) sand traps did provide modest improvement in runoff quality, but this improvement was insufficient to meet Tahoe basin discharge limits, and hence additional treatment was found to be needed to bring the effluent water quality into compliance.

Arsenic abundance and variation in golf course	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) is a commonly used herbicide on golf courses. To investigate the variation in abundance of arsenic (As) after MSMA application, 28 golf course lakes were monitored monthly for one year. The As concentrations varied substantially in and between individual lakes with values up to 124 mu g/L (mean=10.9 mu g/L, n=336). This is considerably higher than the As concentrations in comparable "non-golf course" lakes (up to 100-times) in the study area. The highest values of As in the lakes were generally observed in the late spring and early summer and corresponded to the intensity of MSMA applications. Arsenic seems to be sequestered by the golf course lake sediments with concentrations as high as 302 mg/kg, which were significantly higher than the 0.1 to 3 mg/kg expected for comparable sediments in central Florida. Arsenic correlates well with Fe in the top 15 cm of the lake sediments suggesting that As is sorbed by hydrous ferric oxides (HFO). As long as conditions are in favour of HFO stability, As is retained in the lake sediments preventing its migration into the Floridan aquifer systems. However, once the loading capacity of the sediment is reached or when as a result of changing physico-chemical conditions HFO may become unstable, As may enter the Floridan aquifer.

Here, we compare the impact of the NAO on the winter dynamics of Windermere, a lake located in the north-west of England, and Paajarvi, a take situated in southern Finland. At both sites, the variations in the NAO index had a significant effect on the winter weather and the physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes. At Windermere, the strongest correlations were those noted for the air temperature, precipitation, the number of days when ice was recorded on the take and the de-trended concentration of nitrate. At Paajarvi the strongest correlations were with the air temperature and the de-trended concentrations of nitrate. One striking difference between the sites was the sign of the correlations noted between the NAO index and the de-trended nitrate. At Windermere, this correlation was negative and appeared to be driven by the enhanced terrestrial uptake of nitrate in mild winters. At Paajarvi the correlation was positive and was associated with the earlier 'flush' of melt water from the catchment. The results are discussed in relation to the regional effects of climate change and the sensitivity of boreal lakes to subtle changes in the 'centre of action' of the NAO.

This study focuses on the spatiotemporal dynamics of cyanobacteria in the Zit-Emba reservoir, as well as the role of environmental variables. From March 2015 to February 2016, sampling was conducted at four sampling points (S1-S4). The co-occurrence of two bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis and Woronichinia, as well as their rapid growth in autumn (9 x 104 cells.mL-1 and 8 x 104 cells.mL-1, respectively), was an unexpected phenomenon. Woronichinia is a little-studied cyanobacterium, with most reports coming from Europe and North America. During the monitoring period, microcystin levels ranged from 0.04-5.74 mu g.L-1, with peaks observed during the cyanobacteria bloom. The PCA and correlation results revealed that water temperature and nutrient loading, particularly P-PO4 (max = 0.4 mg.L-1), were the most important contributing variables. This study emphasizes the importance of regularly monitoring cyanobacteria and their toxins, as well as implementing watershed management to reduce nutrient inputs in freshwater sources used for drinking water supplies.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				APR	2025	80	4					1059	1068		10.1007/s11756-025-01889-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-025-01889-5		MAR 2025											WOS:001435602100001

Some studies proposed to use random sets for modeling the spatial uncertainty of image objects with uncertain boundaries, but none have considered the parameter determination problem for large datasets. In this paper we refined the random set models for monitoring monthly changes in wetland vegetation areas from series of images. Twelve cloud-free HJ-1A/1B images from April 2009 to March 2010 were used for monitoring spatial-temporal changes of Poyang Lake wetlands. We applied random sets to represent spatial uncertainty of wetland vegetation that were extracted from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps. Time series of random sets reflect the seasonal differences of location and extents of the wetlands, whereas degree of uncertainties indicated by SD and CV indices reflect the gradual change of the wetland vegetation in space. Results show that the uncertain extents of wetland vegetation change through the year, achieving the largest range and uncertainty degree in autumn. This coincides with the highly heterogeneous vegetation status in autumn, since the wetland recovers gradually after flooding and young vegetation emerges at gradually changing densities, thus providing forage in different ecological zones for different types of migratory birds. We conclude that the random set model enriches spatial-temporal modeling of phenomena which are uncertain in space and dynamic in time. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzes the characteristics of delta D and delta O-18 isotopes of 160 groups of water bodies in the BJD area, an isotopic buildup model is constructed to classify the hydrologic partition of the lakes by estimating the ratio between lake evaporation (E) and discharge (I), and the maintenance mechanism of the lake group indicated by E/I is discussed. The results show that the lake group primarily relies on groundwater recharge and direct recharge of a small amount of local rainwater and the local rainwater is not the main source of groundwater recharge. The mean E/I values of delta D and delta O-18 calculated for 30 lakes in the BJD ranged from 0.74 to 1.33 (mean 1.05), indicating that the lake group largely maintained total recharge and evaporation at the same level; however, lake group have a tendency for terminal lakes to evolve into desiccating lakes. The primary reasons for the constant E/I of approximately 1 and the stability of lake group are: (1) stable groundwater recharge ensures the stability of total recharge and (2) small interannual changes in temperature, relative humidity, and the salinity effect ensure the stability of the annual evaporation of salt lakes. E/I of Badandong Lake to estimate the amount of water discharged by its seasonal drainage channels in winter and spring is approximately 10,649.16 m(3)/a. The outflow water discharges salt, which is the main reason the lake maintains a brackish water state. This study provides a reference for future research on the water cycle mechanism of lakes in arid regions.

Observing a Catastrophic Thermokarst Lake Drainage in Northern Alaska	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												The formation and drainage of thermokarst lakes have reshaped ice-rich permafrost lowlands in the Arctic throughout the Holocene. North of Teshekpuk Lake, on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, thermokarst lakes presently occupy 22.5% of the landscape, and drained thermokarst lake basins occupy 61.8%. Analysis of remotely sensed imagery indicates that nine lakes (>10 ha) have drained in the 1,750 km(2) study area between 1955 and 2014. The most recent lake drainage was observed using in situ data loggers providing information on the duration and magnitude of the event, and a nearby weather station provided information on the environmental conditions preceding the lake drainage. Lake 195 (L195), an 80 ha thermokarst lake with an estimated water volume of 872,000 m(3), catastrophically drained on 05 July 2014. Abundant winter snowfall and heavy early summer precipitation resulted in elevated lake water levels that likely promoted bank overtopping, thermo-erosion along an ice-wedge network, and formation of a 9 m wide, 2 m deep, and 70 m long drainage gully. The lake emptied in 36 hours, with 75% of the water volume loss occurring in the first ten hours. The observed peak discharge of the resultant flood was 25 m(3)/s, which is similar to that in northern Alaska river basins whose areas are more than two orders of magnitude larger. Our findings support the catastrophic nature of sudden lake drainage events and the mechanistic hypotheses developed by J. Ross Mackay. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Within this climatic scenario, a limnological study was carried out at Lake Limnopolar during three consecutive summer seasons (2001/2002, 2002/2003 and 2003/2004). The year-to-year meteorological variation observed during this period resulted in marked differences in the timing and duration of the ice-free period. As a result, physical and chemical conditions changed and were followed by variations in the biological characteristics of the lake. More significant dissimilarities took place during summer 2003/2004 relative to the preceding years. This season was characterized by a delay of 55 or 25 days in the ice-out timing compared to 2001/2002 or 2002/2003, respectively, and also a much shorter ice-free period. Higher algal and bacterial abundances in the surface layers occurred at the onset of ice melting due to increases in nutrients and light availability. The trophic interactions could also be affected by ice-out timing, as a consequence of the prolongation of the ice-cover period. From our findings, we describe links between the meteorological variations during those 3 years and the shifts in the water bodies, pointing out their high sensitivity to environmental changes that may occur at different time-scales. Furthermore, our results emphasize how the interannual meteorological variability needs to be investigated as a triggering factor of the limnological variations to understand the effects of global change on limnetic ecosystems in Maritime Antarctica.

J	CASE, TJ				CASE, TJ			BODY SIZE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF CHUCKWALLA, SAUROMALUS-OBESUS	ECOLOGY												Body size of chuckwallas, S. obesus (measured as the upper decile snout-vent length, UDL) at 12 locations throughout the species'' range [SW USA and Mexico] is highly correlated with average winter rainfall. The coefficient of rainfall variation and average seasonal temperatures did not significantly aid winter rainfall in accounting for populational body size differences. Two populations with the highest (Little Lake) and the next to lowest (Amboy) UDL were studied in detail. The larger Little Lake chuckwallas appear to grow faster but do not live longer than chuckwallas at Amboy. This enhanced growth was allied to the more diverse and abundant food regime at Little Lake. Chuckwallas at Little Lake maintain relatively smaller fat bodies than animals at Amboy. This may be an adaptation to Amboy''s more severe and less productive environment.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1976	57	2					313	323		10.2307/1934819	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1934819													WOS:A1976BU06400009

The lake experienced complete mixing in 2008 due to a series of orkan winds, and since 2015, intensifying worsening of water quality in the lake has been observed. Our aim was to determine the degree of transformation of Lubiskie Lake based on water chemistry and to identify the source of pollution of the lake using strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) as a new chemical tracking tool. The physicochemical analysis confirmed the meromictic character of the lake. The comparison with previous studies (2003 and 2008) showed significant year-to-year differentiation, indicating intensifying eutrophication of the lake's water, both in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. Nine spring niches, directly supplying the lake, provide water with very high phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations (up to 10 kg of nitrogen and 0.9 kg of phosphorus daily). The strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) analysis indicated that the lake's water was supplied mostly by the springs, and recharge from deep aquifers is of secondary importance. Moreover, strontium isotope data and the relationship between Sr and Cl content support the finding that the high load of nutrients is of anthropogenic origin and reaches the lake through springs.

These perspectives are especially important for water-stressed regions such as the western United States. One such region is northwestern California (CA), where Holocene-length hydroclimatic records are scarce. Here, we present a 9000-year, relative lake level record from Maddox Lake (CA) using a multi-indicator approach. The Early Holocene is characterized by variably low lake levels with a brief excursion to wetter climates/relative highstand ca. 8.4-8.06 cal ka BP, possibly related to the 8.2 ka cold event and changing Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). From 5.2-0.55 cal ka BP, Maddox Lake experienced a long-term regression, tracking changes in summer-winter insolation, tropical and northeast Pacific SSTs, and the southward migration of the ITCZ. This gradual regression culminated in a pronounced relative lowstand during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA). A marked relative highstand followed the MCA, correlative to the Little Ice Age. The latter reflects a far-field response to North Atlantic volcanism, solar variability, and possibly changes in AMOC and Arctic sea ice extent. Our results further confirm the hydroclimatic sensitivity of northwest California to various forcings including those emanating from the North Atlantic.					; Ramezan, Reza/NRY-0794-2025	kirby, matthew/0000-0001-7534-2927; , Cody Poulsen/0009-0001-7680-6620; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	2023	115						90	108	PII S0033589423000182	10.1017/qua.2023.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2023.18		MAY 2023											WOS:000984180300001
J	Hunsaker, CT; Johnson, DW				Hunsaker, Carolyn T.; Johnson, Dale W.			Concentration-discharge relationships in headwater streams of the Sierra Nevada, California	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We examined stream water concentration-discharge relationships for eight small, forest watersheds ranging in elevation from 1485 to 2465 m in the southern Sierra Nevada. These headwater streams revealed nearly chemostatic behavior by current definitions for K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, and SO42 in most cases but not for NH4+, NO3, or ortho-P. The latter ions were somewhat enriched during high flows. All ions studied showed a dilution process at lower flows (< 50 L s(-1)) with the concentration-discharge relationship being more chemostatic at higher flows. While previous studies in the Sierra Nevada have reported peak concentrations of NH4+, NO3, and SO42 during snowmelt, the headwater systems of the Kings River Experimental Watersheds experience peak concentrations of these ions during the fall rains after the dry summer. These forested watersheds span the rain-snow transition zone, are 49-228 ha in size, and have soils derived from granite. A statistically significant relationship between soils and stream water concentrations for ortho-P, Ca2+, and Na+ strongly suggests that soil chemistry has a major influence on stream water chemistry. Factors controlling stream water NH4+, NO3, and SO4+ concentrations are less clear, but one possible source of spikes in these ions during storm events is input from O-horizon runoff where high concentrations were measured. Overall, stream water concentration-discharge relationships for these Sierran watersheds are similar to those found in other watershed systems (nearly chemostatic); however, the dominant processes controlling these relationships are probably localized because of different watershed characteristics like soil chemistry, vegetation cover, hydrologic flow paths, and weather patterns.

Differences in phytoplankton assemblages have been detected both in space and time. In eutrophic lakes coccoid Chlorophyceae dominated quantitatively during September and October. Diatoms were the most diverse group in all types of lakes in September and in meso- and oligotrophic lakes in October. Ln November Cryptophyceae became the most abundant group in all lakes. The total richness of species decreased in the meso- and oligotrophic environments in November compared to September and October, whilst in the eutrophic environment it remained almost unchanged. Cluster analyses, using both presence-absence and presence-absence in combination with abundance matrices, showed similar results and a good resolution between the lakes of different eutrophication conditions. We conclude that the phytoplankton assemblages of the lakes studied depended on the trophic conditions and thus they can be used for resolution between different euhophication levels.																			0107-055X						2000	20	2					225	232		10.1111/j.1756-1051.2000.tb01575.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2000.tb01575.x													WOS:000088099900014
J	Santofimia, E; López-Pamo, E				Santofimia, E.; Lopez-Pamo, E.			The role of surface water and mine groundwater in the chemical stratification of an acidic pit lake (Iberian Pyrite Belt, Spain)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydraulic system of the Concepcion mine is made up of an open pit and an underground mine, which are currently flooded and hydraulically connected. The Concepcion pit lake has shown permanent chemical stratification (meromictic lake), where two layers with different density and chemical composition can be differentiated: (i) a thick superficial layer of 11 +/- 2 m deep, with a low concentration of dissolved solids (mixolimnion) and (ii) a thin bottom layer from 11 +/- 2 m to 16 m deep (monimolimnion), exhibiting vertical changes in its physico-chemical parameters, with decreasing redox potential and increasing T, pH and dissolved solids content with depth. The distribution of the Concepcion pit lake layers depends on recharge processes and the loss of water from the system. In winter, rainfall and runoff result in a rapid increase of lake levels. The lake regains its initial level whenever water is lost through an old mine adit, since galleries and shafts act as preferential pathways for inflowing and outflowing water. This network is connected to the bottom of the lake, resulting in the progressive downward movement of the chemocline. Furthermore, runoff generates a less dense superficial layer, which triggers the development of an ephemeral chemocline in the mixolimnion. In summer, the mixolimnion loses water by evaporation which is partially compensated by groundwater inflowing from the lake bottom, resulting in the upward movement of the permanent chemocline. During this period the water level in the system is below the outlet level, which therefore renders the outflow of water inactive. During this stage, the mixolimnion remains homogeneous and the shallow chemocline disappears. Taking into consideration the hydro-chemical characteristics of this pit lake and the spatial distribution of the layers identified, a model that explains its seasonal limnological evolution is presented.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the sharp fluctuations in water levels for these lakes in this region are still unclear. The water level fluctuations in geological time can provide an analogue to better understand current lake levels' response to global warming. In this study, a combination of quartz and feldspar luminescence dating techniques was applied to establish the chronologies of two sedimentary sequences related to lake level in the catchment of Daihai Lake, located on the fringe of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) domain. Our objective is to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of lake level fluctuations and provide the interpretations of their causes. The results indicate that two lakelevel highstands existed during 130-120 ka and 8-4 ka, at least similar to 38 m and 40 m above the current lake level, respectively. We interpret that the lake level variations on multiple timescales in the monsoonal marginal area have primarily been regulated by the EASM intensity and corresponding monsoonal precipitation, while temperature changes may have played a minor role. Moreover, a compilation of existing lake level data reveals that EASM intensity has a complex response to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation on millennial-orbital timescales. Combining precipitation records in central and southern China, the character of rainfall across East Asia during MIS 5 exhibits a dominant tripolar pattern. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, JM; Liao, JJ				Chen, Jiaming; Liao, Jingjuan			Monitoring lake level changes in China using multi-altimeter data (2016-2019)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Changes in lake levels are an important indicator of water balance and climate change. However, it is not feasible to perform continuous in situ measurements for a large number of lakes in China. Satellite altimetry has been used successfully to monitor water levels of inland lakes in recent years. In this study, through waveform retracking, lake level estimation, lake level time series construction, multi-altimeter time series fusion and outlier detection, changes in water level of 340 lakes (> 10 km(2)) in China between 2016 and 2019 were monitored using multi-altimeter data from Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A. Overall, the water levels of these lakes showed a mean increasing trend of 0.343 m/yr. The water levels of 274 lakes have a mean increasing trend of 0.465 m/yr and those of 66 showed a mean decreasing trend of -0.164 m/yr. The annual rate of change of lake water levels increased from south to north and decreased from west to east in terms of spatial distribution. The changes in lake level varied among different basins owing to their high spatial heterogeneity: most lakes in the Songhua and Liao River Basin and Yellow River Basin showed an increasing trend; all lakes in the Huai River Basin were relatively steady; 14 of 19 lakes in the Yangtze River Basin showed a decreasing trend; the great majority of lakes in the Inland River Basin showed an increasing trend; and the lakes located in the southeastern Qiangtang Basin, near the Nyainqen Tanglha Mountain, showed a decreasing trend. In addition, some lakes in the western Qiangtang Basin also showed a decreasing trend. Factor analysis indicated that the factors driving changes in lake level varied among different areas. However, temperature changes in autumn and winter were significantly correlated with changes in lake level.					; Chen, JiaMing/JGM-6996-2023; Liao, Jiajun/AAL-3864-2021	Chen, Jiaming/0000-0001-9457-5259; liao, jing juan/0000-0002-5915-2661; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2020	590								125544	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125544													WOS:000599754500241

C. staphylinus is one of the most numerous species of harpacticoids in the lake. It can dwell in almost all littoral biotopes. In profundal biotopes strongly exposed to anthropogenic influence (pollution and eutrophication) only this species of harpacticoid was found. A peculiarity of C. staphylinus biology is that in summer individuals are in the resting stage as cysts. In summer active individuals were found in littoral habitats at a water temperature of 20 degrees C, but their number was small in comparison with cold periods of the year. In the littoral zone the relative number of individuals in cysts was clearly related to water temperature. Twelve degrees temperature appears to be critical for development of littoral populations of C. staphylinus.

J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, Kenneth H.			Introduction to the biology and ecology of the freshwater cryophilic dinoflagellate Woloszynskia pascheri causing red ice	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The rarely reported red pigmented dinoflagellate, Woloszynskia pascheri, is described from frozen surface waters in Ontario, Canada. New information based on light microscopy (LM) is provided on cell organelles (dinokaryon, chromosomes, pigment droplets and ectoplasmic vesicular layer), the thin-walled ice-bound pellicle cysts and thick-walled summer resting cysts. An earlier published suggestion that W. pascheri has morphology similar to that of Gymnodinium cryophilum (Wedemayer, Wilcox et Graham) G. Hansen et Moestrup is refuted. The process of red ice formation depends on a number of weather-related and other environmental factors. The most important of these being a mid-winter thaw that creates pathways (cracks and melted areas of ice) for passage of swimming cells from the water underlying the ice to water on the surface of the ice. In thin-walled ice-bound pellicle cysts, W. pascheri remained viable at ambient air temperatures lower than -20A degrees C for several days and suggests a unique biochemical physiology that needs research. A summary of the historical classification of this species reveals a tumultuous past and the continuing assignment of this species within the genus Woloszynskia appears doubtful, given the rapidly improving state of knowledge about the fine structure and molecular biology of many other similar species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	784	1					305	319		10.1007/s10750-016-2885-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2885-5													WOS:000387484100022

The method is applied to a high-resolution lake sediment core retrieved from Southern Norway, resulting in a detailed record of Holocene river-flood activity covering the last 10,000 years, including floods also recorded by instrumental and historical data. The minimum number of individual floods recorded for this period is similar to 100. On multidecadal to centennial timescales significant change in flood frequency is observed that arguably can be attributed to large-scale climatic changes such as the varying amount of winter precipitation and summer rainstorms. Flood frequency was low during the early Holocene (9770-7700 cal yr BP), and even lower for the period that followed, lasting until 5500 cal yr BP For the next 2500 years, a modest increase in flood activity followed. This trend was truncated 2500 cal yr BP by a sudden shift towards increased flooding frequency. With the exception of a short interval around 1000 cal yr BP, when the number of floods again was low, this tendency of increased flood activity prevailed until present; including "Stor-Ofsen", a large flood that occurred in AD 1789, and also three other historically documented river floods.

Nutrient loading as a key cause of short- and long-term anthropogenic ecological degradation of the Salton Sea	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Salton Sea (SS), California's largest inland lake at 816 square kilometers, formed in 1905 from a levee breach in an area historically characterized by natural wet-dry cycles as Lake Cahuilla. Despite more than a century of untreated agricultural drainage inputs, there has not been a systematic assessment of nutrient loading, cycling, and associated ecological impacts at this iconic waterbody. The lake is now experiencing unprecedented degradation, particularly following the 2003 Quantification Settlement Agreement-the largest agricultural-to-urban water transfer in the United States. Combined with high evaporation rates, reduced inflows have led to rapid lake shrinkage, with current maximum depths of only 10 m. Here we report distinct temporal and spatial patterns for nutrient dynamics at the SS for two decades spanning the period before and after major water transfer agreement. While external nutrient loading remains relatively consistent year-round, internal cycling varies seasonally. Winter exhibits high total phosphates and nitrate levels due to reduced primary productivity, with lower ammonium concentrations from increased oxygenation. Summer conditions shift to decreased phosphate and nitrate levels from enhanced primary production, sustained partly by internal phosphorus release from sediments during anoxic periods. Although N:P molar ratios can exceed 50:1 to 100:1 (far above the Redfield ratio of 16:1), phosphorus consistently remains at hypereutrophic levels (> 0.05 mg/L) challenging previous assumptions of phosphorus limitation. Post-2020 data show disrupted stratification patterns. Despite higher oxygen levels in bottom waters compared to 2004-2009, overall water column oxygenation has declined, reflecting altered hydrodynamics in the shallowing lake. These changes have intensified environmental challenges stemming from cultural eutrophication including harmful algal blooms, threatening both ecosystem and public health. Effective remediation will require significant reduction in external nutrient loading through constructed wetlands and/or treatment facilities at tributary mouths to reduce the lake's overall nutrient inventory over time.

J	Bastidas-Navarro, M; Modenutti, B				Bastidas-Navarro, Marcela; Modenutti, Beatriz			Effect of macrophytes and food resources on the horizontal distribution of testate amoebae and rotifers in an Andean-Patagonian lake	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												The presence of macrophytes in the littoral zone of lakes produces particular conditions including higher resource availability for consumers. For this reason, the littoral zone is generally the area with the highest diversity of lakes and rivers. In this work we studied the horizontal distribution of testate amoebae and rotifers in Lago Escondido (Argentina) in relation to food resources availability. The study was carried out along a north-south transect that includes the littoral and the pelagic zone of the lake. Phytoplankton and zooplankton were sampled during summer and spring (2001-2003) in five sampling stations: one pelagic and four littoral. Rotifers and testate amoebae, as well as phytoplanktonic algae abundance and biomass were estimated. Food resources were classified as nanoplankton (< 20 mu m) and net phytoplankton (> 20 mu m) and the biovolume of these fractions varied significantly within the pelagic and littoral zones of the lake. Nanoplankon dominated the pelagic zone and was mainly composed by nanoflagellates while net phytoplankton prevailed in the littoral zone and was composed by diatoms, cyanophytes and chlorophytes. The highest number of species and diversity of testate amoebae and rotifers were observed in the littoral stations; nevertheless, no significant differences between the zones colonized by different macrophytes were observed. The CCA analysis showed four different groups. Keratella cochlearis, Synchaeta spp., Polyarthra vulgaris and Collotheca mutabilis characterized the pelagic samples and were related with a high abundance of nanoplankton. On the other hand, rotifers like Trichocerca spp., Lecane spp. and Euchlanis spp. and the testate amoebae Difflugia pyriformis and Trinema enchelys associated with the littoral samples were related with high abundances of net phytoplankton. Besides, a third group of species (Lecane spp. and Arcella spp.), presented in both zones, was mainly related with a decrease in abundance of net phytoplankton. Finally, the rotifer Synchaeta spp. was associated with the spring pelagic samples when the cyanophyte Coelosphaerium kuetzingianum increased its abundance. Summarizing, in Lago Escondido, food resources could be an important factor driving testate amoeba and rotifer distribution. Therefore the major role of macrophytes for this small-bodied zooplankton is food supply through an increment of net phytoplankton.

Total DDT concentrations ranged 2.36-22.4 ng/L, 0.72-21.9 ng/L, 2.25-33.7 ng/L, and 4.42-7.29 ng/g in surface water, overlying water, pore water, and sediments, respectively, which were at the intermediate levels compared to those of other area around the world. Seasonal variations of DDTs were featured by higher concentration in summer. This was likely associated with (a) the increase of land runoff in the summer and (b) application of dicofol and DDT-containing antifouling paints for ships in summer. Sediment-water fugacity ratios of the DDT isomers were used to predict the direction of the sediment-water exchange of these isomers. The sediment-surface water, sediment-overlying water, and sediment-pore water fugacity ratios of DDT isomers averaged 0.34, 0.44, and 0.1, which are significantly lower than the equilibrium status (1.0), suggesting that the net flux direction were from the water to sediment and the sediment acted as a sink for the DDTs. The difference of DDT concentrations between sediment and water samples was found to be an important factor affecting the diffusion of DDT from the water to sediment.					; Gong, Wenwen/Q-9161-2016; Liu, Xinhui/AAN-4751-2020; liang, gang/ACU-9853-2022	Gong, Wenwen/0000-0003-1271-4150; Liu, Xinhui/0000-0002-8171-9214; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2014	21	6					4516	4526		10.1007/s11356-013-2400-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2400-8								24337993					WOS:000332795700046

New strains of an aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Porphyrobacter donghaensis isolated from a Siberian thermal spring and a weakly mineralized lake	MICROBIOLOGY												A strain of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPB) isolated from the surface of a cyanobacterial mat of an Eastern Siberian thermal spring (40A degrees C) and designated Se-4 was identified as Porphyrobacter donghaensis according to its 16S rRNA gene sequence. A DNA-DNA hybridization level of 95% was determined between strain Se-4 and the type strain of this species, SW-132(T). The isolate was an obligate aerobe, forming orange round colonies on solid media, which turn red in the course of growth. The cells were motile rods capable of branching. The cells divided by uniform fission by constriction. Optimal growth was observed at pH 7.5 and NaCl concentrations from 0 to 1 g/L. The pigments present were carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll a. Another Porphyrobacter donghaensis strain, Noj-1, isolated from a purple mat developing on the surface of a coastal set-up in a steppe weakly mineralized (1.5 g/L) soda lake Nozhii (Eastern Siberia) possessed similar characteristics. Thus, the AAPB species Porphyrobacter donghaensis was shown to occur, apart from marine environments (its known habitat), also in weakly mineralized soda lakes and freshwater thermal springs. Description of the species Porphyrobacter donghaensis was amended.

J	Wang, Q; Yang, XD; Song, B				Wang, Qian; Yang, Xiangdong; Song, Bing			Patterns of last-deglacial diatom-inferred summer temperature variability and ecological thresholds in the alpine lakes from southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is a significant component of global climate and plays a key role in transporting heat and moisture from tropical oceans to the Indian subcontinent. The ISM has a critical role in ecosystem functioning as well as the development of regional agriculture and societies. However, it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which these two drivers interact and impact regional biogeochemistry from contemporary process studies because of the widespread human footprint, and millennial-scale ISM dynamics remain poorly understood over the last 20,000 years. Here we used high-resolution diatoms from alpine lakes at different elevations in the southwest monsoon region to reconstruct summer temperature and environmental variability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). By comparing with other proxy-based temperature reconstructions of the Tibetan Plateau and the monsoon proxy records from South Asia, we found a 3-6 degrees C warming trend and ISM strengthening since the LGM. Our results indicate that summer temperature began to increase since 17.5 cal. kyr BP, marking the onset of deglacial warming. During the early to middle Holocene, the climate clearly warmed and then decreased afterward. The maximum warm interval occurred during the mid-Holocene, which followed changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Additionally, examinations of fossil diatom assemblages revealed that changes in compositions were closely linked with global and Indian monsoon climate changes on glacial and interglacial time scales. The abrupt temperature increases from extreme cold to warm transition during the Late-glacial/Holocene boundary (similar to 3 degrees C) are strongly associated with regional replacement of major biotic species compositions. The presence of biotic transition and the increased rate of temperature increase during the Late-glacial/Holocene transition confirm the importance of climate change in restructuring biological communities. This suggests that biotic structures necessary to survive such rapid climate regime were susceptible to impacts of the speed and magnitude of temperature change in monsoon region.																			0921-8181	1872-6364				OCT	2023	229								104235	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104235		SEP 2023											WOS:001077785100001

Ice cover extent drives phytoplankton and bacterial community structure in a large north-temperate lake: implications for a warming climate	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Mid-winter limnological surveys of Lake Erie captured extremes in ice extent ranging from expansive ice cover in 2010 and 2011 to nearly ice-free waters in 2012. Consistent with a warming climate, ice cover on the Great Lakes is in decline, thus the ice-free condition encountered may foreshadow the lakes future winter state. Here, we show that pronounced changes in annual ice cover are accompanied by equally important shifts in phytoplankton and bacterial community structure. Expansive ice cover supported phytoplankton blooms of filamentous diatoms. By comparison, ice free conditions promoted the growth of smaller sized cells that attained lower total biomass. We propose that isothermal mixing and elevated turbidity in the absence of ice cover resulted in light limitation of the phytoplankton during winter. Additional insights into microbial community dynamics were gleaned from short 16S rRNA tag (Itag) Illumina sequencing. UniFrac analysis of Itag sequences showed clear separation of microbial communities related to presence or absence of ice cover. Whereas the ecological implications of the changing bacterial community are unclear at this time, it is likely that the observed shift from a phytoplankton community dominated by filamentous diatoms to smaller cells will have far reaching ecosystem effects including food web disruptions.

The lake supported by a karstic spring located near the Adriatic seashore is inhabited by unusually rich brackish water truncatelloid assemblage. The position of the lake near seashore evokes a model of sea invertebrate gradual adaptation to freshwater spring head allowing them to further invade the stygobiont karst conduits. Similar lakes could be the marine gateways of the extraordinarily rich Dinaric stygobiont fauna. The main aim of this study was to sample and barcode the aquatic snails found in this locality to check their species affiliation and describe conservation needs. The results confirmed that the locality hosts four interesting representatives of the gastropod superfamily Truncatelloidea, which has never been found syntopically so far. One of the species characterized by unique COI sequences and was described herein as Truncatella dalmatica new sp. The conservation need of this unique and understudied habitat type is discussed.

Malacofauna of the littoral benthos of a saline lake in southern Mendoza, Argentina	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The Banado Carilauquen (BC) is part of the "Laguna Llancanelo" Watershed, an area of international relevance for biodiversity conservation that holds interest for oil production. Records on the biological attributes of the systems waters are scarce, particularly regarding benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. The goal wits to study the diversity of malacofauna in the BC and the relationship between its distribution patterns and water physicochemical parameters. Biological samplings and records of environmental parameters were carried out between summer of 2000 and spring of 2001 for live reaches of the BC. Complete individuals and empty shells of each species were recorded for every sample, and height and width were measured for all shells. Conchological relationships were estimated and sizes compared. The relationship between presence and abundance of molluscs and environmental parameters was explored using CCA. Five gastropod species were identified: Heleobia parchappii, H.hatcheri, Chilina mendozana, Lymnaea viator and Biomphalaria peregrina. A growing gradient of conductivity and hardness was detected between the headwaters (relatively soft waters) and the outlet-lake (very hard and saline Waters). The distribution of molluscs is related to this gradient. Our results Suggest that, except for the headwaters, the BC is hardly favourable for the development of gastropod populations. This was expressed in low species diversity. low densities, reduced sizes, fluctuating populations and high proportion of empty shells (> 80%).																			1863-9135						2008	172	2					87	98		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0087													WOS:000259369800001

Design and Construction of an Urban Runoff Research Facility	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												As the urban population increases, so does the area of irrigated urban landscape. Summer water use in urban areas can be 2-3x winter base line water use due to increased demand for landscape irrigation. Improper irrigation practices and large rainfall events can result in runoff from urban landscapes which has potential to carry nutrients and sediments into local streams and lakes where they may contribute to eutrophication. A 1,000 m(2) facility was constructed which consists of 24 individual 33.6 m(2) field plots, each equipped for measuring total runoff volumes with time and collection of runoff subsamples at selected intervals for quantification of chemical constituents in the runoff water from simulated urban landscapes. Runoff volumes from the first and second trials had coefficient of variability (CV) values of 38.2 and 28.7%, respectively. CV values for runoff pH, EC, and Na concentration for both trials were all under 10%. Concentrations of DOC, TDN, DON, PO4-P, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ had CV values less than 50% in both trials. Overall, the results of testing performed after sod installation at the facility indicated good uniformity between plots for runoff volumes and chemical constituents. The large plot size is sufficient to include much of the natural variability and therefore provides better simulation of urban landscape ecosystems.					, Kevin/AAH-4525-2020														1940-087X					AUG	2014		90							e51540	10.3791/51540	http://dx.doi.org/10.3791/51540								25146420					WOS:000349299200021

This study applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the diversity of microorganism and pathogenic bacteria in source water in Tai Lake, China in winter. The physico-chemical characteristics of water were measured. Then the DNA of the samples was extracted and amplified by PCR. The PCR products were performed for pyrosequencing on a Miseq PE300 pyro sequencing platform. The result of 16s rDNA was anlayzed using the visualization software Gephi and the 16s rDNA gene pool of the known pathogenic bacteria was established. A total of 144,29216S rDNA gene sequences with average length of 395.66bps were obtained. These sequences revealed 580 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The full length 16S rDNA gene database of common pathogenic bacteria was established. After blasting, 17 species of pathogenic bacteria were found. The most abundant potential human pathogenic bacteria were affiliated with B. tribocorum. The approaches used in this study could simultaneously detect most of the known potentially pathogenic bacteria in source water. The relationship between the microorganisms and source water in different periods would help us understand the diversity of microorganisms in source water in winter.

J	KERLINGER, P				KERLINGER, P			FLIGHT BEHAVIOR OF SHARP-SHINNED HAWKS DURING MIGRATION .2. OVER WATER	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												The behavior of sharp-shined hawks (Accipiter striatus) confronted by water barriers was examined during fall migration at Cape May Point, New Jersey (Delaware Bay) [USA], and during spring migration at Whitefish Point, Michigan (Lake Superior) [USA]. Both study sites were at the end of long peninsulas where hawks must either cross approximately 18-24 km of water or fly hundreds of kilometers around the water barriers. Sharp-shinned hawks readily crossed at both sites when winds lateral (perpendicular) to crossing directions were light, but rarely when winds were strong, suggesting that they preferred to cross when the potential for being blown off course was minimal. A greater proportion of hawks also crossed when flight at the shoreline was at high as opposed to low altitudes, and when land on the opposite side of the water barrier was visible. At Cape May, hawks compensated for lateral winds of up to 6 m/s during flights over water, although very few birds attempted to cross when lateral winds exceeded 5 m/s. At Whitefish, hawks compensated only partially for lateral winds. The difference in realized flight direction between sites was attributable to differing topographies, not to a difference in the hawks'' ability to compensate for lateral wind. There may be a threshold for drift at lateral winds between 5 and 8 m/s for sharp-shinned hawks using powered flight over water.																			0003-3472	1095-8282					1984	32	NOV					1029	1034		10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80217-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80217-1													WOS:A1984TU79000010

However, the measurements of chemical and isotopic compositions of Archean sedimentary rocks does not provide sufficient information for understanding the biogeochemical processes that characterized oceans during this period. In this research, the cycling of the redox-sensitive elements in the water column and sediments of the seasonally stratified Lake Sihailongwan, China, was studied. It was found that during the stratification, the concentrations of sulfate ions in the epilimnion were <100 mu mol L-1. The hypolimnion of the lake becomes anoxic and contains iron, manganese and low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide. These conditions are similar to those suggested to exist in the Archean ocean, and therefore the biogeochemical cycles in Lake Sihailongwan may be analogous to those in the Archean ocean. In Lake Sihailongwan, the chemocline is always deeper than the thermocline. The hypolimnion is supersaturated with respect to iron sulfide in August, while in May and October, this supersaturation is present only in the lower hypolimnion. The concentration profiles of the redox species in the water column and in the sediments show that dissolved iron(II) and manganese(II) diffuse from the sediments into the water column, while hydrogen sulfide and sulfate diffuse into the sediment. At the hypolimnion, the sulfur isotope fractionation values are consistent with microbial sulfate reduction, possibly combined, to a minor extent, with disproportionation of zero-valent sulfur. The absolute sulfur isotope fractionation factor increases between spring and autumn and decreases with water depth, possibly due to precipitation of iron sulfide in the lower hypolimnion. The fraction of highly reactive iron in the sediments is mainly composed of iron(II) carbonates and the most reactive iron(III) (hydr)oxide phases. Iron-based redox proxies are consistent with sediment deposition under ferruginous water column conditions. In the sediment, concentrations of sulfate and hydrogen sulfide are low, and sulfur isotope composition of sedimentary pyrite is equal to that of the epilimnetic sulfate. The obtained results demonstrated that despite a low sulfate concentration in the water column, sulfur isotope fractionation is high. However, due to the complete consumption of the sulfate reservoir, the large isotope fractionation is not preserved in the sedimentary record. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomass, production and life history of Mysis relicta were studied in the large Lake Mjosa during the years 1976-80. Biomass fluctuations were large, but biomass averaged about 1 g wet wt m-2 or 200 ind. m-2. Cumulative net production during summer ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 g wet wt m-2. Mean population P/B-ratio was close to 2. 2. Neither production or biomass of Mysis were correlated with the biomass of phytoplankton or the main zooplankton prey species (Daphnia and Bosmina), suggesting a predominant 'top down' control of Mysis in this lake. 3. The life cycle was well synchronized with development of food items, but predation pressure also affected life-history patterns. The proportion of juveniles apparently increased in years with strong fish predation pressure, producing a predominantly 1-year life-cycle pattern the following year. 4. Mysis had a predominant 2-year life history, but a fraction of the population may reproduce after 1 or 3 years. Reproduction occurred exclusively during winter. Even in such a large and stable system, where Mysis has coexisted with its main food items and predators for 8-10 000 years, a flexible life history is maintained and is probably an important buffer against year-to-year fluctuations in food and predator abundance.

The area of glacial lakes has expanded from 9.24 +/- 0.1 km(2) in the 1970s to 10.96 +/- 0.1 km(2) in 2009. Specifically, the area of moraine-dammed lakes has increased by 26.8%. From the 1970s to 2009, the glacierized area in the Boshula mountain range shrank by 12.7% (21.2 km(2)). Increasing mean summer air temperature was the main cause for the glacier recession and lake expansion from the 1970s to 2001, while the combination of increased summer temperature and decreased summer precipitation led to accelerated glacier recession after 2001. Climate warming and ongoing deglaciation play important roles in the expansion of moraine-dammed lakes, calling for intensified monitoring to properly address the hazard potential in the study area.					; Wang, Weicai/GYA-1422-2022	Wang, Weicai/0000-0003-1352-6303; 													0260-3055	1727-5644					2011	52	58					9	17		10.3189/172756411797252347	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756411797252347													WOS:000293680600002

A cross-section from the Boldakov River to Maloye More strait characterized by great depths was chosen for the study. Numerical experiments showed that under low levels of river mineralization, downwelling in the thermal bar front played a key role in water mixing. Under high levels of mineralization, the crucial factor was the large-scale near-slope circulation appearing when the stable temperature stratification of deep waters was broken. The haline characteristics of river inflow influenced the time of thermal bar appearance and the speed of propagation in the open lake. Moreover, it was shown that eddy structures can form on both sides of the thermal bar only under minor differences between river and lake mineralization levels.

J	HOHMAN, WL; RAVE, DP				HOHMAN, WL; RAVE, DP			DIURNAL TIME-ACTIVITY BUDGETS OF WINTERING CANVASBACKS IN LOUISIANA	WILSON BULLETIN												We determined diurnal time-activity budgets of Canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) at Catahoula Lake and at the Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana, from December 1987 to March 1988. Canvasback feeding, resting, locomotory, and comfort activities varied by month and location with a month-location interaction. Moreover, the percentage of time spent feeding varied by sex with a month-sex interaction. Study site differences in the time-activity budgets of wintering Canvasbacks may be related to characteristics of their foods, foraging mode, disturbance level, and physical features of habitats at the two study sites. Canvasbacks wintering in Louisiana generally spent less time feeding and more time resting during the day than they did in Mississippi or coastal South Carolina. Levels of agonistic behavior were lower than those observed in South Carolina. We found no evidence of male dominance of female Canvasbacks in Louisiana.																			0043-5643					DEC	1990	102	4					645	654																WOS:A1990ET65700008
J	Takata, H; Takayasu, K; Hasegawa, S				Takata, H; Takayasu, K; Hasegawa, S			Foraminifera in an organic-rich, brackish-water lagoon, Lake Saroma, Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												We investigated the distribution of benthic foraminifera in Lake Saroma, a large lagoon on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk in Hokkaido, Japan, to establish the characteristics of the foraminiferal fauna in these cool, organic-rich brackish-water environments. Three types of faunas were identified: a Lagoon-bottom fauna dominated by Haynesina sp. A, a Shallow-water fauna dominated by Trochammina cf. japonica, and a River-mouth fauna dominated by Elphidium excavatum. The distribution of species is controlled by the dissolved oxygen content of bottom water in the summer, and a combination of organic enrichment and high mud content in the substrate that is specific to areas off river mouths. Haynesina sp. A opportunistically adapts to organic-rich and oxygen-poor conditions in deeper basins in the lagoon during the summer, whereas Trochammina cf. japonica mostly occurs in shallower areas where summer oxygen levels are high enough to sustain reproduction. Elphidium excaratum probably adapts to organic-rich sediments specific to areas near river mouths.																			0096-1191					JAN	2006	36	1					44	60		10.2113/36.1.44	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/36.1.44													WOS:000235598600005

Depending on the interval considered, the lacustrine deposits are mainly composed of marls, carbonates or gypsiferous evaporites, showing lithological, mineralogical and geochemical features (i.e., magnesium, strontium and sulfur contents, celestine deposits and travertine growths) that are evidence of intense, tectonically-induced hydrothermal activity. According to the high concentrations of strontium and sulfur as well as the abundance of travertines and magnesium clays, the supply of hot waters was greater during the Zanclean, the Gelasian and the Calabrian, as a result of tectonic activity. Hydrothermal activity has continued until the present time and is responsible of the hot springs that are nowadays active in the Guadix Baza Depression. The paleoenvironmental consequences of these sublacustrine hot springs were that during some intervals the lakes maintained a relatively permanent water table, not subject to periodic desiccations in the dry season, and warmer temperatures throughout the year. This resulted in a high level of organic productivity, especially for the Calabrian, which allowed the development of a rich and well diversified mammalian community, similar to those of modern African savannas with tree patches. In this mild environment, the permanent water sheet favored the presence of drought intolerant megaherbivores such as the giant extinct hippo Hippopotamus antiquus. The high standing crop biomass of ungulates resulted in the availability of abundant carcasses for scavengers such as hyenas and hominins, which explains the very high densities of skeletal remains preserved in the sediments distributed along the lake surroundings.

Temperature sensitivity of branched and isoprenoid GDGTs in Arctic lakes	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Understanding the causes and potential ecological and environmental impacts of recent and future temperature changes in the Arctic requires a better understanding of long term climate variability. Amongst the most promising new geochemical tools for sedimentary paleotemperature reconstructions are those based on the glycerol diakyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs). Although a number of studies have recently developed empirical calibrations for the temperature sensitivity of isoprenoid GDGTs (i.e., the TEX86 index) and the branched GDGTs (i. e., the MBT/CBT index) in mid and low latitude lakes, there is very little data from lakes in the Arctic. Here, we examine the temperature and environmental controls on GDGT abundances in a transect of small lakes (n = 59) distributed across Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Isoprenoid and branched GDGTs are ubiquitous in these lakes. The temperature control on the isoprenoid GDGT distributions is weak, although there is a significant relationship between the branched GDGT distributions and warm season temperature. Furthermore, published relationships developed between branched GDGTs and mean annual air temperatures in tropical lakes yield reconstructed temperatures from Arctic lakes that are consistent with Arctic summer air temperature. This suggests that empirical calibrations from branched GDGTs in lakes reflect the seasonality of branched GDGT production. For example, at low latitudes there is little seasonality in temperature, and branched GDGT production records air temperatures throughout the year. In the Arctic however, branched GDGTs are likely produced in summer, when the temperatures are warmest, sunlight hours are greatest and ice cover is diminished. Due to the extreme seasonality and short window of Arctic productivity, the use of branched GDGTs for summer paleotemperature reconstructions likely remains robust back through time. However, interpretations of paleotemperatures from branched GDGTs in temperate lakes may require careful consideration about potential changes in the seasonal timing of branched GDGT production.

J	Selvaraj, K; Wei, KY; Liu, KK; Kao, SJ				Selvaraj, Kandasamy; Wei, Kuo-Yen; Liu, Kon-Kee; Kao, Shuh-Ji			Late Holocene monsoon climate of northeastern Taiwan inferred from elemental (C, N) and isotopic (δ13C, δ15N) data in lake sediments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Little information exists about centennial-scale climate variability on oceanic islands in the western Pacific where the East Asian monsoon (EAM) strongly influences the climate, mountain ecosystem and the society. In this study, we investigate a 168 cm long sediment core recovered from Emerald Peak Lake in subalpine NE Taiwan for the contents of grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), C/N ratio, and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to reconstruct the monsoon climate and vegetation density during the late Holocene. Six radiocarbon (C-14) ages obtained on plant remains used for the chronology indicate that the sediment core has been accumulated since similar to 3770 cal BP with a mean sedimentation rate of 44.6 cm/ka. The sub-centennial resolution of our proxy records reveals strong fluctuations of the EAM and vegetation density for the past similar to 3770 cal BP. The greater contents of coarse and medium sediments with overall decreasing trends from 3770 to 2000 cal BP suggest an increasing fine sediment influx from the catchment likely due to an increasing lake water level. Although low TOC content, C/N ratio, and enriched delta C-13 values in bulk and fine sediments during this interval suggest a sparsely vegetated catchment, increasing trends of TOC content and C/N ratio together with decreasing trends of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values indicate a strengthening pattern of summer monsoon. This is in contrast to a decreasing monsoon strength inferred from Dongge Cave delta O-18 record at that time, supporting the idea of anti-phasing of summer EAM and Indian summer monsoon. Since 2000 cal BP, higher content of fine sediments with high TOC content and C/N ratio but relatively depleted delta C-13 and low delta N-15 values suggest a high but stable lake water level and dense C3 plants, consistent with a stronger summer monsoon in a wet climate. Within this general trend, we interpret a prominent change of proxy parameters in sediments from similar to 560 to 150 cal BP, as subtropical evidence for the Little Ice Age in NE Taiwan. By comparing our proxy records with other diverse land and marine records from southern China and adjoining marine realm, we demonstrate that the centennial to millennial-scale fluctuations of the summer EAM over the northeastern Taiwan during the late Holocene have been largely modulated by the tropical Pacific forcing through El Nino along with solar forcing.

Sea and lake surface temperature retrieval from Landsat thermal data in Northern Germany	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Landsat thermal data are employed to derive lake and sea surface temperatures. The limitations of this approach are obvious, since the calculation of surface temperatures based solely on image data requires at least two thermal bands to compensate the atmospheric influence which is mainly caused by water vapour absorption. However, the 1 km spatial resolution of currently available multiband thermal satellite sensors (NOAA-AVHRR, MODIS) is often not appropriate for lake and coastal zone applications. Therefore, it is worthwhile investigating the accuracy which can be obtained with single-band thermal data using radiosonde information of the atmospheric water vapour column from meteorological stations in the study area. In addition, standard atmospheres from the MODTRAN code were considered that are based on seasonal climatologic values of water vapour, e. g. mid-latitude summer, mid-latitude winter, etc. The study area of this investigation comprises various lakes and coastal zones of the Baltic Sea in NE Germany. Landsat- 7 ETM+ imagery of nine acquisition dates was selected covering the time span from February to November 2000. Results of derived lake and sea surface temperatures were compared with in situ measurements and with an empirical model of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (Germany's National Meteorological Service, DWD). RMS deviations of 1.4K were obtained for the satellite-derived lake surface temperatures with respect to in situ measurements and 2.2K with respect to the empirical DWD model. RMS deviations of 1.6K were obtained with respect to in situ bulk temperatures in coastal zones of the Baltic Sea. This level of agreement can be considered as satisfactory given the principal constraints of this approach. A better accuracy can only be obtained with high spatial resolution (< 100 m) multi-band thermal instruments delivering imagery on an operational basis.

The two clusters of ages recognized: 4.3 to 2.6 Ma, and 2.2-pre 0.8 Ma, corresponding to these tuff groups, are in agreement with pulses of ignimbrite eruptions in the Altiplano Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC), and Southenn Puna calderas located west of the study region. The ash-fall tuffs of both groups are mainly vitreous to phenocryst-poor of rhyodacite-dacite composition with minor andesites to trachyandesites, characterized by 58-69% SiO2 contents, A/CNK 1-1.4, FeO/MgO (0.8-2.8), which plot in the calc-alkaline range. They can be differentiated based on its immobile trace elements ratios as indicated by a slight enrichment in LREE, higher arc affiliation and somewhat higher Sm/Yb ratios in the case of the younger group, although in both Sm/Yb ratios are indicative of sequestration of HREE in residual hornblende. The new geochemical and geochronological data of those ash fall tuffs point to these as chrono-stratigraphic tracers of the Humahuaca and Casa Grande intermountain basins stratigraphy, during the Pliocene-Pleistocene, also as the key to identify their volcanic sources.

J	Smith, LM; Haukos, DA; Prather, RM				Smith, LM; Haukos, DA; Prather, RM			Avian response to vegetative pattern in playa wetlands during winter	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Breeding-bird communities inhabiting northern prairie wetlands have been shown to have higher densities and diversities in wetlands with a well-interspersed 50:50 vegetative cover:water ratio than in those wetlands with a higher or lower proportion of cover. Potential reasons for such a response include increased food or visual isolation and spacing of breeding birds. We manipulated cover:water ratios (75:25, 50:50, 25:75) in Southern Great Plains playas and examined avian response (i.e., species richness, nonwaterfowl bird density, and waterfowl density) to these patterns in winter. We found the highest species richness and generally the highest waterfowl densities in the 50:50 cover:water treatment. Because the amount of vegetative food was similar among treatments and waterfowl inhabiting playas during winter are forming pair bonds, it is most likely that the optimal edge and visual isolation provided in the 50:50 cover:water treatment contributed to its high use and richness. Nonwaterfowl bird density was not different among the treatments. Many nonwaterfowl birds using playas in winter, such as McCown's longspur (Calcarius mccownii), occur as nonbreeding feeding flocks, are not forming pair bonds, and likely are not responding to particular cover:water treatments. Playa wetland biologists should create a well-interspersed 50:50 cover:water ratio to optimize waterfowl use and avian species richness.																			2328-5540					SUM	2004	32	2					474	480		10.2193/0091-7648(2004)32[474:ARTVPI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2004)32[474:ARTVPI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222701800018

Climatology of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances observed by the midlatitude Blackstone SuperDARN radar	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS												A climatology of daytime midlatitude medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) observed by the Blackstone Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar is presented. MSTIDs were observed primarily from fall through spring. Two populations were observed: a dominant population heading southeast (centered at 147 degrees geographic azimuth, ranging from 100 degrees to 210 degrees) and a secondary population heading northwest (centered at -50 degrees azimuth, ranging from -75 degrees to -25 degrees) Horizontal velocities ranged from 50 to 250 m s(-1) with a distribution maximum between 100 and 150 m s(-1). Horizontal wavelengths ranged from 100 to 500 km with a distribution peak at 250 km, and periods between 23 and 60 min, suggesting that the MSTIDs may be consistent with thermospheric gravity waves. A local time (LT) dependence was observed such that the dominant (southeastward) population decreased in number as the day progressed until a late afternoon increase. The secondary (northwestward) population appeared only in the afternoon, possibly indicative of neutral wind effects or variability of sources. LT dependence was not observed in other parameters. Possible solar-geomagnetic and tropospheric MSTID sources were considered. The auroral electrojet (AE) index showed a correlation with MSTID statistics. Reverse ray tracing with the HINDGRATS model indicates that the dominant population has source regions over the Great Lakes and near the geomagnetic cusp, while the secondary population source region is 100 km above the Atlantic Ocean east of the Carolinas. This suggests that the dominant population may come from a region favorable to either tropospheric or geomagnetic sources, while the secondary population originates from a region favorable to secondary waves generated via lower atmospheric convection.

Abundance, equivalent spherical volume (ESV), and equivalent surface area (ESA) of particles were quantified by combining microscopic observation with image analysis. Average concentration of TEP in water was approximately seven-fold higher than that of CSP, and the average ESV and ESA of TEP were both greater than those of CSP. TEP abundance ranged from 5.27 x 10(3) to 23 x 10(4) particles/mL, with ESV from 1.09 x 10(6) to 7.44 x 10(6) mu m(3)/mL and ESA from 3.28 x 10(6) to 2.23 x 10(7) mu m(2)/mL. CSP abundance varied from 2.43 x 10(2) to 3.81 x 10(3) particles/mL, with ESV from 1.62 x 10(4) to 7.12 x 10(5) mu m(3)/mL and ESA from 4.85 x 104 to 2.14 x 106 mu m(2)/mL During spring, small particles (equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) < 20 mu m) were dominant. The size distributions of TEP and CSP in the entire lake followed a power law, with abundance of particle scaling with particle diameter. The size spectra of TEPwere also higher than that of CSP in the lake. The high abundance of TEP and CSP during spring in Lake Taihu signified not only that they could play a critical and dynamic role in nutrient cycling in this lake ecosystembut also that they are part of carbon and nitrogen storage in spring when Microcystis begins to bloom, and they could be especially important for influencing bloom outbreaks.

J	James, WF; Barko, JW				James, WF; Barko, JW			Diffusive fluxes and equilibrium processes in relation to phosphorus dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												We examined total suspended solids (TSS) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) above naturally impounded Lake Pepin between 1994 and 1996, with attention to P loadings which may be contributing to impaired water quality conditions. The Minnesota River, located 97 km upstream of Lake Pepin, accounted for most of the annual and summer TSS and total P load while the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant, located 80 km upstream of Lake Pepin, accounted for much of the annual soluble reactive P (SRP) loading to the UMR. Lake Pepin retained 80% and 13% of the TSS and total P load, respectively, during the summer period. However, the lake was a source of SRP during the same period, exporting up to 130% of the summer SRP load it received. Diffusive P flux from profundal sediments averaged 7.5 mg m(-2) d(-1) during the summer, accounting for 41% of the net SRP export from the lake. Recently deposited sediments in Lake Pepin (originating primarily from the Minnesota River) also exhibited a high equilibrium P concentration (EPC = 0.155 mg l(-1)) and linear adsorption coefficient (K-d = 1043 1 kg(-1)). Application of these P equilibrium characteristics to TSS loads entering the system resulted in a calculated potential P desorption flux from TSS of 2.0 mg m(-2) d(-1) during the summer. Potential P desorption flux to the system was driven by dilution of SRP concentrations in the Mississippi River below the EPC by SRP-deficient inflows of the St Croix River, located 16 km upstream of the lake.

The hot springs and hydrothermal calcite in the Himalayas are characterized by radiogenic Sr related to meta-morphic processes. Such metamorphism-driven processes have contributed significant amounts of radiogenic Sr to rivers and groundwater, which has affected the evolution of global seawater (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 during the Cenozoic. However, whether such hydrothermal systems with highly radiogenic Sr occur in other continental collisional belts with intense metamorphism remains unknown, which hinders a better understanding of regional and global Sr cycles. Compiled (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios in surface water around the Tibetan Plateau show that the Qilian-North Qaidam region displays a higher (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio than other regions, except for the Himalayas. Here, we report (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios of a hydrothermal system on the northern margin of the early Paleozoic North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt, NE Tibetan Plateau. The high (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios (0.757-0.734) of the hot spring water and the acetic acid leachates of the surrounding rocks (gneiss and schist) with other isotopic tracers (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, lithium, and boron isotopes) indicate that 1) Sr was exchanged during metamorphism between car-bonate and silicate phases in crustal rocks and the high (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio of the hot spring water was acquired from a deep water-rock reaction process; and 2) hydrothermal systems around the Qilian-North Qaidam region operate like those in the Himalayas. Mass balance calculations indicate that the metamorphism-forced hydro-thermal system plays a key role in delivering radiogenic Sr to rivers and lakes and yielding higher (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86/Sr-86 ratios in surface water around the Qilian Shan region than in the surrounding areas. The reactivated early Paleozoic Qilian orogenic belts with ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism caused by the India-Asia collision have significantly impacted the regional water (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio, suggesting that the reactivated old orogenic belts with intense metamorphic processes formed by continental subduction/collision can play a pivotal role in regulating past seawater (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 evolution.

Scale-dependent drivers of ungulate patch use along a temporal and spatial gradient of snow depth	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Anthropogenic changes in landscape composition or configuration have the potential to increase the abundance of generalist species, often resulting in cascading effects on other trophic levels and ecosystem function. The selection or utilization of individual patches of habitat, however, may vary in both time and space, as a result of patch and landscape attributes as well as dynamic abiotic factors (i.e., snowfall). We hypothesized that the use of high-quality habitat would be most strongly influenced by snow at local scales and by composition and the configuration of the landscape at greater spatial scales. To test this, we examined white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) selection of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) patches as winter habitat over a 3-year period. Patch-level attributes were poor predictors of patch use in areas with strong gradients in abiotic factors relevant to the energetics of movement or forage acquisition. Additionally, heterogeneity in the greater landscape (3000 m radius buffer) served to increase use, while homogeneity appeared to decrease use. Our results suggest that interactions between deer migratory behavior, interannual variation in winter severity, and landscape context might provide spatial and temporal refugia for hemlock regeneration; a better understanding of which could aide conservation and restoration.

The dam also functions to store and regulate the downstream releases of water in order to provide flood control and navigational support in addition to hydropower generation. Flow regulation is particularly important for alleviating the impacts of low- and high-flow events during the summer rainy season (June, July, and August). The impact of dam operations on summer flows is the focus of this work. Naturalized flows are modelled using a canonical correlation analysis and covariates of subbasin-scale precipitation resulting in good model skill with an average correlation of 0.92. The model is then used to estimate natural flows in the period after dam operation. A comparison between modelled and gauged streamflow post 2003 is made and the impact of the dam on downstream flow is assessed. Streamflow variability is found to be strongly related to rainfall variability. An analysis of regional streamflow variability across the Yangtze River Basin showed a mode of spatially negatively correlated variability between the upper and lower basin areas. The Three Gorges Dam likely mitigated the occurrence of high-flow events at Yichang station located near the dam. However, the high flow at the remaining stations in the lower reach is not noticeably alleviated due to the diminishing influence of the dam on distant downstream flows and the impact of the lakes downstream of the dam that act to attenuate flows. Three types of flow regime changes between naturalized and observed flows were defined and used to assess the changes in the occurrence of high- and low-flow events resulting from dam operations.					; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022	Ho, Michelle/0000-0002-1513-8016; Su, Zhenkuan/0000-0003-4426-8992; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 30	2020	34	3					705	717		10.1002/hyp.13619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13619		NOV 2019											WOS:000498220400001

Hyporheic zone delineation and its nutrients exchange quantification are quite difficult in karst spring. To evaluate the source of organic matter (OM) and its environmental indication, 45 surface sediments were collected in a karst pool to determine the content of grain size, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and stable isotope. C/N ratios showed that 83 % of OM is autochthonous source, but the contribution of OM carried by surface water backflow cannot be ignored. A high C/N ratios zone could be found in the tail of the pool. This is ascribed to surface river backflowing in extremely high water level. delta C-13 of OM ranged from -29.27 to -22.40 %, and they were consistent with isotope of local hydrophyte in the spring. Combined with elemental analysis, isotopic composition, grain size distribution and human activities, detailed water environmental function zones in the pool were defined; especially, the active hyporheic zone was determined. Our data reveal that the nature and distribution of OM are complex and dynamic in a karst hyporheic zone. Organic biogeochemistry may play more important role and drive the evolution of aquatic environment.

J	Felip, M; Catalan, J				Felip, M; Catalan, J			The relationship between phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll in a deep oligotrophic lake: decoupling in their spatial and temporal maxima	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The seasonal distributions of phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll a content were monitored for 14 months in a deep oligotrophic, high mountain lake (Redo, Pyrenees). An allometric relationship of chlorophyll with biovolume was found throughout the period studied, with a correlation coefficient of 0.66. However, the relationship changed with season and the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton. Both parameters showed a similar seasonal pattern, but differences in space and time were observed. The chlorophyll maximum was recorded deeper and later than that of phytoplankton biovolume. While the biovolume maximum was related to an improvement in conditions for growth (nutrient input during column mixing periods), and reflected an increase in biomass, the chlorophyll maximum was related to changes in cell pigment content, and to spatial or successional trends in species dominance. Flagellated chrysophytes predominated at the chlorophyll maxima. Chlorophyll content per unit of phytoplankton biovolume fluctuated greatly throughout the year, depending on light intensity, temperature and phytoplankton composition. Of the main groups of phytoplankton in the lake, the dinoflagellates, which dominated the summer epilimnion phytoplankton community, recorded the lowest pigment content per biovolume (which is consistent with their size). Higher chlorophyll contents per biovolume were found in the deep hypolimnion and during the winter cover period associated with small cells such as some species of chlorococcales chlorophytes. When flagellated chrysophytes were predominant, a broad range of chlorophyll values per biovolume was found and there was no significant correlation between the two biomass indices. These findings reaffirm the need to treat phytoplankton biomass estimates with caution, in particular when conducting primary production studies. While our results show that changes in chlorophyll content per cell occur as a photoacclimation response along a vertical profile, they also point out a component of the successional trends which appear in a phytoplankton growth phase in a lake.

Rather than using model predictions of greenhouse warming, this paper looks at the changes in heat balance and temperature profiles in a particularly warm year (1988) compared to a more normal one (1971). The comparisons are made for three different morphometrically different lakes located 45-degrees-N latitude and 93-degrees-W longitude (north central United States) and for the summer period (April 1 to October 31). Water temperatures are daily values simulated with a model driven by daily weather parameters and verified against several sets of measurements. The results show that in the warmer year epilimnetic water temperatures were higher, evaporative water loss increased, and summer stratification occurred earlier in the season.																			0043-1397					AUG	1991	27	8					1837	1846		10.1029/91WR01281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91WR01281													WOS:A1991FZ85600006

Summer phytoplankton nutrient limitation in Maumee Bay of Lake Erie during high-flow and low-flow years	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Algal production in Maumee Bay in western Lake Erie is highly affected by inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the Maumee River, which drains predominantly agricultural lands, leading to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms. In a 3-year study, precipitation and discharge ranged from relatively low (2012) to relatively high (2011) with corresponding changes in the size of the cyanobacterial bloom. This study aimed to quantify the relation between river discharge and algal nutrient limitation in Maumee Bay. During the summer growing seasons, 20 nutrient enrichment bioassays were performed to determine which nutrient (P or N) might limit phytoplankton growth; and ambient N and P concentrations were monitored. The bioassays suggested that phytoplankton growth shifted from P-limited to N-limited during summer of the low and intermediate discharge years (2012 and 2010, respectively), whereas during the high discharge year (2011) phytoplankton were nutrient-replete before becoming N-limited. Phosphorus-replete growth during the high discharge year likely was due to high P loads from the river and dissolved P concentrations greater than 1 mu mol/L. Symptoms of N-limited growth occurred during August and September in all three years and during July of 2012 when NO; plus NH4+ concentration was less than 7.29 mu mol/L suggesting low or no correspondence between N-limitation and size of the cyanobacterial bloom. Occurrence of a relatively small cyanobacterial bloom in 2012 following the record-breaking bloom in 2011 suggests the possibility of fast-reversal of eutrophication in Maumee Bay if P loading from the watershed could be decreased.

Control of medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and other annual grasses with imazapic	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Invasive annual grasses, such as medusahead, can reduce forage production capacity and interfere with revegetation projects in California rangelands. Because of the taxonomic similarity to other more desirable grasses, achieving selective control of invasive annual grasses can be difficult. In selectivity trials conducted in Yolo and Siskiyou counties, CA, the herbicide imazapic gave control of many normative annual grasses yet provided some level of selectivity to specific perennial grasses used in revegetation projects throughout the western United States. The selectivity difference between newly seeded perennial and annual grasses was greater with PRE applications than with POST treatments. Both perennial and annual grasses within the tribe Hordeae were more tolerant to imazapic than other grass species. In addition, field experiments were conducted at three sites in northern California (Yuba, Yolo, and Lassen counties) and one in southern Oregon (Lake County) to test the response of imazapic to varying management conditions. Imazapic was applied PRE in fall (and also spring in Lake County) at rates from 35 to 210 g/ha on undisturbed rangeland, in comparison with rangeland cleared of standing plant material and thatch by either tillage, mowing and raking, or burning. Imazapic generally showed enhanced weed control when applied following disturbance. Rates as low as 70 g/ha, if combined with thatch removal, provided significant suppression of medusahead. In addition, disturbance alone generally reduced medusahead cover in the following year. Although imazapic showed potential for control of medusahead and other annual grasses, its selectivity window was relatively narrow.																			0890-037X					JAN-MAR	2007	21	1					66	75		10.1614/WT-06-027.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WT-06-027.1													WOS:000245166300012
J	Allen, JRM; Huntley, B				Allen, Judy R. M.; Huntley, Brian			Effects of tephra falls on vegetation: A Late-Quaternary record from southern Italy	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Impacts of tephra deposition on vegetation are recorded in a series of 10 high temporal resolution absolute pollen diagrams from Lago Grande di Monticchio, each diagram spanning a single tephra deposition event during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Sediment accumulation rates determined by counting and measurement of annual laminations (varves) provide an accurate and precise chronology, enabling the minimum recovery time after a tephra fall to be determined. In most cases, pollen accumulation rate was reduced after the tephra fall, indicating reduced vegetation productivity. Tephra deposition events also led to changes in vegetation composition, although these varied in magnitude. The magnitude and duration of the impacts upon the vegetation were related to the thickness of the tephra layer deposited, the thickest layers examined (>250mm) having minimum recovery times of up to a century and thicker layers generally having greater impacts upon pollen productivity and vegetation composition. Tephra chemistry also influenced the persistence of the impact. The nature of the prevailing vegetation prior to the tephra fall influenced the degree and persistence of the impact. Tephra layers <30mm thick had minimum recovery times of up to 90years when they fell on wooded steppe vegetation, whereas cold steppe recovered much more quickly, as did forest. The relative sensitivity of wooded steppe was contrary to our expectations. Of individual pollen taxa, Cupressaceae emerged as particularly sensitive to tephra deposition.Synthesis. Applying absolute pollen analytical methods to a sediment record with a well-supported and precise chronology obtained from a lake in a volcanic region where the vegetation has been subject to numerous tephra deposition events enabled us to explore the impacts of such events. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts upon individual plant taxa and of differential sensitivity of three vegetation types that have prevailed in the region during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. The influences of tephra thickness and chemistry on minimum recovery time were substantial. Our results are relevant to forecasting the potential impacts upon ecosystems of volcanic eruptions.

J	Rolletschek, H				Rolletschek, H			Temporal and spatial variations in methane cycling in Lake Muggelsee	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Porewater concentration of CH4 and SO42-, the depth distribution of organic matter and the C/N ratio were studied at one profundal and two littoral sites in Lake Muggelsee. CH4 release and oxidation rates were measured using intact sediment cores. The CH4 concentration in profundal sediments varied considerably, with maximum values in winter (470 mu mol/l). Conversely, the highest CH4 concentrations in littoral sediments were measured in late summer months (310 mu mol/l). The concentrations and calculated diffusive fluxes of SO42- and CH4 were negatively correlated. In profundal sediments, SO42- reduction was the outstanding process in terms of C mineralization and O-2 consumption compared to methanogenesis as derived from stoichiometric relations. The gross CH4 release was lowest at profundal sediments (0.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and highest at the littoral accumulation site (11.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). From the ratio of gross and net CH4 release, it can be calculated that 84-91% of the upward diffusing CH4 will be oxidized at the sediment surface corresponding to CH4 oxidation rates of 0.68 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at profundal sediments and 1.53-10.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at littoral sediments. The methanotrophic O-2 demand at the sediment surface was of little importance compared to the total O-2 consumption with the exception of littoral accumulation zones.																			0003-9136					AUG	1997	140	2					195	206																WOS:A1997YB25300003

Lake Nissiou is located 15 km to the N-NW of the town Edessa, in the region of Macedonia, in Northern Greece. The Ca2+ concentration in the exit waters was found to have decreased to a percentage of 67-83% of the same total in the groundwater supply, whereas the opposite trend was observed for Mg2+ which increased to 144-199% with respect to the total Mg2+ contained in the groundwater supply. The ratio of the equivalent concentrations of [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] vs [HCO3-] in the exit waters was a little lower than the one (0.95-0.98) thus showing that the presence of dissolved Ca2+ and Mg2+ was mainly due to the existence of HCO3-, although the formation of coordination compounds with organic ligands was to be expected to some extent. The sum of the [Ca2+]+[Mg2+] concentrations, in mu eq l(-1), in the exit waters was also a little higher than in the groundwater supply from both karst spring-fed inlets in all experimental samples. The ratio of [Ca2+]:[Mg2+] in the groundwater supply, r(supply) = 1.98 +/- 0.21, was almost 2.5 times greater than in the exit waters, r(exit) = 0.81 +/- 0.07, indicating that considerable changes took place in the Ca2+ and Mg2+ composition within the lake and besides that the lake itself acted as a regulator in the formation of an almost constant compositional ratio in the outflows. These changes, originating with the interposition of the artificial Lake Nissiou in 1959, are expected to reduce the deposition of calcareous tufa downstream along the Edesseos stream ending in the falls of Edessa which are 15 km distance away. The concentrations of dissolved Na+ were little affected in the lake whereas these of K+ showed some variation of between 86-122 % of the total from the groundwater supply from January to May and 60-79% from July to September. The concentrations of Cl- were almost unchanged and those of SO42- surprisingly high in the groundwater spring-fed inlet from Vrytta, decreased even up to 15% in the exit waters. However, in the exit waters the Normalised Inorganic Charge Balance was found to be within experimental error (less than 5.4%, average 3.4%). Conductivity, pH and temperature measurements were also made.

Despite the different sensitivity of the lacustrine basins to environmental changes, interpreting the records in terms of paleohydrology, climate, and more especially timing of events is difficult. Notwithstanding these problems, Lake Titicaca in the north and Lake Pocoyu (Lake Poopo, salars of Coipasa and Uyuni) in the south reveal a similar evolution in general trends through the course of time. During the Minchin phase (until 30-26 kyr BP), the Altiplano was wetter than present. The Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 26-14 kyr BP), marked by cooler, drier conditions, was followed by a return to a wetter climate, interrupted by short arid events, between ca. 14 and 10.5 kyr BP. Another cycle of aridity, between 10.5 and 8 kyr BP, took place abruptly just after the humid Tauca phase. The mid-Holocene is interpreted as climatically unstable, with an alternation of humid and dry episodes. Since 3.9 kyr BP, wetter conditions have persisted and intensified to the present. The data are interpreted in terms of changes in inter-tropical convergence zone extension (summer precipitation) and in polar air mass intensity (winter precipitation).

J	Martens, K				Martens, K			Two new crenobiont ostracod genera (Crustacea, ostracoda, herpetocypridinae) from Africa and Asia Minor, with the description of a new species from dolomitic springs in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A new genus in the Herpetocypridinae is established for the species of the Stenocypris subterranea group; eleven species are here assigned to this genus. A new species, Humphcypris greenwoodi n.sp., is described from bisexual populations from dolomitic springs in the North West Province (former western Transvaal) of South Africa and the male of H. subterranea (Hartmann) is described for the first time from a spring in northern Israel. Somalicypris n. gen. is established for the Somalian endemic Acocypris uegitia Masi and differs from Humphcypris n. gen. in aspects of the antennal and hemipenis morphology. Both new genera are closely related to Psychrodromus and it is here postulated that both Psychrodromus and Humphcypris originated from a common, Herpetocypris-like ancestor; around the eastern Mediterranean, in the Mesozoic. The origin of the Somalicypris-branch from Humphcypris in East Africa is much more recent. Most species in this Afro-Eurasian lineage are crenobiont and live at a surface-groundwater interface, such as springs, wells and caves; a few species have been described from epigean lakes. Psychrodromus occurs in Europe and the western part of Asia. Most species of Humphcypris are known from Africa; H. subterranea and H. condarensis occur in Asia and Asia Minor Somalicypris uegitia is endemic to the Horn of Africa.

While the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery prevents inclusion of all water-filled crevasses and narrow rivers, our findings include: (1) strong interannual differences are observed in total surface water area (4903km(2) vs. 9988 km(2)), volume (3.5 km(3) vs. 6.8 km(3)), and mean elevation limit (1407 m a.s.l. vs. 1545 m a.s.l.) in response to a low (cool) (265 Gt/yr) and high (warm) (510 Gt/yr) runoff year; (2) large spatial contrasts in surface water extent, volume, elevation limit, and drainage pattern among the eight major GrIS basins; (3) supraglacial rivers dominate GrIS surface water appearance, accounting for 57%/48% of total surface water area/volume, respectively, over the two years (in contrast, water-filled crevasses and supraglacial lakes account for 33%/32% and 10%/20%, respectively); (4) ratio of remotely sensed water volume to RACMO-simulated cumulative surface runoff declines during the cool (2.6%) vs. the warm (1.8%) year; and from north (4.5%) to south (1.1%) Greenland. In summary, this study reveals strong temporal and spatial differences in GrIS surface water extent, volume, and drainage pattern and raises prospects for improved understanding of pan-Greenland Ice Sheet surface hydrology.

This study assessed the interaction of geographical factors (lakes, wetlands, forests, watercourse slope, and river network density) with selected flood characteristics (specific runoff of maximum discharge of spring flood (q(max)) and the date of maximum discharge of spring flood (Q(max_date))). In 1985, 2000, 2015, and 2019, the lakes, wetlands, and forests were investigated in 11 catchment areas using satellite images and semi-automatic classification. The highest correlation coefficients were for the average of q(max) (0.97-0.98) during the calibration. The validation of Q(max_date) revealed a weaker relationship (0.67 to 0.83) with the selected geographical factors. Based on regression models, forests and river network densities were the most influential geographical parameters. The findings of this study can be used to assess spring floods and geographical factors in ungauged catchments.

Results show that the temperature of water source in Chongqing's lakes and reservoirs excelled the air temperature, and the water quality basically meets the requirements of open-lakes WSHPs. Thus the water source in Chongqing's lakes and reservoirs is a hot and cold source of good quality. For depth of water is greater than 6m, there is an obvious vertical stratification of water temperature in summer, which is not obvious in winter. pH value, turbidity and algal density also have obvious characteristics in vertical distribution, while hardness and salinity have little characteristics. According to the spatial and temporal distribution features of water temperature and water quality, water intake head should be installed in the middle and lower layer of the lake. Less investment and water head loss, lower operation and maintenance costs, and higher reliability should be considered when we choose the way of water intake for WSHPs in Chongqing. Water intake ways such as pump truck water intake, pontoon intake, gravity pipe intake, integrated device are alternative. Comparison between technical and economic should be made first.

It has poor internal drainage due to its naturally dense subsoil and is susceptible to physical degradation because of its unstable surface. Tillage studies were conducted from 1983 to 1985 to evaluate the potential for reducing the physical limitations of Charity clay. Treatments consisted of four combinations of a primary and secondary tillage variable. The primary tillage variable involved the application or omission of deep tillage using a triple-shanked subsoiler prior to moldboard plowing. The secondary tillage variable involved the presence or absence of tractor wheel traffic prior to planting. Subsoiling improved the physical conditions of Charity clay below the Ap horizon. Soil bulk density (.rho.b) was reduced by 0.05 Mg m-3, and pore size distribution (PSD) was altered such that the volume of pores with radii larger than 150 .mu.m was doubled. Preplant wheel traffic caused subsoil compaction, increasing .rho.b by about 0.06 Mg m-3, and altered all indicators of soil compaction in the Ap horizon, especially PSD and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The need to minimize wheel traffic regardless of the primary tillage practices employed was evidenced by the results of this study.

J	Ostendorp, W				Ostendorp, W			Management impacts on stand structure of lakeshore Phragmites reeds	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material, natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm densities (+76% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass (+13%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13%. The percentage of insect infested shoots was 8.8% of the total shoot population compared with 20.1% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment had stopped the reed stands showed an 'overshoot' biomass production, and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and benefits.																			1434-2944						1999	84	1					33	47																WOS:000079116100004
J	SUTCLIFFE, DW; CARRICK, TR				SUTCLIFFE, DW; CARRICK, TR			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHLORIDE AND MAJOR CATIONS IN PRECIPITATION AND STREAMWATERS IN THE WINDERMERE CATCHMENT (ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The ranges of concentrations for pH, Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ are given for streams draining igneous rocks (Borrowdale Volcanics) and sedimentary muds, silts and shales (Silurian Slates) in the catchment of Windermere (230 km2). Impacts on the biota are briefly discussed. Relative contributions of inputs from various sources are examined: precipitation, rocks and soils, sewage, deicing salt used on highways. In bulk precipitation, ratios of Na+/Cl- (as .mu.eq. l-1) ranged from 0.41-1.83 over a 2 yr period. The overall volume-weighted mean ratio was 0.86, as in seawater, but 2.4% (1975) and 5.7% (1976) of Cl- was non-marine in origin, being balanced by H+ (in winter), K+ and Ca2+ (in summer). In moorland headwater streams, Cl- is largely derived from precipitation; there is a pronounced annual cycle of midwinter high and midsummer low concentrations unrelated to stream discharge. Na+ and K+ display similar cycles but Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ (and pH) are discharge related due to leaching from rocks and soils: 10-20% Na+, 15-17% Mg2+ and 65-75% Ca2+ are so-derived; K+ comes from precipitation. Na+/Cl- ratios in streams on Borrowdale Volcanics alter seasonally, with midsummer values > 1.0. Lower values occur in streams on Silurian Slates where some Cl- is apparently derived from rocks. Seasonal changes in streamwater concentrations of Cl-, Na+ and K+ are exponentially related to time. Instantaneous rates of change (% day-1) are compared in relation to position in the catchment and inputs from anthropogenic sources. Deicing salt has raised (10- to 100-fold) the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in streams on mountain passes; the effects persist throughout the year.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	5					415	441		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00002.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00002.x													WOS:A1983RL26500002

Both the proxy-data and model results show a cooling that is mainly concentrated in the North Atlantic region. ranging from more than 5 degrees C cooling in the Nordic Seas to about 0.5-1 degrees C over Europe and less than 0.5 degrees C over the subtropical North Atlantic. Data and model also indicate a weakening of the summer monsoon and generally a drier circum-North Atlantic. Over the South Atlantic Ocean, the model simulates a slight warming (mostly less than 0.5 degrees C), which falls within the uncertainty of proxy data and thus could not be confirmed. To examine in detail the structure of the 8.2 ka BP event, we also compare the modeled climatological evolution at two locations with high-quality records, revealing a generally consistent picture. The good model-data agreement confirms the hypothesis that the 8.2 ka BP event was forced by a freshwater-induced weakening of the thermohaline circulation. Other forcings are unlikely, since they would result in an alternative geographical distribution and expression of the climate response. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Newton, PF				Newton, Peter F.			Quantifying the Effects of Wood Moisture and Temperature Variation on Time-of-Flight Acoustic Velocity Measures within Standing Red Pine and Jack Pine Trees	FORESTS												The relationship between the dynamic modulus of elasticity (m(e)) of xylem tissue and acoustic velocity (v(d)) has been established for a number of commercially-important coniferous species, including red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.). However, v(d) has been shown to vary systematically with xylem temperature (t(x)) and moisture (m(x)) for some species, and hence when the calibrated m(e-)v(d) relationships are used outside of the range of conditions under which they were parameterized, erroneous predictions may arise. Consequently, the objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the significance of t(x) and m(x) effects on v(d) measurements within standing red pine and jack pine trees, and (2), given (1), to develop correction equations for standardizing v(d) measurements to referenced t(x) and m(x) conditions if warranted. Analytically, based on a temporal replicated sampling design, 26 mature red pine and 36 semi-mature jack pine trees growing in managed plantations located within central Ontario, Canada (Kirkwood Forest, Great LakesSt. Lawrence Forest Region), were continuously measured for v(d), t(x), and m(x) during the spring-to-autumn seasonal periods in 2016 (red pine) and 2017 (jack pine). A total of 6 measurement events per species occurred at approximately 4-8 week intervals in which a total of 624 red pine and 864 jack pine cardinal-specific (north, east, south, and west) breast-height acoustic velocity, xylem temperature, and xylem moisture measurements were obtained: Yielding a total of 156 red pine and 216 jack pine mean tree-based values available for analysis. Over the sampling periods, (1) mean tree xylem temperatures ranged from a minimum of 3 degrees C to a maximum of 31 degrees C (mean = 19.2 degrees C) in red pine and from a minimum of 0 degrees C to a maximum of 27 degrees C (mean = 16.5 degrees C) in jack pine, and (2) mean tree xylem moistures ranged from a minimum 31% to a maximum of 45% (mean = 38.6%) in red pine and from a minimum 25% to a maximum of 50% (mean = 38.8%) in jack pine. Graphical examination of the moisture effect on the v(d) and t(x) relationship by tree and species revealed inversely proportional, linear-like trends at lower moisture levels and directly-proportional, linear-like trends at higher moisture levels where the effect was more evident for red pine than for jack pine. In order to describe this multivariate relationship, species-specific, two-level hierarchical, mixed-effects linear models inclusive of random and fixed effects were specified and subsequently parameterized. The first-level model described the tree-specific v(d)-t(x) relationship deploying a simple linear regression specification, whereas the second-level model expressed the first-level parameter estimates as a linear function of seasonal mean tree moisture. The resultant statistically-validated, parameterized regression models, for which 64% (red pine) and 90% (jack pine) of the v(d) variation was explained, indicated that the v(d)-t(x) relationship varied systematically with seasonal mean moisture level in red pine but not so in jack pine. More precisely, in red pine, v(d) declined with increasing t(x) at lower moisture levels (<38%), but increased with increasing t(x) at higher moisture levels (>38%). Conversely, although v(d) declined with increasing t(x) in jack pine, the relationship was unaffected by changes in seasonal mean tree moisture levels. Consequently, based on the final hierarchical model specifications, correction equations for adjusting observed v(d) values to standardized temperature (20 degrees C) and moisture conditions (40% for red pine) were developed for each species. Across the range of temperatures (approximate to 5 degrees C-30 degrees C) and mean moisture levels (approximate to 30-45%) examined, these equations generated a mean absolute v(d) adjustment of approximately 0.12 km/s for red pine and 0.04 km/s for jack pine. However, based on the corresponding relative magnitude of these adjustments which account for the narrow species-specific v(d) sample ranges observed (0.80 and 0.85 km/s for red pine and jack pine, respectively), the standardization of v(d) estimates could be of operational significance when acoustic sampling during periods in which xylem temperature and moisture levels approach the extremities of their spring-to-autumn seasonal ranges. Overall, the results of this empirical-based assessment, which confirmed the presence of temperature and moisture induced variation in acoustic velocity measures within standing red pine and jack pine trees, were largely in accordance with expectation. The subsequent provision of species-specific correction functions for adjusting observed v(d) sample values to corresponding equivalents referenced to standardized temperature and moisture conditions could assist in mitigating the consequences of environmental variability when acoustic sampling.

J	Kieniewicz, JM; Smith, JR				Kieniewicz, Johanna M.; Smith, Jennifer R.			Hydrologic and climatic implications of stable isotope and minor element analyses of authigenic calcite silts and gastropod shells from a mid-Pleistocene pluvial lake, Western Desert, Egypt	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Authigenic calcite silts at Wadi Midauwara in Kharga Oasis, Egypt, indicate the prolonged presence of surface water during the Marine Isotope Stage 5e pluvial phase recognized across North Africa. Exposed over an area of similar to 4.25 km(2), these silts record the ponding of water derived from springs along the Libyan Plateau escarpment and front surface drainage. The 6180 values of these lacustrine carbonates (-11.3%o to -8.0%o PDB), are too high to reflect equilibrium precipitation with Nubian aquifer water or water of an exclusively Atlantic origin. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of the silts have a modest negative covariance with silt delta O-18 values, suggesting that the water may have experienced the shortest residence time in local aquifers when the water delta O-18 values were highest. Furthermore, intra-shell delta O-18, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca analyses of the freshwater gastropod Melanoides tuberculata are consistent with a perennially fresh water source, suggesting that strong evaporative effects expected in a monsoonal climate did not occur, or that dry season spring flow was of sufficient magnitude to mute the effects of evaporation. The input of a second, isotopically heavier water source to aquifers, possibly Indian Ocean monsoonal rain, could explain the observed trends in delta O-18 and minor element ratios.

The maximum photosynthetic rate of the picoeukaryote community was 1.4 mu g C mu g chlorophyll a (-1) h(-1) at 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

This species grew from June 1988 to April 1989 and showed the highest density in winter, coinciding with the lowest water temperature values and with the period of water circulation. These seasonal dynamics do not accord with the typical description of C. hirundinella in temperate systems as a phytoplankton species of stratified and warm waters. We compared the factors that influenced C hirundinella development in this system with those operating at different latitudes and concluded that the light and temperature conditions would allow C. hirundinella to grow throughout the year in this reservoir. However, the occurrence of this potential growth is probably regulated by ecological factors, such as the presence of hypolimnetic anoxic conditions and the hydraulic regime of the reservoir.

J	Van Luijn, F; Boers, PCM; Lijklema, L; Sweerts, JPRA				Van Luijn, F; Boers, PCM; Lijklema, L; Sweerts, JPRA			Nitrogen fluxes and processes in sandy and muddy sediments from a shallow eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												Nitrogen fluxes and processes were estimated in sandy and muddy sediments from the shallow eutrophic lake Nuldernauw, The Netherlands. N-2, NH4+, NOx- and CH4 fluxes were measured from sediment samples collected throughout the year and incubated under both oxic and anoxic conditions at 2, 12 and 23 degrees C. Fluxes increased with temperature with a mean temperature factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 for a 10 degrees C increase for both sediment types. At the same temperature the total N fluxes (N-2 + NOx- + NH4+) from the muddy sediments were generally larger than those from the sandy sediments. These differences are related to the relatively high availability of decomposable organic matter in the muddy sediments compared to the sandy sediments. Especially the denitrification was influenced by the organic matteI content: 75-90% of the total N flux was denitrified by the muddy sediment whereas only 45-65% was denitrified by the sandy sediments. NH4+ fluxes were much higher and NOx- fluxes were much lower in cores collected just after spring bloom of phytoplankton, compared to cores collected during other periods. This effect was most pronounced at the high incubation temperature. The freshly settled and easily degradable organic matter at the top of the sediment appeared to be of great influence. Based on the results a general concept, combining the effects of temperature and (easily degradable) organic matter on N loss due to the coupled denitrification, was postulated. The concept implies that the coupled denitrification initially increases with increasing contents of (fresh) organic matter and/or temperature. By a further increase of organic matter or temperature, however, more oxygen is consumed by the aerobic mineralization and the CH4 oxidation and little or no oxygen remains available for the oxidation of nitrogen. Consequently no or less coupled denitrification can occur. Although high temperatures are not often found in the Dutch surface waters, these conditions can occur in spring and summer. Then nitrogen removal from the sediment-water system by the coupled nitrification-denitrification will be reduced and ammonium will be released to the overlying water where it can be consumed by algae.

J	Cockburn, JMH; Lamoureux, SF				Cockburn, Jaclyn M. H.; Lamoureux, Scott F.			Century-scale variability in late-summer rainfall events recorded over seven centuries in subannually laminated lacustrine sediments, White, Pass, British Columbia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Formation of annually laminated sediments in Summit Lake, White Pass, British Columbia is controlled by runoff generated by snowpack and glacier melt and major rainfall events. The 700-yr varve record is divided into two subannual series (early and late) based on sedimentological criteria and sedimentary structures within each varve. A comparison of recent subannual laminae with nearby meteorological records supports the interpretation they are formed by river discharge events generated by major snow and glacier melt events and large late-summer rainfall events. A significant correlation exists between the late subannual thickness series and the size of the largest rainfall events in late summer. The long record indicates there was an abrupt increase in the thickness and frequency of major rainfall-induced sedimentary events at the end of the seventeenth century. In addition, the frequency of laminae generated by early runoff events also increased. However, early subannual varve thickness component remains statistically the same as the thickness prior to the end of the seventeenth century. This suggests the change in varve thickness at this time is due to increases in major late-summer rainfall frequency rather than increased sediment availability caused by regional Little Ice Age glacier advances.

Here, we report a continuous Pliocene cyclostratigraphic record from lake deposits of the Xinding Basin, Shanxi Graben, North China, and reconstruct the regional hydrological cycle from this location during similar to 5.2 to 2.56 Ma. Our results show that regional hydrological cycling was consistently dominated by long-and short-eccentricity (405-and 100-kyr) forcing over the Pliocene. Gamma-ray (GR) data (reflecting hydrodynamic changes) show strengthened 100-kyr eccentricity power after similar to 3.5 Ma, whereas 100-kyr eccentricity power preserved in magnetic susceptibility (MS; interpreted as a proxy of pedogenesis and magnetic mineral dissolution) slightly weakened after similar to 3.5 Ma. This orbital power transition at the 100-kyr eccentricity scale may link to expansion of Antarctic ice volume after similar to 3.5 Ma, which enhanced East Asian summer monsoon intensity and thus increased summer rainfall in North China, resulting in changes to hydrological cycling and the expression of eccentricity climate forcing in East Asian basins. In addition, our results demonstrate that the orbital configuration at similar to 4.2-4.4 Ma could have been a contributory factor in strengthening the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon at this time. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric CO2 concentration and global tectonic environment during the Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; 3.3-3 Ma) are very similar to those of today. Therefore, climate change during the Pliocene Warm Period has become a key point for us to predict future climate change. Herein, we have carried out high resolution, continuous Pliocene cyclostratigraphic records in Xinding Basin, Northern China. Our results show that the hydrologic cycles of the East Asian continental basins were mainly controlled by the long-and short orbital eccentricity. Expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet after similar to 3.5 Ma would strengthen significantly East Asian summer monsoon intensity and thus increase summer rainfall in North China through influencing the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, resulting in changes of the hydrological cycles in East Asian basins.

Emerging investigators series: hydrogen sulfide production in municipal stormwater retention ponds under ice covered conditions: a study of water quality and SRB populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Stormwater retention ponds have become an integral component of stormwater management across the world. Under prolonged hypoxia, these ponds are capable of releasing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. In this study, water quality constituents and bacterial communities in sediment were analyzed in two stormwater retention ponds, RSP1 (reference pond) and RSP2 (problematic pond) over a period of two years, to identify the factors driving H2S production and understand the microbial community associated with H2S production in stormwater ponds. It was found that the background total sulfide concentrations were not statistically different between the two ponds during summer (RSP2: 0.012 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.010 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1) and were statistically different during ice covered winter operation (RSP2: 6.375 +/- 1.135 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.016 +/- 0.009 mg L-S-1). The study showed a lack of correlation between total sulfide concentrations in RSP2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand, sulfate, soluble total phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pH. However, DO concentrations demonstrated a strong negative correlation with total sulfides concentrations in RSP2 (p < 0.006, r = -0.58, n = 26), which confirmed DO as the critical water quality parameter linked to H2S production in stormwater ponds. Finally, it was found that seasonal change, ice covered versus non-ice covered operation and a comparison between a H2S emitting pond and non-emitting pond all did not promote a measurable proliferation of sulfatereducing bacteria nor a community shift in the sulfate-reducing bacterial population. Hence, the study demonstrates that sulfide production is a result of increased ubiquitous SRB activity in stormwater retention ponds and the emission of H2S gas is not indicative of SRB proliferation or a population shift towards specific SRB taxa.

A study of the salt lakes and salt springs of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th Conference of the International-Society-for-Salt-Lake-Research	SEP 26-30, 2005	Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Salt Lake Res	Curtin Univ Technol			An 18-month-study of 40 saline wetlands, ranging from 6 to 336 g l(-1), on the west and southern coasts of Eyre Peninsula yielded 88 species of invertebrates, some aquatic plants and a fish. The invertebrates are taxonomically diverse and include 38 crustaceans, 28 insects, 12 molluscs and significantly an aquatic spider, a nemertean, two polychaetes, two sea anemones, a sponge and a bryzoan. Most were tolerant of wide fluctuations in salinity, there being 51 halobionts, 21 halophils and only 16 salt-tolerant freshwater species. Many invertebrates are restricted to the thalassic springs where marine molluscs dominated. Athalassic wetlands were dominated by crustaceans and were of two basic types-coastal and continental. There is evidence of the former evolving biologically into the later, and for some lakes to be still in transition. There is also evidence of increasing salinity in recent decades and already two lakes exhibit severe secondary salinity. Like other salt lakes in Australia the fauna is regionally distinctive.																			0018-8158					JUN	2009	626	1					41	51		10.1007/s10750-009-9736-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9736-6													WOS:000264182000005

We investigated aspects of reproductive biology and recruitment of the non-indigenous Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, collected in the Pascagoula River watershed and from Simmons Bayou, a small tidal system of Biloxi Bay, Mississippi, over a 16-month period. Males ranged from 32.6-430.0 mm total length (TL) and females from 31.7-349.0 mm TL. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) for males or females indicated year-round reproduction with increased spawning intensity in spring (March to May) and in late summer (August to September). Small juveniles (less than or equal to 25 nun TL) were collected every month of the year except March, and multiple size classes were collected suggesting successful recruitment of young. The smallest female with mature oocytes was 79.9 mm, TL, and the size class where 50% of the females were mature was 113 mm TL. Batch fecundity (BF) ranged from 30-2603 oocytes for females, and there was a significant relationship between log(10)-BF and log(10)-TL and log(10)-BF and log(10) EBW. Relative fecundity ranged from 0.89-11.75 oocytes/g EBW. Although Nile Tilapia have low fecundity, parental care essures that the majority of their eggs will survive to the juvenile stage. Low fecundity is further offset by the ability to spawn multiple broods throughout their year-round reproductive season. These reproductive characteristics may give the species a competitive advantage over native fishes. We expect Nile Tilapia to further invade and spread in these coastal watersheds.

J	May, L				May, L			The effect of lake fertilisation on the rotifers of Seathwaite Tarn, an acidified lake in the English Lake District	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 06-11, 1994	POLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL, MIKOLAJKI, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, Polish Hydrobiol Soc, Rotifer Sect	POLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL			Seathwaite Tarn, in the English Lake District, was used as an experimental site to test the feasibility of increasing the pH of an acidified waterbody by adding a phosphorus-based fertiliser solution. The impact of this experiment on the planktonic rotifer community was assessed by monitoring for two years before treatment (1990-1991), and for a further two years once treatment had begun (1992-1993). The pH of the water rose by 0.5 pH units over the period of fertilisation, and the lake became very eutrophic. This had little effect on the species composition of the rotifer assemblage, which continued to reflect the acid, oligotrophic nature of the untreated lake. However, there were marked changes in the levels of abundance of most planktonic species. Population densities of Keratella serrulata and Trichocerca longiseta increased in early spring, compared to pre-treatment levels, apparently due to the rises in chlorophyll-a concentrations. In contrast, Polyarthra dolichoptera became very scarce after fertilisation began. The treatment seemed to have little effect on the population dynamics of the dominant openwater rotifer, Polyarthra remata. In 1993, very high densities of Bosmina coregoni (up to 250 x 10(3) ind m(-3)) developed in response to the eutrophication programme. This seemed to suppress the rotifer community in the summer months.

However, current estimates of CH4 emissions from lakes are uncertain owing to the lack of data on the diel and monthly variability of CH4 emissions. In this study, we conducted monthly diel measurements in Ulansuhai Lake, China during the ice-free period (April to October, 2019) to determine the diel and monthly variability of CH4 emissions. The diffusive CH4 emission flux (FCH4d) from June to September was significantly higher (similar to 5-to 10-fold) than that from April, May, and October, accounting for > 92% of the total emissions. Daytime measurements would overestimate emissions if extrapolated to the whole day because FCH similar to during daytime was higher than that during nighttime. Mean daily FCH similar to emission estimates are overestimated by 25%, ranging from 11% in summer to 46% in spring based solely on daytime measurement. The sampling sites were net sources of CH4 emissions, with total FCH4 of 9.74 +/- 9.06 mmol m(-2) d(-1). FCH4d increased sharply when the water temperature was above 20 degrees C. FCH4 (CO2 eq) accounted for over 90% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 plus CO2), with the majority occurring from June to September. Our findings indicate that diel and monthly variations should be considered for more accurate estimation of CH4 emissions from the lakes with SAV.					xia, xinghui/A-9116-2008	Zhang, Zhuangzhuang/0009-0004-7115-0708													0304-3770	1879-1522				SEP	2023	188								103670	10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103670		MAY 2023											WOS:001013633800001

Also, along its course to the National Park, the Krka river receives sewage loaded with inorganic and organic matter from surrounding inhabited areas. To evaluate all these influences on wafer quality in the National Park aquatory, an intensive monitoring program started in 1995. Materials and methods: Sampling was carried out every month over a one-year period (1995/96) at three different sites along the river course and every three months at additional four sites. Physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters were measured at several points down a vertical profile. These parameters were measured onsite by standard methods. Result and conclusion: The results of one year research showed that the water in this region was still of high quality The content of nutrients and organic matter in water was mainly poor, and microbial density was also low. Only during the wet weather conditions the number of coliform bacteria increased in water However, alter severed days their number decreased in upper layers due to sedimentation process. This process was also observed near the Roski waterfall. On the waterfall and in the surrounding water bacteria were present in abundance near the surface, while several kilometres downstream they appeared only in a deeper layer. Furthermore, an unusually high number of heterotrophic plate-count bacteria (CFU/vol.) was observed in the water in late spring (June) and in autumn (November), especially at 10-m depth. Results of qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton indicated that a high phytoplanktonic activity occurred in the watercourse in May and late September.

The model implements a conceptual soil moisture accounting scheme extended with a groundwater tank and the input data were the monthly time series of rainfall and the potential evapotranspiration. The automatic optimization procedure of the model was implemented using the evolutionary annealing-simplex algorithm for maximum 11,000 iterations, inserting an 18-month observed runoff time series. It showed that hydrologic balance factors had non-physical significance for the study area. The model's manual calibration for a Nash coefficient of 0.85 revealed that actual evapotranspiration constitutes 62.5 % (389.7 mm), runoff 22.7 % (141.8 mm) and infiltration 14.8 % (92.2 mm) of precipitation, showing optimal adaptation of simulated to observed runoff. The model estimated the initial reserve of soil moisture related to the presence of organic matter which increases water retention, a residue of the former lake. It confirmed zero runoff values during the summer months and connected the occurrence of springs and the outflows to other catchments (59.8 mm) with the karstification degree of the study area. The error on the annual rainfall is 4.9 % and is considered acceptable.

Although changing surface conditions have received substantial research interest, changes below the surface remain largely unexplored, despite their importance for turbulent mixing, nutrient cycling, and primary production. In this study, we investigate changes in subsurface thermal structure and timing in Lake Michigan-Huron related to ongoing climate warming. This work utilizes atmospheric reanalysis data to drive the Great Lakes Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (GL-FVCOM), providing three-dimensional hydrodynamic and ice simulations between 1979 and 2021. Results are used to analyze trends in ice and temperature dynamics, revealing significant changes in annually averaged ice cover (- 2.1- - 5.2%/decade), ice thickness (- 0.68 --2.0 cm/decade), surface temperature (+0.47-+ 0.51 ?C/decade), and bottom temperature (+ 0.26- + 0.29 ?C/decade) over the last 40 years, especially in ecologically important bays (e.g., Green Bay, Saginaw Bay). Significant warming was observed at all depth layers (0-270 m), with warming trends in the epilimnion and hypolimnion that agreed well with recent analysis of observational data in Lake Michigan. Shifting stratification dynamics led to dramatic changes in modelled overturning behavior, and earlier spring turnover dates (- 2.2- - 7.5 days/decade) and later fall turnover dates (+ 2.5- + 6.3 days/decade) led to a net lengthening of the stratified period. This study presents one of the most comprehensive analyses of changes in Great Lakes subsurface temperatures to date, providing important context for future climate modelling and coastal management efforts in the region.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Cannon, David/0000-0001-5238-6863; Kessler, James/0000-0001-8643-7569; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332													1616-7341	1616-7228				APR	2023	73	3-4					201	218		10.1007/s10236-023-01544-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-023-01544-0		APR 2023											WOS:000970392100001

N.; Eicher, Ulrich; Ammann, Brigitta			Rapid summer temperature changes during Termination 1a: high-resolution multi-proxy climate reconstructions from Gerzensee (Switzerland)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Quantitative July temperature reconstructions using fossil chironomid and pollen data have been carried out with a high temporal resolution for the Termination la and the late-glacial Interstadial (ca 15 000-13 000 cal years BP) on a sediment core from Gerzensee (Switzerland). The biota-based July temperature reconstructions show a rapid warming of 4-5 degrees C (pollen) and 2-3 degrees C (chironomids) at Termination la (i.e. the onset of the late-glacial Interstadial, ca 14 650 cal. BP). These temperature changes go parallel with a shift of more than 3% in a high-resolution stable oxygen isotope record measured on bulk carbonates from the same core, also indicating a substantial and rapid warming. Pollen-inferred July temperatures follow the shape of the oxygen-isotope record with a generally decreasing trend of ca 2 degrees C throughout the Interstadial, showing even minor cold oscillations of 0.5-1 degrees C in July temperature recorded in many central European sites (e.g. Aegelsee and Gerzensee Oscillations) and the Greenland ice cores (e.g. Gl-ld and GI-1 b). Chironomid-inferred summer temperatures, however, show a gradual increase of ca 2-3 degrees C throughout the Interstadial, interrupted by some cold oscillations (e.g. GI-lb) of 0.5-1 degrees C. The reconstructions based on both proxies are in agreement with comparable studies in the Jura Mountains and the Alps. Given the close correlation between the oxygen isotope record and the polleninferred temperatures, the discrepancies between the two biota-specific July temperature inferences could be explained by the higher sensitivity of vegetation to changes in seasonality and precipitation, whereas aquatic organisms such as chironomids are more responsive to summer season conditions.

However, the effect of phenological mismatches at wintering sites have been inadequately studied. We used long-term data to explore the consequences of water regime changes on phenological mismatch (i.e., days between arrival of geese and timing of the optimal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVIopt]) and detect the relative role of the mismatch as a driver of annual variations in abundance and distribution of the Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus (a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List) in East Dongting Lake, which is the one of this species' largest wintering sites worldwide. The NDVI of the Carex meadow (i.e., the dominant vegetation in East Dongting Lake wetland and also the major food resource for the geese) was used as the phenology metric. Results showed that the water recession pattern greatly influenced food conditions when geese arrived at the site. Early water recession led to significantly higher NDVI, whereas late water recession led to significantly lower NDVI than did the optimal water recession. However, the suitable habitat area was significantly larger under the optimal water recession pattern. Both early and late water level recessions caused greater mismatches and resulted in lower geese abundance and a more concentrated distribution. NDVI was positively correlated with aboveground biomass and negatively correlated with N% of Carex spp. High biomass and low N% related to high NDVI caused by early water recession may indicate unfavorable food conditions at the time that geese arrive and reduced sustainable food availability in mid-winter, while a low NDVI and limited habitat area caused by late water recession may indicate an insufficient food supply. In conclusion, non-optimal water recession led to a greater phenological mismatch and resulted in limited habitat quality (e.g., lower leaf N%) under early water recession but limited habitat quantity (e.g., smaller habitat area and lower aboveground biomass) under late water recession, and ultimately threatened the Lesser White-fronted Goose. Our results contributed to explaining the decline of the Lesser White-fronted Goose population in this wintering site.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022; Zhang, Siqi/GWZ-5619-2022	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2021	127								107776	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107776		MAY 2021											WOS:000659187700003

Thermocline depth and rate of seasonal thermocline deepening have decreased and the period of stable stratification has increased. These changes appear related to a long-term decline in mean winter air temperatures, which has produced cooler hypolimnetic waters and increased density gradients across the metalimnion. These changes in thermal structure have been accompanied by increases in hypolimnetic phosphorus concentrations and increased phytoplankton abundances in subsequent years. Although mean thermocline depth in the lake is intermediate relative to predictions based on surface area or fetch from published data on temperate and tropical lakes, winter air temperatures in the region have a salient impact on Lake Kinneret thermal dynamics in any given year.					; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Hambright, K.

(Portulacaceae) were examined in the field. A two-way factorial design with main factors of light treatment (ambient control irradiance vs. 90% attenuation) and nutrient treatment (unfertilized control vs. 192 kg ha-1 total N, P2O5, and K2O equivalents added) was employed at Radnor Lake, TN. Plant shading reduced biomass development, enhanced tissue nutrient concentration, and reduced both specific leaf weight and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) activity relative to unshaded controls. Fertilization enhanced aboveground nonreproductive biomass, elevated tissue nutrient concentration for N and P but not K, and increased the leaf width/length index relative to controls. Of greatest ecophysiological importance were significant light by nutrient interactions where the stimulation of both aboveground productivity and RUBISCO activity in response to fertilization occurred only for plants in unshaded, high-irradiance conditions. These results suggest that C. virginica may be nutrient limited under ambient field conditions, is not capable of acclimation to low-irradiance, that irradiance and nutrient availability interact synergistically to affect the magnitude of short-term nutrient sequestering in C. virginica biomass, and imply that total nutrient capture by the ''vernal dam'' may adjust to variation in early-season nutrient conditions to affect forest-wide nutrient conservation.																			0040-9618					APR-JUN	1993	120	2					157	165		10.2307/2996945	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2996945													WOS:A1993LM04700007

Human-induced disturbance such as hunting may influence the migratory behaviour of long-distance migrants. In 1999 and 2000 a spring hunt of greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus occurred for the first time in North America since 1916, aimed at stopping population growth to protect natural habitats. 2. We evaluated the impact of this hunt on the staging movements of geese along a 600-km stretch of the St Lawrence River in southern Quebec, Canada. 3. We tracked radio-tagged female geese in three contiguous regions of the staging area from the south-west to the north-east: Lake St Pierre, Upper Estuary and Lower Estuary, in spring 1997 (n = 37) and 1998 (n = 70) before the establishment of hunting, and in 1999 (n = 60) and 2000 (n = 59) during hunting. 4. We used multi-state capture-recapture models to estimate the movement probabilities of radio-tagged females among these regions. To assess disturbance level, we tracked geese during their feeding trips and estimated the probability of completing a foraging bout without being disturbed. 5. In the 2 years without hunting, migration was strongly unidirectional from the south-west to the north-east, with very low westward movement probabilities. Geese gradually moved from Lake St Pierre to Upper Estuary and then from Upper Estuary to Lower Estuary. 6. In contrast, during the 2 years with hunting westward movement was more than four times more likely than in preceding years. Most of these backward movements occurred shortly after the beginning of the hunt, indicating that geese moved back to regions where they had not previously experienced hunting. 7. Overall disturbance level increased in all regions in years with hunting relative to years without hunting. 8. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that spring hunting changed the stopover scheduling of this long-distance migrant and might further impact population dynamics by reducing prenuptial fattening. The spring hunt may also have increased crop damage. We propose that staggered hunt opening dates could attenuate secondary effects of such management actions.

Heavy metal concentrations in different tissues of Euryglossa orientalis, Chirocentrus nudus and sediments in Bahrekan Bay (the northwest of Persian Gulf)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Concentrations of Ni, V, Pb and Cu were determined in bottom sediments and liver, gills and fillet of Euryglossa orientalis and Chirocentrus nudus along the Bahrekan Bay in the Northwest part of the Persian Gulf in Iran. Sediment samples and fish species were collected during winter 2013 and spring 2014. Heavy metal analysis was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that mean concentrations of heavy metals were high in liver and gills of E. orientali. Also heavy metals had the most accumulation in liver of E. orientali. Target tissue for accumulation of Ni, V, Cu and Pb were gills and liver in E. orientali and C. nudus. In tissues of two fish species fillet has the minimum concentration level of trace elements. The concentrations of heavy metals were lower than legal limits in the fillet (edible part), except for Pb that was higher than permitted limits for human consumption. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were determined for different tissues of fish species with respect to elemental concentrations in sediment. Results of BAFs indicated that all BAFs in liver were more than that in gills which were higher than that in fillet. Also BAF of Cu in liver and gills of E. orientali was more than 1.

J	KOHLER, J; NIXDORF, B				KOHLER, J; NIXDORF, B			INFLUENCES OF THE LOWLAND RIVER SPREE ON PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS IN THE FLOW-THROUGH LAKE MUGGELSEE (GERMANY)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The influences of imports of nutrients and planktonic algae from the River Spree on the dynamics of phytoplankton were examined in the shallow, eutrophic Muggelsee, which has a retention time of only 42 days. Phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentrations were measured in both the lake and its inflow from 1980-1990. On a long-term average, mean biomass as well as vitality of most dominant phytoplankton populations in the lake were not significantly different from those in the river. Nevertheless, during distinct periods the external rates of biomass change of single lake populations (due to dilution or enrichment) were as high as the lake internal ones. The import of inocula populations from the river probably induced the formation of the typical community structure in the lake. Growth and decay of phytoplankton populations in the river strongly influenced the load of dissolved nutrients and thus indirectly the dynamics of planktonic algae in the downstream lake. For example, intensive assimilation of phosphorus by riverine algae in spring intensified the P-shortage and supported possible P-limitation of algal growth in the lake at that time. In years with high vernal biomass of centric diatoms in the river, and thus diminished import of dissolved silicon, the growth of diatoms was suppressed and that of cyanobacteria was favoured in the lake during summer.

Importance of unsaturated zone flow for simulating recharge in a humid climate	GROUND WATER												Transient recharge to the water table is often not well understood or quantified. Two approaches for simulating transient recharge in a ground water flow model were investigated using the Trout Lake watershed in north-central Wisconsin: ( 1) a traditional approach of adding recharge directly to the water table and ( 2) routing the same volume of water through an unsaturated zone column to the water table. Areas with thin ( less than 1 m) unsaturated zones showed little difference in timing of recharge between the two approaches; when water was routed through the unsaturated zone, however, less recharge was delivered to the water table and more discharge occurred to the surface because recharge direction and magnitude changed when the water table rose to the land surface. Areas with a thick ( 15 to 26 m) unsaturated zone were characterized by multimonth lags between infiltration and recharge, and, in some cases, wetting fronts from precipitation events during the fall overtook and mixed with infiltration from the previous spring snowmelt. Thus, in thicker unsaturated zones, the volume of water infiltrated was properly simulated using the traditional approach, but the timing was different from simulations that included unsaturated zone flow. Routing of rejected recharge and ground water discharge at land surface to surface water features also provided a better simulation of the observed flow regime in a stream at the basin outlet. These results demonstrate that consideration of flow through the unsaturated zone may be important when simulating transient ground water flow in humid climates with shallow water tables.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				JUL-AUG	2008	46	4					551	560		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00427.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00427.x								18266728					WOS:000257711400009

Sand dredging has disturbed aquatic ecosystems by affecting hydrological processes, increasing content of suspended sediments and reducing water clarity. Poyang Lake, connecting with Yangtze River in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is the largest fresh water lake in China. Sand dredging in Poyang Lake has been intensified since 2001 because such practice was banned in Yangtze River and profitable. In this study, the morphologic change caused by sand dredging in Poyang Lake basin was analysed by overlaying two DEMs acquired in 1952 and 2010 respectively. Since the reflectance of middle infrared band for sand dredging vessel is much higher than that of water surface, sand dredging vessels were showed as isolated grey points and can be counted in the middle infrared band in 12 Landsat images acquired in flooding season during 2000 similar to 2010. Another two Landsat images (with low water level before 2000 and after 2010) were used to evaluate the morphologic change by comparing inundation extent and shoreline shape. The following results was obtained: (1) vessels for sand dredging are mainly distributed in the north of Poyang Lake before 2007, but the dredging area was enlarged to the central region and even to Gan River; (2) sand dredging area reached to about 260.4 km 2 and is mainly distributed in the north of Songmen Mountain and has been enlarged to central of Poyang Lake from the distribution of sand vessels since 2007. Sand dredged from Poyang Lake was about 1.99x10(9)m(3) or 2448 Mt assuming sediment bulk density of 1.23 t m(-3). It means that the magnitude of sand mining during 2001-2010 is almost ten times of sand depositions in Poyang Lake during 1955-2010; (3) Sand dredging in Poyang Lake has alternated the lake capacity and discharge section area, some of the watercourse in the northern channel was enlarged by more than 1km when in low lake level. This study is useful to understand the change of hydrological system, especially the drying up trend in Poyang Lake in recent autumns and winters.																			2194-9034						2014	40-1						355	362		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-1-355-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-1-355-2014													WOS:000368435600053

Spatial patterns in total phosphorus from approximately 3000 lakes were studied in conjunction with maps of geographic characteristics that tend to affect phosphorus balance in lakes to identify regions of similarity in phosphorus concentrations in lakes or similarity in the mosaic of values as compared to adjacent areas. While degrees of relative homogeneity are apparent at many scales, the map was designed at a scale that would yield regions with sufficient homogeneity to be useful for lake management throughout the area. In this study, data from 210 lakes in a 1560-mi2 area in northwestern Wisconsin, sampled by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in the spring of 1988 (subsequent to the compilation of the phosphorus map), were examined to: (1) substantiate the existence of the regions depicted on the map in northwest Wisconsin, (2) determine the nature and relative precision of the regional boundaries, (3) determine the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic watershed characteristics, lake types, lake area, and lake depth in explaining within-region differences in lake phosphorus, and (4) demonstrate how the regions might be used by local lake managers.

Here, we reconstruct a 15,000-year plant cellulose delta C-13 proxy record for the ISM from the Yuexi peat bog in southwestern China. The record shows that the ISM abruptly decreases during the Younger Dryas (YD) stadial and abruptly increases during the Bolling-Allerod (BA) interstadial. A comparison of the Yuexi record with other related proxy climate records reveals two types of phenomena. First, the strengths of the two Asian monsoons are inversely related during the YD stadial, i.e., the ISM strength decreases and the EASM increases. During this period, the southern Chinese mainland consisted of a wide arid zone while the northern Chinese mainland was much wetter. The arid zone in southern China resulted from two different types of monsoon processes: the abnormal northward extension of the EASM rain belt, leading to less rainfall in southeast China, or an illusion that the EASM weakened. The other process is a real weakening of the ISM. Second, during the BA interstadial, the strengths of both the ISM and EASM clearly increased. However, the maximum strengths appear to have occurred in the Allerod period. During this period, the entire Chinese mainland, both northern and southern, experienced wet conditions. The abnormal climate pattern of wet in the north and dry in the south during the YD stadial occurs because of the combined effects of the strengthened EASM, intensified westerlies, and weakened ISM, which could be attributed to the response to the abrupt cooling in the high northern latitudes and to the El Nino-like activity in the equatorial Pacific. The widespread wet climate during the BA interstadial may be related to an abrupt increase in the greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentrations in the atmosphere and to the La Nina-like activity in the equatorial Pacific. These results contribute to a better understanding of the response of the Asian monsoon to global changes and present a geo-historical scenario for understanding the East Asian hydrological variations in the current global warming phase.

J	Zhang, JX; Lu, JJ				Zhang, JX; Lu, JJ			Feeding ecology of two wintering geese species at Poyang Lake, China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The feeding ecology of the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and the white-fronted goose (A. albifrons albifrons) overwintering at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, was studied from 1990 to 1991. The daily patterns of these geese showed differences of the activity categories between species. The energy intakes of these geese were estimated by fecal analysis, daily dropping counts, and calorie determinations. The average daily digestible energy intakes of these geese were about twice their basal metabolic rate. Roots of Vallisneria asiatica, Acorus calamus, and Cates sp. were the main food for the swan goose. The leaves of Carer sp. were the main food of the white-fronted goose. The diets of the geese do overlap with those of some other waterbirds, mainly that of the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) in Poyang Lake. This, however, is not a main reason for the decrease of the number of geese in winter in this season.																			0270-5060					DEC	1999	14	4					439	445		10.1080/02705060.1999.9663702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1999.9663702													WOS:000084518500005

Gary			Effects of rearing temperature on yolksac volume and growth rate in Lake Sturgeon, A. fulvescens, from hatch to age-1	AQUACULTURE												In fishes, differences in egg incubation and water temperature in early rearing environments can have a significant impact on phenotypic development. This is particularly relevant during the first year of life when growth rate peaks and influences an individual's life history trajectory. In the present study, we examined the effect of differences in egg incubation, water temperature and overwintering on growth in Lake Sturgeon, A. fulvescens, throughout the first year of life. Developing embryos were incubated at 12-14 degrees C supplied with flow-through water and ambient light conditions in MacDonald hatching jars or allowed to adhere to substrate. Upon hatch (-9 days post-fertilization, dpf) larvae from each incubation treatment were then transferred to 16, 18 or 20 degrees C water increasing at a rate of 0.5 degrees C.day(-1) and held at those temperatures until approximately 24 days post-hatch (dph). Experimental treatments were then transferred to a common garden set-up where duplicate treatment tanks were fed flow through river water at ambient temperature with natural light cycles. These were compared to fish transferred from a standard hatchery rearing treatment to the common garden tanks at the same time. Experimental fish were fed ad libitum twice daily throughout the growing season, but food was withheld when water temperature reached 1.5 degrees C (-6 months post-hatch, mph). Food was re-introduced at the start of spring the following year when water temperature exceeded 2 degrees C for three days in a row, (- 10.5 mph). In experimental treatments, growth rate was highest in the 20 degrees C group during the first 3 months but converged with all other experimental treatments during winter before once again exceeding the other treatments following recovery from overwintering. Our data suggest that a temperature dependent growth phenotype was fixed during the first month of life in Lake Sturgeon that could have significant implications on hatchery rearing of this endangered species for conservation purposes.																			0044-8486	1873-5622				JAN 15	2022	546								737352	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737352		AUG 2021											WOS:000729984000007

Relationships among microclimate, edaphic conditions, vegetation distribution and soil nitrogen dynamics on the Bogong High Plains, Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												We examined microclimatic conditions and soil nitrogen (N) dynamics of different alpine plant community types on the Bogong High Plains in Victoria, Australia. Three community types are predominant in the High Plains region, namely grassland, heathland and woodland and together they form so-called inverted treelines, with grassland in valley floors below the treeline. Outdoor temperature loggers were deployed in the three vegetation types to establish differences among microclimatic conditions. We incubated soils to determine rates of N production and collected additional soil samples for analysis of soil properties and soluble N. Temperature data showed that only grassland communities experienced sub-zero temperatures in winter. Temperature and soil moisture influenced indices of N mineralization and N nitrification in this alpine ecosystem. Rates of N mineralization were significantly faster than nitrification that only produced consequential amounts of nitrate in summer. This information, together with considerably lower pools of nitrate than ammonium and organic N in the soil, implies that ammonium is the dominant form of soluble N in the ecosystem whereas nitrate most likely only has minor importance for plant nutrition. The results of this study provide insight into ecological processes of this alpine ecosystem and demonstrate the vulnerability of the system to altered climatic and edaphic conditions in the course of climate change.					; adams, mark/H-1303-2012; adams, mark/H-1303-2012; Adams, Mark/H-1303-2012	Arndt, Edith/0000-0002-1850-2063; adams, mark/0000-0002-8154-0097; Adams, Mark/0000-0001-8989-508X													1442-9985	1442-9993				APR	2011	36	2					142	152		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02128.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02128.x													WOS:000288867500004

This study explored the metal binding characteristics by DOM with different MWs from different sources, including sea, river, and wetland waters. The results of fluorescence characterization showed that the >1 kDa high-molecular-weight (HMW)-DOM were mainly from terrestrial sources while the low-molecular-weight (LMW)DOM fractions were mostly from microbial sources. Based on UV-Vis spectroscopic characterization, the LMWDOM contained more unsaturated bonds than its HMW counterpart, and the substituents are generally dominated by polar functional groups. Summer DOM had more unsaturated bonds and a higher metal binding capacity than winter DOM. Furthermore, DOM with different MWs had significantly different Cu binding properties. In addition, Cu binding with microbially derived LMW-DOM mainly caused the change in the peak at 280 nm, while binding with terrigenous HMW-DOM resulted in the change of the 210 nm peak. Compared with the HMW-DOM, most of the LMWDOM had stronger Cu-binding ability. Correlation analysis indicates that metal binding ability of DOM mainly depends on its concentration, number of unsaturated bonds and benzene rings, and types of substituents during interactions. This work provides an improved understanding of the metal-DOM binding mechanism, the role of composition- and MW-dependent DOM from different sources, and thus the transformation and environmental/ecological role of metals in aquatic systems.

However, knowledge of how temperature fluctuations impact phytoplankton shift and then favor cyanobacterial growth in spring is limited. In this study, we analyzed photosynthesis and growth responses of phytoplankton species to different temperature fluctuation patterns in the laboratory. We also performed daily monitoring to detect the relationship between phytoplankton groups and diel temperature fluctuations. The results of the laboratory experiments suggested that the photosynthetic performance and growth rate of Microcystis aeruginosa were better adapted to temperature fluctuations than those of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana. Temperature fluctuations slowed the proliferation of Ch. pyrenoidosa and Cy. meneghiniana, while promoting M. aeruginosa. Moreover, the response dynamics of different phytoplankton species to diel temperature fluctuations depended on the mean temperature. The results from the field also indicated that there was a positive relationship between cyanobacterial biomass and diel temperature fluctuations. Our study offers further understanding of the effect of temperature fluctuation on phytoplankton composition shift and the formation of cyanobacterial dominance in spring.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													1322-0829	1440-1835				JUL	2019	67	3					184	191		10.1111/pre.12369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.12369													WOS:000473649500002

J	Hairston, NG Jr; Kearns, CM; Demma, LP; Effler, SW				Hairston, NG Jr; Kearns, CM; Demma, LP; Effler, SW			Species-specific Daphnia phenotypes: A history of industrial pollution and pelagic ecosystem response	ECOLOGY												Phenotypic differences among species, even closely related species, may translate into distinct effects on ecosystem dynamics. In lakes, the generalist grazer genus Daphnia often has marked effects on the abundance of primary producers, the rate of primary production, and rates of nutrient cycling. The effects are particularly distinct during the clear-water phase (CWP) when algal biomass is driven to extremely low values as Daphnia densities undergo an annual population increase. Here we show that the timing of the CWP in Onondaga Lake, New York, USA, has depended upon which Daphnia species were present in the water column. An analysis of the ephippia and diapausing eggs from the sediments reveals that long-term changes in the zooplankton species assemblage tracks a history of chemical (especially salt waste) pollution. Prior to 1930 the assemblage was dominated by native D. pulicaria and D. ambigua. From 1930 to 1980, these species were replaced by D. exilis and D. curvirostris, two salinity-tolerant exotic species native to shallow salt pools of the southwestern United States and coastal brackish ponds of Europe, respectively. As industry was progressively shut down by government action over the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, the exotic species disappeared, and the two native taxa returned (plus D. galeata mendotae, which is also native to the region). As we have shown previously, the exotic species were identified either by hatching and rearing diapausing eggs (D. exilis) or by analysis of eggs using mtDNA (D. curvirostris). We interpret their role in seasonal algal dynamics in Onondaga Lake retrospectively using data collected in prior studies of the lake. The native Daphnia currently cause a typical spring CWP in late May and early June, whereas the exotic species caused an unusual late-summer (August-October) CWP during the period of maximum cyanobacterial density.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	2005	86	7					1669	1678		10.1890/03-0784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0784													WOS:000230249600002

San Antonio Pool of the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer	EDWARDS AQUIFER: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF A VITAL WATER RESOURCE	Geological Society of America Memoir											The Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer in central Texas is typically defined as having three segments: the San Antonio, the Barton Springs, and the Northern segment, which are separated by groundwater divides or points of discharge. The San Antonio segment of the Edwards Aquifer is defined as extending from east of Brackettville in the west to Hays County in the east. The San Antonio segment has been further delineated into two pools, the San Antonio Pool and the Uvalde Pool, for water management purposes. The San Antonio Pool is the larger of the two pools and is recharged by the Dry Frio, Frio, Sabinal, Medina, Cibolo, Guadalupe, and Blanco River watersheds, in addition to direct recharge and flow from the Uvalde Pool via the Knippa Gap. To a lesser extent, interformational flow between units stratigraphically above and below the Edwards Formation limestone also occurs. The most prominent points of discharge from the San Antonio Pool are Comal, San Marcos, and Hueco Springs. San Pedro and San Antonio Springs in Bexar County discharge during periods of high stage in the aquifer. There are limited numbers of additional springs in the Frio River watershed with limited discharge. Significant water is discharged from the Medina Lake and Diversion Lake (downstream from Medina Lake dam) system via conduits and surface flow to recharge paleo-alluvial deposits (Leona Gravel) in the Medina River floodplain. This discharge had previously been assumed to recharge the Edwards Aquifer, but it continues downgradient in the Leona Gravel and is lost to the aquifer.						Bertetti, F.

In summer, blooming of Microcystis spp. resulted in low concentrations of DIC and high pH, and HCO3- was the prominent species of DIC. Chlorophyll-specific rates of photosynthesis were relatively constant irrespective of the algal biomass during summer. Carboxylation in photosynthesis of Microcystis spp. was mainly catalyzed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase). Carbon isotope discrimination between .delta.13C of phytoplankton and DIC was considerably small in early summer and appeared to be negatively correlated to DIC concentration. We concluded that carbon fixation by phytoplankton in Lake Suwa is controlled not by the switch of photosynthetic pathways, but by low DIC concentration and high pH, suggesting that photosynthesis of Microcystis spp. in Lake Suwa is governed by uptake kinetics other than the carboxylation step.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1990	12	4					799	808		10.1093/plankt/12.4.799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/12.4.799													WOS:A1990DM21200007

This study focused on two important water quality parameters, TSM (total suspended matter) and CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) in West Lake, a world famous urban scenery lake in Hangzhou, China. Based on Landsat 8 images, remote sensing inversion models for TSM and CDOM in West Lake were compared and the best ones were determined using exponential functions and green/red band ratios. Results show that the accuracy of TSM models is relatively better while CDOM models performed relatively poor, indicating that empirical estimation of CDOM for inland complex waters remains a challenge. The Landsat 8-derived results in West Lake from 2013 to 2017 show that TSM presented diverse distributions in different sections and months/seasons-the relatively high-concentration TSM was usually found in the north section and during spring festivals, holidays and summer vacations. These spatiotemporal patterns demonstrate the evidence that TSM in West Lake was highly linked to anthropogenic impacts, such as tourist visits, commercial activities, and urban drainage projects in Hangzhou. The relations between TSM and precipitation were also examined, but no significant correlations were found, showing that the impacts of rainfall on water quality of urban lakes are complicated, and using remote sensing for such studies is still with limitations. Practitioner points Water quality (TSM and CDOM) of urban scenery lakes is highly influenced by urban tourist activities. Precipitation and TSM have not found significant relations in urban scenery lakes. An exponential model based on Landsat 8's bands 3 and 4 is good for TSM estimation. CDOM estimation remains a challenge for water color remote sensing in urban scenery lakes.					sun, nan/KWT-9194-2024; Zhu, Weining/C-9978-2013	Chen, Jiang/0000-0002-7631-2591; Zhu, Weining/0000-0001-9918-4249													1061-4303	1554-7531				2019 SEP 22	2019										10.1002/wer.1240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.1240		SEP 2019						31512801					WOS:000491257900001
J	Kaushal, R; Lai, CC; Shiah, FK; Liang, MC				Kaushal, Ritika; Lai, Chao-Chen; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo; Liang, Mao-Chang			Utilization of Δ17O for nitrate dynamics in a subtropical freshwater reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Feitsui Reservoir, a freshwater body in Taiwan with minimal anthropogenic stress, meets the water demand for the population of more than five million living in Taipei city. In view of the biogeochemical processes controlling the long-term trophic status of this socio-economically and ecologically important aquatic system, probing the nitrogen cycle and its dynamics is essential. Here, we monitored the concentration and stable isotopic compositions (delta N-15, delta O-18, and Delta O-17) of nitrate in the Feitsui Reservoir and in the atmospheric wet deposition at intervals of 1-2 weeks for a year, along with measurements of environmental data such as chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, and community respiration. Emphasis was laid on Delta O-17 (= delta O-17 - 0.52 x delta O-18) because of the mass-conservative behavior of Delta O-17 during partial assimilation and denitrification. The present approach offered an effective method to quantify the gross nitrification and removal/uptake rates of nitrate in the reservoir. The atmospheric nitrate exhibited elevated Delta O-17 values ranging from 12.6 parts per thousand to 30.1 parts per thousand (23.3 +/- 5.0 parts per thousand), compared to the lower Delta O-17 values of similar to 0 to 4.6 parts per thousand (1.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) recorded in the reservoir nitrate. Utilizing Delta O-17 for dissolved nitrates, we observed a seasonal trend of higher nitrification and removal rates during the summer than in the winter. Our estimates showed annually-averaged nitrification rate of 55 +/- 11 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and removal/uptake rate of 57 +/- 11 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (or a nitrate turnover time of similar to 2.5 months), representing the active nature of nitrogen cycling in this preserved subtropical reservoir.

J	COPELAND, RS; CRAIG, GB				COPELAND, RS; CRAIG, GB			COLD HARDINESS OF TREE-HOLE MOSQUITOS IN THE GREAT-LAKES REGION OF THE UNITED-STATES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We examined cold hardiness of the overwintering stages of five species of North American tree-hole mosquitoes through laboratory experiments and field observations. Among the species that overwinter as larvae, fall-collected individuals were freeze tolerant, whereas all summer-collected larvae were killed by freezing. Cold hardiness varied among species and among larval stages within species. The order of diminishing cold tolerance was Orthopodmyia alba, Anopheles barberi, and Orthopodomyia signifera. Some O. alba larvae survived freezing -25.degree. C, the lowest temperature reported to be survived by an aquatic animal in ice. Prolonged (up to 16 days) and multiple (four) exposures to -15.degree. C had no effect on survival of O. alba third-instar larvae, but increased mortality of second instars of O. alba and A. barberi. Species were more tolerant of cold when frozen in rot-hole water in which they are commonly found in nature than in "pan" water in which they rarely occur. Both photoperiodically induced dormancy and prefreezing exposure to low temperature were necessary for the establishment of cold hardiness in laboratory-reared A. barberi. Eggs of Aedes triseriatus and Aedes hendersoni were more cold hardy than larvae of Orthopodomyia and Anopheles. Neither preconditioning to cold nor dormancy was necessary for survival at -15.degree. C for 24 h. Females that had survived temperatures at -25.degree. C as eggs showed no impairment of reproductive capability.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUN	1990	68	6					1307	1314		10.1139/z90-195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-195													WOS:A1990DP42300038

Electrogenic sulfur oxidation by cable bacteria in two seasonally hypoxic coastal systems	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Cable bacteria can reach high densities in coastal sediments, and as a result of their unusual electrogenic lifestyle and intense metabolic activity, exert a major and distinct impact on biogeochemical cycling, both locally in sediments and at the ecosystem level. This appears to be particularly true for seasonally hypoxic systems, but the driving force behind the proliferation of cable bacteria in these systems is not well understood. Moreover, the metabolism of cable bacteria induces strong acid production, which can be buffered through carbonate dissolution in sediments. A strong depletion of alkalinity in the pore water is therefore expected in carbonate-poor sediments. To evaluate the impact of cable bacteria metabolism on sediment geochemistry, we performed field sampling and laboratory sediment incubations in two seasonally hypoxic sites: one carbonate-poor site with low levels of free sulfide in pore water (Yarra Estuary, Australia) and one carbonate-rich site with high free sulfide (Lake Grevelingen, The Netherlands). Active cable bacteria populations were found in both field locations, with higher abundance and activity observed in spring compared to autumn. The sediment incubations tracked the metabolic activity of cable bacteria over time (maximum 84 days), and confirmed the fast development of an electric network (cell doubling time: similar to 19 h). These results suggest that cable bacteria are widespread in seasonally hypoxic systems, supporting previous findings. Cable bacteria acidified the sediment by > 1.5 pH units in 6-13 days (differing per site) and their activity accounted for >70% of the oxygen uptake. A clear subsurface accumulation of Fe2+ was observed after 8 days of Yarra sediment incubations, indicative of increased FeS dissolution as e-SOx developed. The increased availability of sulfide from FeS dissolution promotes a positive-feedback loop that we infer allowed for a faster development of cable bacteria in the carbonate-poor sediments. A depletion of total alkalinity was observed in the deeper Yarra sediment, whereas, a higher alkalinity efflux was previously observed in the carbonate-rich sediments from Lake Grevelingen. These results suggest a differential pH and alkalinity dynamic due to the interaction between the local carbonate content of the sediment and cable bacteria activity.

Influence of water temperature and streambed stability on the abundance and distribution of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Sculpin are small-bodied fish that exhibit limited mobility. These fish may therefore be an ideal choice as sentinel species in environmental effects monitoring as they may be more reflective of ambient local conditions than are the larcye-bodied, more wide-ranging species historicallv used in monitoring programs. This study quantified the spatial and temporal density and distributional patterns of the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatits) population in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of their response to natural environmental variability. We predicted that sculpin densities would follow a longitudinal temperature (Yradient from headwater to mouth and would be hi(yhlv sensitive to fluctuations in stream flow and substrate disturbance. Electrofishing surveys conducted twice per year from 1991 to 1998 revealed significant differences in sculpin density between years, reaches, and habitats, but not between seasons. The highest sculpin densities were found in those reaches with the coolest summer water temperature. The Middle reach in Catamaran Brook annually supported the highest sculpin density, followed by the headwater or Upper reach and then by the two lowermost reaches: Gorge and Lower. Stochastic events also influenced population dynamics. A mid-winter ice break-up (1996) and its associated flood and ice scour caused the greatest disturbance of the sculpin population, resulting in a significant density decline and a shift in the population age structure. A bedload movement experiment conducted to further assess sculpins' response to substrate stability identified greater bed stability in the Upper and Middle reaches of the brook than in the Lower reach. The pattern of sculpin distribution observed in this study is consistent with the idea that distribution and abundance of sculpin are significantly influenced by stream temperature but also, in part, by stream bed stability.

Spatial coherency of the spring flood signal among major river basins of eastern boreal Canada inferred from flood rings	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In eastern boreal Canada, long-term perspective in water resources and hydroelectric dam management is currently limited by the lack of long-term hydrological records. The research for new paleohydrological proxies would help fill this hydrological data gap and provide regional hydroclimatic predictive trajectories in the context of climate change. The development of long annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area has recently demonstrated a high potential for reconstructing high and low discharges. This study analyzes a network of 10 sites scattered around Lake Duparquet. The region covers an area of about 20 000 km(2) including four river basins characterized by natural and regulated rivers, and unflooded control sites. The objectives were to assess 1) the spatial coherency in flood-rings chronologies among sites and Lake Duparquet, and among hydrological regimes (natural, regulated and unflooded control) and 2) their degree of association with i) annually resolved chronologies of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area and number, ii) a reconstruction of the Harricana River spring discharge and iii) discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area. It was hypothesized that flood rings would be consistent among natural rivers and absent from regulated rivers. Results showed high spatial coherency among natural rivers with flood rings recording the major floods of the last 250 years. Flood ring and earlywood vessel chronologies were strongly correlated to both reconstructed and instrumental discharge data. On regulated rivers, trees were younger than at the other sites and mainly spring floods that occurred prior to dam creation and the few extreme floods after dam creation were recorded by flood rings. One hypothesis is that older trees (before dam) most likely recorded the natural dynamic of the river, while younger trees (after dam) most likely recorded dam management maneuvers and spring flood exceeding dam capacity. Flood rings and earlywood vessel chronologies provided comparable and complementary hydrological evidence. Flood rings were easily identified visually allowing fast determination of major flood years whereas developing earlywood vessel chronologies, while being more tedious and time consuming, allowed capturing a larger spectrum of hydrological conditions					NOLIN, Alexandre/AID-1797-2022	NOLIN, Alexandre Florent/0000-0003-1033-9123													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2021	596								126084	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126084		APR 2021											WOS:000642334400056
J	Zhang, WW; Shi, MJ; Huang, ZH				Zhang, Weiwen; Shi, Minjun; Huang, Zuhui			Controlling non-point-source pollution by rural resource recycling. Nitrogen runoff in Tai Lake valley, China, as an example	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE												Agricultural non-point-source (NPS) pollution is regarded as the dominant contributor to water quality degradation and eutrophication in China. Nitrogen (N) is a primary source of pollution in fresh water bodies. In this work a linear programming model was developed to simulate the effectiveness of different nitrogen runoff control policies, using Pinghu City in Tai Lake valley as an example. Four policy scenarios were tested: a tax at a rate equivalent to 50% of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer (S1); a ban on summer fertilizer applications to make the most use of fertilizer applied in the spring (S2); mandatory substitution of regular fertilizers by controlled-release fertilizers (S3); and a subsidy of US$300 ha(-1) (RMB phi 150 mu(-1)) for using compost (S4). The results indicate that all four policies would effectively reduce nitrogen runoff-by 9.8, 26.8, 14.4, and 80.0%, respectively. A subsidy for recycling domestic animal manure and utilizing compost had the most significant effect on the reduction of nitrogen runoff without reducing household income. This research suggests that measures to control agricultural NPS pollution should be combined with a policy to promote recycling of bio-resources and that financial support for NPS pollution control combined with bio-resource recycling should be regarded as one aspect of public investment in regional sustainable development.																			1862-4065	1862-4057				OCT	2006	1	1					83	89		10.1007/s11625-006-0009-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-006-0009-2													WOS:000206301800007

Yet, little is known about how groundwater flows within typical alpine geological deposits like glacial moraine, talus, and bedrock. Within the Lake O'Hara alpine watershed of the Canadian Rockies, seasonal snowmelt and rain infiltrates into a large complex of glacial moraine and talus deposits before discharging from a series of springs within a relatively confined area of a terminal moraine deposit. In order to understand the shallow subsurface processes that govern how groundwater is routed through this area, we have undertaken a geophysical study on glacial moraine and bedrock over and around the springs. From interpretations of several seismic refraction, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles, we delineate the topography of bedrock beneath moraine. Although the bedrock is generally flat under central parts of the terminal moraine, we suggest that an exposed slope of bedrock on its eastern side and a ridge of shallow bedrock imaged by ERT data underneath its western margin serves to channel deep groundwater toward the largest spring. Low-electrical-resistivity anomalies identified on ERT images within shallow parts of the moraine indicate the presence of groundwater flowing over shallow bedrock and/or ice. From coincident seismic refraction, GPR and ERT profiles, we interpret an ca. 5-m-thick deep layer of saturated moraine and fractured bedrock. Despite their relatively small storage volumes, we suggest that groundwater flowing through bedrock cracks may provide an important contribution to stream runoff during low-flow periods. The distinct deep and shallow groundwater flow paths that we interpret from geophysical data reconcile with interpretations from previous analyses of hydrograph and water chemistry data from this same area.

We investigated foraging behavior in different habitats of wintering Bewick's swans. We found that the observed feeding rate was not affected by food density but showed a negative relationship with flock size and disturbance time. Handling time had a negative relationship with food density and flock size, but a positive relationship with disturbance. Searching rate was negatively correlated with food density, flock size, and disturbance time. This provides insight into how wintering waterbirds adapt their foraging behavior in complex environments. Abstract: Perceiving how animals adjust their feeding rate under a variety of environmental conditions and understanding the tradeoffs in their foraging strategies are necessary for conservation. The Holling functional response, which describes the relationship of feeding rate and food density to searching rate and handling time, has been applied to a range of waterbirds, especially with regard to Type II functional responses that describe an increasing feeding rate with food density but at a decelerating rate as the curve approaches the asymptote. However, feeding behavior components (feeding rate, searching rate, and handling time) are influenced by factors besides prey density, such as vigilance and flock size. In this study, we aim to elucidate how Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) adopt flexible foraging strategies and vary their feeding behavior components in response to disturbance, flock size, and food density. We collected focal sampling data on the foraging behavior of swans that foraged rice grains, foxnut seeds, and tubers in paddy field, foxnut pond, and lake habitats, respectively, in Shengjin and Huangpi lakes during winter from 2016 to 2018. The observed feeding rate was not correlated with food density and displayed a positive relationship with searching rate but negative relationships with handling time, flock size, overall vigilance time, and disturbance time. Handling time was negatively correlated with food density and flock size, yet it increased with disturbance, overall vigilance time, and normal vigilance time. Searching rate was negatively correlated with food density, flock size, and disturbance time. Feeding rate was affected by the combined effects of handling time and searching rate, as well as food density and searching rate. The shape of the observed functional response could not be fitted to Holling's disc equation. However, the disc equation of the predicted feeding rate of wintering swans was found to be driven by food density. This provides insight into how wintering waterbirds adopt appropriate foraging strategies in response to complicated environmental factors, which has implications for wildlife conservation and habitat management.

It was determined that for a dramatic reduction of 37.5% in stratospheric ozone concentration, a) total photoproduction of H2O2 in Lake Ontario would only increase by 3.5%, b) spectral photoproduction of H2O2 dramatically increases by over a factor of 200 at 290 nm falling to about a factor of 6 at 300 nm, c) the enhanced ground-level UV-B radiation results in a 33% increase in its contribution to the total photoproduction of H2O2 in Lake Ontario, and d) although the increased UV-B irradiance is the primary energy source for increased formation of H2O2, the essentially non-impacted UV-A irradiance remains the dominant factor in the total formation of H2O2 Therefore, current reductions fi stratospheric ozone concentrations will have minimal effect on the photoproduction of H2O2 intake Ontario.																			0380-1330						1998	24	4					929	935		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70873-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70873-1													WOS:000078691900014

Evidence of breeding was found for 22 spp. and the 1st definite breeding records for the Melville Peninsula were obtained for glaucous gull [Larus hyperboreus], Pectoral sandpiper [Calidris melanotos] and semipalmated sandpiper [C. pusilla]. A hybrid pair of gulls (glaucous .times. herring gull [L. hyperboreus .times. L. argentatus]) also nested and this appears to be the 1st definite North American record of such a hybrid nesting. Additional breeding species (14) expected to be present, based on maps in Godfrey (1966), were not found. Average breeding bird density (35 pr .cntdot. km-2) was comparable to that on Bylot Island, but considerably higher than that measured at other High Arctic sites. Neither average breeding bird densities nor phenologies changed appreciably from year to year despite a late spring melt in 1982. In both years birds began their breeding activities as soon as suitable nesting and feeding habitat became available. A biogeographic analysis based on the occurrence of breeding birds at 25 other sites across the Canadian Arctic indicates that the avifauna at Sarcpa Lake is more similar to those of High Arctic island sites than to those of mainland sites, but includes none of the species whose ranges are mainly within the Arctic Archipelago.

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Autotrophic picoplankton (APP, <2 mu m), composed of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, play an important role in the production and transformation of organic carbon in freshwaters. Eukaryotic APP are commonly found in winter and spring, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) are regarded as significant consumers of APP. Here, we analysed the grazing impact and the growth ability of the HNF culture derived from a boreal clearwater lake on the picoalga Choricystis sp. For comparison, we used HNF monocultures of Rhynchomonas sp. and Bodo saltans flagellates with distinct feeding behaviours. In the grazing experiments, all HNF cultures ingested picoalgae and reached feeding rates between 0.08 and 0.81 cells HNF-1 h(-1). We observed large species-specific differences in grazing rate (0.97 to 1.96 d(-1)), growth rate (0.35 to 0.85 d(-1)) and final abundance of HNF (5.6 x 10(4) to 74.2 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) in the growth experiments. Surprisingly, we found an increase in picoalgal growth in the presence of a grazing HNF population. Although HNF appear to be active herbivores capable of significantly reducing APP stock, flagellates were unable to control the picoalgal population. Overall, this study demonstrates an unexpected role of HNF in microbial food webs by imposing a positive feedback on picoalgal growth through grazing.																			0948-3055	1616-1564					2011	62	1					49	59		10.3354/ame01457	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01457													WOS:000285935100005
J	Galacatos, K; Barriga-Salazar, R; Stewart, DJ				Galacatos, K; Barriga-Salazar, R; Stewart, DJ			Seasonal and habitat influences on fish communities within the lower Yasuni River basin of the Ecuadorian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We sampled lagoon, river and forest stream habitats during the rising water, wet, falling water, and dry seasons in the lowland region of the Yasuni National Reserve in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We collected 195 species, increasing the current number of species for the Napo River basin to approximately 562. The steady rate of species accumulation per sample suggests that the fish fauna is still undersampled. Lagoon, river and forest stream fish communities are highly diverse and variable, composed of common species found within several habitats, of characteristic species found throughout the year, and of seasonally migrating species. Characteristic lagoon species were mainly the curimatids Curimata vittata, Psectrogaster amazonica, Potamorhina altamazonica, P. latior and Cyphocharax plumbeus. The characins Hyphessobrycon copelandi and Hemigrammus cf. lunatus and the catfishes Nemadoras humeralis, Pimelodella sp. C and Sorubim sp. A were characteristic river species. Characteristic forest stream species included Hoplias malabaricus, Hyphessobrycon copelandi, Pimelodella sp. B and Sternopyugus macrurus. During the dry season, lagoon and river habitats had the highest number of individuals and species, as fishes were concentrated in decreasing habitat area. In contrast, stream habitats had the highest species richness and abundance during the rising water and falling water seasons. Species collected included vital food fishes and seasonal migrants. The migratory catfishes Brachyplatystoma vaillantii, Hemisorubim platyrhynchos, Platynematichthys notatus, Platystomatichthys sturio and Sorubim lima were collected during the falling water season, which suggests that these species may begin migrating earlier than expected. These findings highlight the importance of seasonality for both adequately assessing aquatic biodiversity and for developing research and conservation programs encompassing whole river ecosystems.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				SEP	2004	71	1					33	51		10.1023/B:EBFI.0000043156.69324.94	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EBFI.0000043156.69324.94													WOS:000224130800005

Three study sites located at 5,10, and 30 m from a river bank were established. From August 2014 to July 2015, samples of rainwater, river water, groundwater, bulk soil water at five soil depths (i.e. 0-30,30-60,60-90,90-120,120-150 cm), and xylem water of G. biloba, were collected and their delta O-18 and delta H-2 values were measured. Generally, the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values for xylem water, groundwater, and soil water clustered together and separated from those of river water, suggesting the possible occurrence of ecohydrological separation. However, the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) values of most xylem water were positive, indicating a mixture of different water sources. Significant correlations were observed between the contributions of precipitation, soil water, and groundwater to water uptake by G. biloba, further supporting ecohydrological connectivity rather than ecohydrological separation. G. biloba switched its major water sources from soil water at 0-60 cm depth and precipitation in the wet summer, to soil water from >90 cm depth and groundwater in the dry winter. The river water was a minor water source for G. biloba, but its contribution was comparatively greater at the site closest to the river bank. Our findings contribute to understanding of plant-soil-water relationships and the water balance, and may provide important information for investigations of nutrient sources and sinks in riparian zones. The present study suggests the need to rethink the application of ecohydrological connectivity and separation in different biomes, especially where river water and groundwater recharge each other over time.

Here, sediment and water samples were collected from four sites in Blackbird Creek, DE, a salt marsh characterized as mostly freshwater to low saline brackish (< 8ppt). Recent changes in land use resulted in increased agricultural activity, suggesting the need to develop water quality indicators in this region. To test the hypothesis that diatom community composition changes seasonally with variations in water quality parameters, sediment and water samples were collected in 2009 and 2010 for analysis. Water temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured as well as water and sediment dissolved nutrient concentrations (nitrate, ammonia, and total and reactive phosphorous). DNA was extracted from sediments and changes in diatom community composition were evaluated by amplification of 18S rRNA gene using diatom-specific primers, followed by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Shannon (H') index for TRFLP profiles ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 and Simpson (Ds) index was 0.9 which infers moderate levels of diatom species richness and high diversity in these study sites. Although there were no water quality parameters that were significantly correlated with diatom community composition as determined by TRFLP patterns, temperature was the most highly correlated (r = 0.203). Dissolved oxygen, salinity, and pH of water also had moderate but insignificant impacts on the diatom community. Further analysis of cloned 18S rRNA sequences revealed the presence of diatom taxa that tolerate wide salinity ranges, and included Navicula, Cyclotella, Thalassiosira and Skeletonema. Entomoneis sp. were also present in the spring and fall seasons. Overall, results in this study demonstrate significant differences in water qualities among the study years but little change in diatom community composition between study sites and seasons, but may serve as a baseline for future studies.																				2296-665X				JUL 2	2018	6								57	10.3389/fenvs.2018.00057	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2018.00057													WOS:000452157300001

However, few climate records reflecting these attributes are available from the marginal zones of the Asian summer monsoon. Here, we present a record of the oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates (delta(18)Ocarb) of sequential sediments from Genggahai Lake in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Isotopic analyses were performed on the fine-grained carbonate fraction (<38 mu m), mollusc shells, and stem encrustations from submerged plants. The stratigraphic variations of the delta O-18 record from the different carbonate components exhibit a remarkably similar pattern, probably reflecting the fact that delta(18)Ocarb variability was controlled primarily by changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of the lake water (delta(18)OLw). Disequilibrium effects and water temperature are precluded as major factors affecting the delta(18)Ocarb variations. Genggahai Lake is hydrologically open and characterized by a rapid discharge rate, as indicated by analysis of the hydrological setting of the lake system and by the observed significant positive correlation between delta O-18(LW) and the oxygen isotopic composition of the inflowing water (delta O-18(1)). Under such hydrological conditions, we argue that the isotopic signals of different moisture sources should be reflected in the carbonate isotopic composition. Furthermore, placing the delta(18)Ocarb record in the context of regional palaeoclimate archives, we found that the isotopic signals, particularly the negative shifts from the average values, cannot be interpreted consistently, despite a process of evaporative enrichment at the lake surface. During the early- to mid-Holocene, low delta(18)Ocarb values during 10.6-9.4 and 7.4-63 ka were associated with higher lake levels, and thus the record may have been significantly affected by a strengthened Asian summer monsoon at those times and hence by a positive moisture balance. Isotopic depletions with similar magnitudes occurred at 15-14.5, 13.8-13.3, 12.5-11.4, 5.3-4.8, 3.7-3.4, 2.8-2.3, 1.7, 1.3, and 0.6 1<a, i.e., within the Lateglacial and the late Holocene. These negative shifts in delta(18)Ocarb corresponded to lower lake-level phases, and most likely were a response to intensification of the mid latitude westerly circulation that may have transported significantly more O-18-depleted moisture to the region, compared to that from the Asian summer monsoon. Overall, our results suggest that the alternating influence of the Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies played a significant role in determining the pattern of atmospheric circulation on the northeastern QTP.

J	Barth, JAC; Veizer, J				Barth, JAC; Veizer, J			Carbon cycle in St. Lawrence aquatic ecosystems at Cornwall (Ontario), Canada: Seasonal and spatial variations	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY					Symposium 18 on Global Carbon Cycle, at the 9th Biannual Meeting of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	MAR 23-27, 1997	STRASBOURG, FRANCE	European Union Geosci				Seasonal studies of a cross section through the upper St. Lawrence River in 1995 and 1996 revealed strong biogeochemical gradients between a wetland, a creek, embayments and the main river near the city of Cornwall (Ontario), Canada. These local differences are much more pronounced than over the entire length of the main river, indicating the importance of near-shore ecosystems in the riverine carbon cycle. The aqueous pCO(2) ranged from atmospheric equilibrium to values as high as 5450 ppmV, reflecting a gradient from the Great Lakes-dominated main river to the peripheral ecosystems with active biological recycling. The isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon fits this observation, with delta(13)C(DIC) values ranging from + 2.2 to - 13.7 parts per thousand from the main river to near-shore ecosystems. Warm season samples of embayments revealed active photosynthesis, with pO(2) values up to 50% higher than those of the atmosphere, and pCO(2) below atmospheric equilibrium. While photosynthetic activity was mostly caused by phytoplankton, as indicated by chlorophyll-a up to 63.0 mg/l, an active periphyton and macrophyte community also contributed to oxygen oversaturations in the littoral zone. In situ respiration dominated in the wetland, particularly during winter and spring when dissolved organic carbon (up to 17.3 mg/l) was transformed into CO2, leading to delta(13)C(DIC) values as low as - 12.3 parts per thousand. The creek was the only ecosystem with a respiratory signal inherited from near-shore baseflow, as indicated by its delta(18)O(H2O) composition that was similar to local groundwater during peak runoff periods. Its peak DOC concentrations of 38.3 mg/l, the highest amongst the studied ecosystem, may have resulted in further enhanced respiratory activity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Andersen, DO				Andersen, Dag O.			Labile aluminium chemistry downstream a limestone treated lake and an acid tributary: Effects of warm winters and extreme rainstorms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The outlet from the limestone treated Lake Terjevann consisted mainly of well-mixed lake water (mean pH 6.1) during the ice-free seasons including the unusually warm winters of 1992 and 1993. However, during the ice-covered period acidic water (mean pH 4.8, mean inorganic aluminium (Al-i) about 160 mu g/l) from the catchment draining under the lake ice dominated. A downstream tributary was generally acid and rich in aluminium (mean pH 4.6, Al-i about 230 mu g/l). After an extreme rainstorm loaded with sea-salts cation exchange in the soil resulted in more than a doubling of the Ali concentration (reaching about 500 mu g/l). It took 3-4 months until the Ali concentration returned to pre-event levels. During the ice-covered period, the acidic outlet and tributary waters resulted in acidic conditions below the confluence (pH < 4.8, Al-i about 150 mu g/l) while during the ice-free periods the more neutral outlet water resulted in higher pH and lower Al-i concentrations (pH > 5.2, Al-i about 95 mu g/l). However, during the latter climatic conditions the water was most probably more harmful to fish due to hydrolysing and polymerizing aluminium. After the sea-salt event, the increased Ali concentration in the tributary made the zone below the confluence potentially more toxic (PH similar to 5, Al-i similar to 250 mu g/l). Expected global warming resulting in winter mean temperatures above 0 degrees C may eliminate the seasonal acidification of the outlet from limestone-treated lakes creating permanent toxic mixing zones in the confluence below acidic aluminium-rich tributaries. Besides, more frequent rainstorms as a consequence of global warming may increase the frequency of sea-salt events and the Ali concentrations in the mixing zones. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	KEAST, A				KEAST, A			THE INTRODUCED AQUATIC MACROPHYTE, MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM, AS HABITAT FOR FISH AND THEIR INVERTEBRATE PREY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The exotic macrophyte M. spicatum spread widely in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, [Canada] after 1974, dominating the 2.0-3.5 m depth zone which had previously been largely open water. In the shallows it formed beds within the species-rich native Potamogeton-Vallisneria community. Fish and prey-invertebrate abundance and distribution were compared before and after the milfoil invasion for a series of depth zones (1972 relative to 1979-1980) and in communities of M. spicatum relative to native macrophytes in the littoral zone shallows in the summer of 1980. At a depth of 2.0-3.5 m (major M. spicatum zone), there were significantly fewer bluegill but more black crappie and golden shiner in 1979-1980 compared with 1972, and significantly fewer isopods, chironomid and trichopteran larvae and ephemeropteran nymphs. Differences were greatest in late summer. Inshore and offshore from the M. spicatum zone, differences were minor, suggesting that the invader, not time, was responsible. At a 1.0-1.3 m depth in the summer of 1980, 3-4 times as many fish occurred during the daytime feeding periof in the Potamogeton-Vallisneria community than in the M. spicatum area. In the benthos, beneath the native beds, 5 major taxa of prey invertebrates were 3-7 times more abundant. The foliage of Potamogeton plus Vallisneria supported twice as many invertebrates per square meter in late summer than did M. spicatum. Insect emergences over the summer (May-Sept.) were twice as high. Up to the present, the net impact of the habitat change on the fish populations of Lake Opinicon has not been great. If in the future M. spicatum were to replace the rich native macrophyte beds in the shallows, this would be cause for concern.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1984	62	7					1289	1303		10.1139/z84-186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z84-186													WOS:A1984TF06700011

This study investigates the relationships between phytoplankton communities and environmental and meteorological factors in Wuliangsuhai Lake, a representative ecosystem in an arid and cold region of China. Using data from 25 sampling sites (April-September 2023), a generalized additive model (GAM) was employed to analyze water quality and laboratory measurements. The results showed a bimodal distribution of phytoplankton density, with peaks in July (5.33 x 106 cells/L) and August (14.90 x 106 cells/L). Green algae dominated in spring, while cyanobacteria became dominant in summer. GAM analysis revealed that temperature (TEMP) was the primary driver, explaining 20.7% of the deviance. When TEMP was examined together with other factors, the explanatory ability of the model was significantly enhanced, and finally, the model explained 57.10% of the deviance. GAM analysis also revealed that different algae species responded differently to environmental factors, with the cyanophyta-dominant species Pseudoalgae being more sensitive to TEMP and pH, whereas the chlorophyta-dominant species Chlorella was more affected by wind speed and salinity. Cyanobacteria dominance, exacerbated by warming, increases the risks of harmful algae blooms and ecosystem instability, highlighting the need for mitigation strategies in vulnerable freshwater ecosystems.

In both deep and shallow lakes, we found marked seasonality in the ratio between total N and total P (TN:TP) and in the inorganic concentrations of nitrogen (DIN), indicating that N more easily becomes a limiting nutrient as summer proceeds. TN:TP reached its lowest values of < 7 (by mass) in August in 25% of the shallow lakes. Chla generally related more strongly to TP than to TN, but at high TP concentrations TN explained more of the variability in Chla than TP. Macrophyte cover tended to decrease at increasing TN when TP was between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/l. At macrophyte cover above 20%, Chla was considerably lower compared with lakes with low macrophyte cover. We conclude that P is of key importance for the ecological quality of Danish lakes but that increased N concentrations, particularly in shallow lakes with moderate to high TP, may have significantly adverse effects on lake water quality and ecological status in summer.

J	Malm, J				Malm, J			Spring circulation associated with the thermal bar in large temperate lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												The overall circulation pattern in spring is rather specific as density-induced currents may be of significance. The density-driven circulation perpendicular to the shore can be described as consisting of two circulation cells, with a zone of convergence, referred to as thermal bar, in between. The thermal bar, which coincides with the 4 degrees C isotherm (the temperature of maximum density), inhibits horizontal water exchange, implying its practical importance. In this paper, a hydrodynamic numerical model is used to study the relative influence of wind- and density-driven currents in a large temperate lake during spring. The study shows that the general density-driven circulation is strongly dependent on the bottom topography, with a more pronounced circulation and considerable descending motions in the thermal bar zone in lakes with steep sloping bottoms. In shallow lakes, the wind-driven circulation dominates, and the effect of density-induced currents is marginal, except at locations with a drastic change in bottom depth.

A MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR SIMULATING THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN A FRESHWATER LAKE	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-MATEMATIKA I MEKHANIKA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS												The most significant chemical elements in a lake ecosystem are phosphorus and nitrogen because one of them is the limiting factor of primary production rate. The phosphorus content level in a freshwater lake is of substantive importance in prediction of phytoplankton blooms. In that regard, the problem of the development of integrative models aimed at numerical simulation of the biochemical processes of phosphorus and nitrogen limitation in am aquatic ecosystem is topical for the contemporary stage of the development of mathematical methods in problems of limnology. In this paper, a mathematical model for studying the environmental status of a freshwater lake is proposed. The model includes ten prognostic variables: nitrate, phosphate, ammonium, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton, zooplankton, small nitrate detritus, large nitrate detritus, small phosphate detritus, and large phosphate detritus. Calculations performed based on the model developed for Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal showed that during last ten days of August: - increased chlorophyll a content in the pelagic zone of the lake is localized at depths of 10-30 m; - zooplankton is concentrated in the upper 25 m layer, and its biomass grows faster in the open water area; - the decrease in nutrients is registered in the zones with high phyto- and zooplankton populations. The results obtained are in qualitative agreement with data from monitoring studies of the chemical composition of water in Lake Baikal in summer.

Topographic wetness guided dairy manure applications to reduce stream nutrient loads in Central New York, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Fall Creek Watershed in central New York, USA. Study focus: Dairy manure is commonly applied to NY, USA agricultural fields as both a crop nutrient source as well as a means of waste disposal. Managing excess manure places an economic burden on small farm operations due the prohibitive cost of existing practices and regional dominance of saturation-excess hydrology. Through a SWAT modeling exercise we evaluate the efficacy of dairy manure application following the topographic wetness index (TI) as a means of reducing non-point source agricultural nutrient runoff. Next, we examine the efficacy of amending dairy manure with chemical N as a means of reducing the rate of soil TDP accumulation. New hydrological insights: We observed that application of manure to drier pastures results in less TDP and NOX surface losses, but an undesirable increase soil TDP accumulation. Further, pastures receiving dairy manure are typically N limited during summer months, limiting plant P uptake. Manure N amendment reduced TDP accumulation and increases crop yield, but slightly increased NOX surface losses. Spreading dairy manure based on the TI concept represents a feasible path towards reduction of agricultural non-point nutrient runoff, although management strategies need to consider ways to also reduce the long-term accumulation of soil P, which could have consequences in the future that are difficult to mitigate.					; Knighton, James/I-2556-2019	Prestigiacomo, Anthony/0000-0002-9792-8600; Menzies Pluer, Erin/0000-0003-4883-8091														2214-5818				DEC	2017	14						67	82		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.11.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.11.003													WOS:000426118300006

The crystal structures and elemental compositions of the river sediment samples differed significantly before and after neutralization. This was attributed to the lime input, which also affected the Pd abundance ratio obtained by the sequential extraction procedure. Additionally, the low leachability of Pd in the sediment suggested possible difficulties in its recovery. Considering the analysis of the Pd variation in the environments, it was concluded that the Pd content in the sediment of the Shinaki dam-lake was mainly supplied by the Yukawa river water inflowing the surrounding tributary rivers and hot-spring waters before neutralization, rather than the lime input.

Whole rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios throughout the basin range between 0.7054 and 0.7281. Ratios in surface water samples differ greatly between runoff from the mainly granitic Sierra (0.7094-0.7097) and runoff from the volcanic regions (0.7054-0.7064). The ratio in Mono Lake water (0.7096) is similar to the ratios of streams from the Sierra Nevada. Springs close to the western shoreline have more radiogenic Sr ratios (0.7092-0.7100), while those on the east side have ratios (0.7081-0.7088) indicative of a mixture of water from the volcanic terrain and Mono Lake.

In this paper we report our results of the 2015 field campaign together with already published data and discuss unusual geochemical features of the whole system. Acid chloride sulfate waters discharging inside the caldera are different from hot sulfate chloride waters discharging along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. The difference is in the ratios of the main conservative components (Cl, B, Na) and a high fraction of a Ca-SO4 enriched component in the coastal springs. Another unusual feature of the system is the existence of boiling Na-Cl springs outside the caldera, between the caldera thermal fields with CI-SO4 and SO4 acid waters and Sal-CI acid-to-neutral springs along the coast. Fu-marolic and bubbling gases from the caldera are characterized by low He-3/He-4 values (similar to 3.5Ra), isotopically heavy CO2 (delta C-13 >= -2.6%.) and isotopically light methane (delta C-13:5 -40%). This is a rare case when "chemical" (C-H-O) temperatures are higher than the "isotopic" (CO2-CH4) equilibrium temperatures. Trace element hydrochemistry shows preferential congruent rock dissolution in ultra-acid steam-heated SO4 waters inside the caldera and more complicated water-rock interaction for other types of waters. The REE patterns for chloride-sulfate and sulfate chloride waters normalized by average rock show depletion in LREE caused, most probably, by co-precipitation of LREE with mineral assemblages characteristic for argillic and advanced argillic alteration. The only source of chloride in the drainage from the Golovnin caldera is the Kipyaschee Lake (CI-SO4 hot springs on the lake bottom and at its shore). Solute output from the Golovnin caldera is lower than that from the other studied volcano-hydrothermal systems of Kuril Islands (5.7 t/d of Cl and 73 t/d of SO4). Natural heat output by hot water and steam discharges is estimated as 63 +/- 20 MW. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Fuks, M; Wiejaczka, L				Fuks, Maksymilian; Wiejaczka, Lukasz			Climatic Determinants of Changes in the Ice Regime of Carpathian Rivers	QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE												The study addresses the influence of climatic conditions on changes in the ice regime of Carpathian rivers (Central Europe) over the period 1980-2020. The main objective of this study is to identify interrelationships between air temperature, water temperature, river flow, and changes in the occurrence of ice cover (IC) in mountain areas. Rivers that are not significantly influenced by human activity (i.e. seminatural) were selected for analysis. Analyses were based on data obtained from 13 hydrological stations, 7 climatological stations, and the Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series (CRU-TS) high-resolution climatological dataset. The study showed a decrease in the frequency of IC in the study area, reaching 7.25 days per decade, with the greatest changes recorded in November and February. At the beginning of the winter period (November), the decrease in the frequency of IC is mainly influenced by the increasing water temperature (by an average of 0.85 degrees C per decade), whereas in the middle of the winter period (especially February), it is influenced by the increase in discharge of the studied rivers (by 1.1 m3 per decade on average in February). Both the increase in water temperature and the increase in discharge during the winter period are due to the increase in air temperature, averaging 0.47 degrees C per decade during the winter period.

Five lakes were natural and five were reservoirs belonging to both Alpine and Mediterranean Ecoregions. The 10 lakes were sampled using the Water Framework Directive compliant standardized national protocol, which includes sampling soft sediment in the littoral, sublittoral and deep layers along transects with a grab of 225 cm(2) during spring and autumn. The application of Generalised Linear Mixed Effect Models both at the lake level and at the single station of each lake highlighted that, at the lake level, no significant correlations existed between any couple of hydro-morphological, ecological and trophic status assessments, with each metric representing a different facet of human impact on the environment. At the single site level, we found significant effects of depth on the metrics of biodiversity. The best approximation of single-site macroinvertebrates diversity among the metrics of overall lake quality was with the LHMS, but not with the BQIES. Our hypotheses that lake macroinvertebrates assemblages depend also on other potential confounding variables of habitat degradation and intrinsic differences between lakes were confirmed, with depth playing a major role. Therefore, the assessment of lakes with different depths may produce different whole-lake BQIES values, only because of the effect of depth gradient and not because of differences in lake quality.

To measure the settlement rate of these invasive mussels, seven acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipes were attached to a line in shallow water (7.7 m below the surface) since November 23, 2007; eight ABS pipes were placed on another line in deep water (13.4 m below the surface) since January 3, 2008. Quagga mussels were sampled from these pipes on March 19, May 21, July 9, October 20, and December 19, 2008. Active settlement of veligers was recorded in all sampling events. The settlement rates of quagga mussels did not differ among the two lines and the highest settlement rate was found from October 20 to December 19. Three methods were used to estimate the growth of quagga mussels in Lake Mead: caged mussels, size distribution analyses on both natural populations and mussels attached to ABS pipes. Caged mussels were held in Las Vegas Boat Harbor from July 31, 2007 to March 19, 2008, where smaller mussels grew faster than larger ones. Size distribution data on two natural populations of quagga mussels collected from Sentinel Island and Indian Canyon in 2007 also showed that the growth rates decreased significantly as mussel size increased. Shell length data of cohorts collected from the ABS pipes were also used to estimate the growth of quagga mussels. The growth patterns of quagga mussels from the two lines were quite similar with the lowest growth rates detected from late summer to early autumn. The information on settlement and growth of quagga mussels from this study can help understand their population dynamics in the western United States.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				MAR	2012	7	1			SI		7	19		10.3391/ai.2012.7.1.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2012.7.1.002													WOS:000306278200002

However, the ecological ramifications of upstream cascade reservoirs remain understudied, despite their potential influence on the Yangtze River ecosystem. The Xiangjiaba Reservoir (XJB), presents a unique case for understanding the ecological impacts of large channel-type reservoirs marked with considerable water depth and extensive runoff, which lies between the characteristics of rivers and lakes. This study delves into the phytoplankton community dynamics and associated environmental factors within the XJB. Through field surveys and laboratory analysis, we explore the drivers of phytoplankton distribution and their temporal shifts. Our findings revel significant changes in phytoplankton dominance among various phyla. Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta dominated throughout the year, while Cryptophyta prevailed in spring and Xanthophyta peaked in autumn, indicating a unique ecological feature of XJB. The reservoir's water quality was found to be moderate. The average chlorophyll-a exhibited significant spatial-temporal variations, peaking at 26 mu g/L at the mainstream-tributary confluence. Our investigation reveals a tenfold increase in algal abundance since the reservoir's inception, accompanied by a significant transition from a Bacillariophyta-dominated community to a diverse, multi-phylum system. This shift has been significantly influenced by hydrodynamic conditions, with water stratification favoring flagellated algae like Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta. Notably, differences in phytoplankton composition between XJB and the Three Gorges Reservoir were linked to the latter's pronounced vertical mixing. The slower ecological responses of the phytoplankton community to hydrodynamic changes underscore the importance of long-term, continuous monitoring to maintain the reservoir's ecological balance. Our research offers insights into the ecological impacts of reservoir construction, highlighting the role of hydrodynamics in reservoir ecosystems and aiding in understanding reservoir functioning, water quality management, and biodiversity conservation.					; Lidi, Shi/MGT-7997-2025; zhu, xinyu/HJJ-1063-2023	Sun, Jian/0000-0002-0508-7489; Lidi, Shi/0000-0001-6746-2726; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2024	641								131745	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131745		AUG 2024											WOS:001290437600001
J	Golden, HE; Boyer, EW				Golden, Heather E.; Boyer, Elizabeth W.			Contemporary estimates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the watersheds of New York State, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen (N) to ecosystems are a particular concern in the northeastern USA, including New York State, where rates of atmospheric N deposition are among the highest in the nation. We calculate the seasonal and annual spatial variations of contemporary inorganic atmospheric N deposition loading to multi-scale watersheds across New York State using numerous monitoring datasets of precipitation and ambient atmospheric N concentrations. Our models build upon and refine previous efforts estimating the spatial distribution of N deposition. Estimates of total inorganic wet deposition (NH4- N + NO3-N) across New York ranged from 4.7 to 10.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) under contemporary conditions (averaged 2002-2004), and both seasonal and annual predicted rates of inorganic N deposition (NH4-N, NO3-N, and total) fit relatively well with that of observed measurements. Our results suggest that "hot spots" of N deposition are, for the most part, spatially distributed according to geographic positions (i.e., relative location from sources and the Great Lakes system) and elevation. We also detect seasonal variations in deposition, showing that total wet atmospheric inorganic N deposition inputs to watersheds (extracted from the four-digit HUC calculations) are highest during the spring (mean = 2.4 kg ha(-1), stddev = 0.29) and lowest during the winter months (mean = 1.4 kg ha(-1), stddev = 0.23). Results also suggest that wet NO3- consistently comprises a slightly higher proportion of wet N deposition than wet NH4+ throughout watersheds of New York, ranging from 2.5 to 6.1 kg NO3-N ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to NH4+, which ranges from 2.2 to 4.4 kg NH4-N ha(-1) yr(-1).					; Boyer, Elizabeth/D-6617-2013	Golden, Heather/0000-0001-5501-9444; Boyer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4369-4201; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2009	155	1-4					319	339		10.1007/s10661-008-0438-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0438-8								18712614					WOS:000267887000025

Middle Bronze Age humidity and temperature variations, and societal changes in East-Central Europe	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Archaeological evidence points to substantial changes in Bronze Age societies in the European-Mediterranean region. Isotope geochemical proxies have been compiled to provide independent ancillary data to improve the paleoenvironmental history for the period of interest and support the interpretation of the archaeological observations. In addition to published compositions, in this study we gathered new H isotope data from fluid inclusion hosted water from a stalagmite of the Trio Cave, Southern Hungary, and compared the H isotope data with existing stable isotope and trace element compositions reported for the stalagmite. Additionally, animal bones and freshwater bivalve shells (Unio sp.) were collected from Bronze Age archaeological excavations around Lake Balaton and their stable C and O isotope compositions were measured in order to investigate climate changes and lake evolution processes during this period. The data indicate warm and humid conditions with elevated summer precipitation around 3.7 cal ka BP (Before Present, where present is 1950 CE), followed by a short-term deterioration in environmental conditions at about 3.5 cal ka BP. The environment became humid and cold with winter precipitation dominance around 3.5 to 3.4 cal ka BP, then gradually changed to drier conditions at similar to 3.2 cal ka BP. Significant cultural changes have been inferred for this period on the basis of observations during archaeological excavations. The most straightforward consequences of environmental variations have been found in changes of settlement structure. The paleoclimatological picture is well in line with other East-Central European climate records, indicating that the climate fluctuations took place on a regional scale.

Water velocity modeling can delineate nearshore and main channel plankton environments in a large river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Methods to distinguish nearshore and main channel ecosystems within large rivers are essential for observing physical, chemical, and biological features that influence overall river ecosystem function. Water velocity fields based on hydrodynamic modeling of water flow trajectory were used to evaluate water history (i.e., water moving slowly as in a slack water region, or more rapidly, as characteristic of the main channel) prior to passing a given point in the Upper St. Lawrence River. Using this method to differentiate zones in the river, observations of biotic and abiotic variables in nearshore and main channel zones during late spring and summer (June-August) were compared to assess the difference in these water column river ecosystems. Differences in plankton community composition between nearshore and main channel waters along the Upper St. Lawrence River were investigated to test the hypothesis that nearshore and main channel environments in large river systems have different biotic (e.g., phytoplankton, crustacean zooplankton, and rotifer concentrations) and abiotic [e.g., water temperature, specific conductivity, silicate, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and total phosphorus] characteristics. Nearshore water had significantly higher concentrations of CDOM and chlorophyll-a than main channel waters.

The Tengger Desert (TD), a major desert situated to the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau and to the northwest of the CLP, on the western margin of the present-day Asian Summer Monsoon domain, is an ideal area for assessing which of these potential dust source areas may be dominant. A 104-m-long drill core (BJ14) was obtained from the northwestern TD. The magnetostratigraphy, constrained by electron spin resonance dating in the upper part of the core, includes the Brunhes, Matuyama and beginning of the Gauss polarity chrons, with their boundaries at the depths of 44.57 m and 94.31 m, respectively. Sedimentary facies analysis based on lithological, grain-size, magnetic susceptibility and micropaleontological evidences indicates that the core is primarily composed of lacustrine deposits. Combined with the results of previous studies in the eastern TD and the adjacent regions, the sedimentary sequence of core BJ14 indicates that lakes occupied the northern and eastern TD during most of the early Pleistocene and that the onset of a desert environment occurred at similar to 0.9 Ma. Our results suggest that the TD may have contributed only a limited amount of dust to the CLP during the early Pleistocene. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This isotopic shift resulted from large seasonal changes in the pathways of methane production. On the basis of mass balance calculations, the delta(13)C value of methane from CO2 reduction (average = -71.4 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand) was depleted in C-13 compared to that produced from acetate (-44.4 +/- 8.2 parts per thousand). The dissolved methane at the site remained heavy (approximately -51 parts per thousand) during most of the year. Tracer experiments using C-14-labeled CO2 indicated that during January 110 +/- 25% of the methane was produced PY CO2 reduction. Because of low-methane production rates during the winter, this C-13-depleted methane had only a slight effect on the isotopic composition of the methane pool. In early spring when peat temperatures and methane production rates increased, the delta(13)C value of the dissolved methane in shallow peat was influenced by the isotopically light methane and approached -61 parts per thousand. Feat incubation experiments conducted at 15 degrees C in May and June (when the peat reaches its maximum temperature) indicated that an average of 84 +/- 9% of the methane production was from acetate and had an average delta(13)C value of -48.7 +/- 5.6 parts per thousand. Rising acetate concentrations during April-May (approaching 1 mmol L-1(mM)) followed by a rapid decrease in acetate concentrations during May-June reflected the shift toward methane production dominated by acetate fermentation. During this period, dissolved methane in shallow peat at the site returned to heavier values (approximately -51 parts per thousand) similar to that produced in the incubation experiments.

In contrast to other tree species and economically important species in Croatia European beech has the largest areal and can be found in variety of plant communities. As the most specious and widely distributed mammalian group, rodents are the wildlife reservoir for many zoonoses which can infect humans and other wildlife. Rodent outbreaks tend to follow years with increased seed production of oak and beech. Many authors have linked fluctuations in abundance of rodent reservoirs with increase of human zoonotic infections. Aim of this research is monitoring of rodent populations and hantaviruses in beech forests. At two locations (National park Plitvice lakes and Nature park Medvednica) seven trapping plots were set, each containing 1 or 2 grids size 100m x 100m (100 traps). Rodent capturing was done from year 2011 until 2014 in summer and autumn. Beech mast was recorded in NP Plitvice lakes each year in autumn. Trapped rodents were screened for hantaviruses. Results show two dominant rodent species, yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in beech forests of NP Plitvice and NP Medvednica. Both species make 99 % of total captures. Rodent abundance showed increase in year 2012 and outbreak in year 2014 measuring on one grid max abundance of 45 animals/ha, whereas year 2011 and 2013 had lowest abundance. In beech forests of National Park Plitvice lakes and Nature Park Medvednica 3 different hantaviruses were found within their typical rodent host species: Puumala (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), hantavirus Dobrava (DOBV) in yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and Seewis (SWSV) in common shrew (Sorex araneus) which makes first molecular evidence of shrew-borne Seewis virus in Croatia. Highest infection rate was found in bank voles with 50 % of Puumala positive individuals. Do brava was found in 5 % of trapped yellow-necked mouse. In 2011 there was slight increase in beech seed production reported in comparison to year 2012 and 2014. In year 2013 beech seed production was the highest with mean beech seeds/m(2) 23x higher than in year 2012. From the rodent abundance and beech mast data we see the trend of mast years being followed with high rodent abundance. Highest proportion of hantavirus positive rodents was found in year 2014 when their abundance was also reported highest. From this data the connection of beech mast year and rodent abundance following next year as well as high infection rates of rodents is confirmed. In same years with increased rodent abundance there was high number of human HFRS cases (hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome).

J	Heiri, O; Tinner, W; Lotter, AF				Heiri, O; Tinner, W; Lotter, AF			Evidence for cooler European summers during periods of changing meltwater flux to the North Atlantic	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We analyzed fossil chironomids (nonbiting midges) and pollen in two lake-sediment records to reconstruct and quantify Holocene summer-temperature fluctuations in the European Alps. Chironomid and pollen records indicate five centennial-scale cooling episodes during the early- and mid-Holocene. The strongest temperature declines of approximate to1degreesC are inferred at approximate to10,700-10,500 and 8,2007,600 calibrated C-14 years B.P., whereas other temperature fluctuations are of smaller amplitude. Two forcing mechanisms have been presented recently to explain centennial-scale climate variability in Europe during the early- and mid-Holocene, both involving changes in Atlantic thermohaline circulation. In the first mechanism, changes in meltwater flux from the North American continent to the North Atlantic are responsible for changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, thereby affecting circum-Atlantic climate. In the second mechanism, solar variability is the cause of Holocene climatic fluctuations, possibly triggering changes in Atlantic thermolhaline overturning. Within their dating uncertainty, the two major cooling periods in the European Alps are coeval with substantial changes in the routing of North American freshwater runoff to the North Atlantic, whereas quantitatively, our climatic reconstructions show a poor agreement with available records of past solar activity. Thus, our results suggest that, during the early- and mid-Holocene, freshwater-induced Atlantic circulation changes had stronger influence on Alpine summer temperatures than solar variability and that Holocene thermolhaline circulation reductions have led to summer-temperature declines of up to 1degreesC in central Europe.

The input and output of heat in an ice-covered lake provide the basic dynamic force driving changes in the biochemical state of the lake. Based on the heat balance between the lake surface and the atmosphere, we established a thermodynamic model for calculating the thermodynamic factors of shallow inland lakes during the ice and open seasons. The data of the Ulansuhai Lake, Inner Mongolia, from two years (2012 and 2013) are used to analyze the seasonal characteristics and associated influences of the heat budget on the ecosystem. The results indicated that the monthly mean lake temperature over the past 10 years was 1.7-2.2 degrees C lower than in the previous 50 years. The absorbed solar radiation reached up to 210 W/m(2) in 2012 and 179 W/m(2) in 2013, and there were clear differences in the heat budget between the ice-covered and open seasons. The mean net heat fluxes in the ice season were -33.8 and -38.5 W/m(2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively; while in the open season water, these fluxes were 62.5 and 19.1 W/m(2). In the simulations, the wind was an important factor for intensive evaporation in summer and the main driver of the ice cover formation patterns in winter, involving the transmission and diffusion of material and energy in the lake. The results provide a theoretical foundation for simulating ice cover growth and ablation processes in shallow lakes. They also present data on the ecological evolution in these lacustrine environments.					; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017; Yang, Yongfeng/I-7680-2016; Wang, Weiliang/N-3392-2018	Yang, Fang/0000-0002-9861-8487; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564; Merkouriadi, Ioanna/0000-0002-1878-3731; Rui, Cen/0000-0001-9554-5123; 														2071-1050				SEP	2020	12	18							7832	10.3390/su12187832	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187832													WOS:000584319200001

Drivers of walleye recruitment in Minnesota's large lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish recruitment is complex and difficult to predict. Data-driven approaches show promise for predicting recruitment and understanding its drivers. We used a random forest model to infer relationships between year-class strength and 17 variables describing potential recruitment drivers across 30+ years of walleye (Sander vitreus) data from Minnesota's nine largest inland lakes. Our model explained 20% of the variation in year-class strength overall, with predictive performance varying among lakes (-8% to 37% explained variance). Of the variables analyzed, degree-days during the first year of life and first winter severity were the most important for predicting recruitment, with relatively weak year classes predicted to occur with cold first growing seasons and severe first winters. Other thermal variables were secondarily important predictors of year-class strength. Predicted year-class strength was positively related to stock size and stocking and negatively related to the presence of invasive species; however, these variables were less important than thermal variables. Our results indicate that thermal conditions in early life can have a substantial impact on walleye recruitment and highlight the potential for differing recruitment drivers and dynamics among lakes.

J	KALLIO, K				KALLIO, K			EFFECT OF SUMMER WEATHER ON INTERNAL LOADING AND CHLOROPHYLL-A IN A SHALLOW LAKE - A MODELING APPROACH	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effect of weather on the eutrophication of a shallow lake was estimated by a hydrodynamic lake model coupled with a simple water quality module. The model was applied to Lake Villikkalanjarvi in southern Finland. This shallow, agriculturally loaded lake may stratify during warm and calm periods in summer and as a result oxygen is often consumed from the hypolimnion, causing high internal loading of phosphorus. Vertical mixing and temperature distribution in the lake were simulated by a one-dimensional, horizontally integrated hydrodynamic model. State variables included in the water quality model were dissolved reactive phosphorus, chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. The model was first calibrated against observations from 1989 and 1990. Thereafter, simulations were carried out using weather data from the years 1961 to 1988. The results indicated that warm summer periods may cause high chlorophyll a concentrations due to high internal loading. In four years with exceptionally warm summers the model predicted maximum chlorophyll a concentrations almost twice as high as in years without remarkable internal loading. The model simulates accurately temperature and mixing but the reliability of water quality predictions could be improved by adding more factors regulating algal biomass and sediment phosphorus release.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						371	378		10.1007/BF00026727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026727													WOS:A1994NB19800034

The primary food items, assessed with the Relative Importance Index, eaten by northern pike were common carp (Cyprinus carpio), crappies (Pomoxis spp.), and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Common carp were eaten in midsummer and winter. Crappies were eaten primarily in the winter. Fathead minnows were an important food source throughout the year. Macroinvertebrates were consumed by northern pike up to 600 mm throughout the open-water months. Northern pike in the smaller length groups (401-500 mm, 501-600 mm) ate primarily fathead minnows, juvenile common carp, and macroinvertebrates. Diets of larger northern pike consisted primarily of larger common carp, juvenile crappies, leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and occasionally walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum).

J	Inoue, J; Okuyama, C; Takemura, K				Inoue, Jun; Okuyama, Chikako; Takemura, Keiji			Long-term fire activity under the East Asian monsoon responding to spring insolation, vegetation type, global climate, and human impact inferred from charcoal records in Lake Biwa sediments in central Japan	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Records of sedimentary charcoal provide fire histories for assessing the relationship between fires and climate conditions, vegetation, human impact, and other factors. We analyzed charcoal particles in sediments from Lake Biwa in central Japan, dating back to 150,000 years ago. The sediments are well dated, homogenous, and had a constant sedimentation rate, making them ideal for assessing the long-term fire history through charcoal concentration analysis. Low charcoal concentrations in the glacial periods of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 and 6 indicate that few fires occurred in the periods under the cold climatic conditions. Variations in the microcharcoal concentration between 40,000 and 130,000 years ago, with a periodicity of 21,000-23,000 years, correspond to variations in the spring insolation in central Japan, vegetation type, and global climate, suggesting that the long-term fire activity in central Japan was determined mainly by spring insolation and vegetation type under the influence of global climate change. This finding suggests that insolation changes induced by precession cycles could influence a long-term phenomenon in an area as a direct local effect. Between 16,000 and 3000 years ago, sediments were characterized by an extraordinarily high concentration of large charcoal particles (>50 mu m) and the predominance of elongated charcoal particles, suggesting that grassland fires (presumably anthropogenic) occurred frequently in the lakeside area. The frequent fire occurrence presumably contributed to the inflow of a large amount of organic materials, resulting in changes in the aquatic environment of Lake Biwa and/or its adjacent area.

The offshore tsunami wave has the non-negligible energy and destruction in enclosed basins as fjords, reservoirs, and lakes, which are worth studying. The initial submergence condition, the falling height and sliding angle of slider, are important reference indexes of damage degree of landslide and may also matter at that of the landslide-induced tsunami. Depending on the fully coupled model, the effects of them on the production and propagation of the tsunami were considered in the study. Since the slider used was semi-elliptic, the effect of the ratio of the long axis to the short axis was also analyzed. According to the computational fluid dynamics theory, a numerical wave tank was developed by the immersed boundary (IB) method; besides, the general moving-object module of slide mass was also embedded to the numerical tanker. The results indicate that the effects of the squeezing and pushing of the slider on water produce a naturally attenuated wave at the front of the wave train, and the attenuation becomes more serious with the increase in the initial submersion range of the slider. The effects of the vertical movement of the slider cause the increase in the amplitude of the back of the wave train. As the falling height increases, the large wave height increases when the slider is initially submerged and decreases when it is not initially submerged, except for the accidental elevation of that at smaller falling heights. The results also indicate that the hazard of the subaerial landslide-induced tsunami is greater under a small or large falling angle, and that of the partial subaerial and submarine landslide-induced tsunami is greater under a small falling angle. With the increase in the ratio of the long axis to the short axis, the total induced wave energy decreases and the shape of the wave train proportionally reduces, while the wave propagation mode does not change.					; Wang, Yang/HRC-8878-2023	Zhao, Enjin/0000-0002-0584-6422; 														2076-3417				AUG	2020	10	16							5579	10.3390/app10165579	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10165579													WOS:000564909000001

Feeding, growth, density, and wintering of trout living in streams running into and out of lakes in two Norwegian water courses were compared. In the outlet streams zooplankton and filter feeders were important food items, whereas in the inlet streams, surface insects were the most important food during the ice-free season. In the Osen water course, where migration between outlet stream and lake was prevented, fish growth and density was higher in the outlet than in the inlet stream. In the Voss river course, where the trout freely migrated between outlet, lake, and inlets, the trout density was higher in the outlet than in the inlet streams, especially during winter. No growth differences were observed.																			0003-9136					MAR	1987	109	1					39	48																WOS:A1987G818100003

The ''new'' production rate was estimated from the decrease in nitrate in the euphotic zone; during this period (91 days) it was estimated as 93 mg atoms m-2, and accounted for 20% of the ''total'' PN production (460 mg atoms m-2). This implies that .apprx. 80% of the PN produced might be recycled in the euphotic zone. The increase in PN in the euphotic zone during this period (27 mg atoms m-2) accounted for 5.9% of the ''total'' PN production. This indicates that the remaining 14% of PN produced in the euphotic zone was vertically transported. Sediment trap experiments at 30 m depth indicate 8.1% of the PN produced in the euphotic zone was measured as downward flux at 30 m depth during the stagnation period. Decompositional loss of PN between 12.5 (bottom of the euphotic zone) and 30 m depth was estimated as 17 mg atoms m-2. This was calculated on the basis of accumulation of ammonium, which accounted for 3.7% of the ''total'' PN production. The flux from the euphotic zone thus accounted for 12% of the ''total'' PN production, suggesting the validity of the production model.

Analysis of silk pad types on artificial substrates showed that moderate velocity substrates were slightly more favourable for simuliid larvae as landing attachment site, while they strongly preferred high velocity substrates as wandering attachment sites and exclusively as long term attachment sites for feeding. Although silk covered only 0.78 % of surface area on glass slides, it accumulated 17 % of diatoms and 56 % of individual calcite crystals under moderate velocity conditions and 13 % of diatoms and 41 % of individual calcite crystals under high velocity conditions. This strongly suggests that simuliid silk pads influence periphyton development and serve as biomediator in early stages of tufa formation. SEM analysis has revealed diatoms on the silk with micrite on their mucus strands, indicating diatom synergistic role in tufa deposition. Diatom and calcite densities were mainly functions of time, with higher densities of both under moderate velocity conditions. Maximum dimension of calcite crystals was not affected by the two-month time of exposure, with larger crystals found under moderate velocity. We conclude that tufa deposition during the winter season was controlled primarily by trapping and binding microcrystalline calcite.

The situation is particularly acute for the period before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of speleothems from Lobatse II Cave in southeast Botswana provide the first continuous palaeoclimatic data for the region, indicating a general decrease in temperature from 50,000 yr BP to the LGM, and episodes with increased rainfall at 49,000, 47,000, 27,000, 25,000 and 23,500 yr BP. The stable carbon isotope record suggests that a significant proportion of the rainfall was of cyclonic origin. Discrepancies between the uranium and radiocarbon series dating of the speleothems suggest that much of the presently available C-14 based data may be inaccurate. However, by adjusting the U-series data from Lobatse to existing information a correlation between winter rainfall episodes in the southeast Kalahari and low lake levels in the middle Kalahari is obtained. This would support a climatic model involving the enhancement of the Southern Oscillation, and an equatorwards displacement of the subtropical convergence. Studies of cores from Lebatse Pan in the southeastern region suggest cycles of accumulation and deflation of pan sediments that would fall within the span of these climatic oscillations.																					90-5410-597-6				1998							305	313																WOS:000073252100028

In older, more eutrophic lake ecosystems like Tjeukemeer and IJsselmeer, where macro-invertebrates occur in low densities, 0-group pikeperch generally exhibit differential growth of fast-growing piscivores and slow-growing zooplanktivores. The size distributions of such cohorts become positively skewed during their first summer and often become bimodal at the end of the growing season with modes at ca. 10-15 cm and 6-8 cm respectively. The size attained by zooplanktivorous 0-group perch in these systems is relatively small (6-9 cm) and is positively related to summer temperature. Cohorts of perch in these systems shift to piscivory, partially or totally, in their second or third summer. The differential growth of zooplanktivorous and piscivorous perch of the same cohort can cause a broadening and a positive skewness in the cohort size distribution, but never results in a bimodal size distribution. In the recently freshened, mesotrophic Volkerak ecosystem, the initial high availability of the macro-invertebrate Neomysis integer, in the first couple of years enabled 0-group pikeperch and perch to reach similar large sizes of 12-14 cm and to both switch to piscivory in their second summer. After ca. 5 years Volkerak became more eutrophic, the stock biomass of cyprinids increased, the size distribution of 0-group pikeperch became bimodal and the 0-group perch stayed small (< 10 cm), as in the older, more eutrophic systems. It is postulated that more productive systems with a higher fish biomass, but with lower biomasses of macro-invertebrates and less large-sized zooplankton probably have stronger selection mechanisms for recruiting percids.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					495	506																WOS:A1996WB44500027
J	Ranta, E; Lindstrom, K				Ranta, E; Lindstrom, K			Fish yield versus variation in water quality in the lakes of Kuusamo, northern Finland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Our goal was to ascertain whether fish yield differences (0.2-43 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) among 166 Northern Finnish lakes could be attributed to level and variability of 14 limnological variables. Water quality variables were assessed at shallow and deep water in winter and summer. For most of them, the greatest share of the variation (65%) was due to the season, while that of the water depth averaged 28%. Fish yield tends to increase with increasing levels of oxygen saturation, conductivity, Na and K concentrations. A decreasing fish yield was observed with an increasing chemical oxygen demand of lake water and with increasing N. Intermediate levels of water colour were associated with the highest fish yield. A variable variability accounted for a fair proportion of the total variance in the fish yield together with a variable level only in the chemical oxygen demand of the lake water. For most of the variables examined for variability, no clear covariation with the fish yield could be shown. We selected 25 lakes with the lowest fish yield (mean 0.4 kg), and 25 lakes with the highest yield (20 kg). The 14 variables were compared in the two groups of lakes. We found that the oxygen saturation, conductivity and pH were significantly higher in the high-yield lakes than in the low-yield lakes, whilst Fe levels were much lower in the high-yield lakes. We conclude that water quality affects the lake-specific fish yield. The relationship in Finnish lakes is, however, too weak to enable the usage of water quality as a lake-specific fish yield prediction tool.

In October, Rhyacodrilus spp. began to return to the upper layer and immediately attained sexual maturity. They tended to show reduced body weight and respiratory activity during summer. The results indicate that an oligochaete of Rhyacodrilus spp. estivated in the deeper layer during summer. The estivation ostensibly occurred at 15-degrees-C and the species died off at 20-degrees-C, so it is evident that they must migrate from the surface to the deeper layer of sediment during summer in order to escape high temperature. Furthermore, physiological experiment suggested that this behavior is accelerated by low oxygen concentration with high temperature.																			0906-7590					JUL-SEP	1992	15	3					328	333		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00043.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00043.x													WOS:A1992JM78800012

As part of an ongoing collaborative modeling research program in the river system, researchers conduct annual interviews with key local water managers to characterize local climate adaptation strategies and implementation barriers, and identify science information needs to prioritize ongoing research activities. This article presents new findings from a third wave of interviews conducted with the same water managers following the historic 2017 wet year. Comparison of these data suggests that managers increased their adaptation efforts described during previous consecutive drought years (2015 and 2016). In 2017, comparatively fewer managers described climate uncertainty as an implementation barrier, exemplifying recent hydroclimate variability as the "new normal" climate for which they should plan. An assessment of recent conditions reveals that recent water years bound historical observations and are consistent with estimated paleoclimate extremes in terms of magnitude, but not persistence, of both dry and wet conditions. Comparison to projected future climate conditions affirms managers' perspectives that increased hydroclimate variability, inclusive of drought and flood extremes, defines the new normal climate anticipated for the region. To support long-term adaptation planning, managers requested that researchers prioritize simulations of alternative water management strategies that account for nonstationary climate patterns and quantify implications system-wide. This article illustrates how interdisciplinary research that integrates local knowledge with applied climate science research can support adaptive water management in snow-fed river systems.

Continental climate in the East Siberian Arctic during the last interglacial: Implications from palaeobotanical records	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												To evaluate the consequences of possible future climate changes and to identify the main climate drivers in high latitudes, the vegetation and climate in the East Siberian Arctic during the last interglacial are reconstructed and compared with Holocene conditions. Plant macrofossils from permafrost deposits on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island, New Siberian Archipelago, in the Russian Arctic revealed the existence of a shrubland dominated by Duschekia fruticosa, Betula nana and Ledum palustre and interspersed with lakes and grasslands during the last interglacial. The reconstructed vegetation differs fundamentally from the high arctic tundra that exists in this region today, but resembles an open variant of subarctic shrub tundra as occurring near the tree line about 350 km southwest of the study site. Such difference in the plant cover implies that, during the last interglacial, the mean summer temperature was considerably higher, the growing season was longer, and soils outside the range of thermokarst depressions were drier than today. Our pollen-based climatic reconstruction suggests a mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWA) range of 9-14.5 degrees C during the warmest interval of the last interglacial. The reconstruction from plant macrofossils, representing more local environments, reached MTWA values above 12.5 degrees C in contrast to today's 2.8 degrees C. We explain this contrast in summer temperature and soil moisture with a combination of summer insolation higher than present and climatic continentality in arctic Yakutia stronger than present as result of a considerably less inundated Laptev Shelf during the last interglacial.

J	Jamali, M; Gohari, A; Motamedi, A; Haghighi, AT				Jamali, Mohammad; Gohari, Alireza; Motamedi, Armita; Haghighi, Ali Torabi			Spatiotemporal Changes in Air Temperature and Precipitation Extremes over Iran	WATER												In this study, a comprehensive trend analysis was employed to study the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation characteristics with air temperature increasing over time. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the quantile regression methods were applied to detect the plausible temporal trends in 11 extreme rainfall indices and three air temperature indices employed in this study. The results showed there was little evidence to suggest that increases in the maximum of 3-h and 24-h precipitation at higher temperatures resulted in similar increases in the annual precipitation, with most stations throughout Iran showing drying features with higher temperatures. Generally, most regions over Iran scaled negatively, implying a reduction in the annual precipitation ranging from -2.64 to -0.44 mm/degrees C at higher temperatures. The linear tendencies of the maximum 24-h precipitation ranged from -0.4 to 0.23 mm/degrees C. The annual precipitation of the stations located at Urmia Lake, Caspian Sea, and the Eastern Border Basins showed a decreasing trend (-3.70 to 1.11 mm/year), while the number of rainy days increased (-2.78 to 4.72), which showed the occurrence of lighter rainfall in these regions. The increasing trend in the maximum 24-h precipitation over Western and Central Iran implied a higher probability of extreme precipitation with a higher intensity. This study revealed that the shift in precipitation extremes shifted from fall to winter by increasing the elevation, but these effects have no statistical significance in Iran.					; Haghighi, Ali/AAE-6862-2021	Jamali, Mohammad/0000-0002-9564-4049; 														2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3465	10.3390/w14213465	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213465													WOS:000885860000001

Dynamics of pelagic and benthic microalgae during drought conditions in a shallow estuarine lake (Lake St. Lucia)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Microalgae are an important component of highly productive estuarine food webs worldwide. Due to their short generation times, they are able to respond quickly to changing environmental conditions and grazing pressures. We studied the dynamics of microalgae in Lake St. Lucia, a shallow estuarine lake system, and one of the largest estuaries in Africa. Recently, dry years in addition to the closure of the inlet in 2002 have left Lake St. Lucia with greatly reduced water levels and increased salinities. We sampled planktonic and benthic microalgal biomass (chl a) and physico-chemical parameters biweekly at three different stations located at the inlet, the southern, and the northern reaches of the system from October 2010 until September 2011. Microalgal biomass differed significantly between sites but did not show clear seasonal patterns. Stochastic climate phenomena had a larger influence than the seasonal cycle. However, the different sites were subject to different driving factors. Erratic rainfall led to rapid and large changes in salinity with most rain falling in summer 2010/2011. During long periods without rain, evaporation led to increasing salinities. In False Bay, in the northern reaches of Lake St. Lucia, this alternation of rainfall and evaporation additionally influenced algal biomass by dilution and concentration. This was not observed in the southern reaches and the inlet of the lake system where trophic interactions most likely played an important role in influencing microalgal dynamics. Although it was not possible to identify general patterns of microalgae dynamics for the entire system, the drivers at individual sites could be identified. Lake St. Lucia corresponded to the in general stochastic nature of microalgae dynamics found in systems worldwide, and in addition showed strong spatial heterogeneity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Damer, B; Deamer, D				Damer, Bruce; Deamer, David			The Hot Spring Hypothesis for an Origin of Life	ASTROBIOLOGY												We present a testable hypothesis related to an origin of life on land in which fluctuating volcanic hot spring pools play a central role. The hypothesis is based on experimental evidence that lipid-encapsulated polymers can be synthesized by cycles of hydration and dehydration to form protocells. Drawing on metaphors from the bootstrapping of a simple computer operating system, we show how protocells cycling through wet, dry, and moist phases will subject polymers to combinatorial selection and draw structural and catalytic functions out of initially random sequences, including structural stabilization, pore formation, and primitive metabolic activity. We propose that protocells aggregating into a hydrogel in the intermediate moist phase of wet-dry cycles represent a primitive progenote system. Progenote populations can undergo selection and distribution, construct niches in new environments, and enable a sharing network effect that can collectively evolve them into the first microbial communities. Laboratory and field experiments testing the first steps of the scenario are summarized. The scenario is then placed in a geological setting on the early Earth to suggest a plausible pathway from life's origin in chemically optimal freshwater hot spring pools to the emergence of microbial communities tolerant to more extreme conditions in dilute lakes and salty conditions in marine environments. A continuity is observed for biogenesis beginning with simple protocell aggregates, through the transitional form of the progenote, to robust microbial mats that leave the fossil imprints of stromatolites so representative in the rock record. A roadmap to future testing of the hypothesis is presented. We compare the oceanic vent with land-based pool scenarios for an origin of life and explore their implications for subsequent evolution to multicellular life such as plants. We conclude by utilizing the hypothesis to posit where life might also have emerged in habitats such as Mars or Saturn's icy moon Enceladus.

First records of Charadrius semipalmatus, Bonaparte 1825 (Charadriidae) and Gelochelidon nilotica Gmelin 1789 (Sternidae) in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Around forty bird species habitually reproduce in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, and migrate to the Southern Hemisphere during northern winter. These migrating birds fly together in large or small groups until they have reached the Caribbean, Central American, or Brazilian shores. Charadrius semipalmatus, Bonaparte 1825, is one of these migrating species that uses resting and feeding areas along eastern and western coasts of North and South America, with several records for the Brazilian coast, and very few for the inland country. On November 24, 2011, an individual of this species was observed on the banks of one of the lakes that compose a complex of about 40 temporary lakes within the Karst of Lagoa Santa Environmental Protection Area. On October 29 and 30, 2012 a single individual of Gelochelidon nilotica, Gmelin 1789, was also observed in Sumidouro State Park. We suggest that these specimens have used the Atlantic Ocean migration route, following the Sao Francisco River Basin, until the karst area. Although highly impacted, the temporary lakes within the Karst of Lagoa Santa still harbor a significant number of bird species, and serve as resting and feeding places for migratory or errant species that are still eliciting new records.

Factors affecting rotifer assemblages along a nearshore to offshore transect in southeastern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rotifer assemblages have been widely used as indicators of trophic conditions. Our goal was to evaluate whether differences in rotifer assemblages along a nearshore to offshore transect in southeastern Lake Michigan were consistent with productivity differences among sites. Sampling took place in March -December during 2013-2019 at a nearshore (17-m deep), mid-depth (45-m deep), and offshore site (110-m deep). Conochilus and Keratella were present in most samples (84-100%) and were the most abun-dant taxa overall at each site, combining for around 64-69% by density of the rotifers. Although the pro-ductivity gradient was not large between sites, there was a progression with the highest contributions of Keratella, Conochilus, and Kellicottia occurring at the nearshore, mid-depth, and offshore sites, respec-tively, which is consistent with a gradient of decreasing productivity from nearshore to offshore. The roti-fer community also demonstrated strong seasonal patterns. In particular, there was a progression from dominance by illoricate forms, particularly Synchaeta, early in the season, to loricate and colonial forms in the summer and fall. Redundancy analysis indicated that in addition to productivity (i.e., total phos-phorus), predatory factors (e.g., cyclopoid copepods, Cercopagis, Bythotrephes) had a strong influence on the rotifer community and seasonal patterns. Although productivity was important in structuring rotifer assemblages along our nearshore to offshore gradient, other factors, especially those related to predation, are difficult to separate from productivity effects. This complexity somewhat limits the usefulness of roti-fers as an indicator group for productivity among sites that do not have extreme differences in trophy within a lake.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.																			0380-1330					OCT	2022	48	5					1230	1238		10.1016/j.jglr.2022.08.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2022.08.009		SEP 2022											WOS:000863068300010

As meteorological time-series extending back more than 60 years are scarce, there is a strong need for proxy data providing insight into the regional hydroclimatic history as well as the long-term variability. Within this study, a recently developed annually resolved 1500 year-long tree-ring stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) time from the southeastern TP is presented. Climat-eproxy relationships reveal a strong impact of relative humidity (rH) during the summer months (May to September) on tree-ring delta O-18, explaining around 45% of its variance. The derived reconstruction of relative humidity reveals a recent trend towards drier conditions on the TP. However, the present low rH level is not unprecedented in regard to the last 1500 years. In comparison to recent climate conditions, the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was characterized by more stable conditions with higher humidity values. Hydroclimatic conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA) suggest a contrasting two-phased period, with a clear shift from drier conditions prevailing between 1400 and 1650 AD to more humid conditions since the second half of the 17th century. Comparisons with other local proxies from lake levels and Pollen data from the southern part of the Tibetan plateau indicate a common regional climate forcing during the MWP and the LIA which can be related to changes in summer monsoon activity. However, the strength of the distinct dryness trend during the 20th century seems unique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Termination of the 2018 Florida red tide event: A tracer model perspective	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The 2018 Karenia brevis harmful algal bloom experienced along the west coast of Florida was the worst red tide occurrence there since 2005. Cell concentrations peaked in early fall of 2018, lessened in winter, and disappeared early in 2019. Here we examine the termination of this red tide event by using hindcast simulations of the West Florida Coastal Ocean Model, a numerical ocean circulation model that downscales from the deep Gulf of Mexico, across the continental shelf and into the estuaries. The underlying hypothesis is that without an offshore source of K. brevis cells, a nearshore bloom may quickly dissipate under the influence of a persistent upwelling circu-lation. To test this hypothesis, we used a passive tracer (without consideration of biological growth or decay) in the model to virtually indicate K. brevis cells. The tracer, inputted along the central West Florida coast where highest bloom concentrations were observed, was subsequently transported southward along the coast and offshore, significantly reducing the tracer concentrations over the three-month-long experimental duration, as was observed for the actual K. brevis cell concentrations. Whereas modeled tracer concentrations decreased over most of the West Florida coast, relatively higher concentrations remained just south of Sanibel Island, trapped there by the sharp bend in the coastline. Longer residence time for this area has important K. brevis implications. Lake Okeechobee nutrient flux through the Caloosahatchee River was thought to contribute to red tide in this region, and while these inputs may be a factor, a persistent upwelling circulation may also play a contributing role.					; Liu, Yonggang/B-1259-2012	Zheng, Lianyuan/0000-0002-0227-5708; Liu, Yonggang/0000-0002-0281-9349													0272-7714	1096-0015				AUG 5	2022	272								107901	10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107901		MAY 2022											WOS:000807368600001

The influence of selected environmental parameters on the distribution of the dominant demersal fishes in the Kariega Estuary channel, South Africa	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												The Kariega Estuary channel was sampled using an otter trawl and the demersal fish catch analysed using the PRIMER statistical package. A biological-environmental (BIOENV) analysis was undertaken using the catch per unit effort ichthyofaunal data from the spring/summer period of 1996/97 and concurrent water temperature, salinity and turbidity data. No strong correlations between the ichthyofauna and recorded physico-chemical parameters were documented, although temperature did show a weak correlation to demersal fish distributions. A second sampling programme undertaken in 2004 was specifically designed to test the influence of sedimentary characteristics on the distribution patterns of the dominant demersal species. Analyses showed that sediment size composition and organic content was strongly correlated (r = 0.70) to the distribution of the soles Solea bleekeri and Heteromycteris capensis, as well as the goby Glossogobius callidus. S. bleekeri and G. callidus showed a preference for the muddier middle and upper reaches of the Kariega. Estuary channel, whereas H. capensis and Psammogobius knysnaensis were more abundant in the sandier lower reaches and mouth region of the estuary. The exact reasons for these preferences are unknown but are likely to be related to preferred prey availability, foraging success and predator avoidance in the different types of sediment. Other species caught in the otter trawl were not significantly correlated to sedimentary characteristics.

In this study, 60 lakes on the QTP in summer were investigated to clarify the variation in dissolved carbon, estimate dissolved carbon storage, and reveal how environmental factors affect the variation in dissolved carbon. The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contents of 60 lakes on the QTP in summer were 12.78 mg/L and 103.66 mg/L, respectively. Salinity and total nitrogen were the important drivers of variations in DIC and DOC, respectively. Lake salinity and temperature were reduced only when precipitation was >50 mm, thus affecting the variations in lake dissolved carbon. Importantly, the elevation and area of the lake also significantly affected the variation in lake dissolved carbon. The total storage amounts of DOC and DIC in the 60 lakes on the QTP in summer were 58.94 Tg and 6.22 Tg, respectively. Lake area was the most direct factor influencing dissolved carbon storage in lakes on the QTP. Moreover, the TN and pH of the lake water also affected the DOC and DIC storage in the lakes, respectively. Interestingly, the lake pH at 9.1 was an important turning point that caused variations in lake DIC storage. Surprisingly, we found that rivers were able to transport 30 % of the DIC into QTP lakes and were the main source of DIC in the lakes in summer. The findings of this study clarify the sources of dissolved carbon and its drivers and improve our understanding of the carbon cycling processes in the lake system on the QTP.

However, the relationship between cyclic climate change and civilization remains unclear. Here we present a precisely-dated, high-resolution pollen record from the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP), which reveals similar to 500-yr and similar to 210-yr cyclic variations in vegetation and precipitation during the last similar to 3600 years. The results show that similar to 500-yr and similar to 210-yr rainfall cycles were triggered by changes in the intensity of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and the Westerlies, respectively. In addition, these two periodicities were almost in-phase with centennial-scale periodic changes in the low-latitude El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), as well as with the high-latitude North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Furthermore, the flourishing/demise of the Tubo Dynasty in China corresponds closely with the superimposed wet/dry phases of the similar to 500-yr and similar to 210-yr cyclic climate changes, suggesting a direct relationship between regional cultural evolution and multi-centennial-scale climatic cyclicity.

In the sediment, Fe (16245.84 mg/kg, Spring) was found to be maximum and Co was the minimum. In fish, the highest concentrations were found in liver (Mo, Ni, Pb, Co, Cu, Fe), while the lowest concentrations were found in gill (Mn, Zn) and muscle (Cd, Cr, Se) tissues While the highest heavy metal concentrations were observed in the sediment, the minimum was found in the fish tissues (the ranking was the following; liver, gill and muscle). It was concluded that the heavy metal levels measured in the Lake Eber have no risk to the environment and to the public health.

This study examined the spatiotemporal changes of P species and exchange potential in/between the water and sediment of the Jiaozhou Bay. The results indicated that dissolved P (TDP) and inorganic P (DIP) in the water ranged from 7.8-128.7 and 1.8-14.1 mu g/L, respectively; while total P (TP) in the sediment ranged from 213.4-638.7 mg/kg. The TDP and DIP concentrations in the water were high in winter and low in summer, and generally decreased from northeastern or northern areas to southwestern or southern areas mainly due to phytoplankton bloom cycles and riverine and wastewater inputs. TP in the sediment was lower in the northwestern area due to solid dilution effect by the settlement of settled coarser suspended particles. Changes in aquatic geochemical conditions from rivers to bay caused P accumulation in estuarine sediment, with higher P partition in organic fraction (40%). Compared to the estuarine sediment, higher fractions of P were associated with carbonate (34%) and iron oxide (17%) minerals in the bay sediment. Equilibrium P concentrations at zero sorption (EPC0) were 4.1-149.8 mu g/L, which was substantially higher than the DIP concentration, demonstrating P release potential from the sediment. In addition, the P release potential was high in the northeastern area while P partition coefficient or buffer intensity (K-d) was high in the northwestern area. EPC0 was significantly positively correlated with soluble and exchangeable P in the sediment while K-d was significantly negatively correlated. These results can provide improved insights into P behaviors in an urbanized bay, particularly the P release potential and spatiotemporal change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we studied the adaptive capabilities of the Baikal endemic amphipods Eulimnogammarus verrucosus (Gerstfeld, 1858) and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus (Dybowsky, 1874) compared to the potential Holarctic Baikal invader Gammarus lacustris Sars, 1863 at the cellular level including the energy metabolism and the antioxidant system. All species were long-term exposed to a range of temperatures (1.5 degrees C to mimic winter conditions and the three species-specific preferred temperatures (i.e., 6 degrees C for E. verrucosus, 12 degrees C for E. cyaneus and 15 degrees C for G. lacustris). At 1.5 degrees C, we found species-specific metabolic alterations (i.e., significantly reduced ATP content and lactate dehydrogenase activity) indicating limitations on the activity level in the Holarctic G. lacustris. Although the two Baikal endemic amphipod species largely differ in thermal tolerance, no such limitations were found at 1.5 degrees C. However, the cold-stenothermal Baikal endemic E. verrucosus showed changes indicating a higher involvement of anaerobic metabolism at 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C, while the metabolic responses of the more eurythermal Baikal endemic E. cyaneus may support aerobic metabolism and an active lifestyle at all exposure temperatures. Rising temperatures in summer may provide a competitive advantage for G. lacustris compared to the Baikal species but the inactive lifestyle in the cold is likely preventing G. lacustris from establishing a stable population in Lake Baikal.

DOC is a strong predictor of the attenuation of Ultraviolet Radiation (UVR) in lakes. Phytoplankton and detritus are known to contribute substantially to PAR attenuation but relatively little is known about their role in attenuation of UVR. This study investigated the relative contributions of dissolved and particulate material to the attenuation of UVR in lakes by combining an adapted Quantitative Filter Technique (QFT) with laboratory measurements of absorption by DOC and field measurements of UVR diffuse attenuation.. The absorption of filtrate and PM filtered onto glass fiber filters were scanned by a UV-visible dual beam spectrophotometer. Total absorption coefficient (a(t)) was computed as the sum of the absorption coefficients for water (a(w)), dissolved material (a(d)), and PM (a(p)). The value of a(t) was compared with the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) measured directly in the lakes by a Profiling UV radiometer (PUV-501, Biospherical Instruments, Inc.). The ratio a(t)/K-d ranged between 0.9 and 1.3 for UVR. Ratios less than unity may be attributed to scattering and to sun angle effects, especially at the longer UVR wavelengths. Ratios occasionally were measured above unity, suggesting errors in estimating a(t). Particles played a significant and seasonally-varying role in lake UVR attenuation. Within oligotrophic, low DOC Lake Giles, the relative contribution of a, to a, varied from 30% to 53% for 320 nm UVR. In mesotrophic, higher DOC Lake Lacawac the seasonal range was 7.6% to 57%. In each case, the highest contribution of PM was found during early spring and late fall.																					0-8194-2367-X				1997	2963						338	343		10.1117/12.266426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.266426													WOS:A1997BH31C00054

The oxidation rate near the sediment surface showed a distinct seasonal pattern, with maxima of up to 2.8 mmol/m(2) per day during summer. The average half-life of Mn(II) during stagnation in summer was 1.4 days. A review of published oxidation rates showed that this half-life, which cannot be explained with available data of abiotic surface catalysis, is within the typical range of microbiological oxidation. EXAFS revealed that the oxidation product consists mainly of vernadite (delta-MnO2), an X-ray-amorphous Mn(IV) oxide.

Influences on Bythotrephes longimanus life-history characteristics in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compared Bythotrephes population demographics and dynamics to predator (planktivorous fish) and prey (small-bodied crustacean zooplankton) densities at a site sampled through the growing season in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Although seasonal average densities of Bythotrephes were similar across lakes (222/m(2) Erie, 247/m(2) Huron, 162/m(2) Michigan), temporal trends in abundance differed among lakes. In central Lake Erie where Bythotrephes' prey assemblage was dominated by small individuals (60%), where planktivorous fish densities were high (14,317/ha), and where a shallow water column limited availability of a deepwater refuge, the Bythotrephes population was characterized by a small mean body size, large broods with small neonates, allocation of length increases mainly to the spine rather than to the body, and a late summer population decline. By contrast, in Lake Michigan where Bythotrephes' prey assemblage was dominated by large individuals (72%) and planktivorous fish densities were lower (5052/ha), the Bythotrephes population was characterized by a large mean body size (i.e., 37-55% higher than in Erie), small broods with large neonates, nearly all growth in body length occurring between instars 1 and 2, and population persistence into fall. Life-history characteristics in Lake Huron tended to be intermediate to those found in Lakes Michigan and Erie, reflecting lower overall prey and predator densities (1224/ha) relative to the other lakes. Because plasticity in life history can affect interactions with other species, our findings point to the need to understand life-history variation among Great lakes populations to improve our ability to model the dynamics of these ecosystems.

J	Diaz, M; Pedrozo, F; Reynolds, C; Temporetti, P				Diaz, Monica; Pedrozo, Fernando; Reynolds, Colin; Temporetti, Pedro			Chemical composition and the nitrogen-regulated trophic state of Patagonian lakes	LIMNOLOGICA					3rd Argentinean Congress on Limnology	NOV, 2005	Chascomus, ARGENTINA					Chemical composition and nutrient concentrations of 39 relatively poorly known Patagonian lakes (38-50 degrees S and from 70 degrees to 68 degrees W) are described and analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). The general relationships between nutrients (total phosphorus, bioavailable phosphorus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen) and plankton biomass are examined. We seek to demonstrate that the extreme oligotrophy characterising many lakes and reservoirs of the Argentine Patagonian region of South America owes more to nitrogen deficiency than to a shortage of available phosphorus. The data show a range of trophic conditions with variable water chemistry characteristics. The first two axes of the PCA ordination explain most of the variance (63%). The first component of the variance in the environmental data is a trophic gradient, with positive correlations with the concentrations of nutrients (TP, SRP, DIN) and electrical conductivity and a negative correlation with transparency. For all the reservoirs considered, the calculated annual, summer and winter chlorophyll-a carrying capacities of the available phosphorus were consistently and significantly (P < 0.05) in excess of observations but maximum chlorophyll-a values correlate with DIN availability. Indeed the chlorophyll-a carrying capacities, as an index of the resource-sustainable maximum biomass, of the available nitrogen gives a better predictive yield relationship than does P. Our findings are remarkable in so far as the general expectation that dinitrogen-fixing phytoplankton should thrive in the absence of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, at least to the supportive limits of the available phosphorus, is unfulfilled.

Climate Extremes in Consecutive Years Impacted the Number and Fate of Duck Nests on Great Salt Lake Marshes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The number of ground-nesting ducks in the marshes of Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah has drastically decreased in the past few decades. One potential cause for this decline is the increase in climate extremes caused by global warming. From 2019 through 2023, GSL marshes experienced 1 year of historic spring rainfall (2019), 2 years of historic droughts (2021 and 2022), and 1 year of record snowfall (2023). We used this time period to test the hypothesis that climate extremes impact both the number of duck nests and their fate (i.e., successful, depredated, or abandoned). We counted 563 nests of cinnamon teal (Spatula cyanoptera), 168 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and 220 gadwalls (Mareca strepera). Nest numbers varied among years and were positively correlated with the amount of spring rainfall (April and May). Clutch sizes differed among years and were lowest during the drought years. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were the major predators of nests. The percentage of all duck nests that were depredated varied among years and increased from 40% and 46% during the 2 wet years to 75% and 90% during the 2 drought years. The percentage of nests that were successful varied among years and were highest during the wet years. The yearly percentage of successful nests was negatively correlated with the abundance of all predators and positively correlated with snowfall because few skunks and raccoons survived the winter of 2023 with its heavy snowfall. Daily survival rates (x<overline>$$ \overline{x} $$ = 0.93), were similar among duck species, but varied among years; DSRs were lowest during the drought years (0.86 and 0.92) and highest during the wet years (0.96 for both years). Our results suggest that climate extremes will have an adverse impact on both the number of duck nests and the percentage of them that are successful.

However, its quality is increasingly threatened by a combination of natural processes and anthropogenic induced activities. Despite its importance, detailed studies on the groundwater contamination, its drivers, and the impacts remain limited due to data scarcity. This study highlights the declining groundwater quality in the region and links it to climate change-such as rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation-as well as growing anthropogenic pressures, including urbanization, industrial development, and improper disposal of municipal solid waste. Between 2015 and 2021, the groundwater levels have dropped significantly, particularly in the central urban zones like Regal Chowk and Rainawari, primarily due to over-extraction and reduced recharge. Water quality assessments reveal that 40% of samples fall into the fair to marginal category, 43% are good, and only 17% are classified as excellent. Among the sampled springs, 82% fall below the excellent category, and 12% of wells exhibit poor to marginal quality. The CCME-WQI map (Water Quality Index developed using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment methodology) indicates that the central and southern urban areas are particularly vulnerable to groundwater contamination. This heightened susceptibility is attributed to factors such as high population density, intensive industrial activity, shallow water tables, and proximity to contaminated surface water bodies like Dal Lake. Moreover, the observed decline in natural recharge and the rising rates of groundwater extraction in these areas are expected to further compromise the deeper aquifers over time, increasing their long-term vulnerability. Moverover, the presence of harmful substances such as fluoride, iron, and nitrates in the groundwater poses serious health risks, particularly in the areas that depend on unfiltered water supplies for drinking purposes. Addressing these challenges requires integrated groundwater management strategies, improved governance, and coordinated action by the stakeholders to ensure long-term water security in the region.

Abundance and stomach content analysis of threadfin shad in Lake Mead, Nevada: Do invasive quagga mussels affect this prey species?	AQUATIC INVASIONS					Conference on the Quagga Mussels in the Western United States - Monitoring and Management/World-Aquaculture-Societys-Triennial-Conference	MAR, 2010	San Diego, CA	World Aquaculture Soc Triennial, Natl Shellfisheries Assoc				Lake Mead, Nevada is the largest reservoir by volume in the United States, as well as a popular sport fishing destination. In January 2007, the invasive quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897) was discovered in the reservoir and concerns began to arise about potential alterations to the aquatic environment. The Lake Mead sport fishery is reliant on the sustainability of prey species like the threadfin shad [Dorosoma petenense (Gunther, 1867)]. This study examined 20-year trends in historic abundance of the threadfin shad, before, and shortly after, the discovery of quagga mussels in the system. Larval shad trawl data collected in Las Vegas Bay and Overton Arm portions of Lake Mead were analyzed in the present study. Two-way analysis of variances showed that the abundance of this prey fish has not changed following quagga mussel invasion (P > 0.05). Post-quagga mussel discovery collections of adult threadfin shad from Las Vegas Bay ranged from 113 to 212 mm total length (TL) (mean = 184 mm; n = 170). Shad from Overton Arm ranged from 131 to 197 mm TL (mean = 150 mm; n = 27). Stomach contents were analyzed. The proportion of in stomach contents differed significantly from spring to winter in Las Vegas Bay (P = 0.008); whereas the proportion of copepods did not show statistically relevant differences regarding seasonality (P = 0.562). Initial trends in lower trophic level dynamics in response to quagga mussel invasion has yet to reveal significant effects in Las Vegas Bay or Overton Arm. Long-term monitoring on threadfin shad is needed to evaluate potential impacts from invasive quagga mussels in Lake Mead.																			1798-6540					JUN	2011	6	2			SI		157	168		10.3391/ai.2011.6.2.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2011.6.2.05													WOS:000291958100005

However, some climate models and geological observations suggest that global climate was cool for tens of millions of years prior to the onset of Snowball Earth glaciation at similar to 717 Ma, in conflict with common interpretations of pre-glacial carbonates as warm-water carbonate factories. We report the occurrence of guttulatic microfabric-a petrographic fingerprint of ikaite, a carbonate mineral that only forms in cold sedimentary environments-in the Beck Spring Dolomite, a carbonate succession deposited in a low-latitude shallow marine environment between similar to 780 and 730 Ma. This interpretation of pre-glacial carbonate factories aligns cold conditions with vase-shaped microfossils, possible algal fossils, and molecular clock dates for crown-group metazoans. Our observations indicate that these marine ecosystems were able to thrive in cold low-latitude environments millions of years before the Snowball glaciations.					; Simpson, Carl/E-7140-2010	Simpson, Carl/0000-0003-0719-4437; Trower, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9898-5589; Mackey, Tyler/0000-0001-6377-3797; Gutoski, Jim/0000-0002-3117-7883													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 16	2023	50	5							e2022GL101903	10.1029/2022GL101903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL101903													WOS:000945380000001

In spite of the presence of increasing atmospheric warming, in summer when evaporation is maximal, in fresh-water Lake Kinneret, satellite data revealed the absence of surface water temperature (SWT) trends. The absence of SWT trends in the presence of increasing atmospheric warming is an indication of the influence of increasing evaporation on SWT trends. The increasing water cooling, due to the above-mentioned increasing evaporation, compensated for increasing heating of surface water by regional atmospheric warming, resulting in the absence of SWT trends. In contrast to fresh-water Lake Kinneret, in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located similar to 100 km apart, MODIS records showed an increasing trend of 0.8 degrees C decade(-1) in summer SWT during the same study period. The presence of increasing SWT trends in the presence of increasing atmospheric warming is an indication of the absence of steadily increasing evaporation in the Dead Sea. This is supported by a constant drop in Dead Sea water level at the rate of similar to 1 m/year from year to year during the last 25-year period (1995-2020). In summer, in contrast to satellite measurements, in-situ measurements of near-surface water temperature in Lake Kinneret showed an increasing trend of 0.7 degrees C decade(-1).					; Kishcha, Pavel/N-4696-2019	Kishcha, Pavel/0000-0002-2693-0914; Alpert, Pinhas/0000-0001-7179-6673														2072-4292				SEP	2021	13	17							3461	10.3390/rs13173461	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13173461													WOS:000694455700001

Vegetation dynamics of Kisima Ngeda freshwater spring reflect hydrological changes in northern Tanzania over the past 1200 years: Implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions at paleoanthropological sites	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Kisima Ngeda (KN), a spring on the northern margin of saline Lake Eyasi, Tanzania, sustains an Acacia-Hyphaene palm woodland and Typha swamps, while the surrounding vegetation is semi-desert. To study the vegetation changes associated with this spring, which represents a plausible modern analog for the fossil springs documented in the nearby paleoanthropological and archaeological sites of Olduvai Gorge, we analyzed the pollen content of a 43 cm-long sediment core that documents vegetation changes since the last similar to 1200 years (from cal yrs. C.E. 841 to 2011). Our results show that (1) Hyphaene palms, which require meso-halophytic soil conditions were most abundant in the area of the coring site until cal yrs. C.E. similar to 1150 when the groundwater supplying the KN spring was likely lower than at present, allowing intrusions of saline lake waters. (2) From cal yrs. C.E. similar to 1200, a peat began to develop, the palm woodland was replaced by a Mimosaceae woodland, and the increased presence of Typha pollen indicates the presence of more wetlands. (3) From cal yrs. C.E. 1600, the groundwater level of the KN spring increased and reached its highest level in the last 1200 years. (4) Peaks of wetland expansion, which reflect increased groundwater flow and level in response to amplified rainfall in the recharge area (Mt Oldeani, Ngorongoro Highlands), occurred at cal yrs. C.E. similar to 1200-1400 and similar to 1650-2011. These outflows of groundwater at Kisima Ngeda were linked to the intensity and frequency of positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events, which trigger heavy rains in eastern Africa. We conclude that the Kisima Ngeda hydrological system, which has been active for more than 1200 years, responds rapidly to regional climate change driven by changes in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the Indian Ocean. Yet, it is also capable of remaining active during dry intervals as inferred from the Kisima Ngeda record prior to cal yrs. C.E. 1200. Our results support the hypothesis that this type of system helped to maintain Plio-Pleistocene hominin populations and activities in the arid lowlands of the rift on a multi-decennial scale.					; Barboni, Doris/A-6908-2010	Bourel, Benjamin/0000-0001-8312-5471; Barboni, Doris/0000-0001-7753-1254													0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 15	2021	580								110607	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110607		SEP 2021											WOS:000701367500003

Measurements of temperature, salinity (calculated from conductivity for the ionic composition of Caspian Sea water), and dissolved oxygen were employed to investigate the processes responsible for deep-water renewal. The Caspian Sea consists of two deep basins, the southern and central basins, separated by a sill, and a shallow northern basin. The deep water (below 200 m) accounts for almost 60% of the total water mass. Below 200 m the concentrations of 3H and 3He are much lower in the southern basin than at the same depths in the central basin, but this is not the case for either of the CFCs. However, apparent water ages calculated from H-3-He-3 and from CFC-12 concentrations are the same for the deep water of the southern and central basins, and yield deep-water exchange rates of approximately 7% per year for each of the two basins. This implies volume fluxes across the 200-m level of about 2220 km(3) yr(-1) within the southern basin and 770 km(3) yr(-1) within the central basin. Based on the apparent water ages, the oxygen depletion in the deep water is estimated to be about 0.35 mg l(-1) yr(-1). The processes responsible for deep-water exchange have not yet been identified conclusively. However, vertical temperature and salinity gradients observed during two expeditions, in September 1995 and 1996, suggest that within the southern and central basins large-scale convection cannot be triggered by seasonal cooling alone, but requires the surface water to be cold/saline or to contain high suspended sediment loads. In the central basin the increase in salinity occurring during ice formation in early winter is possibly sufficient to cause convection. In late summer, the horizontal transport of water from the upper 170 m of the central basin into the southern basin results in mixing down to 400 m. In winter this process might result in convection down to the maximum depth. Alternatively, the data are also consistent with the hypothesis that rare events cause large-scale convection down to the maximum depth in the southern and in the central basin simultaneously, followed by slight mixing that mainly affects only the top 500 m. According to apparent water ages from below 500 m, the last such major mixing event could have occurred in 1976 shortly before the water level of the Caspian Sea began to rise.

Effects of nutrient enrichment on Prymnesium parvum population dynamics and toxicity: results from field experiments, Lake Possum Kingdom, USA	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Large fish kills associated with toxic populations of the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum occur worldwide. In the past 5 yr, incidences of P. parvum blooms in inland water bodies of Texas (USA) have increased dramatically, where cell densities in excess of 1 x 10(7) cells l(-1) are typically observed. We conducted field experiments (Lake Possum Kingdom) during the fall and early spring of 28 d duration using 24 enclosures of 1.57 m(3) each. The experiments investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment, immigration of F parvum and addition of barley straw extract on phytoplankton biomass and assemblage structure, P. parvum population density, zooplankton biomass and assemblage structure, bacteria, and toxicity. Nutrient enrichment stimulated P. parvum population growth beyond bloom proportions (> 1 x 10(7) cells l(-1)). However, P. parvum did not dominate the assemblage under these conditions, as it does during natural blooms. Instead, euglenophytes and chlorophytes dominated. Toxicity, estimated using fish (Pimephales promelas) and cladoceran (Daphnia magna) bioassays and which is linked to P. parvum's allelopathic and mixotrophic effectiveness, was greatly reduced (eliminated in many cases) under conditions of nutrient enrichment. The suppression of toxicity by nutrient addition suggested that targeted and time-limited nutrient manipulations might be used to mitigate the effects of R parvum blooms. Immigration of R parvum into natural assemblages and addition of barley straw extract had no significant effect on plankton dynamics.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008	Grover, James/0000-0003-2425-6927; Brooks, Bryan/0000-0002-6277-9852; Pinckney, James/0000-0002-6056-6511; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793													0948-3055	1616-1564				FEB 2	2007	46	2					125	140		10.3354/ame046125	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame046125													WOS:000244426800003

Long-Term Study of Soluble Reactive Phosphorus Concentration in Fall Creek and Comparison to Northeastern Tributaries of Cayuga Lake, NY: Implications for Watershed Monitoring and Management	WATER												This study focuses on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), a key driver of eutrophication worldwide and a potential contributor to the emerging global environmental problem of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Two studies of tributary SRP concentrations were undertaken in sub-watersheds of Cayuga Lake, NY, the subject of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) development process, due to phosphorus impairment of its southern shelf. The long-term study compared SRP concentration in Fall Creek in the 1970s with that in the first decade of the 2000s, thus spanning a period of change in phosphorus sources, as well as in regional climate. The spatial study used data collected between 2009 and 2018 and compared SRP concentrations in Fall Creek to levels in northeastern tributaries that flow into the lake close to areas where HABs have been problematic. SRP was measured using standard procedures. Flow-weighted mean SRP concentration ranged between 15.0 mu g/L and 30.0 mu g/L in all years studied in both the 1970s and 2000s, with the exception of 2010. Annual discharge in Fall Creek showed no trend between 1970 and 2018, but a higher proportion of high streamflow samples was captured in the 2000s compared to the 1970s, which resulted in proportionally increased SRP concentration in the latter time period. There was no significant difference in the SRP concentration-flow rate relationship between the two time periods. Adjusted for flow rate, SRP concentrations in Fall Creek have not changed over many decades. Increasing phosphorus contributions from growing population and urbanization since the 1970s may have been counterbalanced by improvements in wastewater treatment and agricultural practices. Mean SRP concentration in northeastern tributaries was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than in Fall Creek, likely reflecting more intense agricultural use and higher septic system density in the watersheds of the former. This finding justifies continued monitoring of minor northern tributaries. Future monitoring must emphasize the capture of high flow conditions. Historical stability and highly variable hydrology will slow the watershed response to management and confound the ability to detect changes attributable to decreased phosphorus inputs. Large scale monitoring on decadal timescales will be necessary to facilitate watershed management.

Recently, non-temperature effects of climate change (e.g., decreases in wind speed and increases in solar radiation) on large lakes have received increasing attention. To evaluate the relative contributions of both temperature and non-temperature effects on phytoplankton communities in a large eutrophic subtropical shallow lake, we analyzed long-term monitoring data from Lake Taihu, China from 1997 to 2016. Results showed that Lake Taihu's spring phytoplankton biovolume and composition changed dramatically over this time frame, with a change in dominant species. Stepwise multiple linear regression models indicated that spring phytoplankton biovolume was strongly influenced by total phosphorus (TP), light condition, wind speed and total nitrogen (TN) (r(adj)(2) = 0.8, p < 0.01). Partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) showed that light condition accounted for the greatest variation of phytoplankton community composition, followed by TP and wind speed, as well as the interactions between TP and wind speed. Our study points to the additional importance of non-temperature effects of climate change on phytoplankton community dynamics in Lake Taihu.

J	Tingley, MP; Huybers, P				Tingley, Martin P.; Huybers, Peter			Recent temperature extremes at high northern latitudes unprecedented in the past 600 years	NATURE												Recently observed extreme temperatures at high northern latitudes(1-7) are rare by definition, making the longer time span afforded by climate proxies important for assessing how the frequency of such extremes may be changing. Previous reconstructions of past temperature variability have demonstrated that recent warmth is anomalous relative to preceding centuries(2,8,9) or millennia(10), but extreme events can be more thoroughly evaluated using a spatially resolved approach that provides an ensemble of possible temperature histories(11,12). Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis(13,14) of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years. The summers of 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011 were warmer than those of all prior years back to 1400 (probability P > 0.95), in terms of the spatial average. The summer of 2010 was the warmest in the previous 600 years in western Russia (P > 0.99) and probably the warmest in western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic as well (P > 0.90). These and other recent extremes greatly exceed those expected from a stationary climate, but can be understood as resulting from constant space-time variability about an increased mean temperature.					; Tingley, Martin/K-6652-2012	Huybers, Peter/0000-0002-3734-8145; 													0028-0836	1476-4687				APR 11	2013	496	7444					201	+		10.1038/nature11969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11969								23579678					WOS:000317346300037

Summer phytoplankton occasionally shifted from N-2-fixing cyanobacteria to non-N-2-fixing forms. In 1990, additions of N fertilizer were stopped in order to test the hypothesis that low N:P loading rates cause selection for heterocystous cyanobacteria and stimulate N-2-fixation. Five years of phytoplankton nutrient-status measurements, together with estimates of N-2-fixation before and after lowering the N:P loading ratio, verified the importance of this ratio in producing blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Nitrogen input via biological N-2 fixation increased, and summer dominance by heterocystous cyanobacteria returned as a consequence of lowering the N:P ratio of external inputs. Seasonally, N return from the epilimnetic sediments increased after a period of high planktonic N-2-fixation rates. This regenerated N reduced the abundance of heterocystous cyanobacteria and lowered late summer N-2-fixation rates. Over several years, preferential regeneration of N relative to P maintained the N:P ratio of the internally cycling nutrient pool, despite the reduction in the external N:P loading ratio.																			0706-652X					OCT	1994	51	10					2247	2253		10.1139/f94-228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-228													WOS:A1994QK02600013
J	Zhang, KX; Yao, YL				Zhang, Kexin; Yao, Yulong			Lake Heatwaves and Cold-Spells Across Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Under Climate Change	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Lake heatwaves (LHWs) and cold-spells (LCSs), similar to marine heatwaves and cold-spells, can have long-term impacts on lake ecosystems and are vulnerable to climate change. Here we first comparatively assess LHW and LCS changes across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) using satellite surface water temperature observations in 160 lakes over 1978-2017. Our findings reveal notable differences in the mean and trends of LHW and LCS metrics. Specifically, total days and frequency of LHW have been increasing at a rate of 8.82 +/- 1.25 days per decade and 0.78 +/- 0.10 counts per decade, respectively. Conversely, total days and frequency of LCS have decreased at -6.52 +/- 1.46 days per decade and -0.51 +/- 0.01 counts per decade, respectively. However, average duration and mean intensity show no significant difference. Additionally, the average duration of ice cover across the QTP has been decreasing (-2.60 +/- 0.38 days per decade) due to the delayed freezing date (1.13 +/- 0.18 days per decade) and earlier thawing date (-1.28 +/- 0.27 days per decade) during 1978-2017. Furthermore, the annual mean lake surface water temperatures across the QTP exhibit a warming trend (0.00 similar to 0.47 degrees C per decade) from 1978 to 2017, with faster warming occurring in winter (0.00 similar to 0.98 degrees C per decade) compared to summer (-0.17 similar to 0.47 degrees C per decade). Accelerated lake warming will increase the frequency and mean intensity of LHWs while decreasing the number of LCSs. These results help to understand how QTP lakes respond to extreme temperatures under climate change.

However, the primary factors (e.g., climate factors, human activity, and vegetation cover) controlling aeolian deposition remain elusive. In this paper, we use a dataset that comprises new and published ages of Holocene aeolian sand and loess in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River to identify the primary controlling factors and palaeoclimatic implications of aeolian deposition. Several intervals of enhanced aeolian accumulation centered at 8.5-7.8, 6.4-5.8, 4.5-4.0, 3.1-1.8, and 0.9 ka are identified, generally consistent with regional low rainfall events and weak Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This suggests that regional wetness, dominated by the ISM, may play a key role in modulating dust emissions and aeolian deposition on centennial timescales. Our results show that on centennial- to millennial-scales, ISM activity can be reconstructed by non-continuous aeolian deposits in the monsoon dominated TP.

In most reservoirs in Israel water is filtered at the banks of the reservoirs before being sent to irrigation. This avoids/reduces clogging in the irrigation systems transferring the problem to the storage reservoirs. To cope with this problem we studied relationships between clogging and particle size distribution in a range of secondarily treated wastewater reservoirs with different characteristics and water management. Since the reservoirs are deep and thermal stratification develops, measurements of the time required to clog 100 pm pore net filters and samples for physico-chemical and microscopic analyses were collected in the surface, deep epilimnion and hypolimnion. Factor analysis allowed identifying two independent sets of environmental conditions and planktonic species that lead to clogging of irrigation filters. The first set is related to thermal stratification and the development of a planktonic community with a complex web of feeding interactions in which the organisms capable of clogging filters are mainly copepods. The second set occurs in spring and fall, and includes planktonic organisms forming a short food chain in which the organisms capable of clogging filters are mainly cladocerans. A third factor was organic loading, mostly related to the entrance of fresh wastewater into the reservoirs during the irrigation season, which had a negative effect on nitrification and promoted blue green algae development and copepod reproduction. The analysis of potential management procedures to avoid filter clogging indicates that in these reservoirs manipulations of food web interactions in the planktonic community structure towards smaller organisms that do not clog filters would not be effective against copepods. A better option to decrease clogging events is to avoid pumping water out from the deep epilimnion, preferably pumping from the hypolimnion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Variations in the light regime can affect the availability and quality of food for zooplankton grazers as well as their exposure to fish predation. In northern lakes light is particularly low in winter and, with increasing warming, the northern limit of some present-day plankton communities may move further north and the plankton will thus receive less winter light. 2. We followed the changes in the biomass and community structure of zooplankton and phytoplankton in a clear and a turbid shallow lake during winter (November-March) in enclosures both with and without fish and with four different light treatments (100%, 55%, 7% and < 1% of incoming light). 3. In both lakes total zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a were influenced by light availability and the presence of fish. Presence of fish irrespective of the light level led to low crustacean biomass, high rotifer biomass and changes in the life history of copepods. The strength of the fish effect on zooplankton biomass diminished with declining light and the effect of light was strongest in the presence of fish. 4. When fish were present, reduced light led to a shift from rotifers to calanoid copepods in the clear lake and from rotifers to cyclopoid copepods in the turbid lake. Light affected the phytoplankton biomass and, to a lesser extent, the phytoplankton community composition and size. However, the fish effect on phytoplankton was overall weak. 5. Our results from typical Danish shallow eutrophic lakes suggest that major changes in winter light conditions are needed in order to have a significant effect on the plankton community. The change in light occurring when such plankton communities move northwards in response to global warming will mostly be of modest importance for this lake type, at least for the rest of this century in an IPCC A2 scenario, while stronger effects may be observed in deep lakes.					; Richardson, Katherine/D-7592-2014; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008	Ventura, Marc/0000-0003-1401-414X; Richardson, Katherine/0000-0003-3785-2787; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2009	54	5					1093	1109		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02156.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02156.x													WOS:000265012000013
J	Hoblea, F; Gallino-Josnin, S; Audra, P				Hoblea, Fabien; Gallino-Josnin, Stephanie; Audra, Philippe			Genesis and functioning of the Aix-les-Bains hydrothermal karst (Savoie, France): past research and recent advances	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												Aix-les-Bains (Savoie, France) owes its name and reputation to the thermal springs that occur along the eastern shore of Lake Bourget, France largest natural lake. Although the city waters have been exploited since Antiquity, scientific investigations into the nature and characteristics of the hydrothermal karst from which they emerge did not begin until the early 19(th) century. The present article traces the history of these investigations and summarizes the results of more than two centuries of scientific research. Today, the only visible signs of karstification related to hydrothermal flows are to be found in the discharge zone in the Urgonian limestone anticline that rises above the city centre. These features are: - the Grotte des Serpents, which houses the Alun Spring, the system main natural discharge, - the Chevalley Aven, a blind chimney that was accidentally uncovered in 1996, - other hydrothermal springs that are too small to enter, including the Soufre Spring. Although scientific investigation of the thermal springs at Aix-les-Bains began in the early 19(th) century, it was not until the 1920s that scientists started examining the relationship between karstification and the state of the aquifer. E.A. Martel was the first researcher to describe the Aix-les-Bains site as an active hydrothermal karst, in a pioneering study published in 1935. Sixty years later, the discovery of the Chevalley Aven during building work on a new hydrotherapy center gave fresh impetus to research into the karstification of the Aix-les-Bains thermo-mineral aquifer. Recent studies have also investigated the deep aquifer below the karst, using data provided by boreholes. The Urgonian limestone karst at Aix-les-Bains is the site of mixing between thermal waters rising through the anticline and meteoric waters percolating from the surface. Meteoric infiltration is sufficiently high for the hydrological behavior of the thermal springs to be identical to that of exsurgences in gravity-fed, cold-water transmissive karsts. The Chevalley Aven is a shaft that descends 30 meters below the surface, thereby providing access to the ground-water at depth. Monitoring of the water quality in the aven has shown that the Legionella contamination of the springs was due to high concentrations of the bacteria in upstream passages in the karst. In 2006, dye-tracing tests confirmed the existence of a hydraulic connection between the Chevalley Aven and the Alun and Soufre Springs, the fact there is a single ascending hydrothermal conduit, which lies between the Chevalley Aven and the Alun Spring. In addition to providing a valuable source of information about the functioning of the thermo-mineral aquifer, the cavities at Aix-les-Bains are of great karstological interest, especially for the study of hypogene speleogenetic processes. The circulation of warm (40 degrees C), sulfur-rich waters and vapors through the system has led to the development of conduits with specific morphologies and the precipitation of characteristic deposits. These features include: - "beaded" chimneys and galleries formed by the linking of spheres produced by condensation-corrosion. Diffuse karstification along bedding planes around the main conduit; - deposition of non-carbonate minerals (gypsum, native sulfur); - formation of biothems and biofilms on walls subject to condensation. The Grotte des Serpents is a horizontal cavity that formed at the upper limit of the water table. The Chevalley Aven is a hypogene chimney that was sculpted under vadose conditions by the release of sulfuric acid-rich vapors above the thermal water table. As well as a surface coating of microbial mats and the presence of bacterial flakes in the thermal water, the vadose parts of the Aix-les-Bains hydrothermal karst contain a characteristic microfauna and flora. These microorganisms are thought to play an active role in hypogene karstification processes.					; audra, philippe/HGD-1087-2022	Hoblea, Fabien/0000-0003-3857-6155; Audra, Philippe/0000-0001-9152-9935; 													0037-9409	1777-5817					2010	181	4					315	326		10.2113/gssgfbull.181.4.315	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gssgfbull.181.4.315													WOS:000281688400003

A mid-Holocene climate reconstruction for eastern South America	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The mid-Holocene (6000 calibrated years before present) is a key period in palaeoclimatology because incoming summer insolation was lower than during the late Holocene in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas the opposite happened in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the effects of the decreased austral summer insolation over South American climate have been poorly discussed by palaeodata syntheses. In addition, only a few of the regional studies have characterised the mid-Holocene climate in South America through a multiproxy approach. Here, we present a multiproxy compilation of mid-Holocene palaeoclimate data for eastern South America. We compiled 120 palaeoclimatological datasets, which were published in 84 different papers. The palaeodata analysed here suggest a water deficit scenario in the majority of eastern South America during the mid-Holocene if compared to the late Holocene, with the exception of northeastern Brazil. Low mid-Holocene austral summer insolation caused a reduced land-sea temperature contrast and hence a weakened South American monsoon system circulation. This scenario is represented by a decrease in precipitation over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone area, saltier conditions along the South American continental margin, and lower lake levels.

Life cycle of a small endemic goby Economidichthys pygmaeus (Family: Gobiidae) in Lake Pamvotis, northwestern Greece	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The life history tactics of the small endemic freshwater goby Economidichhtys pygmaeus were examined in a Mediterranean shallow lake located in the northwestern part of Greece (Lake Pamvotis). The purpose of the study was to define the population structure, growth, length at sexual maturity, sex ratio, annual cycle of gonad development, spawning characteristics and fecundity. Fish samples were collected using a hand net from October 2006 to September 2007. The fish grew rapidly in summer after hatching, matured after their first winter, and bred from February to June. The length frequency distribution indicated the appearance of two cohorts per year. Juveniles occurred in samples from April to September. Maturity length (ML50) of males and females were estimated to be 23.54 and 23.28 mm TL, respectively. Sexual dimorphism related to the male caudal fin was observed and males grew to greater lengths than females. The overall ratio of males to females was 1:1.35. Spawning was from February to June. Ripe females appeared to be multiple spawners, with oocytes at different stages of development. Size of oocytes changed during maturation and increased in diameter from about 0.125 to more than 0.9 mm. Absolute fecundity was positively related to TL and TW and varied between 59 and 309 eggs. After reproduction, the number of parental individuals decreased.

J	Reid, DD; Montgomery, SS				Reid, DD; Montgomery, SS			Creel survey based estimation of recreational harvest of penaeid prawns in four southeastern Australian estuaries and comparison with commercial catches	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Stratified, roving creel surveys done at night, provided estimates of the quantity caught, and information about species, sex and size composition of the catches of penaeids by recreational fishers in four New South Wales (NSW) estuaries during the spring-summer seasons of 1991-1992, 1992-1993 and 1993-1994. Overall, recreational catches were estimated to be 30% (+/- 12%) of the total commercial catch of all prawn species from these estuaries over the 3 years of the study, but there was great variability between estuaries. Recreational catches represented 57% ( +/- 5%) of the commercial catch for Lake Illawarra, 36% ( +/- 4%) for Tuggerah Lakes, 17% ( +/- 3%) for Wallis Lake and 10% ( +/- 2%) for Coila Lake. The species composition of the recreational catch differed from the commercial catch, with the recreational fishery taking a larger proportion of eastern king prawns Penaeus plebejus than school prawns Metapeneaus macleayi and few greasyback prawns Metapenaeus bennettae. The size distributions of eastern king prawns were similar between recreational and commercial catches in three of the four estuaries. Mean catch rates (kg/h) of recreational prawners varied between estuaries and between harvest methods. Recreational prawning on the ebb-tide in the dark of the moon was strongly favoured by prawners, particularly in the areas of the estuaries affected by tides. Our results showed that the recreational fishery is a significant harvester of the prawn resources of NSW. The impact of the recreational fishery, therefore, needs to be incorporated into stock assessments of the prawn resources and it needs to be considered during any determinations about the optimal biological conditions for harvesting these resources. This study demonstrated that it is possible to do surveys at night using intercept techniques on fisheries where artificial lighting is used. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Significant research efforts have been directed to the origin of K-Li resources and evolutionary history of the QSL. However, the study on the different sources, recharge processes, and differential distribution patterns for these resource elements in brine deposits is still inadequate. Therefore, we measured Li-B concentrations and H-O-Sr-B isotopic compositions of different waters (river, spring, and brine) from the QSL, combined with the reported K-Sr contents and multiple isotopes of waters, to discuss the recharge, source of K-Sr-Li-B and their spatial distributions, by analogy with other evaporite basins in the world. The results show that: (1) the K-Li-B-Sr elemental concentrations of brines and their spatial distribution in the QSL are diverse; (2) high K and Sr values are distributed in Dabuxun and Qarhan sections, respectively, which are controlled by Ca-Cl springs in the northern QSL; on the contrary, Li and B values are enriched in the Bieletan section and are charged by thermal springs in the Kunlun Mountains; (3) the formation and evolution of Ca-Cl and thermal springs constrain fundamentally on the recharge processes of K-Sr and Li-B elements in the terminal salt lakes of the Qaidam Basin (QB); (4) some analogues of recharge processes limit the resource elements of the QSL and other salt lakes (Da Qaidam, Lop Nur, Zhabuye, Atacama, and Guayatayoc) in the world provides a reference for the resource exploration in deep formation waters in the evaporite basins.																			2096-5508	2523-3521				JUL	2023	41	4			SI		1226	1242		10.1007/s00343-023-2258-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-023-2258-7		AUG 2023											WOS:001042492600001

Following grow-out, advanced-size individuals were stocked into respective reservoirs. We measured the contribution of stocked individuals to corresponding year classes in receiving reservoirs. Largemouth bass survival in nursery ponds at the end of the grow-out period was 15.6% at Lake Conroe and 20.9% at Lake Gladewater. A total of 2.8 fish/ha (mean total length = 138 mm) were stocked in Lake Conroe and 8.8 fish/ha (mean total length = 121 mm) were stocked in Lake Gladewater. Following reservoir stockings, largemouth bass populations were sampled with electrofishing gear in fall and spring and electrophoretic analysis was conducted to evaluate the contribution of stocked fish to corresponding year classes. Largemouth bass from nursery ponds comprised 0.0%, 5.0%, and 0.0% of the 1991 cohort at Lake Conroe in October 1991, April 1992, and November 1992 electrofishing samples, respectively. Largemouth bass from Lake Gladewater nursery ponds comprised 4.5%, 6.7% and 0.0% of the 1992 cohort in December 1992, March 1993, and March 1993 electrofishing samples, respectively.

Part of the Fennoscandian and the entire Western Main subpopulations of LWfG and the global population of RbGs are believed to stage there, which facilitates obtaining up-to-date population estimates for these species. A total of 80 lakes were surveyed across four survey areas in autumn 2016, recording more than 1.2 million geese in the region. Greater White-fronted Geese Anser alblfrons (GWfG) were the most abundant with an estimated c. 890,000 birds, with counts of c. 250,000 Greylag Geese Anser anser, c. 53,000 Ruddy Shelduck ladorna ferruginea, c. 39,100 RbG and c. 32,000 LWfG also recorded during the surveys. Based on aprinti lake classification for both LWfG and RbG, to stratify survey lakes in order to generate total population estimates, survey teams visited a sample of different lake types. After removing lakes smaller than the observed minimum lake size used by each species, the total number of potential lakes available within the core staging areas of each species (335 lakes of > 320 ha for LWfG; 361 lakes of > 100 ha for RbG) was calculated. Bootstrapping procedures, with replacement, were then used to estimate the total numbers likely to be present in the region. These calculations produced total estimates of 34,250 birds (95% confidence intervals = 28,500-40,100 birds) for the Western Main population of LWfG (well in excess of current population estimates of 8,000-13,000 individuals) and an estimated population of 50,100 RbG (95% CI = 28,100-72,600 birds), broadly similar to recent population estimates of 55,000-57,000. We recommend that future surveys continue to monitor as large a region and as many lakes as possible in order to capture inter-annual variation in the distribution of birds and to provide more reliable assessments of population size and trends of these migratory species.

There are four hot springs around the Tianchi Lake with temperatures of 7 similar to 47 degrees C. By deduction of the lakebed topography, the present caldera was formed in millennium eruption, and then a small vent in western Tianchi Lake and a lava dome in eastern emerged. There are 5 larger collapsed deposition areas of inner caldera wall, but no lava flow on the Tianchi lakebed. The spots of hot springs around the Tianchi Lake match with its ring fractures, which reflects a deep magmatic body.					wu, chengzhi/LMP-4866-2024														1000-0569	2095-8927					2018	34	1					185	193																WOS:000424882800016

Variations of the thermal-ice regime and outflow temperature under typical hydro-metrological conditions were simulated and validated with field data. Due to the partial dismantling of the old dam after the reconstruction, the intake water is primarily taken from the surface layer of the reservoir. As a result, the total heat storage of the reservoir throughout the year and the outflow temperature from January to March will decrease. Furthermore, the low outflow temperature in the winter will result in a decline of the downstream water temperature and negatively impact the rime scenery near Jilin City. In order to increase the outflow temperature in winter, an operation scheme that combined the new intake with the old intake of the III-phase project of old dam was discussed. The results indicated that this scheme could increase the outflow temperature to ensure a 70 km open channel in the downstream river in a typical winter, and eliminated the negative effects on the rime scenery.

NEW SPECIES AND RECORDS OF CHIHUAHUAN DESERT SPRINGSNAILS, WITH A NEW COMBINATION FOR TRYONIA BRUNEI	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												This is the last in a series of papers clarifying the taxonomy of a critically imperiled assemblage of Cochliopid gastropods (Tryonia sensu lato) that inhibit thermal springs in the Chihuahuan Desert (Mexico and United States). We describe 2 new narrowly endemic species of Tryonia from Chihuahua, both of which appear to have been recently,extirpated, and we provide new records for 4 congeners (also from Chihuahua) and for a species of Pseudotryonia (from Durango). The 2 new species of Tryonia differ from closely similar regional congeners in shell and penial characters. On the basis of new anatomical data, we also transfer T brunet Taylor, 1987 to the genus Juttamia and provide evidence that this species, which was endemic to the Phantom Lake spring complex in west Texas, became extinct sometime after 1984. Our findings provide additional insight into the complex biogeographic history of the Chihuahuan Desert cochliopids and further document the recent decline of regional spring-dwelling biota as a result of groundwater mining.

Here we investigate two taxa adapted to different lifestyles. Baetis macani Kimmins (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) lives in flowing water; brooks that may periodically dry out in the summer or freeze to the bottom in winter. Baetis jaervii Savolainen is mostly found in sedge belts along the shores of lakes. Most insects living in flowing water show low levels of among-population genetic differentiation within and among catchments. Levels of differentiation in the lotic species are therefore assumed to be lower than in lentic B. jaervii. Here we test this hypothesis. Mitochondrial DNA and allele frequencies of nuclear genes were used to detect population structure in specimens originating from an extensive area from northern Finland. The genetic differentiation among populations of the lotic B. macani is more than twice the corresponding value for the lentic B. jaervii (F-ST 0.33 versus 0.15, while the mean F-ST between species was 0.33 and significant). The result is congruent within the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) partial gene frequencies. We argue that the significant genetic population structure, which only was found in the lotic B. macani, is differentiated as a consequence to the unpredictable environment as contrasted to the stable environment in standing bodies of water.

Thinking outside of the lake: Can controls on nutrient inputs into Lake Erie benefit stream conservation in its watershed?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Investment in agricultural conservation practices (CPs) to address Lake Erie's re-eutrophication may offer benefits that extend beyond the lake, such as improved habitat conditions for fish communities throughout the watershed. If such conditions are not explicitly considered in Lake Erie nutrient management strategies, however, this opportunity might be missed. Herein, we quantify the potential for common CPs that will be used to meet nutrient management goals for Lake Erie to simultaneously improve stream biological conditions throughout the western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) watershed. To do so, we linked a high-resolution watershed hydrology model to predictive biological models in a conservation scenario framework. Our modeling simulations showed that the implementation of CPs on farm acres in critical and moderate need of treatment, representing nearly half of the watershed, would be needed to reduce spring/early summer total phosphorus loads from the WLEB watershed to acceptable levels. This widespread CP implementation also would improve potential stream biological conditions in >11,000 km of streams and reduce the percentage of streams where water quality is limiting biological conditions, from 31% to 20%. Despite these improvements, we found that even with additional treatment of acres in low need of CPs, degraded water quality conditions would limit biological conditions in >3200 stream km. Thus, while we expect CPs to play an important role in mitigating eutrophication problems in the Lake Erie ecosystem, additional strategies and emerging technologies appear necessary to fully reduce water quality limitation throughout the watershed.

In total eight objects were examined: 1) two small solfataric fields, 2) a small lake and a small stream with << acid springs >> and gas outlets, 3) two small glades with mofettes among the bamboo, on which a warm or fairly hot steam flows from small holes in the ground, 4) and two mountain lakes Lake Vodopadnoe and Lake Khmuroe.

Migrations by fluvial largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) after transport upstream of Milltown Dam, Montana	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Despite the abundance of largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) in western North America, little is known about their biology and ecology. Tens of thousands of largescale suckers annually congregate in the spring in the tailrace of Milltown Dam, Montana, apparently impeded on upstream migrations. To determine the destination of migrants and attributes of their migrations we implanted 14 fluvial largescale suckers with radio transmitters and tracked movements after transport upstream of Milltown Dam. Fish were apparently homing to natal areas and selected one of two drainages in which to spawn. Movements to upriver-most locations varied widely, fish used diverse areas in the watershed, and moved very far to spawn (mean 55 km, range 5.1-159.2 km). After the spawning period, fish moved either up or downstream, others stayed in the same location into the fall. Only two fish moved downstream of Milltown Dam after the spawning period and potentially back to a pre-spawning location. These movements demonstrate the effects of the dam on largescale sucker populations over a large spatial scale, and suggest that providing fish passage at Milltown Dam would result in a tremendous amount of biomass transferred to upriver areas. Fish passage considerations at Milltown Dam focus only on bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi). Providing upstream passage of largescale suckers at this dam may help promote full ecosystem recovery.

Both lakes formed in 2011, when an anomalously high melt season was followed by low winter accumulation, resulting in reduced infiltration and storage in the near surface. The lakes expanded during the 2012 record melt season and retained liquid meltwater through the following winter. The lakes then contracted, with one lake slowly draining and refreezing and another rapidly draining to the subsurface. The lack of observable change in firn conditions surrounding the lakes indicates increased run-off in the near surface firn, likely along low-permeability ice layers formed during the previous melt seasons. This implies a reduced ability of the firn to absorb increased meltwater.

However, research on waterbird communities in high-water-level gate-controlled lake basins remains limited. The Chaohu Lake basin in China, a typical high-water-level gate-controlled lake wetland system, harbors a unique wetland complex with distinct hydrological attributes. This system provides an ideal model system for exploring ecological mechanisms maintaining waterbird community diversity under drought disturbance. This study first assessed overall differences between wetland types, then further used a refined functional group classification method to compare differences between drought (2022-2023) and baseline (2021-2022) years in wintering waterbird metacommunity composition at regional (basin) and local (lake, river, and pond) scales, and investigated key environmental drivers. Results show that extreme drought reshaped the community structure of wintering waterbirds within the basin, with positive ecological feedback observed at regional and local scales, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Bird body mass, beak length, tarsus length, and food types were the key functional traits distinguishing five functional groups. Although responses varied among functional groups, water depth was a key driver of community change across habitats. In summary, this study reveals that high-water-level gate-controlled lake plays an essential role in maintaining wintering waterbird diversity under drought disturbance, emphasizes the importance of functional group classification in analyzing community responses, and informs developing diversified adaptive strategies for complex wetland systems.

J	Swadling, KM; McKinnon, AD; De'ath, G; Gibson, JAE				Swadling, KM; McKinnon, AD; De'ath, G; Gibson, JAE			Life cycle plasticity and differential growth and development in marine and lacustrine populations of an Antarctic copepod	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined life cycle plasticity in two populations of the copepod Paralabidocera antarctica, one of which inhabits the coastal sea ice belt of Antarctica and the other of which has been isolated in a nearby saline lake for several thousand generations. Similarities in the life cycles of the two populations included long overwintering phases (>5 months) by late-stage nauplii, rapid development through the copepodid stages, and a short adult life span of 2-3 weeks. Adults appeared in late spring or early summer and spawned and died soon after. However, the life cycle of the lacustrine population was much less tightly regulated than at the marine site; animals were rarely found living within the lake ice, and synchrony in the developmental cycle was diminished. It is likely that a combination of factors, including ice hardness, a lack of predation threat, and a consistent food supply has freed the lacustrine population from the constraints imposed by living within the ice cover. Instantaneous growth rates calculated for the marine site showed a variable growth rate (0.04-0.14 d(-1)). The lacustrine population in general had faster growth rates than the marine population (0.10-0.26 d(-1)) and reached maturity at a smaller size. This is attributed, in part, to the higher environmental temperatures experienced by the lacustrine population.

We sampled potential primary producers (littoral, pelagic sources and detritus), fish and macroinvertebrates from littoral and pelagic zones of the lake during spring and summer in 2013. The relative importance of basal sources assimilated by invasive (Carassiusspp.) and native fishes (Squalius cephalus, Capoeta banarescui,Cyprinu scarpio) was estimated using SIAR mixing model. Consumers such as collector-gatherer (1) (-35.33 parts per thousand) and S. cephalus, Carassiusspp., and C. carpio had more C-13 depleted (-32.12, -31.09, -31.54 parts per thousand, respectively), while C. banarescui, collector-gatherer (2), and etc. had more C-13 enriched values (-25.03, - 26.55 parts per thousand, respectively). SIAR and gut contents indicate that main energy sources were highly variable among fishes, three main sources contributed to invasive fish, but littoral sources for C. banarescui, pelagic sources for S. cephalus, and detritus and pelagic sources for C. carpiowere important. Consumer's biomass were also partially linked to detritus. Our study suggested that all species promoted coupling of pelagic and littoral pathways, and competition for resources among invasive and native fishes was likely to cause resources sharing, and to shift to suboptimal resources.

This research determines processes controlling the magnitude of energy fluxes between a small Canadian Shield lake and the atmosphere. Meteorological instruments were deployed on a floating platform in the middle of a 5-ha lake during the 1999 and 2000 open-water seasons. High attenuation of incoming radiation at shallow depths and the sheltered location of the lake allows a strong thermocline to develop during the summer months, which prevents deeper water from exchanging energy with the atmosphere. Only after the lake becomes isothermal in late August do deeper waters interact with the atmosphere. When the lake is warming, evaporation is controlled by net radiation, but when the lake is cooling, turbulent energy fluxes are mainly influenced by the vapor pressure deficit. An empirically derived logarithmic relationship was identified between the Bowen ratio and the vapor pressure deficit. The Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Enhanced Study ( CAGES) water year was characterized by a cool dry July that prevented the lake from warming to expected normal conditions. With less of the available energy directed to heating the lake, more was available for the turbulent fluxes, but evaporation rates did not increase. Because of the inability of radiation to penetrate to deep water in this lake, it is unlikely that even local extremes in air temperature and incoming solar radiation create the summer isothermal conditions observed in more southern Canadian Shield lakes, which allow more energy to be directed toward evaporation during the summer months.																			1525-755X					AUG	2003	4	4					694	701		10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004<0694:EBPOAS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004<0694:EBPOAS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184560000006

The river deltas and estuaries are interesting for studying the flux of plastics into the oceans. The Nile River has been identified as a hot spot of plastic litter flux in the eastern Mediterranean basin. In addition, it was nicknamed "Plastic Nile", yet this major river is largely unexplored with a lack of field measurements and adequate surveys. The current study was based on bridging this scientific gap. Three trips were conducted, cover-ing 30 km in the Rosetta branch and 23 km in the Damietta branch, during the high water level in summer 2021, and 10 km off the inlet of Lake Burullus, in spring 2021. Microplastics in surface water ranged from 761 +/- 319 to 1718 +/- 1008 MPs/m3, and from 167 +/- 137 to 1630 +/- 1303 MPs/kg of dry sediments. Land use/ land cover mapping using Sentinel-2 images showed several sources of pollution that contribute to plastic contamination in the study area. Ther-mal analysis indicated seven plastic polymers; including, PE, PP, PET, PEVA, and PTFE, using discarded plastic prod-ucts as reference materials. Microplastics were composed of colored and glossy fragments of sizes <500 mu m, originating from land-based sources. Pollution load, polymer risk assessment, and ecological risk indices were calculated. Based on field observations macro-plastics were retained within the extensive network of infrastructure and dam systems. 80-106 billion MPs/year were estimated to flux from the Nile estuaries into the Mediterranean Sea. The current situation urges the development of binding plans to reduce plastic waste in the Nile Delta, as well as setting environ-mental monitoring points along the Deltaic coast.					; Ghobashy, Mohamed/O-3518-2016; El-Alfy, Muhammad/AAH-6274-2020; ghobashy, mohamed/O-3518-2016; Darwish, Dina/AAV-9669-2021; Elsayed/ADR-1673-2022; Ibrahim, Mohammed/IUQ-7100-2023; Shabaka, Soha/AAP-3814-2021	Youssef, Nabiha/0000-0003-1261-0327; Hamouda, Amr/0000-0001-8176-2530; Ghobashy, Mohamed/0000-0003-0968-1423; Ibrahim, Mohamed/0000-0001-6190-5899; Darwish, Dina H./0000-0002-4266-0926; El-Sayed, Abeer/0000-0002-8720-086X; El-Alfy, Muhammad/0000-0003-3061-4233; Shabaka, Soha/0000-0002-4142-8543													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 15	2022	852								158446	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158446		SEP 2022						36058336					WOS:000874749500003

Intracellular, environmental and biotic interactions influence recruitment of benthic Microcystis (Cyanophyceae) in a shallow eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Microcystis is known to overwinter on sediment surfaces and provide an inoculum to support water column blooms in lakes. There is uncertainty as to whether recruitment is an active process triggered by internal changes in buoyancy, or a passive process induced by resuspension. The effect on Microcystis recruitment of ammonium, light and temperature was assessed in laboratory experiments using sediments collected in a small eutrophic lake from two habitats: near-edge (containing Microcystis and Aphanizomenon gracile) and mid-lake (predominantly Microcystis). In all experiments single cells, rather than colonies, accounted for the majority (>55%) of recruited cells. Microcystis recruitment was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in near-shore samples suggesting that A. gracile elicits allelopathic effects on Microcystis. In mid-lake samples, Microcystis recruitment was significantly higher at moderate ammonium concentrations (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L-1; P < 0.001), at two temperatures (16 and 25 degrees C; P < 0.001) and high light intensities (50 and 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); P < 0.01). Microcystis cells were isolated from sediment in spring, early and late summer and assessed using transmission electron microscopy. The percentage of cell area filled with gas vesicles increased significantly (P < 0.001). These data demonstrate that allopathic interactions, ammonium, light and temperature can individually and synergistically regulate gas vesicle synthesis and Microcystis recruitment.

Black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) wintering at Dianchi Lake (Yunnan Province, southwestern China) prefer to forage on easily accessible human-provided food at various sites along the lake. Following the closure of the lake because of the pandemic, synthetic food was provided at a single location. We expected that the home range size and distribution of gulls would change in response to these changes in food provisioning. A total of 91 gulls were tagged with satellite transmitters in November 2018 and March 2019, and their movements were tracked during the winter months. We analyzed their home range size and spatial distribution in four periods, SCP2019, SOP2019, SCP2020, and SOP2020 (Scenic Opening/Closing Period in 2019/2020), and the difference between SOP2019 and SCP2019 was used as the control group. The eutrophication level in the wintering periods "Nov. 2018-Apr. 2019" and "Oct. 2019-Apr. 2020" was determined using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the coverage ratio of algal blooms and NDVI were used as indicators of the amount of naturally available food. The home range sizes of gulls were reduced in SCP2020 compared with SOP2019, SCP2019, and SOP2020. The gulls were most abundant in the 600-900 m buffer zone and least abundant in the 0-300 m buffer zone in SCP2019; they were most abundant in the 0-300 m buffer zone and least abundant in the 900-2000 m buffer zone in SCP2020. These patterns were consistent with variation in the NDVI and the coverage ratio of algal blooms among buffer zones. Changes in wintering behaviors in SCP2020 relative to other periods suggested that gulls modified their behavior following anthropause-related changes in the distribution and provisioning of food. Our findings provide insights into the role of behavioral plasticity in mediating adaptation to changes in human activities in birds.

In addition, all these characteristics are clearly applicable to the reconstruction of the history of anthropogenic impacts on polluted environments. Cyprideis torosa, which was found to be dominant species in our study, is recognized for its opportunistic and competitive nature, enabling it to colonize polluted areas with high levels of metallic trace elements. The unpolluted site (S3) at the mouth of the Sejnane river which flows into Ichkeul Lake revealed the presence of glassy species with normal morphological valves, while the polluted sites contained ostracods marked by white-beige or orange color. The Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) microanalysis of ostracod shells using a transmission electron microscope revealed iron and copper concentrations at almost all studied sites. Iron is responsible for the red-orange (rust) color of the studied shells which exhibited morphological abnormalities. Indeed, the color observed in the studied ostracods could be attributed to the presence of iron. Microanalysis performed on the investigated ostracods' shells reveals the effects of Jebel Ichkeul structure. Thus, the Jurassic and Triassic metamorphic series, coupled with lode mineralization and iron-rich hydrothermal activity, have influenced the shape and the color of these shells. Furthermore, the ostracod test contains numerous elements that do not typically fit into the carbonate mineral network. The absence of ostracofauna from the river that drains directly from the Jalta mine site (S13) confirms the anthropogenic perturbation and the metal pollution affecting the natural composition of the waters ecosystems. Nevertheless, more sophisticated studies are necessary to quantify the metals stored in organisms' molts and to investigate their bio-availability. This study also highlights the results of the summer period, compared to those of the winter period already published (Ouchir et al., in Arab J Geosci 9(9):1-12, 2016), revealing an accumulation of metallic elements attributed to the combined effects of water and wind transport agents, which can mobilize the highly mineralized fine fractions, particularly during the summer.																			2365-6433	2365-7448				FEB	2025	10	1			SI		515	541		10.1007/s41207-024-00612-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41207-024-00612-1		AUG 2024											WOS:001296490600002
C	Hodgetts, L		Monks, GG		Hodgetts, L			Dorset Palaeoeskimo harp seal exploitation at Phillip's Garden (EeBi-1), north-western Newfoundland	Exploitation and Cultural Importance of Sea Mammals					9th Conference of the International-Council-of-Archaeozoology (ICAZ)	AUG 23-28, 2002	Durham, ENGLAND					Radiocarbon dates from the Dorset Palaeoeskimo harp seal hunting site of Phillip's Garden on the northwest coast of Newfoundland, Canada, suggest that the site was most intensively occupied during the middle centuries of its occupation. An analysis of dwelling structure and artifact assemblages at the site suggests that activities were more generalized during the site's early and later years, with very specialized hunting occupations during the middle period (Erwin 1995). In this paper, faunal data are used to test this model of site development. Relative importance of seal versus other classes of faunal material show extremely focussed harp seal hunting in both the early and middle phases of the site's history, with an increase in non-seal taxa in later years. Metrical data suggest that hunting took place during both winter and spring harp seal migrations throughout the occupation of Phillip's Garden. Age structure, as indicated by long bone measurements and epiphyseal fusion, indicates strong selection for mature individuals during the middle phase. In contrast, young seals are well represented in both the early and late phases, suggesting that hunting patterns were less specialized at times when the site was less intensively occupied. Overall, these data appear to support Erwin's model, suggesting that harp seal hunting was most selective during the middle phase of occupation at the site.																					1-84217-126-7				2005							62	76																WOS:000232913000005

Because Mysis, a cold stenotherm, was restricted to the metalimnion of lakes during summer, the pH range encountered by the population was 5.51-6.32 in 1978 and 5.23-6.10 in 1979, even though mean pH values in epilimnion waters for the 2 yr were 5.84 and 5.60. A decrease in pH of its habitat from 6.2 to 5.6 during fall overturn in 1979 caused the elimination of the remaining 4% of the population. Comparisons with 4 control lakes suggested that the decline and disappearance were not normal occurrences in unstressed lakes. Concentrations of Zn, Al, Mn, Fe, Cd, Cu, Ni and Hg in Lake 223 water were low, and concentrations in Mysis were less than or equal to those in animals from 5 control lakes, suggesting that the decline in this species was not due to the toxic effects of metals. All size classes were affected, so that direct toxicity of H+ may have been responsible for this abrupt population collapse. Mysis may have been a useful early indicator of acidification damage to Precambrian Shield lakes.

J	Liu, QW				Liu, Qiwei			RESEARCH ON WATER DEMAND PLANNING OF URBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Taking a planning garden in Jinan City as the research object, the urban landscape ecological environment is divided into two parts: the urban river and lake system and the urban green space system. Aiming at the urban river and lake system, the river and lake water surface evaporation calculated by the water balance formula is 9.5-94.9 m(3)/m(2).month, and the permeation volume of the river and lake calculated by Darcy's law is around 0.034-0.053 m(3)/m(2).month. The basic ecological water demand of the river calculated from the minimum monthly average flow method is from 18 to 39.5 m(3)/m(2).month, and the total water demand of the river and lake system is estimated around 30.875-76.47 m(3)/m(2).month. Jinan area needs artificial water replenishment in summer (June-August) from 18,000 to 25,000 m(3)/m(2).month. In winter (November to February next year), the river is in a freezing period, and no water supply is required. For the green space system, the green rate is 32%. According to the urban green rate rules, the standard green rate (100%-120%) cannot be reached. It is concluded that the green area in the planned park should be increased by 19.22km(2).

Here we apply a climate change "test" to a framework for estimating the amount of agricultural conservation practices needed to achieve desired fish conservation outcomes for four watersheds in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan, USA. We developed three climate scenarios from global climate model outputs (high emissions scenario, "2080s" timeframe) to provide insight on potential impacts of a climate driver that represents a key uncertainty for this management system, the amount and timing of spring and summer precipitation. These scenarios were used as inputs to agricultural watershed models, which produced water quality outputs that we compared to thresholds in fish biodiversity metrics at the subwatershed scale. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on evaporation rates and other aspects of hydrology will shift the relative importance of key stressors for fish (i.e., sediment loadings vs. nutrient concentrations) across these different watersheds, highlighting the need to design resilient implementation plans and policies. Overall, we found that changes in climate are likely to increase the need for agricultural conservation practices, but that increasing the implementation rate above current levels will likely remain a good investment under current and future climate conditions.

The work analyzes vertical profiles of air vapor pressure, and equilibrium vapor pressure over liquid water and ice. Based only on the magnitude ranking of these vapor pressures, we identified conditions where liquid droplets and ice particles grow or deplete simultaneously, as well as the conditions where droplets evaporate and ice particles grow by vapor diffusion. The method is applied to ground-based remote-sensing observations during two snowstorms, using two distinct microwave profiling radiometers operating in different climatic regions (North American Central High Plains and Great Lakes). The results are compared with independent microwave radiometer retrievals of vertically integrated liquid water, cloud-base estimates from a co-located ceilometer, reflectivity factor and Doppler velocity observations by nearby vertically pointing radars, and radiometer estimates of liquid water layers aloft. This work thus makes a positive contribution toward monitoring and nowcasting the evolution of supercooled droplets in winter clouds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Metagenomic Insights into the Evolution, Function, and Complexity of the Planktonic Microbial Community of Lake Lanier, a Temperate Freshwater Ecosystem	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Lake Lanier is an important freshwater lake for the southeast United States, as it represents the main source of drinking water for the Atlanta metropolitan area and is popular for recreational activities. Temperate freshwater lakes such as Lake Lanier are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other ecosystems. To better characterize the gene content and variability of this freshwater planktonic microbial community, we sequenced several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach. Comparative metagenomics revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to soil. However, the phylogenetic diversity of Lake Lanier communities was distinct from that of soil and marine communities. We identified several important genomic adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of potassium (as opposed to sodium) osmoregulators by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average genome size. We show that the lake community is predominantly composed of sequence-discrete populations and describe a simple method to assess community complexity based on population richness and evenness and to determine the sequencing effort required to cover diversity in a sample. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and metabolic potential of a temperate planktonic freshwater community and advances approaches for comparative metagenomics.					; Konstantinidis, Kostas/ABE-7113-2020; Oh, Seungdae/E-7293-2016	Konstantinidis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-0954-4755; Caro-Quintero, Alejandro/0000-0001-8807-671X; Oh, Seungdae/0000-0002-3171-3631; Tsementzi, Despina/0000-0002-4578-1918													0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2011	77	17					6000	6011		10.1128/AEM.00107-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00107-11								21764968					WOS:000294205700020

Because of the interplay between growth and reproduction, endocrine control of the growth axis is thought to have a connection to the reproductive axis. Seasonal patterns and relationships between IGF-1, fish condition, and gonadal development were investigated in a wild population of female Dolly Varden charr Salvelinus malma (Walbaum, 1792) during the summer growing season prior to spawning. Fish were sampled from Florence Lake, Alaska on five sequential sampling trips during April-October 2006. Body and gonad morphometric measurements, and blood plasma samples were obtained for IGF-I quantification. IGF-I increased during summer with fish condition. The gonadosomatic index indicated a pattern of advancing reproductive development in one cohort of fish by August, which indicated impending spawning compared to an immature (non-reproductive) cohort. However, plasma IGF-I levels were not predictive of the sexually maturing cohort. We conclude that IGF-I is not a useful endocrine marker of advancing reproductive state in female Dolly Varden charr but does relate to fish condition during the summer growth period.

This new standard has been incorporated in the latest Italian soil classification (UNI 11531-1:2014), substituting the previous one (UNI 10006:2002). A set of 28 soil samples was analysed: the research shows that LLcone is always greater than LLcup. According to the old standard, all samples were suitable for the works planned but, according to the new one, 18 % of samples became unsuitable. This is in spite of the fact that there is nothing to show that the old classification was "unsafe." The new standard (based on LLcone) restricts the choice of materials, so that not only will costs for earthworks increase in the future but, paradoxically, because of the new standard, thousands of kilometers of properly working old lev,es became suddenly "unsafe." The results suggest that soil classification criteria for earthworks should be reconsidered in order to transform the conventional "index properties" to sound physical characteristics.

It is also important in the diet of landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago). The vendace stock in lake Paasivesi has not recovered from a 10-year recession, and the number of stocked salmon has risen to a level where predation can contribute to the mortality of vendace. We constructed a model of the influence of salmon predation and commercial trawling on the mortality of 0+ vendace in this lake. Our analysis revealed that predation by salmon alone could cause a year-class failure with the present low level of vendace larvae in spring. With a high spring density, only a high trawling effort could thin the year-class to a low level. We recommended that in order to guarantee a high number of larvae in spring, the spawning stock biomass of vendace should be raised.																			0003-455X	1797-2450				FEB 26	2004	41	1					339	350																WOS:000220364300038

Aging of fish was done by reading otoliths and plotting length frequency histograms. Fish set the first ring, a false check, in otoliths within the first month of life and the annual ring is set by the adults on June 1 of the second summer of life. Culaea inconstans was generally found to be an annual fish which died after spawning in the second summer of life. A high positive correlation coefficient was found for body-otolith relationship.

To achieve this, multiple proxies, including diatoms, micro-XRF, carbon isotopic composition, and elemental carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, were analyzed. The diatom data indicated that water levels were high from 11.1 to 8.8 cal kyr BP, suggesting the lacustrine conditions, which likely outburst due to increased runoff conditions during 8.8 cal kyr BP. The Principal Component (PC) Analysis of the micro-XRF records from both cores showed a strong positive correlation between detrital proxy elements (Ti, Fe, K, and Si) and PC2 (PC2TTV-11 and PC2TTV-17), indicating higher/ lower runoff and wet/dry climate conditions. Overall, in the current study, TTV-11 core records showed a transition from wet to dry conditions during 13.3 to 11.0 cal kyr BP along with drier climate events during 12.9-12.6, 12.4-12.1, and 12.0-11.7 cal kyr BP, which coincided with the timing and duration of Younger Dryas event. After 11.7 cal kyr BP, the climate was transformed to wetter conditions towards 8.0 cal kyr BP, with intermittent drier climate events at 11.0, 10.3, and 8.2 cal kyr BP. In addition, the TTV-17 records showed wet climate conditions during 4.5-3.0, 2.0-1.7, 1.2-0.8, and 0.4-0.2 cal kyr BP. In contrast, dry climate conditions were noticed during 3.0-2.0, 1.7-1.2, and 0.8-0.4 cal kyr BP. The Mn/Fe ratios, inc/coh ratios, C and N contents, and PC2 suggested that organic matter dilution by inorganic (detrital) material during wetter climate conditions. The drier climate conditions occurred between 13.3 and 8.0 cal kyr BP were largely coincided with strong East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) and weak East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), which driven by Arctic ice sea expansion and low winter insolation, and dry climate conditions which occurred between 4.5 cal kyr BP to present, were response of negative Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. On the other hand, wet climate conditions observed in the current study were the response to strong EASM, a response to La-Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean, and weak EAWM due to positive AMOC.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2025	663								112775	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112775		FEB 2025											WOS:001424678600001

Thermal stratification patterns in urban ponds and their relationships with vertical nutrient gradients	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Ponds that collect and process stormwater have become a prominent feature of urban landscapes, especially in areas recently converted to residential land use in North America. Given their increasing number and their tight hydrological connection to residential catchments, these small aquatic ecosystems could play an important role in urban biogeochemistry. However, some physicochemical aspects of urban ponds remain poorly studied. Here we assessed the frequency and strength of water column stratification, using measurements of vertical water temperature profiles at high spatial and temporal frequency, in 10 shallow urban stormwater management ponds in southern Ontario, Canada. Many of the ponds were well stratified during much of the summer of 2010 as indicated by relatively high estimates of thermal resistance to mixing (RTRM) indices. Patterns of stratification reflected local weather conditions but also varied among ponds depending on their morphometric characteristics such as maximum water depth and surface area to perimeter ratio. We found greater vertical nutrient gradients and more phosphorus accumulation in bottom waters in ponds with strong and persistent stratification, which likely results from limited particle resuspension and more dissolved phosphorus (P) release from sediments. However, subsequent mixing events in the fall diminished vertical P gradients and possibly accelerated internal loading from the sediment water interface. Our results demonstrate that stormwater ponds can experience unexpectedly long and strong thermal stratification despite their small size and shallow water depth. Strong thermal stratification and episodic mixing in ponds likely alter the quantity and timing of internal nutrient loading, and hence affect water quality and aquatic communities in downstream receiving waters.

Annual and seasonal variability in tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus) diet in northern Alaska	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Within arctic ecosystems, rodents (voles and lemmings) influence plant community composition, soil nutrient availability, and carbon cycling through foraging and the deposition of waste. Yet, little is known about how rodent diet may vary seasonally and annually, particularly with fluctuations in population density. Here, we characterize diet composition of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in northern Alaska using stable isotope analysis of fecal and hair samples collected over a seven-year period, including a full "boom and bust" population cycle. Results from Bayesian mixing models from both fecal and hair samples suggest that tundra voles in northern Alaska predominately feed on the rhizomatous sedges Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex bigelowii throughout the summer. However, consumption shifts from rhizomes in early summer to tillers and buds in late summer. Tundra vole diets were broadly similar from year to year throughout the population cycle, although dietary niche breadth increased with population abundance. These findings on the selective dietary behavior of the tundra vole provide insight into plant-animal interactions in the Alaskan tundra, which may be disrupted under climate change or by shifts in other disturbance regimes.					; Stephens, Ryan/KHV-4378-2024	Rowe, Rebecca/0000-0002-0492-568X; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2025	57	1							2444044	10.1080/15230430.2024.2444044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2444044													WOS:001415478800001

To uncover the effects of summer high irradiance and temperature on cyanobacterial growth and beta-cyclocitral emission, the cell growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, photosynthetic pigment content, chlorophyll fluorescence and beta-cyclocitral emission were investigated in Microcystis aeruginosa under high light and temperature. Compared to the control under 50 mu mol m(-2).s(-1), the cell growth was promoted under 100 mu mol m(-2).s(-1), but inhibited under 500 and 1000 mu mol m(-2).s(-1). The inhibition was also detected under high temperature at 30 and 35 degrees C in contrast to the control at 25 degrees C. Under high light and high temperature, M. aeruginosa increased ROS levels and reduced photosynthetic pigment content and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, which resulted in the inhibition on cell growth. With increasing the light intensity and temperature, O-1(2) levels gradually increased, while beta-carotene content gradually decreased by quenching O-1(2), with increasing beta-cyclocitral emission. In summer, high irradiance and temperature not benefited the growth of cyanobacteria, but the emission of beta-cyclocitral derived from beta-carotene quenching O-1(2) may offset the disadvantages by poisoning other algae.

J	Changnon, D				Changnon, David			A Spatial and Temporal Analysis of 30-Day Heavy Snowfall Amounts in the Eastern United States, 1900-2016	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Heavy 30-day snowfall amounts were evaluated to identify spatial and temporal characteristics east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States during the period 1900-2016. An extensive data assessment identified 507 stations for use in this long-term climate study. The top 30-day heavy snowfall amount and the average of the top five 30-day heavy snowfall amounts were examined. Both amounts generally increased with latitude; however, much higher amounts were found downwind of the Great Lakes, at higher elevations, or in locations impacted by topographic features (e.g., Rockies, Black Hills, and Appalachians). When compared with the 1981-2010 average winter snowfall, the top 30-day amount was found to be greater than the winter average in most areas of the eastern United States. The number of stations experiencing a top-five 30-day heavy snowfall period in a winter ranged from 1 to 128 (1959/60), with a greater overall occurrence in the second half of the 117-yr period. Six episodes had 10% or more stations experiencing one of the top five 30-day snowfall amounts, with the February-March 1960 episode impacting 124 stations, and these episodes were associated with large negative 500-hPa height anomalies. The northern Great Plains, Great Lakes, Midwest, and Northeast experienced more top-five periods in the second half of the 117-yr period, whereas most of the southern states experienced top-five periods throughout the study's time frame. Examining extremes at periods beyond the daily event and less than the season contributes to our knowledge of climate and provides useful information to snow-sensitive sectors.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				FEB	2018	57	2					319	331		10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0217.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0217.1													WOS:000427362400007

Optimizing Survey Design for Shasta Salamanders (Hydromantes spp.) to Estimate Occurrence in Little-Studied Portions of their Range	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Shasta salamanders (collectively, Hydromantes samweli, H. shastae, and H. wintu; hereafter, Shasta salamander) are endemic to northern California in the general vicinity of Shasta Lake reservoir. Although generally associated with limestone, they have repeatedly been found in association with other habitats, calling into question the distribution of the species complex. Further limiting our knowledge of the species' distributions is that they are only active or available for sampling on the soil surface for a small portion of the year, and detection probabilities for the species have never been estimated. We developed and implemented a survey protocol designed to estimate detection, availability, and occurrence probabilities from December 2019 through March 2020. We provide inference on Shasta salamander occurrence in portions of their range that have received little survey effort. We found that Shasta salamander occurrence was positively associated with the percent cover of embedded rock, and the species' availability (i.e., probability of being active on the soil surface during sampling) was positively related to relative humidity. The probability of occurrence of Shasta salamanders in our study area was low, and our winter-to-spring survey protocol was effective for estimating detection, availability, and occurrence probabilities in the study area and at specific sites. We suggest that conducting replicate surveys that quantify animal availability and detection probabilities will facilitate a better understanding of the habitat associations of Shasta salamanders and other rare species that might often be unavailable for detection.

Andres			Under-Ice Population Density Estimation of Alaska Blackfish	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Alaska Blackfish Dallia pectoralis is an understudied but ecologically important mudminnow occurring in lentic ecosystems of subarctic and Arctic Alaska. We sampled a population of Alaska Blackfish during the winter months in an upland pond near Fairbanks, Alaska, and we used a simple mark-recapture estimator to provide the first population estimate for this species. We found that Alaska Blackfish density in the pond was approximately 0.27individuals/m(2), equating to an estimated biomass of 15g/m(2) of pond surface area, which is similar to density estimates reported for other mudminnow species. We tested capture methods and found that under-ice minnow trapping was a poor method during early winter (September-December) but was highly effective near methane sumps and areas of high muskrat Ondatra zibethicus activity in late winter (March-April). Qualitatively, nearshore minnow trapping, seining, and kicknetting during the ice-free season were less effective than under-ice trapping. Cursorily, pelvic fin clips were more effective for batch marking of Alaska Blackfish than two types of subcutaneous tags, given the high numbers of individuals we captured and the species' relatively small body size and dark skin, which hindered tag visualization. We demonstrated that Alaska Blackfish can occur at high densities in their typical habitat, underscoring their importance as forage fish in Alaskan freshwater ecosystems that support subsistence and sport fisheries for piscivorous fishes. Extending this approach across the geographic range of Alaska Blackfish will improve understanding of the ecological role of this species in the varying aquatic ecosystems where it occurs.

Reconstructing the Glacial History of Green Lakes Valley, North Boulder Creek, Colorado Front Range	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We document the post Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) deglaciation history of a small catchment in Colorado's Front Range and model the glacial history responsible. We combine cosmogenic exposure dating of moraine boulders and glacial polish from 10 sites down the valley axis with a set of 1-D and 2-D numerical glacier models in which climate is represented by prescribed winter and summer mass balance profiles. Moraine ages of 24-18 ka constrain the LGM maximum glacial extent at 15 km downvalley from the range crest. Glacial polish sites decline in age along the center portion of the valley, dropping to roughly 12 ka by 5 km from the crest. This supports a monotonic but non-steady decline in glacier length. Modeling of the deglaciation history reveals that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) rise from similar to 18 ka to similar to 14 ka was between 250 and 350 m, and that from similar to 14 ka to similar to 12 ka was between 100 and 150 m. Complete deglaciation requires at least another 250-300 m of ELA rise. A transient model run employing this ELA history can both reproduce the spatio-temporal pattern of glacial polish ages, and honor the constraints on maximum glacial extent. The full deglaciation between 18 ka and 10 ka can be modeled successfully with a 4.5-6 degrees C temperature rise and little to no change in precipitation.

During austral summer 2002-2003 the total dissolved Cu ([CU](T)), the concentration of strong CU2+ -binding ligands ([L](T)), and their conditional stability constant K" were determined in surface samples of all six lakes. All lakes exhibited appreciable concentrations of a strong Cu2+ binding ligand with similar V values and concentrations always exceeding [CUT], thus dominating CU2+ speciation. Four lakes (Hayes, Manapouri, Wanaka, Te Anau) showed no appreciable trend in [L-T] throughout the summer, whereas in Lakes Wakatipu and Hawea [L-T] increased steadily throughout this period. Laboratory UVB irradiation of lake water samples using a 400 W mercury lamp with a Pyrex glass filter (lambda > 280 nm) showed that Cu2+-binding ligands are destroyed by UVB radiation, causing [L](T) to decrease with a rate of -0.588 nmol L-1 h(-1) (r(2) 0.88). From this we calculate that the in situ ligand destruction rate by UVB in summer for surface waters of these lakes is too small to significantly affect [L-T], and conclude that variations in ligand concentrations must result from seasonally variable biological factors.

J	Davidson, NL; Kelso, WE; Rutherford, DA				Davidson, NL; Kelso, WE; Rutherford, DA			Relationships between environmental variables and the abundance of cladocerans and copepods in the Atchafalaya River Basin	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationship of species abundance to eight environmental variables was tested for 24 common species of crustacean zooplankton collected in the Atchafalaya River Basin during the summer of 1994. Stepwise regressions (alpha = 0.05) revealed significant relationships between zooplankton abundance and at least one environmental variable for is species (R-2 = 0.14 - 0.61, p < 0.0435 - 0.0001). The majority of these species' peak abundances were correlated with variables indicative of seasonal changes in floodplain habitat, as the Atchafalaya river receded, water temperature increased, and/or phytoplanktonic photosynthesis increased. Surface water temperature and the percent saturation of dissolved oxygen showed the most significant relationships, but specific conductance, current velocity, and Secchi disk depths were also related to abundance patterns of certain taxa. A principal components analysis of species abundances provided further insight into the partitioning of temporally-distinct zooplanton assemblages, showing that several species (Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia parvula, Eurytemora affinis, and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula) predominated during early summer, and were supplanted by a distinct late-summer assemblage (Diaphanosoma birgei, Moina micrura, Mesocyclops edax, and Daphnia lumholtzi) as time progressed. The transitional assemblage was dominated by Simocephalus serrulatus, Macrocyclops albidus, Microcyclops rubellus, and Thermocyclops inversus, all of which were most abundant in the hypoxic conditions characteristic of the latter stages of the Atchafalaya River flood-pulse.																			0018-8158						1998	379						175	181																WOS:000078311500018

We conducted a comprehensive year-long investigation into the occurrence, spatiotemporal variations, risk assessment, and correlation with environmental factors of 18 antibiotics in the Zipingpu Reservoir, a major drinking water reservoir. The total concentration of antibiotics in the reservoir ranged from 4.64 ng/L to 343.28 ng/L, with penicillin G being the predominant contaminant. Seasonal variations showed that antibiotic concentrations were higher in winter and spring. Hydrological conditions and antibiotic usage patterns, through seasonal variations, influence both the prevalence and environmental trajectory of antibiotics. Our results underscored the critical roles of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), the humification index (HIX), and the heavy metal cation Ba. The reservoir indirectly contributes to the reduction of antibiotic occurrence levels through its capability to transport, transform, and deposit dissolved organic carbon (DOC), TDN, TDP, and heavy metals. Ecological risk assessment revealed that penicillin G posed an exceptionally high risk (RQ(max) = 53.35) with a 44% high-risk detection rate and a 45.8% moderate-risk detection rate, while erythromycin (RQ(max) = 2.55) and omeprazole (RQ(max) = 1.70) showed 1.6% high-risk detection rates. Human health risk assessment indicated that dimetridazole presented a high risk (HQ(max) = 1.31) to infants aged 0-6 months, with metronidazole, ronidazole, and penicillin G also showing potential risks (HQ > 0.001). Penicillin G, dimetridazole, and metronidazole serve as important indicators for future studies assessing the risks of antibiotics in the Zipingpu Reservoir.

In this study, we present a high-resolution temperature reconstruction (similar to 10-year resolution) for the past two millennia, using branched dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from the laminated sediments of Lake Shuanggoushan in Northeast China. Our reconstruction of month-above-freezing temperatures (MAFT) revealed significant temperature variability on decadal to centennial timescales, which aligns well with other paleotemperature records from Northeast China but diverges from the composite temperature series of the broader Chinese region. In this region, instrumental records revealed a strong positive correlation between the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and winter-spring temperatures (Nov-Apr), with a weaker correlation during the ice-free season (May-Oct). Paleoclimate records further demonstrate a weak positive correlation (r = 0.22, p < 0.01) between the AO index and MAFTs on decadal timescales, suggesting that the AO has influenced regional temperature variability over the past 2000 years. Spectral analysis of the temperature time series identified two periodicities (55-57 and 66-67 years) with 99 % confidence, which closely align with the similar to 60-year solar cycle. This finding indicated a possible link between temperature variability and solar activity. Overall, our results highlight the significance of the AO and solar activity in driving decadal temperature variability during ice-free seasons in Northeast China over the past two millennia.

J	Boyne, AW				Boyne, Andrew W.			Harlequin Ducks in the Canadian Maritime Provinces	WATERBIRDS												Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) area relatively rare species in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. Recent confirmed breeding records are restricted to northern New Brunswick. Sightings of small numbers of birds during the molting and staging periods occur in all three provinces. It is estimated that New Brunswick supports as many as 200 wintering Harlequin Ducks, and almost 600 winter off the coast of Nova Scotia, although due to the extent of coast and occasional sightings of Harlequin Ducks from previously unknown locations, it is likely that these are minimum estimates, particularly for Nova Scotia. Few trend data are available in the Maritimes, but available information suggests an increase in the last five years. Hunting, both intentional and unintentional, still occurs; hunter education and enforcement to stop the Lake of this species could be worthwhile. Coastal development, including vacation home building and aquaculture sites, are occurring in places where Harlequin Ducks winter. There is a general need to monitor the impacts of these developments on local Harlequin Duck populations.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2008	31				2		50	57																WOS:000263006600008
J	Heiri, O; Lotter, AF; Hausmann, S; Kienast, F				Heiri, O; Lotter, AF; Hausmann, S; Kienast, F			A chironomid-based Holocene summer air temperature reconstruction from the Swiss Alps	HOLOCENE												We developed a quantitative chironomid-July air temperature inference model based on surface sediments from 81 Swiss lakes and applied it to the Holocene subfossil chironomid record of Hinterburgsee, a small subalpine lake in the northern Swiss Alps (present-day mean July air temperature of 11.3degreesC). After smoothing to reduce the high between-sample variability of inferred temperatures, the reconstruction indicates July air temperatures of 10.4-10.9degreesC at the end of the Younger Dryas, of 11.9-12.8degreesC during the early and mid-Holocene (11500-4000 cal. BP), and slightly lower temperatures of 11.5-12.0degreesC during the late Holocene (3500-1000 cal. BP). A warming trend inferred for the past millennium is most likely an artifact of human impact on Hinterburgsee's chironomid fauna, rather than a genuine temperature signal. The most prominent climatological events during the Holocene were two periods of lower temperatures at c. 10700-10500 cal. BP and 8200-7700 cal. BP and an abrupt shift to a cooler late-Holocene climate around 4000-3700 cal. BP. Although the chironomid-inferred climate signals were within the prediction error of the model (1.51degreesC), major inferred temperature changes agree well with other northern and central European climate reconstructions and underline the potential of subfossil chironomid analysis to reconstruct even the moderate climatic changes within the Holocene.

Summer sea-surface salinity (SSS) was reconstructed using a weighted averaging partial least squares diatom-based training set. The reconstructed SSS shows slightly decreasing values during the period AD 9051930 with considerable fluctuations superimposed on this general trend. Relatively high-salinity conditions during the interval AD 9051450 probably suggest a low flood frequency in north-eastern Taiwan. Furthermore, the high SSS values are associated with a strong and stable influence of the Kuroshio Current on the Southern Okinawa Trough during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The period AD 14501930 is characterized by three low-salinity intervals (AD 14501500, AD 16251725 and AD 17701880) separated by periods of relatively high salinity. The low SSS intervals indicate increased freshwater discharge into the Southern Okinawa Trough during the Little Ice Age, probably as a result of higher flood frequencies in north-eastern Taiwan. Spectral and wavelet analyses suggest that this pattern was linked to multidecadal variations in summer SSS, presumably associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

Sulfide has been suggested as an electron donor for autotrophic growth in microbial mats dominated with C. aggregans, but remarkable photoautotrophic growth of isolated C. aggregans has not been observed with sulfide as the sole electron source. From the idea that sulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur by C. aggregans and the accumulation of elemental sulfur may have an inhibitory effect for the growth, the effects of an elemental sulfur-disproportionating bacterium that consumes elemental sulfur was examined on the autotrophic growth of C. aggregans, strain NA9-6, isolated from Nakabusa hot spring. A sulfur-disproportionating bacterium, Caldimicrobium thiodismutans strain TF1, also isolated from Nakabusa hot spring was co-cultured with C. aggregans. C. aggregans and C. thiodismutans were successfully co-cultured in a medium containing thiosulfate as the sole electron source and bicarbonate as the sole carbon source. Quantitative conversion of thiosulfate to sulfate and a small transient accumulation of sulfide was observed in the co-culture. Then the electron source of the established co-culture was changed from thiosulfate to sulfide, and the growth of C. aggregans and C. thiodismutans was successfully observed with sulfide as the sole electron donor for the autotrophic growth of the co-culture. During the cultivation in the light, simultaneous consumption and accumulation of sulfide and sulfate, respectively, were observed, accompanied with the increase of cellular DNAs of both species. C. thiodismutans likely works as an elemental sulfur scavenger for C. aggregans, and C. aggregans seems to work as a sulfide scavenger for C. thiodismutans. These results suggest that C. aggregans grows autotrophically with sulfide as the electron donor in the co-culture with C. thiodismutans, and the consumption of elemental sulfur by C. thiodismutans enabled the continuous growth of the C. aggregans in the symbiotic system. This study shows a novel symbiotic relationship between a sulfide-oxidizing photoautotroph and an elemental sulfur-disproportionating chemolithoautotroph via cooperative dissimilatory sulfide oxidation to sulfate.

There are no data on structural changes in the cytoplasm and their relationship with changes in the composition of fatty acids in the course of mixotrophic culturing of freshwater diatoms. To elucidate the role of lipids in the growth of diatom cells in autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures, it is necessary to obtain information on the distribution of fatty acids among intracellular compartments and on possible ultrastructural changes in the cells. Results: In this study, the results demonstrated that Synedra acus cells cultured in the presence of 80 mM glycerol contained lipid bodies of increased size, while cells from cultures supplemented with 40 mM glucose accumulated polysaccharide (chrysolaminarin) granules. An increase in the relative amounts of palmitic and stearic acids was revealed at the exponential growth phase of S. acus in the medium with 80 mM glycerol, which was indicative of the accumulation of fatty acids contained in triacylglycerols. Conclusions: Synedra acus subsp. radians have an ability to proliferate in the presence of high concentrations of organic substances and their transport into cells is evidence for its high adaptation potential, which, along with other factors, accounts for the dominance of this diatom in the spring-summer plankton of the oligotrophic Lake Baikal.

Here, we present a 15-ka record of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in a closed lake in northern China to address this issue. Surface and downcore sediment data demonstrate sedimentary GDGT-0 and branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) are of aquatic production. Contents of GDGT-0 and brGDGTs increase but brGDGT-based paleo-temperature proxy decreases with water depth in surface sediments along a nearshore to offshore transect. This trend is likely due to an increasingly hypoxic condition, favored by anaerobic microbes producing these GDGT-0 and brGDGTs, in bottom water. Accordingly, brGDGT-derived water temperature and pH would reflect bottom water conditions that are largely regulated by water depth of the lake. Downcore GDGT data and their derived temperature and pH consistently reveal a gradually increasing lake level from the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene, a high level during 9.5-5 ka BP and a decreasing trend afterward. The lake-level records from independent and robust proxies in this study largely agree with pollen records in the region, supporting a mid-Holocene maximum EASM precipitation.

Climate change impact on water resources availability in the kiltie watershed, Lake Tana sub-basin, Ethiopia	HELIYON												Climate change's influence on water resource availability in watersheds must be evaluated to ensure food and water security. Using an ensemble of two global climate models (MIROC and MPI) and one regional climate model (RCA4), the impact of climate change on the availability of water in the Kiltie watershed was evaluated under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the year 2040s and 2070s. The flow was simulated using the HBV hydrological model, which needs fewer data and is typically employed in data-scarce settings. The model calibration and validation result, show RVE (relative volume error) of -1.27% and 6.93%, and NSE of 0.63 and 0.64 respectively. Seasonal Water Supply in the Future Under the RCP4.5 Scenario for the 2040s increased between 1.1 mm and 33.2 mm showing maximum incremental in August and a decrease in a range from 0.23 mm to 6.89 mm with a maximum decrease in September. While in the 2070s, water availability increases between 7.2 mm and 56.9 mm, with the largest increases occurring in October and the smallest reductions occurring in July by 9 mm. Future water availability increases under the RCP8.5 scenario during the 2040s period between 4.1 mm and 38.8 mm, with the highest increase occurring in August, and falls between 9.8 mm and 31.2 mm, with the maximum declines occurring in the spring seasons. Water availability in the 2070s, according to the RCP8.5 scenario, increases between 2.7 mm and 42.4 mm with the highest in-crements in August, and it decreases between 1.8 mm and 80.3 mm with maximum decreases in June. According to this study, climate change would make it easier to access water during the rainy season, necessitating the construction of water storage facilities so that surplus water can be used for dry farming. A watershed-level integrated water resource management strategy should be created quickly as future water supply will decline during the dry seasons.

Establishment of Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) as a Primary Pest of Corn in the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Western bean cutworm, Stroacpsta albicosta Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a pest of corn, Zea maize L., and dry edible beans, Phaseolus sp. L., native to the western United States. Following the range expansion into the U.S. Corn Belt, pheromone trap monitoring began in the Great Lakes region in 2006.The first S. albicosta was captured in Michigan in 2006 and in Ontario, Canada in 2008. Pheromone traps were used to document spread and increasing captures of S. albicosta across Michigan and Ontario until 2012. Trapping confirmed the univoltine life cycle of S. albicosta in this region and identified peak flight, typically occurring in late July. Overwintering of S. albicosta in this region was confirmed by emergence from infested fields and overwintering experiments. Multiple soil textures were infested with prepupae, and recovery was assessed throughout the winter. Overwintering success was not affected by soil texture, however, prepupae were found at greater depths in coarse-textured soils Soil temperatures at overwintering depths did not reach the supercooling point Injury to corn by S. albicosta increased in incidence, severity and geographic range from 2010 to 2014 in field plots. Decreasing control of injury by Cry 1F corn hybrids was observed over time.These findings show that S. albicosta has established as a perennial corn pest in the Great Lakes region due to observations of overwintering success and unmanaged injury. We recommend S. albicosta obtain primary pest status in this region within regulatory framework and a resistance management plan be required for traits targeting this pest.

The devices were deployed for 14 days at each sampling site in spring and summer of 2011. Time weighted average (TWA) concentrations of the water-borne contaminants were calculated from the amounts of analytes accumulated in the passive samplers. In the area of interest, concentrations of analytes in water ranged from 33.5 to 126.8 ng l(-1) for PAHs, from 20.9 to 120.9 pg l(-1) for PCBs and from 0.2 to 36.9 ng l(-1) for OCPs. Chlorinated pesticides were mainly composed of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (0.15-36.9 ng l(-1)) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloromethane (DDT) with its metabolites (0.03-0.55 ng l(-1)). By applying diagnostic ratios of certain PAHs, identification of possible sources of the contaminants in the various sampling sites was performed. These ratios were generally inclined towards pyrogenic sources of pollution by PAHs in all study sites except in the Centurion River (CR), Centurion Lake (CL) and Airport River (AUP) that indicated petrogenic origins. This study highlights further need to map up the temporal and spatial variations of these POPs using passive samplers.					; Tölgyessy, Peter/C-3628-2017; Kukucka, Petr/F-7064-2016; chimuka, luke/LOR-9818-2024; Vrana, Branislav/J-1905-2019	Kukucka, Petr/0000-0003-1733-8334; Tolgyessy, Peter/0000-0003-4680-7371; Chimuka, Luke/0000-0002-8552-2478; Vrana, Branislav/0000-0003-4221-5774													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2014	186	9					5639	5653		10.1007/s10661-014-3809-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3809-3								24869948					WOS:000339827500027

Taking advantage of this significant tidal range, the Rance tidal power station (RTPS) was built in the 1960s as the world's first and largest tidal power plant, with peak output capacity of 240 Megawatts. It is currently the second world's largest tidal power installation after the Sihwa-Lake tidal barrage. The RTPS has two active parts: a barrage of 6 sluice gates and a structure of 24 turbines. Despite a well-known effect of the plant on damping estuarine water levels, little attention has been given to currents vertical distribution and the plant's impact on the dynamics of freshwater-saltwater interface. Therefore, a three-dimensional model of the Rance estuary was developed. Moreover, currents and salinity measurements were carried out to validate the numerical model. Simulated and measured currents showed that (i)the RTPS induces an acceleration of flood currents directly upstream of the sluice gates and (ii)ebb currents are strengthened by the narrowness of the Saint-Hubert-Port. Finally, salinity analyses assessed the dynamics of the freshwater-saltwater interface which is pushed further upstream during summer.

J	Kloiber, SM; Brezonik, PL; Bauer, ME				Kloiber, SM; Brezonik, PL; Bauer, ME			Application of Landsat imagery to regional-scale assessments of lake clarity	WATER RESEARCH												A procedure that uses Landsat imagery to estimate Secchi disk transparency (SDT) of lakes was developed and applied to similar to 500 lakes with surface areas > 10ha in the seven-county metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, USA, to assess spatial patterns and temporal trends in lake clarity. Thirteen Landsat MSS and TM images over the period 1973-1998 were used for the analysis. Satellite brightness values from lake surfaces were calibrated against available historical data on SDT (n = similar to 20-40) measured nearly contemporaneously with the acquisition date of each image. Calibration regression equations for the late-summer TM images had a range of r(2) from 0.72 to 0.93. Regression analysis for three late-summer MSS images yielded r(2) values ranging from 0.60 to 0.79. Results indicate that a single late-summer image yields a reliable estimate of regional lake clarity and reasonably accurate estimates of SDT for individual lakes. An analysis of seasonal patterns on a large lake water-quality database was used to develop a model that adjusts synoptic satellite SDT estimates from different dates to a common reference, making them more comparable from year-to-year. Analysis of long-term trends shows that in spite of the large land-use changes within the region over the study period, only 49 (about 10%) of assessed lakes in the region showed significant temporal trends in SDT over the period, and more lakes had increasing SDT (34) than decreasing SDT (15).

J	Tokatli, C				Tokatli, Cem			Comparisons of diatoms and fishes as toxic metal bioindicator: a case study of an A-class wetland in northwest Turkey under effect of an intensive paddy cultivation stress	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this research, diatoms as the first step and fishes as the last step of the food chain were compared as toxic metal accumulation bioindicator in an A-class wetland in Turkey. Bioaccumulations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) were determined in liver, gill and muscle tissues of two commercially consumed fish species Carassius gibelio and Cyprinus carpio and in frustules of epiphytic diatom communities living on submerged macrophytes. Samples were collected seasonally from the Gala Lake, which is among the best stopover habitats of birds migrating between Europe and Africa, considering the paddy harvest period that is a major stress factor for the ecosystem. Also, potential human health risks associated with the consumption of fishes and consumption - dermal contact of diatoms were evaluated both for summer - before paddy harvest (BPH) and autumn - after paddy harvest (APH) periods. As a result of this research, the investigated toxic metal concentrations were increased significantly in diatoms in the APH period, while less significant exchanges were recorded in fishes. The bioaccumulations of PTEs were ranked as follows: Zn > Mn > Se> Cu > B > Cr > Ni > As > Pb > Cd for C. gibelio; Zn > Mn > Se > Cu > B > Cr > As > Ni > Pb > Cd for C. carpio; andMn>Zn>Se>Pb>B>Ni>Cr>Cu>As>Cd for diatom frustules. Although the HI values in diatoms detected in the APH period were statistically significantly higher (about 1000 times; p< 0.05) than detected in the BPH period, they were less than the limit of 1 in both seasons. However, the HI coefficients of fishes were quite higher than the limit (an average of 23.59 for C. gibelio and 19.18 for C. carpio), which means quite high probable non-carcinogenic health risks for humans. Furthermore, the CR coefficients of Cr, Ni and As in muscle tissues of fishes were considerably higher than the limit of 10(-4), which reflects a significant carcinogenic health risk for consumers. The data showed that although the fishes at the top of the food chain bioaccumulate the PTEs in their tissues much higher than the diatoms at the bottom of the food chain, the diatoms are much more sensitive to changes in the environmental conditions than the fishes and they are more effective biological tools as toxic metal accumulation bioindicators.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2022	29	58					87231	87244		10.1007/s11356-022-21903-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21903-6		JUL 2022						35802324					WOS:000824989700018
J	NEWCOMBE, CL				NEWCOMBE, CL			A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF ATTACHMENT MATERIALS IN SODON LAKE, MICHIGAN	ECOLOGY												This paper embodies the results of 10 slide rack expts. conducted in Sodon and Walnut Lakes, s.-e. Michigan, during the period June 10-Nov. 23, 1947. The max. wt. of attachment material obtained at the 1.2 m. level in Sodon L. was approx. 20 m. per sq. dm. area per 10 day period during the interval from Aug. 17 until Sept. 19, 1947. There was a pronounced decline to about 9 mg. for each of the 2 succeeding fall periods ending Nov. 23. A progressive increase in wt. of attachment material at the 4.8 m. level was observed from the period June 10-August 14 when the wt. was 1.15 mg. to the interval Oct. 24-Nov. 23 at which time the wt. amounted to 14.31 mg. per sq. dm. area per 10-day period. This trend is attributed in large part to an increase in the productivity of a gradually deepening surface stratum of water brought about by lower fall temps. A small difference in depth of the attachment surface is a dominant factor in determining the wt. of slide material. By employing this relation, it seems likely that a useful expression of actual production rate may be developed. During summer the productive stratum of Sodon L. extends to a depth of about 3 m. This level is suggested by the vertical expts. and by the conspicuous zona-tion on rope supports. Unexpectedly, no significant difference was observed between the wts. obtained at station 1 in the center of the lake and those at station 5 in the littoral zone, depth 1.2 m. Here, the percentage organic matter ranged from 43 to 50, for the top slide-surface materials. Usually, higher percentages were found for the under slide-surface, due in large part to lack of exposure to descending inorganic particulate matter and also because of the greater margin of exptl. error resulting from the smaller amt. of material present. A presentation of certain points bearing on the validity of attachment material for indicating water productivity is given. Also, suggested means for improving and standardizing a suitable "seeding-on" technic are treated briefly.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1950	31	2					204	215		10.2307/1932387	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932387													WOS:A1950XW60200004
J	Walker, D				Walker, D.			Holocene sediments of Lake Barrine, north-east Australia, and their implications for the history of lake and catchment environments	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Barrine (17 degrees 15' S, 145 degrees 38' E, 721 m a.s.l.) lies in a maar crater surrounded by tropical rainforest. Its surface area is 1 km(2) and its maximum depth 67 m. It has no inflow streams and an outlet only active in the wet summer months. The sediments underlying the lake have been investigated by numerous Mackereth cores and in-situ frozen slabs. In addition to lithological descriptions, selected samples have been analysed for grain size, bulk density and combustible content, mineralogy and chemistry, palaeomagnetism, pollen and charcoal. A chronology was established from radiocarbon dating of 211 sediment samples. The deposits are divisible into three main strata. Between about 16 ka and 9.7 ka cal BP they are mainly inorganic representing occasional, very energetic, inwash from the lightly vegetated inner walls of the crater, only a few small enclaves were perennially flooded. Between 9.7 and 5.4 ka cal BP sediments were, for the most part, finely grained with a substantial organic component. Their indications are of a water level rising overall but not at a constant rate. From time to time erosion and redeposition of marginal materials and older sediments took place. By 7.3 ka BP, as rainforest began to cover the catchment, the water level had risen sufficiently for reducing conditions to be established in its deeps and subsequent deposits indicated pedogenesis beneath the forest and reduced runoff to the lake. Between 9.7 and 7.3 ka cal BP the catchment erosion rate was 859 kg (dry wt) ha(-1) ka(-1) but this fell to 267 kg ha(-1) ka(-1) from 7.3 to 5.4 ka cal BP. From 5.4 ka cal BP to the present, the sediments beneath >55 m of the modem lake are strongly and finely laminated. This was the result of intermittent relocation of detritus from shallower to deeper water when the lake's thermal stability was reduced by unusually low winter temperatures, the resultant lamination being preserved under a persistent monimolimmon. Lamination counts indicate that this has happened more than a thousand times in the last 5.4 ka. By 3.2 ka cal BP the water level had reached the modem outlet and its oscillations thereby minimised. Between 5.4 ka cal BP and 3.2 ka cal BP, the catchment sediment yield was 112 kg ha(-1) ka(-1), rising to 146 kg ha(-1) ka(-1) thereafter. In the period between 9.7 and 3.2 ka cal BP the lake volume increased from virtually nothing to almost 36 Gl. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jungers, MC; Heimsath, AM				Jungers, Matthew C.; Heimsath, Arjun M.			Post-tectonic landscape evolution of a coupled basin and range: Pinaleno Mountains and Safford Basin, southeastern Arizona	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Pinaleno Mountains and adjacent Safford Basin are a landscape defined by the extensional tectonics of the Basin and Range physiographic province. However, over the last similar to 4 m.y., this coupled basin and range have been actively degrading in the absence of widespread regional extension. While rates of relief generation and upland erosion during active subsidence ca. 12-5 Ma are reflected in the geometry of the basin's structure and the stratigraphy it contains, rates of post-tectonic landscape evolution from the Pliocene to the present have been heretofore unknown. We combined topographic analyses of the Pinaleno Mountains with cosmogenic nuclide-derived catchmentaveraged erosion rates and burial dates of axial and piedmont deposits to quantify rates of post-tectonic landscape evolution and define a chronology for the last stages of deposition and subsequent incision in Safford Basin. In addition to constraining the timing of a deposit's formation, cosmogenic nuclide burial dates provide paleo-upland erosion rates at the time of deposition. Erosion rates in the Pinaleno Mountains have been generally moderate over the past 4 m.y., ranging between similar to 30 and 60 m/m.y. with no strong relationship to the drainage basins' modern topography. A potential acceleration of erosion rates to 100-250 m/m.y. between 3.5 and 2 Ma correlates with an inferred period of enhanced precipitation as well as the arrival from upstream of the Gila River in Safford Basin sometime shortly before 2.8 Ma. Widespread incision of Safford Basin was under way by ca. 2 Ma, as recorded by the dissection of piedmont basin highstand deposits (Frye Mesa) and two intermediate Gila River terraces on the northeast margin of Safford Basin (dated to 1.8 Ma and 0.64 Ma). Gila River incision rates have ranged from 30 to 60 m/m.y. over the past 3 m.y. Paleo-upland erosion rates and modern millennial-scale upland erosion rates fall within the same range as incision rates of the Gila River in Safford Basin, suggesting that upland erosion rates are predominantly a function of baselevel fall driven by axial incision. However, based on similarities between catchmentaveraged erosion rates and topography from basins draining into the integrated Safford Basin and the still internally drained Sulphur Springs Basin to the south, it appears that upland erosion rates during the Quaternary are not being driven exclusively by regional incision rates.

J	Agrell, C; Larsson, P; Okla, L; Agrell, J				Agrell, C; Larsson, P; Okla, L; Agrell, J			PCB congeners in precipitation, wash out ratios and depositional fluxes within the Baltic Sea region, Europe	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Concentrations of PCB congeners were determined in precipitation and the annual and seasonal depositional fluxes were calculated for 16 (mostly rural) stations around the Baltic Sea during 1990-1993. The concentrations of individual congeners in precipitation were found to be influenced by atmospheric concentrations of PCBs, ambient temperature, precipitation volume and physico-chemical properties of the compounds. Median levels of PCBs in precipitation differed one order of magnitude between stations. When analyzing all data together to obtain regional trends, concentrations of PCBs in precipitation decreased with increasing temperature. This relationship was the same for all stations but differed in the magnitude of the slope for individual congeners. Low chlorinated PCB congeners showed steeper slopes for the temperature relationship than did high chlorinated congeners, a result explained by high atmospheric concentrations of the low chlorinated congeners during low temperatures. Annual wash out ratios were between 31 and 72 x 103 and tended to be higher for the high chlorinated congeners. Wash out ratios decreased with increasing temperature for all congeners except PCB-33. At snow scavenging events, the wash out ratio of PCBs increased with a factor of 2. Latitudinal trends for PCB concentrations in precipitation and deposition were generally not statistically significant. The calculated yearly deposition of PCBs to the Baltic Sea was 390 and 5-18 kg for individual congeners, with PCB-138 having the highest flux. Deposition of PCB congeners varied seasonally, with a factor between 2 and 3, and was generally highest during fall. Relatively higher deposition of low chlorinated congeners compared to high chlorinated congeners was found during winter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Simulating the hydrological impacts of land use conversion from annual cropto perennial forage in the Canadian Prairies using the Cold RegionsHydrological Modelling platform	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Red River is one of the largest contributing sources of discharge and nutrients to the world's 10th largest freshwater lake, Lake Winnipeg. Conversion of large areas of annual cropland to perennial forage has been proposed as a strategy to reduce both flooding and nutrient export to Lake Winnipeg. Such reductions could occur either via a reduction in the concentration of nutrients in runoff or through changes in the basin-scale hydrology, resulting in a lower water yield and the concomitant export of nutrients. This study assessed the latter mechanism by using the physically based Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to examine the hydrological impacts of land use conversion from annual crops to perennial forage in a subbasin of the La Salle River basin in Canada. This basin is a typical agricultural subbasin in the Red River Valley, characterised by flat topography, clay soils, and a cold subhumid, continental climate. Long-term simulations (1992-2013) of the major components of water balance were compared between canola and smooth bromegrass, representing a conversion from annual cropping systems to perennial forage. An uncertainty framework was used to represent a range of fall soil saturation status (0 % to 70 %), which governs the infiltration to frozen soil in the subsequent spring. The model simulations indicated that, on average, there was a 36.5 +/- 6.6 % (36.5 +/- 7.2 mm) reduction in annual cumulative discharge and a 29.9 +/- 16.3 % (2.6 +/- 1.6 m3 s-1) reduction in annual peak discharge due to forage conversion over the assessed period. These reductions were driven by reduced overland flow 52.9 +/- 12.8 % (28.8 +/- 10.1 mm), increased peak snowpack (8.1 +/- 1.5 %, 7.8 +/- 1.6 mm), and enhanced infiltration to frozen soils (66.7 +/- 7.7 %, 141.5 +/- 15.2 mm). Higher cumulative evapotranspiration (ET) from perennial forage (34.5 +/- 0.9 %, 94.1 +/- 2.5 mm) was also predicted by the simulations. Overall, daily soil moisture under perennial forage was 18.0 % (57.2 +/- 1.2 mm) higher than that of crop simulation, likely due to the higher snow water equivalent (SWE) and enhanced infiltration. However, the impact of forage conversion on daily soil moisture varied interannually. Soil moisture under perennial forage stands could be either higher or lower than that of annual crops, depending on antecedent spring snowmelt infiltration volumes.					; Pomeroy, John W./A-8589-2013; Liang, Kang/GLQ-5335-2022; Pomeroy, John/IZE-0873-2023	Fang, Xing/0000-0002-4333-4815; Pomeroy, John W./0000-0002-4782-7457; Liang, Kang/0000-0002-8979-813X													1027-5606	1607-7938				NOV 25	2022	26	22					5917	5931		10.5194/hess-26-5917-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5917-2022													WOS:000890897000001

Diet influences on growth and mercury concentrations of two salmonid species from lakes in the eastern Canadian Arctic	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Diet, age, and growth rate influences on fish mercury concentrations were investigated for Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in lakes of the eastern Canadian Arctic. We hypothesized that faster-growing fish have lower mercury concentrations because of growth dilution, a process whereby more efficient growth dilutes a fish's mercury burden. Using datasets of 57 brook trout and 133 Arctic char, linear regression modelling showed fish age and diet indices were the dominant explanatory variables of muscle mercury concentrations for both species. Faster-growing fish (based on length-at-age) fed at a higher trophic position, and as a result, their mercury concentrations were not lower than slower-growing fish. Muscle RNA/DNA ratios were used as a physiological indicator of short-term growth rate (days to weeks). Slower growth of Arctic char, inferred from RNA/DNA ratios, was found in winter versus summer and in polar desert versus tundra lakes, but RNA/DNA ratio was (at best) a weak predictor of fish mercury concentration. Net effects of diet and age on mercury concentration were greater than any potential offset by biomass dilution in faster-growing fish. In these resource-poor Arctic lakes, faster growth was associated with feeding at a higher trophic position, likely due to greater caloric (and mercury) intake, rather than growth efficiency.

Identifying declining groups and species will help to optimize conservation strategies. In addition, knowledge of waterbird distribution is required to identify priority areas for protection. In this study, we aimed to explore long-term population trends of waterbird groups and species and to investigate waterbird distribution in Poyang Lake by integrating survey data from 1996/1997 to 2014/2015. Poyang Lake Nature Reserve, Duchang and Nanji Wetland Nature Reserve had high waterbird richness and abundance and high proportion of IUCN endangered species, thus they are important areas for waterbird protection. An important limitation to waterbird protection in the three areas is lack of management rights of most sub-lakes. Most waterbird groups in Poyang Lake have grown, but ducks have declined. Hunting and the decline of aquatic vegetation might be driving the duck declines. In addition, White-naped Crane (Grus vipio), Spot-billed Duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) and Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) have declined. While we believe the data presented here indicate general trends in groups and species, the analyses suffered from variation in methods used in different surveys. We advocate long-term waterbird monitoring using standardized methods to better understand waterbirds' population dynamics.

J	Akitomo, K; Tanaka, K				Akitomo, Kazunori; Tanaka, Kiyoshi			A 40-year numerical experiment of circulations in Lake Biwa (2): winter overturn circulation	LIMNOLOGY												Using the results of the 40-year numerical experiment, we have investigated the processes of overturn circulation (OC) and its variability in Lake Biwa. In the severe winter of 2017-2018, OC begins as cold waters formed in the eastern shallow area descend the bottom slope to the deepest part. Even after the water column is homogenized, cold waters intermittently descend the slope causing the lateral transport and mixing of the lake water. In the mild winter of 2018-2019, vertical mixing and slope current do not reach the deepest part and OC ends incompletely. The remaining bottom waters often form a bowl-shaped structure which is accompanied by a clockwise circulation driven by the northerly winds. OC will be incomplete when the yearly difference of the winter surface water temperature (SWT) exceeds the annual increase of the bottom water temperature (BWT). The former is related to the climatic variabilities such as El Ni & ntilde;o, La Ni & ntilde;a, and the Southern Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation while the latter due mainly to the downward heat transport by wind mixing. The lake depth affects the behavior of OC by determining the intensity of the annual-cycle variability of BWT. The linear warming trend of water temperature may not have much effect on the behavior of OC in Lake Biwa today. Possible types of OC cycle are discussed, and compared with other lakes. Historical observation data have reasonably supported the model results.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2025	26	3					443	459		10.1007/s10201-025-00791-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-025-00791-y		APR 2025											WOS:001477706000001

A biopond-wetland system to control cyanobacterial bloom and stabilize or even increase biodiversity is proposed and applied in a pond, Kunming, western China where cyanobacterial blooms frequently break out. The biopond-wetland system examined includes three main parts: filter-feeding fish, replanted pond macrophytes, and a terminal artificial wetland. When the hydraulic load of the biopond-wetland system was 500 m(3)/d on non-rainy days, the system successfully decreased the level of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The declining levels of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia in the water after establishing the biopond-wetland system also coincided with the disappearance of the cyanobacterial bloom. In the second summer, when the biopond-wetland system was in a relatively steady-state condition, the overall average nutrient removal efficiencies were as follows, Chl-a (83%), TN (57%), TP (70%) and ammonia (66%), while in the second winter, the overall average removal efficiencies were Chl-a (66%), TN (40%), TP (53%) and ammonia (49%). Simpson's diversity index of zoobenthos indicated that the system increased the zoobenthic diversity and improved the growth conditions of the zoobenthos habitat. The results demonstrated that the biopond-wetland system could control cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Only two species of Monogenea were found on the gills of the host and were identified as Dactylogyrus vistulae Frost, 1967 (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae) and Paradiplozoon homoion (Bychowsky & Nagibina, 1959) (Monogenea: Diplozoidae). D. vistulae was the most common and the highest number species. Other factors such as season, host length and sex were investigated to determine their effect on the infection values of ectoparasitic helminth infection, which were calculated from information collected from 79 host fishes. However, according to our current literature, there is no study in which S. cii is considered as a valid species and investigated in terms of ichtyohelminthological in T & uuml;rkiye. This is the first ichtyohelminthological survey of S. cii in T & uuml;rkiye and therefore new host and distribution records for all helminth species. Moreover, with such studies, scientists will have the opportunity to evaluate the infection success of parasite species belonging to this group, depending on the host, environmental conditions and enemies, and their infection success depending on the seasons and host factors. And data will be obtained about the complex life histories of the species belonging to this group and will contribute to the determination of the causes of death that will occur in both cultured and natural fish populations in the future.

Exploring lake responses to plausible future climate scenarios can provide important information needed to inform stakeholders of likely effects of hydrologic changes on these waterbodies in coming decades. To assess potential climate effects on lake hydrology, we combined a previously published spatially explicit, processed-based hydrologic modeling framework implemented over the lake-rich landscape of the Northern Highlands Lake District within the United States with an ensemble of climate change scenarios for the 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100). Model results quantify the effects of climate change on water budgets and lake stage elevations for 3692 lakes and highlight the importance of landscape and hydrologic setting for the response of specific lake types to climate change. All future climate projections resulted in loss of ice cover and snowpack as well as increased evaporation, but variability in climate projections (warmer conditions, wet winters combined with wet or dry summers) interacted with lake characteristics and landscape position to produce variable lake hydrologic changes. Water levels for drainage lakes (lakes with substantial surface water inflows and outflows) showed nearly no change, whereas minimum water levels for seepage lakes (minimal surface water fluxes) decreased by an average of up to 2.64 m by the end of the 21st century. Our physically based modeling approach is parsimonious and computationally efficient and can be applied to other lake-rich regions to investigate interregional variability in lake hydrologic response to future climate scenarios.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; Bolster, Diogo/D-9667-2011	Jones, Stuart/0000-0001-5078-0250; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Bolster, Diogo/0000-0003-3960-4090													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2021	11	3					335	350		10.1080/20442041.2021.1924538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1924538		AUG 2021											WOS:000680291900001
J	Arp, CD; Whitman, MS				Arp, Christopher D.; Whitman, Matthew S.			Lake basins drive variation in catchment-scale runoff response over a decade of increasing rainfall in Arctic Alaska	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lakes basins cover wide extents of many Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) landscapes and thus are integral components of hydrological processes. Observed variation in runoff responses between two adjacent catchments being monitored pre- and post-development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) suggested the need to better understand how lake basins, both current lakes and drained lake basins (DLBs), modify flow regimes. A progressive increase in summer rainfall over this monitoring period, 2009-2019, also provided an opportunity to assess how watershed characteristics interacted with hydrologic intensification. Stream gauging records from eight other nearby catchments ranging from 16 to 270 km(2) with varying extents of lakes (14%-47%) and DLBs (5%-57%) expanded our analysis of ACP hydrology. Wider DLB extent corresponded to higher and more rapid snowmelt peak flows and this relationship also became evident during rainstorms in summers with high antecedent surface storage. Mean annual runoff and summer low-flows were best explained by extent of connected lakes. Over this period of increasing summer rainfall, all hydrograph responses became more closely related to the full extent of lake basins suggesting expanding connectivity. Our final year of complete hydrologic records in 2019 was punctuated by a 30-mm late-summer rainfall event, which generated flow peaks nearly exceeding snowmelt runoff at several gauges, specifically ones with high extent of DLBs. This rain-event response underscored the increasing need to include both lakes and DLBs in models of ACP watershed hydrology. An improved understanding of catchment-scale controls on variable hydrologic responses will be increasingly essential for mitigating hazards to new and existing development, predicting floods, drought, and water supply, and protecting aquatic ecosystem functioning and habitat as the Arctic hydrologic cycle intensifies and development expands.

J	CALDERONI, A; MOSELLO, R; QUIRCI, A				CALDERONI, A; MOSELLO, R; QUIRCI, A			CHEMICAL RESPONSE OF LAKE ORTA (NORTHERN ITALY) TO LIMING	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Lake Orta is a subalpine lake, with a maximum depth of 143 m and a volume of 1.3 10(9) m3. In 1926 the lake began to be heavily polluted by effluents rich in copper and ammonium sulphate discharged by a rayon factory. In the sixties, metals (Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn) released from plating factories became a further source of pollution. The negative effects of the metal pollution were aggravated by the acidification of the lake water caused by the oxidation of the ammonium. pH values decreased from values around 7.0 in 1948 to the minimum values of 3.8-4.0 over the whole water column which were reached in 1984. The ammonium discharge was greatly reduced in 1981, but in-lake concentrations both of ammonium and hydrogen ion remained high, because of the low alkalinity load from the watershed and the long water renewal time (8.5 years). From May 1989 to June 1990 the lake was limed with 10,900 tons of CaCO3, the first instalment of the 18,300 tons necessary to reach a target alkalinity of 50-mu-eq l-1, after the complete oxidation of the ammonium. The effect was a decrease in the mean acidity of the lake by 173-mu-eq l-1, i.e. a variation which would have taken five years with the natural load of alkalinity from the watershed. The effects were more marked in the 0-40 m water layer, where pH between 6.0 and 8.0 was measured during summer and autumn 1989. A marked decrease in Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Al concentrations was observed in the neutralized water, while values remain high in the part of lake which is still acid.

J	Yeh, PJF; Wu, CH				Yeh, Pat J. -F.; Wu, Chuanhao			Recent Acceleration of the Terrestrial Hydrologic Cycle in the US Midwest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Most hydroclimatic trend studies considered only a subset of water budget variables; hence, the trend consistency and a holistic assessment of hydrologic changes across the entire water cycle cannot be evaluated. Here we use a unique 31year (1983-2013) observed data set in Illinois (a representative region of the U.S. Midwest), including temperature (T), precipitation (P), evaporation (E), streamflow (R), soil moisture, and groundwater level (GWL), to estimate the trends and their sensitivity to different data periods and lengths. Both the Mann-Kendall trend test and the least squares linear method identify trends in close agreement. Despite no clear trends during 1983-2013, increasing trends are found in P (8.73-9.05mm/year), E (6.87-7.47mm/year), and R (1.57-3.54mm/year) during 1992-2013, concurrently with a pronounced warming trend of 0.029-0.037 degrees C/year. However, terrestrial water storageis decreased by -2.0mm/year (mainly due to declining GWL), suggesting that the increased R is caused by increased surface runoff rather than baseflow. Monthly analyses identify warming trends for all months except winter. In summer, P (E) exhibits an increasing (decreasing) trend, leading to increasing R, soil moisture, GWL, and terrestrial water storage. Most trends estimated for different subperiods are found to be sensitive to data lengths and periods. Overall, this study provides an internally consistent observed evidence on the intensification of the hydrologic cycle in response to recent climate warming in U.S. Midwest, in agreement with and well supported by several recent studies consistently reporting the increased P, R and E over the Midwest and Mississippi River basin.

J	Noges, P; Noges, T; Jastremskij, VV				Noges, P; Noges, T; Jastremskij, VV			Primary production of Lake Peipsi-Pihkva	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Primary production (PP) in Lake Peipsi-Pihkva, the tripartite border waterbody between Estonia and Russia, was first measured in 1965-1966. Since 1970 there exists a continuous timeseries of monthly PP measurements from May to October. Detailed investigations of the seasonal and daily dynamics as well as the vertical distribution of PP were carried out in 1985-1987. The long-term average values of integral PP (PPint) in Lakes Peipsi and Pihkva were equal (0.8 g C m(-2) d(-1)), although the values per cubic metre (PPmax) differed more than twofold and characterized L. Pihkva as a eutrophic lake and L. Peipsi as a transition type between meso- and eutrophic lakes. The years from 1973 to 1980, 1987 and 1991 were of low productivity, while in 1971, 1983, 1988 and 1990 PP peaks occurred in both lakes. In the seasonal pattern PPint had peaks in May and July. In June, after the spring bloom, PP as well as the chlorophyll a (Chi) and ATP content were low. The high Chi peak in autumn was probably built up by the degradation products of chlorophyll, as neither PP nor ATP increased. Seasonal changes in integral PP in L. Peipsi could be well described (R(2) = 0.91) by an empirical model relating PPint to PPmax, Secchi depth (S) and total solar radiation (Q). In mixed conditions prevailing in both lakes, PP was inhibited in the surface layer and its maximum was located at a depth of 0.25...0.5 S. The threshold total solar radiation level for the onset of inhibition was between 1200 and 2000 kT m(-2) h(-1) in May and July, and decreased to < 500 kJ m(-2) h(-1) in October. As a rule, inhibition started in the morning at a higher irradiance than necessary for keeping it up during evening hours. When compared with PPmax, photosynthesis in the surface layer at noon was suppressed by 56% in May, by 45% in July and by 40% in October.

(Chlamydomonadales, chlorophyta) algal bloom on Bagley Lake, North Cascades, WA	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Snow algal blooms frequently occur throughout alpine and polar environments during spring and summer months; however, our understanding of bloom dynamics is limited. We tracked a recurrent bloom of Chlainomonas sp. on Upper Bagley Lake in the North Cascade Mountains, USA, to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics in bloom color intensity, community photophysiology, and community composition over eight weeks. We found that the algae biomass had a dynamic patchy distribution over space and time, which was decoupled from changes in community composition and life-cycle progress averaged across the bloom. The proportional representation of Chlainomonas sp. remained consistent throughout the study while the overall community composition shows a progression through the bloom. We found that community photophysiology, measured by the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), decreased on average throughout the bloom. These findings suggest that the Chlainomonas sp. community on Bagley Lake is not simply an algal bloom with rapid increase in biomass followed by a population crash, as is often seen in aquatic systems, though there is a physiological trajectory and sensitivity to environmental stress. These results contribute to our understanding of the biology of Chlainomonas sp. and its response to environmental stress, specifically an extreme warming event. A weekly charactrization of an 8-week bloom of the snow algae, Chlainomonas sp., in a snow-on-lake progressed in asynchronous patches that showed a stress response via photophysiology measurments to an extreme heat event.

J	Butow, BJ; Wynne, D; TelOr, E				Butow, BJ; Wynne, D; TelOr, E			Antioxidative protection of Peridinium gatunense in Lake Kinneret: Seasonal and daily variation	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												A comprehensive antioxidative mechanism was found in the freshwater dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense Lemm. during the spring bloom in Lake Kinneret. Ascorbate runs present throughout the bloom period and was responsible, together with catalase, for the elimination of photosynthetically produced H2O2. As glutathione conc entrations and ascorbate regenerative enzymes were negligible during mid-spring, ascorbate was presumably biosynthesized during the photosynthetically active period. Antioxidative activity increased overall at the end of the spring in conjunction with elevated ambient stress conditions, for example high light. Under such circumstaces, ascorbate was regenerated. Ascorbate levels doubled when cells were exposed to an increase in irradiance fr om 60 to 600 mu mol photons.m(-2). s(-1), and on addition of H2O2, concentrations increased a further 20-fold. Significant antioxidative activity was also noted in the dark, although this was dependent on the presence of H2O2. Diurnal changes in antioxidants and their regenterative enzymes were observed. The activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase, and ascorbate concentrations showed ultraradian periodicity and were completely in phase throughout the day/night period. Dehydroascorbate reductase activity and glutathione concentrations were also in phase but showed aperiodic variation, as did ascorbate peroxidase activity Superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were generally out of phase during the 24-h period but did show ultraradian periodicity. Lake samples entrained under constant light revealed an inate 12-h rhythm for catalase activity, during at least 36 h.																			0022-3646					OCT	1997	33	5					780	786		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1997.00780.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1997.00780.x													WOS:A1997YE65900009

Thermal Regime of Stream Channels in Continuous Permafrost, Western Canadian Arctic	COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING 2019					18th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering and the 8th Canadian Permafrost Conference (ICCRE/CPC)	AUG 18-22, 2019	Quebec, CANADA	Canadian Geotechn Soc Eastern Quebec & Natl, Canadian Permafrost Assoc, Int Permafrost Assoc, Canadian Natl Comm, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Cold Reg Engn Div				In permafrost regions, the movement of water during winter has important implications for hydrology, land use, and infrastructure. Knowledge of winter hydrothermal dynamics in small, extensive tundra stream networks is limited. Climate warming, changing precipitation regimes, and increases in tundra vegetation coverage may delay active layer freeze-back, potentially increasing winter water movement. The primary goals of this research are to improve knowledge of the thermal regime of small stream channels in continuous permafrost, explore the implications of a changing climate and runoff, and describe the influence of infrastructure on channel thermal regime. A program of temperature monitoring in stream channel beds and riparian margins between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk is presented here. Preliminary results, if representative of several years, suggest that permafrost is not present at depths shallower than 3.5 m below the bed of a small stream with a contributing area of similar to 30 km(2), and that this layer does not likely re-freeze during winter. This thermal regime may be modified by highway crossings that reduce or eliminate stream snow cover, and the degree of thermal disturbance may be a function of contributing watershed size. This research and further related work have the potential to provide new insight on channel thermal regime and winter hydrology in permafrost regions, offer projections of change in the context of a warming climate, and help inform the design, operation, and mitigation of hydrological issues associated with linear infrastructure in permafrost.																					978-0-7844-8259-9				2019							254	262																WOS:000566191800030

This research provides insight into the heavy metals' contamination, source apportionment, and potential ecological risks in the surface sediments of the Xiang-Shan wetland in Taiwan, which is undergoing rapid economic development, mainly by the semiconductor industries. The levels of twelve metals and total organic matter (TOM) were measured in 44 samples of surface sediment during the spring and winter seasons of 2022. Subsequently, the single and comprehensive pollution indices were assessed. The findings showed that the average of HM contents exhibited a descending sequence of Al > Fe > Mn > Zn > Co > Ga > Cr > Cu > In > Ni > Pb = Cd during both seasons. The E-f, I-geo, and PI showed that the majority of sediment samples were uncontaminated to heavily contaminated by Fe, Al, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co and Ga, and extremely contaminated by In. Moreover, PLI and mC(deg) unveiled that the surface sediments of DJ, OB, and KY stations were strongly or extremely polluted. PERI revealed that the sediment shows minimal to moderate ecological risk. The findings of multivariate analyses suggested that Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, and Ni derived from natural sources, while Ga, In, Co, Cr, and Mn originated from both anthropogenic and natural origins. Hence, it is critical that HM contamination, particularly Co, In, and Ga, be continuously monitored in the study area. Our data provide significant insights for more effective prevention and evaluation of HM contamination in the aquatic-sedimentary ecosystems of Taiwan.

This study conducted a microcosm experiment using surface lake water exposed to sunlight to investigate the natural attenuation processes of MC-LR and CYN. Results indicated that photodegradation plays a crucial role in the natural attenuation of cyanotoxins. The half-lives of MC-LR and CYN were 1 and 7 days in summer under a combined effect of direct and indirect photodegradation, respectively. The effectiveness of these natural processes varied seasonally, with faster dissipation rates observed during summer. Bacterial degradation notably affected only MC-LR in summer, with a negligible effect on CYN. The identified transformation products showed that the conversion of MC-LR involved oxidation, hydroxylation, and/or bond cleavage with Adda and Mdha moieties, while it entails the oxidation of the tricyclic guanidine moiety and opening of the uracil ring for CYN. The Ames assay confirmed that these transformation products from the natural attenuation of MC-LR and CYN did not induce genotoxicity or mutagenicity. While these findings enhance our understanding of natural attenuation mechanisms, they also offer valuable insights that could guide artificial control strategies or improve the efficiency of cyanotoxin management. However, natural degradation processes alone, particularly in large water bodies, may be insufficient to fully mitigate cyanotoxin risks, highlighting the continued need for comprehensive management approaches.					; SUN, Qian/AAF-3313-2021; Kiki, Claude/AAK-7213-2020; Zhao, Feng/C-5293-2009	Li, Xi/0000-0002-3015-513X; Zhao, Feng/0000-0002-1525-042X													2833-8278					OCT 31	2024	3	2					154	163		10.1021/envhealth.4c00149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/envhealth.4c00149		OCT 2024						40012877					WOS:001427709000001

Seasonal variations in zooplankton abundances in the Iturbide reservoir (Isidro Fabela, State of Mexico, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												This study was undertaken to quantify the seasonal variations of zooplankton (rotifers, cladocerans and copepods) and selected physico-chemical variables (temperature, pH, conductivity, Secchi disc transparency, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate and phosphate concentrations) in the Iturbide dam. Monthly zooplankton samples (50 I filtered through 50 pm mesh, in duplicates from each of the 4 stations) were collected from February 2008 to January 2009. Simultaneously physico-chemical variables were measured. The zooplankton samples were fixed in 4% formalin in the field. In general, the temperature ranged from 9 to 16 degrees C, rarely exceeding 20 degrees C. Secchi transparency was nearly 100% since the reservoir was shallow (<2 m) even during the rainy seasons. Dissolved oxygen was generally high, 13-18 mg l(-1). Nitrate levels (10 to 170 mu g l(-1)) were low while phosphates were relatively high (9 to 35 mu g l(-1)). The Iturbide reservoir was dominated by rotifer species. We encountered in all, 55 taxa of rotifers, 9 cladocerans and 2 copepods. The rotifer families Trichocercidae and Notommatidae had the highest number of species (7 each) followed by Colurellidae and Lecanidae (6 and 5 species, respectively). Trichocerca elongata, Ascomorpha ovalis, K. americana, K. cochlearis, Lepadella patella and Pompholyx sulcata were the dominant rotifers during the study period. On an annual average, rotifer density ranged between 50-200 ind. l(-1). Among crustaceans Chydorus brevilabris and Macrothrix trisetialis were most abundant. The maximal density of these cladocerans was about 50 ind. l(-1). Copepods were much lower in numbers (<20 ind. l(-1)). In general the density of zooplankton was higher during summer months (April to July) than during winter. Shannon-Wiener diversity index varied from 1.0 to 4.3 depending on the site and the sampling period. Based on the data of Secchi transparency and nutrient concentrations, the Iturbide reservoir appeared to be mesotrophic.

Anthropogenic emissions of nonmethane hydrocarbons in the northeastern United States: Measured seasonal variations from 1992-1996 and 1999-2001	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Harvard Forest, a rural site located in central Massachusetts downwind of major urban-industrial centers, provides an excellent location to observe a typical regional mixture of anthropogenic trace gases. Air that arrives at Harvard Forest from the southwest is affected by emissions from the U. S. east coast urban corridor and may have residual influence from emissions in the upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region farther to the west. Because of its relatively long distance from large individual emission sources, pollution plumes reaching the site are a homogenized mixture of regional anthropogenic emissions. Concentrations of C-2-C-6 hydrocarbons along with CO and NOy were measured nearly continuously from August 1992 through July 1996 and from June 1999 through November 2001. By correlating observed concentrations to acetylene, which is almost solely produced during combustion, we are able to detect seasonal trends in relative emissions for this series of trace gases. Seasonal changes in n-butane and i-butane emissions may largely be influenced by different gasoline formulations in late spring and summer. Shifts in evaporation rates due to the annual temperature cycle could induce a seasonal pattern for n-pentane, i-pentane and n-hexane emissions. Emissions of ethane and propane lack clear seasonality relative to acetylene emissions and also correlate less with acetylene than other gases, indicating that emissions of these two gases are strongly influenced by sources not associated with fuel combustion. Changes in the observed correlations of CO2 and CO relative to acetylene are consistent with published changes in the estimated emissions of CO2 and CO over the past decade, though variability in the observations makes it difficult to precisely quantify these changes.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT												This paper assesses the chemical and bacteriological quality of drinking water in three districts of the Chittagong Hill Tract (CHT), a region within Bangladesh. Drawing water samples from tubewells, chharas/springs, lakes/canals, wells, and ponds, analysis was done on pH, alkalinity, arsenic, phosphate (PO4), sulphate (SO4), ammonium-nitrogen, conductivity, and faecal coliform bacteria. The PO4 and SO4 concentrations were within the permissible limits. In contrast, 100% of the water samples contained alkalinity below 400 mg/l. Varied proportions, ranging from 14% to 50%, of tubewells, chharas/springs, lakes/canals, and well water had a pH of less than 6.5. Three out of 16 (18.8%) tubewell water samples tested had arsenic contamination and 18% of the chhara/spring and 11% of the well water samples had an unacceptable level of conductivity. In addition, faecal coliform bacteria contaminated almost all sources of water, ranging from 81% to 100%. The water used for drinking in CHT in general is harmful for health.																			0790-0627	1360-0648				SEP	2002	18	3					439	452		10.1080/0790062022000006925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0790062022000006925													WOS:000178136200005

Fish Species Traits and Communities in Relation to a Habitat Template for Arctic Rivers and Streams	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY OF STREAM FISHES: CONCEPTS, APPROACHES, AND TECHNIQUES	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Community Ecology of Stream Fishes: Concepts, Approaches, and Techniques	AUG 19-20, 2008	Ottawa, CANADA					We develop a conceptual model of habitat factors, operating as filters at multiple spatial and temporal scales that structure local fish assemblages in flowing waters of Arctic North America. Following the habitat template approach, we classify streams into six types based on environmental gradients, including ice formation, flow and temperature regimes, sediment dynamics, and edaphic factors. We discuss likely mechanisms influencing Arctic stream fish assemblages among the six stream types and consider this habitat template in the context of regional and local filters. There is a general increase in species richness from the eastern Arctic to Alaska that is inversely proportional to the distance from the Beringian glacial refugium. The fish fauna of Arctic streams comprises nine different families, although 14 of 24 species (58%) are members of Salmonidae. Certain life history traits are predicted to be advantageous in a periglacial environment known for cold, impoverished environments with highly variable yet generally predictable ice conditions. Examples of adaptive traits displayed by Arctic fishes include fall spawning, relatively large egg size, longevity, habitat and diet generalists, and efficient metabolism. Life history theory predicts that periodic strategists should dominate in the Arctic environment. Nevertheless, in the face of a rapidly changing climate and increasing resource development, there is much need for additional research on relationships between the traits of Arctic stream fishes and their habitat.

Water samples were collected at six points in the lake, with a monthly frequency, for three winter and three summer months. Dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphates, nitrates, transparency, chlorophyll-a, fecal coliforms, biological oxygen demand (BOD), temperature, and turbidity were determined at each point. The trophic state of the lake was categorized by applying the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) eutrophication index, Carlson's trophic state index (CTSI) and trophic index (TRIX). In addition, National Sanitation Foundation water quality index (NSF-WQI), Canadian Water Quality Index (CCME-WQI) and Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) were used to evaluate water quality. Results indicated that the lake had a high level of eutrophication, suggesting an excessive accumulation of nutrients in the water. CTSI and TRIX index showed that the lake was in a hyper-eutrophic state, while according to the OECD methodology, the trophic state related to phosphorus and transparency was hypereutrophic, and according to chlorophyll, it varied from mesotrophic to eutrophic. The NSF index classified the lake with average quality, the CCME index indicated fair water quality, and the OWQI classified it as very poor. Therefore, the water quality of the high andean lake assessed by eutrophication and water quality indexes presented significant differences based on physicochemical characteristics. The human influence was identified as the main cause of eutrophication, including tourism and agriculture. These results suggest that measures should be taken to reduce human activity in the area and control pollution in the lake.					; Avilés, Alex/AAZ-6060-2020; Gonzales, Lorgio/AAW-6101-2020; García, Fernando/G-6152-2019	Valdiviezo Gonzales, Lorgio/0000-0002-8200-4640; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110924	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110924		SEP 2023											WOS:001072234600001

Characterizing groundwater-lake interactions and its impact on lake water quality	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Geochemical tracers were used to investigate groundwater-lake interactions and to map nutrient concentrations within Georgetown Lake, a 1219 ha lake situated at 1960 m above sea level between two mountain ranges in western Montana. Radon-222 was used to identify locations and relative amounts of groundwater inflow to the lake, and nutrients were sampled to investigate the role of groundwater on nutrient dynamics occurring within the lake. Sampling primarily took place during late winter and early spring when the lake was frozen, stratified and relatively anoxic, and all lake samples were collected near the bottom of the lake. Radon concentrations in the lake varied spatially from less than 3.5-194.0 pCi/L. Radon results show that groundwater enters the lake through fractured Paleozoic karst limestone situated near a major thrust fault. No groundwater flows were noted on the western side of the lake, which is underlain by west-dipping Precambrian metasedimentary rocks. The western two-thirds of the lake is anoxic near the bottom of the water column with H2S and NH4+ concentrations as high as 1.99 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L respectively. Along the eastern side of the lake, H2S was absent and NH4+ was generally low, suggesting that groundwater inflows improve water quality. Pore water diffusion samplers show that there is an internal source of NH4+, H2S, and PO43- to the lake originating from decay of organic carbon in the lake sediments. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass exhibited strong seasonal and spatial variability throughout the summers of 1995 and 1996. Nearshore areas generally contained more phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass than the offshore sampling area, but there was wide variability in pelagic phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton. Zooplankton taxonomic composition was different between sampled areas, with more calanoid copepods compared to cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods found in deep, offshore stations. Such patterns increase the difficulty in understanding the effects of zebra mussels on western Lake Erie as they suggest that additional factors, such as nutrient availability, also affect the biomass of these pelagic communities.

Integrated sedimentology and ichnology of Late Jurassic fluvial point-bars - facies architecture and colonization styles (Lourinha Formation, Lusitanian Basin, western Portugal)	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Integrated sedimentological and ichnological case studies of ancient meandering river systems have, for the most part, focused on the deposits of the fluvial-tidal transition zone; much less emphasis has been placed on the purely fluvial realm above the landward limit of tidal effects. This problem needs to be addressed so that in future the defining sedimentological and ichnological criteria assigned to ancient fluvial reaches are sufficiently well-established to enable their separation from the down-dip fluvial-tidal transition zone. Accordingly, a case study has been carried out on a well-exposed meander belt deposit from the Late Jurassic LourinhA Formation of the Lusitanian Basin, western Portugal (Praia Do ValmitAo, Ribamar). Analysis indicates that the meander belt here comprised mixed-load fluvial channels traversing a vegetated floodplain subject to a seasonal winter wet/summer dry palaeoclimate. This setting facilitated the development of both calcic palaeosols and shallow lakes on the adjacent floodplain. Critically, there is no evidence of the effects of tidal modulation on bedding structures, thereby establishing purely fluvial conditions. Heterolithic point-bar deposits generated in this setting are bioturbated extensively by a trace fossil assemblage dominated by the meniscate trace Taenidium barretti, with Skolithos linearis, Planolites beverleyensis and Cylindricum isp. also recognized. A number of factors suggest that the Taenidiumbarretti producer in this case was a subaquatic organism living in an active fluvial channel setting (i.e. not colonizing subaerially exposed channel-margin/floodplain deposits). Accordingly, there are some implications for current ichnofabric/ichnofacies models in the continental realm. Firstly, Taenidium-dominated ichnofabrics need not necessarily be confined to colonization beneath subaerially exposed surfaces; they might also be produced within submerged substrates. Secondly, there is scope to extend the range of the Scoyenia ichnofacies to include active fluvial channels and not simply those channels that were inactive or abandoned.					; Martinius, Allard/AAF-5945-2021	Martinius, Allard W./0000-0002-6414-6274; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2018	65	2					400	430		10.1111/sed.12385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12385													WOS:000419514900003

Hydrological and geomorphological basin and catchment characteristics of Lake Nam Co, South-Central Tibet	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												For Lake Nam Co, south-central Tibetan Plateau, geomorphological features and hydrological characteristics have been compiled to provide an overview of the landscape character. Information is based on primary data, collected during field campaigns in the summers of 2005 and 2006, and secondary data as available from satellite images. Nam Co is located at the intersection of the Westerlies, the winter monsoon, the South West Asian monsoon, and the East Asian monsoon. It is situated in a graben structure. Landforms of the drainage basin are highly influenced by tectonics, superimposed by fluvial and periglacial processes, and locally by glacial and aeolian processes. Its drainage basin is endorheic. Thus, lake level is primarily controlled by the balance between input through precipitation or inflow streams and evaporation as the output. The significance of lake water evaporation is evidenced by the salinity and measurable increase of H-2 and O-18 of the lake water when compared to the inflow streams and precipitation. Maximum conductivities total 431 mu S mm(-1) for the inflowing river waters and 1920 mu S mm(-1) for the lake water. Overall, the solute contents are low and characterise Nam Co as a pristine environment. Dominant ions are calcium and bicarbonate in river waters. Sulphate contents are relatively high in Nam Co, and the lake is also characterised by high boron values. A significant decrease in lake water salinity during the past two decades is likely related to increased freshwater input. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Barkan, E; Luz, B; Lazar, B				Barkan, E; Luz, B; Lazar, B			Dynamics of the carbon dioxide system in the Dead Sea	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Because the Dead Sea is a Ca-chloride hypersaline lake and is virtually lifeless, it is an excellent system to investigate the physical and chemical paths of the carbon cycle in terrestrial aquatic environments that are generally overwhelmed by biologic carbon fluxes. The Dead Sea is known to form massive aragonite deposits in the form of varves at present and during the Lisan period (late Pleistocene). The commonly accepted season for the main aragonite precipitation was summer, and the trigger for precipitation was attributed to evaporation and the warming of surface water ("whitening" events). To determine the main carbon fluxes in the Dead Sea, we followed changes in the carbonate system of the mixed layer, from February 1993 to December 1994, after stratification formed due to heavy flooding during the winter of 1992. The stratification isolated the mixed layer, a relatively small reservoir from the main brine body, causing an amplification of the chemical signals. The data show that partial pressure of CO2 in the lake was very high (approximate to 2000 mu atm). Total alkalinity and total carbon of the mixed layer decreased with time, whereas delta C-13 increased. The high P-CO2 originates from precipitation of aragonite and implies that in many aquatic systems it may originate from an inorganic process and not only from degradation of organic matter. Thermodynamic calculation estimated the degree of aragonite saturation to be approximate to 15 when 10% of Dead Sea brine with a high Ca content mixed with 90% runoff freshwater with high-bicarbonate content. Therefore, mixing during winter flooding triggers massive aragonite deposition in the Dead Sea. The general conclusion is that inorganic carbonate precipitation by mixing of two solutions, one supplying Ca2+ and the other HCO3- should be considered in the evaluation of the carbonate system in a wide range of aquatic environments. A mass-balance model for total alkalinity, total carbon, and carbon isotopes reveals two main carbon sinks and one carbon source. The sinks are a chemical deposition of aragonite (1.4 mol.m(-2).y(-1)) andCO(2) escape to the atmosphere (4 mol.m(-2).y(-1)), and the source is bicarbonate input by floods (2.1 mol.m(-2). y(-1)). The precipitation rate of the present Dead Sea is approximately sixfold lower than the average precipitation rate during the Lisan period, implying a wetter climate during that period. The present CO2 escape rate from the mixed layer is twice the bicarbonate input and threefold the aragonite precipitation rate, indicating a net CO2 loss. We suggest that such a scenario is possible if the Dead Sea was meromictic (stratified) for a very long period of time. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Nowadays, efforts are made from the Hellenic Republic to modernize the existing facilities and infrastructure networks of the area. To study the complex ecosystem of the thermal spring, we collected water from four sampling points (Lake, and Caves 1, 2, and 3). Filtration method was used for microbial enumeration. In parallel, total bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 166 different bacterial families were detected. Differences in families, genera, and species abundances were detected between the different sampling points. Specifically, Comamonadaceae was the most common family detected in Lake and Cave 3. Similarly, in Caves 1 and 2, Rhodobacteraceae was detected at a higher percentage compared to the rest of the families. Moreover, the detection of sequences assigned to waterborne or opportunistic pathogens, i.e., Enterobacteriaceae, Legionellaceae, Coxiellaceae, and Clostridiaceae, as well as Enterococcus and Vibrio, is of great importance. Although the presence of pathogens was not examined by quantitative PCR, the detection of their sequences strengthens the need of the planned rehabilitation actions of this natural environment in order to allow human swimming.

Coastal beaches, which serve as nursery habitats for native and introduced species, are, however, relatively poorly studied. Our objective was to assess fish assemblages of beach habitats in western Lake Huron and compare species composition pre- (1993) and post-invasion (2012) of dreissenid mussels and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Nearshore beach fish assemblages were sampled by nighttime beach seining during spring and summer in 1993 and 2012 in the western basin of Lake Huron along the Michigan shoreline. Catch rates were considerably higher, but there were fewer species present in 2012 than in 1993. The composition of species changed dramatically from a cold- and cool-water species assemblage in 1993 (dominated by alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), as well as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)) to a cool- and warm-water species assemblage in 2012 (dominated by cyprinids, round goby (Nogobius melanstomus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)). The observed rise in catch rate and shift in species composition appears related to the introduction of invasive species as well as an on-going warming pattern in nearshore waters.

J	Smith, M; Compton, JS				Smith, M; Compton, JS			Origin and evolution of major salts in the Darling pans, Western Cape, South Africa	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Sediment and water samples from 12 saline pans on the semi-arid west coast of South Africa were analysed to determine the origin of salts and geochemical evolution of water in the pans. Parts in the area can be subdivided into large, gypsiferous coastal pans with 79-150 g/kg total dissolved salt (TDS), small inland brackish to saline (2-64 g/kg TDS) pans and small inland brine (168-531 g/kg TDS) pans that have a layer of black sulphidic mud below a halite crust. The salinity of coastal pan waters varies with the seasonal influx of dilute runoff and dissolution of relict Pleis-tocene marine evaporite deposits. In contrast, inland pans are local topographic depressions, bordered on the north by downslope lunette dunes, where solutes are concentrated by evaporation of runoff, throughflow and groundwater seepage. The composition of runoff and seepage inflow waters is determined by modification of coastal rainfall by weathering, calcite precipitation and ion exchange reactions in the predominantly granitic catchment soils. Evaporation of pan waters leads to precipitation of calcite, Mg-calcite, dolomite, gypsum and halite in a distinct stratigraphic succession in pan sediments. Bicarbonate limits carbonate precipitation, Ca limits gypsum precipitation and Na limits halite precipitation. Dolomitisation of calcite is enhanced by the high Mg/Ca ratio of brine pan waters. Brine pan waters evolve seasonally from Na-Cl dominated brines in the wet winter months to Mg-Cl dominated brines in the dry summer months, when 5-20 cm thick halite crusts cover pan surfaces. Pan formation was probably initiated during a drier climate period in the early Holocene. More recent replacement of natural vegetation by cultivated land may have accelerated salt accumulation in the pans. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Over the entire area, copepods overwhelmingly dominated the zooplankton community both in terms of abundance (mean: 87.9%) and biomass (83.4%). The remaining taxa were cladocerans (i.e. Diphanosoma brachyurum, Evadone tergestina, Penilia avirostris, Podon leuckarti and Podon palyphemoides), appendicularians (Oikopleura dioica and Oikopleura longicauda), chaetognaths (Sagitta crassa) and the larvae of benthos (e.g. polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods and malacostracans), The geographical and seasonal variations of the mesozooplankton community were therefore principally explained by the variations of the copepod community. The geographical difference in copepod species composition was associated with salinity preference or tolerance of respective species. In Lake Shinji, where the salinity was lowest (mean: 4.0), Sinocalanus tenellus was monospecifically abundant with sporadic occurrence of Pseudodiaptomus inopinus. In Ohashi River (mean salinity: 9.9), Acartia hudsonica, Acartia sinjiensis, Eurytemora pacifica and Oithona davisae added to the community. At central and southeast Lake Nakaumi and in Honjo District, where mean salinity ranged from 16.4 to 21.7, these four species became more important than S. tenellus and P. inopinus. At the entrance of Sakai Strait, where the salinity was highest (mean: 24.0), Paracalanus spp. constituted a significant component. Due to large temperature fluctuation with season, the copepods showed remarkable seasonal variations in abundance and biomass, with enormous annual peaks in winter-spring. These annual peaks might be attributed to scarce occurrence of predators. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Canadian cryospheric response to an anomalous warm summer: A synthesis of the climate change action fund project "The state of the arctic cryosphere during the extreme warm summer of 1998"	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												As of 2003, the warmest year on record in Canada (and globally) was 1998. Extensive warming was observed over the Canadian Arctic during the summer of 1998. A collaborative, interdisciplinary project involving government, universities, and the private sector examined the effect of this unusual warmth on cryospheric conditions and documented the responses, placing them in a 30-40 year context. This paper represents a synthesis if these results. 1998 was characterized by a melt season of exceptional length, having both an unusually early start and late finish. Extremes were noted for cryospheric variables that included ground thaw penetration, snow-free season, lake-ice-free season, glacier melt, and the duration and extent of marine open water. The warm conditions contributed to the break-up of two long-term, multi-year ice plugs in the north-west Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which allowed floe ice into the Northwest Passage. Synoptic events and preconditioning were observed to play an important role in governing the response of some variables to the warming. It was also noted that response was not uniform in all regions. This study provided an opportunity to examine possible cryospheric response to future, warmer conditions. It also provided a chance to assess the capability of current cryospheric monitoring networks in the Canadian Arctic. This study has suggested the manner of cryospheric response to low frequency, high magnitude events occurring within the broader milieu of large-scale forcing.					; Lewkowicz, Antoni/B-4077-2013; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Wolfe, Stephen/0000-0001-7255-1184; 													0705-5900	1480-9214				DEC	2006	44	4					347	375		10.3137/ao.440403	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.440403													WOS:000243366500003
J	Shanyavskaya, AA				Shanyavskaya, Aleksandra A.			"These Bright Eyes Were Free from Vagueness": Peculiar Graphic Art of the Leningrad Artist Vera Milyutina	HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST												The article studies the prewar artistic legacy of the Leningrad artist Vera Milyutina (1903-1987). Her most famous work is a graphic series The Hermitage in the Days of the Siege of Leningrad (1942). Art historians have ignored Vera Milyutina's prewar works, where from springs the relevance of this article. It attempts to analyze Milyutina's works stored in the Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St. Petersburg. The author sets off to study the documents on Milyutina's summer trips in 1937-1939, their objects and routes and to analyze the works of art created in these trips and demonstrate their importance for formation of Vera Milyutina's graphic art. The article draws on unpublished documents, works of art, and photos from the Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St. Petersburg. During her summer trips Vera Milyutina visited different parts of the Soviet Union: Karelia, the Altai, the Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod) region. Pencil, ink, and watercolour paintings give an account of Vera Milyutina's trip to Karelia in 1937. There is an album, which had by some miracle survived the Siege of Leningrad; it is an unique document on her 1938 trip to Altai. It contains drawings, notes, hortus siccus, photos, and documents from the trip. A detailed account of the trip to the Gorky region in 1939 was left in the artist's diary covering 1939 to 1953 and in her memoirs prepared in 1985. There are numerous drawings of Lake Svetloyar and town Semenov (both in the Gorky region). Art review of materials from the Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St. Petersburg concludes that Vera Milyutina was exacting in her work, followed the principles of academic drawing according to the system of Pavel Chistyakov (Russian artist from St. Petersburg, 1832-1919), and chose timeless subjects for her work. The article can be of use to art historians and archivists, who study the evolution of the Soviet graphic art and biographies of the Leningrad artists.																			2073-0101						2019		2					610	622		10.28995/2073-0101-2019-2-610-622	http://dx.doi.org/10.28995/2073-0101-2019-2-610-622													WOS:000473803800024

Our continuous tree-ring delta O-18 record reveals a significant long-term drying trend over much of the Holocene (P < 0.001), which is in line with orbital forcing and independent evidence from proxy reconstructions and model simulations. Wetter conditions in the early-to-mid Holocene coincide with the African Humid Period, whereas the most severe summer droughts of the past 9000 years are found during the Little Ice Age in the 18th and 19th centuries Common Era. We suggest that much of Europe was not only warmer but also wetter during most of the preindustrial Holocene, which implies a close relationship between insolation changes and long-term hydroclimate trends that likely affected natural and societal systems across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales.

Burrow flow (BF) is part of the transport hydrology algorithm used in IROWCs since it is a key pathway for sub-surface contaminant transport. The objectives of this study were to develop a methodology for predicting the likelihood of BF occurrence in agricultural soils across Canada at the landscape scale, and to determine its variation over a 25-year period (1981-2006). The BF algorithm considers the influence of climate, soil properties, and soil management on the likely frequency of BF and distribution of burrows (B) made by Lumbricus terrestris L. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Quebec, followed by New Brunswick, had the highest likelihood of BF due to favourable humidity, sufficient heat, medium-textured soils, and strong runoff during the growing season and spring thaw. Alberta and Saskatchewan are too dry to favour BF. Areas with high risk of BF fall within locations of high potential for lateral flow due to shallow soils, or to the presence of tile drainage, which may connect BF pathways to important water bodies such as the Great Lakes and the St-Lawrence River. Sensitivity analyses on threshold values used in the BF algorithm indicated that Manitoba is the most sensitive province to changes in precipitation, Quebec to temperature, Prince Edward Island to soil depth, and Ontario to manure application. The BF algorithm can be used as a simple tool to predict the likelihood of water and contaminant transport along earthworm burrows with data available across Canada. It will be upgraded with new data (e.g. climate change) and with an improved algorithm after statistical analyses and correlations with actual water quality data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports on a multi-proxy analysis consisting of magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon content (TOC), pollen, grain size, and geochemical parameters from the peat deposit in the Gonghe Basin to reconstruct the Holocene millennial-scale climatic variation. The results indicate that the climate tended to be warm and humid since 10.0 cal ka BP, but it deteriorated obviously (cold and dry) in 8.6-7.1 cal ka BP. The regional optimal warm and humid period was from 7.1-3.8 cal ka BP, although there were frequent climatic fluctuations during that time. Thereafter, the climate became cold and dry. 10 millennial-time-scale cold events were recorded, which were coincident with climatic records from deep sediments in the North Atlantic Ocean, ice cores, lakes, peat, and aeolian deposits in the QTP. In addition, we discovered that the southwestern monsoons forced by solar insolation in the Holocene have crucial effects on regional climatic change, and the millennial-scale cold fluctuations are possibly related to the thermohaline circulation (THC).

In addition, ticks infesting roe deer were screened to assess their role as a vector and reservoir of Bartonella. Blood and tissue samples of 72 animals from north-western Poland were PCR-screened. Bartonella DNA was detected by using primers complementary to the intergenic spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes, which is used for identification of over a dozen species of this genus. Products of three different sizes were detected: 230 and 290 bp, representative of two strains of Bartonella capreoli, and 190 bp, identified as Bartonella bovis. All the three amplicons were detected in the blood, spleen and liver from the roe deer. All samples from the heart, lungs and kidneys were PCR negative. In ticks (Ixodes ricinus), only the 290 bp fragment from B. capreoli was present. Generally, Bartonella infection rate in Capreolus capreolus amounted to 27.6% of the roe deer, but it was much higher during winter (62%) than in spring (6.9%). The results show that the roe deer may be a reservoir for B. capreoli and B. bovis. The infection detected in L ricinus ticks (7.7%) suggests that ticks may act as a Bartonella reservoir and vector.

Effects of Mechanical Harvest plus Chipping and Prescribed Fire on Sierran Runoff Water Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												HIT suppression in Sierran ecosystems creates a Substantial wildfire hazrard and may exacerhate nutrient inputs into Lake Tahoe by allowing the buildup of O horizon material, which serves as a source for high N an P concentrations in runoff water The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of biomass reduction using cut-to-length mechanical harvest followed by chipping and controlled burning on surface runoff volume and Water quality. Based on previous findings regarding N and P leaching flux and soil solution concentrations, we hypothesized that controlled burning and/or mechanical bar vest with residue chipping does not increase inorganic N, P, and S concentrations in overland flow. Runoff, snowmelt, and rainfall were collected, volume measurements were taken, and samples were analyzed for NO4-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, and SO4. Runoff volume, season, and year were identified as important parameters influencing overland flow nutrient concentrations and loads. Higher nutrient concentrations were commonly associated with summer rather than winter runoff, but the opposite was true, for nutrient loads due to the higher runoff volumes. Treatment (unharvested, harvested, unburned, burned) effect was a strong predictor for discharge loads of NO3-N and SO4 but was a weak predictor for PO4-P, Discharge loads of NO3-N and SO, were greater for the unburned harvested and the burned unharvested treatments than for the unburned, unharvested control sites or the burned and harvested combined treatment. Although mechanical harvest and/or controlled burning had a small initial impact on increased nutrient loading, the effects were minimal compared with background levels. Hence, these, management practices may have the potential to improve forest health without the danger of large-magnitude nutrient mobilization and degradation of runoff water quality found with wildfire.

We assessed the similarity of the temperature signal based on chironomids, isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (isoGDGTs), and pollen within a comparison with locally modeled temperature data generated by the CHELSA_Trace21k dataset. Pollen, macroscopic charcoal remains, and geochemistry were further used to reconstruct past environmental conditions such as vegetation dynamics, fire activity, the input of lithogenic material (Titanium), nutrient content (Total Nitrogen) and the sources of organic matter (C/N and delta 13Corg). All temperature reconstructions based on independent proxies were positively correlated and followed the same long-term trend. However, results also showed that chironomids-inferred July temperature had lower amplitude variations compared to the other temperature curves. IsoGDGTs showed the most pronounced decrease in temperature values at the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD), corroborating that this cooling event was more marked during winter than summer. However, a decrease of less than 1 degrees C during summer and two shortterm warm events at 12.6 and 12.2 cal ka BP provoked a modest and asynchronous response of the vegetation to the onset of the YD. Nevertheless, isoGDGTs appeared to react to changes in both temperature and organic carbon sources, particularly between 11.2 and 10.6 cal yr BP. These environmental changes, characterized by high values of the GDGT-0/crenarchaeol ratio, recorded an increase in methanogenic activity in the lake sediments, which likely altered the recorded climatic signal. The corresponding anoxic episodes in the lake sediments might be caused by an increasing input of organic carbon from the catchment, related to the development of the vegetation and catchment soils at the beginning of the Holocene. Finally, pollen-based temperature reconstruction showed a lag in the response to major climatic events, such as the onset of YD and Holocene. Our study increases the understanding of the climate-vegetation-environmental feedback during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene in the Bohemian Forest, Central Europe.					; Chiverrell, Richard/A-9115-2011; Carter, Vachel/P-6884-2019; Tatosova, Jolana/AAH-5528-2020; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Kuneš, Petr/C-7099-2008; Kunes, Petr/C-7099-2008; Florescu, Gabriela/M-4031-2017	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Mateo Beneito, Amanda/0009-0008-7542-1009; Kunes, Petr/0000-0001-9605-8204; Florescu, Gabriela/0000-0002-7605-9557													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 1	2024	331								108647	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108647		APR 2024											WOS:001231145000001

Year-round measures of planktonic metabolism reveal net autotrophy in surface waters of a Great Lakes estuary	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												During 2009 and 2010, we quantified monthly changes in plankton metabolism and environmental variables in the surface waters of Muskegon Lake, a Great Lakes estuary connected to Lake Michigan. Muskegon Lake's mean (+/- SE) annual gross plankton primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) rates were 46 +/- 9 and 23 +/- 4 mg C l(-1) yr(-1), respectively. GPP: R ratios of 0.6 to + 4.8 with a yearly mean of 2.0 +/- 0.3 indicated that the surface water of Muskegon Lake was net autotrophic during all but the winter months under ice cover, when it was in a near carbon balance to slightly heterotrophic state. Approximately 5% of GPP and 12% of R occurred during the winter months, highlighting winter's potential role in nutrient regeneration. An overall positive annual net community production (NCP) rate of 28 +/- 6 mg C l(-1) yr(-1) makes Muskegon Lake's surface waters a net sink for carbon on an annual basis. Annual heterotrophic bacterial production (BP) rates were 5 +/- 3 mg C l(-1) yr(-1), suggesting a substantial fraction of GPP was likely processed through the microbial food web (2 to 76%). A stepwise multiple linear regression model revealed the plausible drivers of GPP (temperature [T], photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], total phosphorus [TP], dissolved oxygen [DO], chlorophyll a [chl a]), NCP (T, PAR, TP), R (T, DO, ammonium [NH3], soluble reactive phosphorous [SRP], dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) and GPP: R (T, PAR, SRP, DOC). Year-round measurements inform us of the strong seasonality in the carbon cycle of temperate lakes.

Endemics or narrow-ranged taxa, sensitive to alteration of physical and chemical conditions, may serve as local bioindicators. Homoeogammarus scutarensis is an endemic, cold-adapted amphipod crustacean, inhabiting fragmented spring habitats, within a relatively small area of the Lake Skadar basin. The basin is recently under heavy anthropogenic influence leading to habitat deterioration. Genetic diversity within H. scutarensis was investigated using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA markers. Genetic diversity within the mitochondrial (mt)DNA appeared to be surprisingly high as for the limited spatial scale. The history of within-species divergence dates back at least to the Pliocene. A case of interspecific mtDNA introgression from the endemic H. scutarensis to the widespread and partly sympatric Homoeogammarus thoni was observed in one of the studied populations. Demographic analysis showed that the demography of H. scutarensis population has been stable, without evidence of expansion. Thus, we believe that H. scutarensis, responsive to environmental changes, is a proper model mirroring the conditions in sensitive habitats of the Lake Skadar basin. To protect ongoing evolutionary processes, the conservation measures for this species should take into account the complex fine-scale lineage endemism patterns. This case study may also provide a hint for planning conservation strategies in other geologically old spring systems. Most of the localities where H. scutarensis occurs provide refugia for divergent mtDNA lineages, suggesting prolonged isolation between sites and independent evolutionary histories. We conclude that H. scutarensis is composed of two or three conservation units. One of them occupies the headwaters of the Crnojevica River and spring in its valley. The other is widespread throughout the sub-lacustrine springs and the Zeta Plain; however, a group of unique haplotypes is found in springs in the Podhum Bay. Their presence and distribution should be considered while planning any investments or conservation strategies.

Short- and Long-Term Evaluation of Passive Integrated Transponder and Visible Implant Elastomer Tag Performance in Muskellunge	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fisheries professionals charged with managing muskellunge Esox masquinongy frequently seek population information that requires the ability to identify cohorts as well as individuals; hence, reliable tagging methods are needed. Our approach was to simultaneously assess multiple marking techniques on different life stages of muskellunge over short and long time scales. We evaluated the short-term detection of visible implant elastomer (VIE) and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags in muskellunge fingerlings in experimental ponds. We compared survival (relative to that of control fish) and tag retention for two PIT tagging locations (the cheek and dorsal musculature) and one VIE location (the jaw). Overwinter survival did not differ between tagged and untagged fish (84-98%), but overwinter PIT tag retention was lower for the cheek (92%) than the dorsal musculature (100%). We also fin-clipped and VIE-tagged (jaw) 1,651 muskellunge fingerlings from 1997 to 2002 to evaluate long-term tag retention in a broodstock lake. In addition, 125 adult muskellunge were captured and PIT-tagged from 2003 to 2006. Muskellunge were sampled annually with trap nets and electrofishing during spring and fall. Only 2 VIE tags were detected in adults marked as fingerlings. The proportion of PIT-tagged adults recaptured ranged from 52% to 84% during the sampling period. Our results indicate that both VIE and PIT tags are viable short-term marks for muskellunge fingerlings, while PIT tags appear to be reliable long-term tags when implanted in the dorsal musculature of adults.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2010	30	1					281	288		10.1577/M08-257.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-257.1													WOS:000277113900024

Here, detailed environmental magnetic investigations and mineralogical analyses were conducted on lacustrine sediments of Core GH09B1 (2.8 m long) from Gonghai Lake, Shanxi, North China, concerning the monsoon history during the MWP. The results demonstrate that the main magnetic mineral is magnetite. The sediments with relatively high magnetic mineral concentrations were characterized by relatively fine magnetic grain sizes, which were formed in a period of relatively strong pedogenesis and high precipitation. In contrast, the sediments with low magnetic mineral concentrations reflected an opposite process. The variations of magnetic parameters in Gonghai Lake sediments were mainly controlled by the degree of pedogenesis in the lake drainage basin, which further indicated the strength of the Asian summer monsoon. The variations in the chi and S (-300) parameters of the core clearly reveal the Asian summer monsoon history over the last 1200 years in the study area, suggesting generally abundant precipitation and a strong summer monsoon during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, AD 910-1220), which is supported by pollen evidence. Furthermore, this 3-6-year resolution environmental magnetic record indicates a dry event around AD 980-1050, interrupting the generally humid MWP. The summer monsoon evolution over the last millennium recorded by magnetic parameters in sediments from Gonghai Lake correlates well with historical documentation (North China) and speleothem oxygen isotopes (Wanxiang Cave), as well as precipitation modeling results (extratropical East Asia), which all indicate a generally humid MWP within which centennial-scale moisture variability existed. It is thus demonstrated that environmental magnetic parameters could be used as an effective proxy for monsoon climate variations in high-resolution lacustrine sediments.

J	Huang, W; Zhou, LZ; Zhao, NN				Huang, Wei; Zhou, Lizhi; Zhao, Niannian			Temporal-spatial patterns of intestinal parasites of the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) wintering in lakes of the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: Parasites have adverse effects on the life and survival of many migratory waterbirds, especially birds on the endangered species list. Hooded Cranes are large migratory colonial waterbirds wintering in wetlands, which are prone to parasite infection, thus monitoring the diversity of parasites is important for sound wetland management and protection of this species. Methods: From November 2012 to April 2013, we collected 821 fresh faecal samples from the three lakes (Poyang, Caizi and Shengjin Lake) in the lower and middle Yangtze River floodplain, and detected with saturated brine floating and centrifugal sedimentation methods. Parasite eggs were quantified with a modified McMaster's counting method. Results: In this study, 11 species of parasites were discovered, i.e., two coccidium (Eimeria gruis, E. reichenowi), five nematodes (Capillaria sp., Strongyloides sp., Ascaridia sp., Trichostrongylus sp., Ancylostomatidae), three trematodes (Echinostoma sp., Echinochasmus sp., Fasciolopsis sp.) and one cestode (Hymenolepis sp.). About 57.7% of the faecal samples showed parasitic infection. All species of parasites were found at the three sites except Hymenolepis which was not found at Poyang Lake. While most samples were affected by only one or two species of parasites, infection by Eimeria spp. was the most common (53.1%). From One-Way ANOVA analysis of the three lakes, parasite species richness index (p = 0.656), diversity index (p = 0.598) and evenness index (p = 0.612) showed no significant difference. According to the statistical analysis of our data, there were no significant difference in parasite species richness index (p = 0.678) and evenness index (p = 0.238) between wintering periods, but a strong difference in diversity index (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in the wintering Hooded Crane populations, parasite diversity is more sensitive to changes in the overwintering periods than to locations. This also indicates that with the limitations of migration distance, the parasites may not form the differentiation in Hooded Crane populations of the three lakes.

It is an important overwintering area for waterfowl species. It is a RAMSAR wetland, a National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage, and a Biosphere Reserve. This review paper provides a broad overview of the climatic, hydraulic, biogeochemical features, bio-resources, and bio-productivity of the Lake. The interconnectivity between the different environmental components of the lake is presented, highlighting the main characteristics of this vital ecosystem. Its ecosystem consists of a permanent lake bordered by temporary marshes. It is connected to the Mediterranean Sea via Bizerte Lagoon under a typical semi-arid to sub-humid bio-climate with wet and dry seasons. The winter rainfall fills up the rivers and lake with freshwater that overflows into the Tinja River. In summer, high evaporation reduces the water level and allows seawater to enter the wetland from Bizerte Lagoon. The ecosystem is threatened by pollution, the damming of its main rivers, and climate change. The unsustainable water management has resulted in fundamental environ-mental modifications, as evidenced by the large variation in the salinity, water level, productivity of water plants, and the decline in venue and stop-overs of waterbirds. The current situation is a warning that indicates a general perturbation of the resources of this particular site and of Tunisian wetlands in general, especially that the Mediterranean region has been designated as a climate change hotspot. Accurate hydrological management is needed to boost the physical functioning of the ecosystem, and to gain deeper knowledge of the different phases of the water cycle and its relationship to other long-term environmental cycles for sustainable water management strategies in the most water-scarce region in the world.					; Basti, Leila/AAP-2721-2020; Benabdallah, Sihem/AAG-7062-2020; Béjaoui, Béchir/AGR-1419-2022; Kassouk, Zeineb/JVN-6434-2024	SAHBANI, Sabrine/0000-0002-5444-5844; Blake, Reginald/0000-0001-9974-0663; 													1385-1101	1873-1414				DEC	2022	190								102288	10.1016/j.seares.2022.102288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2022.102288		OCT 2022											WOS:000879074600003

Past temperature and moisture parameters were estimated using modem analogues and 'plant functional types' transfer-function methods for three pollen records obtained from different localities within the paleolake basin. The comparison of these methods shows that they provide generally similar climate signals, with the exception of the Bolling. Comparison of pollen- and chironomid-based temperature of the warmest month reconstructions generally agree, except during the Bolling. Major abrupt changes associated with the Oldest Dryas/Bolling, Allerod/Younger Dryas, and the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transitions were quantified as well as other minor fluctuations related to the cold events (e.g., Preboreal oscillation). The temperature of the warmest month increased by similar to 5 degrees C at the start of Bolling, and by 1.5 degrees-3 degrees C at the onset of the Holocene, while it fell by ca. 3 degrees to 4 degrees C at the beginning of Younger Dryas. The comparative analysis of the results based on the three Lautrey cores have highlighted significant differences in the climate reconstructions related to the location of each core, underlining the caution that is needed when studying single cores not taken from the deepest part of lake basins.

J	Godhantaraman, N; Uye, S				Godhantaraman, N; Uye, S			Geographical and seasonal variations in taxonomic composition, abundance and biomass of microzooplankton across a brackish-water lagoonal system of Japan	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The taxonomic composition, abundance and biomass of microzooplankton were studied at eight stations in Lake Shinji-Ohashi River-Lake Nakaumi brackish-water system, Japan, monthly from April 1998 to March 1999. Over the entire area, naked ciliates numerically dominated the microzooplankton community (annual mean 39.6%) followed, in order, by tintinnids (30.3%), copepod nauplii (24.6%) and rotifers (5.5%). The abundance of each taxonomic group of microzooplankton varied geographically due to large salinity variations (range 1.5-33.3 p.s.u.). It was notable that naked ciliates occurred overwhelmingly in Lake Shinji (54.9% of total microzooplankton) and rotifers were relatively numerous in Lake Shinji (8.8%) and Ohashi River (11.1%), where the salinity was lower (annual mean 4.1 and 13.6 p.s.u., respectively) than in Lake Nakaumi and Sakai Strait (26.3 and 29.8 p.s.u., respectively). Owing to large seasonal temperature variation (range 5.4-29.8degreesC), the abundance of microzooplankton showed marked seasonal variations, being higher in spring and summer than in the remaining seasons. A total of 49 species of tintinnids were identified, and 15 of these species reached concentrations >500 individuals l(-1). The occurrence of most tintinnid species was confined to certain months or locations, closely associated with species-specific temperature and salinity preference and/or tolerance. In this eutrophic system food supply for microzooplankton might be sufficient due to extremes high chlorophyll a concentration (annual mean 8.8 mug l(-1) in Sakai Strait to 22.6 mug l(-1) in Lake Shinji). However, microzooplankton biomass remained moderate (range 0.19-18.7 mug C l(-1)) due probably to heavy predation by mesozooplankton, which inhabit this brackish-water system at extremely high biomass.																			0142-7873					MAY	2003	25	5					465	482		10.1093/plankt/25.5.465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/25.5.465													WOS:000183033900001
J	Bonacci, O; Roje-Bonacci, T				Bonacci, O; Roje-Bonacci, T			Interpretation of groundwater level monitoring results in karst aquifers: examples from the Dinaric karst	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The paper presents an attempt to determine the characteristics of karst aquifers using information on groundwater lever (GWL) in natural holes and boreholes with different data quantity and time resolution of GWL measurements. In this paper the particulars of karst aquifers were analysed for four examples from the Dinaric karst. In all four study areas, aquifers are formed in bare, deep and well-developed Dinaric karst consisting of Cretaceous limestones. The first example represents a wide area of Imotsko polje in the karst. The aquifer was analysed on the basis of infrequent water level monitoring in natural karst water features (jamas, lakes, wells) and discharges of springs and rivers. The karst aquifer in this example is complex, non-homogenous and variable in space and time, which is frequent in the Dinaric karst. Regardless of the aforementioned it was possible to determine its elementary characteristics. The second example represents 10 wells used for the water supply for the city of Pula. The GWL and salinity were measured once a week in the period between 1981 and 1996. Even though these measurements were relatively infrequent in space and time, they served as bases for assessment of average and maximum aquifer conditions as well as boundaries of saltwater intrusion. In the third example only a portion of aquifer of the karst spring Blaz, which is in the contact with the Adriatic Seas, has been analyzed. It is a spring with an intrusion of salt water. For purposes of study of saltwater intrusion, 26 piezometers were drilled in its vicinity in which GWL, salinity and temperature were measured once a day during 168 days, a period comprising one complete cycle of seawater intrusion and retreat. These measurements proved the existence of dispersed discharge from the aquifer into the sea and its non-homogeneity in space. In the fourth example GWL was measured continuously in 10 deep (up to 300 m) piezometers in the hinterland of the Ombla Spring catchment. The measurement period lasted 2 years (January 1988 to December 1989). The analyses are made with hourly data. The results made it possible to determine numerous characteristics of the karst aquifer and a significant non-homogeneity of groundwater distribution in karst aquifers, depending more on the underground karst phenomena than the surface karst forms.

E.; Forkner, Rebecca		iNaturalist Citizen Scientists	Citizen science data reveal regional heterogeneity in phenological response to climate in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Regional populations of geographically widespread species may respond to different environmental factors across the species' range, generating divergent effects of climate change on life-history phenology. Using thousands of citizen science observations extracted from iNaturalist and associated with corresponding temperature, precipitation, elevation, and daylength information, we examined the drivers of adult mating and of nymphal phenology, development, and group size for populations of the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, in different ecoregions. Research-grade iNaturalist images were correctly identified 98.3% of the time and yielded more than 3000 observations of nymphal groups and 1000 observations of mating adults spanning 18 years. Mating phenology showed distinct regional patterns, ranging from year-round mating in California to temporally restricted mating in the Great Lakes Northeastern Coast ecoregion. Relative temperature increases of 1 degrees C for a given daylength expanded the mating season by more than a week in western ecoregions. While increases in relative temperature delayed mating phenology in all ecoregions, greater winter precipitation advanced mating in the California ecoregion. In the east- ern ecoregions, nymphal phenology was delayed by increases in summer rainfall but was advanced by relative temperature increases, whereas in western regions, relative temperature increases delayed nymphal phenology. Furthermore, accumulated grow- ing degree days (AGDD) was a poor predictor of developmental progression, as we found a positive but weak correlation between AGDD and age structure only for the Appalachian Southeast North America and the Great Lakes Northern Coast ecore- gions. These complex phenological responses of O. fasciatus are just one example of how populations may be differentially susceptible to a diversity of climatic effects; using data across a species' whole distribution is critical for exposing regional varia- tions, especially for species with large, continental-scale ranges. This study demon- strates the potential of photodocumented biodiversity data to aid in the monitoring of life history, host plant- insect interactions, and climate responsiveness.

J	HARTIG, JH; WALLEN, DG				HARTIG, JH; WALLEN, DG			SEASONAL-VARIATION OF NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Monthly nurient enrichment experiments were performed from April-Oct., 1983, to identify growth limiting nutrients of natural phytoplankton assemblages collected from a station in the Pigeon Bay waters off the north shore of Lake Erie''s western basin. Data from these experiments suggest that Si was the major limiting nutrient in April, P was the major limiting nutrient in May-Sept., and trace metals were limiting in Oct. These results show that nutrient enrichment experiments should be performed often enough to account for seasonal changes in the physicochemical environment as well as seasonal succession in phytoplankton. The conclusion that P was the major limiting nutrient in summer is different from the conclusions of the late 1960s and early 1970s that N was the major limiting nutrient in the summer in the western basin and suggests a possible shift from N to P limitation. Pigeon Bay nutrient trend data show that summer nitrate:soluble reactive P ratios have increased from approximately 4 in the late 1960s to over 40 in the late 1970s and early 1980s, corroborating that a shift has probably occurred. This shift in nutrient limitation is probably due to reduced bioavailable P loadings and increased nitrate loadings to the western basin. The southern portion of the western basin is physicochemically different from the northern portion and may not have responded in the same manner.																			0380-1330						1984	10	4					449	460		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71862-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71862-4													WOS:A1984TY89600013

Drainage and erosion of Cambodia's great lake in the middle-late Holocene: The combined role of climatic drying, base-level fall and river capture	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We provide evidence for a large-scale geomorphic event in Cambodia's great lake, the Tonle Sap, during the middle Holocene. The present-day hydrology of the basin is dominated by an annual flood pulse where water from the Mekong River raises the lake level by c. 8 m during the monsoon season. We present new subsurface geophysical data, allied to new and past core studies, which unequivocally show a period of major mid-Holocene erosion across the entire Tonle Sap basin that is coincident with establishment of the lake's flood pulse. We argue that this widespread erosion, which removed at least 1.2 m of sediment across the lake's extent, was triggered by up to three, likely interacting, processes: (1) base-level lowering due to mid-Holocene sea-level fall, leading to (2) capture of the Tonle Sap drainage by the Mekong River, and (3) a drying climate that also reduced lake level. Longer-term landscape evolution was thus punctuated by a rapid, river capture- and base-level fall- induced, lake drainage that established the ecosystem that flourishes today. The scale of change induced by this mid-Holocene river capture event demonstrates the susceptibility of the Tonle Sap lake to ongoing changes in local base-level and hydrology induced by anthropogenic activity, such as damming and sand mining, within the Mekong River Basin.

These ponds are subsaline ecosystems characterized by a low productivity and a particularly high sulfate concentration, comparable to marine environments. This study focused on assessing the main physicochemical parameters in these ponds along with the characterization of the CH4 dynamics through the determination of fluxes, dissolved CH4 concentrations, and net methanotrophic and methanogenic activity. Despite a sulfate concentration ranging from 1.06 to 4.73 g L-1, the studied ponds showed moderate but clear CH4 production and emission, which suggests that methanogenesis is not completely outcompeted by sulfate reduction. CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.12 to 0.98 mg m(-2) d(-1), which falls within the higher range of marine emissions and within the lower range reported for coastal saline lagoons and saline ponds. During summer, significant CIH4 production in the oxic water column was observed. In addition to CH4, CO2 fluxes were determined at levels from 0.2 to 53 g m(-2) d(-1), which is within the range recorded for saline lakes in other parts of the world. Our results provide additional evidence that subsaline/saline aquatic ecosystems play an important role in the emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Carrick, HJ				Carrick, HJ			An under-appreciated component of biodiversity in plankton communities: the role of protozoa in Lake Michigan (a case study)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Biodiversity of Aquatic Ecosystems	DEC, 2003	Paul Verlaine Metz Univ, Lab Biodivers & Ecosyst Functioning Lab, Metz, FRANCE	French Limnolog Assoc	Paul Verlaine Metz Univ, Lab Biodivers & Ecosyst Functioning Lab			Recent technological advances have led to the discovery that free-living, planktonic protozoa are ubiquitous in nature and appear to be important components of pelagic food webs (e.g., fluorescent straining, flow cytometry). Despite this, limited information exists tying their seasonality to rate processes that drive succession patterns. The abundance, and seasonal growth and grazing loss of an entire protozoan assemblage were evaluated in Lake Michigan. The protozoan assemblage was species-rich (100 taxa) and abundant throughout the year in Lake Michigan. Nano-sized protozoa (Hnano and Pnano, < 20 mu m in size) ranged in abundance from 10(2) to 10(3) cells ml(-1), while micro-protozoa (Hmicro and Pmico, > 20 and < 200 mu m in size) ranged in abundance from 4 to 17 cells ml(-1). The biomass of Hnano and Hmicro by itself represented more than 70-80% of crustacean zooplankton biomass, while Pnano and Pmicro constituted nearly 50% of phytoplankton biomass. Protozoa exhibited growth rates comparable to other components of the plankton in Lake Michigan, and some populations grew at rates similar to maximum rates determined in the laboratory (rates of 1-2 day(-1)). Overall, it appears that macro-zooplankton predation is a major loss factor counter-balancing growth with only small differences between the two rate processes (< 0.1 day(-1)). Discrepancies between growth and grazing loss in the spring were likely attributed to sedimentation losses for larger species of tintinnids and dinoflagellates (Codonella, Tintinnidium, and Gymnodinium) that can account for their occurrence in the deep chlorophyll layer. In the summer, carnivory among similar sized species (Chromulina and small ciliates) may be additional loss factors impinging on the protozoan assemblage.

In this study, we reconstruct proxies for the ISM from 35 to 1 ka through detailed analysis of grain-size distribution, geochemical composition and environmental magnetism from a 7.96 m sediment core from Tengchongqinghai Lake, Yunnan Province, China. Globally recognized, abrupt climatic events, including Heinrich Events 0-3 (H0 - H3) and the Bolling-Allerod (B/A) warm period are identified in most of our proxies, and the long-term trend is consistent with other published records such as stalagmite oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) from Sangxing Cave. Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature, which is influenced by NH solar insolation, is commonly suggested to play a dominant role in controlling the ISM. A comparison of our record with the delta O-18 variations of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, a sea surface temperature (SST) record from the Bay of Bengal, and summer solar insolation at 25 N latitude demonstrates that the general pattern of ISM change does follow variations in summer insolation; however, the ISM lags summer insolation by thousands of years. While the ISM fluctuations are highly correlated with NH temperature on shorter timescales (centennial-millennial), the gradually weakened ISM from 22.5 ka until the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) indicates a close relationship with the rise of Southern Hemisphere (SH) temperature and the relatively cold background of the SH. Our record expands on the findings of ISM records from Heqing paleolake basin in southwestern China and the Arabian Sea sediments, suggesting that the NH and SH have a competitive influence on ISM by controlling the cross-equatorial pressure gradient. This relationship means that when NH temperatures are relatively high, it has a stronger influence on the ISM than SH influences. In contrast, when the SH temperature is relatively low, it has a dominant influence on ISM. In addition, we speculate that the change of SH temperature not only influences the cross-equatorial pressure gradient directly, but also likely modulates the circulation system of ocean energy by influencing the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

BS and YS are downwind of the Asian continental outflow in spring and winter as influenced by the East Asian monsoon. This makes the two seas important sinks of land-based pollutants associated with the Asian continental outflow. The sixteen U. S. EPA proposed priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in 130 surface sediment samples collected from BS and YS were measured. Combined with our previous PAH data of 90 PM2.5 samples from the upwind areas, the sources of the PAHs in BS and YS were apportioned using positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling. Four sources were identified: petroleum residue, vehicular emissions, coal combustion and biomass burning. Petroleum residue was the dominant contributor of PAHs in the coast of the Bohai Bay probably due to Haihe River runoff, oil leakage from ships and offshore oil fields. The contribution of vehicular emissions in BS was higher than that in YS, and the reverse was true for coal combustion and biomass burning. This difference in the source patterns in the sediments of the two seas could be attributed to the different PAH emission features of the upwind area related to demographic and economic conditions, as well as the marine geography. The ratios of selected 4-6 ring PAHs in the sediments compared well with those of the PM2.5 of the upwind areas, implicating that the particle phase PAHs in the atmosphere play an important role in the source to sink process of the pyrogenic PAHs in the region.

Stickleback in Walby Lake largely spawned during May and June as 2-year-olds in the second spring-summer after hatching, as was the case with other stickleback populations we studied in south-central Alaska. Contrary to an earlier hypothesis that S. solidus has been selected to delay its deleterious effects on threespine stickleback, i.e., limit its infection levels, until after the stickleback have reproduced, substantial levels of parasitic infection co-occurred with the stickleback reproductive period. Chi-squared analyses of individual samples suggested that in May, infected females were as capable of producing clutches of eggs as uninfected females but in June, S. solidus inhibited clutch production. An overall analysis, however, failed to support the hypothesis that the effect of S. solidus on clutch production differed between early and late periods of the spawning season. We concluded that S. solidus inhibits the ability of female stickleback in Walby Lake to produce a clutch, and that there was no differential effect on clutch production with season. Nonetheless, 77% of all infected females produced clutches. These results contrast with those of one study in which it was found only 9% of infected females became gravid (ripe) and another report that 23% of infected females were able to mature. We offer hypotheses for the co-occurrence of stickleback reproduction and substantial parasitism at the population level and for the ability of a large proportion of infected females to produce clutches. Our results suggest that the host-parasite relationship is more complex than was previously realized.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	1999	77	12					1967	1974		10.1139/cjz-77-12-1967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-77-12-1967													WOS:000085324800013

SSTM was collected in summer and fall from depths of 30 and 85 m in the mesotrophic northern basin of Lake Biwa, Japan. All SSTM was incubated in buffered formalin, sodium azide (NaN3) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2) solutions for a period of 56 days. The retention ratio of POC, PON and PP of SSTM was measured throughout the course of the experiments. Results showed that buffered formalin and HgCl2 were very effective in preserving POC. Although NaN3 was less effective at preventing degradation of POC, the degradation process as a function of time was described with the double-exponential decay equation extremely well. Buffered formalin and HgCl2 were also effective in preserving PON, but less effective than for POC. To ensure accurate measurements of PON vertical flux, therefore, one should estimate the decomposition kinetics of PON in sediment trap material. None of the preservatives used in this study was effective for preserving PP, which was rapidly degraded within a week. However, the degradation process was also fully described by the equation, and this will make it possible to accurately estimate PP vertical flux.

Long-term ice phenology records spanning up to 578 years for 78 lakes around the Northern Hemisphere	SCIENTIFIC DATA												In recent decades, lakes have experienced unprecedented ice loss with widespread ramifications for winter ecological processes. The rapid loss of ice, resurgence of winter biology, and proliferation of remote sensing technologies, presents a unique opportunity to integrate disciplines to further understand the broad spatial and temporal patterns in ice loss and its consequences. Here, we summarize ice phenology records for 78 lakes in 12 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia to permit the inclusion and harmonization of in situ ice phenology observations in future interdisciplinary studies. These ice records represent some of the longest climate observations directly collected by people. We highlight the importance of applying the same definition of ice-on and ice-off within a lake across the time-series, regardless of how the ice is observed, to broaden our understanding of ice loss across vast spatial and temporal scales.					; L'Abée-lund, Jan/AAE-4422-2019; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan/B-1781-2008; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Wain, Danielle/AAI-1758-2020; Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz/D-4630-2014	Knoll, Lesley/0000-0003-0347-5979; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Imrit, Mohammad Arshad/0000-0001-9760-4625; Blagrave, Kevin/0000-0002-2089-8589; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Iacono, Michael/0000-0002-9578-0649														2052-4463				JUN 16	2022	9	1							318	10.1038/s41597-022-01391-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01391-6								35710905					WOS:000812266700013
J	Trepanier, S; Rodriguez, MA; Magnan, P				Trepanier, S; Rodriguez, MA; Magnan, P			Spawning migrations in landlocked Atlantic salmon: Time series modelling of river discharge and water temperature effects	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												River discharge and water temperature are frequently cited as controlling the upstream migration of adult salmonids to their spawning areas. The results of earlier studies on the effect of these environmental Factors were examined. The statistical methods employed in some of these studies failed to consider the serial correlation often found in migration time series. To assess the effects of discharge and temperature on the migratory activity of the landlocked Atlantic salmon (ouananiche, Salmo salar), 12 years of data on spawning migrations in the Mistassini R., Quebec, Canada, were analysed and the results obtained by ordinary least squares regression and time series regression were compared. In six of the 12 years, upstream migratory movement was related negatively to changes in river how, suggesting that fish favour falling water phases for ascent. Water temperature appeared to have little effect on migratory movement. The mean body size of migrating fish decreased significantly throughout the summer; early migrants were on average 11.4% larger (mean fork length 522 mm) than late migrants (469 mm). Larger, 3-lake-year salmon migrated 7.2 days earlier than 2-lake-year salmon. Because the residuals from ordinary regression exhibited strong autocorrelation, time series regression was more appropriate than ordinary regression for the analysis of migration time series.

CONTRIBUTION OF EMERGENT AQUATIC INSECTS TO REFUELING IN SPRING MIGRANT SONGBIRDS	AUK												Refueling by spring migrant landbirds is an important determinant of arrival timing and, thus, should also affect acquisition of high-quality territories and mates. Spring migrants can encounter adverse weather and low prey availability, but emergent aquatic insects (e.g., chironomid midges) may provide an important food resource in wetland areas. We used stable-carbon-isotope (delta C-13) analysis of exhaled CO2 as an indication of recent dietary intake (contributions from aquatic or terrestrial food webs), plasma lipid metabolite profiling to assess refueling performance, and arthropod sampling to investigate whether diet and refueling differed between Lake Erie shoreline and inland forest sites and how diet, condition, and midge availability (biomass) were associated with refueling along the lakeshore in northwestern Ohio in spring 2007 and 2008. Midge availability was not associated with refueling performance for Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata), Magnolia Warblers (D. magnolia), or White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), but Magnolia Warblers had greater refueling performance as the day progressed. We detected no relationship between diet and refueling for any species; however, Yellow-rumped Warblers had a stronger aquatic delta C-13 value at two shoreline sites than at other sites. In shoreline and inland sites, migrants used a combination of aquatic and terrestrial arthropods and received energetic benefits from their use, even within small shoreline sites (1.18-2.86 ha), which often had high densities of stopover migrants. We suggest that conservation and restoration of shoreline and inland forest patches within landscapes that contain wetlands can promote refueling by migrant landbirds.

Seasonal trends in the percentage of anglers targeting yellow perch and in yellow perch harvest were apparent in creel surveys on seven lakes; trends varied among lakes. Exploitation of yellow perch was estimated on two lakes through tag-return studies. Nonreporting rates estimated from surrogate postcards varied between angler groups (19-52%). On East 81 Slough, where the relative stock density (RSD) of yellow perch of 254 mm or longer (RSD-254) was low (RSD-254 = 10), exploitation was only 7% during the winter of 2000-2001; much of the total annual mortality (48%) in the population was attributed to natural causes (40%). Conversely, the estimated exploitation rate on Pelican Lake, where size Structure was dominated by larger fish (RSD-254 = 92), was 61% from December to June. Anglers on East 81 Slough demonstrated size-selective harvest of yellow perch, harvesting higher proportions of older, larger fish than were observed in trap-net samples. High percentages of anglers on both takes reported preferences for catching or harvesting fewer, larger yellow perch rather than catching or harvesting more, but smaller, fish. Variation in the size structure of the yellow perch available to anglers will probably result in variable exploitation rates both among populations and among years within a single population. Angler catch preferences and size selectivity suggest that future management strategies should be designed to provide reasonable numbers of large yellow perch to meet angler desires.

J	Tan, L; Wang, ZZ; Bai, Y; Huang, XR				Tan, Lang; Wang, Zongzhi; Bai, Ying; Huang, Xiaorong			Short-term responses of nutrients and algal biomass in a eutrophic shallow lake to different scales of water transfer	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												With the expansion of water transfer projects worldwide, the original hydrological and physicochemical states of the systems receiving the transferred water have experienced dynamic temporal and spatial changes, especially shallow lakes with that are more vulnerable to these changes. Understanding the short-term response of lakes to human -managed water transfer events can provide specific information on the seasonal regularity and long-term evolution pattern of lakes. The present study selected an annual water transfer event that is uniform and relatively independent. Then, field monitoring was conducted, and a hydrodynamic-eutrophication model was established to investigate the effects of the water transfer scales and regulation on TN, TP and algal biomass in Lake Nansi, a main regulating lake on the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWDP-ER), China. The results showed that the timing of the water transfer event had an important effect on the enrichment of algal biomass. When the water transfer occurred in the spring, algal growth increased, but the reverse occurred in the summer. Under a high P concentration and the current management regulations (TP 0.05 mg/L), an algal bloom resulted in 21 % and 22 % increases in Chl-a and TP in the receiving system. When the inflow rate increased to the maximum level (100 m3/s), the algal biomass in the first mixing zone was briefly diluted, but the subsequent deterioration in water quality in the first mixing zone was more significant. Sixty days after the water transfer event began, the proportion of middle eutrophication (26 <= Chl-a < 160 mu g/L) increased from 84 % to 92 %. The results emphasize the importance of water transfer scales on water quality in shallow lakes and provide a reference for determining the long-term stability and maintenance of specific ecosystems and optimization of water transfer practices.					; Huang, Xiaorong/GVU-4903-2022	Wang, Zongzhi/0000-0003-0521-158X; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUL 1	2023	880								163321	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163321		APR 2023						37030389					WOS:000980972900001

In Denmark, climate is projected to cause increased precipitation in winter and increased air temperatures throughout the year by the end of the 21st century. Looking further into the future, the warming trend is projected to continue and likely reach a 6 degrees C increase around the 22nd century (relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005). In the present study, we evaluate the consequences of such extreme changes for temperate Danish lakes. We use a multifaceted modelling approach by combining an eco-hydrological model to estimate future water runoff and catchment nutrient exports with both mechanistic and empirical lake models, describing key biogeochemical indicators in lakes, in order to quantify the effects of future nutrient loads and air temperature on lake ecosystems. Our model projections for the future scenario suggest that annual water runoff will increase (46%), driving also increases in exports of nitrogen and phosphorus (13 and 64%, respectively). Both the mechanistic and empirical modelling approaches suggest that phytoplankton biomass will increase and that potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria may become a dominant feature of the phytoplankton community from spring. Warming and increased nutrient loads also affect the food webs within the lakes in the direction of higher fish control of algae-grazing water fleas, further reinforcing eutrophication. To be able to mitigate these eutrophication effects, external nutrient loading to the lakes must be reduced considerably.

PETROGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATION OF TUFA MOUNDS AND CARBONATE BEDS IN THE JURASSIC NAVAJO SANDSTONE OF SOUTHEASTERN UTAH, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Carbonate deposits in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of Utah reflect deposition in interdune lakes and springs. Interdune-lake deposits consist of flat-lying carbonate units. Springs formed tufa mounds that are interpreted as subaerial, ambient-temperature, artesian-spring deposits. In the first systematic study of the petrography of the carbonate deposits in the Navajo Sandstone, eleven facies were identified in several flat-lying carbonate deposits and two tufa mounds. Fenestral mudstone and peloidal facies dominate the lacustrine deposits, whereas thrombolitic mudstone characterizes the mounds. The biota consists of ostracodes, charophytes, fish, mollusks, a possible freshwater sponge, trace fossils, and fragments of vascular plants. Features resulting from penecontemporaneous weathering provide evidence of episodic exposure of the lacustrine carbonate beds during deposition and formation of the tufa mounds under subaerial conditions. Although carbonate deposits are not rare in eolian systems, few have been studied in detail; comparisons between these and the Navajo Sandstone carbonate deposits reveal some characteristics that may be unique to the latter.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				SEP 1	2017	87	9					967	985		10.2110/jsr.2017.56	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2017.56													WOS:000435183500003

The only genes detected were eae and stx(2), which were carried by 37.69% (n=248) of the isolates. Only eae was harbored by 26.74% (n=176) of the isolates, representing potential atypical EPEC strains, while only stx(2) was detected in 10.33% (n=68) of the isolates, indicating potential STEC strains. Moreover, four isolates were positive for both the stx(2) and eae genes, representing potential EHEC strains. The prevalence of VGs (eae or stx(2)) was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in the fall season, and multiple genes (eae plus stx(2)) were detected only in fall. Repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprint analysis of 658 E. coli isolates identified 335 unique fingerprints, with an overall Shannon diversity (H') index of 3.653. Diversity varied among seasons over the years, with relatively higher diversity during fall. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that the majority of the fingerprints showed a tendency to cluster according to year, season, and month. Taken together, the results indicated that the diversity and population structure of E. coli fluctuate on a temporal scale, reflecting the presence of diverse host sources and their behavior over time in the watershed. Furthermore, the occurrence of potentially pathogenic E. coli strains in the drinking water intakes highlights the risk to human health associated with direct and indirect consumption of untreated surface water.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2015	81	5					1779	1789		10.1128/AEM.03738-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03738-14								25548059					WOS:000349547200027

Lakes and wetlands -the most abundant inland water bodies- are particularly affected. This study assessed the impacts of anthropogenic interventions on the hydrological dynamics and surface water-groundwater interactions in artificially connected shallow lakes of the Southern Pampa plain (La Chanchera-La Brava system). A small, unconnected lake (Medano de Castro lake) was also analyzed. The canal-connected lakes and associated groundwater are alkaline (mean pH 8.6), brackish (TDS from 1.6 to 13.2 g L-1), and of the sodium-chloride/sodium-non-dominant type, exhibiting minimal seasonal variations. In contrast, the unconnected Medano de Castro lake has sodium bicarbonate-type waters, with salinity increasing from 6.7 g L-1 in the dry (austral winter) to 12.3 g L-1 in the wet (austral summer) seasons. Isotopic modeling (delta O-18) applied in both La Chanchera and Medano de Castro lakes indicates that groundwater inflow occurs year-round, at rates approximately seven times higher in the wet season due to water table rising. Both lakes are throughflow systems with short water residence times (<1 year), indicating a constant water exchange. The hydrochemical and isotopic evidence indicates that the Medano the Castro lake receives local groundwater recharge from the surrounding dunes, imparting a bicarbonate signature and preventing its desiccation. In contrast, the canal-connected La Chanchera lake receives the input from regional groundwater with a chloride-sulfate composition. This study highlights the importance of understanding lake-groundwater dynamics in regions facing agricultural expansion and climate pressures.

J	DABROWSKI, KR				DABROWSKI, KR			ENERGY BUDGET OF COREGONID (COREGONUS SPP) FISH GROWTH, METABOLISM AND REPRODUCTION	OIKOS												Data on pollan (Coregonus autumnalis pollan Thompson) in Lough Neagh, N. Ireland [UK] and vendace (C. albula L.) in the Mazurian lakes, Poland, provided the material for the quantitative evaluation of energy allocation to fish growth, metabolism and reproduction. The annual growth pattern of these two coregonid species differs considerably due mostly to their distribution and lake water temperatures. In summer, when most growth occurs in vendace, respiratory energy contributes 41-49% of energy consumed, whereas for female pollan the corresponding value is 51-66%. Energy partitioning into reproductive tissue attained its maximum before spawning in November, 23% of energy consumed in vendace and 21-27% in pollan (3-4 yr old females). However, such expression of reproductive effort in coregonid fish is misleading since both species lose substantial amounts of theire body reserves in November, 15.2% in the case of pollan, 38.0% in vendace. It appears that in vendace, lake water temperatures in summer are very favourable for high growth without resulting in marked increase of metabolic requirements. In the case of pollan, the prolonged growing season permits increased consumption and diminishes body energy loss due to the development of the ovary, but high water temperatures appear unfavourable for growth in summer. A comparison of the allocation of energy pattern to growth, metabolism and reproduction between coregonid and other species of fish it presented.

Boiling chloride spring waters discharge over a 30 m vertical interval from the Steaming Cliffs along the western shore of Lake Rotomahana (similar to 340 m asl) to inferno Crater (373 m asl) in the upper Waimangu Valley. K-Na and K-Mg ratios, aqueous silica concentrations and Delta O-18((sulfate-water)) values of spring waters, indicate deep equilibration temperatures that range from 200 to 280 degrees C, while uniform B/Cl ratios (similar to 0.0075) suggest the chloride waters derive from a single reservoir. Stable isotope data are best explained as the result of boiling and dilution in the upper part (<2 lan depth) of the system, with an interpreted parent liquid composition of Cl=585 mg/kg, delta(18)O = -4.75 parts per thousand, and delta D = -37.5 parts per thousand. This liquid is distinct from the parent inferred for the nearby Waiotapu geothermal system and is positively enriched in both delta(18)O and delta D compared to focal meteoric water (delta(18)O = -6.85 parts per thousand, delta D = -42 parts per thousand). Boiling upflow is interpreted to dominate beneath all surface features except in the vicinity of Lake Rotomahana, where a cold hydrostatic cap (similar to 100 m thick) depresses the temperature gradient of rising fluids discharging at Steaming Cliffs. The effects of ground water dilution generally increase with hot spring elevation in response to a steepening hydraulic gradient and rugged topography associated with the volcanic craters of Waimangu Valley. A minimum chloride Bur estimate of 80-100 g/s corresponds to athermal output of 150 to 190 MW.

To quantify spatial patterns of lake responses (temperature, mixing, ice cover, evaporation) we ran the lake model for theoretical lakes of specified area, depth, and transparency over a uniformly spaced (50 lan) grid. The simulations were conducted for two 10-year periods that represent present climatic conditions and those around the time of CO2 doubling. Although the climate model output produces simulated lake responses that differ in specific regional details, there is broad agreement with regard to the direction and area of change. In particular, lake temperatures are generally warmer in the future as a result of warmer climatic conditions and a substantial loss (> 100 days/yr) of winter ice cover. Simulated summer lake temperatures are higher than 30 degrees C over the Midwest and south, suggesting the potential for future disturbance of existing aquatic ecosystems. Overall increases in lake evaporation combine with disparate changes in A/OGCM precipitation to produce future changes in net moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) that are of less fidelity than those of lake temperature.					; Small, eric/K-6007-2015	Small, ERIC/0000-0002-5010-4954; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	1999	35	6					1625	1637		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04241.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb04241.x													WOS:000084624600027

Benthic metabolism and nitrogen dynamics in an urbanised tidal creek: Domination of DNRA over denitrification as a nitrate reduction pathway	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes and nitrate reduction rates were determined seasonally under light and dark conditions at three sites in a micro-tidal creek within an urbanised catchment (Saltwater Creek, Australia). It was hypothesized that stormwater inputs of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen would stimulate rates of benthic metabolism and nutrient recycling and preferentially stimulate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) over denitrification as a pathway for nitrate reduction. Stormwaters greatly influenced water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and suspended solids concentrations with values following a large rainfall event being 5-20-fold greater than during the preceding dry period. Seasonally, maximum and minimum water column total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and DIN concentrations occurred in the summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons. Creek sediments were highly heterotrophic throughout the year, and strong sinks for oxygen, and large sources of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen during both light and dark incubations, although micro-phytobenthos (MPB) significantly decreased oxygen consumption and N-effluxes during light incubations due to photosynthetic oxygen production and photoassimilation of nutrients. Benthic denitrification rates ranged from 3.5 to 17.7 mu mol N m(2) h(-1), denitrification efficiencies were low (<1-15%) and denitrification was a minor process compared to DNRA, which accounted for similar to 75% of total nitrate reduction. Overall, due to the low denitrification efficiencies and high rates of N-regeneration, Saltwater Creek sediments would tend to increase rather than reduce dissolved nutrient loads to the downstream Gold Coast Broadwater and Moreton Bay systems. This may be especially true during wet periods when increased inputs of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and suspended solids could respectively enhance rates of N-regeneration and decrease light availability to MPB, reducing their capacity to ameliorate N-effluxes through photoassimilation.

EM1 and EM2, with a modal value of 13 and 10 m, respectively, indicate the variation of local hydraulic conditions. EM3, with a modal value of 5 m, reflects the background atmospheric dust loading. High atmospheric dust concentration generally occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5d, MIS 4, and early MIS 3, when the climate in the Asian dust source region was cold and dry. In contrast, low dust concentration prevailed during MIS 2, likely due to the southward shift of the westerlies driven by maximum ice volume in the high latitudes.

Using satellite tracking, we followed 11 White-naped Cranes (Grus vipio) on migration from their breeding grounds in eastern Russia to their wintering grounds in China and Japan. From 1991 to 1993, we captured cranes with the aid of helicopters and attached satellite transmitters (platform transmitter terminals) to captured birds via a harness system. We tracked cranes for 156 days on average, across 2558 km, and obtained an average of 339 locations per crane. Cranes migrated over 8-90 days. During migration, birds spent 1-30 days at 4-12 rest sites. Cranes wintered at two main sites: Poyang Lake, China, and Izumi, Japan. All seven cranes migrating to the Poyang Lake area rested at the Yellow River delta-Bohai Bay, China, and all three traveling to Izumi rested in the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula. Other important rest sites were marshes around the Wulagai River, Huainan, Hu-Lun Lake, Linyi, Tangshan, the Three Rivers (Sanjiang) Plain, Tianjin, and the Xar Moron River, all in China, and Lake Khanka-Xinghai at the border of China and Russia. The habitats resting cranes used most frequently were plains, including upland areas, marshes, and rivers. Although nature reserves exist at the two main wintering sites of Poyang Lake and Izumi, rest sites used by cranes were poorly protected. Even when areas used by cranes for resting or wintering were included in nature reserves, reserves were threatened by human encroachment and development. To ensure that cranes can continue to migrate successfully, it is crucial that the establishment of reserves continues at important rest areas and that the areas covered by reserves at wintering sites be extended to include more of the areas utilized by cranes. Also, development and human disturbance should be minimized in reserve areas. Because long-distance migrant birds, including cranes, range over such large areas, conservation of these organisms and their habitats necessitates multinational communication and cooperation.

While this relationship is likely due to greater extent of undisturbed habitats in larger lakes, we understand little of the drivers affecting individual behaviours behind this tendency. Methods We tracked wintering movements of three duck species (Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Falcated Duck M. falcata and Northern Pintail Anas acuta) using GPS transmitters, examining differences between the two largest lakes and other smaller lakes in ducks' habitat use, duration of stay at each lake and the daily distances moved by the tagged birds while at these sites. Results The Eurasian Wigeon and Falcated Duck stayed five times longer and almost exclusively used natural habitat types at the two large lakes (91-95% of positions) compared to length of stay time at smaller lakes, where they spent 28-33 days on average (excluding the capture site) and exploited many more different habitats (including c. 50% outside lakes). Conclusions Our study is the first to show that shorter length of stay and more varied habitat use by ducks at small lakes may contribute to explaining the apparent regional concentration of numbers present of these and other species at the largest lakes in recent years. This compares with their declining abundance at smaller lakes, where habitat loss and degradation has been more manifest than on the larger lakes.

Are life history events of a northern breeding population of Cooper's Hawks influenced by changing climate?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Numerous studies have demonstrated earlier timing of spring migration and egg-laying in small passerines, but documentation of such responses to recent climate change in the life histories of higher trophic feeding birds such as raptors is relatively scarce. Raptors may be particularly susceptible to possible adverse effects of climate change due to their longer generation turnover times and lower reproductive capacity, which could lead to population declines because of an inability to match reproductive timing with optimal brood rearing conditions. Conversely adaptively favorable outcomes due to the influence of changing climate may occur. In general, birds that seasonally nest earlier typically have higher reproductive output compared to conspecifics that nest later in the season. Given the strong seasonal decline in reproductive output, and the heritability of nesting phenology, it is possible that nesting seasons would (adaptively) advance over time. Recent climate warming may release prior ecological constraints on birds that depend on food availability at the time of egg production, as do various raptors including Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii). Under this scenario, productivity, especially clutch size, might increase because it is likely that this reproductive demographic may be the most immediate response to the earlier seasonal presence of food resources. We demonstrated a statistically significant shift of about 4-5 days to an earlier timing of egg-hatching in spring across 36 years during 1980-2015 for a partially migratory population of Cooper's Hawks in Wisconsin, United States, which is consistent with a recent study that showed that Cooper's Hawks had advanced their timing of spring migration during 1979-2012. Both studies occurred in the Great Lakes region, an area that compared to global averages is experiencing earlier and increased warming particularly in the spring in Wisconsin. The nesting period did not lengthen. We suggest that the gradual shift of six consecutive generations of hawks was likely in response to recent climate change or warming. We did not detect any long-term temporal change in average clutch or brood sizes. However, such indices of reproduction are among the highest known for the species and thus may be at their physio-ecological maximum for this population. Our study population appears to show resilience to and does not appear to be adversely influenced by the recent rate of changing climate at this time.																			2045-7758					JAN	2017	7	1					399	408		10.1002/ece3.2619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2619								28070302					WOS:000392069500033
J	Stich, HB; Brinker, A				Stich, H. B.; Brinker, Alexander			Oligotrophication outweighs effects of global warming in a large, deep, stratified lake ecosystem	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Between 1951 and 1979, total phosphorous concentrations in Lake Constance increased from 7 to 87 mu g L-1. Following wastewater treatment, phosphorus levels were brought under control, returning to 7.6 mu g L-1 by spring 2007. The biological and chemical data from 1980 to 2004 were first modelled by seasonal time series analyses and then used to create a general model. Excluding collinear variables allowed the data set to be condensed to six variables that could be fitted into a general linear model that explained similar to 75% of the observed annual variation in chlorophyll a. A clear seasonal influence was apparent, with chlorophyll a tracking trends in temperature and the progress of spring. A nonseasonal influence was also observed in the interaction of two biological components, the proportion of phytoplankton biomass available to Daphnia (i.e. the percentage of ingestible size < 30 mu m) and the grazing intensity. In combination, these biotic variables had a negative impact on chlorophyll a levels. In contrast, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) correlated positively with chlorophyll a. The effect of SRP showed a significant seasonal component, as it was more abundant in spring than at other times of year. In general, the model predicts a negative exponential response of chlorophyll a to further depletion of SRP in Lake Constance, while the temperature trends predicted by current global warming scenarios will result in a moderate increase in productivity. Data from 2005 to 2007 were used to verify the model. The modelled chlorophyll a values were nonbiased and showed a close match to the measured values (r2: 75%). Thus the applicability, reliability, and informative value of the model for pelagic Lake Constance was confirmed. The approach might easily be applied to other waters.

J	Alcocer, J; Escobar-Briones, E				Alcocer, Javier; Escobar-Briones, Elva			On the ecology of Caecidotea williamsi Escobar-Briones & Alcocer (Crustacea&COLFAML; Isopoda: Asellidae) from Alchichica saline Lake, Central Mexico	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Caecidotea williamsi Escobar-Briones & Alcocer (2002) is the first asellid described from a saline aquatic habitat in America, Alchichica crater-lake, Puebla, Central Mexico. No previous reports exist for asellid isopods from inland saline waters in America in spite of the extensive research undertaken so far on the continent. Differing from other asellids, C. williamsi inhabits saline waters (i.e. 8.5 g l(-1)) dominated by sodium, magnesium, chloride, and bicarbonate ions and markedly alkaline (pH 9.0 +/- 0.1). Water temperature ranges from 14.5 degrees C throughout the water column in winter and in the deep waters for the rest of the year, up to 20 degrees C in the surface waters in summer. C. williamsi occurs in a depth range of surface to 30 m (lake's maximum depth is 64 m), below which an anoxic layer is found during 9 months of the year. Generally it lives cryptically in tufa crevices and at shallower depths many inhabit empty trichopteran cases embedded within the tufa crevices. Some specimens are heavily covered by epizooic ciliates on the thoracic and abdominal segments of the exoskeleton and the pleopods. Data are presented on the diet, possible predators, saprobity and trophism, and regional distribution of C. williamsi. The continued survival of this unique isopod is threatened by anthropogenic desiccation of its habitat.

Among 150 sites, milfoil presence declined from 2008 levels of 34 (23%) sites to 2 (1%) sites by 2015 coincident with cumulative stocking of 259,500 weevils from 2007 to 2014. Severe winter temperatures also were associated with milfoil declines. Each 1 degrees C decline in average low temperature during the preceding winter was associated with 3.4 (95% CI 0.8-6.1) fewer sites with milfoil. Impacts of weevil herbivory on watermilfoil may be accentuated by severe winter temperatures. Lake managers should, when possible, integrate weather conditions with weevil stocking regimes to control Eurasian watermilfoil.

Grains size, sediment chemistry and magnetic susceptibility records are compared with the pollen and plant macrofossil records on the basis of which biome and quantitative summer mean temperature reconstructions are provided and discussed with other climate records of the region. Biome assignments indicated (graminoid and forb) tundra vegetation from 19,440 cal yr BP with the local presence of Betula pendula, B. pubescens, B. nana, and Pinus sylvestris. A rapid biome shift to cool coniferous forest took place at 16,200 cal yr BP, and a second biome shift was identified at 14,740 cal yr BP when cool mixed forest developed and persisted into the Early Holocene. The most prominent feature of the record was the early post last glacial maximum (LGM) establishment (17,700 cal yr BP) and expansion (14,700 cal yr BP) of elm (Ulmus) and hazel (Corylus) supporting the phylogeographical evidence for extra-Mediterranean refugia in the Pannonian Basin. The fungal spore record indicated the presence of large grazing mammals locally after the LGM until similar to 16,780 cal yr BP. Their disappearance predated the biome shift to cold coniferous forest and the final increase of forest fires. Pollen based summer temperature reconstruction suggested relatively warm summers (similar to 14.5 degrees C) by 19,440 cal yr BP, and buffered July mean temperature fluctuations throughout the last glacial termination in this region with < 1 degrees C decrease in summer mean temperatures during the Younger Dryas stadial, and similar to 2.2 degrees C warming in the Early Holocene. Our comprehensive summary of the basin's Late Pleniglacial (24,000-14,600 cal yr BP) and late glacial paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate records showed a partially wooded landscape with higher woody cover in Western Hungary. Several loess and lake archives confirmed that in this region of Europe the warming after Heinrich event 1 (around 16,200 cal yr BP) had similar amplitude to the late glacial warming.

The Chowan, which serves as an important recreational area and provides critical nursery habitat for multiple vulnerable species, has garnered much attention in recent years due to recurrent cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) associated with microcystins (MCs). Here we document unprecedented toxic blooms of Microcystis spp. during summer and fall of 2019 with MC concentrations two to three orders above the recreational guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2019). Based on 16S sequencing results in this study and previously published reports, the genus Microcystis emerged as a primary concern within the region. Shifts in assemblage composition, including relative abundance of Microcystis spp. and contributions from potential MC-degraders, linked to overall toxin concentrations and bloom stage. Congeners of varying toxicity, mainly MC-RR and MC-LR, were the most prevalent, corroborating that congeners other than MC-LR should be considered as health risk guidelines are developed. Downstream toxin transport was indicated based on changes in accumulated dissolved MC within the western Albemarle Sound which matched toxin dynamics in the Chowan River. This study provides important novel data on bacterial community composition, MC dynamics, and spatial connectivity for the Chowan River region that can aid monitoring approaches and management strategies for the protection of public health along the Chowan River and within the western Albemarle Sound.					; Schnetzer, Astrid/F-2527-2010	Schaeffer, Blake/0000-0001-9794-3977; Schnetzer, Astrid/0000-0003-2063-0635													1568-9883	1878-1470				DEC	2024	140								102747	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102747		NOV 2024						39613371					WOS:001407773700001

Fish specimens collected during the period from January 2022 to December 2022 were selected to represent all fish size categories in the catch. The age distribution covered age groups Ito V. Total length ranged from 8 to 17.8 cm, while total weight varied from 10.57 to 87.65 g. There was no significant difference between the length-weight relation (LWR) parameters of sexes and pooled data. The overall LWR was found to be W=0.0112xL(3.0496). It was found that both males and females matured at a total length of about 12.3cm for males and 12.7 cm for females. The natural spawning period for P. stridens in Lake Timsah is at the end of spring and early summer, from May to July. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were not significantly different between males and females. The model parameters for both sexes were: L-infinity=21.01 cm, K= 0. 245, and t0=-1.5475. The annual rates of total, natural and fishing mortality for male and female P. stridens were calculated as 2.0405 (Yr-1), 0.6367 (Yr-1), 1.4038 (Yr-1) and 2.0151(Yr-1), 0.7035 Yr-1, 1.3116 (Yr-1) , respectively.

Precipitation at Lake Qinghai, NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and its relation to Asian summer monsoons on decadal/interdecadal scales during the past 500 years	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Knowledge of the variability of precipitation at Lake Qinghai and its relation to the Asian summer monsoons is helpful in constraining global climatic dynamics. Based on the high-resolution precipitation indicators of delta C-13 of the organic matter (delta C-13(org)) C/N atomic ratio, and the detrended total organic carbon content (TOCdetrended), we found that the trend of precipitation at Lake Qinghai is inversely correlated to that of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) inferred from layer thickness of a stalagmite (S3) in southern Oman on decadal/interdecadal scales. The Chinese Drought/Flood (D/F) indices, which can indicate the dryness/wetness over large geographic areas, are also used to indicate the intensity of the monsoon rainfall. The D/F index of Xining near Lake Qinghai is synchronous with those of the regions in northern China where the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) dominates; while it is anti-phase with those of southwestem China where ISM prevails. These materials suggest that, during the past 500 years, the source of moisture to Lake Qinghai on decadal/interdecadal scales is controlled mainly by the EASM, but not by the ISM. It is also suggested that the intensity of EASM is inversely related to that of the ISM on decadal/interdecadal scales. The decadal/interdecadal variability of ENSO may be responsible for the inverse relationship between the intensity of EASM and that of ISM. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PCR detection of the invA gene, that encodes a protein of a type III secretion system present in salmonellae, after semi-selective enrichment of salmonellae was achieved in biofilms from all 20 locations at the City Park site, with locations generally being positive 2-3 times out of 4 sampling times for a total of 59% positive samples. InvA gene fragment detection in biofilms was less frequent for the 5 sampling times and 20 locations from the Spring Lake site (18% of all samples), with 1 sampling time being entirely negative and 8 locations remaining negative throughout the study. Rep-PCR fingerprinting of 491 Salmonella isolates obtained from both sites resulted in 30 distinct profiles, with 26 and 7 profiles retrieved from City Park and Spring Lake samples, respectively, and thus with 3 profiles present at both sites, and multiple strains frequently obtained from single locations at both sites. The composition of Salmonella strains in the area analyzed changed in time with large differences between early (April, June) and late sampling times (September) within and among sites, except for one strain (S12) that was present at almost all sampling times at both sites, though often at different locations within the area analyzed. These results demonstrate the presence of salmonellae in natural biofilms and a significant micro-heterogeneity with differences in diversity and persistence of salmonellae. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Louise; Sih, Andrew			Fish-Habitat Relationships Along the Estuarine Gradient of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California: Implications for Habitat Restoration	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Estuaries are highly variable environments where fish are subjected to a diverse suite of habitat features (e.g., water quality gradients, physical structure) that filter local assemblages from a broader, regional species pool. Tidal, climatological, and oceanographic phenomena drive water quality gradients and, ultimately, expose individuals to other habitat features (e.g., stationary physical or biological elements, such as bathymetry or vegetation). Relationships between fish abundances, water quality gradients, and other habitat features in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were examined as a case example to learn how habitat features serve as filters to structure local assemblages in large river-dominated estuaries. Fish communities were sampled in four tidal lakes along the estuarine gradient during summer-fall 2010 and 2011 and relationships with habitat features explored using ordination and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Based on ordination results, landscape-level gradients in salinity, turbidity, and elevation were associated with distinct fish assemblages among tidal lakes. Native fishes were associated with increased salinity and turbidity, and decreased elevation. Within tidal lakes, GLMM results demonstrated that submersed aquatic vegetation density was the dominant driver of individual fish species densities. Both native and non-native species were associated with submersed aquatic vegetation, although native and non-native fish populations only minimally overlapped. These results help to provide a framework for predicting fish species assemblages in novel or changing habitats as they indicate that species assemblages are driven by a combination of location within the estuarine gradient and site-specific habitat features.

Repeated Cold Exposure Effects on Mortality and Feeding Activity of the Salvinia Weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Biological control of the aquatic fern, Salvinia molesta D. S. Mitchell, by Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in temperate regions has been less reliable relative to tropical and subtropical regions. High mortality of overwintering adults is presumed to be an important factor. At temperate sites, overwintering adult C. salviniae may experience multiple exposures to low temperatures that could compound to lethal levels. We examined the effects of repeated cold exposure (RCE) on the overwintering mortality and feeding rate of adult C. salviniae. Mortality rate of adults following exposure to 2, 4, and 6 cycles of RCE was 22, 70 and 82%, respectively. Mortality in the RCE treatment was similar to that in the matched-cold treatment for 2 and 6 cycles but was significantly less than in the matched-cold treatment for the 4 cycles. The relationship between the number of RCE and adult mortality rate was modeled and model results were compared to adult survival of caged weevils during four winters on two lakes in northeast Texas. Also, the feeding activity of adult weevils surviving RCE declined following exposure to 4 and 6 cycles of RCE. These results provide insight into how cold impacts overwintering survival of C. salviniae and should assist in anticipating the need for inoculative releases of C. salviniae the following spring to achieve consistent biological control of S. molesta at temperate locales.

We compared 22 such cuitivars in a 1-year-old 'Syrah' wine-grape vineyard located at 1,400 feet in Lake County. We found significant differences between species in the amount of biomass produced in 2004 and 2005. All of the species studied were relatively low statured and fit well in vineyard middles. Pressure bomb readings taken after the cover crops stopped growing showed that with a dry spring (2004), vines with cover crops were modestly more stressed than those under tillage prior to July but after irrigation the cover-cropped vines were slightly less stressed In 2005, which had rainfall in date spring, there were no differences in vine water status throughout the season. We conclude that water use)by the cover crop must have been relatively low and did not result in excessive vine water stress.																			0008-0845					OCT-DEC	2008	62	4					191	194		10.3733/ca.v062n04p191	http://dx.doi.org/10.3733/ca.v062n04p191													WOS:000260051400017
J	COLGAN, DJ; PONDER, WF				COLGAN, DJ; PONDER, WF			THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF RESTRICTIONS ON GENE FLOW - EXAMPLES FROM HYDROBIID SNAILS	NAUTILUS					Symposium on Molecular Techniques and Molluscan Phylogeny, at the 11th International Malacological Congress	AUG 31-SEP 05, 1992	SIENA, ITALY					The evolutionary consequences of restrictions on gene flow are discussed in relation to the population genetic structure and speciation of four Australian hydrobiid snail faunas. The studied faunas comprise: (1) the brackish water genus Tatea; (2) species of Fluvidona in freshwater streams at Wilsons Promontory; (3) species of Fonscochlea and Trochidrobia in artesian springs near Lake Eyre in South Australia; and (4) species of an undescribed genus at Dalhousie Springs in northern South Australia, another arid zone artesian spring complex. Gene flow in these hydrobiids is very variable. It is high in Tatea, relatively high at Dalhousie Springs and extremely low in Wilsons Promontory and the Lake Eyre springs. Levels in the latter two faunas are similar despite a great disparity in geographic area. In these four faunas, the detail of gene flow patterns is complex, emphasising the dependence of population structure on the interaction of current and historical factors. This is illustrated by speciation patterns, the numbers of species and their distributions usually correlating well with observed levels of gene flow. However, there are examples, among species groups with comparable, but very low gene flow, in which some taxa have undergone speciation yet others have not. The data were analysed using F-statistics and the private allele frequency approaches. Whilst the qualitative conclusions from the two approaches were generally similar, the exceptions usually indicated (on biogeographic grounds), that the F-statistics approach is the more reliable estimator of gene flow. The private alleles approach is dependent on a coincidence of the scale of sampling with the biological scale of population sub-division. Intensive sampling schemes, as utilised in our studies, tend to find even rare alleles in more than one population even though they may be quite restricted in geographical distribution. An analytical method for treating conditional allelic frequencies would not be as sensitive to this problem as the private alleles approach.

The total poundage of fish recovered by seining and poisoning 110-acre Beaver Dam Lake was 56,983. Average total lengths in inches of gizzard shad at various ages composing a 1136-fish sample were young-of-the-year in August 3.4, and in December, 5.8; fish in second summer of life, 9.6; in third summer, 11.1; in fourth summer, 13.2; and in fifth summer, 15.0. Age was determined by analysis of growth rings (annuli) on scales; the method is shown to be valid for this species. Previous growth expressed as average lengths at successive annuli was computed from an empirically determined ratio of body-length to scale length. On this basis, total lengths in inches at successive annuli were: I, 6.2; II, 10.3; III, 12.1; IV, 14.0. Length was related to weight as W = CLn [W in ounces, L in inches], where log C = -2.2789 and n = 3.034.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1951	15	4					357	360		10.2307/3796578	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796578													WOS:A1951YB65500004

This lagoon in central Japan is under a complicated climate system influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), and strong typhoon events. Diatom assemblages and chemical components of a 1.3 m sediment core suggest historical events of rapid salination and cyclical ecosystem shifts accompanied by monsoon condition changes. Most research has indicated that Lake Hamana changed from a freshwater lake to a brackish lagoon because of the Meio earthquake in 1498 CE. However, based on results from the diatom assemblage and chemical components, this salination occurred because of changes in the Hamana paleoriver flow, and this change happened before the earthquake, around the mid-15th century. Furthermore, it is clear that Lake Hamana was an oligohaline lagoon before salination. The lithology of the lake sediments and the diatom assemblage changed during the LIA; sand, water, and total diatom contents decreased. However, the relative abundance of marine diatom taxa increased during the LIA. These changes were introduced by a weakening EASM coupled with low precipitation under low solar activity during the LIA. Several flood events represented by freshwater diatom taxa and magnetic susceptibility peaks co-occurred with strong El Nino events during the LIA. It is inferred that this strong El Nino during the LIA induced frequent typhoons causing floods in central Japan.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				JUL 31	2019	223						39	49		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.033													WOS:000469152500005
J	Ueta, M; Ryabtsev, VV				Ueta, M; Ryabtsev, VV			Migration routes of four juvenile Imperial Eagles Aquila heliaca from the Baikal region of eastern Russia	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												From 1950 to 1999 there was a substantial decrease in the number of Imperial Eagles Aquila heliaca breeding in the Baikal region of eastern Russia, but there have been no apparent changes in habitat or breeding success within this region. Identification of wintering and stopover sites is therefore necessary to discover whether negative impacts at these sites could be causing the observed population decline. To this end, we satellite-tracked four juvenile Imperial Eagles from Lake Baikal to their wintering grounds. Two sibling eagles were tracked in 1998 and two siblings from a different brood in 1999. The eagles migrated through eastern Mongolia and central Inner Mongolia (China), and wintered from south China to Thailand. Siblings independently used the same migration flyway, and the flyway was different between families. These results provide useful information for determining the causes of the decline in the population of Imperial Eagles in the Baikal region.																			0959-2709					JUN	2001	11	2					93	99																WOS:000170345800002

Uranium-series dating of the tufas confirms that at least five episodes of tufa deposition are represented in Kharga, although not every event is represented at, each locality. Across the region studied, tufas were most frequently deposited as part of a fluvial barrage system, characterized by terraced, vegetated pools impounded by arcuate tufa dams and separated by small waterfalls. Available water resources during pluvial phases would have included not only spring-fed streams but also small freshwater lakes. While Earlier Stone Age (ESA) mid Middle Stone Age (MSA) lithic artifacts may be found either as surficial lags on tufas, or, less commonly, encased within tufas, Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic artifacts are generally found in or on silts within surface deflation depressions in the tufas, principally at Wadi Midauwara.

The park is characterized by very important water resources, including Ifni Lake, which is the highest natural lake in Morocco (with an elevation of 2320 m). This lake is located on the southern side of Mt. Toubkal. This area has never been the object of an environmental or hydrological study. The objective of the current study was the characterization of Ifni Lake and the spring waters located in this area, as the basis of a framework to protect natural resources in northern Africa. The hydrochemical composition of water determines its origin and relationship with its catchment. Hydrochemical studies were carried out to assess the ions water composition, and processes governing the hydrochemistry of Ifni Lake water and the springs in the study area. A total of 20 water samples were collected in 2013 and analyzed for various parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, and major ions. The physico-chemical analysis of the Ifni Lake water showed that this is the least mineralized water studied in this region, having a bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium as dominate ions. Also there is a relationship between the hydrochemical composition of Ifni Lake and spring waters.

Elliot			Simulating the source waters for the Wilkins Peak Member evaporite sequence with modern soda spring analogues	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Chemical sediments of the lacustrine Wilkins Peak Member of the Eocene Green River Formation potentially preserve detailed paleoclimate information relating to the conditions of their formation and preservation within the lake basin during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The Green River Formation comprises the world's largest sodium-carbonate evaporite deposit in the form of trona (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) in the Bridger Basin and nahcolite (NaHCO3) in the neighboring Piceance Creek Basin. Modern analogues suggest that these minerals necessitate the existence of an alkaline source water. Detrital provenance geochronometers suggest that the most likely source for volcanic waters to the Greater Green River Basin is the Colorado Mineral Belt, connected to the basin via the Aspen paleoriver.Here, we test the hypothesis that magmatic waters from the Colorado Mineral Belt could have supplied the Greater Green River Basin with the alkalinity needed to precipitate sodium-carbonate evaporites that are preserved in the Wilkins Peak Member by numerically simulating the evaporation of modern soda spring waters from northwestern Colorado at various temperature and atmospheric pCO2 conditions. The resulting simulated evaporite sequence is then compared to the mineralogy and textures preserved within the Wilkins Peak Member. Simulated evaporation of Steamboat Springs and Mineral Spring waters produce a close match to core observations and mineralogy. These simulations provide constraints on the salinities at which various minerals precipitated in the Wilkins Peak Member as well as insights into the regional temperature (>15 degrees C for gaylussite and trona; >27 degrees for pirssonite and trona) and pCO2 conditions (<1200 ppm for gaylussite and trona) during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum.					; Carroll, Alan/E-4546-2011	Arnuk, William/0000-0002-4133-8935; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				APR	2023	151								105597	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105597		FEB 2023											WOS:000965591200001
J	BENDELL, JF; ELLIOTT, PW				BENDELL, JF; ELLIOTT, PW			HABITAT SELECTION IN BLUE GROUSE	CONDOR												Blue Grouse (Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus) were shot and observed in very open and very dense cover on a portion of breeding range near Middle Quinsam Lake, Vancouver Island. New adult and yearling grouse selected the open type of vegetation. There was no evidence that grouse forced others from a preferred to a less-preferred type of cover. Within open cover, hooting males selected heights of land and established territories. Yearling males were attracted by territorial males. The attraction of yearlings to hooting males probably perpetuates the use of a territory. Lone hens were attracted by territorial males. Hens with brood moved over the breeding range independently of territorial males or their territories. Blue Grouse apparently select their habitat on the breeding range in spring and respond to the structure of the vegetation. The breeding habitat of blue grouse may be defined as open and dry, with shrubs and herbs interspersed with bare ground. The winter range is in montane forest, apparently in the parkland coniferous stands of the alpine, subalpine ecotone, and open ridges in subalpine forest. The habitat selection of blue grouse may help determine population. Habitat selection in this species may be partly explained by an evolutionary origin from prairie-dwelling grouse. They seem adapted to dry, open habitat in a number of ways. These include an innate response to open habitat, and aspects of behavior, color, form, and the economical use of water.																				1938-5129					1966	68	5					431	+		10.2307/1365316	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1365316													WOS:A19668344500001

Playa Lakes Region wetlands experience naturally fluctuating hydroperiods but are exposed to anthropogenic stresses, which are exacerbated during summer and may influence PLR wetland occupancy and selection by breeding shorebirds. We examined wetland-scale habitat use and nest-site selection of the 4 dominant shorebirds (American avocets [Recurvirostra americana], black-necked stilts [Himantopus mexicanus], killdeer [Charadrius vociferus], snowy plovers [C. alexandrinus]) nesting in playas, saline lakes, and in both created and riparian wetlands in the PLR of Texas, USA. All 4 species nested in saline lakes. Only avocets and killdeer nested in playas, and snowy plovers nested in riparian wetlands. No nests were found in created wetlands. Wetland habitat changed (P < 0.001) during the breeding season, while water habitats generally decreased. Used (i.e., shorebirds found nesting) Wetlands had more (P < 0.05) mudflats than non-used (i.e., shorebirds not found nesting) wetlands, which had more (P < 0.05) dry habitats. Used and non-used wetlands had similar (P > 0.05) amounts of water habitats. Nests were located close to vegetation on bare dry ground and dry ground with vegetation. Because water is ephemeral in PLR wetlands, shorebirds must select - in a somewhat predictive manner upon arrival - wetlands with suitable nest-site and brood-rearing habitat. Although surface water is necessary for nesting, its presence is not adequate for delineating suitable PLR wetland habitat for breeding shorebirds. Our findings that created wetlands cannot compensate for regional wetland losses in habitat or function highlights the need for conservation of natural PLR wetlands.

Fusing pollen-stratigraphic and dendroclimatic proxy data to reconstruct summer temperature variability during the past 7.5 ka in subarctic Fennoscandia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A new palaeoclimatic reconstruction of mid-summer (July) temperatures for the last 7.5 ka in northern Fennoscandia is presented. It is based on two botanical proxies: spectra of fossil pollen and tree rings of Scots pine logs recovered from lacustrine sediments in the Arctic tree-line region. A newly developed method of proxy fusion is used to integrate the proxy-specific reconstructions of past summer temperature variability based on the pollen-stratigraphic and dendroclimatic data. The rationale behind the method is that the two proxies are likely to be connected to climate variability in a timescale-dependent fashion and, accordingly, the new reconstruction makes use of the low- and high-frequencies from pollen-stratigraphic and tree-ring data, respectively. The most prominent features of the new reconstruction are: (1) the long-term decline of temperatures by 2.0 degrees C over the past 7.5 ka, (2) the mid-Holocene warmth culminating between 5 and 4 ka as a deviation from the cooling trend, (3) the Little Ice Age cool phase between 0.7 and 0.1 ka, and (4) the subsequent warming during the past century. These periods are superimposed on year-to-year variations in climate as dated to calendar-year accuracy by dendrochronology. Within the modern period, the years 1934 and 1937 are among the warmest, and the years 1903 and 1910 are among the coldest summers in the context of the past 7.5 ka. On average, the reconstructed Holocene climate was approximately 0.85 degrees C warmer than the twentieth century.					Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Birks, H.

Radiocarbon incorporation and size-selective filtration was used to trace total production and its distribution among particulate and dissolved pools. On average, 1-h exposures produced half the UVB-dependent inhibition of total production realized in 8-h exposures, indicating rapid kinetics of photoinhibition. Cumulative UVB-dependent photoinhibition averaged 36% in 8-h simulated surface exposures. The efficiency of photoinhibition was greater for N-deficient than N-replete communities, but was not related to phytoplankton light history, P limitation, or the dominant genera. The proportion of recently fixed carbon occurring in the dissolved pool after 8-h exposures was significantly greater in higher-UVB treatments, whereas the share in picoplankton (<2 mum) was significantly lower. Significant UVB-dependent inhibition of total production was limited on average to relatively severe exposures, but the rapid kinetics of inhibition and the apparent effects on the allocation of carbon suggest it may be important to the lake's food web. Differences in optical properties and thermal stratification patterns suggested that the relatively turbid west basin was potentially more susceptible to UVR photoinhibition than the more transparent east or central basins.

It often forms a continuous geological disaster chain. In this study, the topographical features and debris flow deposits in the Peilong valley were investigated in November 2018. It was found that the geological conditions in the valley are complex and numerous unstable sources are existed. Field investigations, laboratory tests, and a geomorphological analysis were conducted to obtain relevant data for the valley. And comparison of Landsat images indicates that the rate of change of the glacial area is 51.62% from winter to summer. Discrete element software (PFC3D) is used to simulate glacial landslides on the left bank. The simulation results show that a dam with a height of 141 m was formed, creating a lake. The debris flow after the dam break is simulated for different peak discharge values and durations based on a free surface shallow flow (SFLOW) model, with a final accumulation depth of 21.6 m. The comprehensive results of numerical simulation show that the chain of geological disasters induced by glacial landslide poses a huge threat to residents and roads near Peilong valley. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the glacier activities in real time to enable forecasting of debris flows and reduce the property losses and prevent loss of life.					; LI, Yuchao/I-5247-2013	ZHAI, SHIJIE/0009-0009-5798-7276; 													1435-9529	1435-9537				APR	2021	80	4					3405	3422		10.1007/s10064-021-02109-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-021-02109-5		JAN 2021											WOS:000612266600001

Spatial structure of a diving duck (Aythya, Oxyura) guild:: how does habitat structure and competition influence diving duck habitat use within northern prairie wetlands?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												What circumstances allow the coexistence of similar species is a common but complex question in community ecology. It is often assumed that sympatric species within the same guild must employ some mechanism of niche diversification to coexist. Diving duck (Anatidae: Aythya Boie, 1822 and Oxyura Bonaparte, 1828) competition is poorly understood and current evidence of coexistence mechanisms is contradictory. In the spring and summer of 2001 and 2002, we tested whether diving ducks foraging within prairie potholes segregate by depth to avoid competition. We sought to explain any segregation by sampling sediment particle size, compactness, and organic content; submergent vegetation; and benthic invertebrate densities in the foraging locations of each species. Our study was conducted at the wetland scale in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. We found that Redheads (Aythya americana (Eyton, 1838)), Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)), Canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria (Wilson, 1814)), and Ring-necked Ducks (Aythya collaris (Donovan, 1809)) foraged most often at shallow depths (50-100 cm), while Lesser Scaups (Aythya affinis (Eyton, 1838)) foraged at shallow to intermediate depths (50-150 cm). Thus, most divers did not segregate by depth. These results conflict with an earlier study that reported diving ducks segregated by depth to avoid competition. Diving ducks likely forage where prey abundance is greatest relative to the cost of diving to obtain that prey.																			0008-4301					SEP	2006	84	9					1358	1367		10.1139/Z06-121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z06-121													WOS:000242211200017
J	Chrzanowski, TH; Grover, JP				Chrzanowski, TH; Grover, JP			Effects of mineral nutrients on the growth of bacterio- and phytoplankton in two southern reservoirs	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nutrient limitation of bacterio- and phytoplankton was studied simultaneously in two warm-water lakes in the southern United States-Joe Pool Lake JPL) and Eagle Mountain Lake (EML). Lakes were sampled approximately biweekly between March 1998 and December 1999 from a single station. Nutrient limitation was assessed through dilution bioassays in which nitrogen (N, 50 muM above ambient), phosphorus (P, 10 muM above ambient), carbon (C, bacterioplankton only, 83 muM above ambient), and trace nutrients (Tm, phytoplankton only) were supplied. In both lakes, growth of bacterio- and phytoplankton was stimulated by nutrient additions. Multiple nutrient Limitation was common. P alone and in combination with N and C or Tm most frequently limited growth of both bacterio and phytoplankton in JPL. N alone and in combination with P and C or Tra most frequently Limited growth of both bacterio- and phytoplankton in EML. Comparison of in situ growth rates to growth rates under potentially nutrient saturating conditions revealed that both bacterio- and phytoplankton in both lakes were growing well below maximum potential during warm months but near maximum potential during cooler months. This result was due to a combined effect of low temperature in winter and restricted nutrient availability in summer. Phytoplankton was generally more strongly limited by nutrient availability than was bacterioplankton, but there were occasions when the intensity of limitation shifted between communities.

J	Korhola, A; Tikkanen, M; Weckström, J				Korhola, A; Tikkanen, M; Weckström, J			Quantification of Holocene lake-level changes in Finnish Lapland using a cladocera -: lake depth transfer model	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												During recent years, numerous studies dealing with Holocene lake level fluctuations have been conducted in Finnish Lapland. However, no quantification of lake level variations exists to date. Here, we applied a recently developed modern cladocera - lake depth transfer model to subfossil cladocerans analysed from three small and shallow (< 6 m) kettle-hole lakes in northwestern Finnish Lapland to provide estimates of the amplitudes of long-term lake-level changes in the region. The quantitative inferences were compared to pollen, charcoal and geochemical records from one of the study sites. The lake levels were inferred to be high during the early Holocene; they faced marked reduction up to 4-6 m in the mid-Holocene (approximate to 7000-4000 cal yr BP), and rose again during the latter part of the Holocene. There is some indication of lowered lake levels around 1500 cal yr BP, but interpretation of such small-scale changes is hazardous due to large prediction errors in the initial cladoceran model. The overall pattern of the Holocene lake level variation generally followed the regional changes in climate humidity as reconstructed in previous studies by means of other sedimentary proxy indicators, such as pollen and oxygen isotopic compositions. We postulate that changes in winter precipitation may have had a greater influence on lake-levels than variations in summer precipitation or evaporation.

The inhomogeneous distribution of pollutant matters near Tongling city due to river-land breeze is also investigated. Our results show the following conclusions. 1) The river breeze during the daytime is stronger than the land breeze at night. And the speed of river-land breeze is increased rapidly from 7:00 and arrived at the maximum at 12:00. After 15:00, the speed is slowed rapidly. 2) The river-land breeze in city area (east of Yangtze River, speed is .07 m/s) is weaker than the natural area (west of Yangtze River, speed is 0.18 m/s). Furthermore, the seasonal variations of breeze both in the west and east sides are different. In west side, the breeze is strongest in spring. And in the east side, the breeze is strongest in summer. 3) Under a weak breeze (<= 0.45 m/s), the PM10 is moved by the breeze within the region and causes the heterogeneity. While with a strong breeze (> 0.45 m/s), the PM10 is transported out of the region, and the PM10 concentration becomes homogenous. 4) The river breeze leads to a reduction of the pollutant concentration near the Yangtze River, but an increase in the city due to the transportation of pollutant particles from coast to city at daytime.					liang, YU/IYT-4334-2023	liang, YU/0009-0007-3922-3454														2296-6463				JAN 4	2023	10								1073885	10.3389/feart.2022.1073885	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.1073885													WOS:000914923600001

Freeze-thaw dynamics and the implications for stratification and brine geochemistry in meltwater ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												A high resolution record of water column temperatures was measured in a coastal meltwater pond on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The maximum temperature gradient measured through the water column was 35 degrees C, with an annual temperature range of 52.1 degrees C within the pond. For most of the year the pond shows reverse temperature stratification with the lowest temperatures measured at the surface of the pond, with the exception of brief periods of normal stratification over winter caused by regional wan-ning events. During freezing, the freezing front propagated downwards from the pond surface, excluding major ions and releasing large amounts of latent heat, both of which had a dramatic effect on the thermal and compositional evolution of the pond. Thawing is dominated by changes in surface air temperatures and the differential absorption of solar radiation. A new conceptual model of the physical freeze-thaw process has been developed that explains the presence of an 'ice plug' during melting, which reduces wind-induced mixing, forms a physical barrier to chemical processes, and encourages thermal and chemical stratification. It may also explain the persistence of anoxic and hydrogen sulphide bearing basal brines in summer stratified ponds that are otherwise fully oxidized.

Recent studies have found that Picocystis occasionally replaces the dominant: cyanobacterium (Arthrospira fusiformis), which is the main:food resource of Lesser Flamingos, in soda lakes of Bogoria and Nakuru. This article discusses the consequences of a high abundance (maximum cell numbers of > 3 billion cells 1(-1)) of Picocystis on food chains of African saline waters. During the study, we found a new morphotype of Picocystis characterized, by larger cell sizes and absence of lobes in hot springs near Lake Magadi. SSU rRNA genes of Picocystis strains and uncultured field clones collected from Lake Nakuru Were subjected to phylogenetic analyses together with other picoplankton from field and culture samples from saline, marine or freshwater. Picocystis salinarum from saline inland waters represents a link between marine and freshwater habitats from both an ecological and a phylogenetic point of view and is therefore of great interest.

J	Do, NT; Yoshimura, Y; Harada, M; Hiramatsu, K				Nguyen Thuy Do; Yoshimura, Yuichiro; Harada, Masayoshi; Hiramatsu, Kazuaki			Generation of hydrogen sulfide in the deepest part of a reservoir under anoxic water conditions	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												The generation of hydrogen sulfide in a reservoir can be characterized by a massive influx of organic matter, manifest thermal stratification, and an extreme anoxic state specifically at the hypolimnion layer in summer. It has been reported that in this deep layer of a thermally stratified water body, where dissolved oxygen is depleted and redox potential falls sharply below the value of zero, the prolonged oxygen-free period and negative redox potential may potentiate the production of toxic hydrogen sulfide. The main aim of this study was to simulate the varying concentration of hydrogen sulfide at the deepest part of the reservoir based on intensive monitoring of water quality parameters. A one-dimensional hydraulic ecosystem model was applied to simulate vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) continuously in time. Based on the simulated DO, the length of continuous oxygen-free state in the deepest layer was specified and then utilized to estimate the temporal changes of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) using a polynomial regression model. Finally, a linear regression model for hydrogen sulfide was fitted from the observed ORP, based on which, the temporal changes of hydrogen sulfide concentration were modeled using the simulated ORP. The introduction of several calculations gave good simulated results of hydrogen sulfide concentration, and this approach can be considered useful for predictive and explanatory purposes in further research investigating toxic hydrogen sulfide at the hypolimnion of the reservoir.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				JAN	2015	13	1					101	113		10.1007/s10333-013-0412-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-013-0412-0													WOS:000347290600011

The elevations of 175 m, 165 m and 155 m were located in the drawdown area and the non-flooded elevation of 180 m was taken as the control for the drawdown area. The drawdown area studied here acted as the sources of CH4 and N2O as a whole. Seasonal, inter-annual and spatial CH4, but not N2O, fluxes varied significantly between September 2010 and August 2012. The CH4 fluxes were highest in winter but lowest in summer, and significantly higher in the wet year than in the dry year. The annually cumulative CH4 emissions were 14.09 +/- 4.27, 12.61 +/- 3.59, 68.92 +/- 13.09 and 77.41 +/- 9.42 kg CH4 ha(-1) from the elevations of 180 m, 175 m, 165 m and 155 m, respectively. Compared with 180 m elevation, the annual CH4 emission was insignificantly decreased by 11% at 175 m elevation (P > 0.05), and substantially increased by 389% and 449% at 165 m (P < 0.05) and 155 m elevations (P < 0.05), respectively. The annually cumulative N2O emissions were 4.74 +/- 1.78, 7.43 +/- 2.57, 3.39 +/- 1.05 and 8.83 +/- 1.95 kg N2O ha(-1) from the above corresponding elevations, respectively, and there were no significant differences among the four elevations (P > 0.05). These results showed that CH4 emissions were increased but N2O emissions were not affected in the drawdown area after the dam impounding in the TGR, and CH4 emissions were increased with the decrease in the elevations while N2O emissions were not affected by the elevation in the drawdown area.

J	Sakata, M; Asakura, K				Sakata, Masahiro; Asakura, Kazuo			Evaluating relative contribution of atmospheric mercury species to mercury dry deposition in Japan	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In this study, we evaluated the relative contribution of atmospheric particulate mercury (Hg(p)) and divalent reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) to mercury dry deposition in Japan. The dry deposition fluxes (on a water surface sampler) and atmospheric PM concentrations of Hg, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and V, which were measured concurrently from April 2004 to March 2006 at 10 sites across the nation, were used in this evaluation. We considered that Hg(p) and RGM, but not Hg-0, are deposited on the water surface, and that our method of sampling Hg(p) without the use of KCl-coated annular denuders enables the exclusion of a significant amount of RGM artifact. The monthly average dry deposition velocities (= deposition flux/atmospheric PM concentration) of Cd and Pb were found to be similar to each other (Cd/Pb deposition velocities = 1.06 +/- 0.58). It was assumed that the deposition velocity of Hg(p) is identical to the mean deposition velocity of Cd and Pb, because the particle size distribution of Hg(p) is likely similar to those of both elements. Using this deposition velocity, the monthly dry deposition flux of Hg(p) was calculated. The average contribution (+/- 1 sigma) of Hg(p) to the annual deposition flux at ten sites was 26 +/- 15%. The mercury dry deposition flux increased generally from spring to early summer, which was attributed mostly to the deposition of RGM. This seasonal change correlated to that in photochemical oxidant (primarily O-3) concentration in air at most sites. These suggest that mercury dry deposition in Japan is predominantly deposition of RGM, which was formed via oxidation of Hg-0 by O-3 in the atmosphere.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2008	193	1-4					51	63		10.1007/s11270-008-9667-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9667-2													WOS:000257961200006

They all differ in their morphometry, hydrology and trophic state. Steady states were identified according to Sommer & Padisak(1993) when (i) 1, 2 or 3 species of algae contribute more than 80% of total biomass, (ii) their existence or coexistence persists for long enough (more than 1-2 weeks) and (iii) during that period the total biomass does not increase significantly. These situations were rare and were dominated by 7 stress-tolerant, colony-forming and ruderal disturbance-tolerant cyanoprokaryotes (Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis wesenbergii, Anabaena spiroides, Anabaenopsis arnoldii, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon gracile and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii). The equilibrium states had been registered only during hypertrophic conditions in three stressed and frequently disturbed shallow water bodies and were related to the summer-late summer season.

Faunal Remains from the Early Complexes of the Sagan-Zaba II Multilayered Habitation Site (9120-7880 cal. BP) in the Cis-Baikal: Planigraphy, Subsistence Patterns, and Seasonality	ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA												This article is the first publication to analyze faunal remains from early complexes (layers VII and VI) at the multilayer settlement of Sagan-Zaba II, situated on the western shore of Lake Baikal. We discuss species composition of fauna from the site as well as associated radiocarbon dates, age and sex designations, spatial distribution, and their overall selection as it relates to site seasonality. We address the previously-defined potential offset between uncalibrated dates from remains of ungulates and seals at the site, relating to the problem of "old" carbon in Lake Baikal. For layer VII, this offset is 682 years on average, and for layer VI it is 509 years. Taking the offset from nerpa bones into account, layers VII and VI now appear to date to the period between 9120 and 7880 cal BP. An analysis of faunal materials from the early complexes of the Sagan-Zaba II settlement indicates that inhabitants of this site hunted nerpa seals, ungulates, and other mammals as well as birds and fish, demonstrating a complex use of natural resources. Most likely, sites featured short-term, seasonal occupations, as indicated by the distribution of hearths and other materials, the thickness of hearth features, and the absence of specialized production areas. Results of an analysis of dentine layers from cross-sections of nerpa teeth as well as the presence of faunal bones that are only available during the hotter months of the year in the Cis-Baikal region, are consistent with a model of spring and summer site use.

J	Averyt, KB; Kim, JP; Hunter, KA				Averyt, KB; Kim, JP; Hunter, KA			Effect of pH on measurement of strong copper binding ligands in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the effect of pH on Cull binding by natural organic ligands in two New Zealand lakes on the South Island, New Zealand, using competitive ligand equilibration with salicylaldoxime and detection by cathodic stripping voltammetry. When the pH of a lake-water sample was adjusted to different values in the range 6.3-8.0, the conditional Cu2+ binding constant K" was found to increase, with a slope log K" versus pH of nearly +2, as would be expected for functional groups having a proton dissociation constant pK(a) > 9. In support of this, a comparison of log K" values measured on samples taken from surface and subsurface waters of two New Zealand alpine lakes over a 2-yr period showed a very similar log K"-pH dependence. These results imply that the functional group chemistry of strong Cu2+-binding ligands in such lakes is relatively uniform and may involve phenolic OH groups. In Lake Hayes, the Cu-binding ligand concentration [L](T) exceeded that of total dissolved Cu, [Cu](T) at almost all times of the year and all depths. However, in Lake Manapouri, little evidence of Cu-binding ligand was observed during late summer in the mixed layer, which suggests a seasonal cycle in Cu-binding ligands that is perhaps driven by enhanced ultraviolet irradiation in summer or by seasonal changes in phytoplankton community structure. This may have important consequences for the toxicity of Cu2+ to organisms in these lakes during summer.

Machine learning (ML) allows for high resolution modeling of the water table depth beyond the capabilities of conventional numerical physically-based hydrological models with respect to spatial resolution and overall accuracy. For this, in-situ well and proxy observations are used as training data in combination with high resolution covariates. The objective of this study is to model the depth of the uppermost water table for a typical summer and winter condition at 10 m spatial resolution over entire Denmark (43,000 km(2)). CatBoost, a state of the art implementation of gradient boosting decision trees, is employed in this study to model the water table depth and the associated uncertainties. The groundwater domain has not been the most prominent field of applications of recent hydrological ML advances due to the lack of big data. This study brings forward a novel knowledge-guided ML framework to overcome this limitation by integrating simulation results from a physically-based groundwater flow model. The simulation data are utilized to (1) identify wells that represent the uppermost water table, (2) augment missing training data by accounting for simulated water level seasonality, and (3) expand the list of covariates. The curated training dataset contains around 13,000 wells, 19,000 groundwater proxy observations at lakes, streams and coastline as well as 15 covariates. Cross validation attests that the ML model generalizes well with a mean absolute error of around 115 cm considering solely well observations and a MAE of <50 cm taking also the proxy observations into consideration. Quantile regression is applied to estimate confidence intervals and the estimated uncertainty is largest for moraine clay soils that are characterized with a distinct geological heterogeneity. This study highlights a novel research avenue of knowledge-guided ML for the groundwater domain by efficiently supporting a ML model with a physically-based hydrological model to predict the depth of the water table at unprecedented spatial detail and accuracy.					; troldborg, lars/G-8754-2018; Koch, Julian/D-2509-2015; Schneider, Raphael/H-7499-2018; Stisen, Simon/Q-2832-2017	Schneider, Raphael/0000-0001-9628-0809; Koch, Julian/0000-0002-7732-3436; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen/0000-0003-4821-5310; 														2624-9375				SEP 1	2021	3								701726	10.3389/frwa.2021.701726	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2021.701726													WOS:000696942300001

Effects of incentivized commercial harvest on Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: We sought to assess the effects of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus incentivized commercial harvest on seasonal survival from 2017 to 2021 and several additional demographic indices at 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Methods: We implemented a live-dead capture-mark-recapture study from 2017 to 2021 for Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo across seven natural, shallow lakes of northwestern Iowa to estimate annual recapture rates and survival related to estimated exploitation. We then compared Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo size distribution, condition, growth rate and maximum length, length at age 3, maximum observed age, and catch per unit effort to long-term harvest at 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Results: Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo summer survival was higher than winter survival that declined with increasing harvest after exploitation reached 15%; Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo relative abundance declined and Common Carp size structure increased, whereas Bigmouth Buffalo growth rates decreased, as harvest increased over 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Conclusions: While commercial harvest may represent additive mortality in short timescales and reduce relative abundance, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations showed resiliency in other demographic metrics of growth, age distribution, condition, and recruitment. Incentivized harvest did not achieve goals of reducing Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo abundance, and low estimated exploitation (i.e., <10%) led to compensatory mortality in both species. Consequently, higher harvest and supplemental population management is likely necessary to control Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations.

Biomarkers of algal populations in phytoplankton, filamentous algae, and sediments from the eastern basin of Lake Erie 2003-2005	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Algal carotenoids (n:16) and chlorophylls (n:7) were determined in phytoplankton (n:60), filamentous algae (n:14) and sediments (n:44), collected from two nearshore sites in eastern Lake Erie (Van Buren Point (VBP), 6.5 m; Point Gratiot (PG), 17 m), during summer and fall of 2003, 2004 and 2005. The most prominent biomarkers for diatoms (fucoxanthin), cryptophytes (alloxanthin), chlorophytes (chlorophyll-b) and cyanobacteria (zeaxanthin) revealed temporal variations in phytoplankton community composition, which were correlated to water temperatures: i) seasonal succession, from diatoms with some cryptophytes in June (cool), to an increased percentage of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria in August and September (warm); ii) differences between 2004 (cool; cryptophytes more abundant) and 2005 (warm; chlorophytes more abundant). Filamentous algae (chlorophytes, epiphytic diatoms; some cyanobacteria) varied in condition, according to levels of chl-a, pheopigments, and class biomarkers: high, at VBP (growing; decaying; bont/E suspect); low, at PG (mostly dead). Relative to phytoplankton, sediments were depleted in several biomarkers (chl-a; diadino-, neo- and violaxanthin) but enriched with others, particularly at PG (pheopigments; diatoxanthin; canthaxanthin, echinenone; alloxanthin). Sediment composition was characterized by strong differences between sites (chl-a, chl-b and fucoxanthin nearly 10-fold greater at VBP than PG) and increasing accumulation of biomarkers from year-to-year. A linear log-log function, relating total carotenoids to total chlorophylls (intercept -0.516, slope 1.054, r(2) 0.96), implied increased biodegradation among specimen types: levels of pigments (pmol/g ww) decreased three orders of magnitude, from phytoplankton, through filamentous algae, to sediments. Deviation from a 1:1 relationship indicated 1.7-fold depletion of carotenoids relative to chlorophylls at mid-range. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Based on 22 years of ERA5 data (2001-2022), a picture concerning the renewable energy resources in the Brates Lake area is provided. Comparing the wind and solar resources with in situ and satellite data, a relatively good agreement was found, especially in regards to the average values. In terms of wind speed conditions at a hub height of 100 m, we can expect a maximum value of 19.28 m/s during the winter time, while for the solar irradiance the energy level can reach up to 932 W/m2 during the summer season. Several generators of 2 MW were considered for evaluation, for which a state-of-the-art system of 6.2 MW was also added. The expected capacity factor of the turbines is in the range of (11.71-21.23)%, with better performances being expected from the Gamesa G90 generator. As a next step, several floating solar units were considered in order to simulate large-scale solar projects that may cover between 10 and 40% of the Brates Lake surface. The amount of the evaporated water saved by these solar panels was also considered, being estimated that the water demand of at least 3.42 km2 of the agricultural areas can be covered on an annual scale.

The portion of the Niagara River below the Falls and extending to Lake Ontario is known as the Niagara Gorge, Since 1848 many bridges of various styles have spanned the gorge below the Falls. The earliest structures were suspension bridges. These cable supported structures were gradually replaced with steel arches which proved to be the most compatible structural form for these environs. in April 1992, the ASCE designated the "Bridges of Niagara" an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. This paper summarizes the history and evolution of the bridges which have crossed this historic site and describes those currently in service to the international community.																					0-7844-0394-5				1998							154	160																WOS:000083192800024

Palaeoenvironmental Interpretation of Yedoma Silt (Ice Complex) Deposition as Cold-Climate Loess, Duvanny Yar, Northeast Siberia	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Uncertainty about the geological processes that deposited syngenetically frozen ice-rich silt (yedoma) across hundreds of thousands of square kilometres in central and northern Siberia fundamentally limits our understanding of the Pleistocene geology and palaeoecology of western Beringia, the sedimentary processes that led to sequestration of hundreds of Pg of carbon within permafrost and whether yedoma provides a globally significant record of ice-age atmospheric conditions or just regional floodplain activity. Here, we test the hypotheses of aeolian versus waterlain deposition of yedoma silt, elucidate the palaeoenvironmental conditions during deposition and develop a conceptual model of silt deposition to clarify understanding of yedoma formation in northern circumpolar regions during the Late Pleistocene. This is based on a field study in 2009 of the Russian stratotype of the 'Yedoma Suite', at Duvanny Yar, in the lower Kolyma River, northern Yakutia, supplemented by observations that we have collected there and at other sites in the Kolyma Lowland since the 1970s. We reconstruct a cold-climate loess region in northern Siberia that forms part of a vast Late Pleistocene permafrost zone extending from northwest Europe across northern Asia to northwest North America, and that was characterised by intense aeolian activity. Five litho-and cryostratigraphic units are identified in yedoma remnant 7E at Duvanny Yar, in ascending stratigraphic order: (1) massive silt, (2) peat, (3) stratified silt, (4) yedoma silt and (5) near-surface silt. The yedoma silt of unit 4 dominates the stratigraphy and is at least 34 m thick. It is characterised by horizontal to gently undulating subtle colour bands but typically lacks primary sedimentary stratification. Texturally, the yedoma silt has mean values of 65 +/- 7 per cent silt, 15 +/- 8 per cent sand and 21 +/- 4 per cent clay. Particle size distributions are bi- to polymodal, with a primary mode of about 41 mu m (coarse silt) and subsidiary modes are 0.3-0.7 mu m (very fine clay to fine clay), 3-5 mu m (coarse clay to very fine silt), 8-16 mu m (fine silt) and 150-350 mu m (fine sand to medium sand). Semidecomposed fine plant material is abundant and fine in-situ roots are pervasive. Syngenetic ice wedges, cryostructures and microcryostructures record syngenetic freezing of the silt. An age model for silt deposition is constructed from 47 pre-Holocene accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 ages, mostly from in-situ roots and from three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of quartz sand grains. The C-14 ages indicate that silt deposition extends from 19 000 +/- 300 cal BP to 50 000 cal BP or beyond. The OSL ages range from 21.2 +/- 1.9 ka near the top of the yedoma to 48.6 +/- 2.9 ka near the bottom, broadly consistent with the C-14 age model. Most of the yedoma silt in unit 4 at Duvanny Yar constitutes cryopedolith (sediment that has experienced incipient pedogenesis along with syngenetic freezing). Mineralised and humified organic remains dispersed within cryopedolith indicate incipient soil formation, but distinct soil horizons are absent. Five buried palaeosols and palaeosol 'complexes' are identified within cryopedolith on the basis of sedimentary and geochemical properties. Magnetic susceptibility, organic content, elemental concentrations and ratios tend to deviate from average values of these parameters at five levels in unit 4. The cryopedolith-palaeosol sequence accreted incrementally upwards on a vegetated palaeo-land surface with a relief of at least several metres, preserving syngenetic ground ice in the aggrading permafrost. Pollen spectra dated to between about 17 000 and 25 000 C-14 BP characteristically have frequencies of 20-60 per cent tree/shrub pollen (mainly Betula and Pinus) and 20-60 per cent graminoids, predominantly Poaceae, plus forbs, whereas spectra dated to about 30 000-33 000 C-14 BP have lower values of woody taxa (about 10%) and are dominated by graminoids (mainly Poaceae), forbs (particularly Caryophyllaceae and Asteraceae) and Selaginella rupestris. The latter are more typical of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples reported elsewhere in Siberia, and the unusually high arboreal pollen values in the LGM yedoma at Duvanny Yar are attributed to long-distance transport of pollen. Three hypotheses concerning the processes and environmental conditions of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar are tested. The alluvial-lacustrine hypothesis and the polygenetic hypothesis are both discounted on sedimentary, palaeoenvironmental, geocryological and palaeoecological grounds. The loessal hypothesis provides the only reasonable explanation to account for the bulk of the unit 4 yedoma silt at this site. Supporting the loessal interpretation are sedimentological and geocryological similarities between the Duvanny Yar loess-palaeosol sequence and cold-climate loesses in central and northern Alaska, the Klondike (Yukon), western and central Siberia and northwest Europe. Differences between loess at Duvanny Yar and that in western and central Siberia and northwest Europe include the persistence of permafrost and the abundance of ground ice and fine in-situ roots within the yedoma. Modern analogues of cold-climate loess deposition are envisaged at a local scale in cold, humid climates where local entrainment and deposition of loess are generally restricted to large alluvial valleys containing rivers that are glacially sourced or drain areas containing Late Pleistocene glacial deposits, and thus glacially ground silt. The Duvanny Yar yedoma shares sedimentological and geocryological features with yedoma interpreted as ice-rich loess or reworked loess facies at Itkillik (northern Alaska) and in the central Yakutian lowland, and with yedoma in the Laptev Sea region and the New Siberian Archipelago. It is therefore suggested that many lowland yedoma sections across Beringia are primarily of aeolian origin (or consist of reworked aeolian sediments), although other depositional processes (e.g. alluvial and colluvial) may account for some yedoma sequences in river valleys and mountains. A conceptual model of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar as cold-climate loess in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and MIS 2 envisages summer or autumn as the main season of loess deposition. In summer, the land surface was snow-free, unfrozen and relatively dry, making it vulnerable to deflation. Graminoids, forbs and biological soil crust communities trapped and stabilised windblown sediments. Loess accretion resulted from semicontinuous deposition of fine background particles and episodic, discrete dust storms that deposited coarse silt. Winter was characterised by deep thermal contraction cracking beneath thin and dusty snow covers, and snow and frozen ground restricted deflation and sediment trapping by dead grasses. Sources of loess at Duvanny Yar potentially include: (1) sediments and weathered bedrock on uplands to the east, south and southwest of the Kolyma Lowland; (2) alluvium deposited by rivers draining these uplands; and (3) sediments exposed in the Khallerchin tundra to the north and on the emergent continental shelf of the East Siberian Sea. Glacially sourced tributaries of the palaeo-Kolyma River contributed glacially ground silt into channel and/or floodplain deposits, and some of these were probably reworked by wind and deposited as loess in the Kolyma Lowland. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the sedimentary sequence at Duvanny Yar is traced from MIS 6 to the late Holocene. It includes thermokarst activity associated with alas lake development in the Kazantsevo interglacial (MIS 5e), loess accumulation, pedogenesis and syngenetic permafrost development, possibly commencing in the Zyryan glacial (70 000-55 000 cal BP) and extending through the Karginsky interstadial (55 000-25 000 cal BP) and Sartan glacial (25 000-15 000 cal BP), cessation of yedoma silt deposition during the Lateglacial, renewed thermokarst activity in the early Holocene, and permafrost aggradation in the mid to late Holocene. Beringian coastlands from northeast Yakutia through the north Alaskan Coastal Plain to the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (Canada) were characterised by extensive aeolian activity (deflation, loess, sand dunes, sand sheets, sand wedges) during MIS 2. Siberian and Canadian high-pressure cells coupled with a strengthened Aleutian low-pressure cell would have created enhanced pressure gradient-driven winds sufficient to entrain sediment on a regional scale. Summer winds are thought to have deflated sediment exposed on the East Siberian Sea shelf and deposited silt as a distal aeolian facies to the south. Additionally, stronger localised winds created by local downslope gravity flows (katabatic winds) may have entrained sediment. Local katabatic winds in summer may have transported silt generally northwards towards the Kolyma Lowland, particularly during times of extended upland glaciation in the North Anyuy Range to the east during the Zyryan (MIS 4) period, whereas winter winds carried limited amounts of silt generally southwards as a result of pressure gradient forces. The Duvanny Yar yedoma is part of a subcontinental-scale region of Late Pleistocene cold-climate loess. One end member, exemplified by the yedoma at Duvanny Yar, was loess rich in syngenetic ground ice (Beringian yedoma). The other, exemplified by loess in northwest Europe, was ice-poor and subject to complete permafrost degradation at the end of the last ice age. These end members reflect a distinction between enduring cold continuous permafrost conditions leading to stacked ice-rich transition zones and large syngenetic ice wedges in much of Beringia versus conditions oscillating between cold permafrost, warm permafrost and seasonal frost, leading to repeated permafrost thaw and small ice-wedge pseudomorphs in northwest Europe.

Samples were selected randomly and were taken from different regions of Hungary (Balaton Upland, Bukk Mountain, Somogy Hills, Mezofold, and Lake Heviz). Concentration (mBq L-1) of U-234, U-235, and U-238 in the waters varied from 1.1 to 685.2, from <0.3 to 7.9, and from 0.8 to 231.6 respectively. In general, the highest uranium concentrations were measured in spring waters, while the lowest were found in tap waters. In most cases radioactive disequilibrium was observed between uranium isotopes (U-234 and U-238). The activity ratio between U-234 and U-238 varies from 0.57 to 4.97. The calculated doses for the analyzed samples of spring water are in the range 0.07-32.39 mu Sv year(-1) with an average 4.32 mu Sv year(-1). This is well below the 100 mu Sv year(-1) reference level of the committed effective dose recommended by WHO and the EU Council. The other naturally occurring alpha emitting radionuclides (Ra-226 and Po-210) will be analyzed later to complete the dose assessment. This study provides preliminary information for consumers and authorities about their internal radiological exposure risk due to annual intake of uranium isotopes via water consumption.					; Kovacs, Tibor/IXD-1469-2023; KAVASI, Norbert/LVS-4571-2024; Kovacs, Tibor/H-1564-2017; Somlai, Janos/AAH-5222-2020	Somlai, Janos/0000-0002-5026-7948; Kovacs, Tibor/0000-0003-2606-0397; Jobbagy, Viktor/0000-0002-9416-2523													0236-5731	1588-2780				NOV	2010	286	2					417	422		10.1007/s10967-010-0711-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-010-0711-5													WOS:000285112200019

The overall sex ratio (female/male) was 1.03:1, not significantly different from the expected value 1:1. Nevertheless, sex ratio varied with seasons: 1.32:1 in the early stage of the spawning season (March-April), while 0.46:1 in the later stage (July-August). The monthly succession of the average gonadosomatic index (GSI) and percentages of mature individuals coindicated that T. swinhonis was a spring-summer (March-August) spawner. Further, the bimodal distribution of the size of eggs from one gravid ovary and histological analysis of mature gonads suggested that T. swinhonis was a multiple spawner with indeterminate fecundity and high degree of spawning asynchronicity. The sizes and ages at first maturity for females and males were 84.47 and 81.86 mm, and 1.62 and 1.56 yr, respectively. The batch fecundity (F-B) of this species varied in a wide range from 2006 to 73592 eggs per fish with a mean value of 26487.15 +/- 2675.61 (S.E.) eggs and increased with the increasing of the gonad weight (W-G), eviscerated weight (W-E), total length (L-T) and age (A). Overall, T. swinhonis in Biandantang (BDT) Lake is characterized by high fecundity and prolonged spawning season, resulting in easy population explosion. Thus, to remove T. swinhonis moderately or release predator fish discreetly to control its population is proposed considering its reproductive characteristics.

J	SEIP, DR				SEIP, DR			FACTORS LIMITING WOODLAND CARIBOU POPULATIONS AND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITH WOLVES AND MOOSE IN SOUTHEASTERN BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), wolves (Canis lupus), and moose (Alces alces) were radio-collared and monitored in two areas of southeastern British Columbia to determine predator-prey interactions. Throughout the year, wolves and moose used similar areas and habitats, and moose were the primary prey of wolves. In winter most caribou used high-elevation habitats and were spatially separated from wolves and moose living in valley bottoms. In summer, caribou, wolves, and moose at Quesnel Lake used similar areas and habitats, whereas in Wells Gray Park most caribou migrated to rugged, mountainous areas, which kept them spatially separated from wolves and moose. The Quesnel Lake caribou population had a high adult mortality rate (29%/year), wolf predation being the major cause. Calf survival to October was low (2.5/100 adult females) when wolves were present and uncontrolled in the area, but was significantly greater (39/100 adult females) when wolves were reduced or absent. The Quesnel Lake caribou population was found to be declining by about 25%/year, and wolf predation appeared to be the major limiting factor. Caribou in Wells Gray Park had a low adult mortality rate (8%/year) and comparatively high calf survival to October (37/100 adult females). The Wells Gray caribou population was found to be slowly increasing, apparently because its migratory behavior kept it separated from wolves and moose throughout the year, resulting in low wolf predation on the caribou.																			0008-4301					AUG	1992	70	8					1494	1503		10.1139/z92-206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z92-206													WOS:A1992JP72000004

Hatch timing of largemouth bass: implications for recruitment at the Northern edge of their native range	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Climate-related shifts in hatch timing could mean that age-0 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in north temperate lakes reach larger sizes and experience higher survival, which may contribute to increased prevalence of this species in many lakes. However, information on age-0 largemouth bass life history is lacking for these lakes. We estimated hatch dates, daily growth rates (DGR), and length-based probability of piscivory of age-0 largemouth bass in Wisconsin lakes to: (1) provide baseline data on early life history; (2) compare hatch timing between years with different spring temperature regimes, and (3) project how shifts in hatch timing might influence total length (TL) distributions of age-0 bass if mean DGR remained constant. Most age-0 largemouth bass (>90%) collected from ten Wisconsin lakes (N = 746) hatched between 23 May and 24 June during 2012 and 2013 and did not switch to piscivory during their first summer. Prevalence of positive correlations (16 of 24 lake-year pairings) between TL in and age indicates hatch timing may influence TLs attained by age-0 largemouth bass in August in some lake-years. Mean daily water temperatures in May 2012 were 3.1 degrees C warmer than in May 2013 for the five of the six lakes where hatch dates were estimated in both years. On average, earliest and median hatch dates for age-0 largemouth bass in these six lakes were 10-11 d earlier in 2012 than in 2013 and hatch duration was approximately 8 d longer in 2012. Despite differences in hatch timing, mean DGR was relatively consistent (range = 0.61-0.74 mm/d) between lakes and years. Simple simulations suggest that earlier hatch dates could result in more age-0 largemouth bass reaching TLs associated with piscivory and overwinter survival by the end of their first summer if growth rates did not change, which could translate to higher recruitment.

Both lakes have experienced a 40-60% decrease in peak summer zooplankton biomass following B. longimanus establishment around 2006-2007. In these lakes, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) are a key fishery species, and young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch are mainly planktivorous during their first summer. This led to concern that their growth could be detrimentally affected by the depletion of zooplankton forage. We used seining data to compare growth rates of YOY yellow perch before (2001-2005) and after (2008-2012) B. longimanus establishment in Rainy and Kabetogama lakes. Nearby Lake Vermilion, assumed to have been unaffected by B. longimanus during this time period, was used as a reference for natural variation in YOY growth in the region. YOY yellow perch length was modeled as a linear function of cumulative growing degree days (GDD) throughout the summer, and the slope of the relationship was compared between pre- and post-B. longimanus time periods for the three study lakes. The two lakes with B. longimanus showed similar decreases in YOY yellow perch growth rate relative to GDD, whereas Lake Vermilion showed no evidence of a decline in growth rates during this period. The reduction in growth rates resulted in an approximate 10% decrease in mean length of YOY yellow perch at the end of the summer after B. longimanus establishment, which could lead to further effects of this invasive zooplankter at higher trophic levels.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				JUL	2017	19	7					2197	2205		10.1007/s10530-017-1431-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1431-3													WOS:000404777100019

Atrazine and metolachlor were applied for weed control during spring of 1998-2002, 2005, and 2007-2013. Watershed-wide mass of applied herbicides ranged from 12.7 to 209.2 g atrazine and 10.9-302.2 g metolachlor with greatest application during 1998, 2009-2010 (atrazine) and 2007-2013 (metolachlor). Spring herbicide concentrations in Beasley Lake water ranged from below detection to 3.54 mu g atrazine/L and 3.01 mu g metolachlor/L. Multiple linear regression analyses with cropping patterns, BMPs, rainfall and time as independent variables, showed atrazine applications were associated with increases in cotton acreage and quail buffer, while metolachlor applications increased over time. Multiple linear regressions showed lake atrazine concentrations were associated with conservation tillage, rainfall, and corn, while lake metolachlor concentrations were associated with the cumulative metolachlor application and sediment retention pond installation.

Western Mediterranean hydro-climatic consequences of Holocene ice-rafted debris (Bond) events	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Gerard C. Bond established a Holocene series of North Atlantic ice-rafted debris events based on quartz and haematite-stained grains recovered from subpolar North Atlantic marine cores. These so-called "Bond events" document nine large-scale and multi-centennial North Atlantic cooling phases that might be linked to a reduced thermohaline circulation. Regardless of the high prominence of the Holocene North Atlantic ice-rafted debris record, there are critical scientific comments on the study: the Holocene Bond curve has not yet been replicated in other marine archives of the North Atlantic and there exist only very few palaeoclimatic studies that indicate all individual Bond events in their own record. Therefore, evidence of consistent hydro-climatic teleconnections between the subpolar North Atlantic and distant regions is not clear. In this context, the Western Mediterranean region presents key hydro-climatic sites for the reconstruction of a teleconnection with the subpolar North Atlantic. In particular, variability in Western Mediterranean winter precipitation might be the result of atmosphere-ocean coupled processes in the outer-tropical North Atlantic realm. Based on an improved Holocene delta O-18 record from Lake Sidi Ali (Middle Atlas, Morocco), we correlate Western Mediterranean precipitation anomalies with North Atlantic Bond events to identify a probable teleconnection between Western Mediterranean winter rains and subpolar North Atlantic cooling phases. Our data show a noticeable similarity between Western Mediterranean winter rain minima and Bond events during the Early Holocene and an opposite pattern during the Late Holocene. There is evidence of an enduring hydro-climatic change in the overall Atlantic atmosphere-ocean system and the response to external forcing during the Middle Holocene. Regarding a potential climatic anomaly around 4.2 ka (Bond event 3) in the Western Mediterranean, a centennial-scale winter rain maximum is generally in-phase with the overall pattern of alternating "wet and cool" and "dry and warm" intervals during the last 5000 years.

Numerous subaerial and subaqueous spring deposits are known from the geological record as a result of the occurrence of economic mineral deposits in, many of them. Some are reported to contain, fossils, but very few have been studied by paleobiologists; they represent an untapped source of paleobiological information on the history of hydrothermal ecosystems. Such systems are of special interest, given the molecular biological evidence that thermophilic bacteria Lie near the root of the tree of extant Life. The Drummond Basin sinters are very closely comparable with modern examples in Yellowstone National Path and elsewhere. Thirteen microfacies are recognisable in the field, ranging from high temperature apparently abiotic geyserite through various forms of stromatolitic sinter probably of cyanobacterial origin to ambient temperature marsh deposits. Microfossils in the stromatolites are interpreted as cyanobacterial sheaths. Herbaceous lycopsids occur in the lower temperature deposits.

The purpose of the seismic projects was to identify potential drilling targets for subsequent drilling programs, using explosives as a seismic source. Recent changes to fisheries regulations meant that blasting under lakes, the Mackenzie River and offshore from the delta, was not allowed to induce water overpressures in excess of 100 kPa in these water-bodies, and that a water overpressure monitoring program had to be conducted to confirm that this requirement was being met. This paper describes the water overpressure monitoring program on one of the exploration projects, presents the results of the monitoring, and discusses the challenges of carrying out this work in the middle of an arctic winter.																									2003							169	179																WOS:000223422800015

C; A. scopigera at 0, 5, 10 and 23.degree. C. A temperature of 12.degree. C was the threshold of postembryonic development of T. striatus from the 1st instar outside the egg sac to the 7th (adult) instar; the developmental zero of A. scopigera for the growth from the 1st-5th (adult) instar was between 0-4.degree. C. The thermal constant for the development of T. striatus was N 1220-1580 degree days (.degree. C .cntdot.d) for A. scopigera. The growth rate of laboratory and natural populations could be described by mean carapace width. The correlation of this parameter with the duration of development was linear for the initial and median phase of postembryogenesis. The natural populations of the 2 spiders in different habitats (coastal dunes, salt marsh, meadow at a lake) development at a different rate according to the mean ambient temperature (measured by the sucrose method). The development of T. striatus stopped by mid-Sept. at a critical day length of .apprx. 14 h. In most cases growth of natural populations was accelerated when compared with the slope of the regression lines for laboratory development. The thermal sum required for postembryonic development was lower in the field. High mortality of slowly developing small stages was the most important factor responsible for this acceleration. Pressure by predators and cannibalism probably brought about a raised relative survival rate of the rapidly developing individuals within the populations.																			0031-4056	1873-1511					1977	17	3					189	200																WOS:A1977DN55300004

Protozoa increased significantly in both number and biomass following fertilization, and community structure changed from dominance by oligotrichs prior to fertilization to dominance by the bacterivorous peritrich Epistylis rotans in the second and third years of fertilization. Rotifer abundance and biomass was not significantly different among summers, although one species, Conochilus natans that had not been seen previously, was present during the second and third year of fertilization. By the third year of fertilization both protozoan and rotifer biomass had declined from peak levels, while crustacean zooplankton nauplius abundance had increased suggesting the emergence of top-down regulatory controls as the lake became eutrophic.					; Bettez, Neil/I-5672-2012	Bettez, Neil/0000-0002-6859-8083; 													0018-8158					SEP 22	1995	312	3					183	190		10.1007/BF00015511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015511													WOS:A1995TL93600005

Inhibition of Trichormus variabilis and Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium Using Probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Water blooms are a serious environmental problem affecting fresh and marine ecosystem. Application of probiotic bacteria has been introduced as an emerging and eco-friendly tool to regulate or inhibit cyanobacterial blooms. In the present study, we have isolated and identified two different cyanobacterial isolates from El Manzala Lake. Afterward, we examined the anticyanobacterial activity to evaluate their effect on cyanobacterial morphology. Furthermore, the effect on cyanobacterial behavior was evaluated through determination of biomass, reduction percentage of both chlorophyll, phycocyanin using the co culture technique between the selected cyanobacterial isolates and probiotic bacteria (MT2, MT3 and MT4). In this study, the relative high occurrence of cyanobacteria was observed during spring and summer seasons. The isolated cyanobacteria were identified as Trichormus variabilis and Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium. Only, MT2 (Lactobacillius sakei) supernatant displayed anticyanobacterial activity with inhibition zone of 13.6 +/- 1.25 and 10 +/- 1.44 mm against Trichormus variabilis and Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium, isolated from El-Manzala Lake, respectively. Also, the same supernatant has caused in occurring great morphological changes represented by complete lysis of Trichormus variabilis filaments after 60 minutes. Strong decrease in some photosynthetic parameters in the co-culture between Lb. sakei and each of Trichormus variabilis and Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium, individually, was recorded. For Trichormus variabilis, after five days of incubation, the remarkable reduction percentage of chlorophyll and phycocyanin production was observed and reached 90.85 +/- 3.55% and 88.84 +/- 3.55%, respectively. In Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium co-culture, the reduction percentage reached 100 +/- 0.0 and 91.38 +/- 2.99% for chlorophyll and phycocyanin, individually.					bassem, samah/LZE-1563-2025; GUERRIERO, Giulia/M-1058-2019; Goda, Hanan/AGS-5381-2022														0449-2285	2357-0245				JAN	2021	64	1					201	210		10.21608/EJCHEM.2020.41997.2848	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/EJCHEM.2020.41997.2848													WOS:000613531400021

Part I: Distribution and movement of trout	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Summer temperature/dissolved oxygen squeeze conditions have negatively impacted coldwater fisheries, including rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), in North and South Twin lakes of northeastern Washington. In 2009, line diffuser hypolimnetic oxygenation (HO) was initiated in North Twin to prevent anoxia and increase summer trout habitat. Suitable trout habitat volume increased from a low of 0% preoxygenation to 100% of the North Twin hypolimnion following HO. To assess if trout utilized the expanded habitat following oxygenation, summer trout movements and habitat utilization were assessed from 2006 through 2012 using various combinations of ultrasonic telemetry, archival tags, gillnetting, and hydroacoustics. Trout utilized North Twin hypolimnetic habitat more frequently compared to pre-HO years and to unoxygenated South Twin, and swim speeds significantly decreased with oxygenation. Chaoborus zooplankton distributions have also changed following HO; water column densities were significantly lower with oxygenation compared to preoxygenation and to unoxygenated South Twin.					; Moore, Barry/AAB-6459-2020	Child, Andrew Wright/0000-0001-6666-0739; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2014	30	3					226	239		10.1080/10402381.2014.908437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2014.908437													WOS:000335942800002

(2010; Anti-phase oscillation of Asian monsoons during the Younger Dryas period: Evidence from peat cellulose delta C-13 of Hani, Northeast China, Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 297, 214-222) discuss bulk peat sample cellulose delta C-13 data from a fen in northeast China as a proxy for East Asian summer monsoon intensity during the Late Glacial period. Based on their own results, cited papers, and an extensive re-interpretation of sedimentological and palynological data from nearby Lake Sihailongwan, 'Hong et al. (2010) construct a hypothesis of contrasting moisture conditions in northern and southern China, with wet conditions in the north during the Younger Dryas period and an anti-phase behaviour of Indian- and East Asian summer monsoon intensity. However, we do not approve of the reinterpretation of our Lake Sihailongwan data by 'Hong et al. (2010) and must strongly reject it. We show here that neither the Hong et al. (2010) fen data, nor the Lake Sihailongwan data or any other cited data allow for the sound assumption of an intensified East Asian summer monsoon in northeastern China during the Younger Dryas. The Late Glacial variability of the fen data found by 'Hong et al. (2010) can be easily explained by changes in the plant assemblage down core and thus by the composition of the peat. Furthermore, the use of bulk peat cellulose delta C-13 data as a precipitation proxy remains unproven for that area. Hence, there is no basis for a model contrasting Indian and East Asian summer monsoons during that period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to determine distributional patterns of FIB and to assess their origin on several sites in spring area and in vertical profile of Proscansko Lake in Plitvice Lakes National Park. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted from March to January 2013 on 9 sampling sites. Standard microbiological methods were used to determine densities of total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococcus (FS), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PS) and Clostridium perfringens in water samples. Results and Conclusions: Source area sustained higher densities of FIB compared to Proscansko Lake, throughout the study period. Sampling site White River below the village had highest values of certain FIB, indicating Plitvicki Ljeskovac as main fecal pollution source. There were seasonal differences in TC and FC with July and October displaying increased densities, the latter probably due to heavy rainfall. The ratio FC/FS in July indicated contamination of mainly animal origin. At the sampling site of Matica River estuary in Proscansko Lake, an increased densities of TC and FC bacteria were observed compared to other sites and depths, possibly due to source streams influence and stratification conditions. This study showed that the indicator bacteria of fecal contamination in the spring area of the Plitvice Lakes National Park are present and their quantity and distribution patterns depend on season, weather conditions and different effects in water column of the lake.																			0031-5362					MAR	2016	118	1					37	44																WOS:000375587300005

Geochemistry and mineralogy were compared with diatom-inferred (Di-) 'date of autumn mixing' (A(mix)), DOC, pH, and selected indicator pollen species from the same sediment core. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a positive correlation between processes triggered by temperature and precipitation (e.g., lake mixing, DOC). PCA grouped indicators of physical weathering and enhanced catchment run-off (sand, quartz, feldspar), elements of weathering (e.g., Ti, Rb, Mn) under dryer conditions (clay to silt fractions), and elements that probably were related to changes in redox conditions (Cu, Fe, S, Zn). The duration and height of the snow-pack played an important role in this high-alpine environment, affecting weathering, erosion, pH, and lake stratification. Low Alnus viridis pollen abundance, together with markers for increased elements of erosion, indicated extensive snow-pack. Changes in S coupled with As, and elements indicating increased weathering, reflected climate oscillations. LOI was affected by productivity and erosion. High (late) Di-A(mix) coupled with increased Di-DOC indicated prolonged summers with increased productivity. Cold and wet (snow-rich) phases and subsequent melting caused low pH and a decoupling of the significant linear correlation between sedimentary Ca and Di-pH. Weathering and leaching during climate deteriorations opposed the long-term trend in a loss of cations and forced in-lake alkalinity generation during the following lake warming. Overall, the multi-proxy study indicated complex climate-driven processes within different time-scales (long-term trends, climate oscillations, seasonality). The climate oscillations within 12-5 ky BP corresponded well with the cool and wet phases known from central Europe suggesting a dominant common Atlantic climate impact. When Mediterranean climate established between 5 and 4 ky BP, its influence on the southern slopes of the Alps increased.

Here we focus on specific lakes called Sharp-Edged Depressions, which are surrounded by high-elevation terrains called ramparts with unique structural and spectral properties. We aim at understanding how topography and surface properties around the lakes affect air-surface interactions. To study the effect of ramparts, we utilize the mtWRF model configured in 2D. We model a variety of lake morphologies: those surrounded by hills (300 m high, 30 km wide), those with no surrounding topography, and those at the bottom of a depression. To encapsulate the effects of surface properties, we vary the surface roughness, albedo, and thermal inertia. We also consider the effect of varying the background wind and the season. Our model indicates that the addition of topography creates weaker winds over the lake (approximate to -30%) and reduces the quantity of methane evaporated (approximate to -10%) compared to the no-topography case. However, topography results in deeper vertical transport of methane and deepens the marine layer (from a few meters to approximate to 50 m). Higher roughness (from 0.4 to 40 cm) of the ramparts tends to decrease the wind speed (approximate to -50%) and reduces the horizontal extension of the lake breeze (approximate to -20%). Albedo and thermal inertia variations have a negligible effect. Seasons have a strong effect on the evaporation of methane, with evaporation rates nearly 3 times higher in summer than in winter.

J	Reid, NJ; Hamilton, SK				Reid, Nicole J.; Hamilton, Stephen K.			Controls on algal abundance in a eutrophic river with varying degrees of impoundment (Kalamazoo River, Michigan, USA)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study examined how nutrients and hydraulic flushing interact to regulate growth of phytoplankton in the Kalamazoo River (Michigan, USA), which has seven reservoirs with summer residence times ranging from < 1 to 12 days. The largest reservoir, Lake Allegan, suffers from eutrophication and resultant impairments of beneficial uses, problems being addressed by a TMDL focused on control of phosphorus. Water residence time was the most important control on algal growth in the various impoundments, including Lake Allegan, where residence time remained < 12 days through the summer. Based on longitudinal surveys, free-flowing river reaches appeared to remove phytoplankton, whereas a series of old decommissioned dams above Lake Allegan evidently contributed to algal biomass accumulation in the river. Nutrient concentrations were generally high throughout the river system; thus, algal growth may not be nutrient-limited at present. Phytoplankton in the two largest reservoirs was dominated by diatoms and green algae during late summer, despite nutrient concentrations that would tend to favor cyanobacteria in lakes. The relative availability of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and silicon (Si) can indicate how algal growth may respond if nutrient concentrations were to decrease in the future. Nutrient ratios suggest that N and Si could be important in addition to P, depending on the reservoir and the season. In reservoirs with short water residence times, strategies to control eutrophication by reducing phosphorus loading may not yield results as readily as they do in lakes; hydraulic flushing, other nutrients, and upstream impoundments must also be considered.

J	He, W; Choi, I; Lee, JJ; Hur, J				He, Wei; Choi, Ilhwan; Lee, Jung-Joon; Hur, Jin			Coupling effects of abiotic and biotic factors on molecular composition of dissolved organic matter in a freshwater wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, temporal and spatial variations in five defined molecular size fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were examined for a well preserved wetland (Upo Wetland) and its surrounding areas, and the influencing factors were explored with many biotic and abioic parameters. For each DOM sample, the five size fractions were determined by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detector (SEC-OCD). For 2-year long monthly monitoring, bio-polymers (BP), humic substances (HS), building blocks (BB), low molecular-weight (LMW) neutrals, and LMW acids displayed the median values of 264, 1884, 1070, 1090, and 11 mu g-C L-1, respectively, accounting for 6.2%, 41.7%, 24.5%, 26.4%, and 0.4% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The dominant presence of HS indicated that terrestrial input played important roles in DOM composition of the freshwater ecosystem, which contrasted with coastal wetlands in other reports. Both seasonal and periodic patterns in the variations were found only for HS and BB among the size fractions. It was also notable that the sources of HS were seasonally shifted from aquagenic origin in winter to pedogenic origin in summer. The correlations among the size fractions revealed that BB and LMW neutrals might be degradation products from HS and humic-like substances (HS + BB), respectively, while LMW acids, from LMW neutrals. Principle component analysis revealed that the humic-like substances and the aromaticity of DOM were associated with temperature, chlorophyll a, phosphorous, and rainfall, whereas the other fractions and the molecular weight of HS were primarily affected by solar irradiation. Significant correlations between DOM composition and some biotic factors further suggested that DOM may even affect the biological communities, which provides an insight into the potential coupling effects of biotic and abiotic factors on DOM molecular composition in freshwater wetlands.

Studying their tephra falls may reveal conduit dynamics, eruption source parameters and fragmentation mechanisms. Villarrica Volcano (Southern Andes of Chile) has sustained persistent open conduit activity, associated with a dynamic lava lake since at least 1984-85. Increased seismicity and degassing in August 2014 were followed by Strombolian activity starting in February 2015 and culminated with a 1.5 km-high lava fountain on 3 March 2015. This eruption produced tephra fallout, spatter agglutination, clastogenic lavas and mixed avalanche deposits. Here we characterized for first time Villarrica's 3 March 2015 tephra fall deposits produced by lava fountain and its rapid transition to sustained eruption column, providing valuable information on paroxysmal activity in open conduit volcanoes. Tephra was dispersed southeast of the crater in a narrow, elongated, nearly-elliptic area. Minimum observed tephra loading was estimated to be 80-120 g/m(2) at crosswind locations, while maximum load estimation was about 11,500 g/m(2), at 7-9 km distance from the vent. At 6-8 km downwind, the tephra fall deposit consisted of a single black scoria layer; fall varied from a lapilli blanket at medial distances (9-19 km) to a few individual particles at distal sites (20-43 km). All samples are vitrophyric and contain plagioclase (3-30%), clinopyroxene (2-5%), olivine (1-4%) and orthopyroxene (<1%) phenocrysts. We estimate that 1.4 x 10(9) kg, equivalent to similar to 2.4 x 10(6) m(3) of basaltic andesite tephra (52.7-54.7 SiO2 wt. %), were erupted within a period of about 16 min at a mass eruption rate of similar to 1.5 x 10(6) kg/s. The sustained eruption column height was estimated at similar to 10.8 km, with magnitude and intensity of 2.11 and 9.13 respectively. We propose that a rejuvenated, volatile-rich magmatic intrusion probably triggered paroxysmal activity. The Villarrica eruption is classified as a short-lived, large-scale lava fountain, similar to analogous historical events at Mt. Etna and Kilauea. As evident by devastating twentieth century Villarrica eruptions which also developed similar lava fountains, this eruption style should be considered as frequent and a potential source of volcanic hazard in the future.

In this study, we present a well-dated, ca. 4.0 ka grain-size sensitive component record from Lake MangCo, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The record depicts late Holocene ISM evolution and centennial-scale precipitation events superimposed on millennial-scale climate changes. The results indicate that precipitation was relatively high during the first half of the late Holocene, likely before 2.0 cal ka BP, followed by a period of relatively reduced precipitation thereafter, which indicates that the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI) has primarily controlled ISM intensity. A slight increasing trend in ISM strength since 1.1 cal ka BP was observed, which may correspond to the reported "2.0-kyr-shift" and could be related to warming tropical temperatures. Three low precipitation intervals, occurring at similar to 1.1, 2.0, and 3.2 cal ka BP, align well with known centennial-scale ISM weakening events during the late Holocene, such as the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the "2.0-ka-dry-event." Our findings further validate the climatic effects of tropical ocean-atmospheric interactions in the Pacific and Indian Ocean basins on ISM variabilities at centennial timescales.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022															2296-6463				FEB 24	2025	13								1554436	10.3389/feart.2025.1554436	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2025.1554436													WOS:001440248900001

Association between submerged aquatic vegetation and elevated levels of Escherichia coli and potential bacterial pathogens in freshwater lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli have been reported to persist and potentially grow in a wide variety of secondary habitats, such as water, beach sand, sediment, periphyton and some algae. However, little is known about their association with submerged macrophytes and how this may influence water quality. In this study, we examined the association of E. coli and potential bacterial pathogens with Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM), an invasive, submerged, macrophyte that has spread across thousands of lakes in North America. EWM samples were collected from 10 lakes in Minnesota, once a month, for six consecutive months from early summer to late fall Microbiota associated with EWM were examined using membrane filtration, quantitative PCR targeting various bacterial pathogens and host-associated marker genes, and high-throughput DNA sequencing. E. cofi densities were generally elevated on EWM samples, and peaked during warmer months. Moreover, our results showed that EWM could serve as a temporal source for transmission of microbiota to the water column. Several potential pathogenic groups, including Aeromonos, En terobacteriaceae, and Clostridium were present in significantly greater relative abundance on EWM than in water, and waterfowl was predicted to be the major source of fecal contamination. These findings have water quality implications with respect to the potential for submerged macrophytes to harbor and disperse E. coil and other bacterial pathogens in a large number of waterbodies.

Exploratory analysis of the winter chemistry of five lakes on the North Slope of Alaska	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Lakes are important water resources on the North Slope of Alaska. Freshwater is required for oilfield production as well as exploration, which occurs largely on ice roads and pads. Since most North Slope lakes are shallow, the quantity and quality of the water under ice at the end of winter are important environmental management issues. Currently, water-use permits are a function of the presence of overwintering fish populations, and their sensitivity to low oxygen concentrations. Sampling of five North Slope lakes during the winter of 2004-2005 shed some light on the winter chemistry of four lakes that were used as water supplies and one undisturbed lake. Field analysis was conducted for oxygen, conductivity, pH, and temperature throughout the lake depth, as well as ice thickness and water depth. Water samples were retrieved from the lakes and analyzed for Na, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, dissolved-organic carbon, and alkalinity in the laboratory. Lake properties, rather than pumping, were the best predictors of oxygen depletion, with the highest dissolved-oxygen levels maintained in the lake with the lowest concentration of constituents. Volume weighted mean dissolved-oxygen concentrations ranged from 4 to 94% of saturation in March. Dissolved oxygen and specific conductance data suggested that the lakes began to refresh in May.

J	Kettle, H; Thompson, R; Anderson, NJ; Livingstone, DM				Kettle, H; Thompson, R; Anderson, NJ; Livingstone, DM			Empirical modeling of summer lake surface temperatures in southwest Greenland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This work presents a method to estimate mean daily lake surface water temperatures using only air temperature, theoretical clear-sky solar radiation, and lake size. Surface water temperatures were measured at a selection of lakes in southwest Greenland during the summers of 1998-2000. The lakes are small (surface area <150 ha) with maximum depths ranging from 3.5 to 47 m. An empirical model requiring only local air temperature and theoretical clear-sky solar radiation is developed to predict daily mean lake surface temperatures in summer for each lake. The model approximates the slow integrated response of water temperature to meteorological forcing by applying an exponential smoothing filter to air temperature. Exponential smoothing results in a 35% improvement in model fit compared with a model using unsmoothed air temperatures. The smoothed air temperatures and clear-sky solar radiation are linearly combined to estimate the daily mean lake surface temperatures. The smoothing parameters and the three linear coefficients of the model, obtained individually for each of 15 lakes, are found to relate to lake area and maximum depth, leading to the development of a general model. With this general model it is possible to predict the summer surface temperatures at any lake in this region where local air temperatures can be estimated. Cross-validation of the general model at each lake in turn indicated a 90% forecast skill and average standard error of prediction of 1.0degreesC. Examination of the daily prediction errors over time suggests a relation to strong wind events.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2004	49	1					271	282		10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0271	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0271													WOS:000188381100029

Stratification strength and light climate explain variation in chlorophyll a at the continental scale in a European multilake survey in a heatwave summer	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To determine the drivers of phytoplankton biomass, we collected standardized morphometric, physical, and biological data in 230 lakes across the Mediterranean, Continental, and Boreal climatic zones of the European continent. Multilinear regression models tested on this snapshot of mostly eutrophic lakes (median total phosphorus [TP] = 0.06 and total nitrogen [TN] = 0.7 mg L-1), and its subsets (2 depth types and 3 climatic zones), show that light climate and stratification strength were the most significant explanatory variables for chlorophyll a (Chl a) variance. TN was a significant predictor for phytoplankton biomass for shallow and continental lakes, while TP never appeared as an explanatory variable, suggesting that under high TP, light, which partially controls stratification strength, becomes limiting for phytoplankton development. Mediterranean lakes were the warmest yet most weakly stratified and had significantly less Chl a than Boreal lakes, where the temperature anomaly from the long-term average, during a summer heatwave was the highest (+4 degrees C) and showed a significant, exponential relationship with stratification strength. This European survey represents a summer snapshot of phytoplankton biomass and its drivers, and lends support that light and stratification metrics, which are both affected by climate change, are better predictors for phytoplankton biomass in nutrient-rich lakes than nutrient concentrations and surface temperature.

J	Lepori, F; Pozzoni, M; Pera, S				Lepori, F.; Pozzoni, M.; Pera, S.			What Drives Warming Trends in Streams? A Case Study from the Alpine Foothills	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												We investigated the effects of climate warming and land-use changes on the temperature and discharge of seven Swiss and Italian streams in the catchment of Lake Lugano. In addition, we attempted to predict future stream conditions based on regional climate scenarios. Between 1976 and 2012, the study streams warmed by 1.5-4.3 degrees C, whereas discharge showed no long-term trends. Warming trends were driven mainly by catchment urbanization and two large-scale climatic oscillations, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. In comparison, independent influences by radiative forcing due to increased atmospheric CO2 were uncertain. However, radiative forcing was predicted to further increase stream temperature (to +3-7 degrees C), reduce summer discharge (to -46%) and increase winter discharge (to +96%) between the present and 2070-2099. These results provide new insights into the drivers of long-term temperature and discharge trends in European streams subject to multiple impacts. The picture emerging is one of transition, where greenhouse-gas forcing is gaining ground over climate oscillations and urbanization, the drivers of past trends. This shift would impress a more directional nature upon future changes in stream temperature and discharge, and extend anthropogenic warming to rural streams. Diffusing future impacts on stream ecosystems would require adaptation measures at local to national scales and mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions at the global scale.

J	Kaevats, L; Sprules, WG; Shuter, BJ				Kaevats, L; Sprules, WG; Shuter, BJ			Effects of wind-induced spatial variation in water temperature and zooplankton concentration on the growth of young-of-the-year smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Young-of-the-year (YOY) smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, spend their first summer in littoral areas near their nests. Evidence indicates that nests of smallmouth bass in Lake Opeongo, Ontario, Canada are more abundant in downwind locations than in upwind areas. We hypothesize that wind-induced lower water temperatures and food availability in upwind nesting areas lead to lower growth rates of YOY bass in upwind than in downwind nesting areas. We show that water temperatures were 0.6-1.3 degrees C higher in downwind than upwind littoral areas during the period from mid-June to mid-July, when the YOY bass were on or near their nests. Although quite variable, zooplankton concentrations were also higher at downwind sites. In addition, bioenergetic simulations based on time series of field-measured temperatures predicted higher growth rates of YOY bass in the downwind sites. Growth rates based on sequential sampling of bass fry from their nests did not, however, differ statistically between upwind and downwind sites, although fry consistently weighed more downwind than upwind in the basin with the longer fetch possibly due to earlier spring warming. Our hypothesis is thus only partially supported and we call for further research on effects of spatial gradients on smallmouth bass life history.

J	Svendsen, JI; Mangerud, J				Svendsen, John Inge; Mangerud, Jan			Paleoclimatic inferences from glacial fluctuations on Svalbard during the last 20 000 years	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The climate history of western Spitsbergen, Svalbard is deduced from variations of glaciers during the last 20 000 years. A major depression of the regional equilibrium line altitude (ELA) occurred during the Late Weichselian glacial maximum (18000-13000 y ago) when low summer temperatures may have caused year-round snow accumulation on the ground. This rapid expansion of the glaciers also indicates nearby moisture sources, suggesting partly open conditions in the Norwegian Sea during the summers. A rapid glacial retreat around 13 000-12 500 y BP was caused by a sudden warming. During the Younger Dryas the ELA along the extreme western coast of Spitsbergen was not significantly lower than at present. In contrast to Fennoscandia, the British Isles and the Alps, there is no evidence for readvance of local glaciers during Younger Dryas on western Spitsbergen. This difference is attributed to a much dryer climate on Spitsbergen and probably only slight changes in sea surface temperatures. In addition, summer melting in this high arctic area is more sensitive to orbitally increased insolation. Around 10 000 y BP another rapid warming occurred and during early and mid Holocene the summer temperatures were significantly higher than at present. A temperature decline during the late Holocene caused regrowth of the glaciers which reached their maximum Holocene position during the last century.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	1992	6	3-4					213	220																WOS:000207079600011
J	Budziak, D; Carasek, E				Budziak, Dilma; Carasek, Eduardo			Determination of Trihalomethanes in drinking water from three different water sources in Florianopolis-Brazil using purge and trap and gas chromatography	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The water source to feed the public water system in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina State-Brazil is very diversified and it was used to investigate the formation of trihalomethanes (THM). A strong relationship between the presence of THM and the kind of water source was found. Water sources in contact with vegetation contained higher concentration of total trihalomethanes (TTHM). Water samples from the Cubatao-Piloes system had a mean TTHM value of 59.9 Pa L-1 while in Peri Lake, the mean TTHM was 152.3 mu g L-1. Samples from the North Shore system, based on wellsprings, had a mean TYHM of 19.4 mu g L-1. In the case of natural waters (spring water and wellsprings) THM was not observed. A system that combines purge-and-trap and gas chromatography with an electron capture detector was used in this study. After careful choice of the experimental conditions, the performance of the system was evaluated. Relative standard deviation, limit of detection and limit of quantification are 8-17 %, 0.01-0.03 mu g L-1 and 0.03-0.08 mu g L-1 respectively. Linear range falls within the range 0.1 to 8.0 mu g L-1 for all compounds. Precision ranged between 91.3 and 126.0%.

The focal question was to identify the type and biological origin of proteins in DOM, and to describe diversity of protein origin at the level of higher taxonomic units, as well as to detect extracellular enzymes possibly important in the carbon cycle. Identified proteins were classified according to their phylogenetic origin and metabolic function using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein and taxonomy database. Seventy-eight percent of the proteins in DOM from the lake but less than 50% in forest soil DOM originated from bacteria. In a deciduous forest, the number of identified proteins decreased from 75 to 28 with increasing soil depth and decreasing total soil organic carbon content. The number of identified proteins and taxonomic groups was 50% higher in winter than in summer. In spruce forest, number of proteins and taxonomic groups decreased by 50% on a plot where trees had been girdled a year before and carbohydrate transport to roots was terminated. After girdling, proteins from four taxonomic groups remained as compared to nine taxonomic groups in healthy forest. Enzymes involved in degradation of organic matter were not identified in free soil DOM. However, cellulases and laccases were found among proteins extracted from soil particles, indicating that degradation of soil organic matter takes place in biofilms on particle surfaces. These results demonstrate a novel application of proteomics to obtain a "proteomic fingerprint'' of presence and activity of organisms in an ecosystem.

Subfossil chironomid and pollen assemblages in a sediment core from a peatland located south of Lake Neor enabled identification of four main hydrologic phases. The period 15,500-12,700 cal yr BP was characterized by a relatively dry climate with an open landscape, suggested by the abundance of Irano-Turanian steppe plants (e.g. Amaranthaceae, Artemisia and Cousinia). Dominance of several shallow-water and semi-terrestrial chironomid taxa (e.g. Pseudosmittia, Smittia/Parasmittia and Paraphaenocladius/Parametriocnemus) during this period is indicative of lower water tables in the wetland. Between 12,700 and 11,300 cal yr BP, chironomid taxa indicate higher wetland water tables, as suggested by the presence of Zavrelia, Chironomus anthracinus/plumosus-type and Micropsectra, which are inhabitants of open-water, lacustrine areas. The open-steppe vegetation remained dominant in the watershed during this time. Increasing wetland moisture could be explained by: (1) cool summers that reduced the evaporation rate; and/or (2) a decrease in duration of the summer dry season. The period 11,300-8700 cal yr BP was characterized by lower wetland moisture, contemporaneous with a delay in the expansion of deciduous forest, suggesting persistent dry climate conditions throughout the beginning of the Holocene, which may have been related to the intensified seasonality of precipitation. Around 8700 cal yr BP, higher wetland water levels, inferred from chironomids, occurred simultaneously with the onset of regional deciduous forest expansion, probably caused by a shortening of the summer dry period. We concluded that chironomids are appropriate paleoecological proxies to investigate global and local hydrologic variability in the Middle East.					; Alizadeh Ketek Lahijani, Hamid/GRF-3549-2022; Azirani, Tayebeh/X-1018-2019; BRISSET, Elodie/M-9867-2013; Naderi Beni, Abdolmajid/AAQ-5777-2020; Gandouin, Emmanuel/AAM-9745-2021; Sharifi, Arash/J-4343-2019; ANDRIEU-PONEL, Valerie/J-2818-2014	Alizadeh Ketek Lahijani, Hamid/0000-0001-6136-3655; BRISSET, Elodie/0000-0001-8706-0505; Sharifi, Arash/0000-0002-2235-7815; NADERI BENI, ABDOLMAJID/0000-0002-0825-1539; Gandouin, Emmanuel/0000-0001-6970-9630; ANDRIEU-PONEL, Valerie/0000-0001-7044-967X													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2017	58	2					151	167		10.1007/s10933-017-9969-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9969-8													WOS:000404687500004

This study integrates sediment column experiments with molecular analyses to unravel the direct and indirect effects of thermal stratification on CH4 production and oxidation in Hongfeng Lake, a subtropical reservoir. The results reveal that thermal stratification leads to the formation of unique redox gradients, resulting in two peaks of CH4 concentration peaks in surface layer (-6 cm) and deeper sediments (19-22 cm), and the fluxes were observed in summer to be 9 times higher than those observed in winter. Isotopic tracing revealed acetate-driven methane increases across the sediment profile, highlighting the impact of algal-derived carbon on promoting methanogenesis. Methane oxidation in surface sediments was promoted by aerobic conditions following the dissipation of thermal stratification. Microbial community analysis showed that methanogenic archaea, particularly Methanocellales and Methanosarciniales, dominated under both conditions, with higher abundances in the presence of labile carbon substrates. The input of organic matter stimulates the decomposition of carbon and the release of methane within the sediment column, posing the risk of a short-term high-concentration methane release. These findings highlight the importance of thermal stratification, algal-derived carbon, and oxygen availability in regulating CH4 dynamics, providing new insights into the spatial and temporal variability of methane emissions in freshwater reservoirs. It emphasizes the need to quantify the risk of methane release caused by reservoir turbulence in the future and highlights the management through controlling nutrient input and artificially regulating reservoirs.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP	2025	391								126587	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126587								40684589					WOS:001555582800006

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE FORELAND AND HINTERLAND I: GEOCHRONOLOGY AND PLATE TECTONIC GEOMETRY OF ORDOVICIAN MAGMATISM AND TERRANE ACCRETION ON THE LAURENTIAN MARGIN OF NEW ENGLAND	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												U-Pb dates on magmatic and detrital zircon from samples in the hinterland of the Taconic orogen place new constraints on the timing and plate tectonic geometry of terrane accretion and magmatic arc activity. The Moretown terrane, a Gondwanan-derived exotic block, extends from the Rowe Schist-Moretown Formation contact in the west to the Bronson Hill arc in the east. Arc-related plutonic and volcanic rocks formed above an east-dipping subduction zone under the western leading edge of the Moretown terrane from approximately 500 to 475 Ma, until collision with hyperextended distal fragments of Laurentia, represented by the Rowe Schist, at 475 Ma. Magmatic arc rocks formed during this interval are primarily located in the Shelburne Falls arc, although some are also located in the Bronson Hill arc to the east. Metasedimentary rocks in the Shelburne Falls arc contain detrital zircon derived from mixing of Gondwanan, Laurentian, and arc sources, suggesting that the Moretown terrane was proximal to Laurentia by 475 Ma. Explosive eruptions at 466 to 464 Ma preserved in the Barnard Volcanic Member of the Missisquoi Formation in Vermont and as ash beds in the Indian River Formation in the Taconic allochthons may record slab-breakoff of subducted lithosphere following collision of the Moretown terrane with distal Laurentian crustal fragments. Between 466 and 455 Ma a reversal in subduction polarity lead to a west-dipping subduction zone under Laurentia and the newly accreted Moretown terrane. Magmatic arc rocks in the Bronson Hill arc formed above this west-dipping subduction zone along the eastern trailing edge of the Moretown terrane at approximately 455 to 440 Ma. The western boundary of Ganderia in New England is east of the Bronson Hill arc, buried beneath Silurian and Devonian rocks deformed during the Acadian orogeny.

However, there is great uncertainty in our mechanistic understanding of how DOM transformation and fate change as a function of land use. Herein, we conducted seasonal investigations of DOM optical properties, DOM bioavailability, microbial community composition and water quality across a forest -> agricultural -> urban land-use gradient in a subtropical plain river network of southeast China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and protein-like component C3 increased with increasing agricultural and urban land use, and was attributed primarily to allochthonous inputs (e.g., wastewater discharge) rather than autochthonous sources (e.g., algal blooms). Urban land-use amplified the seasonal variability of bio-labile DOM, but lowered terrestrial humic-like DOM by altering the hydrological connectivity between the river and riparian zone. DOM mineralization driven by microbial deoxygenation enhanced in situ production of humic-like C2 by utilizing bio-labile DOM from anthropogenic sources. DOM turnover was notably stronger in urban zones during summer versus winter and compared to agricultural and forest zones. DOM transformations and rates were synergistically regulated by key microbial communities (mainly Gammaproteobacteria), water temperature, pH and bio-labile substrate supply. Urbanization enhanced in situ production of refractory DOM, making it a hotspot for riverine microbial DOM transformations. Given the strong linkage between DOM transformations and greenhouse gas emissions, further studies are warranted to better constrain the impact of land-use change on riverine carbon budgets.

Partial cDNA sequences encoding HSP30, HSP70, HSP90 beta, and heat shock cognate (HSC) 70, and full-length cDNA sequences encoding HSP27, HSP47 and HSP60 were cloned from goldfish (Carassius auratus). The expression of these genes was investigated in goldfish inhabiting Gaobeidian Lake in Beijing, China. The water of this lake is moderately polluted and has a higher temperature due to the water being used as a coolant in the nearby thermal power plant. All HSP sequences tested were highly conserved compared with their corresponding genes in other species. A significant up-regulation in HSP30 and HSP70 transcripts was exhibited in goldfish collected in winter in Gaobeidian Lake. The up-regulation in HSP27 and HSP90 beta transcript, as well as HSP30, was observed on the day of collection in summer. The upregulation of these HSPs suggested that fish under these specific environmental conditions were experiencing a complex stress process. The expression of HSP30 was found to be more prominent among the fishes in Gaobeidian Lake than at the cleaner reference site (Huairou Reservoir). In the latter case, the HSP30 expression was almost non-detectable, suggesting the possibility of using it as a biomarker for complex environmental pollution. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We present here the first collation of published and unpublished data on the distribution and abundance of the species in eastern China in recent decades. Lesser White-fronted Goose numbers have declined greatly in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jiangsu Provinces between the late-1980s/early-1990s and recent years: the species' range has now mainly contracted to East Dongting Lake in Hunan. The relatively stable numbers at East Dongting Lake suggest that the population is not currently threatened, but the extreme concentration at one lake makes the species vulnerable. Lesser White-fronted Geese rely on very specific meadow vegetation exposed after water recession, so changes in water levels or recession timing, due to hydrological changes following the commissioning of the Three Gorges Dam, may affect biomass, palatability and plant species composition of the meadows. Thus, it is critically important to understand the wintering ecology and habitat needs of this threatened species at East Dongting Lake. It is also essential to conduct further synchronous Yangtze River floodplain surveys to assess the current status, distribution and habitat use of Lesser White-fronted Geese throughout the region.

Several deep-learning models trained to diagnose lee-wave occurrence, amplitude, wavelength, and orientation are applied to a 31-year high-resolution hindcast dataset covering 1982-2012, from UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) data, driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Building on previous work to examine lee-wave characteristics over Britain and Ireland, this study applies a new technique to a much larger dataset than has been used in the past. There is little diurnal variability observed in the occurrence and characteristics of lee waves. Spatially, most lee waves occur over hilly regions, such as the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District and the Pennines in England, and North Wales. Seasonally, lee waves occur more in the winter months than in the summer. The link between synoptic weather patterns and lee waves is quantified, with more lee waves produced and a higher likelihood of higher amplitude waves under patterns with faster synoptic wind speeds, such as the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO+). The mean orientation of waves is broadly in line with the synoptic wind direction, though with a large spread in some cases. High horizontal wind speeds aloft are a necessary but not sufficient indicator of high-amplitude lee waves. When other meteorological variables are used to predict the prevalence of lee waves using a random forest, the Scorer parameter is the most important for predicting the generation of lee waves alongside horizontal wind speed: there is less importance placed on the stability. This climatology provides a novel data-driven insight into the formation and propagation of lee waves over Britain and Ireland.

First detection of Aphanomyces astaci and its potential responsibility for mass mortalities of Pontastacus (Astacus) leptodactylus in Greek lakes	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-THESSALONIKI												Aphanomyces astaci is a pathogen categorized among the 100 worst invasive alien species, responsible for the crayfish plague disease. In the past, many disease outbreaks devastated native European crayfish populations. The pathogen was transferred in Europe by its natural carriers, among which is the North American crayfish species Pacifastacus leniusculus, that has been introduced in Greece during 1980s. On the other hand, Pontastacus leptodactylus is considered indigenous in the Evros river (Thrace, Greece) and, apart from being keystone organism, it constitutes a valuable food source. Following freshwater crayfish mass mortality events in lakes Polifitou and Vegoritida, we investigated the pathogen's presence in P. leptodactylus from these two lakes as well as in lake Volvi. All samples from lakes Polifitou and Vegoritida were positive, verifying the pathogen presence, to the best of our knowledge for the first time in Greece. On the other hand, all examined P. leniusculus individuals were surprisingly negative, despite the expected hypothesis that they could be the reason for the spread of the pathogen in Greece. The unfavorable environmental conditions observed during spring and summer 2023 in combination with the improper management practices may led to massive reduction of crayfish populations in lakes Vegoritida and Polifitou. Thus, there is an urgent need for deeper investigations to unveil the leading cause of the disease out-break in order to design and propose proper management measurements.

C, and 2-year-old mature spawning Kamloops trout (spring spawners) captured from Lake Okanagan, were subjected to 15 minutes strenuous exercise. Muscle glycogen was depleted in both groups. Following 30 minutes of moderate activity, muscle glycogen remained high in the 1 1/2-year-old trout. Liver glycogen levels were not significantly lowered during either strenuous or moderate exercise. Blood lactate levels were markedly elevated during 15 min. of strenuous exercise and continued to rise for 2 hours of post-exercise recovery in both groups of fish. In the 1 1/2-year-old trout, blood lactate declined to resting levels at about the 8th hour of recovery, and was increased 3-fold following 30 min. of moderate activity. Blood glucose and hemoglobin were not significantly altered during either strenuous or moderate activity. In the 1 1/2-year-old trout, starvation of up to 7 days duration resulted in a marked depletion of liver glycogen. There was little change in muscle glycogen, blood lactate, glucose or hemoglobin, regardless of whether or not the fish had been exercised at the beginning of the starvation period. Feeding during the period of recovery from 15 min. of strenuous exercise resulted in increases in both muscle and liver glycogen levels.																									1960	17	4					487	500		10.1139/f60-034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f60-034													WOS:A1960WV53200003

A data set of tree-ring width, radiocarbon and archaeological data, in addition to historical sources, were used to reconstruct fluctuations of the Great Aletsch, the Gorner and the Lower Grindelwald glaciers in the Swiss Alps. The three ice-streams experienced nearly synchronous advances at c. 1000 - 600 BC and AD 500 - 600, 800 - 900, 1100 - 1200 and 1300 - 1860. These glacier fluctuations show strong correspondence with lake-level variations reconstructed in eastern France ( Jura mountains and PreAlps) and on the Swiss Plateau. This supports the hypothesis of climatically driven fluctuations. Historical data available for the period since AD 1550 reveal, in detail, various meteorological conditions behind the successive glacier advances. However, in agreement with the general trend shown by the historical data, the synchroneity between glacier advances and periods of higher lake level suggests the impact of general winter cooling and an increase in summer moisture as responsible for reinforced feeding of both glaciers and lakes in west-central Europe over the past 3500 years. Finally, a comparison between the Great Aletsch glacier and the residual 14 degrees C records supports the hypothesis that variations in solar activity were a major forcing factor of climatic oscillations in west-central Europe during the late Holocene.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2005	15	6					789	801		10.1191/0959683605hl853ra	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl853ra													WOS:000231527900002

The main aim of this study was to present the 'Capo Peloro' lakes (southern Italy) case study, which highlights the advantageous use of ecotoxicological biomarkers in key copepod species, to reveal potential contamination in transitional water ecosystems. The focus was on changes that occur after the summer season, as during the summer, the surrounding human population increases significantly, with the consequent enhancement of anthropic pressures. Biomarkers were defined to monitor the zooplankton copepods Paracartia latisetosa, Acartia tonsa and Oithona brevicornis. Acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, and benzo(a) pyrene-monooxygenase activities were determined. P. latisetosa, A. tonsa and O. brevicornis show linear increases in their acetylcholinesterase activities with increasing concentrations in sample homogenates, which defines their high metabolic rates, and thus the suitability of these species as bioindicators. Biochemical alterations in these species induce changes in their biological attributes that can also lead to their disappearance, with a cascade of consequences for the higher trophic levels in the food chain. These data indicate that for the two lakes of Capo Peloro there is contamination by pesticides, carbamates and polycyclic and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. This occurs mainly at the end of the summer season, and only affects the species of the low trophic levels. This case study shows the benefits provided by this biomarker approach as applied to zooplankton species, to monitor transitional water ecosystems and to estimate their toxicological risk, and thus to provide an early warning signal for loss of ecosystem integrity.

Lake trout growth is sensitive to spring temperature in southwest Alaska lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												In high-latitude lakes, air temperature is an important driver of ice cover thickness and duration, which in turn influence water temperature and primary production supporting lake consumers and predators. In lieu of multidecadal observational records necessary to assess the response of lakes to long-term warming, we used otolith-based growth records from a long-lived resident lake fish, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush),as a proxy for production. Lake trout were collected from seven deep, oligotrophic lakes in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve on in southwest Alaska that varied in the presence of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) from anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Linear mixed-effects models were used to partition variation in lake trout growth by age and calendar-year and model comparisons tested for a mean increase in lake trout growth with sockeye salmon presence. Year effects from the best mixed-effects model were subsequently compared to indices of temperature, lake ice, and regional indices of sockeye salmon escapement. A strong positive correlation between annual lake trout growth and temperature suggested that warmer springs, earlier lake ice break-up, and a longer ice-free growing season increase lake trout growth via previously identified bottom-up increases in production with warming. Accounting for differences in the presence or annual escapement of sockeye salmon with available data did not improve model fit. Collectively with other studies, the results suggest that productivity of subarctic lakes has benefitted from warming spring temperatures and that temperature can synchronise otolith growth across lakes with and without sockeye salmon MDN.

Scavenging ratios of particulate inorganic ions (K+ and Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+) were used as a surrogate for those of FPBM and CPBM, respectively. FPBM and CPBM were estimated to contribute 8-36% and 5-27%, respectively, depending on the location, to total wet deposition. The rest of the 39-87% was attributed to the contribution of GOM. The average %GOM, %FPBM and %CPBM among all locations were 65%, 17%, and 18%, respectively. The relative distributions of %GOM, %FPBM, and %CPBM were influenced by Hg(II) gas-particle partitioning, urban site characteristics, and precipitation type. At the regional scale, %GOM dominated over %FPBM and %CPBM. However, the sum of FPBM and CPBM contributed to nearly half of the total Hg wet deposition in urban areas, which was greater than other site categories and is attributed to higher FPBM air concentrations. At four locations, %FPBM exceeded %GOM during winter in contrast to summer, suggesting the efficient snow scavenging of aerosols. The results from this study are useful in improving mercury transport models since most of these models do not estimate CPBM, but frequently use monitored mercury wet deposition data for model evaluation.

Climate variability involved increasing winter air temperatures and large inter-annual temperature and precipitation variation. Agriculture practices have transformed from high fertilizer usage (i.e. swine slurry) in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to high phosphate, ammonium, and BOD5 loadings, to low loadings after the collapse of soviet-type agriculture in the early 1990s. The 28-year monthly record on river flow and concentrations of nutrients (N, P) and dissolved organic matter (BOD5, CODMn) from four main tributaries was analysed with seasonal air temperature and precipitation data. Long-term trends in nutrient and organic matter loadings to Lake Vortsjarv resulted from agriculture and climate changes. The change could be traced as a linear trend in loadings and a highly inter-correlated cluster of the slurry-related pollutants. Coincidental trends in air temperature and fertiliser use caused strong correlations between air temperature and pollutant loadings to the rivers, which turned non-significant after removing trends showing that the relationships were not based on year-to-year differences. Residual analysis revealed significant positive correlations between precipitation and annual loadings of ammonium, phosphates, and CODMn. Both components forming the load (water discharge and concentrations of substances) increased in wet years. The effect of high winter North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) was expressed as more intensive river flow during winter months and decreased flow during the flood peak.

Perfluorodecane sulfonate was the predominant compound in fish. The detected frequencies and concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were very low in the water, sediments, and fish. Low detected frequencies and concentrations of long-chain PFASs led to relative low sediment-water partition coefficients and bioaccumulation factors. The concentration levels of PFASs in the two rivers were lower than those in other major rivers in China.					tingting, hu/AGX-8728-2022; Guo, Zhiyong/C-8749-2013; Guo, Zhiyong/N-9702-2019	Guo, Zhiyong/0000-0002-9876-7618; 													0007-4861	1432-0800				AUG	2018	101	2					166	172		10.1007/s00128-018-2381-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-018-2381-x								29905902					WOS:000439438200004

Between 8840 and 2500 BP, high C/N ratios Suggest that input to the lake was predominantly from terrestrial plants. The corresponding delta(13)C values thus provide a proxy for changes in catchment vegetation that are supported by pollen data. delta(13)C values in the early Holocene are relatively low, reflecting the dominance of C-3 vegetation (woody plants) and a more humid climate. delta(13)C shows no response to a known regional and interval at 7800 yr BP, Suggesting that woody vegetation was able to Survive relatively prolonged dry periods. A gradual, rather than sharp, delta(13)C response to the end of the early Holocene humid interval at similar to 4500 yr BP further supports this. Higher delta(13)C values at similar to2800-2300 and similar to 1000 yr BP correspond to increases in sedge pollen, thought to be growing in freshwater springs, exposed as lake-level fell. The C/N and delta(13)C Composition of bulk organic material complements the pollen evidence and may be useful in other lakes in savanna regions as indicators of terrestrial vegetation change.

We demonstrated how different ecophysiological strategies, such as resistance and/or utilization of sulfide and oxygen, light adaptation, or resistance to high water flow, allow each of the microorganisms described to efficiently colonize several areas within the environmental gradient. In the zone of the spring constantly influenced by sulfide-rich waters, biofilms were formed by purple bacteria, cyanobacteria, and filamentous colorless sulfur bacteria. Purple bacteria showed higher photosynthetic efficiency per pigment unit than cyanobacteria, although they were dominant only in anoxic areas. Two filamentous cyanobacteria, strain UVFP1 and strain UVFP2, were also abundant in the sulfide-rich area. Whereas the cyanobacterial strain UVFP2 shows a strategy based on the resistance to sulfide of oxygenic photosynthesis, strain UVFP1, additionally, has the capacity for sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis. Molecular phylogenetic analyses cluster the benthic strain UVFP1 with genus Planktothrix, but with no particular species, whereas UVFP2 does not closely cluster with any known cyanobacterial species. The colorless sulfur bacterium Thiothrix sp. extended throughout the zone in which both sulfide and oxygen were present, exhibiting its capacity for chemolithoautotrophic dark carbon fixation. Downstream from the source, where springwater mixes with well-oxygenated stream water and sulfide disappears, autotrophic biofilms were dominated by diatoms showing higher photosynthetic rates than cyanobacteria and, by a lesser extent, by a sulfide-sensitive cyanobacterium (strain UVFP3) well adapted to low light availability, although in the areas of higher water velocity far from the river shore, the dominance shifted to crust-forming cyanobacteria. Both types of microorganisms were highly sensitive to sulfide impeding them from occupying sulfide-rich areas of the spring. Sulfide, oxygen, light availability, and water velocity appear as the main factors structuring the autotrophic community of Fuente Podrida spring.

J	Li, HY; Alsanea, A; Barber, M; Goel, R				Li, Hanyan; Alsanea, Anwar; Barber, Michael; Goel, Ramesh			High-throughput DNA sequencing reveals the dominance of pico- and other filamentous cyanobacteria in an urban freshwater Lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The current study presents findings related to algal blooms in a freshwater lake, which has been experiencing severe cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs). Primarily, picocyanobacteria belonging to the genus Synechococcus and filamentous cyanobacterial group belonging to Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum dominated top water column during non-bloom and bloom periods respectively. The dominance of Synechococcus in early summer informs that blooming in Utah Lake starts in early summer and then later is taken over by other bloom-forming cyanobacteria, such as species belonging to the genus Aphanizomenon. A strong negative correlation (r = -0.9, p < 0.001) was found between the occurrence of Aphanizomenon and Synechococcus which correlates very well with the fact that the blooms of these two different cyanobacteria never coexisted. The predominance of cyanobacteria in 2017 was attributed more to temperature (r = 0.18, p < 0.001). The Actinobacteria was negatively correlated with primary production and high chlorophyll a concentration. Flavobacterium and Limnohabitans were the main phytoplankton colonizers and predators detected that could secrete extracellular enzymes to degrade algal exudates (such as proteins and polysaccharides). Additionally, cyanotoxins producers Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix accounted for up to 12.43% and 7.04% of total cyanobacteria abundance during blooms. The relative abundance of chloroplast reads was overall lower than the cyanobacteria reads, except for the May 5th sampling in 2017. There was interannual variability in the bloom-associated heterotrophic bacterial populations, but these populations were consistent with bloom-associated bacterial populations found in other lakes. Community diversity analysis for both Shannon and Simpson indices indicated lower community diversity during the bloom period. The beta diversity conducted by PCoA and UPGMA trees suggested the significant temporal rather than spatial impacts on shaping the phytoplankton community structures during the summer season.

Tectonically controlled drainage fragmentation in the southwestern Great Basin, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The area now occupied by the Great Basin, western USA, contained paleo-fluvial systems that predated the modern-day endorheic (closed) basins. The areal extent of these paleo-fluvial systems within the south-western Great Basin is known mainly from isolated remnants preserved in the modern mountain ranges. We document the age, extent, and tectonic disruption of Mio-Pliocene fluvial systems of the southwestern Great Basin. Synthesis of new field observations, geochemistry, and geochronology with existing studies defines two latest Miocene to Pliocene east-southeast flowing drainages that predated the modern endorheic basins. The drainage network was ultimately fragmented in Pliocene time (ca. 3.5-4 Ma). Fragmentation of the drainage network led to lake formation, drying of lakes, and the formation of isolated springs. The rapid environmental changes initiated by faulting and volcanism isolated previously interbreeding populations of spring-dwelling taxa and have caused divergent evolution since Pliocene time. Modern endemism within the region's springs is thus a direct consequence of intraplate tectonism.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				SEP-OCT	2023	135	9-10					2296	2314		10.1130/B36563.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B36563.1													WOS:001101571800007

Most of the previous studies on heavy metals based on the one time, the short-time or a local-scale survey. In this paper, [AVS] and [SEM] in Chaohu Lake surface sediments were studied for different seasons in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The results showed that: (a) The three-year average of [AVS] and [Sigma SEM] in surface sediments of Chaohu Lake is 4.2 mu mol center dot g(-1) and 2.31 mu mol center dot g(-1), respectively. The maximum of [AVS] appears on spot 5 (14.845 mu mol center dot g(-1)) in summer while the minimum appears on spot 9 (0.13 mu mol center dot g(-1)) in winter. (b) In spot 5 which near the estuary of Yuxi River, three-year average of [SEM] was the maximum (5.81 mu mol center dot g(-1)), and the minimum of [Sigma SEM] (0.07 mu mol center dot g(-1)) appears on spot 8 which locates in the middle of Chaohu Lake. In spot 13 the [Sigma SEM]-[AVS]=3.2>2 and [Sigma SEM]/[AVS]=4.45>2.34 indicate that heavy metal contaminants from Hefei city have threatened the biosafety of Chaohu Lake. (c) The spatial autocorrelation of SEMcd is weak, which indicates that spatial distribution of SEMcd is determined by anthropogenic factors rather than sediments' own attribute. Chaohu Lake has been heavily polluted by Cd from no-point source and electronic electroplating industry.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-804-2				2013	779-780						1213	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.779-780.1213	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.779-780.1213													WOS:000336106300233

Increased concentrations of fecal bacteria may pose public health risks associated with swimming and other recreational activities at beach sites. This study was carried out during the summer and early fall of 2013 to monitor Escherichia coli and Enterococci as indicator bacteria at Bradford Beach, along the shoreline of Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, WI. Enumeration of bacteria in beach sand and water samples was performed using the IDEXX Most Probable Number method. Deionized (DI) water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as the eluents for bacterial enumeration. The EPAs CANARY event detection software was used to analyze bacterial concentrations and identify anomalous water quality events. CANARY was deemed to be a useful statistical tool for analyzing fecal indicator bacteria concentration and providing timely information on beach contamination to reduce public health risks associated with pathogens. The model results indicate that beach sand can act as a potential reservoir for bacteria to survive longer than in water. In addition, the concentration of E. coli enumerated in DI water was higher than in PBS. The analysis of E. coli concentration in beach sand indicates the possibility of establishing a relationship between the results obtained using the two eluents. Furthermore, a correlation between the algal level and bacterial count was identified. The results from the CANARY software indicate that the presence of algae has a significant impact on the bacterial concentration.

Loss of 14C from the epilimnion was predominantly in the form of irreversible gas-exchange across the liquid-air interface. This loss was measured by 14C inventory of the epilimnion and thermocline waters. Using the Lewis and Whitman boundary layer model, values for the mass transfer coefficient of 126, 58 and 100 cm/d [day] were determined for 3 distinct phases in the deepening of the epilimnion during autumn cooling. The relationship between these mass transfer coefficients and the average wind speeds over the same 3 time periods were consistent with the results of previous wind-tunnel, gas-exchange experiments. Two significant features of the C budget during the course of the experiment were the large net outflux of CO2 from the corral (with PCO2 [partial pressure of CO2] in the epilimnion 3-7 times atmospheric levels) and the doubling of the total dissolved inorganic C (DIC) content of the epilimnion. The major source of C for these 2 processes was the entrainment of dissolved inorganic C as the epilimnion deepened during the cool days of late summer. Particulate organic C was also entrained and its oxidation contributed to the net DIC increase and CO2 loss. Simultaneous determinations of daily integral primary productivity by an incubator technique and by direct measurement of 14C uptake inside the enclosure were consistent. Dark respiration was 45-53% of daily integral primary productivity, but total respiration was nearly 2 times that for dark plus light respiration. Net primary productivity was substantially negative.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					464	471		10.1139/f80-060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-060													WOS:A1980JJ97200017

The presence of permanent arable fields as well as arable fields with short fallow Phases and shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn has been discussed. To test these hypotheses experimentally vie have been conducting tests in a forest northeast of Stuttgart since 1994. The slightly south-exposed experimental area of approximately 4.5 ha on a loess soil is covered by mixed deciduous forest, is available for at least 20 years and has been divided into 34 plots of 30 x 30 m. Up to 2001, five plots were used for experiments. The normal procedure is clearing, burning the dry small timber (less than 10 cm in diameter) and then growing winter cereals (bread wheat) for one season. The yields were between 2000 and 4000 kg grains per ha. The harvest was more or less free from weeds. First attempts with summer crops gave much lower yields of about I 100 kg grains per ha. Continuous cereal growing on the same place in the following years resulted in minimal to zero yields, mainly due to vigorous weed growth. These weeds are not crop weeds, but forest perennials of clearings and forest fringes. Ploughing to remove the weeds is not possible, because of the presence of roots and tree-stumps, most of them still living. Weed regulation by hoeing, burning or cattle grazing remains to lie tested. Protection of the crop from game and birds is by fences and nets, but protection from mice seems difficult, In the spectra from the pollen traps, clearing and burning are strongly indicated, but cereal growing only slightly.

Hypolimnetic oxygenation 3: an engineered switch from eutrophic to a meso-/oligotrophic state in a California reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. A long-term improvement in water quality due to a hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS) used without other management actions was shown for Camanche Reservoir in California (volume = 514 million m(3)). Prior to oxygenation, the reservoir was eutrophic with low water clarity, high chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and blooms of cyanobacteria primarily caused by internal nutrient loading from anoxic sediments. All 4 trophic state indicators showed major improvement, most pointing to a new oligotrophic state. Days after HOS startup in July 1993, hypolimnion soluble phosphate and ammonium concentrations declined and, unexpectedly, nitrate remained low. This report covers pre-HOS (1988 to mid-1993) and 12 yr of post-HOS measurements (mid-1993 to mid-2005). For surface waters during the growth season (Apr-Oct) after HOS, average Chl-a decreased 79% (14.6-3.1 mu g/L) and peak Chl-a decreased sixfold (from 49 to 8 mu g/L). Average Secchi depth increased 10-fold (0.47 to 4.9 m) and peak Secchi depth doubled (4.2-8 m). Cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum, formerly Anabaena) decreased >95% while the previously absent Merismopedia, an indicator of clean water, appeared. The large colonial diatom Fragilaria also decreased by >90%. Zooplankton (rotifers and crustaceans) appeared unchanged. After HOS, late winter surface nutrients prior to the next spring bloom were much reduced (total phosphorus, TP, by 58%, total inorganic nitrogen, TIN, by 88%). The TIN:TP ratio dropped from 6 to 1.6. In 2004, the last full year of measurements, further declines were found for nitrate nitrogen (42-3 mu g/L) and Chl-a (3.1-2.8 mu g/L) while TP was unchanged (14 mu g/L).																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2019	35	3			SI		338	353		10.1080/10402381.2019.1648613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1648613		SEP 2019											WOS:000485847900001
J	Francl, KE				Francl, Karen E.			Summer bat activity at woodland seasonal pools in the northern Great Lakes region	WETLANDS												Woodland seasonal pools in the northern Great Lakes region, limited in this study to northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, are potentially important sites for bat feeding and drinking. In order to determine the influence of pool size, hydroperiod, and structural complexity on relative bat activity, I surveyed pools (17 in 2004, eight in 2005 and 2006) at approximately two-week intervals throughout the summer, documenting bat species use with mist nets and AnaBat II echolocation recording systems. In 189 mist net-nights over three summers, I captured 114 individuals and identified 21,591 AnaBat call sequences. Little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) dominated the captures (75.4%) and AnaBat call sequences (83.3%). Northern myotis (M. septentrionalis) were less common (19.3% of captures, 6.4% of identified call sequences) but ubiquitous across pools. Four additional species (Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Lasionycteris noctivagans) were more commonly documented at larger pools. Across all years, relative bat activity (as estimated by call sequences per night) was significantly influenced by pool size (more activity at small and large pools than medium pools) and covaried with the proportion of water remaining in the pool. My study emphasizes the utility of pools of all sizes to bats, as larger-bodied bats preferentially use larger pools, while smaller-bodied Myotis spp. are capable of foraging at pools of all sizes. Relative activity of all species was secondarily driven by pool hydroperiod, as the number of bat call sequences per night decreased as the amount of open water declined.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2008	28	1					117	124		10.1672/07-104.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/07-104.1													WOS:000255117200010

However, the research on the environmental transport behaviors of OPEs between atmospheric deposition and soil is very limited. In this study, we investigated the contamination levels and seasonal variations of OPEs in atmospheric deposition samples (n = 33) collected from an area of South China every month between February 2021 and January 2022, and evaluated the contribution of OPEs in atmospheric deposition to soil. The concentrations of & sum;(21)target-OPEs ranged from 3670 to 18,600 ng/g dry weight (dw), with a mean of 8200 ng/g dw (median: 7600 ng/g dw). & sum;(21)target-OPEs concentrations in all atmospheric deposition samples exhibited significant seasonal differences (p < 0.05) with higher concentrations observed in winter and lower concentrations in summer. Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (TDTBPP) was the most dominant target OPE in atmospheric deposition (4870 ng/g dw), and its seasonal variation trend was consistent with & sum;21OPEs (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, in order to further explore the effect of atmospheric deposition on the levels of OPEs in soil of the study region, input fluxes and accumulation increments were estimated. Ten OPEs (including seven target OPEs and three suspect OPEs) exhibited high input flux means and accumulation increments, indicating that these compounds are prone to accumulate in soil via atmospheric deposition. It is noteworthy that the non-target phosphonate analyte bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) dibutyl ethane-1,2-diylbis(phosphonate) (BDTBPDEDBP) was detected at highest median concentration (8960 ng/g dw) in atmospheric deposition. Correspondingly, the average input flux and accumulation increment of BDTBPDEDBP were higher than those of all target and suspect OPEs. Collectively, this study quantifies the environmental transport behavior of OPEs between atmospheric deposition and soil, and provides new evidences for the fact that atmospheric deposition is the important pollution source of OPEs in soil.					黄, 先生/HDN-7563-2022; Su, Guanyong/LCD-3731-2024; Su, Guanyong/A-7747-2017	Su, Guanyong/0000-0003-4356-5194													0304-3894	1873-3336				AUG 15	2024	475								134845	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134845		JUN 2024						38876016					WOS:001254199500001

Predicting the Net Basin Supply to the Great Lakes with a Hydrometeorological Model	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The paper presents the incremental improvement of the prediction of the Great Lakes net basin supply (NBS) with the hydrometeorological model Modelisation Environmentale Surface et Hydrologie (MESH) by increasing the accuracy of the simulated NBS components (overlake precipitation, lake evaporation, and runoff into the lake). This was achieved through a series of experiments with MESH and its parent numerical weather prediction model [the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale model in its regional configuration (GEM Regional)]. With forcing extracted from operational GEM Regional forecasts, MESH underestimated the NBS in fall and winter. The underestimation increased when the GEM precipitation was replaced with its corrected version provided by the Canadian Precipitation Analysis. This pointed to overestimated lake evaporation and prompted the revision of the parameterization of the surface turbulent fluxes over water used both in MESH and GEM. The revised parameterization was validated against turbulent fluxes measured at a point on Lake Superior. Its use in MESH reduced the lake evaporation and largely corrected the NBS underestimation. However, the Lake Superior NBS became overestimated, signaling an inconsistency between the reduced lake evaporation and the prescribed precipitation. To remove the inconsistency, a new forcing dataset (including precipitation) was generated with the GEM model using the revised flux parameterization. A major NBS simulation improvement was obtained with the new atmospheric forcing reflecting the atmospheric response to the modified surface fluxes over the lakes. Additional improvements resulted by correcting the runoff with a modified snowmelt rate and by insertion of observed streamflows. The study shows that accurate lake evaporation simulation is crucial for accurate NBS prediction.					; Fortin, Vincent/H-3645-2014	BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220; Fortin, Vincent/0000-0002-2145-4592; 													1525-755X					DEC	2012	13	6					1739	1759		10.1175/JHM-D-11-0151.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-11-0151.1													WOS:000312628700006
J	Wrzesinski, D; Ptak, M				Wrzesinski, Dariusz; Ptak, Mariusz			An investigation of water level fluctuations in Polish lakes in various phases of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation	GEOLOGY GEOPHYSICS AND ENVIRONMENT												The North Atlantic Oscillation is a macroscale type of circulation determining climate and hydrological conditions in Europe. The paper presents water level fluctuations in 19 Polish lakes in various phases of NAO of the winter season in the years 1976-2010. Correlations of the winter NAO index with monthly, seasonal, maximum, and minimum water stages, and annual water level amplitudes in lakes were calculated. Approximately 20% of the performed tests showed statistical significance. Lakes were recorded where the correlations were significant in a major part of the year, as well as lakes showing no significant correlations in any month. Deviations of mean water stages in the positive and negative phase of NAO from mean water stages were calculated for each of the lakes. This permitted classifying the lakes into two groups by Ward's method based on deviations of water stages in the positive and negative phase of NAO(DJFM) from average values. This resulted in the designation of 4 and 5 typological classes of lakes, respectively. Deviations of water stages in lakes in various phases of NAO(DJFM) from mean values were determined to even exceed 20 cm. The study results can find practical applications in reference to water retention. In view of the observed environmental changes, it is possible that the hydrotechnical infrastructure on lakes will have to be developed in the future. Such a situation will permit the precise control of water level fluctuations for the purpose of the optimal adaptation of lakes for economic purposes.					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447; 													2299-8004	2353-0790					2017	43	2					151	163		10.7494/geol.2017.43.2.151	http://dx.doi.org/10.7494/geol.2017.43.2.151													WOS:000493292300005
J	Field, HR; Armstrong, WH; Huss, M				Field, Hannah R.; Armstrong, William H.; Huss, Matthias			Gulf of Alaska ice-marginal lake area change over the Landsat record and potential physical controls	CRYOSPHERE												Lakes in contact with glacier margins can impact glacier evolution as well as the downstream biophysical systems, flood hazard, and water resources. Recent work suggests positive feedbacks between glacier wastage and ice-marginal lake evolution, although precise physical controls are not well understood. Here, we quantify ice-marginal lake area change in understudied northwestern North America from 1984-2018 and investigate climatic, topographic, and glaciological influences on lake area change. We delineate time series of sampled lake perimeters (n = 107 lakes) and find that regional lake area has increased 58% in aggregate, with individual proglacial lakes growing by 1.28 km(2) (125 %) and ice-dammed lakes shrinking by 0.04 km(2) (15 %) on average. A statistical investigation of climate reanalysis data suggests that changes in summer temperature and winter precipitation exert minimal direct influence on lake area change. Utilizing existing datasets of observed and modeled glacial characteristics, we find that large, wide glaciers with thick lake-adjacent ice are associated with the fastest rate of lake area change, particularly where they have been undergoing rapid mass loss in recent times. We observe a dichotomy in which large, low-elevation coastal proglacial lakes have changed most in absolute terms, while small, interior lakes at high elevation have changed most in relative terms. Generally, the fastest-changing lakes have not experienced the most dramatic temperature or precipitation change, nor are they associated with the highest rates of glacier mass loss. Our work suggests that, while climatic and glaciological factors must play some role in determining lake area change, the influence of a lake's specific geometry and topographic setting overrides these external controls.					; Huss, Matthias/JLL-6340-2023; Armstrong, William/JFS-3710-2023	Armstrong, William/0000-0002-5581-6109; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				JUL 15	2021	15	7					3255	3278		10.5194/tc-15-3255-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3255-2021													WOS:000674296600001

Population densities obtained from census data were transformed into biovolumes, and phytoplankton species were categorized into three size fractions: net phytoplankton (a parts per thousand yen4,000 mu m(3) cell(-1), a parts per thousand yenca. 20 mu m in diameter), large nanophytoplankton (100-4,000 mu m(3) cell(-1), ca. 6-20 mu m in diameter), and small nanophytoplankton (< 100 mu m(3) cell(-1), < ca. 6 mu m in diameter). Although the annual total biovolume gradually decreased over time, the total biovolumes in winter and spring were found to increase. Furthermore, a decrease in the biovolume of net phytoplankton and an increase in that of small nanophytoplankton were observed. Because of succession in the phytoplankton community, the average cell volume of the phytoplankton community decreased from 269 mu m(3) cell(-1) in the 1980s to 56 mu m(3) cell(-1) in the 2000s. Lake warming accompanied with the intensification of thermal stratification and the augmentation of wind speed were observed at Lake Biwa over the study period. Serial analysis correcting for autocorrelation revealed that oligotrophication in the epilimnion, induced by lake warming and limitation of light available for phytoplankton growth by wind-induced water mixing, was a potential factor in the succession of the phytoplankton community.

Thermal biology and bioenergetics of different upriver migration strategies in a stock of summer-run Chinook salmon	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												By combining biotelemetry with animal-borne thermal loggers, we re-created the thermal histories of 21 summer-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) migrating in the Puntledge River, a hydropower impacted river system on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Daily maximum water temperatures in the Puntledge River during the summer-run adult Chinook salmon migration and residency period frequently exceeded 21 degrees C, a value that has been observed to elicit behavioral thermoregulation in other Chinook salmon populations. We therefore compared river temperatures to body temperatures of 16 fish that migrated through the river to understand if cool-water refuge was available and being used by migrants. In addition, we used thermal histories from fish and thermal loggers distributed in the river to model the effect of thermal habitat on energy density using a bioenergetics model. In general, we found no evidence that cool-water refuge existed in the river, suggesting that there is no opportunity for fish to behaviorally thermoregulate during upriver migration through the regulated portion of the river. Of the thermal histories used in the bioenergetics model, fish that reached an upstream lake were able to access cooler, deeper waters, which would have reduced energy consumption compared to fish that only spent time in the warmer river. Consequently, the Puntledge River water temperatures are likely approaching and in some cases exceeding the thermal limits of the summer-run Chinook salmon during the spawning migration. Further warming may cause more declines in the stock. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Low effect of viruses on bacteria in deep anoxic water and sediment of a productive freshwater reservoir	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The seasonal and vertical distribution of freshwater viruses and the related induced bacterial mortality were determined in the water column down to the surface sediments of the thermally stratified reservoir Lake Grangent, France, between March and November 2007 in relation to environmental parameters. Viral abundance (VA, range = 0.9 to 3.5 x 10(10) l(-1)), bacterial abundance (BA), and the frequency of infected cells were significantly higher in the oxic than in the anoxic waters, which was partly related to forcing from the thermal stratification together with vertical changes in dissolved oxygen, ammonia and phytoplankton biomass. BA was the best predictor (R 2 = 0.78) for VA in the oxygenated waters only. The virus-to-bacteria ratio (VBR) yielded less variability and did not differ significantly along the water column (mean +/- SD value = 5.5 +/- 1.3). In the sediments, both VA and BA were one order of magnitude higher than in the water column with a higher variable VBR ratio (10.6 +/- 8.9). Paradoxically, the frequency of visibly infected bacterial cells (determined from transmission electron microscopy) in the sediments was significantly lower (on average 3- to 7-fold) compared with the water column, which is in agreement with recent benthic reports in geographically contrasting lake environments. On average, viruses destroyed 23% of bacterial production in the oxygenated surface waters, but only 9% in deep anoxic waters and 3% in the sediments. Overall, there was a remarkably low viral influence on heterotrophic bacteria in the anoxic waters and overlying sediments of Lake Grangent, where recurrent shift from summer planktonic to winter benthic phases in cyanobacterial blooms is typical.

J	Zhu, CW; Wang, B; Qian, WH; Zhang, B				Zhu, Congwen; Wang, Bin; Qian, Weihong; Zhang, Bo			Recent weakening of northern East Asian summer monsoon: A possible response to global warming	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We investigate the possible causes of the weakening of northern East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) from 1954 to 2010. We found that the decreased intensity of northern EASM as measured by a circulation index (EASMI) is significantly correlated with the increase of the surface air temperature (SAT) averaged over the Lake Baikal region (45 degrees-65 degrees N, 80 degrees-130 degrees E) defined as SATI. Corresponding to increasing SATI, an anomalous low-level anticyclone occurs with northeasterly prevailing over northern East Asia (30 degrees-50 degrees N, 100 degrees-130 degrees E), resulting in a weakened southwesterly monsoon winds and drier climate in this region. Numerical experiments with the community atmosphere model version 3 (CAM3) show that the joint forcing induced by greenhouse gases (GHG), sea surface temperature (SST), solar radiance (SR), and volcano activity (VC) can replicate the observed trend of SATI and its related circulation anomalies, but without GHG forcing the model failed to simulate the warming trend of SATI after 1970s. This implies that the global warming is likely responsible for the local warming around the Lake Baikal, which in turn weakens the northern EASM in recent decades. Citation: Zhu, C., B. Wang, W.

In the Heet region (west of Iraq), two distinct forms of natural asphalt (NA) deposits exist: rock asphalt and sulfur spring asphalt. This study focused on using NA sourced from sulfur springs. The aim was to investigate the potential of incorporating NA into local asphalt mixtures. To achieve this, NA was heated to 163 degrees C for varying durations. After heat treatment, laboratory tests were conducted on NA. The findings suggest that by heating NA for 20 hours, it conforms to Iraqi specifications in terms of physical properties. Furthermore, compared to conventional petroleum asphalt, treated NA showed greater resistance to temperature fluctuations, making it ideal for hotter climates. The study also found that NA enhances mechanical properties significantly. Specifically, the NA mixture recorded the highest indirect tensile strength, with a tensile strength ratio of 81.2%, a slight increase of 0.37% over traditional mixes. In summary, NA mixtures exhibit commendable performance. Given its abundance and affordability in Iraq, after considering heat treatment costs and environmental impact, NA holds promise for the future of asphalt concrete production for the construction of flexible pavement.					hamed, Roaa/AAG-9055-2019; Ahmed Mohammed, Fatima/NUQ-0531-2025; Albayati., Amjad/I-5473-2019	albayati, amjad/0000-0003-0497-9060													2147-1762						2024	37	3					1154	1170		10.35378/gujs.1282239	http://dx.doi.org/10.35378/gujs.1282239													WOS:001415395600002

In Turkey it is a non-native species and it is present with several acclimatised populations. A population of C. zillii, which almost certainly originated from aquarium industry ponds located in the area of Burdur, is well-established in the Pinarbasi Spring Creek (Burdur, Turkey). This paper aims to study the population structure and some growth properties of C. zillii living in Pmarbast Spring Creek. For this purpose, age and sex composition and length-weight relationships were examined and then compared with those reported for other populations. During the study period (from November 2013 to June 2016), a total of six fish species (C. zillii, Oreochromis niloticus. Oxynoemacheilus anatolicus, Gambusia holbrooki, Carassius gibelio, Clarias sp.) were caught by electrofishing. Among all, C. zillii has the highest abundance (54.77%). Totally, 155 specimens of C. zillii, ranging in size from 2.4 to 20.5 cm in total length and from 0.16 to 166.1 g in total weight, were collected. Of all the examined C. zillii, 80 specimens were immature, 44 were female and 31 were male. The overall sex ratio of females to males was 0.7:1. Ages of captured specimens ranged from 0 to IV. The length-weight relationship for all individuals was described by the parameters a = 0.0078 and b = 3.3543.

J	Brunelle, A; Whitlock, C				Brunelle, A; Whitlock, C			Postglacial fire, vegetation, and climate history in the Clearwater Range, Northern Idaho, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The environmental history of the Northern Rocky Mountains was reconstructed using lake sediments from Burnt Knob Lake, Idaho, and comparing the results with those from other previously published sites in the region to understand how vegetation and fire regimes responded to large-scale climate changes during the Holocene. Vegetation reconstructions indicate parkland or alpine meadow at the end of the glacial period indicating cold-dry conditions. From 14,000 to 12,000 cal yr B.P., abundant Pinus pollen suggests warmer, moister conditions than the previous period. Most sites record the development of a forest with Pseudotsuga ca. 9500 cal yr B.P. indicating warm dry climate coincident with the summer insolation maximum. As the amplification of the seasonal cycle of insolation waned during the middle Holocene, Pseudotsuga was replaced by Pinus and Abies suggesting cool, moist conditions. The fire reconstructions show less synchroneity. In general, the sites west of the continental divide display a fire-frequency maximum around 12,000-8000 cal yr B.P., which coincides with the interval of high summer insolation and stronger-than-present subtropical high. The sites on the east side of the continental divide have the highest fire frequency ca. 6000-3500 cal yr B.P. and may be responding to a decrease in summer precipitation as monsoonal circulation weakened in the middle and late Holocene. This study demonstrated that the fire frequency of the last two decades does not exceed the historical range of variability in that periods of even higher-than-present fire frequency occurred in the past.

Eighteen water samples were analysed for major ions and trace elements to assess the variability of water quality of the lake for various purposes. Geostatistics, the theory of regionalized variables, was then used to enhance the dataset and estimate some missing spatial values. Results indicated that the concentration of major ions in the water samples in winter was higher than in summer. The scatter diagrams suggested the dominance of alkaline earths over the alkali elements. Three types of water were identified in the lake that are referred to as Ca-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and hybrid types. The lake water was found to be controlled by rock-water interaction with carbonate lithology as a dominant source of the solutes. The major (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NO3 and HCO3-, CO3 and Cl) and trace elements of the lake water were within the World Health Organization standards, therefore the lake water was considered chemically safe for drinking purposes. Although NO3 concentration (ranging from 1.72 to 2 mg/L), is within the permissible limit and not very alarming, the gradually increasing trend is not acceptable. It is however, important to guard its spatio-temporal variability as the water is used for domestic as well as agricultural purposes. This study is significant as hydrogeological information on such high altitude lakes in India is scanty.					; Ahmed, Shakeel/ABA-5214-2021; Jeelani, Gh/KII-0203-2024	SARAH, SARAH/0000-0003-2911-8523; Ahmed, Shakeel/0000-0002-7662-3488; 													2347-4327	0973-774X				JUN	2011	120	3					399	411		10.1007/s12040-011-0081-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-011-0081-6													WOS:000293098500006

NATURAL HISTORY AND SPREAD OF BRAZILIAN PEPPERTREE (SCHINUS TEREBINTHIFOLIA; ANACARDIACEAE) IN FLORIDA AND ITS ROLE IN RANGE EXPANSION BY TETYRA ANTILLARUM KIRKALDY (HEMIPTERA: SCUTELLERIDAE)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi), a native South American tree, has invaded disturbed sites and natural areas in peninsular Florida. We report Brazilian peppertree as a new host for a little-known heteropteran, the Neotropical scutellerid, Tetyra antillarum (Kirkaldy), whose U.S. distribution is restricted to Florida. In 2016 to 2019 and 2021, we collected a total of 10 nymphs (all instars except IV) and 56 adults by beating fruit-laden branches in mid-February, early March, and early April. Multiple introductions of Brazilian peppertree in south Florida and eventual intraspecific hybridization of two haplotypes (Miami area and Gulf Coast) created genotypes more suited to Florida's climate, which fueled aggressive northward expansion in the peninsula. We review the history of Brazilian peppertree's planting in Florida and its northward expansion in the interior of the peninsula. As a corollary, we propose that Brazilian peppertree's northern spread in the peninsula triggered subsequent range expansion by T. antillarum. Our supposition is based on fruit of the novel host being available in fall and winter when fruits of most other woody plants are lacking, coupled with absence of the bug's other known host, gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba [L.] Sarg.); this tropical tree is not hardy in the Lake Wales Ridge where T. antillarum was most numerous. First collected at Key West in 1887, the scutellerid now is known from the peninsula's northeasternmost county, Nassau, which borders on Georgia. We present new records of T. antillarum from Florida and countries in Central America and the West Indies, and new state records for Mexico. Certain U.S records of T. antillarum posted on the internet are referred to T. bipunctata (Herrich-Schaeffer).																			0013-8797					JAN	2022	124	1					150	163		10.4289/0013-8797.124.1.150	http://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.124.1.150													WOS:000855959300015

Bog and lake sediment archives reveal a lagged response of subarctic lakes to diminishing atmospheric Hg and Pb deposition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We used a flux deconstruction approach on peat and sediment archives of four bogs and five lakes from two subarctic taiga ecoregions of the Northwest Territories (Canada) to distinguish the atmospheric and catchment based responses to changing metal pollution emissions over the last 2000 years. Bogs tracked the atmospheric signal, whereas lake sediments provided a mixed atmospheric and catchment-based response. Anthropogenic mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) contamination was identified in lake sediment and bog records from the mid 1800s onward and increased rapidly after ca. 1900. Long-range transport of Hg and Pb was likely the dominant source of the post-1900 enrichment in lake sediments, with minor contributions from local mining, mostly between 1950 and 1970. Bogs and sediment records of small lakes on the Taiga Plains showed that atmospheric deposition peaked in the late 1990s for Pb and in the 1970s for Hg. In contrast, the Pb and Hg accumulation rates in Taiga Shield lakes have continued to increase since the peak atmospheric deposition period due to on-going catchment transport, and may reflect recent climate change favoring late-fall and early-winter precipitation as rain rather than snow. The divergent trends in metal accumulation rates between ecoregions and environmental archives demonstrate that interactions of climate and catchment characteristics will be key to future contamination trajectories for subarctic lakes following reductions of anthropogenic metal emissions in North America.

J	Engelsma, MY; Roozenburg, I; Joly, JP				Engelsma, Marc Y.; Roozenburg, Ineke; Joly, Jean-Pierre			First isolation of Nocardia crassostreae from pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Europe	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												In summer 2006 an extensive mortality of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas occurred in Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands. A sample of Pacific oysters was investigated for the presence of shellfish pathogens as potential causes of the mortality. Yellow-green lesions were observed in several oysters upon clinical inspection. Histopathology showed that 6 out of 36 oysters had a suspected bacterial infection, including 4 Nocardia-like infections. Two bacterial species, Vibrio aestuarianus and Nocardia crassostreae, were isolated from haemolymph samples and identified using PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This is the first isolation of N. crassostreae from shellfish in European waters. The near full-length 16S rRNA sequence of this Dutch Nocardia sp. isolate was identical to other known N. crassostreae isolates from the west coast of North America. The primary cause of oyster mortality was thought to be the physiological stress from environmental conditions, including prolonged high water temperatures and low oxygen levels. The multiple bacterial species isolated from the diseased Pacific oysters may have been a secondary cause.

Although changes in monsoon intensity and monsoon rainfall since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have been extensively studied from various archives and proxies, the variability of terrestrial temperature changes in the ASM region is still poorly constrained, largely due to the lack of quantitative paleotemperature reconstructions in the northern ASM region. Here, we report a quantitative mean growing-season temperature (May-September, T-grow) record for the northmost ASM region over the past similar to 28.1 ka, based on the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in sediments from a small alpine lake in northeastern China. Our record shows an overall 7 degrees C deglacial warming from the termination of LGM to early Holocene, probably driven by the rising local growing-season insolation, the increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases, and the retreating ice-sheets. During the Holocene, our data display a gradual cooling trend of 1 degrees C, strongly influenced by the decreasing local growing-season insolation, but offset by the gradual increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases and the retreating ice-sheets to some extent. Within the Heinrich Stadial 1 (H1) interval, our record reveals a detailed feature with a large initial cooling and then a gradual warming in the northern ASM region, which differs to the persistent warming trend driven by atmospheric greenhouse gases in the southern ASM region, likely suggesting a stronger influence of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) on temperature changes in the northern ASM region. Our results demonstrate a spatially heterogeneous in temperature variability between the northern and southern ASM region, in particular over the pronounced H1 cold interval during the last deglaciation.

It was found that a source of nutrients were bottom sediments. The phenomenon has been studied by applying a new approach based on the assumption of interrelation between heat and mass transfer across the sediment-water interface. During the autumn cooling, the upper sediment layer is warmer than the near-bottom water that may cause a convective instability in pore water with high nutrient concentration. Under certain conditions, the Rayleigh number (the main parameter characterizing a density convection) becomes higher than the critical one. As a result, the viscous density convection starts to develop in the pore water. In this case nutrients transfer across the sediment-water interface by thermal macrovolumes with positive buoyancy. The effectiveness of such mass transfer is several orders greater than that of molecular diffusion. This hypothesis was checked by special field and laboratory experiments which were carried out on shallow Lake Krasnoye. The mathematical model of this phenomenon was developed and verified against numerous experimental data.																			0018-8158						1999	408						153	157		10.1023/A:1017067532346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017067532346													WOS:000084892400017

Atmospheric deposition of particles at a sensitive alpine lake: Size-segregated daily and annual fluxes from passive sampling techniques	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tahoe, a North American alpine lake long appreciated for its clear water and geographic setting, has experienced a trend of declining water clarity due to increasing nutrient and particle inputs. Contributions from atmospheric deposition of particulate matter (PM) could be important, yet they are inadequately quantified. This study established a yearlong deposition monitoring network in the northern Lake Tahoe Basin. Dry deposition was quantified on surrogate surfaces while wet deposition was based on particles suspended in precipitation at 24-hour resolution. The particle size ranges by these passive techniques were 1-64 mu mand 0.5-20 mu min diameter for dry and wet deposition, respectively. Dry deposition of submicrometer (0.5-1 mu m) particles was also estimated by extrapolation of a lognormal size distribution. Higher daily number deposition fluxes (NDFdry and NDFwet) were found at a near-shore site, confirming substantial impacts of commercial and tourist activities. The two more isolated sites indicated a uniform regional background. On average, daily NDFdry is about one order of magnitude lower than daily NDFwet. Dry deposition velocities increased rapidlywith particle size, as evidenced by collocatedmeasurements of NDFdry and ambient particle number concentrations, though it seemsless so for wet deposition due to different scavenging mechanisms. Despite fewer "wet" days than "dry" days during the monitoring period, wet processes dominated seasonal particle deposition, particularly in winter and spring when most precipitation occurred. Adopting sediment (insoluble, inorganic) particle fraction estimates from the literature, this study reports an annual particle flux of 2.9-5.2 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for sediment particles with 1-20 mu m diameter and 6.1-11 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for those with 0.5-20 mu m diameter. Implications of these findings to the current knowledge of atmospheric deposition in the Lake Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Walker, D; Owen, JAK				Walker, D; Owen, JAK			The characteristics and source of laminated mud at Lake Barrine, Northeast Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In a small (1 km(2)) crater lake in the Australian upland tropics (17 degrees 15'S, 145 degrees 38'E, 721 m a.s.l.), laminated mud has accumulated throughout the past 5 ka. It is limited to a central region below 50-67 m of water where it is protected by a monimolimnion. The contents of the laminae (e.g., total lake products, organic detritus, diatoms, pollen grains, vivianite crystals) distinguish two contrasting types, namely detritus-rich and detritus-poor. Judged against radiocarbon dates over long sequences, these couplets are not annual. Gravimetric, mineralogical and chemical observations on the mud, and on suspended organic and inorganic matter caught through several periods, indicate some diagenetic changes across the mud-water interface. Diatom analyses do not assist in relating mud type to source or period of origin. The most likely mechanism of lamination is that continuous deposition of clay, with small and varied detrital accompaniment, is periodically enhanced by greater detrital input. This occurs in some, but not all, periods of winter isothermy when ground temperatures fall to zero and below on several consecutive nights. This leads to the stirring of sediments in water shallower than 50 m and their relocation in the deeper meromictic zone. Fine Variations in, e.g., diatom content, partly independent of lamination type, probably contain a wealth of detail about the lake's environmental history. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Zhang, L; Tan, ZQ; Yao, J				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Zhang, Li; Tan, Zhiqiang; Yao, Jing			Investigation of Water Temperature Variations and Sensitivities in a Large Floodplain Lake System (Poyang Lake, China) Using a Hydrodynamic Model	REMOTE SENSING												Although changes in water temperature influence the rates of many ecosystem processes in lakes, knowledge of the water temperature regime for large floodplain lake systems subjected to multiple stressors has received little attention. The coupled models can serve to derive more knowledge on the water temperature impact on lake ecosystems. For this purpose, we used a physically-based hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport model to examine the spatial and temporal behavior and primary causal factors of water temperature within the floodplain of Poyang Lake that is representative of shallow and large lakes in China. Model performance is assessed through comparison with field observations and remote sensing data. The daily water temperature variations within Poyang Lake were reproduced reasonably well by the hydrodynamic model, with the root mean square errors of 1.5-1.9 degrees C. The modeling results indicate that the water temperature exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variability. The mean seasonal water temperatures vary substantially from 29.1 degrees C in summer to 7.7 degrees C in winter, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Although the degree of spatial variability differed considerably between seasons, the water temperature generally decreases from the shallow floodplains to the main flow channels of the lake. As expected, the lake water temperature is primarily affected by the air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and the inflow temperature, whereas other factors such as cloud cover, relative humidity, precipitation, evaporation and lake topography may play a complementary role in influencing temperature. The current work presents a first attempt to use a coupled model approach, which is therefore a useful tool to investigate the water temperature behavior and its major causal factors for a large floodplain lake system. It would have implications for improving the understanding of Poyang Lake water temperature and supporting planning and management of the lake, its water quality and ecosystem functioning.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Tan, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-2853-4584; 													2072-4292					DEC	2017	9	12							1231	10.3390/rs9121231	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9121231													WOS:000419235700027
J	Barber, KE; Langdon, PG				Barber, Keith E.; Langdon, Peter G.			What drives the peat-based palaeoclimate record? A critical test using multi-proxy climate records from northern Britain	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Peatland palaeoclimate sequences produce bog surface wetness (BSW) reconstructions which are commonly interpreted as changes in summer effective precipitation, i.e. the net balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, the latter being mainly governed by temperature. The relative roles of precipitation and temperature have been investigated previously, although over centennial and millennial timescales no conclusive relationships have as yet been established, but it has been suggested that summer temperature may play the dominant role. We aimed to test this by comparing a late-Holocene peat-based palacoclimate record from Walton Moss, northern England, with a chironomid-inferred temperature (CI-T) reconstruction from a nearby lake, Talkin Tarn. Both records showed significant changes in inferred climate over the last 3000 years with lower temperatures corresponding to increases in BSW. The CI-T reconstruction, which covered the last 6000 years, was also compared to a longer BSW record, again from Walton Moss, and the same relationships were observed. Our evidence therefore suggests that over centennial timescales summer temperatures are important drivers of the peat-based palaeoclimate record. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	JOLLY, VH				JOLLY, VH			OBSERVATIONS ON SMELT RETROPINNA LACUSTRIS STOKELL	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A study was made of the smelt Retro-pinna lacustris in 2 New Zealand lakes; Lake Rotorua, the type locality of the species, and Lake Taupo, where smelt were first introduced in 1936 to serve as food for trout. Some observations on growth were also made on smelt held in hatchery ponds. Eggs collected from beach sand and hatched in a field laboratory provide some information on embryological development. Smelt were caught in the open waters by tow-nets, and from around the shores by seine net. Spawning extends from spring to autumn, and the demersal eggs are deposited in shallow water on sandy beaches or in slack water at stream mouths. The eggs hatch in 8-10 days depending on the temperature. The larval fish are approximately 2 mm in length on emergence, and are planktonic. Juvenile fish from about 15-30 mm are widely dispersed in the lakes and feed almost exclusively on planktonic Crustacea, with the addition of some algae. At about a length of 30 mm the young smelt join shoals of larger fish feeding inshore. The food of the shoaling fish was found to be very varied, but to consist mainly of insects (larval and adult stages) and of Entomostraca. Some comparative data on growth rates are given. It was found that the mean size of ripe fish in Rotorua exceeded that of Taupo, as did the maximum size (Rotorua 65 mm, Taupo 60 mm), whilst fish held in ponds attained a size of 88 mm. Four parasites were found: Saprolegnia, glochidia larvae, fluke metacercaria causing "Black Spot", and the cystercercoid stage of a cestode in the alimentary tract.																			0028-8365						1967	10	1					330	+																WOS:A19679567200024

Manipulations of stocking magnitude:: Addressing density-dependence in a juvenile cohort of common snook (Centropomus undecimalis)	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE					3rd International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and Sea Ranching	SEP 18-21, 2006	Seattle, WA					We released hatchery-reared juvenile common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) to test the effects of augmenting age-1 abundance by 100% (high augmentation, n = 2) vs 10% (low augmentation, n = 2) in estuarine creeks of southwestern Florida. We monitored in-creek abundance of age-1 snook 1 month before releases in May 2002 to estimate wild snook density and stocking magnitude. All sampling used seining standardized for effort, gear efficiency, and depletion removal. After releases, sampling continued for 1 year. After 1 month, creeks with high augmentation showed a 126% and 74% increase in total age-1 abundance, and low augmentation creeks a 6% increase and an 18% decrease. Total age-1 abundance declined during fall in all creeks, but by winter, abundance increased again, comparable to earlier levels (132% and 67% above the pre-release estimates in high augmented creeks and 8% and 5% in creeks with low augmentation). While overall density was elevated in both high augmentation creeks, hatchery-reared snook in one creek experienced a 64-85% loss within 1 month after release; loss of hatchery-reared or wild snook was negligible in other experimental creeks. Pre-release density was not a good predictor of creek productive capacity, suggesting variation in habitat production and localized recruitment. Further work is needed to understand inter-cohort density-dependent interactions, food chain responses, and variation in habitat productivity.

Episodes of forest clearings point to Neolithic cultural activities in the northern French Pre-Alps from c. 6500 cal. BP in agreement with other pollen and macrofossils records from eastern Switzerland and the Jura mountains. The lake-level record shows rises atc. 8300-8200, 6400, 5900 and after 5730 cal. BP. The rise at c. 8300-8200 cal. BP shows a tripartition. Lower water levels developed before 8300-8200 and 6665 cal. BP, at c. 6050 and 5730 cal. BP. Rises at c. 8300-8200, 6400, 5900 and after 5730 cal. BP can be related to the 8200-yr event and North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (IRD) events occurring at c. 6200, 5800 and 5500 cal. BP, respectively. Using a model based on pollen and lake-level data, the palaeoenvironmental changes reconstructed at Saint-Jorioz were translated into quantitative climate parameters. The results suggest that rises in lake level coincided with increasing annual precipitation, runoff and available moisture, and decreasing mean summer temperature and shortening of the growing season probably as a result of alternate southward/northward displacements of the Atlantic Westerly Jet. At Saint-Jorioz, the period around the 8200-yr event corresponded to a c. 2.5degreesC summer temperature cooling and a c. 130 mm P-E (precipitation-evaporation) increase in agreement with other European and marine palaeoclimate records; a c. 4degreesC summer-temperature cooling and a rise in annual precipitation by c. 175 mm are reconstructed at c. 5900 cal. BP and after 5730 cal. BP, i.e., close to the time of the North Atlantic IRD events dated at 5800 and 5500 cal. BP, and are to be tested by further investigations. A general trend toward temperature cooling and precipitation increase appears over the period documented by the sediment sequence of Saint-Jorioz possibly related to an orbitally induced reduction of summer insolation.					; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011	BEGEOT, Carole/0000-0002-3115-5844; Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466; 													0959-6836						2003	13	2					265	275		10.1191/0959683603hl612rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl612rp													WOS:000181279000010

A second step of the analysis focuses on the recovery stage in the subsequent summer. Three tourism indicators are considered: arrivals, overnight stays and length of stay. Official data on land use characteristics of 2029 villages in the Federal state of Bavaria (South Germany) are employed for the analysis. Estimations using the Spatial Durbin model combined with the Heckman selection model reveal that there is a significant relationship between the proportion of forest within as well as surrounding the village and the demand for domestic tourism compared with the 2019 baseline. There is also a significant relationship with the altitude of the surrounding areas. The importance of mountains and forests is present in both the initial year of the pandemic and in the recovery year of 2021, although the magnitude is lower in the summer of 2021. Direct and spatial effects can also be found for lakes and rivers on overnight stays and length of stay.

The continuing signs of productivity indicate a potential internal phosphorus (P) source. Internal P load, as a redox-dependent release from bottom sediments, is hard to determine in a large, relatively shallow and partially unstratified lake such as Lake Simcoe. Of the lake's three major basins, only Kempenfelt Bay stratifies long enough to develop hypoxia in the stagnant summer hypolimnion. The following indications of sediment P release are available from historic data: 1) hypolimnetic hypoxia still occurs in Kempenfelt Bay although the hypoxic factor (number of days that an area equal to the bay's surface area is overlain by water of <= 2 mg/L dissolved oxygen, DO) has decreased substantially and significantly from 15.8 d/yr (1980-1994) to 4.0 d/yr (1995-2011); 2) hypoxic factors for other lake sections and at different DO levels also indicate widespread hypoxia; 3) concentrations of redox dependent metals, Fe and Mn, increase with depth; and 4) euphotic zone P and chlorophyll concentrations increase and water clarity decreases during fall turnover. Cyanobacterial blooms appear to occur in response to internal load as supported by occasional cyanobacteria counts. These indicators provide evidence that internal loading is likely occurring and affecting the water quality in Lake Simcoe. We expect that further monitoring, specific for internal load, will corroborate these results. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Mixed-Stock Analysis of Lake Sturgeon in the Menominee River Sport Harvest and Adjoining Waters of Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Lack of information about the rates and sources of population-specific mortality and habitat use during nonspawning periods has impeded the restoration of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens. Using eight microsatellite loci and mixed-stock analyses, we estimated the proportional contributions of spawning populations from throughout the Lake Michigan basin (n = 5) to the fall sport fishery in the lower Menominee River, Wisconsin. We compared estimates of harvest composition with estimates from collections made in adjacent open-water habitats in Green Bay. The analyses revealed that 81% (90% confidence interval [CI] = 72.9-89.3%; N = 104) of harvested individuals originated from the Menominee River; all of the bycaught fish originated in adjacent streams. The harvest composition estimates differed significantly from those of open waters immediately offshore (26.7% Menominee River; 90% CI = 9.7-44.8%; N = 36) and across Green Bay (27% Menominee River; 90% CI = 19.5-34.7%; N = 214), indicating that the harvest was not a random sample from across the basin. The harvest composition estimates were not consistent with the estimates of individuals in prespawning condition (females = 50%; males = 83%), suggesting that not all of the harvested fish were staging for spring spawning. The contributions of nontargeted and numerically depressed populations to the fishery are of management concern given efforts to rehabilitate populations. Spatially restricted harvests during nonbreeding periods may not protect numerically depressed populations originating in nearby streams.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2009	29	6					1636	1643		10.1577/M08-211.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-211.1													WOS:000277113800011

In contrast, populations in subalpine lakes were characterized by an unstable age structure, large annual variation in recruitment, maximum longevity of 13 yr or more, and growth patterns that were either asymptotic, complex, or linear. Age structure and thus year-class strength was directly related to cumulative summer temperature in one subalpine lake (r = 0.71, N = 11), and in others, strong year-classes were often associated with warm summers.These analyses indicate that the magnitude of recruitment in subalpine lakes was either primarily or at least partly due to annual differences in summer temperature. Longevity was inversely related to midsummer water temperature.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1986	43	9					1733	1741		10.1139/f86-217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-217													WOS:A1986D601200006

Trace elements and major ions in atmospheric wet and dry deposition across central Illinois, USA	AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH												Measurements of trace elements and major ions in wet and dry deposition were made at eight sites in central Illinois for a 1-month period during the spring/summer season in 2011. During this study, daily-event wet deposition was collected using a commonly utilized sampling train, while 72-h dry deposition collection employed a newly developed artificial turf surrogate surface sampler designed to be more representative of natural deposition surfaces. Results showed considerable intersite variability in the amounts of wet and dry deposition received at sites. Wet deposition loadings of Hg, Pb, S, and As were higher at more southerly network sites due to higher precipitation depths and proximity to sources in the electricity generating and iron and steel manufacturing sectors. Dry deposition loadings of Hg, Pb, S, Cu, Zn, and As were higher at northerly sites, and one urban site had the highest loadings of Pb, S, Cu, and Zn consistent with its proximity (3 km) to very large sources in the electricity generating and iron and steel manufacturing sectors. Enrichment factor analysis showed moderate to high enrichment in both wet and dry deposition samples, suggesting that anthropogenic sources contributed to deposition of many trace elements measured during this study. Analysis of trace element ratios in wet and dry deposition for anthropogenically derived elements provided insight into sources impacting the study sites. Arsenic-sulfur, selenium-sulfur, and mercury-sulfate interrelationships in wet deposition suggested that regional coal combustion sources were impacting receptor sites, while relationships were less pronounced in dry deposition samples suggesting less influence from regional coal combustion sources. In addition to measurements indicating the importance of near field contributions to dry deposition, this study overall demonstrated successful application of a novel method for the direct measurement of trace elements and major ions in the dry component of atmospheric deposition, which may be considered for future studies in other similar emission source regions.

New features include: snowmelt due to rain, sediment heat transfer, formation of snow-ice, and variability in snow density, snow conductivity, and albedo. To test this model we conducted a field study of a shallow, midlatitude lake where there was no thermal stratification in winter beyond that associated with the ice and sediment interfaces. The absence of stratification allowed us to focus our attention on the heat fluxes across these interfaces rather than the details of the thermal structure within the lake. Discrepancies between held observations and model predictions are accounted for by parameter uncertainties and expected observation error. Sediment heat transfer may be important in early winter in preventing a net loss of heat from the lake water. Significant heat gains in the latter part of winter, however, are attributed to the penetration of solar radiation through the ice.

Physiological and Biochemical Response of a Hot-Spring Cyanobacterium Nostoc Sp. Strain HKAR-2 to Aluminum Toxicity	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Aluminum is an undesirable water pollutant released by water treatment plants and metal processing industries that exhibit enormous toxic effects on water bodies. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of aluminum toxicity on the physiological and biochemical behavior of a hot-spring cyanobacteriumNostocsp. strain HKAR-2. The growth of cyanobacterium was declined up to 33% by increasing aluminum concentration from 0.2 to 0.6 mM at pH 7.5 as compared to control (non-treated). However, the growth had further declined up to 87 and 92% by decreasing the pH to 6.0 and 5.0, respectively, as compared to control (pH 7.5) after 12 days of treatment. The amount of protein, chlorophyll, mycosporine-like amino acids, phycobiliproteins, extracellular and intracellular macronutrients such as phosphate and nitrate contents, and nitrate reductase activity was also declined at pH 7.5 as compared to non-treated control. In addition, aluminum also altered the sodium and potassium ions in both extracellular and intracellular environments. There was an increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbic peroxidase (APX) ranging from 58, 79, and 40%, respectively, at 0.6 mM aluminum. The increase in intracellular concentration of aluminum was directly proportional to the inhibition of cyanobacterial growth at pH 7.5. In conclusion, aluminum showed acute toxicity on the hot-spring cyanobacteriumNostocsp. strain HKAR-2, which indicates that aluminum may adversely affect the microbiota of hot-spring habitats.

Widespread prevalence of hypoxia and the classification of hypoxic conditions in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												ABS T R A C T Aquatic hypoxia within the Laurentian Great Lakes has contributed to various adverse ecological conse-quences and stimulated research interest in recent decades. An analysis of published peer-reviewed jour-nal articles from 2000 to 2020 demonstrates an increasing trend of studies related to hypoxia in the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, the majority of these studies (78%) focus on Lake Erie and in particular the well-documented hypolimnetic hypoxic conditions that develop in the central basin of Lake Erie. This hypoxic zone is relatively large (up to 1.5 million ha), has substantial ecological effects, and motivates monitoring programs and water quality improvement initiatives. Nonetheless, the hypoxic zone in the central basin of Lake Erie is only one of over twenty documented hypoxic zones in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Moreover, hypoxic conditions in the Great Lakes are quite diverse. Here, we define and char-acterize a four-fold classification of Great Lakes hypoxic conditions: 1) hypolimnetic hypoxia, 2) over-winter hypoxia, 3) diel hypoxia, and 4) episodic hypoxia. We suggest that Great Lakes research and mon-itoring programs should seek to more broadly document hypoxic conditions and develop models to pre-dict the temporal and spatial occurrence of hypoxia. Such efforts are particularly timely as future climatic conditions contributing to warmer temperatures, longer and more intense stratified periods, increased spring nutrient loading and more variable allocthonous inputs are expected to exacerbate three of the four hypoxic conditions described for the Great Lakes (hypolimnetic, diel, and episodic hypoxia).

Here we present tufa-based paleoenvironmental records from the area of NW Butana (central Sudan, similar to 55 km southeast of the Nile River) which show that increased rainfall and spring activity occurred in several discrete intervals during the last similar to 30,000 years. Lithostratigraphic data combined with phytolith, malacological, paleopedological, and stable carbon isotope records revealed humidity peaks during late MIS3 and the early and middle Holocene. Gaps in lithological records correlated with dry periods of the Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas. Minor wet pulses coinciding with Late Glacial interstadials indicate an early intensification of the African monsoon, which implies that a sharp climatic boundary existed between the Sahel and the Sahara during this period. These new paleoenvironmental records, together with archaeological evidence from Butana, provide a unique opportunity for understanding human ecology in the eastern Sahel. The peoples who inhabited this dryland area 30+ km from the Nile Valley could not rely on its relatively predictable resources of riverine, floodplain and lake habitats. New models of subsistence and settlement, and strategies of adaptations to seasonal and interannual environmental variability are needed.

American Dippers Indicate Contaminant Biotransport by Pacific Salmon	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Migrating salmon can increase productivity in Pacific Northwestern streams and lakes through the deposition of nutrients from their decomposing carcasses after spawning. Several studies also report simultaneous biotransport of persistent organic pollutants that have contaminated lake food webs, although no similar effect has been shown conclusively in rivers. We tested the prediction that salmon enhance contaminants in river food webs using the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), an aquatic songbird and a recognized indicator of stream quality. Over 3 years, we analyzed 29 dipper eggs and aquatic invertebrate samples from 14 different rivers in 10 catchments in southern British Columbia, Canada to assess whether variations in autumn spawning density of Pacific salmon were reflected in dipper egg contamination or stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. delta C-13 isotope signatures, but not delta N-15, in aquatic invertebrates and dipper eggs increased among catchments in proportion to the average density of spawning salmon. Concentrations of brominated flame retardants (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (DDTs), and chlordane compounds were related in part to the delta C-13 measure of salmon density, but mercury, chlorobenzenes, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were explained better by dipper trophic level. We conclude that spawning Pacific salmon result in the increased availability of salmon fry as dipper prey and salmon are a significant source of PBDEs, DDTs, and chlordanes to river ecosystems. However, contrary to lake studies, postspawn concentrations of legacy PCBs in river birds, even in salmon-rich rivers, were not significantly higher than would be expected from atmospheric deposition alone. We recommend using delta C-13 isotopes to trace salmon-derived lipids which may persist over winter particularly in rivers, and are potentially a better reflection of lipophilic contaminant transfer.					; Pollet, Ingrid/O-5031-2019; Ormerod, Stephen J/A-4326-2010; Ormerod, Steve/A-4326-2010	Morrissey, Christy/0000-0001-8128-4209; Pollet, Ingrid/0000-0001-7207-8294; Ormerod, Stephen J/0000-0002-8174-302X; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 17	2012	46	2					1153	1162		10.1021/es2028058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es2028058								22145949					WOS:000299136200075

The unique environmental conditions of the study region include the predominance of sedimentary carbonate and sulphate rocks, low precipitation values, and an active permafrost layer with a maximum thickness of 1.2 m. The average specific electric conductivity (EC) values for the three summer seasons in the four lakes ranged from 242 to 398 mu S cm(-1). The highest EC values were observed when the air temperature decreased and an ice cover formed (cryochemical effects). The ion composition was dominated by calcium (50.7 to 86.6%), bicarbonates (39.5 to 86.4%), and sulphate anions. The high concentrations of HCO3-, SO42-, and Ca2+ ions were attributed to the composition of the bedrock, which mainly consists of gypsum and anhydrite. The average proportion of marine components in the total load found in the Ebbadalen tundra lake waters was estimated to be 8.1%. Precipitation supplies sulphates (as much as 69-81%) and chlorides (14-36%) of nonsea origin. The chief source of these compounds may be contamination from the town of Longyearbyen. Most ions originate in the crust, the active layer of permafrost, but some are atmospheric in origin and are either transported or generated in biochemical processes. The concentrations of most components tend to increase during the summer months, reaching a maximum during freezing and partially precipitating onto the bottom sediments.

Field assessment of condition indices (nucleic acid and protein) in Mysis diluviana	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Mysis diluviana, the opossum shrimp, is a key link between offshore benthic and pelagic foodwebs in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Nucleic acid and protein indices (RNA/DNA, DNA/protein, %protein, DNA/weight), which have been related to growth and protein synthesis rates, were assessed as measures of mysid condition. We examined autumn inter-annual and spatial patterns in these metrics in juvenile and adult female M diluviana in Lake Ontario from 2001 to 2005. Males were not included because initial results of the present study indicated that larger, mature males entered a physiological decline in autumn. Nucleic acid/protein indices had a sufficient range and sensitivity to detect differences among years and habitats. In years when M diluviana was in poor condition, nucleic acid and protein indices were similar to laboratory values of animals with low growth rates, values which were slightly above the nucleic acid and protein values of fasting animals. Mysids which were deemed to be in better condition in Lake Ontario had similar condition indices to those in Lake Huron. When differences existed, inshore mysids tended to be in poorer condition than offshore mysids, supporting the hypothesis that improved food resources may encourage offshore movement of mysids during the growing season. Zooplankton areal biomass, and female % total lipids and fecundity were not correlated with the nucleic acid and protein condition indices. However, key essential fatty acids and total saturated fatty acids had significant associations with nucleic acid and protein indices; this indicates that food quality is an important determinant of condition in M. diluviana.

Evidence for early postglacial warming in Mount Field National Park, Tasmania	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Situated between the Western Pacific Warm Pool to the north and Antarctica to the south, Tasmania is an ideal location to study both postglacial and Holocene paleoclimates. Few well-dated, quantitative temperature reconstructions exist for the region so that important questions about the occurrence and magnitude of events, such as the Antarctic Cold Reversal and Younger Dryas, in Tasmania remain unanswered. Here, we provide chironomid-based reconstructions of temperature of the warmest quarter (TWARM) for two small subalpine lakes, Eagle and Platypus Tarns, Mount Field National Park. Shortly after deglaciation, TWARM reached modern values by approximately 15 000 cal a BP and remained high until 13 000 cal a BP after which temperatures began to cool steadily, reaching a minimum by 11 100-10 000 cal a BP. These results are consistent with sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from south of Tasmania but are in stark contrast to temperature inferences drawn from vegetation reconstructions based on pollen data that indicate cool initial temperatures followed by a broad warm period between 11 600-6800 cal a BP (10 000-6000 C-14 a BP). The chironomid record broadly matches the summer insolation curve whereas the vegetation record and associated climate inferences mirror winter insolation. The Antarctic Cold Reversal and Younger Dryas cold events are not evident in the chironomid-inferred temperatures, but the Antarctic Cold Reversal is evident in the loss-on-ignition curves.

Quantitative Variations of Intracellular Microcystin-LR, -RR and -YR in Samples Collected from Four Locations in Hartbeespoort Dam in North West Province (South Africa) During the 2010/2011 Summer Season	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The Hartbeespoort (HBP) Dam is a reservoir used for agricultural, domestic supply of raw potable water and recreational activities in South Africa's North-West Province. Eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms have long been a cause of water-quality problems in this reservoir. The most prevalent bloom-forming species is Microcystis aeruginosa, often producing the toxin microcystin, a hepatotoxin which can negatively impact aquatic animal and human health, and poses a problem for potable water supply. Algal samples were collected monthly from four pre-determined sites in the dam during the summer months (December 2010-March 2011). Intracellular microcystins (MCs) were extracted using SPE C-18 cartridges, followed by separation, identification and quantification using LC-ESI-MS techniques. Quantitative variation studies of MCs were conducted with respect to MC congener isolated, sampling site and month. Three main MC congeners (MC-RR, -LR and-YR) were isolated, identified and quantified. In addition, three minor MCs (MC-WR, MC-(H-4)YR and (D-Asp(3), Dha(7))MC-RR were also identified, but were not quantified. The MC dominance followed the order MC-RR>MC-LR>MC-YR across all sites and time. The maximum and minimum concentrations were 268 mu g/g and 0.14 mu g/g DW for MC-RR and MC-YR, respectively, of the total MCs quantified from this study. One-way ANOVA showed that there were no significant differences between average MC concentrations recorded across months (P = 0.62), there was, however, a marginally-significant difference in concentrations among MC congeners (P = 0.06). ANCOVA revealed a highly significant interaction between sites and MC congeners on MC concentration (P < 0.001).

An exploratory modelling study of perennial firn aquifers in the Antarctic Peninsula for the period 1979-2016	CRYOSPHERE												In this study, we focus on the model detection in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) of so-called perennial firn aquifers (PFAs) that are widespread in Greenland and Svalbard and are formed when surface meltwater percolates into the firn pack in summer, which is then buried by snowfall and does not refreeze during the following winter. We use two snow models, the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research Utrecht Firn Densification Model (IMAU-FDM) and SNOWPACK, and force these (partly) with mass and energy fluxes from the Regional Atmospheric Climate MOdel (RACMO2.3p2) to construct a 1979-2016 climatology of AP firn density, temperature, and liquid water content. An evaluation using 75 snow temperature observations at 10 m depth and density profiles from 11 firn cores shows that output of both snow models is sufficiently realistic to warrant further analysis of firn characteristics. The models give comparable results: in 941 model grid points in either model, covering similar to 28 000 km(2), PFAs existed for at least 1 year in the simulated period, most notably in the western AR. At these locations, surface meltwater production typically exceeds 200 mm w e yr(-1), with accumulation for most locations > 1000mm w e yr(-1). Most persistent and extensive are PFAs modelled on and around Wilkins Ice Shelf. Here, both meltwater production and accumulation rates are sufficiently high to sustain a PFA on 49 % of the ice shelf area in (up to) 100 % (depending on the model) of the years in the 1979-2016 period. Although this PFA presence is confirmed by recent observations, its extent in the models appears underestimated. Other notable PFA locations are Wordie Ice Shelf, an ice shelf that has almost completely disappeared in recent decades, and the relatively warm north-western side of mountain ranges in Palmer Land, where accumulation rates can be extremely high, and PFAs are formed frequently. PFAs are not necessarily more frequent in areas with the largest melt and accumulation rates, but they do grow larger and retain more meltwater, which could increase the likelihood of ice shelf hydrofracturing. We find that not only the magnitude of melt and accumulation is important but also the timing of precipitation events relative to melt events. Large accumulation events that occur in the months following an above-average summer melt event favour PFA formation in that year. Most PFAs are predicted near the grounding lines of the (former) Prince Gustav, Wilkins, and Wordie ice shelves. This highlights the need to further investigate how PFAs may impact ice shelf disintegration events through the process of hydrofracturing in a similar way as supraglacial lakes do.

The most visible result of excessive eutrophication is rapidly deteriorating transparency of waters in the summer which is caused by rapid development of planktonic algae. Another symptom of this process is gradual overgrowth of water reservoirs and watercourses by macrophytes. Hence, in order to improve the quality of water in these lakes the renovation treatment is applied. Lakes restoration can be made in many ways: physical, chemical and biological. The chemical and physical methods of lakes restoration are invasive and controversial. However, one of the relatively not invasive methods of lakes restoration is ecological biomanipulation. The goal of biomanipulation is to reduce the concentration of harmful phytoplankton, by the stocking of predatory fish triggers a trophic cascade with decreases in the biomass of smaller-bodied fish, e.g. cyprinids, increases in the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton, and decreases in the biomass of harmful phytoplankton. In some cases plankton-eating fish have been removed directly by lake managers. In addition, the removal of bottom-feeding fish from shallow lakes leads to increases in rooted vegetation and increased water clarity as the rooted plants stabilize the sediments. This transition involves a trophic cascade, as herbivorous zooplankton increase in biomass and consume phytoplankton, but also involves the direct effects of rooted vegetation on sediment stability and nutrient cycling. The most frequent cause of fast eutrophication is the runoff of untreated sewage directly into the waters of lakes and rivers or the excessive runoff of biogenic compounds from agricultural catchment areas. Forest lakes because of far distance from agglomeration and agricultural areas are in lesser extent exposed on the human pressure. Generally, one unfavorable variable affected these lakes is angling pressure. Thus, due to the lack of pollution and the relative stabilization of the mid-forest lakes they are a good place to conduct the ecological biomanipulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the short-term biomanipulation effectiveness in three shallow forest lakes. Bi-manipulation was performed by stocking in 2012 to these lakes a summer fry of pike (200 ind. ha(-1)) and zander (150 ind. ha(-1)). Before the biomanipulation (in 2011) a control study of physic-chemical parameters, ichthyofauna and zooplankton composition were made. After the biomanipulation (in 2014) the same control study were conducted. Before and after the biomanipulation period significant changes in values of physic-chemical variables were not observed. Similarly, a slight changes in ichthyofauna composition between these two period occurred. The roach and bream were the biomass dominants. Only the zooplankton composition obtained pronounced changes, but statistically not significant. The most visible differences in zooplankton abundance concerned cladocerans - group that the most affect the phytoplankton decreasing. After the biomanipulation abundance of cladocerans increased from 31% to 67%. According to the results, it can be concluded that the biomanipulation time in study lakes was too short to make significant changes. To get a better effect of biomanipulation a successive stocking with summer or autumn fry of pike and zander should be conducted, even in 1000 ind. ha(-1). Finally, we can assume that in the forest, shallow, highly eutrophic lakes a biomanipulation with predatory fish may be sufficient for their effective restoration.

J	Fu, CS; Yao, HX				Fu, Congsheng; Yao, Huaxia			Trends of ice breakup date in south-central Ontario	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Large-scale ice phenology studies have revealed overall patterns of later freeze, earlier breakup, and shorter duration of ice in the Northern Hemisphere. However, there have been few studies regarding the trends, including their spatial patterns, in ice phenology for individual waterbodies on a local or small regional scale, although the coherence of ice phenology has been shown to decline rapidly in the first few hundred kilometers. In this study, we extracted trends, analyzed affecting factors, and investigated relevant spatial patterns for ice breakup date time series at 10 locations with record length 90years in south-central Ontario, Canada. Wavelet methods, including the multiresolution analysis (MRA) method for nonlinear trend extraction and the wavelet coherence (WTC) method for identifying the teleconnections between large-scale climate modes and ice breakup date, are proved to be effective in ice phenology analysis. Using MRA method, the overall trend of ice breakup date time series (1905-1991) varied from earlier ice breakup to later ice breakup, then to earlier breakup again from south to north in south-central Ontario. Ice breakup date is closely correlated with air temperature during certain winter/spring months, as well as the last day with snow on the ground and number of snow-on-ground days. The influences of solar activity and Pacific North American on ice breakup were comparatively uniform across south-central Ontario, while those of El Nino-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Arctic Oscillation on ice phenology changed with distance of 50-100km in the north-south direction.

EOC constituted up to 99.9% (minimum 30.5%, mean 65.9%) of the phytoplankton's primary production. EOC quality seemed to be decisive for uptake as a carbon source utilized first by aquatic bacteria. In early summer, EOC were rapidly incorporated by microorganisms and represented an important contribution to their biomass production. In contrast, the exudates released during late summer (August and September) predominantly consisted of components slowly incorporated by bacteria. These exudates were compounds of presumably high molecular weight.

The robust chronology of the presented record is based on varve counting and AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant macro-remains. In addition to the qualitative interpretation of the pollen data, we provide quantitative reconstructions of vegetation and climate based on the method of biomization and weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) technique, respectively. Power spectra were computed to investigate the frequency domain distribution of proxy signals and potential natural periodicities. Pollen assemblages, pollen-derived biome scores and climate variables as well as the cyclicity pattern indicate that NE China experienced significant changes in temperature and moisture conditions during the Holocene. Within the earliest phase of the Holocene, a large-scale reorganization of vegetation occurred, reflecting the reconstructed shift towards higher temperatures and precipitation values and the initial Holocene strengthening and northward expansion of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Afterwards, summer temperatures remain at a high level, whereas the reconstructed precipitation shows an increasing trend until approximately 4000 cal. yr BP. Since 3500 cal. yr BP, temperature and precipitation values decline, indicating moderate cooling and weakening of the EASM. A distinct periodicity of 550-600 years and evidence of a Mid Holocene transition from a temperature-triggered to a predominantly moisture-triggered climate regime are derived from the power spectra analysis. The results obtained from SHL are largely consistent with other palaeoenvironmental records from NE China, substantiating the regional nature of the reconstructed vegetation and climate patterns. However, the reconstructed climate changes contrast with the moisture evolution recorded in S China and the mid-latitude (semi-)arid regions of N China. Whereas a clear insolation-related trend of monsoon intensity over the Holocene is lacking from the SHL record, variations in the coupled atmosphere-Pacific Ocean system can largely explain the reconstructed changes in NE China.

J	Peeters, F; Livingstone, DM; Goudsmit, GH; Kipfer, R; Forster, R				Peeters, F; Livingstone, DM; Goudsmit, GH; Kipfer, R; Forster, R			Modeling 50 years of historical temperature profiles in a large central European lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A unique data set of 50 years of monthly temperature profiles from Lake Zurich, a normally ice-free lake located on the Swiss Plateau, allowed the one-dimensional numerical k-epsilon lake model "SIMSTRAT" to be calibrated (19481957) and validated (1958-1997). Hindcasts of temperature profiles agree excellently with the measured data. Both interannual and intraannual variations in thermal structure are reproduced well during the entire 50-yr simulation, thus demonstrating the stability and good prognostic qualities of the model. Simulations conducted with raised and lowered air temperatures (T(air)) suggest that an increase in T(air) will lead to an increase in lake water temperature at all depths. In comparison to the continuous modeling approach taken in this study, the commonly employed discontinuous modeling approach (with no heat carryover during winter) substantially underestimated the degree of long-term hypolimnetic warming that can be expected to result from an increase in T(air). Thus, whereas the discontinuous approach yields valid predictions for strictly dimictic lakes that are ice-covered each winter, heat carryover during winter makes a continuous approach necessary in lakes like Lake Zurich that are only facultatively dimictic. The significant degree of hypolimnetic warming found in this study suggests that the response of facultatively dimictic lakes to increases in T(air) is likely to differ from that of the strictly dimictic lakes modeled in other investigations. In Lake Zurich, an increase in T(air), is predicted to result in more frequent suppression of deeply penetrative winter mixing events, with a potentially negative impact on the lake ecosystem.																			0024-3590					JAN	2002	47	1					186	197		10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0186	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0186													WOS:000173529200018

However, when such species hybridize, migratory traits from parental species can combine maladaptively and cause hybrids to fall between parental fitness peaks, with potential consequences for hybrid viability and species integrity. Here, we take advantage of a natural cross-breeding incident to study migratory behaviour in naturally occurring hybrids as well as in their parental species and explore links between migratory traits and predation risk. To achieve this, we used electronic tags and passive telemetry to record detailed individual migration patterns (timing and number of migratory trips) in two common freshwater fish species, roachRutilus rutilus, common breamAbramis bramaas well as their hybrids. Next, we scanned for tags regurgitated by a key avian predator (great cormorantPhalacrocorax carbo) at nearby roosting sites, allowing us to directly link migratory behaviour to predation risk in the wild. We found that hybrid individuals showed a higher number of short, multi-trip movements between lake and stream habitats as compared to both parental species. The mean date of first lake departure differed between bream and roach by more than 10 days, while hybrids departed in two distinct peaks that overlapped with the parental species' averages. Moreover, the probability of cormorant predation increased with multi-trip movement frequency across species and was higher for hybrids. Our data provide novel insights into hybrid viability, with links to predator-mediated ecological selection. Increased exposure to predators via maladaptive migratory behaviour reduces hybrid survival and can thereby reinforce species integrity.					; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Pärssinen, Varpu/M-3552-2018; Parssinen, Varpu/M-3552-2018	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Parssinen, Varpu/0000-0002-9189-9765													0021-8790	1365-2656				NOV	2020	89	11					2596	2604		10.1111/1365-2656.13308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13308		AUG 2020						32745243					WOS:000562458000001
J	Wilson, GC; McCausland, PJA				Wilson, Graham C.; McCausland, Phil J. A.			Canadian meteorites: a brief review	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We present a brief overview of Canadian meteorites with a focus on noting significant recent falls, finds, and research developments. To date, 60 Canadian meteorites have received official international recognition from the Nomenclature Committee of the Meteoritical Society, while at least 13 more are "in process" for submission to the Meteoritical Bulletin, that organization's official database of the world's meteorites. The 60 meteorites (44 finds and 16 falls since the recognition of the Madoc iron in 1854) include 25 irons, 3 pallasite stony-irons, and 32 stony meteorites. The latter include 14, 11 and 3 H, L and LL chondrites, 2 carbonaceous chondrites and 2 enstatite chondrites, but no achondrites. The most intensively researched meteorites are Tagish Lake (C2 ungrouped) and Abee (EH5), followed by Bruderheim (L6) and Springwater (pallasite). Bruderheim, a 1960 fall, is widely distributed, being the most massive reported Canadian meteorite at 303 kg total known weight (TKW). Seven Canadian meteorites exceed 100 kg TKW, 36 are between 1 and 50 kg, and 17 are <1 kg. Recent years have seen the addition of the Tagish Lake, Buzzard Coulee and Grimsby meteorite falls, all of which have well-determined fireball trajectories and therefore well-known orbits, a striking Canadian addition to the handful that are known worldwide. The discovery of the Holocene Whitecourt iron impact crater is similarly a significant recent development in understanding the impactor flux. The lessons learned on meteorites can be applied to newly recovered samples from the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and comets.																			0008-4077					JAN	2013	50	1					4	13		10.1139/E2012-036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E2012-036													WOS:000315106800002
J	Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF				Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF			Chlorophyll response to nutrients and non-algal seston in Missouri reservoirs and oxbow lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												When unaggregated summer chlorophyll data (Chl) from 184 Missouri reservoirs are plotted against total phosphorus (TP) a 'bow' in the distribution develops among a group of points with low Chl:TP ratios (averaging < 0.05). Low Chl:TP is mostly associated with turbid, nutrient-rich inflows in reservoirs across the entire trophic range. Non-algal seston (NAS) is our best metric of these inflows and is a co-variable in Chl-TP regressions. This influence is most prominent in years of high runoff and is distinctly seasonal, being most prevalent in early summer prior to full stratification. In late summer, inflows typically enter as subsurface density currents, and nitrogen accounts for more variation in Chl-TP than NAS. Neither variable, however, greatly influences the long-term relation between Chl and TP, which is linear, relatively consistent, and matches the global pattern. In several oxbow lakes, high NAS caused by sediment resuspension is a chronic condition; it seems neither light nor flushing greatly influence Chl:TP in these shallow systems, and values approximate the statewide average. Temporal variation in Chl:TP is demonstrated by daily samples (n=1676) from a single reservoir, with average variability, that covers about 94% of the statewide Chl and about a third of the TP range. The Chl-TP pattern in over half of Missouri reservoirs deviates somewhat from predictions based on cross-system regression models. Nonetheless, for 97% of the study reservoirs, long-term Chl is within a factor of two above or below model predictions, and most are within +/- 25%. Such differences are modest when compared to the temporal variation measured in an intensively studied reservoir.																			1040-2381					SEP	2005	21	3					361	371		10.1080/07438140509354441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354441													WOS:000232563600010

In Lake Nieuwe Meer the water column is stratified in summer. Microcystis can stay in the euphotic zone due to its buoyancy. Deep mixing of the lake abolishes this advantage of buoyancy of Microcystis and favours non-buoyant algae as they will have a reduced sedimentation loss. The technique of artificial mixing has been applied in 1993 and 1994 applied in Lake Nieuwe Meer in order to reduce the growth of Microcystis. The application was successful: there has been no nuisance due to Microcystis scums. The percentage cyanobacteria of the total phytoplankton in summer decreased from +/-90% without mixing to less than 5% with mixing. Characteristics of the equipment used for destratification are presented.					; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025	Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; 													0273-1223						1995	31	8					245	248		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00377-Y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00377-Y													WOS:A1995RL89100031

However, this is proving to be unfeasible over large areas. The use of remote sensing is increasingly encouraged but covering the full range of ecological variables by such datasets and ensuring compatibility with the traditional assessment methodology has not been achieved yet. We aimed to test Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as a source for mapping all variables required by the local official conservation status assessment scheme and to develop an automated method that calculates Natura 2000 conservation status at 0.5 m raster resolution for 24 km(2) of Pannonic Salt Steppe habitat (code 1530). We used multi-temporal (summer and winter) ALS point clouds with full-waveform recording and a density of 10 pt/m(2). Some required variables were derived from ALS product rasters; others involved vegetation classification layers calculated by machine learning and fuzzy categorization. Thresholds separating favorable and unfavorable values of each variable required by the national assessment scheme were manually calibrated from 10 plots where field-based assessment was carried out. Rasters representing positive and negative scores for each input variable were integrated in a ruleset that exactly follows the Hungarian Natura 2000 assessment scheme for grasslands. Accuracy of each parameter and the final conservation status score and category was evaluated by 10 independent assessment plots. We conclude that ALS is a suitable data source for Natura 2000 assessments in grasslands, and that the national grassland assessment scheme can successfully be used as a GIS processing model for conservation status, ensuring that the output is directly comparable with traditional field based assessments.

J	HARMAN, WN				HARMAN, WN			EFFECTS OF SIMAZINE ON MOLLUSCAN FAUNA OF MORIANE LAKE, NEW-YORK	NAUTILUS												The CIBA-Geigy Chemical Company treated Moriane Lake, Madison County, New York, [USA] with Simazine (Princep 80W, or Aquazine 80W) [2-chloro-1,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine] to control undesirable blue-green algal populations in 1974 and 1975. The effects of these treatments on the benthic fauna was determined. The lake was not completely satisfactory for the analysis because typical benthic communities were not present, possibly because of previous applications of CuSO4 and Diquat (1,1''-ethylene-2,2''-depyridylium dibromide). Simazine applications theoretically equalling concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 ppmw after dispersal throughout the epilimnion did not have an important effect on profundal arthropod (Diptera: Chironomidae) biomass. Applications of 0.5 ppmw (after dispersal throughout the epilimnion) did have debilitating effects on littoral molluscs. Populations of Goniobasis livescens (Menke), that normally reproduce throughout the summer, recovered by the spring following treatment. Simazine applications of 0.5 ppmw had severely debilitating effects on sublittoral populations of Viviparus georigianus (Lea), killing most immature individuals. At concentrations of 0.25 ppmw populations were not as affected because newly born snails did not sustain high mortality. Short term toxicity tests conducted in the laboratory resulted in no mollusc mortality in concentrations of Simazine up to 5.0 ppmw. Synergistic reactions with dying algal cells were responsible for in situ mortality of these prosobranch gastropods.																			0028-1344						1978	92	3					129	134																WOS:A1978FG18300010
J	Vandekerkhove, E; Bertrand, S; Reid, B; Bartels, A; Charlier, B				Vandekerkhove, Elke; Bertrand, Sebastien; Reid, Brian; Bartels, Astrid; Charlier, Bernard			Sources of dissolved silica to the fjords of northern Patagonia (44-48°S): the importance of volcanic ash soil distribution and weathering	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Dissolved silica (DSi) plays an important biogeochemical role in the fjords of northern Chilean Patagonia (44-48 degrees S), where it drives high biogenic productivity and promotes carbon burial. It is generally believed that the DSi riverine input to lakes and coastal environments is controlled by a combination of factors including lithology, climate, topography, vegetation, and meltwater input. In northern Chilean Patagonia several authors have proposed that the postglacial volcanic ash soils (andosols) may play a significant role in the high supply of DSi to the regional fjords. To assess the influence of andosols on DSi concentrations in north Patagonian rivers, we mapped andosol thickness and compared our results with river chemistry. The mineralogical and geochemical composition of three representative andosol profiles was also examined to evaluate the efficiency of weathering processes. The andosol thickness map clearly demonstrates that volcanic ash was predominantly deposited on the eastern side of the regional volcanoes, reflecting the influence of the prevailing westerly winds on the distribution of pyroclastic material. Mineralogical and geochemical results show that the andosol parent material has the typical andesitic basaltic signature of the regional volcanoes, i.e. high amounts of amorphous material, plagioclase, K-feldspar, and pyroxene. Down-profile variations in soil mineralogy and geochemistry indicate increased leaching of silica with depth, resulting from weathering of the volcanic parent material. For the five studied watersheds, a highly positive correlation (R-2=0.98) was found between average andosol thickness and DSi concentrations, suggesting that andosol thickness is the main parameter affecting DSi concentrations in north Patagonian river systems. On seasonal timescales, increased precipitation (winter) and glacial meltwater (summer) input can significantly reduce DSi concentrations. We argue that the weathering of andosols constitutes the most important source of DSi to the lakes and fjords of northern Chilean Patagonia, explaining the particularly high regional rates of biogenic silica production.

J	Hansson, LA				Hansson, LA			Plasticity in pigmentation induced by conflicting threats from predation and UV radiation	ECOLOGY												In a variable and unpredictable environment, phenotypic plasticity in morphology or behavior may considerably improve an organism's protection against environmental threats and thereby its fitness. Here I demonstrate that common freshwater organisms, copepods (Crustacea), show a plastic response by adjusting pigmentation level in relation to two environmental threats: ultraviolet radiation (UV) and predation. The red pigment in copepods, astaxanthin, reduces damage caused by UV radiation, but makes the organism more conspicuous, thereby exposing it to higher predation pressure. In a field survey of six lakes sampled monthly for 16 mo, I quantified UV and predation threat, as well as copepod pigmentation level. The relative threat ratio (UV/predation) was generally lowest during summer and highest during spring; this pattern was paralleled by pigmentation level among copepods. Moreover, the level of pigmentation among copepods in lakes with high predation pressure was lower than among those copepods in lakes with lower risk of predation. In a complementary experimental study performed under constant UV threat, calanoid copepods in the absence of predation threat responded with almost three times higher pigment levels, compared to those with fish present (caged). Hence, the correlative field survey and the mechanistic experiment together suggest that the level of pigmentation in copepods is an inducible and adjustable defense, governed by the aim to improve individual protection against prevailing threats from both predation and UV radiation.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	2004	85	4					1005	1016		10.1890/02-0525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0525													WOS:000220766600012

The zooplankton of Lake Verevi is characteristic of hypertrophic lakes, with a small number of dominant species, rotifers being the main ones, and juveniles prevailing among copepods. In 1999-2001, the average abundance of metazooplankton in the lake was 1570 X 103 ind m(-3); in the epilimnion 2320 x 103 ind m(-3), in the metalimnion 2178 x 103 ind m(-3), and in the hypolimnion 237 x 10(3) ind m(-3). The average biomass of metazooplankton was 1.75 g m(-3); in the epi-, meta- and hypolimnion, accordingly, 2.16, 2.85 and 0.26 g m(-3). The highest abundances 19,136 x 103 ind m(-3) and 12,008 x 103 ind m(-3) - were registered in the lower half of the metalimnion in 24 May and 5 June 2001, respectively. Rotifer Keratella cochlearis f. typica (Gosse, 1851) was the dominating species in abundance. In biomass, Asplanchna priodonta Gosse, 1850, among the rotifers, and Eudiaptomus graciloides (Lilljeborg, 1888), among the copepods, dominated. According to the data from 2000-2001, the abundance and biomass of both copepods and rotifers were highest in spring. Zooplankton was scarce in the hypolimnion, and no peaks were observed there. During the summers of 1998 and 1999, when thermal stratification was particularly strong, zooplankton was the most abundant in the upper half of the metalimnion, and a distinct peak of biomass occurred in the second fourth of the metalimnion. Probably, the main factors affecting the vertical distribution of zooplankton in L. Verevi are fish, Chaoborus larvae, and chemocline, while food, like phytoplankton, composition and abundance may affect more the seasonal development of zooplankton.					; Agasild, Helen/AGG-7498-2022; Virro, Taavi/F-2253-2018	Ott, Ingmar/0000-0002-9036-1736; Agasild, Helen/0000-0002-4926-9807													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2005	547						151	162		10.1007/s10750-005-4156-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4156-8													WOS:000232760300014

Quaternary sediments cover the carbonate aquifers, and at places with less than 15 m of Quaternary sediments, the aquifers, springs, and adjacent ecotones are especially vulnerable to contamination. The near-surface situated chalk and limestones are related to thin Quaternary sediment cover and karst features (springs, lakes, disappearing streams, caves, dolines). This paper categorizes the various observed karstic features into geological, hydrogeological, and structural settings of the chalk and limestone types that are important for management of this important groundwater resource in Denmark.																			2511-2066	2511-2082	978-3-319-51070-5; 978-3-319-51069-9				2018							289	298		10.1007/978-3-319-51070-5_34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51070-5_34													WOS:000444870500035

Andrew G.; Smith, Alan			Marginal marine spring carbonates defining an emergent rocky shoreline at Cape Freycinet, Western Australia	MARINE GEOLOGY												Modern and Holocene tufa microbialites have been documented globally on groundwater spring-fed supratidal rock coasts. Here, we document the first emergent facies assemblage and demonstrate its utility as a palaeoshoreline (and sea-level) indicator. At Cape Freycinet, Western Australia, discrete palaeo-spring-associated deposits comprise five distinct facies that collectively define a Quaternary shoreline on a granitic rock coast similar to the contemporary coast. A palaeosol facies, passes laterally seaward into tufa microbialite on sub-horizontal bedrock, associated with oncoids. The most seaward facies is a microbially-cemented sand representing deposition in the upper-intertidal to supratidal zone of a sandy embayed beach, flanked by prominent headlands. A tufa-lithoclast breccia indicates occasional high-energy events. Facies distributions are controlled by bedrock topography in relation to palaeo-sea-level and the distinct suite of marginal marine, springline-associated facies define a Quaternary palaeo-shoreline at ca. +13 m above sea-level. The approach demonstrates the utility of marginal marine microbialite and related carbonate deposits as indicators of Quaternary sea-level on rock coasts.

Plant biomass, species richness, and species diversity all were lower in grazed areas compared to non-grazed exclosures.

J	Murray, CD; Buttle, JM				Murray, CD; Buttle, JM			Impacts of clearcut harvesting on snow accumulation and melt in a northern hardwood forest	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Snow accumulation and melt on north-and south-facing slopes in the Turkey lakes watershed (TLW) in central Ontario were compared for a mature hardwood maple stand and an adjacent clearcut in late winter and spring of 2000 and 2001. Snow accumulation in the clearcut exceeded that in the forest, although the degree of difference varied with slope aspect and year. Melt was significantly larger in the south-facing clearcut and forest relative to corresponding north-facing sites. The south-facing forest sites lost all snowcover 27 days before the north-facing clearcut in 2000, and 4 days before the north-facing clearcut in 2001. Daily melt in the clearcut was slightly greater and more spatially variable than in the adjacent forest, with the exception of the south-facing slope in 2000. Nevertheless, the effect of aspect on spatial variations in melt was larger than that due to clearcutting. There was a slight increase in melt rate with decreased canopy density in the south-facing clearcut and forest; however, variations in canopy density did not explain inter-point differences in daily melt within either the north-facing clearcut or the forest. The hydrological consequences of greater pre-melt snow water equivalent and larger daily melt in clearcuts include quicker delivery of meltwater to the soil surface and promotion of rapid near-surface runoff to receiving waters relative to undisturbed forest stands at TLW.

Modeling ground thermal conditions and the limit of permafrost within the nearshore zone of the Mackenzie Delta, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												This study examines the interrelated effects of snow and ice on ground thermal conditions beneath regions of shallow water within the nearshore zone of the Mackenzie Delta. Field-and model-based data were used to determine the thermal boundary conditions at the sediment bed surface and to define the contemporary limit of permafrost. Over two consecutive winters, mean sediment bed temperatures deviated up to 9.8 degrees C beneath bottom-fast ice that ranged from 10 cm to 100 cm thick, with intrasite variability as much as 4.7 degrees C. Measured and modeled temperatures were found to exponentially relate to the duration of time ice is bottom-fast with the sediment bed. Mean winter ground temperatures at this boundary were predicted within +/- 0.25 degrees C of the observed measurements using numerical thermal modeling. As on-ice snow depth decreased, the limit of equilibrium permafrost shifted toward progressively deeper water because of longer durations of ice contact and greater heat loss from the ground. The critical water depth for permafrost under equilibrium conditions was 84 cm (calculated from an ice thickness of 93 cm), which is equivalent to an ice contact time of 142 days. Equilibrium permafrost was mapped beneath 393.8 km(2) of bottom-fast ice. An additional 387.9 km(2) exhibited seasonal ground freezing in the winter of 2006-2007. Areas affected by bottom-fast ice represent locations that are actively receiving sediment from distributary channels. These results provide the first estimates of contemporary permafrost distribution for shallow water regions of the outer Mackenzie Delta.

However, the unique morphology of reservoirs can create suitable conditions for excessive algae growth and associated cyanobacteria blooms in shallow in -flow reservoir locations by providing warm water environments with relatively high nutrient in -puts, deposition, and nutrient storage. Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) are costly water management issues and bloom recurrence is associated with economic costs and negative impacts to human, animal, and environ-mental health. As cyanoHAB occurrence varies substantially within different regions of a water body, understanding in-lake cyanoHAB spatial dynamics is essential to guide reservoir monitoring and mitigate potential public exposure to cyanotoxins. Cloud-based computational processing power and high temporal frequency of satellites enables advanced pixel-based spatial analysis of cyanoHAB frequency and quantitative assessment of reservoir headwater in-flows compared to near-dam surface waters of individual reservoirs. Additionally, extensive spatial coverage of sat-ellite imagery allows for evaluation of spatial trends across many dozens of reservoir sites. Surface water cyanobacteria concentrations for sixty reservoirs in the southern U.S. were estimated using 300 m resolution European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite sensor for a five year period (May 2016-April 2021). Of the reservoirs studied, spatial analysis of OLCI data revealed 98% had more frequent cyanoHAB occurrence above the con-centration of >100,000 cells/mL in headwaters compared to near-dam surface waters (P < 0.001). Headwaters exhibited greater seasonal variability with more frequent and higher magnitude cyanoHABs occurring mid-summer to fall. Examination of reservoirs identified extremely high concentration cyanobacteria events (>1,000,000 cells/mL) occurring in 70% of headwater locations while only 30% of near-dam locations exceeded this threshold. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests of cyanoHAB magnitudes using paired-observations (dates with observations in both a reservoir's headwater and near-dam locations) confirmed significantly higher concentrations in headwater versus near-dam locations (p < 0.001).

Compared to the widely studied East Asian summer monsoon, the behavior of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) in the Pliocene is still not well known. Here, we present new high-resolution geochemical (Rb/Sr and Ti) data from the lacustrine Yuanmou Basin (Southwest China) spanning the Pliocene to early Pleistocene (4.30-2.0 Ma) that permit detailed analysis of hydroclimate changes related to orbital-scale SASM variability. We find a clear weakening of the SASM at 2.9-2.75 Ma, which may be related to warming in the high-latitude southern hemisphere and a weakening of atmospheric circulation at low latitudes over the Indian Ocean. Our results highlight that 405- and 100-Kyr eccentricity forcing had a dominant role in driving climate change in the Yuanmou Basin during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Based on analysis of our data from the Yuanmou Basin, coupled with marine data from the Arabian Sea, we suggest that orbital-scale SASM variability during the Pliocene was mainly controlled by changes in low-latitude insolation. In addition, oscillations of the West Antarctic ice sheet after & SIM;3.5 Ma also significantly influenced the evolution of the SASM on orbital time scales. Orbital-scale South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) variability remains largely unknown in the pre-Quaternary due to a paucity of high temporal resolution marine and terrestrial records describing the evolution of the SASM. Here, we present a new high-resolution record of climate from lake sediments spanning the mid-Pliocene to early Pleistocene. We show that the evolution of the SASM at 4.30-2.0 Ma is mainly controlled by low-latitude solar radiation changes controlled by cyclic changes in Earth's eccentricity. Combining previous marine and continental records, we find a significant weakening of the SASM at 2.9-2.75 Ma, which may be due to a weakening of the trans-equatorial pressure gradient caused by anomalous warming at high latitudes in the southern hemisphere. At the same time, a weakening of atmospheric circulation over the Indian Ocean may also have been responsible for the weakening of the SASM during this period. Orbital-scale South Asian monsoon evolution in the Pliocene was mainly influenced by low-latitude insolationOscillations of the West Antarctic ice sheet after & SIM;3.5 Ma also influenced evolution of South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) on orbital time scalesCombined low- and high-latitude processes caused weakening of the SASM at 2.9-2.75 Ma					Zhang, Ze/LLK-7271-2024; Cao, Mengmeng/JFA-9946-2023; Kemp, David/D-7288-2012														2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2023	128	18							e2023JD039057	10.1029/2023JD039057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039057													WOS:001066325000001

Rates, processes and morphology of freshwater calving at Miage Glacier (Italian Alps)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Symposium on the Contribution from Glaciers and Snow Cover to Runoff from Mountains in Different Climates	APR 04-09, 2005	Foz do Iguacu, BRAZIL	Int Assoc of Hydrol Sci, Int Commis on Snow and Ice				The rates and processes of freshwater calving at Miage Glacier (Mont Blanc Massif. Italy) are described. Calving at Miage Glacier has occurred for two centuries on its right-lateral side. into a small ice-marginal lake (Miage Lake). Field surveys identified the main processes leading to iceberg production and quantified the calving losses over a summer season. Calving losses were compared (1) With the Surface ablation of the debris-covered tongue. evaluated through a simple model based on measured ablation rates at different altitudes and debris cover thicknesses. and (2) with other inputs to the lake (stream inflow discharge) and with the lake volume. Results show that thermal undercutting by warmer surface water plays an important role in driving ice-cliff evolution. Thermal notches grow at similar to 30-35m year(-1) and cause a similar amount of cliff retreat. Calving, contributes similar to 2% of the estimated summer runoff from the debris-covered part of the ablation zone, but this is equivalent to similar to 38% of the lake volume. and is of the same magnitude as the mean discharge from the inflow streams. These data indicate that calving of the ice cliff is one of the main water sources for maintaining the lake at the maximum Summer volume. with the surface at the level of the subaerial outlet stream. A survey of Italian calving glaciers shows that calving is becoming more widespread, and that debris covers are present at all calving ice margins. The lake-ice interactions described in this study can. therefore, be considered to have wider representativeness. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

J	Solarski, M; Rzetala, M				Solarski, Maksymilian; Rzetala, Mariusz			Determinants of Spatial Variability of Ice Thickness in Lakes in High Mountains of the Temperate Zone-The Case of the Tatra Mountains	WATER												Vertical and horizontal variation in the ice cover of mountain lakes in the temperate climate zone has not been thoroughly studied. The study concerned ice phenomena in four lakes located in the Tatra National Park in the Tatra Mountains (the Czarny Staw Gasienicowy, Czarny Staw pod Rysami, Morskie Oko, and Smreczynski Staw). The research, which was conducted in the 2018/2019 winter season, included an analysis of variability in atmospheric conditions, an analysis of presence of ice phenomena on satellite images, field work (measurements of ice layer and of snow and slush layer thickness were conducted at a total of 151 sites), and statistical analyses. It was determined that negative air temperature was just one factor among those that determined the maximum thickness of the ice forming on lakes in high mountains. It was found that in addition to ambient thermal conditions, a major factor affecting the magnitude of variation in lake ice thickness was the thickness of the snow overlying the ice and its spatial variability. Thicker ice cover tended to form in areas where a thick layer of snow was deposited. The decisive factor that contributed to a significant variation in ice thickness between lakes was the uneven accretion of snow ice from above. The maximum ice thickness values modeled using Stefan's formula were significantly underestimated (accounting for 38-61% of the ice thickness measured) relative to the highest ice thickness values found empirically at the end of the winter season. Study results fill a gap in our knowledge and methodology related to vertical and horizontal variation in the ice cover of mountain lakes; they also have significant applications, indicating the risk of winter use of water bodies with different ice cover structure, thickness, and extent.

Metals in surface water of Ukraine: the migration forms, features of distribution between the abiotic components of aquatic ecosystems, and potential bioavailability	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												We have generalized the results of long-term studies of coexisting forms of a series of metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Mo, Cd, and V) in surface water bodies of Ukraine, differing in the hydrological regime and the water chemical composition (rivers, reservoirs, lakes, and ponds). The studied metals content has ranged widely, the concentrations of aluminum, iron, and manganese being typically the highest, and the concentration of molybdenum, vanadium, and cadmium being typically the lowest. The ratio between the suspended and the dissolved forms of the metals has been established. Iron and aluminum migrate mostly as part of the suspended matter, whereas the other metals mainly migrate in the dissolved state. The dissolved manganese form predominates in the water bodies under anaerobic conditions. Copper and molybdenum are present almost always in the dissolved state, regardless of the water body type. The data on the relative content of the labile metal fraction (potentially toxic to aquatic organisms) are reported. The relatively low content of this fraction has been found to be majorly owing to the metal ions complexing with natural organic ligands. The humic compounds, the most widespread group of natural organic compounds, play the primary role in the complexation. Even metals with variable oxidation state (Cr, Mo, and V) are found mainly in the form of anionic complexes with the humic substances. Carbohydrates are also involved in the metals binding in the highly bioproductive water bodies, thus increasing the mass fraction of the neutral complexes during the summer and autumn periods. The molecular weight distribution of anionic metal complexes has been discussed; the substantial part of the metals constitutes the compounds with the molecular weight of below 5.0 kDa.

Roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), is an omnivorous fish species that is able to utilise a range of food resources. Both juvenile and older roach can negatively affect zooplankton abundance in freshwater bodies of water; hence populations are often reduced (biomanipulated) in order to increase zooplankton populations. The aim of this study was to assess the roach diet after large-scale removal of cyprinids (bream, roach) from a reservoir. The study was done to clarify the roach diet after three years of intensive reduction of cyprinid fish and also to find out how the roach feeding behaviour impacts the quantity of filtering zooplankton. As such, this study may help to explain more general relations within the aquatic food web and specify the roach diet during the vegetative season (from spring to autumn). Materials and methods. This study was undertaken at the Hamry water supply reservoir in the Czech Republic. Samples of macrozoobenthos, periphyton, and zooplankton were collected as representative food resources. Fish were caught using a 100-m littoral beach seine during the April to October growing season in 2011. Supplementary fish were caught using a pelagic Nordic gillnet in August and September 2012 and a 15-m beach seine in June and August 2012. Gut contents were preserved in 4% formaldehyde for later laboratory analysis (frequency of occurrence, index of preponderance, index of gut fullness). Results. 'Detritus' was the major component found in roach guts, with no difference observed in age category or locality (littoral vs. open water areas). Significant differences were observed, however, between younger (0+ and 1+, 36-92 mm) and older (>3 years, >92 mm) fish. The 0+ and 1+ age groups also fed on zooplankton (P < 0.008), accompanied by Chironomidae (1+), while diet of older roach (3-4+; 6-8+) included macrophytes and periphyton, together with Cladocera (fish from open water; P < 0.008). Conclusion. The results demonstrate that detritus was the main 'dietary' component of roach during the growing season, with macrophytes and periphyton as complementary dietary items. Zooplankton was an important dietary component of mainly younger roach age classes. Roach appear to be an important component in ichthyo-eutrophication of the Hamry Reservoir, mainly through transfer of phosphorous from plants to water.

The influence of thermal and hypoxia induced habitat compression on walleye (Sander vitreus) movements in a temperate lake	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background Globally, temperate lakes are experiencing increases in surface water temperatures, extended periods of summer stratification, and decreases of both surface and deep water dissolved oxygen (DO). The distribution of fish is influenced by a variety of factors, but water temperature and dissolved oxygen are known to be particularly constraining such that with climate change, fish will likely feel the "squeeze" from above and below. Methods This study used acoustic telemetry to explore the effects of both thermal stratification and the deoxygenation of the hypolimnion on walleye (Sander vitreus) movements in a coastal embayment in Lake Ontario. Using historical water quality monitoring data, we documented seasonal and annual fluctuations in availability of both 'suitable' (all temperatures, DO > 3 mg/L) and 'optimum' (temperatures 18-23 degrees C, DO > 5mg/L) abiotic habitat for walleye and determined how these changes influenced walleye movements over a three-year period. Results Hypoxia (< 3 mg/L DO) was present in Hamilton Harbour every summer that data were available (32 of the 42 years between 1976 and 2018), with a maximum of 68.4% of the harbour volume in 1990. We found that thermal stratification and a hypoxic hypolimnion greatly reduced the volume of suitable habitat during our telemetry study. The reduction of suitable habitat significantly reduced walleye movement distances, however as the summer progressed, this remaining suitable habitat warmed into their thermal optimum range which was found to increase walleye movement distances. Despite the seemingly poor conditions, tagged walleye remained in the harbour for most of the year, and were the fastest growing individuals compared to other sampled coastal subpopulations in Lake Ontario. Conclusions Although we documented a reduction in the quantity of non-hypoxic habitat available to walleye, the water temperature of the remaining habitat increased throughout the summer into the physiologically optimum range for walleye and increased in metabolic quality. Many abiotic factors influence how, where, and what habitat fish choose to use, and this study reveals the importance of considering both habitat quality (temperature and dissolved oxygen) and quantity when evaluating fish habitat use and behaviour.

To uncover the anti-algal activity of Cinnamomum camphora fallen leaves and promote their usage as algaecides, the composition of their water and methanol extracts was analyzed, and the inhibitory effects of extracts on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and chlorophyll (Chl) content and photosynthetic abilities in C. reinhardtii were investigated. Twenty-five compounds were detected in the water extracts, mainly including terpenoids, esters, alcohols, and ketones. Compared to water extracts, there were more compounds and higher concentration in methanol extracts. Both water and methanol extracts inhibited the growth of the two algae, and 15 mg.ml(-1) methanol extracts killed the algal cells after 48 h. The levels of Chl a and Chl b, as well as maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) in C. reinhardtii cells reduced gradually with increasing the concentration of extracts, while the maximum quantum yield of non-photochemical de-excitation (D-phi(O)) increased gradually. At the same concentration, methanol extracts showed stronger inhibitory effects than water extracts, due to their higher number of compounds and higher concentration. Therefore, C. camphora fallen leaves have a potential value as an algaecide.

In this study, twenty-nine water samples were collected from lakes and hot and cold springs in southern MER to investigate source(s) and health-risk of the F- and As contamination. According to major ion and trace element analyses, only cold spring water is safe for consumption, whereas hot spring water is the most contaminated. Leaching tests performed with the MER rhyolitic volcanic rocks and their weathered products (fluvio-lacustrine sediments) demonstrate that the main cause of the F- and As release is geogenic, i.e., not related to anthropogenic activities. The weathering of volcanic glass and minerals (apatites, clays, hydro-oxides) by CO2-bearing alkaline water induces the mobilisation of F- and As from solid to liquid phase. This process is particularly fast, when fluvio-lacustrine sediments are involved, and can be further enhanced by hot groundwater leaching. This study, investigating the distribution, sources, and mechanisms of F- and As release in MER water, could be of interest also for other sectors of the East African Rift and other similar volcano-tectonic settings.					; Godebo, Tewodros/AAA-4603-2020; Brombin, Valentina/AAD-7762-2021; MARCHINA, CHIARA/J-9275-2019; Natali, Claudio/K-6995-2019	MARCHINA, CHIARA/0000-0002-8496-635X; Brombin, Valentina/0000-0002-1845-0718; Natali, Claudio/0000-0001-7133-2369; Bianchini, Gianluca/0000-0002-5030-8068; Salani, Gian Marco/0000-0001-5132-5671														2075-163X				MAY	2020	10	5							453	10.3390/min10050453	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min10050453													WOS:000548343700068

Pacific-North American Teleconnection Controls on Precipitation Isotopes (δ18O) across the Contiguous United States and Adjacent Regions: A GCM-Based Analysis	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern has a strong influence on North America's winter climate, but much less is known about how the PNA pattern controls precipitation isotopes (e.g., O-18) across the United States. In this study, an isotopically equipped atmospheric general circulation model (isoGSM) is used to investigate how divergent phases of the PNA affect precipitation O-18 values across the United States. A simulation using observational climate and isotope data over the United States is evaluated first. The simulation explains 84% of the spatial variability of winter precipitation O-18, with an overestimation in the northern Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes. Temporally, the simulation explains 29%-81% of the interannual variability of winter precipitation O-18, with typically a higher explained variance in the east than the west. The modeled winter precipitation O-18 exhibits a clear northwest-southeast (NW-SE) dipolelike pattern in response to shifts in the PNA pattern, with the center of positive polarity in the northwestern United States and the Canadian prairies and the center of negative polarity over the Ohio River valley. This dipolelike spatial pattern is a result of the difference in atmospheric circulation and moisture sources associated with the PNA pattern. These results highlight the importance of the PNA-associated circulation dynamics in governing precipitation isotope patterns across the United States. This understanding improves our ability to interpret paleoclimate records of water isotope/hydrologic change across the United States with a much greater appreciation of regional traits. The robust antiphase oscillation in precipitation isotopes in response to shifting the PNA pattern provides a promising opportunity to reconstruct the past variability in the PNA pattern that may be recorded in ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems.

Nineteen native fish species belonging to six families populate the lake. Three of these species are endemic to the lake and four other species are endemic to the Jordan Valley system. Eight alien species are found in the lake. Four of them are breeding in nature, three cannot breed but are regularly stocked, and one is a hitchhiker that cannot breed. Growth rate equations and weight-length relationships are presented for the dominant cyprinids (Mirogrex terraesanctae, Hypophthalmichthysmolitrix, Cyprinus carpio, Barbuslongiceps, Capoetadamascina, Carasobarbuscanis), cichlids (Oreochromisaureus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapiazillii, Tristramellasimonis), grey mullets (Lizaramada, Mugilcephalus), and catfish (Clariasgariepinus). The long-term changes in fish community composition in the lakewere associated with introduction and invasion of fishes; changes in fishing intensity; modifications of the littoral, and changes of the lake ecological regime. Temporal dynamics, spatial distribution, total abundance and biomass of fish in the lake were studied based on long-term hydroacoustic monitoring. The size structure and abundance of fish in the pelagic zone of the lakedisplay explicitseasonal changes associated with fish spawning migrations and winter-spring recruitment of the dominant bleak M. terraesanctae. Water level fluctuations beyond natural have modified the littoral habitats, which are of specific importance during different life stages of fish. Water level has an immense impact on fishreproduction, survival, recruitment, population dynamics, and eventually determines the catches of commercially important species.

In Baptiste Lake, the hypolimnion remained anoxic and cisco were restricted to epilimnetic waters. Oxygenation increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in Amisk Lake, expanding habitat by up to 9 m. During oxygenation, hypolimnetic DO remained above concentrations avoided by cisco (<1.3 mg.L-1) in the treated basin, but fell below this level by midsummer in the reference basin. Consequently, cisco were distributed up to 8 m deeper in the treated than in the reference basin. In August 1990, a metalimnetic oxygen minimum in the reference basin confined >70% of the cisco to the epilimnion, while >60% of the fish inhabited the metalimnion and hypolimnion in the treated basin. Although DO remained above avoidance concentrations throughout most of the treated basin; the highest densities of cisco occurred in water with mean (+/- SD) DO concentration and temperature of 3.1 +/- 1.3 mg.L-1 and 11.8 +/- 2.1 degrees C, respectively. Thus, the extent of habitat expansion for fish during oxygenation programs will also depend on the availability of suitable temperatures.

Using legacy N as a resource can reduce extant legacy N. The uplands of Japan's Lake Inba watershed are dominated by agroecosystems, and spring waters in the lowlands contain high NO3-N concentrations. We focused on an unfertilized, commercial lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) farm where paddy fields are irrigated with spring waters. We hypothesized that the lotus field could reduce the export of legacy N and provide habitat for fish (co-benefit). Dating of spring waters using sulfur hexafluoride revealed that the residence time of water at the study site was 12.5 years and suggested that the spring waters contained legacy N. We found large reductions of NO3-N and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in water that passed through the lotus fields. A meta-analysis revealed that the reductions of NO3-N concentrations were highest in unfertilized lotus fields, and reductions of TN concentrations were higher in unfertilized paddy and lotus fields than in fertilized fields. The N removal by harvesting lotus roots 38.7 kg N/ha/year was smaller than the literature-based rate of N removal by denitrification. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding to identify the fish fauna in the lotus fields and an adjacent stream. The native fish richness was a little lower in the lotus fields than in the stream, but the presence of two endangered fish species in the lotus field suggested a moderate biodiversity conservation function. Our case study could be a good example of a nature-based solution to harness ecosystem functions to reduce legacy N.

Holocene palynology and palaeoenvironments in the Savanna Biome at Tswaing Crater, central South Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A radiocarbon dated pollen and microscopic charred particle record from the Holocene section of the Tswaing Crater in the Savanna Biome of South Africa give new evidence for environmental changes during the period c. 9400-1800 cal years BP. Pollen grains are scarce or absent in layers dating from before 9400 cal years BP but deposits rich in pollen occur in overlying layers. The section dated between 9400 cal years BP and c. 7200 cal years BP contains grass, Asteraceae and dry savanna pollen types that suggest fluctuating but generally dry moisture conditions. Later between c. 7200 and 1800 cal years BP, broad leaved savanna woodland elements and local swamp pollen indicate relatively stable vegetation and wetter mildly fluctuating climatic conditions, which is consistent with previously published biomarker analysis. Between c. 6200 and 5500 cal years BP, the numbers of charred particles increased slightly. This indicates burning activity, which can probably be attributed to dry season ignition of denser fuel under relatively moist conditions. A decrease of local swamp pollen between c. 3600 and 3500 cal years BP suggests that conditions became briefly drier again as pollen of woody elements declined in favour of open grassland pollen. A comparison between the Tswaing pollen profile and various other sequences within the central interior of South Africa suggests generally similar conditions over the central interior of the sub-continent during the Holocene deviating from sequences further afield along the coastal areas of southern Africa. Between 9400 cal years BP and ca. 7200 cal years BP, the western and southern coasts were probably controlled by different atmospheric and oceanic circulation regimes under the influence of a strong westerly winter-rain system while the north-eastern area where, Tswaing is situated, experienced weaker precession and less summer rain from the Intertropical Convergence Zone.

C	Delisle, CE; André, P		Epp, HT		Delisle, CE; André, P			The Montreal, Quebec experience in used snow disposal and treatment	ECOLOGICAL RECLAMATION IN CANADA AT CENTURY'S TURN	CANADIAN PLAINS PROCEEDINGS				35TH Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Society-of-Environmental-Biologists on Ecological Reclamation in Canada at Centurys Turn	SEP 26-29, 1995	REGINA, CANADA	Canadian Soc Environm Biologists				In 1990, the Association des Biologistes du Quebec organized a symposium with the Saint Lawrence Centre (Environment Canada) entitled: "The Saint-Lawrence: a river to be reclaimed" (ABQ 1990). A paper on used snow then was presented explaining how snow management practices can be modified to prevent contaminant input into the Montreal harbour waters. Taking used snow as an example, the present paper exposes how far we should go in the reclaiming procedure. In urban and industrial areas a zero discharge objective remains excessive for used snow and is economically hard to achieve. An average of 250 cm of snow falls on the city of Montreal every winter. There are from eight to ten major snowstorms each season, requiring snow removal along 1900 km of streets and 3200 km of sidewalks. This operation annually produces a volume of about 7,000,000 m(3) of used snow which is disposed through five methods: quarry dumping, snow chutes into sewers, surface sites, snow melting, and river dumping. The latter method will not be allowed beyond 1996 due to regulation from the Quebec Ministry of Environment. Of the 30,000,000 m(3) used snow in the Province of Quebec more than 30% is discharged directly into lakes and rivers (Andre and Delisle 1989). Once it has fallen to the ground, snow stays on the streets for a short period (24 to 96 hours) before it is plowed and cleared away. During this time, the snow accumulates de-icers (e.g. NaCl) and urban pollutants of all kinds (e.g. Pb, Cr) and this whole mixture is designated as "used snow." Since 1984, the city of Montreal and suburbs have carried out environmental studies to learn more about the quality of used snow in an urban area and its potential threat to the environment. Research on used snow contamination has been done along two kinds of streets. Commercial and residential arteries were selected and results showed that significant differences existed between these sites. Equally different results were found between residential and commercial sectors when the used snow was taken from transport trucks. The duration that used snow stays piled up along the curbside also influenced its concentration of contaminants. The average concentrations of contaminants in used snow after truck loading were high in suspended solids, chlorides, sulphate, oil and grease, calcium and sodium, and also were high in some heavy metals (Fe, Pb). This is explained by the fact that curbside used snow is plowed along the street and accumulates contaminants through contact with the road pollutants during loading operations. The Quebec Ministry of Environment and Fauna policy regarding used snow will be discussed (MENVIQ 1988) and compared with urban runoff problem and sewer overflow, which are of equivalent importance.																			0317-6401		0-88977-102-2				1997	28						10	18																WOS:000079153400002

Observed, simulated and projected extreme climate indices over Pakistan in changing climate	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This article explores the observed, simulated and projected extreme climate indices from daily observed dataset for several meteorological stations as well as NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset. The NEX-GDDP dataset is an extension of the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs, performed under the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Two greenhouse gas emission scenarios have been considered, known as Representative Concentration Pathways, i.e., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The core climate indices, proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), were used for investigation of climatic extremes over different provinces of Pakistan. The results show that summer days have significantly increased in the Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir (GB-AJK) region by 24 and 18days, respectively, triggering the frequency of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) events in the region. Moreover, the projected climate shows an increase of 6days in the frequency of summer days in the GB-AJK region in the next 30years. The frequency of heavy precipitation is significantly increasing in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, which may augment the flood hazard in the region. Future projection shows an increase of 1.3 degrees C in the mean maximum temperature in the KP province by the year 2045. An average increase of 1.9 degrees C in the mean minimum temperature has been observed in the Punjab province over the past 54years(1960-2013), whereas there is a projected increase of 1.4 degrees C in the mean minimum temperature in the next 30years. Such an increasing trend in the mean minimum temperature may cause implications for food and agriculture sectors in the Punjab province. The results show a significantly increasing trend in the mean maximum temperature and summer days in the Sindh province, which may enhance the frequency and intensity of heat waves in the region. There is a projected increase of 20days in summer days in the Sindh province. Similar rising trend in the temperature has been observed in the Balochistan province, which may ultimately enhance the dust and sand storms in this region.

J	Wang, N; Chen, J; Zhang, YY; Xu, YM; Yu, WZ				Wang, Ning; Chen, Jian; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Xu, Yongming; Yu, Wenzheng			The Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Driving Factors of Dust Emissions in East Asia (2000-2021)	REMOTE SENSING												The climate effect and environmental pollution caused by dust discharged into the atmosphere have attracted much attention. However, the driving factors of dust emissions have not been studied thoroughly. Here, spatiotemporal variations in dust emissions and the relationship between dust emissions and large-scale atmospheric circulation in East Asia from 2000 to 2021 were investigated using Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Pathfinder Satellite Observations, ERA5 reanalysis data, and climate indices. Results showed that the Taklimakan Desert in the Tarim Basin, the Gurbantonggut Desert in the Junggar Basin, the Turpan Basin, and the Gobi Desert in western Inner Mongolia and southern Mongolia are the main sources of dust emissions in East Asia. The period of strong dust emissions is from March to May, and emissions to the atmosphere were mainly distributed at 0-4 km in the troposphere. In the eastern and southwestern Tarim Basin, northern Junggar Basin, and parts of the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia, dust emissions have significantly increased over the past 22 years, whereas in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau, southwestern Inner Mongolia, and a small part of the northern Mongolian Gobi Desert there was a significant decreasing trend. The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) were significantly negatively correlated with East Asian dust emissions the following spring. The various phases of the AO/NAO coupling have clear different effects on East Asian dust emissions in the spring. When the AO/NAO coupling was negative (positive), the East Asian trough and Siberian High were strengthened (weakened), the frequency of cold air activity increased (weakened), 800 hPa wind speed strengthened (weakened), and East Asian emissions increased (decreased). In AO-/NAO+ years, the Asian polar vortex was stronger to the south and the East Asian trough was stronger to the west. The Lake Baikal trough was in the deepening phase, which caused more polar cold air to move into East Asia, aggravating the intensity of dust activity. In the AO+/NAO- years, the Siberian High and East Asian trough weakened, which was unfavorable to the southward movement of cold air from Siberia. Therefore, the frequency of windy weather in East Asia decreased, partly weakening dust emissions. However, a positive geopotential anomaly in northeast China and a negative geopotential anomaly in South Asia triggered an anomalous enhancement in easterly wind in the tropospheric area over northwest China. Strengthening of the Balkhash trough provides favorable conditions for gale weather in northwest China. The frequency of gale weather increased, and dust emissions were enhanced in northwest China.

J	Kuuppo, P; Tamminen, T; Voss, M; Schulte, U				Kuuppo, Pirjo; Tamminen, Timo; Voss, Maren; Schulte, Ulrike			Nitrogenous discharges to the eastern Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea: Elemental flows, stable isotope signatures, and their estuarine modification	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												We studied the nutrient input to the Gulf of Finland via River Neva, the largest river discharging freshwater to the Baltic Sea, and characterised the isotopic signatures (N-15, O-18, C-13) in dissolved and particulate substances (NO3-, PON, POC, DIC) in the River Neva over two seasonal cycles, as well as in samples from St. Petersburg wastewater treatment plants (NO3-, NH4+, PON, POC). These riverine and municipal discharges account for 40% of terrestrial inorganic N loading to the Gulf of Finland, representing annually 7% of the total nitrogen pool in the water mass of the whole Gulf. To describe and evaluate the modification of these isotopic signals along a Gulf of Finland transect towards the Baltic Proper, two cruises were arranged, one in late spring after the annual maximum in River Neva runoff, and one in autumn, in the late phase of the annual growth season. River Neva nitrate signatures of N-15 and O-18 indicated major agricultural fertilizer origin of nitrogen, and the isotopic composition was clearly lighter (delta N-15-NO3- mean of 2.4 parts per thousand air) than previously measured from more southern rivers discharging into the Baltic Sea. Because of the light composition of the River Neva N source, close to the N-15 signatures of the open Gulf, as well as of the efficient depletion of the inorganic load already in the innermost estuary, straightforward end-member tracer analysis of the transport of N in the basin is problematic. St. Petersburg wastewater ammonium showed, however, high delta N-15 values (ca. 13 parts per thousand), which gives a first estimate of 5.8 parts per thousand for 6 N-15 of the easternmost estuarine total inorganic N source. The available sediment data from the basin (delta N-15 6 to 8 parts per thousand) somewhat exceeds the average source signature. This emphasizes the significance of biological transformation processes, most importantly assimilation of inorganic nitrogen, food web interactions and denitrification, which all involve isotopic fractionation, for the mass balance models describing the dynamics of the sources and sinks of the N cycle of the basin.

Everest region: A review of climate and environmental changes	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Mt. Everest (Qomolangma or Sagarmatha), the highest mount on Earth and located in the central Himalayas between China and Nepal, is characterized by highly concentrated glaciers and diverse landscapes, and is considered to be one of the most sensitive area to climate change. In this paper, we comprehensively synthesized the climate and environmental changes in the Mt. Everest region, including changes in air temperature, precipitation, glaciers and glacial lakes, atmospheric environment, river and lake water quality, and vegetation phenology. Historical temperature reconstruction from ice cores and tree rings revealed the distinct features of 20th century warming in the Mt. Everest region. Meteorological observations further proved that the Mt. Everest region has been experiencing significant warming (approximately 0.33 degrees C/decade) but relatively stable precipitation during 1961-2018 AD. Projected results (during 2006-2099 AD) under different representative concentration pathway scenarios showed a general warming trend in the region, with larger warming occurring in winter than in summer. Meanwhile, the precipitation projections varied spatially with no significant trends over the region. Intensive glacier shrinkage was characterized by decreasing glacier areas, while glacier-fed river runoff increased. Glacial lakes expanded with increasing glacial lake areas and numbers. These findings indicated a clear regional hydrological response to climate warming. Owing to the remote location of Mt. Everest, the present atmospheric environment remained relatively clean; however, long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants from South Asia and West Asia may have substantially influenced the Mt. Everest region, resulting in increasing concentrations of pollutants since the Industrial Revolution. Anthropogenic activities have been shown to influence river and lake water quality in this remote region, especially in the downstream. The end of the vegetation growing season advanced in the northern slope and did not change in southern slope region of the Mt. Everest, and there was no significant change in start date of the growing season in the region. This review will enhance our understanding of climate and environmental changes in the Mt. Everest region under global warming.					liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024; Tripathee, Lekhendra/T-4350-2019; Mayewski, Paul/HRD-6969-2023; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Guo, Wanqin/E-7553-2015; Shen, Miaogen/A-8374-2011; 丛, 志远/E-5237-2012; Gao, Tanguang/ABG-7175-2021; Xu, Guobao/J-4006-2019; JI, ZHENMING/H-3904-2016	Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Luo, Xi/0000-0002-9836-9310; Shen, Miaogen/0000-0001-5742-8807; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2022	225								103911	10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103911		JAN 2022											WOS:000786673900001

Short-term variability in coastal community and ecosystem dynamics in northern Lake Michigan	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Despite their ecological and economic importance, coastal biological communities and ecosystem processes in large lakes have been understudied compared to those offshore. We investigated temporal variability in the abundance and assemblage composition of coastal organisms in northern Lake Michigan. We sampled nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, benthic invertebrates, and fish along the east coast of Beaver Island, Michigan, USA, with high temporal frequency (every d to every 2 wk) over 2 summers. We also examined connectivity between coastal and offshore habitats with both hourly water current data from the Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System and sampling offshore 2 to 3x per summer. The abundance of littoral zone organisms varied markedly on daily to weekly timescales for both benthic invertebrates and water-column organisms (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish). For example, zooplankton abundance changed by a mean of 297% between sampling dates at the same location. Within-season peaks in plankton abundance also differed among years. Specifically, peak chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were observed 1 mo earlier in 2016 than 2015, and early summer (Jun) zooplankton abundance was 333% higher in 2016 than 2015. Furthermore, our data suggest that water currents may influence the abundance and assemblage composition of plankton, possibly by altering the flux of nutrients and organisms from offshore to coastal habitats. Specifically, zooplankton abundance increased by a mean of 194% when surface currents moved eastward before we sampled, and eastward surface velocity significantly altered zooplankton assemblage composition. Chl a concentration increased by a mean of 106% when surface currents moved northward prior to sampling. In contrast, the abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates and fish differed among sites and was not significantly related to water currents. The abundance of these organisms also declined throughout the summer. Therefore, benthic and water-column organisms are controlled by different processes, so patterns in their local abundance are out of sync. Understanding variability in coastal communities may enhance monitoring and design of effective protocols for investigating large lake ecology. Further, understanding the importance of regional movement of nutrients and organisms may be key to understanding community and ecosystem structure in coastal areas.

J	D'Andrea, WJ; Huang, Y				D'Andrea, WJ; Huang, Y			Long chain alkenones in Greenland lake sediments: Low δ13C values and exceptional abundance	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Long chain alkenones (LCAs) are a key class of biomarkers for certain members of the algal class Prymnesiophyceae (i.e., prymnesiophytes). They are ubiquitous in ocean sediments where they are extensively used for paleotemperature reconstruction, but are rare in lake sediments. Here, we report the discovery of LCAs (C-37-C-39) throughout a sediment core from one lake and in surface sediments of five lakes located in west Greenland. LCA concentrations in the surface sediments are one to two orders of magnitude greater than those reported for other lacustrine surface sediments around the world. The presence Of C-38 methyl ketones distinguishes Greenland LCA distributions from those found in other saline lakes in cold regimes. LCAs are present in five lakes with elevated salinity, but absent from five freshwater lakes in the study region. Using the published temperature calibration for lake sediments, alkenone unsaturation indices (U-37(K) and U-37(K')) in the surface sediments of the Greenland lakes appear to record late spring/early summer temperature when algal blooms occur, supporting the use of lacustrine alkenones as a paleotemperature proxy. The LCAs have exceptionally low delta(13)C values, ranging from -40 parts per thousand to -42 parts per thousand and are depleted by 3-10 parts per thousand. relative to short chain fatty acids and sterols in the same samples. These delta(13)C values are the lowest reported for alkenones in a natural setting and have important implications for tracing the alkenone producers in lakes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We calculated the dynamic contribution associated with the change in frequency of the WTs and the thermodynamic contribution due to changes in the spatial patterns of the environmental fields of the WTs. Six WTs were obtained using a k-means clustering analysis of 850 hPa winds in reanalysis data from November to February of 1948-2022. All the WTs can only persist for a few days. The most frequent winter weather type is WT1 (shallow trough in Eastern U.S.), which can persist or likely transfer to WT4 (Mississippi River Valley ridge). WT1 becomes less frequent in El Nino years, while the frequency of WT4 does not change much. WTs 2-6 correspond to a loop of eastward propagating waves with troughs and ridges in the mid-latitude westerlies. Three WTs with a deep trough in the Southeast U.S., which are WT2 (east coast trough), WT3 (off east coast trough) and WT6 (plains trough), become more frequent in El Nino years. The more frequent deep troughs (WTs 2, 3 and 6) and less frequent shallow trough (WT1) result in above-normal precipitation in the coastal Southeast U.S. in the winter of El Nino years. WT5 (off coast Carolina High), with maximum precipitation extending from Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes, becomes less frequent in El Nino years, which corresponds to the below-normal precipitation from the Great Lakes to Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Valley in El Nino years, and vice versa in La Nina years. The relative contribution of the thermodynamic and dynamic contribution is location dependent. On the east coast, the two contributions are similar in magnitude.					; Noble, Stephen/O-2000-2015	Viner, Brian/0000-0003-2690-7682; Noble, Stephen/0000-0001-5192-8974														2073-4433				AUG	2022	13	8							1159	10.3390/atmos13081159	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13081159													WOS:000846315900001
J	Matthews, DA; Effler, SW; Matthews, CM				Matthews, DA; Effler, SW; Matthews, CM			Ammonia and toxicity criteria in polluted Onondaga Lake, New York	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Temporal patterns of total ammonia (T-NH3) in the upper layers of an ammonia-polluted, saline, hypereutrophic urban lake, Onondaga Lake, New York, and its status with respect to ammonia toxicity criteria are documented and evaluated for the spring to fall interval over 10 years (1989 to 1998). Implications of revisions (n = 5) in the criteria (1985 to 1999) and the omission of ionic strength effects in the most recent revisions for this saline system are considered. The implications of diurnal variations in pH for application of both chronic and acute criteria are illustrated based on 14 days of hourly pH data. Concentrations of T-NH3 in the upper layers of this lake were extremely high because of discharges received from a 3.5 m(3)/s (80 mgd) wastewater treatment plant; the average concentration during the April to June interval for the 10 years was 2.3 mg/L. Substantial interannual and seasonal variations were observed in the T-NH3 pool of the lake. April concentrations were largely regulated by the dilution provided by antecedent (i.e., December to March) tributary flow. Revisions of the chronic criteria have been progressively less stringent for low ionic strength conditions. However, under the saline conditions of this lake, the most recent (1998 and 1999) revisions can be more stringent than the earlier criteria. The 1984 chronic criterion (published in 1985) was exceeded by a wide margin annually (average factor of 2.2 for April to June) and for durations greater than 75 days. Widely different diurnal patterns in pH and the occurrence of an exceedance of the 1998 acute criterion during a pH maximum are documented. These diurnal variations are an important factor in the design of programs to assess status and in application of criteria for productive systems.																			1061-4303					NOV-DEC	2000	72	6					731	741		10.2175/106143000X138355	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143000X138355													WOS:000171863000012
J	Datta, DK; Ghosh, PK; Karim, MR; Rahman, MM				Datta, Dilip Kumar; Ghosh, Prosun Kumar; Karim, Md Rezaul; Rahman, Md Mujibor			Geochemical options for water security in a coastal urban agglomerate of Lower Bengal Delta, Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Khulna- situated in the Lower Bengal Delta of Bangladesh- is one of the most stressed coastal agglomerates globally under the realm of rapid changes in the climate pattern. This research assesses the geochemical options for water security of Khulna City Corporation (KCC) by analysing a total of 47 surface- and 62 groundwater samples collected during both monsoon and winter from stations uniformly distributed over the city following standard methods. The dissolved ions from three possible water sources such as the ponds and lakes, the river Mayur and groundwater generally show a similar relative dissolved ions concentration pattern where the alkali metals (Na+ + K+ ) exceed the alkaline earths (Ca2+ + Mg2+ ), and the strong acidic anions (Cl- + SO42-) and the weak acidic anions (HCO3- ) are of equal importance, indicating natural softening and mixing of water from both plagioclase and carbonate weathering, and seawater sources. Although the spatial variation with reference to mean concentrations of dissolved ions among different sampling stations during both monsoon and winter seasons in all the water sources such as the ponds and lakes, the river Mayur and the groundwater is not statistically significant at 5% level, the variation in dissolved ion concentrations among the water sources is statistically significant at 5% level. The temporal variation in concentrations between monsoon and winter seasons for all water sources is statistically significant for most dissolved ions, suggesting active material exchange in the system. The molar ratios among the dissolved ions suggest that both continental/meteoric and seawater (saline water)/oceanic contributions are important in KCC water. The ions in ponds and lakes and in river Mayur might have derived from similar sources; however, the sources are varied in the case of groundwater. The geochemical mechanism controlling the ponds and lakes, and the Mayur water chemistry is commanded by the process of rock weathering, while the winter chemistry of most groundwater is controlled by the process of evaporation and crystallization. Water from the three potential sources of KCC indicates mixed hydrochemical facies where the process of natural softening is active, while certain KCC groundwater indicates reverse softening and up-coning of saline front. An assessment of potable water quality among the three sources suggests that the ponds and lakes, and the river Mayur have the geochemical potential to provide water security to the KCC, particularly the river Mayur during monsoon. Thus, a plan for maintaining especially the Mayur as a freshwater reservoir is necessary for meeting the freshwater challenges in KCC.

Seasonal bee communities vary in their responses to resources at local and landscape scales: implication for land managers	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context There is great interest in land management practices for pollinators; however, a quantitative comparison of landscape and local effects on bee communities is necessary to determine if adding small habitat patches can increase bee abundance or species richness. The value of increasing floral abundance at a site is undoubtedly influenced by the phenology and magnitude of floral resources in the landscape, but due to the complexity of measuring landscape-scale resources, these factors have been understudied. Objectives To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the relative importance of local versus landscape scale resources for bee communities, identified the most important metrics of local and landscape quality, and evaluated how these relationships vary with season. Methods We studied season-specific relationships between local and landscape quality and wild-bee communities at 33 sites in the Finger Lakes region of New York, USA. We paired site surveys of wild bees, plants, and soil characteristics with a multi-dimensional assessment of landscape composition, configuration, insecticide toxic load, and a spatio-temporal evaluation of floral resources at local and landscape scales. Results We found that the most relevant spatial scale and landscape factor varied by season. Early-season bee communities responded primarily to landscape resources, including the presence of flowering trees and wetland habitats. In contrast, mid to late-season bee communities were more influenced by local conditions, though bee diversity was negatively impacted when sites were embedded in highly agricultural landscapes. Soil composition had complex impacts on bee communities, and likely reflects effects on plant community flowering. Conclusions Early-season bees can be supported by adding flowering trees and wetlands, while mid to late-season bees can be supported by local addition of summer and fall flowering plants. Sites embedded in landscapes with a greater proportion of natural areas will host a greater bee species diversity.

J	BRADFORD, DF				BRADFORD, DF			MASS MORTALITY AND EXTINCTION IN A HIGH-ELEVATION POPULATION OF RANA-MUSCOSA	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Rana muscosa is one of several high-elevation amphibians that have recently disappeared from seemingly pristine sites. The present study documents an event of mass mortality among larval and metamorphosed R. muscosa in a lake in Kings Canyon National Park, California, and the ultimate extinction of the population. In 1979 metamorphosed individuals declined from ca. 800 individuals in early summer to nearly zero in late summer. During this time many carcasses were collected, individuals showed symptoms of red-leg disease, and blood from an affected individual contained the bacterial pathogen characteristic of this disease, Aeromonas hydrophila. Also during the summer of 1979, nearly all of the approximately 1100 tadpoles began metamorphosis, but all metamorphosing individuals were consumed by Brewer's blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus). This population of R. muscosa continued to exist until at least 1983, but was extinct by 1989. Recolonization of the site will probably never occur because streams connecting to extant populations of R. muscosa now contain introduced fishes.																			0022-1511					JUN	1991	25	2					174	177		10.2307/1564645	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1564645													WOS:A1991FQ09900007

The Damzung Co Salt Lake in central Tibet has high boron concentrations (B = 276-313 mg/L) and is an ideal site for investigation. The aim of this study is to analyze the boron geochemistry and isotope composition of surface brine, source water, country rock, and Quaternary deposits (carbonate clay, stromatolite, and travertine) in the lake, to understand the unusual boron enrichment of the salt lakes in Tibet. Concentrations of boron in stream water samples from the basin are low (B = 0.172 2.08 mg/L), with the exception of one sample that has an input of geothermal water (B = up to 13.6 mg/L). Their variable boron isotope compositions represent the characteristics of country rock weathering input (811B = 8.6 to 0.5%0). Hot springs have much higher boron concentrations (B = 3.31-49.4 mg/L) than streams and cold springs (B = 0.434-4.82 mg/ L). Boron isotope data show that the 811B values of streams, hot springs (-9.8 to 8.5%0), and cold springs (-14.5 to 1.2%0) are much higher than those of the salt lake (-18.5 to 17.4%0), except in samples containing Quaternary deposits. This finding, therefore, rules out the possibility that the present boron deposits originate from country rock weathering or hot springs, as historically proposed by Chinese scientists. The slight variability in boron isotopic composition in the present lake indicates only one major boron source. Three samples containing Quaternary deposits have different boron isotopic compositions with 37.2 to 35.3%0 (carbonate clay), 29.5 to 24.9%0 (travertine), and 28.2 to 26.7%0 (stromatolite). The fractionation factor between carbonate clay and the lake are very similar to that between seawater, sediment and carbonate in a similar pH range, compared with stromatolite and travertine. Hence, we conclude that early carbonate clay deposits within the lake basin are the present main source of boron in the Damxung Co Salt Lake.

J	Miller, LM; Close, T; Kapuscinski, AR				Miller, LM; Close, T; Kapuscinski, AR			Lower fitness of hatchery and hybrid rainbow trout compared to naturalized populations in Lake Superior tributaries	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												We have documented an early life survival advantage by naturalized populations of anadromous rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss over a more recently introduced hatchery population and outbreeding depression resulting from interbreeding between the two strains. We tested the hypothesis that offspring of naturalized and hatchery trout, and reciprocal hybrid crosses, survive equally from fry to age 1+ in isolated reaches of Lake Superior tributary streams in Minnesota. Over the first summer, offspring of naturalized females had significantly greater survival than offspring of hatchery females in three of four comparisons (two streams and 2 years of stocking). Having an entire naturalized genome, not just a naturalized mother, was important for survival over the first winter. Naturalized offspring outperformed all others in survival to age 1+ and hybrids had reduced, but intermediate, survival relative to the two pure crosses. Averaging over years and streams, survival relative to naturalized offspring was 0.59 for hybrids with naturalized females, 0.37 for the reciprocal hybrids, and 0.21 for hatchery offspring. Our results indicate that naturalized rainbow trout are better adapted to the conditions of Minnesota's tributaries to Lake Superior so that they outperform the hatchery-propagated strain in the same manner that many native populations of salmonids outperform hatchery or transplanted fish. Continued stocking of the hatchery fish may conflict with a management goal of sustaining the naturalized populations.

J	Dorn, T; Day, M				Dorn, Taylor; Day, Mackenzie			Exploring the transition between water- and wind-dominated landscapes in Deep Springs, California, as an analog for transitioning landscapes on Mars	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												Many planetary surfaces have been shaped by eolian and fluvial processes, and understanding the resulting landscape is of critical importance to understanding changes in climate. Surface features on Earth and Mars are commonly observed using a variety of remote sensing methods. The observed geomorphology provides evidence of present processes and paleo-processes, but interpretations are limited by the resolution of the data and similarity to well-understood systems on Earth. In this work, we study a complex fluvio-lacustrine and eolian landscape at Deep Springs playa, California, using field measurements and remote sensing as an analog for a wet-to-dry-transitioning landscape on Mars. The playa system in arid Deep Springs reflects fluvio-lacustrine processes in its interior but transitions to eolian-dominated processes along the playa margin. Weather station data and field observations collected over 34 months illustrate the interplay between eolian and lacustrine processes and provide context for interpreting the observed geomorphology in aerial images. Our results showed a consistent distal-to-proximal geomorphic transition in the landscape defined by the changing expression of polygonal fractures, wave ripples, and evaporite deposits. Crescent-shaped sedimentary deposits, originally suspected to be related to barchan dunes, proved unrelated to eolian processes. We discuss the processes, sedimentary features, and climate drivers at Deep Springs to provide a potential framework for identifying and interpreting similar interactions between fluvio-lacustrine and eolian geomorphology elsewhere on Earth, on Mars, and beyond.																			2196-6311	2196-632X				MAR 6	2023	11	2					149	165		10.5194/esurf-11-149-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-149-2023													WOS:000943409700001

Ixodes kingi was commonly encountered on both northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) and thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), whereas L sculptus frequently infested S. tridecemlineatus but was absent from O. leucogaster. Low numbers of ticks of both species were collected from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii). Nymphal loads of L kingi and L sculptus increased dramatically on commonly infested rodent species from spring (May-June) to summer (July-August). Further, rodents trapped on prairie-dog towns tended to experience increased nymphal loads of L kingi (O. leucogaster, S. tridecemlineatus) but decreased loads of L sculptus (S. tridecemlineatus) following plague epizootics among prairie dog populations. A summary of published North American host records revealed that L kingi has been recorded from humans, domestic animals (cat, dog), 17 species of carnivores, 40 species of rodents, and four species of lagomorphs, and that L sculptus has been recorded from humans, domestic animals (cat, dog, goat), 13 species of carnivores, 34 species of rodents, and three species of lagomorphs. In accordance with our observations from Colorado, I. kingi commonly has been found to infest heteromyid and murid rodents (such as grasshopper mice), whereas L sculptus most frequently has been collected from ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, especially Spermophilus ground squirrels. The potential roles of L kingi and L sculptus as enzootic vectors of human pathogens, particularly the agents of tularemia (Francisella tularensis), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus), are discussed.

Spatial analysis of ice phenology trends across the Laurentian Great Lakes region during a recent warming period	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined spatial patterns of trends in ice phenology and duration for 65 waterbodies across the Great Lakes region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, and New York) during a recent period of rapid climate warming (1975-2004). Average rates of change in freeze (3.3 d decade(-1)) and breakup (-2.1 d decade(-1)) dates were 5.8 and 3.3 times more rapid, respectively, than historical rates (1846-1995) for Northern Hemisphere waterbodies. Average ice duration decreased by 5.3 d decade(-1). Over the same time period, average fall through spring temperatures in this region increased by 0.7 degrees C decade(-1), while the average number of days with snow decreased by 5.0 d decade(-1), and the average snow depth on those days decreased by 1.7 cm decade(-1). Breakup date and ice duration trends varied over the study area, with faster changes occurring in the southwest. Trends for each site were compared to static waterbody characteristics and meteorological variables and their trends. The trend toward later freeze date was stronger in large, low-elevation waterbodies; however, freeze date trends had no geographic patterns or relationships to meteorological variables. Variability in the strength of trends toward earlier breakup was partially explained by spatial differences in the rate of change in the number of days with snow cover, mean snow depth, air temperature (warmer locations showed stronger trends), and rate of change in air temperature. Differences in ice duration trends were explained best by a combination of elevation and the local rate of change in either temperature or the number of days with snow cover.					; Jensen, Olaf/E-4947-2011; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011	Soranno, Patricia/0000-0003-1668-9271; Futter, Martyn/0000-0002-9789-7138													0024-3590					SEP	2007	52	5					2013	2026		10.4319/lo.2007.52.5.2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.5.2013													WOS:000249416200023

Specifically, the water level of the main surface drinking water reservoir supplying the City of Rome (Lake Bracciano) is currently low and the lacustrine ecosystem is in an unstable state. The aim of this study is to describe the current state of Lake Bracciano via a multidisciplinary approach in the light of the climate and hydrological variation over the past decade. The digital reconstruction of the lake cuvette made it possible to quantify the effects of oscillations in the level of the lake on the shoreline, while the potential impact of meteorological forcing on the lake-level oscillations was investigated by monitoring anomalies in precipitation and evaporation rates. The preliminary results indicate that the present Lake Bracciano crisis mainly results from below-average precipitation since 2015, compounded by significant water extraction. Indeed, in the past 3years, there has been almost no winter recovery phase, resulting in a total water loss of 114millions of m(3), which has never been observed before. In November 2017, the lake level reached a historic low of -198cm with respect to the hydrological zero (corresponding to a 13.5% reduction in the area of the lake bed responsible for self-purification), considerably below the sustainable level of -150cm. We conclude that the persistent low precipitation (-50% in 2017 with respect to the 1961-1990 baseline), intense evaporation (6.7mm/day during summer 2017), and extraction have brought the ecological state and associated ecosystem services of Lake Bracciano to conditions of serious stress.					; Parrone, Daniele/ABI-3850-2020; Guyennon, Nicolas/AAI-2216-2021; Romano, Emanuele/I-9378-2019; Rossi, David/L-1665-2019; Scala, Antonio/A-2098-2012	GHERGO, STEFANO/0000-0002-1443-1886; Guyennon, Nicolas/0000-0002-0306-0610; Scala, Antonio/0000-0002-3414-2686; Parrone, Daniele/0000-0002-0153-1474; Rossi, David/0000-0002-9089-3257													2037-4631	1720-0776				MAR	2019	30	1					83	91		10.1007/s12210-018-0733-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-018-0733-4													WOS:000461301600010

Their signatures in climate proxy archives can differ substantially because of their lower magnitude and regional diversity. However, if identified they can yield better understanding of the physical mechanisms regionally linking causes and effects. Here we describe a high-resolution record of organic matter accumulation in the sediments of Burg lake (Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula), as assessed using loss on ignition (LOI), and compare it with the ice rafted debris (IRD) indexes from the North Atlantic. The LOI record indicates two main phases in the water body, a lacustrine phase as a shallow lake and a palustrine phase as a fen. The latter covers the period 2600-7200 cal.yr BP and within it there is a high coherence between LOI and IRD, which indicates submillennial climate fluctuations in the Pyrenees that can be related to the North Atlantic influence. The Burg's LOI record suggests wetter (and occasionally colder) situations in the Pyrenees during high IRD in the Atlantic (Bond oscillations). These fluctuations would likely affect the snow covered period in the mountains (winter and spring seasons) the most, the period in which Atlantic westerlies currently have higher influence on precipitation over the Pyrenees. These climatic oscillations could have favoured Abies penetration during the mid Holocene, as evidenced by increased pollen percentages of this taxon during low IRD values (drier conditions). The pollen record also suggests potential relationships between climate and human activity as early as at mid Holocene, as human-related cereals increase during all the low IRD periods. The human signature (charcoal, cereals) becomes particularly evident at around 2800 cal.yr BP; in this oscillation Pinus overtake Abies in the conifer response to low IRD.

Stable isotope analysis reveals variable diets of stoats (Mustela erminea) in the alpine zone of New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The alpine zone of New Zealand covers c. 30% of public conservation land and is home to a high diversity of endemic species. Predation by introduced stoats (Mustela erminea) is identified as a major threat to alpine fauna. However, a lack of biological information, such as what stoats eat in different settings, hinders efforts to focus control measures in time and space in order to achieve the greatest conservation gains. We used a biochemical tool, stable isotope analysis, to estimate stoat diet across three time-periods in the alpine zone of three national parks. We then assessed possible drivers of dietary variation that could lead to greater per capita consumption of native species by stoats. Our models indicate that mammal prey items formed the largest contribution to the metabolic requirements of stoats in long-term estimates (47-90%), but the mid-term (spring and summer) estimates show a greater reliance on insects. The estimated proportions of prey consumed did not differ with elevation, sex, or age, but were significantly different between sites and seasons. Both stoat and ship rat (Rattus rattus) abundance were significant in explaining the proportion of mammals consumed. Higher stoat trap-catch and an absence of ship rats at one site (Nelson Lakes National Park) coincided with a greater range of prey being regularly consumed by stoats; this was the only site to record substantial proportions of birds (26%) and skinks (33%) in stoat diet. Conservation managers should be aware of the potential for marked differences in per capita rates of consumption of threatened alpine species by stoats, possibly linked to differences in abundance of mammalian prey. While this study confirms that stable isotope analysis can be useful to assess the diet of stoats, further research is needed to determine specific isotope enrichment values and to confirm the accuracy of these results.

Precipitation assessment based on isotopic data has a potential implication for moisture sources. In the study, D and O-18 of precipitation samples collected from six rainfall events were analyzed for stable isotope composition to provide implication of isotopic characteristics as well as moisture sources in Hemuqiao basin within Lake Tai drainage basin, eastern China. In these events, stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation had strong variations. Models of the meteoric water line and deuterium excess for different rainfall types (typhoon and plum rain, which is caused by precipitation along a persistent stationary front known as the Meiyu front for nearly two months during the late spring and early summer between eastern Russia, China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan) were established. Compared with plum rain, the moisture source of typhoon events had higher relative humidity and temperature. Moisture transport pathways were traced using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT Model, developed by NOAA, Washington DC, U.S.) to verify the linkage with isotopic composition and moisture source. The moisture sources of typhoon events mostly derived from tropical ocean air with higher isotopic value, while that of plum rain events came from near-source local air with lower isotopic value.

The dataset includes 275 time series of glacier fluctuations based on historical, tree ring, lake sediment, radiocarbon and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide data. The most detailed and reliable series for individual glaciers and regional compilations are compared with summer temperature and, when available, winter precipitation reconstructions, the most important parameters for glacier mass balance. In many cases major glacier advances correlate with multi-decadal periods of decreased summer temperature. In a few cases, such as in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, some glacier advances occurred during relatively warm wet times. The timing and scale of glacier fluctuations over the past two millennia varies greatly from region to region. However, the number of glacier advances shows a clear pattern for the high, mid and low latitudes and, hence, points to common forcing factors acting at the global scale. Globally, during the first millennium CE glaciers were smaller than between the advances in 13th to early 20th centuries CE. The precise extent of glacier retreat in the first millennium is not well defined; however, the most conservative estimates indicate that during the 1st and 2nd centuries in some regions glaciers were smaller than at the end of 20th/early 21st centuries. Other periods of glacier retreat are identified regionally during the 5th and 8th centuries in the European Alps, in the 3rd-6th and 9th centuries in Norway, during the 10th-13th centuries in southern Alaska, and in the 18th century in Spitsbergen. However, no single period of common global glacier retreat of centennial duration, except for the past century, has yet been identified. In contrast, the view that the Little Ice Age was a period of global glacier expansion beginning in the 13th century (or earlier) and reaching a maximum in 17th-19th centuries is supported by our data. The pattern of glacier variations in the past two millennia corresponds with cooling in reconstructed temperature records at the continental and hemispheric scales. The number of glacier advances also broadly matches periods showing high volcanic activity and low solar irradiance over the past two millennia, although the resolution of most glacier chronologies is not enough for robust statistical correlations. Glacier retreat in the past 100-150 years corresponds to the anthropogenic global temperature increase. Many questions concerning the relative strength of forcing factors that drove glacier variations in the past 2 ka still remain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The equipment is 400 km from the nearest Australian Antarctic base and is completely automated. It is expected that there will be sufficient solar power to operate the equipment from January 1998 to May 1998, but the data will not be recovered until the following summer season. The scatter in height computed from the first 25 days of data is +/- 7.5 mm. If such precision is representative of the accuracy of the height estimates, isostatic rebound of < 1 mm/yr will be able to be detected after a few years of observations at the site.

Douglas			Comparison of Hatchery and Field Performance between a Whirling-Disease-Resistant Strain and the Ten Sleep Strain of Rainbow Trout	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												A whirling-disease-resistant strain of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (GRHL strain) derived from a backcross of an F1 hybrid of two strains (German strain x Harrison Lake strain) with German strain females, was compared with the Ten Sleep (TS) strain of rainbow trout. The GRHL strain had consistently superior growth and feed conversion in two consecutive hatchery trials. Hatching and mortality rates were similar between strains. Both strains were stocked into two Utah reservoirs (Hyrum, Porcupine), and a third, Causey Reservoir, was monitored as a control for seasonal variation in prevalence of Myxobolus cerebralis. A total of 1,323 salmonids captured by gill net in spring and fall sampling between 2006 and 2008 were tested for M. cerebralis via pepsin-trypsin digest methods. Only eight of these (<1% per species) had clinical signs consistent with whirling disease. In both reservoirs, GRHL survived better than the TS and had higher growth rates. The prevalence of M. cerebralis was significantly lower for GRHL (18.1%) than TS (50.0%) in Porcupine Reservoir. In Hyrum Reservoir the trend was similar, but prevalence was lower and did not significantly differ between GRHL (9.6%) and TS (23.1%). For infected fish, no significant differences were observed between strains in myxospore counts in either Hyrum (GRHL = 911-28,244 spores/fish [spf], TS = 1,822-155,800 spf) or Porcupine (GRHL = 333-426,667spf, TS = 333-230,511 spf) reservoirs. Unmarked rainbow trout in both reservoirs had significantly higher myxospore counts than stocked fish of either strain. There were significant differences in M. cerebralis prevalence and myxospore loads among other naturally reproducing salmonids in the reservoirs. The trend in susceptibility was cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii > kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka > brown trout Salmo trutta. The GRHL performed well in both hatchery and field settings and is recommended for stocking programs.					; Wagner, Ernst/A-7435-2012; Bartley, Matt/LMP-9014-2024	, Matt Bartley/0009-0003-7104-2531; 													0899-7659	1548-8667					2012	24	2					110	120		10.1080/08997659.2012.675938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08997659.2012.675938								22838082					WOS:000308130700007
J	Yu, SY; Colman, SM; Lai, ZP				Yu, Shi-Yong; Colman, Steven M.; Lai, Zhong-Ping			Late-Quaternary history of 'great lakes' on the Tibetan Plateau and palaeoclimatic implications - A review	BOREAS												Geomorphic evidence suggests that shorelines of 100-200 m above the modern lake levels were common across the Tibetan Plateau during late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The timing of this lake-level highstand is mainly based on radiocarbon ages. Problems surrounding the ages of lacustrine sediments at or beyond the limit of the radiocarbon-dating method have created a need for alternative geochronometers. Chronological advances during the last decade have renewed interest in the timing of events beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating. Here, we synthesize published data for elevated lacustrine landforms of 48 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, in order to provide a thorough perspective on the timing and pattern of lake-level changes in this alpine area during the late Quaternary. The ages of these elevated shore features reveal a long-term trend of relative lake-level fall from at least MIS 5, instead of a peak in MIS 3, as previously thought. Dating lacustrine terrace sequences reveals that the rate of lake-level fall ranged from similar to 1 to 3 mm a(-1), comparable with that of related river downcutting across the plateau. Palaeoclimatic proxy records point to a sustained drying since the Last Interglacial, suggesting that long-term aridification might be the culprit for this widespread and progressive lake-level fall.					; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024; Colman, Steven/E-4658-2012	Lai, Zhongping/0000-0002-0139-9346; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2019	48	1					1	19		10.1111/bor.12349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12349													WOS:000454203700001

Factors Influencing Short-Term Hooking Mortality of Bluegills and the Implications for Restrictive Harvest Regulations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Angling can adversely affect populations of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. and many state agencies have begun to explore restrictive creel and length limits. The fate of released fish can be influenced by a variety of factors. and the Success of regulations Could be reduced if the mortality of released bluegills is high. We conducted experiments using bluegills caught by the general angling public in Ridge Lake, Illinois, to quantify bluegill hooking mortality and test for the effects of bait type (live versus artificial), season (spring versus summer). retention time in live wells (1, 3, or 5 h). and retention gears (live wells versus fish baskets). Across all seasons and baits, the mortality of caught-and-released bluegills was 101,v the initial and short-term mortality for fish immediately released was, 4.4%. There were significant differences in hooking mortality with respect to bait type. retention gear, and retention time. Bluegills caught Oil live bait experienced higher mortality (6.6%) than those caught on artificial baits (0%). and wire fish baskets caused higher mortality (34.0%) than live wells (7.6%). The mortality of bluegills held in live wells was higher for the 3- and 5-h retention times than for the I-It treatment. The probability of dying from catch and release decreased with increasing fish length. We applied Our results 10 a bluegill population under it restrictive harvest regulation consisting of a 203-mm minimum size limit and,I 10-fish daily bag limit. Under these restrictive regulations, fish lost front catch and release represented 27.4% of the total kill (harvest and hooking mortality).

J	Kutzbach, J; Bonan, G; Foley, J; Harrison, SP				Kutzbach, J; Bonan, G; Foley, J; Harrison, SP			Vegetation and soil feedbacks on the response of the African monsoon to orbital forcing in the early to middle Holocene	NATURE												FOSSIL pollen, ancient lake sediments and archaeological evidence from Africa indicate that the Sahel and Sahara regions were considerably wetter than today during the early to middle Holocene period, about 12,000 to 5,000 years ago(1-4). Vegetation associated with the modern Sahara/Sahel boundary was about 5 degrees farther north, and there were more and larger lakes between 15 and 30 degrees N. Simulations with climate models have shown that these wetter conditions were probably caused by changes in Earth's orbital parameters that increased the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere, enhanced the land-ocean temperature contrast, and thereby strengthened the African summer monsoon(5-7). However, these simulations underestimated the consequent monsoon enhancement as inferred from palaeorecords(4). Here,ve use a climate model to show that changes in vegetation and soil may have increased the climate response to orbital forcing, We find that replacing today's orbital forcing with that of the mid-Holocene increases summer precipitation by 12% between 15 and 22 degrees N. Replacing desert with grassland, and desert soil with more loamy soil, further enhances the summer precipitation (by 6 and 10% respectively), giving a total precipitation increase of 28%. When the simulated climate changes are applied to a biome model, vegetation becomes established north of the current Sahara/Sahel boundary, thereby shrinking the area of the Sahara by 11% owing to orbital forcing alone, and by 20% owing to the combined influence of orbital forcing and the prescribed vegetation and soil changes, The inclusion of the vegetation and soil feedbacks thus brings the model simulations and palaeovegetation observations into closer agreement.					; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; 													0028-0836					DEC 19	1996	384	6610					623	626		10.1038/384623a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/384623a0													WOS:A1996VZ29600028

Leptocythere pseudoproboscidea n.sp., collected in a spring is very close to Leptocythere proboscidea Klie, 1939, an endemic species of the Ohrid Lake. Paralimnocythere karamani (Petkovski, 1960) occurred in two localities : river and spring. Until now, this species was considered endemic in the Ohrid-Prespa region. Its known distribution is non extended westwards and its presence in Skadar Valley confirms exchanges between faunas of Ohrid and Skadar drainage areas.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					1999	35	2					123	132		10.1051/limn/1999017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1999017													WOS:000080940900005

Due to anthropogenic changes, increasing amounts of organic and inorganic compounds are entering aquatic systems from surrounding catchment areas, increasing both nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC), and water color with societal, as well as ecological consequences. Several studies have focused on the ability of wetlands to reduce nutrients, whereas data on their potential to reduce TOC and water color are scarce. Here we evaluate wetlands as a potential multifunctional tool for mitigating both eutrophication and brownification. Therefore, we performed a study for 18 months in nine wetlands allowing us to estimate the reduction in concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), TOC and water color. We show that wetland reduction efficiency with respect to these variables was generally higher during summer, but many of the wetlands were also efficient during winter. We also show that some, but not all, wetlands have the potential to reduce TOC, water color and nutrients simultaneously. However, the generalist wetlands that reduced all four parameters were less efficient in reducing each of them than the specialist wetlands that only reduced one or two parameters. In a broader context, generalist wetlands have the potential to function as multifunctional tools to mitigate both eutrophication and brownification of aquatic systems. However, further research is needed to assess the design of the generalist wetlands and to investigate the potential of using several specialist wetlands in the same catchment.

Both light extinction (inhibits primary production) and nutrient availability (stimulates primary production) are positively and nonlinearly related to DOC concentration. These nonlinearities create a threshold DOC concentration (4.8mg L-1), below which the DOC-primary production relationship is positive, and above which the relationship is negative. DOC concentration varies maximally between regions, creating a unimodal relationship between primary production and DOC that emerges at broader scales because arctic lakes largely fall below the threshold DOC concentration, but boreal lakes fall above it. Our analysis suggests that the impact of DOC trends on lake primary production will vary across lakes and regions as a result of contrasting baseline conditions relative to the DOC threshold.

The climate of the study region was deeply controlled by the East Asian summer monsoon. The results indicate that, in the past 15 400 yrs, the values of chemical index of alteration (CIA) ranged from 73.9% to 88.2% (mean: 85.3%), suggested a medium and high intensity of chemical weathering. The local exogenous clastic materials, which were derived from the weathered residues, played a key role in contributing towards the sediments. Since the climate-induced chemical weathering exerted strong influences on the geochemical features of weathered residues, the geochemical characteristics of the sediments were deeply impacted by climatic conditions. Wetter and warmer conditions would favor increased chemical weathering, resulting in more leaching of soluble and mobile elements (e.g., Ba and Sr) and leaving the resistant and immobile elements (e.g., Al and Ti) enriched in the weathered residues. These materials were then eroded and transported into the lake, and led to the sediments characterized by the characteristic of having depleted soluble elements. In contrast, dry and cold conditions would result in an opposite trend. In this sense, the geochemical records can serve as proxies to indicate changes of chemical weathering intensity, which were closely related to the evolution of summer monsoon.					shang, shang/IYS-8177-2023; Wang, Bing-Xiang/HJH-6783-2023; Wei, Zhiqiang/KDN-1700-2024														1002-0063	1993-064X				JUN	2022	32	3					537	548		10.1007/s11769-022-1282-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-022-1282-4													WOS:000804749100012

The dataset covered nearly three years, from October 1998 to June 2001, and included 160,000 observations. The objectives of the tagging were to obtain temperature data to refine bioenergetics models of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) predation on lake trout, and compare the temperatures occupied by strains of lake trout stocked in Lake Huron. The seasonal, thermal-use profiles of lake trout followed the general warming and cooling pattern of Lake Huron. During periods when the zone of surface water mixing extended below the depth range occupied by lake trout, variability among individual fish and strains was low and followed surface temperature. However, during the period of summer stratification, the average temperatures occupied varied substantially among individual fish and strains. Strains originating from the upper Great Lakes (Lake Superior and Lewis Lake, WY) occupied similar temperatures. Between June and mid August, upper Great Lakes lake trout typically occupied water several degrees warmer than that occupied by lake trout of Finger Lakes, New York origin. Most of the lake trout occupied summer temperatures lower than the preferred temperatures suggested by laboratory studies. In October, all strains occupied water as warm or warmer than that occupied in summer, which may partially explain the higher lethality of sea lamprey attacks during October.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			347	361		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70499-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70499-7													WOS:000221321300026

The diagnostic investigation carried out led to the identification of Koi Herpesvirus (KHV) as the etiologic agent. Following this disease outbreak and its socio-economic consequences, the local authorities, in agreement with the local Fishing Association, decided to implement a surveillance program for the achievement of KHV-free health status (Category I) in the Province, in accordance to the Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1554. The selected area was a defined geographical compartment (the Monticolo lakes compartment, South Tyrol, Italy), which is located near Lake Caldaro, where the Koi Herpesvirus disease (KHVD) outbreak had occurred. This area is of particular interest because it supplies other water bodies with juvenile C. carpio individuals; with the achievement of a KHV-free health status, South Tyrol could possibly become independent in the breeding of this fish species. Suitable samples were collected and processed during a two-year period in order to detect the presence/absence of KHV. The same samples were tested for other viruses that can affect carp, namely spring viraemia of carp (SVCV) and carp edema virus (CEV). According to the results, the authors conclude that the Monticolo lakes area should be classified as KHV-free, as no sample has tested positively for the presence of this specific virus (KHV).					; Tavella, Alexander/AAX-9197-2021; TOFFAN, ANNA/AAW-8725-2020; Bettini, Astrid/AAY-2035-2021	Colorio, Stefano/0000-0003-1528-3341; Toffan, Anna/0000-0003-4389-3489; Tavella, Alexander/0000-0001-8565-9987													0167-5877	1873-1716				AUG	2020	181								105089	10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105089								32652354					WOS:000564719200010
J	Walsby, AE; Schanz, F; Schmid, M				Walsby, AE; Schanz, F; Schmid, M			The Burgundy-blood phenomenon: a model of buoyancy change explains autumnal waterblooms by Planktothrix rubescens in Lake Zurich	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Buoyancy changes of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens- the Burgundy-blood alga - were modelled from its buoyancy response to light and irradiance changes in Lake Zurich during autumnal mixing. The daily insolation received by filaments at fixed depths and circulating to different depths was calculated from the measured light attenuation and surface irradiance. The active mixing depth, z(a5), was determined from the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient, K-z, calculated from the wind speed, heat flux and temperature gradients. The fixed depth resulting in filament buoyancy, z(n), decreased from 13 to 2 m between August and December 1998; the critical depth for buoyancy, z(q), to which filaments must be circulated to become buoyant, decreased from > 60 m in the summer to < 10 m in winter. When z(a5) first exceeded z(n), in September, P. rubescens was mixed into the epilimnion. In October, z(q) > z(a5): circulating filaments would have lost buoyancy in the high insolation. Often in November and December, after deeper mixing and lower insolation, z(a5) > z(q): filaments would have become buoyant but would have floated to the lake surface (the Burgundy-blood phenomenon) only under subsequent calm conditions, when K-z was low. The model explains the Burgundy-blood phenomenon in deeper lakes; waterblooms near shallow leeward shores arise from populations floating up in deeper regions of the lake.

LST is also strongly related to the mean temperature of the upper stratum which plays an important role in lake's biology depending, among other factors, on the dynamics of phytoplankton and thence of chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a). Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool to study these two bio-physical parameters by providing synoptically data at spatial/temporal resolutions not achievable with traditional techniques. In this study MODIS and MERIS data are used to assess LST and chl-a concentration in two important Italian lakes. I mages data of Lake Garda in the time range from 2004 to 2009 and of Lake Trasimeno from 2005 to 2008 were used. The complexities of processes dealing with lacustrine ecosystems is reflected by the weak of correlation found between chl-a and LST in both lakes by using the entire dataset. However, by considering the time of the year with highest biological activity (i.e. from the end of spring to mid of summer) a positive correlation (r>0.5) was found between the two parameters in Lake Trasimeno. This behaviour was also observed in Lake Garda by considering LST and chl-a data from different areas. In particular the shallower south-east basin of Lake Garda was characterised by higher LST and chl-a concentrations.					; Boschetti, Luigi/C-6198-2008; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Boschetti, Luigi/0000-0001-6525-4413; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988													1129-8596						2011	43	3					49	62		10.5721/ItJRS20114334	http://dx.doi.org/10.5721/ItJRS20114334													WOS:000302401300005

A vaccinated and control-study population of 3355 Navy recruits in training, as well as other populations, were affected. During the epidemic, 83-90% reduction in febrile respiratory illness was associated with prior inoculation with a monovalent Asian-influenza vaccine. A similar 21-46% reduction was associated with prior inoculation with a polyvalent influenzal vaccine not containing the Asian strain. Although a marked protective effect was noted as early as 10 days after inoculation, a slight beneficial result was noted before that time. No untoward reactions to the vaccine were observed. It is concluded that the Asian influenza vaccine was highly efficacious under the conditions of use at Great Lakes in the fall season of 1957.																			0028-4793	1533-4406					1958	259	21					1005	1009		10.1056/NEJM195811202592103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM195811202592103								13600612					WOS:A1958WB25600003

We studied the population dynamics of 0+ fish in a eutrophic gravel pit lake in which predation of 0+ Eurasian perch on other 0+ fish was suspected to influence perch growth and the structure of the fish community, with effects on the lake food web. 2. The adult fish community was dominated by piscivorous species, especially perch, and the 0+ fish community was dominated by perch and bream. Bream grew to a total length of 80 mm between May and the end of August, gradually decreased in numbers during the summer, and completely disappeared in autumn. Stomach analysis revealed that 0+ perch greater than or equal to28 mm fed on 0+ bream. 3. The initially unimodal cohort of 0+ perch gradually broadened and became bimodal by the end of July. Fish of the larger, piscivorous cohort grew faster (1.4 mm day(-1)) than the smaller, zooplankton-consuming fish (0.6 mm day(-1)). Although individuals of both cohorts later consumed zooplankton and grew at similar rates (0.5 mm day(-1)), only perch of the large cohort (mean TL 125 mm) were found by mid-October. Intraspecific competition for food or cannibalism of older perch may have contributed to the disappearance of the smaller perch. 4. Early piscivory of the fast-growing 0+ perch apparently resulted in the disappearance of 0+ bream by the end of the growing season and precocious maturation of male perch. In contrast to findings in other studies, these large 0+ perch thus avoided the juvenile bottleneck by switching to piscivory early during their ontogenetic development. 5. The observations of this study suggest that early piscivory of 0+ perch can have a long-lasting impact on fish communities in eutrophic lakes, particularly if prey fish are abundant and the structural complexity of the lake is low. Furthermore, early piscivory of 0+ perch may help prevent the expected increase in 0+ cyprinids following reduction of adult cyprinids, which is considered important to ensure the long-term success of biomanipulation experiments.

The analysis included chemical analyses, Rn-222 and Ra-226 levels as well as total Uranium contents. Rn-222 levels were determined only for hot springs. The concentrations of Radium and Uranium in all water resources of Ardabil province were determined by the collector chamber and fluorimetric methods, respectively. The Radium and Uranium concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 300 mBq L-1 and from 1.4 to 280 ppb, respectively. Furthermore, the annual effective dose varied between 8 and 47 mu S y(-1). The reason for variations of Radium and Uranium concentration is the diverse geological structures in Ardabil province. The aim of this study was to determine the level of natural radioactivity in all water resources of the Ardabil province and whether this radiation causes any danger to health. The hot springs were found to have high level of activities and some water resources in Meshkin-Shahr city had the highest activities among other cities in Ardabil province.

Nearshore habitat associations of stocked American eel, Anguilla rostrata, in Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Approximately 3.9 million glass and elver stage American eels (Anguilla rostrata), life stages never before represented in Lake Ontario, were stocked into two locations, the upper St. Lawrence River and the Bay of Quinte, to help recover a segment of the panmictic population under severe decline. We characterized near-shore patterns of abundance and size and indicated habitat associations in the two stocking locations. Generalized additive models identified that in spring, eel presence was positively associated with the percentage of soft (organic or silt) substrate, and negatively associated with gravel substrate. In the fall, eel presence was positively associated with rubble substrate. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated eel habitat preferences that change as eels grow, and that these preferences do not vary with season. Small eels (<150-250 mm) preferred coarse substrates (gravel, cobble, and boulder) whereas larger eels (351-450 mm) preferred silt substrates with moderate macrophyte cover located in deeper water (0.7 -> m). These habitat shifts are likely due to a combination of physical space requirements, habitat availability and prey preference changing with increasing body size. The availability of suitable habitats differed between main stocking locations, yet neither location had an ideal mix of coarse substrates (for smaller eels) and fine substrates (for larger eels). The observed habitat shifts resulted in the stocked American eels utilizing an array of habitats, fitting the general view of the species as a habitat generalist, but it is apparent that in the Great Lakes eels use specific substrate features that change with increasing length.

J	MCCOWN, DL				MCCOWN, DL			DIFFERENTIAL TRACING OF OILY WASTE AND THE ASSOCIATED WATER MASS BY TAGGING WITH RARE-EARTHS	WATER RESEARCH												A method was developed for tagging oily waste with dysprosium and the associated fresh-water with samarium. Neutron activation analysis permitted determination of rare earth concentrations as low as 40 ng l-1 in 15 ml water samples. Shipboard sampling procedures were developed that allowed measurement of the 3-dimensional distribution of the spreading wastes and associated water. The method was applied in 2 field experiments that involved tracing oily wastes and polluted water from the Indiana Harbor Canal (IHC) into Lake Michigan [USA]. For a summer, floating-plume experiment, about 1400 shipboard samples were collected. Employment of the dual-tracer technique led to the following results. After artificial mixing into the water column by a passing ship, the tagged oil did not immediately resurface, and there were no distinguishable differences between the movement of the oil and water over 4 km of travel. During a winter, sinking-plume experiment, 1200 lake-water samples were collected from a boat and from the raw-water intakes of Chicago''s South Water Filtration Plant (SWFP, Illinois, USA). These data provided positive evidence of the intake of IHC effluent and oily waste at the SWFP. The different tracers for the oily waste and underlying water gave evidence of separate pathways to the SWFP, reflecting differing transport modes for surface and near-bottom waters.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1979	13	11					1065	1076		10.1016/0043-1354(79)90071-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(79)90071-X													WOS:A1979HP19200005
J	BURNS, NM				BURNS, NM			NUTRIENT BUDGETS FOR LAKE ERIE, 1970	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Budgets for the quantities of water, Cl-, and P entering and leaving Lake Erie [Canada, USA] during the year of 1970 were developed. The P budget was broken down into basin budgets which were further subdivided into epilimnion budgets for the central and eastern basins. Epilimnion budgets for soluble inorganic N (SIN) and soluble reactive silica (SRS) were also developed. The average coefficients of elimination by sedimentation of the P within each basin were 4.0, 0.38, and 0.18%/day for the western, central and eastern basins, respectively. The P elimination was inversely related to mean basin depth but directly related to the P concentration of the water. The epilimnion budgets showed that during the summer the internal loading of SRS to the epilimnion was greater than the uptake of SRS by phytoplankton growth. The epilimnion budget of SIN demonstrated a massive uptake of the material during the summer, which was only partially replenished. The loss rate of P from the central and eastern basin epilimnia decreased as the summer progressed, to the extent that there was a net gain of P in the eastern basin epilimnion toward the end of the summer. This resulted from significant upward transport of P from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion by flagellate species of phytoplankton.																									1976	33	3					520	536		10.1139/f76-070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-070													WOS:A1976BJ94800013

Spatial and Temporal Variation in Methane Concentrations, Fluxes, and Sources in Lakes in Arctic Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate warming may lead to a positive feedback of increased emissions of CH4 from sediments beneath Arctic lakes, but the contribution of these lakes to the global CH4 budget is poorly quantified. Here we present results of a study of CH4 concentrations and sources from a series of 50 lakes in Arctic Alaska across an 80,000km(2) spatial gradient and a 2year time period. We measured dissolved CH4 concentrations and stable isotopes of CH4 in lakes in the North Slope of Alaska in August 2014 and 2015 and April 2015 (under ice). Stable isotopes indicated that biogenic CH4 dominated versus thermogenic sources, with both acetate fermentation and carbonate reduction sources. Dissolved CH4 was about 100 times higher under the ice than during the summer, indicating that the spring ice off period is a large source of atmospheric CH4. Open-water dissolved CH4 concentrations had a negative relationship with latitude in both years of our study, although CH4 fluxes were consistent among a subset of lakes measured along a similar to 150km north to south transect in both years (14 lakes in 2014 and 12 in 2015). Dissolved CH4 concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher in August 2015 versus August 2014, concurrent with a 3 degrees C higher mean water temperature in 2015 versus 2014. Much longer-term monitoring is needed, however, to conclude that CH4 emissions from Arctic lakes mirror observed warming trends. This study provides valuable baseline data and can inform methods for future studies investigating carbon cycle-climate change feedbacks in Alaskan Arctic lakes.

Characteristics of the Spring Migration of Some Bird Species on the Southeastern Coast of Lake Baikal	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Changes in the timing of bird migration can be tracked if there is data on the timing of bird migration collected by the same methodology. Bird ringing is a source of such data. The combination of two methods of registering migration parameters-observation and catching-provides more accurate data on the first meeting of migratory species in the study area. This article deals with three parameters of spring migration: the first registration, the median of migration, and the last registration of the species (average values for 2015-2018) for 48 species of migratory birds according to capture and observation data around the Baikal Bird Ringing Station (the southeastern coast of Lake Baikal). A comparison of the dates of the beginning of spring migration for 17 bird species in some areas around Lake Baikal (Irkutsk oblast and southeastern and northeastern coasts of Lake Baikal) showed that 13 bird species arrive on the southeastern coast 2-20 days earlier. It is determined that changes in the dates of the first registration between years are insignificant for 13 species of birds (+/-3 days). These species are most promising for the long-term monitoring of climate and population changes.

Comparison of macroinvertebrate community structure and driving environmental factors in natural and wastewater treatment ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Eutrophication still continues to be an issue of major concern for the protection of water quality, and accordingly, the European Union Water Framework Directive has set a minimum target for all waters where "good status" is defined as a slight departure from the biological community which would be expected in conditions of minimal anthropogenic impact. The use of constructed ponds for wastewater treatment aimed at achieving this target has shown to be an effective alternative to conventional systems in the farm landscape. Their applicability in these areas is of great interest since these ponds have the added potential to combine their wastewater treatment properties with that of biodiversity enhancement. This article focuses on exploring the community structure of both natural and constructed ponds used for wastewater treatment and the driving environmental factors. A total of 15 constructed and 5 natural ponds were sampled for aquatic macroinvertebrates and hydrochemistry in spring and summer 2006. Results showed that the most important factors responsible for the differences in the community structure between these two types of ponds were pH, vegetation structure and pollution levels. These gradients helped to structure a large proportion of the communities with some taxa being associated with the constructed ponds. These results highlight the potential contribution of constructed ponds used for wastewater treatment to the landscape biodiversity. The present findings also open the possibility for a more integrated management of water quality and biodiversity enhancement in farmland areas.					; Gioria, Margherita/G-6390-2014	Baars, Jan-Robert/0000-0002-3222-811X; Kelly-Quinn, Mary/0000-0002-0110-5360; Gioria, Margherita/0000-0002-0574-4688													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2009	634	1					153	165		10.1007/s10750-009-9900-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9900-z													WOS:000269190100013
J	Arnold, RJ; Convey, P				Arnold, RJ; Convey, P			The life history of the diving beetle, Lancetes angusticollis (Curtis) (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), on sub-Antarctic South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												Two populations of the world's most southerly diving beetle (Lancetes angusticollis) were studied on sub-Antarctic South Georgia between November 1995 and April 1996. Parallel observations were made on laboratory cultures of each life stage. All juvenile stages of L. angusticollis are voracious predators, preying mainly on the herbivorous copepod Boeckella poppei. Adult beetles additionally predate benthic ostracods. Laboratory predation rates and held population densities found in this study suggest that L. angusticollis has a more significant impact on its prey than recognised in recent studies of South Georgian lakes. Spring field samples contained only a few individuals of larval instar IV and adults. Young larvae were present from December onwards, with a rapid progression through juvenile instars during the summer months. Fourth instar larvae left the water for pupation between mid-December and at least mid-February. Combining these observations with known developmental threshold temperatures for each life stage implies that L. angusticollis has a complex biennial (minimum) life-cycle, with overwintering possible in three life stages [aquatic larvae, terrestrial pupae (not proven) and aquatic adults]. L. angusticollis may be a suitable indicator species in the context of climate warming studies: a small (1 degrees C) rise in mean environmental temperatures, comparable to that already observed at several sub-Antarctic and maritime Antarctic localities, would allow completion of an annual (univoltine) life-cycle, with concomitant rapid population increase, and serious implications for trophic interactions in these simple lake ecosystems.

However, the procession linkage between the WVBs over the TP and its inner basins and IPWP has not been sufficiently elucidated. In this study, the relationship between the summer WVB over the TP and the IPWP was quantitatively investigated using reanalysis datasets and satellite-observed sea surface temperature (SST). The results show that: (1) the mean total summer vapor budget (WVBt) over the TP in the period of 1979-2018 was 72.5 x 10(6)kg s(-1). Additionally, for the 13 basins within the TP, the summer WVB has decreased from southeast to northwest; the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin had the highest WVB (33.7%), followed by the Upper Yangtze River Basin, Ganges River Basin and Qiangtang Plateau. (2) For the past several decades, the WVB(t)over the TP has experienced an increasing trend (3.81 x 10(6)kg s(-1)decade(-1)), although the southern boundary budget (WVBs) contributed the most and is most closely related with the WVBt, while the eastern boundary budget (WVBe) experienced a decreasing trend (4.21 x 10(6)kg s(-1)decade(-1)) which was almost equal to the interdecadal variations of the WVBt. (3) For the IPWP, we defined a new warm pool index of surface latent heat flux (WPI-slhf), and found that an increasing WPI-slhf would cause an anticyclone anomaly in the equatorial western Indian Ocean (near 70 degrees E), resulting in the increased advent of water vapor to the TP. (4) On the interdecadal scale, the correlation coefficients of the variation of the summer WVB(t)over the TP with the WPI-slhf and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) signal were 0.86 and 0.85, respectively (significant at the 0.05% level). Therefore, the warming and the increasing slhf of the IPWP would significantly contribute to the increasing WVB of the TP in recent decades.					; Li, YanY/ABC-3649-2020	Meng, Deli/0000-0002-2275-9427; 														2073-4433				AUG	2020	11	8							828	10.3390/atmos11080828	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080828													WOS:000567082100001

J.; Hahn, Dittmar			Recovery of Salmonella from biofilms in a headwater spring ecosystem	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Salmonellae are pathogenic bacteria often detected in waters impacted by human or animal wastes. In order to assess the fate of salmonellae in supposedly pristine environments, water and natural biofilm samples along with snails (Tarebia granifera) and crayfish (Procambarus clarkia) were collected before and up to 7 days following four precipitation events from sites within the headwater springs of Spring Lake, San Marcos, TX. The samples were analyzed for the presence of salmonellae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after semi-selective enrichment. Salmonellae were detected in one water sample directly after precipitation only, while detection in ten biofilm and two crayfish samples was not related to precipitation. Salmonellae were not detected in snails. Characterization of isolates by rep-PCR revealed shared profiles in water and biofilm samples, biofilm and crayfish samples, and biofilm samples collected 23 days apart. These results suggest that salmonellae are infrequently washed into this aquatic ecosystem during precipitation runoff and can potentially take up residency in biofilms which can help facilitate subsequent long-term persistence and eventual transfer through the food chain.																			1477-8920						2011	9	3					458	466		10.2166/wh.2011.173	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2011.173								21976193					WOS:000293624300004

Assessment of anthropogenic impacts on the trophic dynamics of Babine Lake: Implications for the production of sockeye salmon	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Babine Lake, British Columbia, is Canada's largest sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) nursery lake, sustaining numerous ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries, recreation, cultural and spiritual benefits). The lake and its watershed have experienced significant anthropogenic and natural disturbances since the early 1900's, including extensive logging, pine beetle infestations, mining, fisheries enhancements, and climate change. To help understand the cumulative impacts of local and regional factors on the trophic ecology of this large freshwater ecosystem, we used the paleolimnological approach to reconstruct changes over the past similar to 200 years of primary production (subfossil pigments, diatom microfossils), secondary production (cladoceran zooplankton microfossils) and geochemistry (carbon and nitrogen isotopes, elemental analyses, % organic matter). Between ca. 1950 and the 2000's changes in the sedimentary proxies are consistent with an enhanced influx of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon likely due to the cumulative landscape disturbances and an increase in precipitation. These changes include shifts in diatom composition ca. 1950 to higher abundances and taxa indicative of decreased light penetration and nutrient enrichment. Increases in delta N-15 (similar to +1 parts per thousand) and cladoceran concentrations, concurrent with increasing sockeye salmon escapement post ca. 1975, is indicative of a higher pelagic fish production that occurs concurrently with both fisheries enhancements and sustained higher precipitation. The largest and most abrupt change in algal pigments occurred post ca. 2000, characterized by increases in motile and buoyant algae (i.e., chrysophytes, cryptophytes, colonial cyanobacteria), a time of increasing regional air temperatures, reduced spring and autumn winds, and resultant changes in patterns of lake mixing.

J	Meixner, T; Gupta, HV; Bastidas, LA; Bales, RC				Meixner, T; Gupta, HV; Bastidas, LA; Bales, RC			Sensitivity analysis using mass flux and concentration	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Sensitivity analysis for hydrochemical models requires consideration of the multivariate nature of watershed response. A robust multiobjective generalized sensitivity analysis (MOGSA) procedure, recently developed at the University of Arizona, was used to fully investigate the single objective parameter sensitivity of the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM). A total of 20000 simulations for a two-year period were conducted for the Emerald Lake watershed in Sequoia National Park, California. For each simulation 21 objective functions were evaluated: they were discharge and both concentration and mass flux for ten chemical species. The MOGSA procedure revealed that only 2000 simulations were necessary to establish the parameters sensitive to mass flux or concentration. We found significant differences in parameter sensitivity for concentration versus mass flux objective functions. For example, a snowpack elution parameter and a number of hydrologic parameters were sensitive for Cl- concentration, while only the snowpack elution parameter was sensitive for Cl- mass flux. By using mass flux instead of concentration fewer mineral weathering parameters and more soil exchange parameters were sensitive. Mass flux calculations emphasize the spring snowmelt and peak discharge events of the early summer. Our results indicate that using mass instead of concentration permits better identification of the model parameters that most affect stream conditions during peak springtime flows and that some combination of mass flux and concentration objectives should be used in evaluating model performance.

The automatic submersible water sampler described here is small, lightweight, actuated by a microprocessor, and inexpensively and easily constructed. The sampler consists of a pressure case, sample containers constructed of 10 spring-loaded 60 mL syringes connected to solenoid valves, and electronics to control opening and closing of the solenoid valves. Vacuum in the syringes keeps the springs compressed while the solenoid valves are closed. When a valve opens, the spring expands and draws water past a screen and/or filter into the syringe. Once the syringe is filled, the solenoid valve closes, storing the sample. More than one syringe can be opened simultaneously if more than 60 mL are required. Preservatives can be added to the syringe prior to deployment. Some environments where it could be used include karst aquifers, lakes, large rivers, and estuaries.

J	Liu, M; Wang, L; Qiu, FD				Liu, Miao; Wang, Li; Qiu, Fangdao			Using MODIS data to track the long-term variations of dissolved oxygen in Lake Taihu	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Dissolved oxygen (DO) is crucial for the health of aquatic ecosystems, and plays an essential role in regulating biogeochemical processes in inland lakes. Traditional measurements of DO using the probe or analysis in a laboratory are time-consuming and cannot obtain data with high frequency and broad coverage. Satellites can provide daily/hourly observations within a broad scale and have been used as an important technique for aquatic environments monitoring. However, satellite-derived DO in waters is challenging due to its non-optically active property. Here, we developed a two-step model for retrieving DO concentration in Lake Taihu from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua images. A machine learning model (eXtreme gradient boosting) was developed to estimate DO from field water temperature, water clarity, and chlorophyll-a (Chla) (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.98 mg L-1, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 7.9%) and subsequently was validated on MODIS-derived water temperature, water clarity, and Chla matchups with a satisfactory accuracy (RMSE = 1.28 mg L-1, MAPE = 9.9%). MODIS-derived DO in Lake Taihu from 2002 to 2021 demonstrated that DO ranged from 7.2 mg L-1 to 14.2 mg L-1, with a mean value of 9.3 mg L-1. DO in the northern region was higher than in the central and southern regions, and higher in winter than in summer. We revealed that DO in this decade (2010-2021) was considerably lower than that in the last decade (2002-2009). Meanwhile, annual mean of DO increased in 2002-2009 and decreased from 2010 to 2021. The spatial distribution of DO in Lake Taihu was related to Chla and water clarity, while seasonal and interannual variations in DO resulted from air temperature primarily. This research enhances the potential use of machine learning approaches in monitoring non-optically active constituents from satellite imagery and indicates the possibility of long-term and high-range variations in more water quality parameters in lakes.

Seasonality of cladoceran and bryozoan resting stage δ13C values and implications for their use as palaeolimnological indicators of lacustrine carbon cycle dynamics	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The stable carbon isotope composition, expressed as delta C-13 values, of chitinous resting stages of planktivorous invertebrates can provide information on past changes in carbon cycling in lakes. For example, the delta C-13 values of cladoceran ephippia and bryozoan statoblasts have been used to estimate the past contribution of methane-derived carbon to lake food webs and variations in the delta C-13 value of planktonic algae. Limited information, however, is available concerning seasonal variations in delta C-13 values of these organisms and their resting stages. We measured the seasonal variation in delta C-13 values of Daphnia (Branchiopoda: Cladocera: Daphniidae) and their floating ephippia over a 2-year period in small, dimictic Lake Gerzensee, Switzerland. Floating ephippia of Ceriodaphnia (Branchiopoda: Cladocera: Daphniidae) and statoblasts of Plumatella (Phylactolaemata: Plumatellida: Plumatellidae) were analysed during parts of this period. Furthermore, delta C-13 values of remains from all three organism groups were analysed in a 62-cm-long sediment core. Throughout the year, Daphnia delta C-13 values tracked the delta C-13 values of particulate organic matter (POM), but were more negative than POM, indicating that Daphnia also utilize a relatively C-13-depleted carbon source. Daphnia ephippia delta C-13 values did not show any pronounced seasonal variation, suggesting that they are produced batch-wise in autumn and/or spring and float for several months. In contrast, delta C-13 values of Ceriodaphnia ephippia and Plumatella statoblasts followed variations in delta C-13(POM) values, Ceriodaphnia values being the most negative of the resting stages. Average cladoceran ephippia delta C-13 values in the flotsam agreed well with ephippia values from Gerzensee surface sediments. In contrast, average Plumatella statoblast delta C-13 values from the flotsam were 4aEuro degrees more negative than in the surface sediments. In the sediment core, delta C-13 values of the two cladocerans remained low (mean -39.0 and -41.9aEuro degrees) throughout the record. In contrast, Plumatella had distinctly less negative delta C-13 values (mean -32.0aEuro degrees). Our results indicate that in Gerzensee, Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia strongly relied on a C-13-depleted food source throughout the past 150 years, most likely methane-oxidising bacteria, whereas this food source was not a major contribution to the diet of bryozoans.					van Hardenbroek, Maarten/R-1590-2017; Szidat, Sönke/D-6706-2011; Morlock, Marina/GPK-4978-2022; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	van Hardenbroek, Maarten/0000-0001-6330-6363; Morlock, Marina A./0000-0001-6495-8267; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2017	57	2					141	156		10.1007/s10933-016-9936-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9936-9													WOS:000394266100003

Pre-impoundment fish migrations in the Mobile Basin, Alabama	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Assessing the status of several migratory fishes in the Mobile River Basin, Alabama, has been complicated due to a general lack of historical data on their life history, habitat requirements, and distributions. Whether distributions were restricted by natural or man-made barriers to migration is difficult to answer because few scientific collections were made before dams were built, and the earliest dams were built at the largest biogeographic barrier in the basin: the geological fall line. Therefore, we used what information was available, including anecdotal information, primarily records from archived newspapers and government reports, to describe the ranges of six migratory species prior to the construction of dams in the Mobile Basin. We describe the complicated history of Alabama Shad Alosa alabamae and show that range declines may have been masked by the stocking of American Shad Alosa sapidissima in the late 19th century. We show that Gulf Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi probably migrated well above the fall line in the Coosa River, and may have been sympatric with Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens. We found no records of Alabama Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus suttkusi above the fall line. American Eel Anguilla rostrata migrated above the fall line in every Mobile Basin river before dams were built. Finally, Paddlefish Polyodon spathula may have once occurred above the fall line in at least two rivers, but they persist today in impounded reaches in the coastal plain, unlike some other species. We hope that future work will continue to consider archival sources of information to re-trace the histories of imperilled species.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2024	33	2								10.1111/eff.12771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12771		FEB 2024											WOS:001172953500001

Ozone distributions over southern Lake Michigan: comparisons between ferry-based observations, shoreline-based DOAS observations and model forecasts	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Air quality forecast models typically predict large summertime ozone abundances over water relative to land in the Great Lakes region. While each state bordering Lake Michigan has dedicated monitoring systems, offshore measurements have been sparse, mainly executed through specific short-term campaigns. This study examines ozone abundances over Lake Michigan as measured on the Lake Express ferry, by shoreline differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) observations in southeastern Wisconsin and as predicted by the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. From 2008 to 2009 measurements of O-3, SO2, NO2 and formaldehyde were made in the summertime by DOAS at a shoreline site in Kenosha, WI. From 2008 to 2010 measurements of ambient ozone were conducted on the Lake Express, a high-speed ferry that travels between Milwaukee, WI, and Muskegon, MI, up to six times daily from spring to fall. Ferry ozone observations over Lake Michigan were an average of 3.8 ppb higher than those measured at shoreline in Kenosha, with little dependence on position of the ferry or temperature and with greatest differences during evening and night. Concurrent 1-48 h forecasts from the CMAQ model in the upper Midwestern region surrounding Lake Michigan were compared to ferry ozone measurements, shoreline DOAS measurements and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) station measurements. The bias of the model O-3 forecast was computed and evaluated with respect to ferry-based measurements. Trends in the bias with respect to location and time of day were explored showing non-uniformity in model bias over the lake. Model ozone bias was consistently high over the lake in comparison to land-based measurements, with highest biases for 25-48 h after initialization.					; Tang, Youhua/D-5205-2016; Brown, Steven/I-1762-2013	Fillingham, Joseph/0000-0002-7749-8092; Bootsma, Harvey/0000-0002-9690-0155; Tang, Youhua/0000-0001-7089-7915; Cleary, Patricia/0000-0003-2660-5166; 													1680-7316	1680-7324					2015	15	9					5109	5122		10.5194/acp-15-5109-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-5109-2015													WOS:000355289100009

Equilibrium phases sensu Sommer et al. (1993) were found only in 17 lakes. Most of them were under some kind (high salt content or very low level of nutrients) of stress factor. It is concluded that environmental stress forces phytoplankton communities towards equilibrium. No relationship between occurrence of equilibria and trophic state was found. Species number of non-equilibrated lakes was almost three times as high as those in equilibrium. Of the 31 recently described (Reynolds et al., 2002) phytoplankton assemblages most of those were recognized that are likely to occur in shallow lakes. Separation of a functional group W-S from W2 for Synura dominated lakes is suggested. It seemed also necessary to raise a group (Y-Ph) for lakes dominated by Phacotus. Sorting of Dinophyta species into different already described functional groups is desirable.

Long-term variations in orographic rainfall: analysis and implications for upland catchments	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Climatic changes could alter the frequency and magnitude of rainfall events and the distribution of rainfall with altitude, with important consequences for management of aquatic ecosystems, water resources and flood risk. This study investigates changes in observed rainfall amounts across a range of altitudes in the Lake District region, northwest England, and spatial and temporal changes to the orographic "rainshadow" effect. Between the 1970s and 1990s there have been marked changes to the seasonality of precipitation, such that winters have become wetter, and increasingly dominated by heavy precipitation events. The intensity of these events has increased most markedly at higher-elevation sites. Such changes could hinder recovery of sensitive upland sites from acidification and increase the risk of downstream flooding. An inter-decadal weakening of the region's rainshadow suggests a greater proportion of winter precipitation crosses the high-elevation Lake District dome. This is linked to changes in the frequency and character of wet weather patterns.

Phytoplankton communities consisted mainly of small sized Chlorococcalean algae, but Cyanophyceae formed undesirable blooms in summer or late summer. A typical progression from small, fast-growing species to large Dinoflagellates or diatoms, frequently observed in eutrophic stratified lakes, did not occur because of permanent nutrient replenishment, characteristic of shallow waters. High algal standing crop and primary production as well as the appearance of Cyanophyceae was related to important phosphorus inputs from the river Seine and to internal loading which accelerated eutrophication process in the shallow water body. Cyanophyceae decline appeared to be controlled by breakdown of stratification caused by wind.

Influence of glacial turbidity and climate on diatom communities in two Fjord Lakes (British Columbia, Canada)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Inputs of glacial meltwater and changes in climate can profoundly influence lake ecosystems. Anderson and Seton lakes, two morphologically and chemically similar fjord lakes within the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, experience a common biogeoclimatic setting, yet contrasting turbid-water influences from a hydroelectric development which diverts glacially-turbid water into Seton Lake, but not Anderson Lake. We conducted a comparative paleolimnological study of these two lakes to infer climatic and hydro-system influences affecting the freshwater algal community over the past similar to 200 years. Paleolimnological analysis of multiple cores for sedimentary diatom assemblages from Seton Lake revealed substantial diversion-related reductions in diatom concentrations and fluxes following the completion of the Bridge River Diversion (ca. 1950). Diatom compositional changes in Seton Lake were consistent with decreased light penetration due to increased turbidity. These changes did not occur in Anderson Lake, indicating the changes in the Seton Lake cores were likely driven by inflow of the glacially-turbid waters. Both lakes exhibited diatom compositional changes ca. 1980, with a rise in Lindavia comensis coincident with significant increases in local mean annual air temperatures and presumably associated limnological changes. Modern phytoplankton data, collected as part of this study, provides support for the occurrence of different L. comensis morphs throughout the sampling period (May-October) in Anderson Lake and in the fall in Seton Lake. The rise of L. comensis in both Anderson and Seton lakes is conceivably linked to the recent ice-free conditions enabling this taxon to persist throughout the year.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2021	83	1							13	10.1007/s00027-020-00767-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00767-3													WOS:000606855500002
J	Yan, ND; Pawson, TW				Yan, ND; Pawson, TW			Seasonal variation in the size and abundance of the invading Bythotrephes in Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bythotrephes invaded Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada, in the early 1990s. Here we describe seasonal changes in the size, abundance and life history of the invader. The weight of Bythotrephes could be accurately estimated (r(2) = 0.90) from the length of its body and the state of development of its brood, but substantial (22%) corrections for shrinkage in sugarformalin were required. The seasonality of the size and abundance of Bythotrephes was apparently regulated by the interaction of fish predation, temperature-mediated growth, the availability of the invader's prey, and switches in its reproductive biology. The vernal increase in the growth of the Bythotrephes population lagged behind increases in water temperature and abundances of preferred prey, most probably because of predation by lake herring (Coregonus artedi). Bythotrephes abundance increased rapidly in early July; however, the population maximum was brief. After the abundance of their preferred prey crashed in mid-July, Bythotrephes body size declined, and adult females switched from parthenogenic to resting egg production. Population size declined in consequence. In the summer, female Bythotrephes committed most of their energy to growth between instar I and II, but to egg production for instars II and III. The biology of the Harp Lake population differed from that observed in other recently invaded lakes in several ways - the lag in population growth in the spring, the small change in body size between instars II and III, the decline in body size in August, and the co-incident switch by mature females to resting egg production. These inter-lake differences in biology indicate we have more to learn about Bythotrephes before we can predict its influence on the inland lakes of North America.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0018-8158						1998	361						157	168																WOS:000073655800014

Wind and rainfall regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in large, shallow lakes from long-term MODIS observations using a semianalytical model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Knowledge of the variation and regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient is important for management of lake water quality and ecological environments. Data were collected seven times (378 samples) from 2006 to 2011 in Lake Taihu to improve the existing semianalytical model of diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) by measuring in situ K-d(490) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). This semianalytical model was applied to determine the long-term variation of K-d(490) and its driving factors from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Our semianalytical model of K-d(490) improves the retrieval accuracy of K-d(490) from 29.60% to 22.58% (root-mean-square percentage error) and 24.28 +/- 18.54% (mean value +/- standard deviation) to 19.29 +/- 14.34% (mean absolute relative error). The K-d (490) from maps produced from MODIS images clearly present the temporal and spatial variations of K-d(490). This indicates the suitability of using the improved semianalytical model and MODIS to observe K-d(490) in turbid shallow inland waters. Long-term MODIS observation of K-d(490) shows distinct seasonal and spatial variations. Temporally, the highest and the lowest K-d(490) were found in winter and in summer, respectively. Spatially, high K-d(490) values were primarily distributed in the southwestern and northwestern Lake Taihu, and relatively low K-d(490) values were distributed in Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay (the eastern part of the lake and East Bay were excluded in this study due to invalid retrieval results of K-d(490)). Many covarying points were found between K-d(490) and maximum wind speed from long-term observations, suggesting that wind-induced sediment resuspension is the principal driver of high K-d(490). Correlation was also observed between K-d(490) and heavy rainfall events, suggesting the regulating effect of heavy rainfall.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Huang, Tao/C-3315-2014; Zhu, A-Xing/JOZ-4945-2023; Yao, Ling/J-4223-2013	Huang, Tao/0000-0003-4237-7087; huang, changchun/0000-0002-3865-6414; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 16	2017	122	13					6748	6763		10.1002/2017JD026955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JD026955													WOS:000407900300004
J	Henneman, HE; Stefan, HG				Henneman, HE; Stefan, HG			Albedo models for snow and ice on a freshwater lake	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Snow and ice albedo measurements were taken over a freshwater lake in Minnesota for three months during the winter of 1996-1997 for use in a winter lake water quality model. The mean albedo of new snow was measured as 0.83 +/- 0.028, while the mean ice albedo was measured as 0.38 +/- 0.033. The period from December 17, 1996 to February 17, 1997, was marked as the nonmelt, or high albedo, season when albedo decayed at an average rate of 0.02 per day. The melting, or rapid albedo decay, season began on February 18 and continued until the end of the study on March 21. During the melt season the albedo decay rate varied from 0.10 to 0.20 per day. Two albedo models were developed for the entire winter season; they use separate equations for the nonmelt and melt periods. The input data for both models are climatic data. The first model requires daily incident solar radiation, air temperature, and snowfall data as input, while the second model requires daily air temperature and snowfall data only. The models predict albedo with modeling efficiencies of 0.94 and 0.89 for the entire three month period, respectively. The mean absolute error between values observed on the lake surface and values predicted by the model was 0.023 for the first model and 0.029 for the second model. Albedo predictions made by three albedo models given in the literature were also compared to the observed lake surface data. The two models developed herein predicted albedo better than the three existing surface albedo models because they were calibrated to the observed lake surface data. Albedo predictions from both new models and the three existing models were also compared to 11 years of observed surface albedo data collected over land. (No other lake surface observations were available.) The new models reasonably predicted albedo during those winters when the total snowfall depth was greater than 60 cm. The new model predictions for the land data were as good, if not better, than those by the three existing models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we explore the physical, chemical and biological factors influencing the year-to-year variations in the summer biomass of zooplankton collected from the North Basin of Windermere between 1966 and 1991. The most important factor influencing the longterm change in the summer biomass of zooplankton was the progressive enrichment of the lake by treated sewage. Nutrient loadings to the lake increased significantly in the 1970s when many properties were connected to the main sewer. Long-term changes in the numbers of perch present in the lake over the same period appeared to have little effect on the zooplankton biomass, There was no significant correlation between the abundance of zooplankton and the numbers of perch caught (r = -0.04) but the year-class-strength of perch was positively correlated (r = 0.44) with the summer biomass of zooplankton. The most important factor influencing year-to-year variations in the biomass of zooplankton was the early summer weather. Larger biomass was consistently recorded in relatively cool, windy years where the early summer thermocline was relatively unstable and large numbers of edible algae were present in the epilimnion. The summer zooplankton biomass was thus positively correlated with the average wind speed (r = 0.46) and the abundance of edible algae (r = 0.55). However, an even higher proportion of year-to-year variations in zooplankton biomass could be explained by a general "weather" index based on the position of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean (r = -0.59). Latitudinal movements of the Gulf Stream appear to influence the dynamics of the lake by regulating the weather systems that influence the timing and intensity of mixing. Thus "north" Gulf Stream years were characterised by lower average wind speeds, shallower thermoclines, smaller biomass of edible algae and lower concentrations of herbivorous zooplankters, Whilst comparable physical effects have been recorded recently in the seas around the European continental shelf, lake Windermere appears to be a particularly effective integrator of recent climatic trends.																					0-7923-5055-3				1998	42						223	244																WOS:000076501300016
J	Terada, A; Sudo, Y				Terada, Akihiko; Sudo, Yasuaki			Thermal activity within the western-slope geothermal zone of Aso volcano, Japan: Development of a new thermal area	GEOTHERMICS												Since June of 2006, vigorous new fumaroles, accompanied by hydrothermal eruptions, have formed at the Yoshioka hot spring of Aso volcano in Japan. Prior to this date, the hot spring was a minor thermal area, emitting only 0.2 x 10(6) J/s of hot water. The steam flux increased significantly to 15-30 x 10(6) J/s in October 2006. After November 2006, the new fumaroles have maintained a largely constant heat discharge rate of approximately 4.6 x 10(6) J/s (170 tonne/day), which is almost 20 times higher than that of the previous natural thermal activity. Mudslides, earthquakes, and human-related factors did not cause the geothermal events observed at Yoshioka. On the basis of energy estimations, we infer that the hydrothermal eruptions and increased flow have resulted from an increase in the volcanic fluid flux from a deep aquifer to the steam-dominated reservoir beneath Yoshioka.

J	Becker, S; Singh, AK; Postius, C; Böger, P; Ernst, A				Becker, S; Singh, AK; Postius, C; Böger, P; Ernst, A			Genetic diversity and distribution of periphytic Synechococcus spp. in biofilms and picoplankton of Lake Constance	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												In various water depths of the littoral zone of Lake Constance (Bodensee) cyanobacteria of the Synechococcus-type were isolated from biofilms (periphyton) on three natural substrates and an artificial one (unglazed tiles). From one tile three strains of phycocrythrin (PE)-rich Synechococcus spp. were isolated, the first examples of these organisms in the epibenthos. Phylogenetic inference based on the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS-1) assigned all periphytic isolates to two clusters of the picophytoplankton clade (evolutionary lineage VI of cyanobacteria). The sequence divergence in the ITS-I was used to design specific PCR primers to allow direct, culture-independent detection and quantification of isolated Syncehococcus strains in natural periphytic and pelagic samples. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed depth-related differences of Synechococcus spp. distribution on tiles placed in the littoral zone. Synechococcus genotypes were observed which occurred in both the periphyton (oil tiles) and in the pelagic picoplankton. A strain with one of these genotypes, Synechococcus sp. 130 8805, was isolated from the pelagic zone in 1988. Its genotype was found on tiles that had been exposed at different water depths in the littoral zone in spring and autumn of the year 2000. Quantitative analysis with a genotype-specific TaqMan probe and real-time Taq nuclease assays (TNA) confirmed its presence in the pelagic zone, although appearance of this and related genotypes was highly irregular and exhibited strong differences between consecutive years. Our results show that the ability to form significant subpopulations in pelagic and periphytic communities exists in three out of four phylogenetic Clusters of Synechococcits spp. in Lake Constance. This versatility may be a key feature in the ubiquity of the evolutionary lineage VI of cyanobacteria. (C) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SEASONAL PATTERN OF VIRUS ACQUISITION BY THE GRAPE MEALYBUG, PSEUDOCOCCUS MARITIMUS, IN A LEAFROLL-DISEASED VINEYARD	JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												The seasonal acquisition pattern of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) by the grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Erhorn), was determined over two consecutive years in a leafroll-diseased vineyard in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Groups of 1-15 immature mealybugs (1st, 2nd or 3rd instars), adults or eggs were collected from April to November on 20 selected vines infected with GLRaV-1 and/or GLRaV-3. Results of RT-PCR using specific primers were consistent with a preferential virus acquisition by overwintered, 1st instar nymphs in April and May (87%, 45 of 52) followed by summer generation immature mealybugs in July (82%, 28 of 34). Crawlers collected on or near ovisacs in September (100%, 12 of 12) were aviruliferous and eggs collected in June (100%, 250 of 250) as well as crawlers hatching from eggs (100%, 51 of 51) tested negative for the two target viruses in RT-PCR. Importantly, crawlers collected in the vineyard at bud swell in April transmitted GLRaV-1 to healthy grapevines in a greenhouse. These findings suggest that disease management strategies designed to mitigate leafroll spread by reducing vector populations should target overwintered crawlers and second instar crawlers at a very early grapevine development stage, i.e. from bud swell to bloom, as well as the summer generation crawlers later in mid-summer.																			1125-4653	2239-7264				NOV	2015	97	3					503	510																WOS:000367302200012

Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) and Normalized Mean Error (NME) as statistical metrics are used for evaluation the simulation performance. Ozone prediction performance is good, with the 5 sites for summer season having NMB values within +/- 15% and NME values less than 35%.
