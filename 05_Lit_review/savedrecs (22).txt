Research in the Kuruman Hills at the southern edge of the Kalahari in South Africa has recently provided new insights into the complexity and distinctiveness of southern African palaeoclimate. Here we compare these records, obtained from Kathu Pan, Wonderwerk Cave, and Mamatwan Mine, focusing on the presence of water bodies from c. 2 million years before present to the end of the Pleistocene. Through the synthesis of multiple proxies we create a picture of localized water availability as it would have affected hominin adaptation. These records are then framed within a larger discussion of regional climate and environmental change. The emerging record from the southern Kalahari suggests that the distribution of zones of rainfall seasonality varied significantly throughout the Pleistocene and a hominin presence is particularly found in association with wetter phases which supported lakes, springs and pans.

J	VANCE, RE; BEAUDOIN, AB; LUCKMAN, BH				VANCE, RE; BEAUDOIN, AB; LUCKMAN, BH			THE PALEOECOLOGICAL RECORD OF 6 KA BP CLIMATE IN THE CANADIAN PRAIRIE PROVINCES	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Synthesis of available paleoecological studies in the prairie provinces of Canada indicates that although the peak in postglacial aridity that characterized early Holocene climate of the western foothills and plains had passed, conditions remained warmer and drier than present throughout the region ca. 6000 yr BP. Compared to today, treeline elevations were higher and alpine glaciers were reduced in size in the Rocky Mountains, lake levels were lower over much of the Interior Plains, and the grassland and boreal forest ecozones extended north of their present positions. Forest fires were more prevalent ca. 6000 yr BP than they are today, aiding westward migration of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) through the boreal forest and increasing the area occupied by grassland in boreal and montane forest regions. Attempts to quantify the magnitude of 6 ka temperature and precipitation differences have produced variable results, but suggest that mean annual temperature was 0.5 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C higher than today (summer temperature may have been up to 3 degrees C higher) and mean annual precipitation was reduced by 65 mm (or summer precipitation was reduced by 50 mm), compared to present. The nature and scale of these changes suggests that a vigorous zonal atmospheric circulation pattern, similar to that of the 1930s but shifted northward, prevailed at 6 ka.

The formation of the graben in the northern part of the lake has been controlled by the West Sayan fault. The ongoing activity of the fault is evidenced by radon and mercury anomalies whose behavior was investigated by measurements along transects perpendicular to supposed active fault segments by various methods. Radon flux was measured by absorption of radon in activated charcoal. It showed an augmented radon flux above the most prominent fault segments, reflecting enhanced permeability of the fault rocks relative to the country rock. Radon emanation in the soil-gas system was measured by scintillation and electret detectors that show anomalies in soil-gas Rn concentrations over fault zones. The concentration of radon measured in springs marked fault-aligned radon-carrying spring waters. Enhanced concentrations of mercury measured in soil and water along the fault zone indicate an ,,open crack" system allowing gas-carrying fluids to migrate. The performed study confirmed that the West Sayan fault zone is an active structure providing vertical migration of radon and mercury.

J	Abrahamson, WG; Abrahamson, JR				Abrahamson, WG; Abrahamson, JR			Effects of a low-intensity winter fire on long-unburned Florida sand pine scrub	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Fire suppression and habitat fragmentation during the twentieth century have generated many long-unburned stands of relatively isolated sand pine scrub. Such stands often lose most of their endemic herbs as woody species come to dominate. A sand pine scrub stand last burned in 1926 or 1927 was prescription burned in February 1986 after a 1985 vegetation census and then was resampled five times over a 7-year recovery period. In spite of a wide variety of recovery strategies to the low-intensity burn, there was little change in the floristic makeup of postburn stands compared to the preburn stand. Detrended correspondence analyses suggested that floristic composition and community structure of postburn stands shifted away from those of the preburn stand. However, this shift did not restore the populations of narrowly endemic scrub herbs. Instead, the change was toward xeric hammock, characterized by the persistence of woody understory species, the unsuccessful restoration of sand pine (Pinus clausa) as a canopy dominant, and the near absence of most herbs. These results suggest that long-unburned sand pine scrub will not return to typical scrub through the reintroduction of a single low-intensity, winter burn. This study demonstrates the necessity of monitoring the consequences of the reintroduction of fire to long-unburned vegetation associations and of recognizing variation in vegetative responses to different fire regimes.																			0885-8608					JUL	1996	16	3					171	183																WOS:A1996UZ20400002

Julio			Facilitation stabilizes moisture-controlled alpine juniper shrublines in the central Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Tibetan Plateau hosts one of the world's highest undisturbed alpine juniper shrublines. However, little is known about the dynamics of these shrublines in response to climate warming and shrub-to-shrub interactions. Since growth of shrubline junipers is limited more by moisture availability than by low temperatures, we tested if upslope advancement of alpine juniper shrublines was constrained by warmer temperatures and related recent droughts. We also evaluated whether facilitation among neighboring shrubs, as inferred from spatial analyses, influenced shrubline dynamics. Three rectangular plots crossing the Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii shrubline were sampled at elevations from 4810 to 4917 m a.s.l. near the Nam Co Lake, central Tibetan Plateau. Location of each stem and its diameter at the root collar and age were measured. We reconstructed the spatial and temporal shrubline dynamics during the past 350 years using standard dendrochronological methods. Independent, long-term summer temperature reconstructions also were associated with shrub recruitment. Point-pattern analyses were used to characterize spatial patterns of different size classes of shrubs. The three shrublines showed little long-term changes despite ongoing warming; no upward shift has occurred in the past 100 years. Recruitment was negatively associated with summer temperatures and drought occurrence since the 1920s. Spatial patterns were characterized by clustering at local scales and attraction between the different size classes, suggesting facilitation. We conclude that moisture availability limits the recruitment and elevational advance of junipers in this area of the Tibetan Plateau. Dynamics of alpine shrublines are more contingent on positive interactions and local environmental factors than on regional climatic variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Meng, HB; Zhang, J				Meng, Haobin; Zhang, Jing			Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on water quality in China during 2020 and 2022: two case surges	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The COVID-19 severely affected the world in 2020. Taking the two outbreaks in China in 2020 and 2022 as examples, the spatiotemporal changes in surface water quality levels and CODMn and NH3-N concentrations were analyzed, and the relationships between the variations in the two pollutants and environmental and social factors were evaluated. The results showed that during the two lockdowns, due to the total water consumption (including industrial, agricultural, and domestic water) decreased, the proportion of good water quality increased by 6.22% and 4.58%, and the proportion of polluted water decreased by 6.00% and 3.98%, the quality of water environment has been improved significantly. However, the proportion of excellent water quality decreased by 6.19% after entering the unlocking period. Before the second lockdown period, the average CODMn concentration exhibited a "falling, rising, and falling" trend, while the average NH3-N concentration changed in the opposite direction. The correlation analysis revealed that the increasing trend of pollutant concentrations was positively correlated with longitude and latitude, and weakly correlated with DEM and precipitation. A slight decrease trend in NH3-N concentration was negatively correlated with the population density variation and positively correlated with the temperature variation. The relationship between the change in the number of confirmed cases in provincial regions and the change in pollutant concentrations was uncertain, with positive and negative correlations. This study demonstrates the impact of lockdowns on water quality and the possibility of improving water quality through artificial regulation, which can provide a reference basis for water environmental management.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2023	30	32					79386	79401		10.1007/s11356-023-27962-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27962-7		JUN 2023						37284955					WOS:001003063900019

The lake today fills a 30x8 km big and 95 m deep tectonic basin, associated with the Kunlun Fault. The study was conducted on a sediment-core transect through the lake basin, in order to gain a complete picture of spatio-temporal environmental change. The recovered sediments are partly finely laminated and are composed of calcareous muds with variable amounts of carbonate micrite, organic matter, detrital silt and clay. On the basis of sedimentological, geochemical, and mineralogical data up to five lithological units (LU) can be distinguished that document distinct stages in the development of the lake system. The onset of the lowermost LU with lacustrine muds above basal sands indicates that lake level was at least 39 m below the present level and started to rise after 19 ka, possibly in response to regional deglaciation. At this time, the lacustrine environment was characterized by detrital sediment influx and the deposition of siliciclastic sediment. In two sediment cores, upward grain-size coarsening documents a lake-level fall after 13 cal ka BP, possibly associated with the late-glacial Younger Dryas stadial. From 11.5 to 4.3 cal ka BP, grain-size fining in sediment cores from the profundal coring sites and the onset of lacustrine deposition at a litoral core site (2 m water depth) in a recent marginal bay of Donggi Cona document lake-level rise during the early to mid-Holocene to at least modern level. In addition, high biological productivity and pronounced precipitation of carbonate micrites are consistent with warm and moist climate conditions related to an enhanced influence of summer monsoon. At 4.3 cal ka BP the lake system shifted from an aragonite- to a calcite-dominated system, indicating a change towards a fully open hydrological lake system. The younger clay-rich sediments are moreover non-laminated and lack any diagenetic sulphides, pointing to fully ventilated conditions, and the prevailing absence of lake stratification. This turning point in lake history could imply either a threshold response to insolation-forced climate cooling or a response to a non-climatic trigger, such as an erosional event or a tectonic pulse that induced a strong earthquake, which is difficult to decide from our data base.

J	Rönnback, P; Åström, M				Roennback, Pernilla; Astroem, Mats			Hydrochemical patterns of a small lake and a stream in an uplifting area proposed as a repository site for spent nuclear fuel, Forsmark, Sweden	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The overall aim of this study was to increase the understanding of the chemical dynamics of small catchments. The focus was on a small oligotropic lake and its major inflow stream in an uplifting area in eastern Sweden (Forsmark) proposed as a repository site for spent nuclear fuel. The hydrochemical sampling campaign lasted for nearly 4 years with sample collection monthly to semi-monthly, and continuous flow measurements carried out over the. last 20 months. All this was done as part of the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company's (SKBs) Site Investigation Programme. The major findings were: (1) as a result of the calcareous overburden caused by redistributed Paleozoic deposits, pH and the Ca and HCO3- concentrations were relatively high in both the stream and lake throughout the period, (2) limnic primary production resulted in decreased concentrations of, Ca, HCO3- , NH4+ NO3- and Si, and increased pH and concentrations of chlorophyll a, O-2, DON, POC, PON and POP in the lake in summer, while in other seasons (in winter in particular) when the production was minimal or non-existent the concentrations in the lake and the inflow stream were similar, (3) intrusion of brackish-water resulted in moderately to strongly increased concentrations of Cl-, Na, Mg, Br-, SO42-, K and Sr in the lake: the ratio versus Cl- were for Na and Br- always similar to those in sea water, for Mg and SO42- similar to those in sea water at elevated Cl- concentrations (> 3 mM), while K and Sr always occurred in relative excess as compared to sea water, (4) high U concentrations in both the stream :and the lake was derived most likely from reduced U-minerals in the overburden and was predicted to be carried to > 90% in the form of calcium uranyl carbonate, in a model in which colloidal Fe and Al oxyhydroxides were not considered, (5) the rare earth elements (REEs) had similar concentrations and fractionation patterns in the stream and lake, unlike those found in the overburden groundwaters, and was predicted to be carried as organic complexes, (6) in terms of the area being chosen as a site for bedrock disposal of spent nuclear fuel, of particular importance is further investigations into the sources and mechanisms of the high U concentrations in the surface waters and confirmation of the importance of the calcium uranyl carbonate complex in the surface transport of this metal, and (7) the abundance of dissolved humic acids, predicted to carry the REEs, which consist of analogues for several actinides, deserve special attention in a safety assessment perspective focusing on radionuclide contamination.

J	Mundahl, ND				Mundahl, Neal D.			Diet Diversity of Two Sculpin Species (Cottidae) in Midwestern USA Trout Streams: Patterns Across Nine Years After Severe Summer Flooding	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The geographic ranges of slimy (Uranidea cognata) and mottled (Uranidea bairdii) sculpin overlap broadly across cool and coldwater streams and rivers in North America, where they can serve very important roles in fish community dynamics. The diet diversities of slimy and mottled sculpin were examined in early March (late winter) during eight out of nine years after the August 2007 catastrophic flooding in four streams to assess potential diet shifts as benthic invertebrate prey communities recovered post-flood. In total, 10,823 prey items, representing 39 invertebrate taxa and three fish taxa were identified from the stomachs of 532 slimy sculpins (present in Garvin Brook, Gilmore Creek, and Trout Run) and 179 mottled sculpins (present in Middle Fork Whitewater River). Only four prey taxa were consumed by sculpin in all streams: midge larvae and pupae (Diptera: Chironomidae), blackfly larvae and pupae (Diptera: Simuliidae), Hydropsyche caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae), and Baetis mayfly nymphs (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae). Midges dominated diets of both slimy (61% of prey by number) and mottled (76%) sculpin across all years. Consequently, Shannon diversities of diets were typically low across all years and streams for slimy sculpin (annual site range 0.07-0.83) and across years for mottled sculpin (annual range 0.11-0.46). Diversities and taxa richness of slimy sculpin diets increased in Garvin Brook and Trout Run across the study years (driven by significant declines in midge dominance) but remained relatively unchanged for slimy sculpin in Gilmore Creek and mottled sculpin in the Middle Fork. Individual slimy and mottled sculpin differed significantly both in the numbers of taxa consumed per fish (<2 versus 2.5 taxa/fish, respectively) and in the numbers of individual prey per fish (11 versus 26 prey, respectively). Slimy sculpin in two streams displayed modest shifts in diets as benthic prey communities recovered during the 9-year period post-flood, whereas slimy and mottled sculpin in other streams displayed little to no changes in diets. Differing flood severity among streams may have produced the different responses observed in sculpin diets.

A shift in the formation of early diagenetic ferrimagnetic iron sulfides to siderites is observed around 320 ka. This change is probably associated with variable availability of sulfide in the pore water. We propose that sulfate concentrations were significantly higher before similar to 320 ka, due to either a higher sulfate flux or lower dilution of lake sulfate due to a smaller water volume. Diagenetic iron minerals appear more abundant during glacials, which are generally characterized by higher Fe/Ca ratios in the sediments. While in the lower part of the core the ferrimagnetic sulfide signal overprints the primary detrital magnetic signal, the upper part of the core is dominated by variable proportions of high-to low-coercivity iron oxides. Glacial sediments are characterized by high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals (hematite, goethite), which relate to enhanced erosion of soils that had formed during preceding interglacials. Superimposed on the glacial-interglacial behavior are millennial-scale oscillations in the magnetic mineral composition that parallel variations in summer insolation. Like the processes on glacial-interglacial timescales, low summer insolation and a retreat in vegetation resulted in enhanced erosion of soil material. Our study highlights that rock-magnetic studies, in concert with geochemical and sedimentological investigations, provide a multi-level contribution to environmental reconstructions, since the magnetic properties can mirror both environmental conditions on land and intra-lake processes.					; Lacey, Jack/AAL-3601-2020; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Just, Janna/I-1874-2015; Francke, Alexander/N-9761-2013; Sagnotti, Leonardo/AFM-3916-2022; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Sagnotti, Leonardo/0000-0003-3944-201X; Just, Janna/0000-0002-5257-604X; Francke, Alexander/0000-0002-0370-5802; Lacey, Jack H./0000-0002-6329-2149													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	7					2093	2109		10.5194/bg-13-2093-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2093-2016													WOS:000377276000008

In addition, gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum, were accidently released in October 1980, during other stocking operations by state fisheries personnel. Following the additions of these two planktivores, the duration of the calanoid season was markedly reduced, and the average standing crops for Diaptomus siciloides and Diaptomus pallidus were reduced to 50% or less than standing crops before the release of shad. Diaptomus pallidus replaced D. siciloides as the most dominant species. The establishment of a gizzard shad population in the lake has apparently kept standing crops low even through threadfin shad are no longer present.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				MAR 30	1988	33	1					41	53		10.2307/3672087	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3672087													WOS:A1988M917700006

The 2 gazelles forage mainly on plants from Leguminosae and Compositae families and domestic sheep feed mainly on Gramineae and Cyperaceae. The dietary overlap index between the 2 gazelles and Tibetan domestic sheep increased from 0.43 to 0.58 during the plant-growing period to 0.76-0.77 during the plant-withering period, which indicated competition for foods intensified during the food-limited season. Although the 2 gazelle ate similar diets, they might avoid food competition by occupying different foraging areas. We suggest reducing numbers of overwintering Tibetan domestic sheep on pastures to lessen survival pressure on the endangered gazelles during winters.

Evidence is presented that this peculiar retrogression is due to an unusual, permanent fall in the surface elevation of the lake, resulting in a separation of the lake waters from the former marginal bog mat. Physical and chem. data extending over 12 seasons are presented. Also, the biol. conditions are descr., special attention being given to the plankton. More than 115 plankters are listed, and the qualitative and quantitative peculiarities of the plankton discussed. Sponges, Turbellaria, free-living nematodes, Bryozoa, Malacostraca, Gastropoda and the Unionidae do not occur in this lake.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND QUALITY OF LAKE WATERS IN TAIGA ZONE OF TOMSK REGION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Research of the chemical composition and quality of lake waters in the taiga zone of Western Siberia within the limits of Tomsk Region is made. Research is based on the data which are received with participation of the authors in Tomsk Polytechnic and Tomsk State Universities, Open Society ''Tomskgeomonitoring'' in 2002-2012. The objects of the research are thirteen lakes located in the middle part of the boggy basin of the Vasyugan River, in the bottom part of the Tom River basin, in the watershed of the Ket and the Tym rivers and near the Ob River valley from the Tym River mouth to Strezhevoy. At the moment of inspection these lakes did not have direct anthropogenic influence (dump of sewage, engineering objects in water areas or in the water-security zone, water collection, drainage of bogs by thelake, etc.). Researches included: 1) field works on selection and preservation of tests of lake waters for further definition of their chemical composition in the accredited hydrogeochemical laboratories of Tomsk Polytechnic University, Open Society ''Tomskgeomonitoring'' and regional company "Oblcompriroda"; 2) generalization and statistical analysis of the received materials. The general eco-geochemical condition and quality of waters of lakes of boggy landscapes in the taiga zone within the limits of Tomsk Region is estimated as satisfactory (from the point of view of prevalence of natural processes of formation of chemical composition of waters) and corresponding to the minimum level of anthropogenic influence on water objects (natural condition). At the same time cases of essential excess of water quality parameters established in the Russian Federation are marked in objects for fishing purposes in.., in content of NO2-, NH4+, Fe, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn, Hg, substances identified as oil hydrocarbons; in objects for drinking purpose these are.., content of NH4+, Fe, substances identified as oil hydrocarbons, phenols under condition of water chlorination. Principle causes of the specified deviations are the surface runoff from boggy territories to the lakes and in-lake processes. Background values of physical, chemical and hydrochemical parameters of non-polluted lake waters in summer and autumn low water, including the content of sediment substances (8.64 mg/dm(3)), are established. Thus, the basis for estimation of anthropogenic changes of lake waters in the zone of activity of an oil-and-gas complex in Tomsk Region and in the adjoining territories of Hanty-Mansy region is prepared.

Juniper and Cold Springs Canyons, located on the upwind flank of the Horse Heaven Hills, are oriented perpendicular to prevailing southwesterly winds. These canyons are topographic traps that separate eolian sand on the upwind side from thick accumulations (nearly 8 m) of latest Pleistocene to Holocene L1 loess on the downwind side. Silt- and sand-rich glacial outburst flood sediment in the Umatilla Basin is the source of eolian sand and loess for the region. Sediment from this basin also contributes to loess accumulations across much of the Columbia Plateau to the northeast. Downwind of Cold Springs Canyon, Mt. St. Helens set S and Glacier Peak tephras bracket 4 m of loess, demonstrating that approximately 2500 g m(-2) yr(-1) of loess accumulated between about 15,400-13,100 cal yr B.P. Mass accumulation rates decreased to approximately 250 g m(-2) yr(-1) ; from 13,100 cal yr B. P. to the present. Tephrochronology suggests that the bulk of near-source Palouse loess accumulated in one punctuated interval in the latest Pleistocene characterized by a dry and windy climate. 2005 University of Washington.

During the Neoproterozoic, severe " snowball" glaciations would have had an extreme impact on the biosphere and the atmosphere. Here, we report that sulfate extracted from carbonate lenses within a Neoproterozoic glacial diamictite suite from Svalbard, with an age of similar to 635 million years ago, falls well outside the currently known natural range of triple oxygen isotope compositions and indicates that the atmosphere had either an exceptionally high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration or an utterly unfamiliar oxygen cycle during deposition of the diamictites.

Orbital Forcing Drives Both the South American Monsoon and Local Water Balance in the Central Andes During Interglacials	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												South American summer monsoon (SASM) strength tracks insolation on orbital timescales, linking global climate and continental hydrology. However, whether local water availability also responds to global climate forcings is unclear. Here, we present water balance records from Lake Jun & iacute;n, an Andean lake within the SASM domain. Local water balance and SASM strength is inferred from triple oxygen isotopes of lake carbonates during two interglacial periods (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 15, 621-563 ka; the Holocene, 11.7-0 ka). We find SASM strength and water balance both follow the precession-pacing of local summer insolation, with the driest conditions occurring at Lake Jun & iacute;n under weakened SASM conditions (and vice versa). Further, the largest variations occurred during MIS 15, when insolation was more variable than the Holocene. These results suggest that global climate influences South American hydrology on both the local and continental scales, with implications for tropical water resources, the atmospheric greenhouse effect, and ecosystem dynamics.					; Passey, Benjamin/F-9644-2010; Levin, Naomi/B-4124-2010	Katz, Sarah/0000-0001-6084-6858; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 12	2025	52	16							e2025GL116249	10.1029/2025GL116249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GL116249													WOS:001547582700001

Four phases were distinguished: (1) Ice-forming phase; light still penetrated the relatively thin snowpack, production was high, and a chlorophyll maximum developed close to the ice. (2) Transition towards a dark environment; light was reduced to very low levels by rapid snow accumulation, phytoplankton showed symptoms of shade adaptation, and nutrients and dissolved organic compounds changed markedly (e.g. soluble reactive phosphorus increased). (3) Central phase; for several months, loss processes (respiration, sedimentation) maintained constant rates, three zones of differing variability patterns were distinguished in the water column: an upper zone where biomass was higher and which was affected by exchange of substances with the cover during flooding processes, a middle zone with little change throughout the phase, and a deep layer, identified by catabolic activity, where diffusion of compounds from the sediment took place. (4) Thaw; sequential changes occurred near the surface owing to snowpack melting, chlorophyll reached the lowest winter values of the period in spite of light and nutrients, and nitrogen compounds changed significantly.

Direct interview with farmers, farm observation, community discussion and key informant interview (KII) had been followed over six months in Dinajpur district. It was observed that buffaloes were reared under two types of management system namely household yard intensive (HYI) and completely intensive (CI). In HYI system, farmers purchased heifer or pregnant buffalo from local market and sold mother with calf after one year. Buffaloes were kept shed at night and maintained feeding, showering and other activities in the household yard at day. Those were showered by once-two times/week in cool day, but most of them were showered in a day. On the other hand, in CI system, buffaloes were reared inside the shed all time and maintain feeding, showering and other activities in the shed. Buffaloes were showered twice in a day in winter period while three times in summer period. Average milk production for each buffalo was 5 to 8 liter/day. Major productive and reproductive traits e.g. lactation Length (day), average milk yield (L/day), dry period (day), age that of HYI system and those were found highly significant (P<0.001). Significant difference were found on total solids, fat and protein content but no significance difference were observed on SNF, lactose and ash of buffalo milk between two farms. Insignificant difference (P>0.05) was found for the value of electric conductivity (ECms/cm) that showed both farms produced healthy milk (3.25 +/- 0.49 vs 3.09 +/- 0.89). Both systems showed as a profitable venture (BCR 1.33 vs 1.25). Problem matrix revealed that the top ranked order of problem were "inadequate knowledge on buffalo rearing", "high price of feed" and "low milk price" mentioned as 1, 2 and 3. Shortage of feeds and fodder, high temperature and lack of cow boy were ranked as 4, 5 and 6. Limited breeder bull, lake of AI workers and inadequate quality semen and credit facilities mentioned as 7 ranked problem. It was concluded that ensuring training and marketing could help to improve intensive system of dairy buffalo that meet up the growing demand of milk in urban people. Simultaneously AI facilities with quality semen, HYV fodder cultivation and credit facilities should be promoted for sustainable dairy buffalo farming.																			0125-6726					JAN-MAR	2019	38	1					83	98																WOS:000462780500009

At three sites (different in depth and macrophyte colonization), trends in porewater SRP concentrations ([SRP]) in the top 5 cm of the sediment from May to August varied, possibly due to root uptake of SRP by macrophytes. At a depth of 5 m, mean (in the top 5 cm of the sediment) and variance of porewater [SRP] at one site (< 0.15 m2) were the same as over the entire lake. Excluding data from macrophyte sites, porewater [SRP] were positively related to depth of the water column (P < 0.0001). Molecular diffusion of SRP from sediments with and without macrophytes located in the trophogenic zone was calculated. During summer, molecular diffusion from shallow sediments to the trophogenic zone was 0.05 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1, or 29% of atmospheric deposition of phosphorus (P) (the major external source of P to the lake). A sampling strategy is discussed to enable the calculation of whole-lake P transport from shallow sediments to the trophogenic zone in lakes with similar morphometry and trophic status to Narrow Lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1989	46	6					981	988		10.1139/f89-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-127													WOS:A1989AA26400011

A potential tipping point in the thermal regime of a warm monomictic reservoir under climate change using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling	INLAND WATERS												The response of the Maroon reservoir in southwest Iran is modeled to evaluate possible impacts of 21st century climate change. Projections of 3 CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) were investigated using 2 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), which respectively represent low/medium and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The raw GCM projections are statistically bias-corrected to provide boundary conditions for the 3-dimensional Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D). A new overturn bias analysis method was developed to evaluate possible bias in the GCM predictors during the observational (historic) period and determined it to be negligible. The modeling results, quantified by the analysis of various limnological parameters (onset and length of mixing and stratification periods, hypolimnion and epilimnion thickness and temperature, Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and Schmidt stability) indicate for RCP4.5 a continuous reduction in winter mixing and complete suppression of mixing by the end of the 21st century, implying a switch from monomictic to weakly oligomictic behavior. Under RCP8.5, the behavior transition occurs abruptly in the late 2050s in the form of a tipping point, followed by intermittent oligomictic behavior and transition to permanent stratification (thermal meromixis) within a decade. The change in behavior occurs because the surface and mixing temperatures significantly increase due to climate warming, whereas the hypolimnion is less affected, partly because of milder warming of cold winter river inflows (underflow) and strengthening stratification. The climate change-induced tipping point for the thermal regime of Maroon reservoir might serve as an indicator of changes in other warm monomictic systems.

J	Pöysä, H				Poysa, Hannu			Tracking ice phenology by migratory waterbirds: settling phenology and breeding success of species with divergent population trends	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Dependence on climate-driven environmental cues in the initiation of life cycle stages is a critical attribute when assessing vulnerability of species to climate change impacts. This study focused on spring ice phenology as a cue to the settling of migratory waterbirds, asking whether there is an asynchrony between ice phenology and settling phenology that could affect breeding success of six species with divergent population trends. In the 37 study lakes in southeastern Finland, the ice-out date not only varied considerably between years, but became progressively earlier during the study period, 1991-2018. Settling phenology of all species tracked inter-annual variation in ice phenology. However, the degree of asynchrony between ice phenology and settling phenology varied between species, allowing discrimination between early and late settlers. Considerable inter-annual variation also occurred within species, but in only one species did the degree of asynchrony correlate with the ice-out date: for the horned grebe Podiceps auritus an earlier ice-out date meant greater asynchrony between settling phenology and ice phenology. The degree of asynchrony between settling phenology and ice phenology did not affect breeding success in any species. However, ice phenology per se affected breeding success of horned grebes: earlier ice-out was associated with lower annual breeding success. Breeding numbers of horned grebe showed a long-term decline. Results suggest that short-distance migratory birds are able to respond to climate change-driven phenological changes in their breeding environments, and that this ability may not depend on the relative timing of breeding.					; Pöysä, Hannu/JBS-4832-2023	Poysa, Hannu/0000-0002-1585-2375; 													0908-8857	1600-048X				DEC	2019	50	12							e02327	10.1111/jav.02327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.02327													WOS:000505535700008

Therefore, the water cycle on the TP and adjacent high mountain ranges, in particular the precipitation distribution and variability play an important role for the water availability for billions of people in the downstream regions of the TP. The High Asia Refined analysis (HAR) is used to analyse the dynamical factors that influence precipitation variability in the TP region, including the factors resulting in the enhancement and suppression of precipitation. Four dynamical fields that can influence precipitation are considered: the 300hPa wind speed and wind speed 2km above ground, the 300hPa vertical wind speed, and the atmospheric water transport. The study focusses on the seasonality and the spatial variability of the precipitation controls and their dominant patterns. Results show that different factors have different effects on precipitation in different regions and seasons. This depends mainly on the dominant type of precipitation, i.e. convective or frontal/cyclonic precipitation. Additionally, the study reveals that the midlatitude westerlies have a high impact on the precipitation distribution on the TP and its surroundings year-round and not only in winter.

[Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 107(2014)321-327]	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												This commentary concerns some inaccuracy in recently published paper "Arsenic mobility in the arsenic-contaminated Yangzonghai Lake in China". Yang et al. raised an incorrect conclusion that after treatment with FeCl3 using the flocculation method, the sediments in the Yangzonghai Lake released As in the summer. The fundamental flaws of the paper which led to the incorrect conclusion were unreasonable sampling method for determining As concentration at various water depth and the wrong lake water volume of 6.04 x 10(8) m(3) (actually 4.8 x 10(8) m(3)) for calculating inventory of As in Yangzhonghai in August 2012. Then the authors attribute the As release in summer to the high concentration of HCO3- without any support of experimental data. Meanwhile, the authors designed a microbiological experiment to illustrate that increasing capacity of anaerobic microorganism could lead to As releasing from sediments. In our view point, this microbiological experiment was nonsense for evaluating the stability of As in sediments of Yangzonghai lake since the experimental conditions were greatly different from the natural conditions. Therefore, we conclude that the conclusions put forward by YANG are incorrect (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have found that LSWT warming is occurring on a global scale and is expected to continue in the future. Recently, new global LSWT data products have been generated using satellite remote sensing, which provides an inimitable opportunity to study the LSWT response to global warming. Based on the satellite observations, we found that the warming rate of global lakes is uneven, with apparent regional differences. Indeed, comparing the LSWT warming in different climate zones (from arid to humid), the lakes in drylands experienced more significant warming (0.28 degrees C decade(-1)) than those in semi-humid and humid regions (0.19 degrees C decade(-1)) during previous decades (1995-2016). By further quantifying the impact factors, it showed that the LSWT warming is attributed to air temperature (74.4%), evaporation (4.1%), wind (9.9%), cloudiness (4.3%), net shortwave (3.1%), and net longwave (4.0%) over the lake surface. Air temperature is the main driving force for the warming of most global lakes, so the first estimate quantification of future LSWT trends can be determined from air temperature projections. By the end of the 21st century, the summer air temperature would warm up to 1.0 degrees C (SSP1-2.6) and 6.3 degrees C (SSP5-8.5) over lakes, with a more significant warming trend over the dryland lakes.

Dongting Lake Wetland is an important wintering habitat in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However, little is known about the effects of hydrology and climate on wintering waterbirds. Therefore, it is urgent to analyze the relationship between them. To better interpret the ecological significance, we divided the bird species into five functional groups on the basis of their typical feeding habits. Redundancy analysis (RDA) combined with forward selection procedure was applied to select the hydrological and climatic variables with significant influences. Then, response surface methodology (RSM) was carried out to identify the thresholds of the variables. The results showed that inflow and water level were probably the two critical variables accounting for 52.13% and 47.87% of the variation in the bird species, respectively. However, other variables did not reach a significant level in this study. As for the group-level, different functional bird groups had different reflections to inflow and water level. Minimal guaranteed values of the two variables were identified as 3518.82-3736.28 m(3)/s and 22.61-23.49m respectively based on the hydrological requirements and the weights of all groups. The results highlighted that the minimal requirements of inflow and water level should be satisfied to provide appropriate habitats for waterbirds. Besides, the regulatory authorities and environmental protection agencies should develop relevant law or regulation to protect waterbird habitats from human destruction especially the activities which could change the hydrological regime.

However, the potential of palaeoclimate data for understanding mechanisms triggering climate extremes over long time scales has not been fully exploited. A distinction between proxies indicating climate change, environment, and ecosystem shift is crucial for enabling a comparison with forcing mechanisms (e.g. El-Nino Southern Oscillation). In this study we decouple these factors using data analysis techniques [multiplex recurrence network (MRN) and principal component analyses (PCA)] on multiproxy data from two lakes located in different climate regions - Lonar Lake (ISM dominated) and the high-altitude Tso Moriri Lake (ISM and westerlies influenced). Our results indicate that (i) MRN analysis, an indicator of changing environmental conditions, is associated with droughts in regions with a single climate driver but provides ambiguous results in regions with multiple climate/environmental drivers; (ii) the lacustrine ecosystem was 'less sensitive' to forcings during the early Holocene wetter periods; (iii) archives in climate zones with a single climate driver were most sensitive to regime shifts; (iv) data analyses are successful in identifying the timing of onset of climate change, and distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic (lacustrine) regime shifts by comparison with forcing mechanisms. Our results enable development of conceptual models to explain links between forcings and regional climate change that can be tested in climate models to provide an improved understanding of the ISM dynamics and their impact on ecosystems.

Ecosystem anthropogenic enrichments enhance Chroococcus abundance and suppress Anabaena during cyanobacterial-dominated spring blooms in the Pengxi River, Three Gorges Reservoir, China	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Taxa-specific responses to the increasing anthropogenic eutrophication offer promising insights for mitigating harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwaters. The present study evaluated the HABs species dynamics in response to the ecosystem anthropogenic enrichment during cyanobacterial-dominated spring HABs in the Pengxi River, Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Results show significant cyanobacterial dominance with a relative abundance (RA = 76.54 %). The ecosystem enrichments triggered shifts in the HABs community structure from Anabaena to Chroococcus, especially in the culture involving iron (Fe) addition (RA = 66.16 %). While P-alone enrichment caused a dramatic increase in the aggregate cell density (2.45 x 108 cells L-1), the multiple enrichment (NPFe) led to maximum biomass production (as chl-a = 39.62 & PLUSMN; 2.33 & mu;gL-1), indicating that nutrient in conjunction with the HABs taxonomic characteristics e.g., tendency to possess high cell pigment contents rather than cell density can potentially determine massive biomass accumulations during HABs. The stimulation of growth as biomass production demonstrated by both P-alone and the multiple enrichments, NPFe indicates that although P exclusive control is feasible in the Pengxi ecosystem, it can only guarantee a short-term reduction in HABs magnitude and duration, thus a lasting HABs mitigation measure must consider a policy recommendation involving multiple nutrient management, especially N and P dual control strategy. The present study would adequately complement the concerted effort in developing a rational predictive framework for freshwater eutrophication management and HABs mitigations in the TGR and elsewhere with similar anthropogenic stressors.

However, the extent to which this affected the status of lakes in North China is unclear. In the study, we analyzed multiple proxies (delta C-13, magnetic susceptibility [chi(lf)], and exogenous element concentrations) from Lake Mayinghai, an undisturbed alpine lake in North China. We also compared the results with previously published paleoenvironmental records from the Chinese Loess Plateau. We aimed to determine the extent of the influence of variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) on the status of Lake Mayinghai during the late Holocene. The results demonstrate that negative delta C-13 values at Lake Mayinghai correspond to high sedimentary tree pollen content and high reconstructed precipitation, indicating that variations in delta C-13 likely reflect variations in vegetation and the EASM in North China. A comparison of the delta C-13 record with other proxies from the same core reveals an abrupt change in the EASM at similar to 3 kyr before present (BP), which is also evident in other regional climate records from the Chinese Loess Plateau. The rapid decline in EASM intensity at similar to 3 kyr BP is also consistent with changes in the status of Lake Mayinghai, Lake Gonghai, Lake Ganhai, and Lake Daihai, in that these lakes underwent an abrupt retreat after 3 kyr BP, demonstrating that the rapid decline in EASM intensity at similar to 3 kyr BP had a large impact on lake evolution in North China.

Development of an aquatic pathogen database (AquaPathogen X) and its utilization in tracking emerging fish virus pathogens in North America	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												The AquaPathogen X database is a template for recording information on individual isolates of aquatic pathogens and is freely available for down-load (http://wfrc.usgs.gov). This database can accommodate the nucleotide sequence data generated in molecular epidemiological studies along with the myriad of abiotic and biotic traits associated with isolates of various pathogens (e. g. viruses, parasites and bacteria) from multiple aquatic animal host species (e. g. fish, shellfish and shrimp). The cataloguing of isolates from different aquatic pathogens simultaneously is a unique feature to the AquaPathogen X database, which can be used in surveillance of emerging aquatic animal diseases and elucidation of key risk factors associated with pathogen incursions into new water systems. An application of the template database that stores the epidemiological profiles of fish virus isolates, called Fish ViroTrak, was also developed. Exported records for two aquatic rhabdovirus species emerging in North America were used in the implementation of two separate web-accessible databases: the Molecular Epidemiology of Aquatic Pathogens infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (MEAP-IHNV) database (http://gis.nacse.org/ihnv/) released in 2006 and the MEAP-viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (http://gis.nacse.org/vhsv/) database released in 2010.

Prevailing westerly winds during July caused upwelling of cold water in Western Lake Ontario. A two-layer exchange flow through the canal was driven by the resulting density difference between Lake Ontario and Hamilton Harbour. In the canal, a lower layer of cold lake water flowed into the harbour while an upper layer of warm harbour water flowed out into Lake Ontario. The intrusion of fresh, cool, oxygenated Lake Ontario water had a dramatic impact on the hypolimnion of Hamilton Harbour. When the prevailing winds shifted to the east in early August downwelling in Western Lake Ontario resulted in a reduced exchange flux that included an episode of 'reverse' exchange with an upper layer of warmer lake water flowing into the harbour. The volume of the exchange during July 8-28 was estimated to be 23% of the harbour volume, with daily mean exchange fluxes of 25-50 m(3)/s. During sustained upwelling, July 16-28, the exchange was 54% less than predicted by inviscid two-layer hydraulics. Frictional effects accounted for 45% of this reduction, while recirculation due to interfacial mixing accounted for the remaining 9%. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

There are outcrops of geological materials from Palaeozoic to Quaternary times. These materials have been classified into eight hydrostratigraphic units. The Jurassic 'carniolas' and limestones in the Iberian Chain (HU 4 and 5) are the materials which have the best hydraulic properties for underground water catchment and for forming the regional aquifer. The Triassic gypsum and marl of HU 3 form the impermeable substratum of the overlying Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonated aquifers, and they are therefore the impermeable base of the aquifers being studied. The equipotential line map of the regional aquifer shows the pattern of the groundwater flowing to specific points which mark the springs producing the underground drainage of the Iberian Chain. The volume of water throughout the aquifer is currently evaluated at approximately 250 hm(3)/year, which discharge through springs with high flowrates, or through diffuse discharges in the riverbeds and in wetlands (saline lakes). The water discharged in these springs has a high mineralisation, with a dry residue of over 1000 mg/l. Calcium sulphate compositions dominate, originating in the presence of soluble anhydrous materials within the Lias and Keuper formations. The current sedimentation in relation to the groundwater flows from the Iberian Chain can only be found in the areas of diffuse discharge where the evaporitic sedimentation can be observed because of the frequently endorheic character. On the right bank of the Ebro River more than 60 depressions are known, where very mineralised lakes form. These are locally referred to as 'saladas'. During the Miocene, the hydrogeological functioning would be similar to the present one, leaving the groundwater and the dissolved salts in a non-marine basin. They would therefore accumulate in large areas of diffuse discharge, creating lakes where the evaporites would precipitate. The deep regional groundwater flows would ascend to the surface from the overthrust lamina fronts, going through thick Tertiary alluvial deposits in the Ebro Basin, and therefore the discharges were mainly diffuse.

Assessing changes in the hydrology and water resources in inland basins under a warm climate in the recent geological past can provide a valuable context for assessing their current and possible future status. Here we present a record from a rapidly-accumulating sediment core from Lake Dalianhai in the Gonghe Basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The chronology of the uppermost 51.63 m of the core is based on AMS C-14 dates from 11 samples of terrestrial plant microfossils and 14 bulk samples. Hydroclimatic variations within the basin during the last 23,000 yr were reconstructed from sedimentological and geochemical parameters and paleoshoreline records. The results indicate that the Gonghe Basin experienced relatively arid conditions during 23,000-14,700 cal yr BP. Lake Dalianhai was refilled at 14,700 cal yr BP and a high lake level was sustained until the beginning of the Holocene, as indicated by changes in the concentration of OH-GDGTs. However, the lake level was low during the early to middle Holocene (11,700-4700 cal yr BP) and increased during the late Holocene. Based on a comparison with lake level records and aeolian sand deposits from the region, we conclude that the climate was extremely dry in basins in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the early to middle Holocene. We propose that strong evaporation combined with high summer temperatures during the early to middle Holocene were responsible for the dry climate at that time, rather than changes in mid-latitude precipitation. Given the situation occurred during the early to middle Holocene, ongoing global warming may seriously threaten water resources in inland China, even if precipitation increases substantially.

A six weeks run is performed under late autumn conditions, in which the particle load of rivers entering the lake is high. Meteorological wind data and realistic thermal stratification are included in the model. At the Areuse river output, particles are injected into the lake. In addition to their advection by the currents, the particles possess a vertical settling velocity. The simulation indicates that privileged deposition areas for suspended particulate matter which is discharged by the Areuse river, are confined to the north-east region of the lake.																			0012-9402						1994	87	2					385	402																WOS:A1994PF75700008

Northern wetlands ( > 45 degrees N), accounting for 42 % of global wetland area, are increasingly vulnerable to carbon loss, especially as CH4 emissions may accelerate under intensified high-latitude warming. However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of high-latitude CH4 emissions remain relatively uncertain. Here, we present estimates of daily CH4 fluxes obtained using a new machine learning-based wetland CH4 upscaling framework (WetCH(4)) that combines the most complete database of eddy-covariance (EC) observations available to date with satellite remote-sensing-informed observations of environmental conditions at 10 km resolution. The most important predictor variables included near-surface soil temperatures (top 40 cm), vegetation spectral reflectance, and soil moisture. Our results, modeled from 138 site years across 26 sites, had relatively strong predictive skill, with a mean R 2 of 0.51 and 0.70 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 30 and 27 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for daily and monthly fluxes, respectively. Based on the model results, we estimated an annual average of 22.8 +/- 2.4 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for the northern wetland region (2016-2022), and total budgets ranged from 15.7 to 51.6 Tg CH4 yr(-1), depending on wetland map extents. Although 88 % of the estimated CH4 budget occurred during the May-October period, a considerable amount ( 2.6 +/- 0.3 Tg CH4) occurred during winter. Regionally, the Western Siberian wetlands accounted for a majority (51 %) of the interannual variation in domain CH4 emissions. Overall, our results provide valuable new high-spatiotemporal-resolution information on the wetland emissions in the high-latitude carbon cycle. However, many key uncertainties remain, including those driven by wetland extent maps and soil moisture products and the incomplete spatial and temporal representativeness in the existing CH4 flux database; e.g., only 23 % of the sites operate outside of summer months, and flux towers do not exist or are greatly limited in many wetland regions. These uncertainties will need to be addressed by the science community to remove the bottlenecks currently limiting progress in CH4 detection and monitoring. The dataset can be found at 10.5281/zenodo.10802153 (Ying et al., 2024).

Two operational scenarios were analysed: the hydropeaking of the hydropower plant and a fictional scenario without hydropeaking. Two time periods were considered to allow different seasonal and operating conditions to be considered. The location of the thermocline was determined by the depth of the outlet and the withdrawal rate. Spectral analysis showed a strong correlation between the water withdrawals and the internal waves in the reservoir. Furthermore, vertical mixing with hydropeaking during the summer can be enhanced by one order of magnitude with respect to the case without hydropeaking. We conclude that hydropeaking has a major impact on the hydrodynamics of the reservoir, which indicates that diurnal variations in the outflows should be considered when studying these systems.					de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/G-7018-2016	de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/0000-0001-5415-9816													0022-1686	1814-2079				NOV 2	2015	53	6					760	772		10.1080/00221686.2015.1060271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00221686.2015.1060271													WOS:000367068600006

The fish fed opportunistically. Differences between seasons reflected changes in prey availability. During the intensive feeding and growing period fish fed on cladocerans. Daphnia spp. and Bythotrephes were the most numerous and frequent organisms in the diet. During winter, chironomid nymphs represented a major part of the gut contents. The most abundant crustaceans, cyclopoids, did not occur frequently in the diet, although they pass on to the fish the cestode parasite, Proteocephallus longicollis, whose prevalence is very high. The diet of arctic charr sometimes overlapped that of the whitefish. Other fish species also preyed extensively on chironomids - the principal food resource for fish in the lake.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						199	207																WOS:000180355400017

An overview of distal tephrochronology in northern Europe during the last 1000 years	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Several tephra layers from the last millennium have been identified in distal peat and lake sediment sequences in northern Europe, forming a framework of volcanic events of great value for palaeoenvironmental investigations. Most of the tephras within this framework have an origin in Iceland, but distal layers from Jan Mayen have also been identified. The predominant transport pathway, in an easterly-southeasterly direction, has led to the deposition of these tephras in a number of terrestrial deposits in northern Europe. Ash from silicic eruptions (>63% SiO2) dominate at these sites, even though many of the documentary records in distal areas report tephra fall from several basaltic eruptions. Here we provide an overview of the distribution, shard concentration and geochemistry of these tephras to highlight the most important isochrones for addressing key dating issues. In particular, three horizons - Hekla-1 (AD 1104), Oraefajokull (AD 1362) and Askja (AD 1875) - are found at a number of different locations in northern Europe and as such are valuable tie-points for improving and validating chronological models and for synchronisation of records spanning the last 1000 years. In addition, we present new data identifying tephra from the Grimsvotn volcanic system within the Lomonosovfonna ice cap on Svalbard, demonstrating that some tephras have been transported 2000 km to as far north as 79 degrees N along a northeasterly trajectory. This discovery highlights the potential for Utilising tephrochronology as a correlation tool for palaeoarchives located in more northerly areas and the complex nature of fall-out from different eruptions.

J	Arzel, C; Elmberg, J				Arzel, C; Elmberg, J			Time use, foraging behavior and microhabitat use in a temporary guild of spring-staging dabbling ducks (Anas spp.)	ORNIS FENNICA												Dabbling ducks were studied on a eutrophic mid-flyway staging site in spring. Six species made up a temporary guild, in order of decreasing abundance they were: Teal (Anas crecca), Shoveler (A. clypeata), Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), Wigeon (A. penelope), Pintail (A. acuta), and Garganey (A. querquedula). Species richness and total abundance peaked around 20 April, whereas guild evenness was highest after the staging peak. Time use during the staging peak differed between the sexes in Mallard, but not in the other species. Mallard spent the least time foraging, whereas Shoveler and Teal foraged the most. Foraging behavior differed among species; i.e. Wigeon was mainly on land, Shoveler mainly fed from the water surface, whilst Mallard and Teal were more generalist. For the guild as a whole, shallow inshore areas were overused compared to offshore habitats. Microhabitat use of foraging birds differed among species; Pintail and Shoveler mainly fed in the offshore end of the habitat gradient, whereas Teal, Garganey, female Mallard, and especially Wigeon used shallow microhabitats. Teal and female Mallard had the highest overlap in microhabitat use, Shoveler and Wigeon had the least. Abundance of invertebrate prey was low during the staging peak, but increased sharply thereafter. This study indicates that eutrophic mid-flyway sites may offer less food to staging birds than do breeding lakes to which many of them are headed.

This region is well known for its highly developed karst and the presence of all types of karstic features. In addition to the high degree of karstification, the advantage of Skadar Lake's catchment area in terms of water resources is also reflected in the following factors: a large amount of precipitation, scarcity of soil and vegetation cover, favourable geological and geomorphological conditions for karst aquifer discharge, the isolation of the Skadar basin from the influence of the Adriatic Sea and an availability of water for simple abstraction. For the purposes of a more complete determination of the water balance of Skadar Lake, among other undertakings, it has been necessary to determine the groundwater inflow to the lake through numerous sublacustrine springs (vruljas). By using thermal infrared satellite and terrestrial imaging, the locations of the largest sublacustrine springs have been detected and their yield assessed by means of water balance calculation after the application of the KARSTLOP method. The mean annual groundwater inflow to the lake, from the south-western edge only, is 9.86 m(3)/s. The total outflow of water from the lake through the Bojana River is around 304 m(3)/s. The coincidence of several important natural factors leads to the large average specific yield (surface and subsurface) in the Skadar Lake catchment area (54 l/s/km(2)), which makes this region one of the richest areas of freshwater in the world.

J	Poulson, SR; Sullivan, AB				Poulson, Simon R.; Sullivan, Annett B.			Assessment of diel chemical and isotopic techniques to investigate biogeochemical cycles in the upper Klamath River, Oregon, USA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The upper Klamath River experiences a cyanobacterial algal bloom and poor water quality during the summer. Diel chemical and isotopic techniques have been employed in order to investigate the rates of biogeochemical processes. Four diel measurements of field parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and alkalinity) and stable isotope compositions (dissolved oxygen-delta O-18 and dissolved inorganic carbon-delta C-13) have been performed between June 2007 and August 2008. Significant diel variations of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and DO-delta O-18 were observed, due to varying rates of primary productivity vs. respiration vs. gas exchange with air. Diel cycles are generally similar to those previously observed in river systems, although there are also differences compared to previous studies. In large part, these different diel signatures are the result of the low turbulence of the upper Klamath River. Observed changes in the diel signatures vs. sampling date reflect the evolution of the status of the algal bloom over the course of the summer. Results indicate the potential utility of applying diel chemical and stable isotope techniques to investigate the rates of biogeochemical cycles in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, but also illustrate the increased complexity of stable isotope dynamics in these low-turbulence systems compared to well-mixed aquatic systems.

Water and sediment quality, nutrient biochemistry and pollution loads in an urban freshwater lake: balancing human and ecological services	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Optimizing the utility of constructed waterways as residential development with water-frontage, along with a productive and functional habitat for wildlife is of considerable interest to managers. This study examines Lake Hugh Muntz, a large (17 ha) freshwater lake built in Gold Coast City, Australia. A ten year water quality monitoring programme shows that the lake has increasing nutrient concentrations, and together with summer algal blooms, the lake amenity as a popular recreational swimming and triathlon training location is at risk. A survey of fish and aquatic plant communities showed that the lake supports a subset of species found in adjacent natural wetlands. Sediment contaminants were below the lower Australian trigger values, except As, Hg, Pb and Zn, probably a function of untreated and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from nearby urban roads. Sediment biogeochemistry showed early signs of oxygen depletion, and an increase in benthic organic matter decomposition and oxygen consumption will result in more nitrogen recycled to the water column as NH4+ (increasing the intensity of summer algal blooms) and less nitrogen lost to the atmosphere as N-2 gas via denitrification. A series of catchment restoration initiatives were modeled and the optimal stormwater runoff restoration effort needed for lake protection will be costly, particularly retrospective, as is the case here. Overall, balancing the lifestyles and livelihoods of residents along with ecosystem protection are possible, but require considerable trade-offs between ecosystem services and human use.

AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW												Purpose Satellite-based weather index insurance has recently been considered in order to reduce the high basis risk of station-based weather index insurance. However, the use of satellite data with a relatively low spatial resolution has not yet made it possible to determine the satellite indices free of disturbing landscape elements such as mountains, forests and lakes. Design/methodology/approach In this context, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used based on both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (250 x 250 m) and high-resolution Landsat 5/8 (30 x 30 m) images to investigate the effect of a higher spatial resolution of satellite-based weather index contracts for hedging winter wheat yields. For three farms in north-east Germany, insurance contracts both at field and farm level were designed. Findings The results indicate that with an increasing spatial resolution of satellite data, the basis risk of satellite-based weather index insurance contracts can be reduced. However, the results also show that the design of NDVI-based insurance contracts at farm level also reduces the basis risk compared to field level. The study shows that higher-resolution satellite data are advantageous, whereas satellite indices at field level do not reduce the basis risk. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, the effect of increasing spatial resolution of satellite images for satellite-based weather index insurance is investigated for the first time at the field level compared to the farm level.					; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021	Musshoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; 													0002-1466	2041-6326				JUL 7	2022	82	4					616	640		10.1108/AFR-12-2020-0177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AFR-12-2020-0177		AUG 2021											WOS:000685025600001

Controlling soluble iron and manganese in a water-supply reservoir using hypolimnetic oxygenation	WATER RESEARCH												Soluble metals such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) often reach problematic levels in water-supply reservoirs during summer stratification following the onset of hypolimnetic hypoxia. The behavior of soluble and particulate Fe and Mn was studied following the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenation system in Carvins Cove Reservoir, a water-supply impoundment managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority. During oxygenation, manganese concentrations were very low in the bulk hypolimnion (<0.05mgl(-1)), but high concentrations (>2.0mgl(-1)) were still observed in the benthic region close to the sediment, despite near-sediment dissolved oxygen concentrations in excess of 5.0 mgl(-1). Oxygenation appears to affect the location of the oxic/anoxic boundary sufficiently to restrict substantial transport of soluble Mn to the bulk water of the hypolimnion. However, the position of the oxic/anoxic boundary was not uniformly affected along the reservoir bottom, allowing horizontal transport of soluble Mn from higher elevations in contact with hypoxic sediments. During one summer, when the oxygen system was turned off for a month, the soluble Mn in the bulk hypolimnion increased substantially. oxygen concentrations were quickly restored after the system was turned back on, but elevated levels of soluble Mn persisted until the sedimentation rate of detritus through the hypolimnion increased. When operated without interruption, the oxygenation system was able to reduce the bulk average hypolimnion soluble Mn concentration by up to 97%, indicating that source water control of soluble Mn and Fe can be accomplished with hypolimnetic oxygenation in water-supply reservoirs.

Magnitudes and controls of organic and inorganic carbon flux through a chain of hard-water lakes on the northern Great Plains	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Whole-lake carbon (C) mass-balance budgets were constructed for a chain of six hard-water lakes to quantify the relative importance of organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) exchanges between atmosphere, water column, sediments, and rivers. Mean summer C fluxes were calculated for each lake during the ice-free periods (May to September) of 1995-2007 by measuring deposition of IC and OC in lake sediments, export of C to outflow rivers, lotic C influxes, and atmospheric exchange of CO2. Unlike soft-water lakes, IC in rivers accounted for 68.2-85.6% of total C (TC) influx to these hard-water lakes, CO2 efflux accounted for 0-44.5% of total C export (median 2.8%), and sedimentation buried similar amounts of OC and IC. Deposition of C in sediments accounted for 1.8-61.7% of total export and was correlated to water residence time, while C efflux through rivers accounted for 32.6-98.2% of total export, mainly as IC (69.6-85.1% of TC). Unexpectedly, estimates of net ecosystem production based on OC mass balances suggested that all lakes were autotrophic (production > respiration) during summer, despite elevated dissolved organic carbon content (5.6-16.1 mg C L-1), pCO(2) values, and net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from three lakes. We conclude that C fluxes within and among these hard-water lakes are regulated by hydrologic inputs of dissolved IC rather than by lake metabolism, IC and OC pathways are only loosely coupled, and future climate variability will alter C fluxes in similar lakes mainly through regulation of mass transfer from land.

Controls on phytoplankton physiology in Lake Ontario during the late summer: evidence from new fluorescence methods	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fast repetition rate fluorescence (FRRF) and spectral fluorescence, together with measures of nutrients and pigments, were used to characterize the composition and photosynthetic physiology of Lake Ontario phytoplankton in late summer and relate them to environmental conditions. Two stations demonstrated effects from relatively heavy anthropogenic disturbance and showed that the response of phytoplankton physiology to different impacts is highly variable. Other stations were more similar in phytoplankton composition, and in situ fluorescence yields (F-q'/F-m') in the lower surface mixed layer suggested good physiological condition (0.45-0.50). Nutrient ratios and mean irradiance indicated a general state of light saturation and slight phosphorus (P) deficiency, but physiological variations among stations were unrelated to measures of P deficiency. Fluorescence yields often decreased when surface layer samples were held in the dark, consistent with an induction of chlororespiration and prior exposure to supersaturating levels of irradiance. Comparative estimates of photosynthesis by FRRF and C-14 revealed disparities suggestive of substantial differences between in situ and incubation methods, while spectral fluorescence appeared to underestimate cyanobacterial abundance. FRRF parameters, particularly F-q'/F-m' were effective in identifying higher-impact stations and showed promise as an efficient means of characterizing variations in phytoplankton condition that may underlie phenomena such as taste and odour production.

Monthly mean water discharge records of the Harricana River, and monthly mean temperature and total precipitation series collected at the Iroquois Falls weather station, all over the 1915-1990 period, were analyzed similarly. About 3.5-, 3.75-, and 7.5-year periodicities were detected in all the dendrochronological series; the 3.75- and 7.5-year components are harmonics of a 15-year periodicity that a majority of the series presented. All the ring-width chronologies, with the exceptions of the high elevation class and the stand near a bog, showed a strong biennial periodic component. A predominant 6.25-year periodicity was detected in the water discharge of the Harricana River and, to a lesser extent, in the ring-width chronologies of mid and high elevations. After an about 11-year periodicity was detected in several tree-ring and climatic series, peaks in the corresponding sine waves fitted to the tree-ring series were found to correspond to maxima in sunspot activity. Effects of geomorphological landform and elevation from the lake on the fluctuations from year to year of the radial growth of black ash were assessed by a two-way analysis of variance of the finite Fourier transform of ring-width chronologies from 46 sites, using landform and elevation as factors and sites as replicates. Significant landform effects were observed at short to longer periodicities, while an elevation environmental gradient was finely delimited. The low to high concordance levels observed in the periodicities of tree-ring series from different stands were related to ecological factors.																			0929-1016	1744-4179				FEB	1998	29	1					1	29		10.1076/brhm.29.1.1.3040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1076/brhm.29.1.1.3040													WOS:000072251600001
J	WOBESER, G; RAINNIE, DJ				WOBESER, G; RAINNIE, DJ			EPIZOOTIC NECROTIC ENTERITIS IN WILD GEESE	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Outbreaks of a disease characterized by severe necrotic enteritis occurred among Canada geese (Branta canadensis), lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), Ross geese (A. rossi), and white-fronted geese (A. albifrons) on lakes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba during the autumn of 1983, 1984 and 1985. Ducks using the lakes were apparently not affected. Lesions in the geese closely resembled those described in enteritides in other species associated with the proliferation of Clostridium perfringens in the small intestine. Clostridium perfringens was present in large numbers in the affected areas of the intestine of the geese; other pathogens were not identified. It is hypothesized that an abrupt change in diet as geese begin to feed on grain disrupts the intestinal microflora, allowing C. perfringens to proliferate in the upper small intestine. Toxins produced by the bacteria then cause mucosal necrosis. Protease-inhibitory substances in some grains might also have a role in the disease.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				JUL	1987	23	3					376	385		10.7589/0090-3558-23.3.376	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-23.3.376								3625893					WOS:A1987J341500004

This study focused on the investigation of the Triassic Chang 7(3) member deep lacustrine sandstone. Eleven lithofacies are identified and classified into three different types of deposits: ash fall and intra- and extra-basinal turbidite deposits. Vitric tuff, pumice-bearing shale, and ash are the main ash fall lithofacies. The presence of reverse grading and a significant concentration of plant fragments/micas suggest extra-basinal turbidite deposits. However, the collapse of deltaic intrabasinal sediments has been well sorted and does not contain plant debris and low-density materials. These three different types of sediments combined with a humid climate are the main causes for the deposition of a large number of sandstone layers in the deep lacustrine environment. Furthermore, the abundant volcanic eruptions are associated with increased organic matter accumulation and promoted the bloom of algae. In addition, the generated oil in the black shales would then migrate and accumulate in the interbedded sandstones. This research provides geological evidence for the prospective prediction of lacustrine shale oil accumulations.

The concentrations of the selected antibiotics in the surface water, eight major inflowing rivers and sewage treatment plant (STP) samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. The results indicated that sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin were the predominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 95.6 and 383.4 ng L-1, respectively, in the river samples. In Lake Chaohu, the western inflowing rivers (the Nanfei and Shiwuli Rivers) were the primary import routes for the antibiotics, and the domestic effluent from four STPs were considered the primary source of the antibiotics. The level of antibiotics in Lake Chaohu clearly varied with seasonal changes, and the highest detectable frequencies and mean concentrations were found during the winter. The quality of water downstream of Lake Chaohu was influenced by the lake, and the results of risk assessment of the antibiotics on aquatic organisms suggested that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in the surface water of Lake Chaohu and inflowing rivers might pose a high risk to algae and plants.

However, lake systems worldwide are extremely fragile, and many are shrinking due to changing climate and anthropogenic activities. Here, we show that Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has experienced a dramatic and prolonged recession, which began in late September of 2003. We further demonstrate that abnormally low levels appear during October, 28 days ahead of the normal initiation of the dry season, which greatly imperiled the lake's wetland areas and function as an ecosystem for wintering waterbirds. An increase in the river-lake water level gradient induced by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) altered the lake balance by inducing greater discharge into the Changjiang River, which is probably responsible for the current lake shrinkage. Occasional episodes of arid climate, as well as local sand mining, will aggravate the lake recession crisis. Although impacts of TGD on the Poyang Lake recession can be overruled by episodic extreme droughts, we argue that the average contributions of precipitation variation, human activities in the Poyang Lake catchment and TGD regulation to the Poyang Lake recession can be quantified as 39.1%, 4.6% and 56.3%, respectively.

In this study, we present high-resolution geochemical and grain-size records of marine sediments from the coastal shelf of the northern South China Sea to investigate regional hydrological variations. Results suggest a warm and humid climate during the interval 9 200-7 600 cal a BP, followed by a cold and dry climate from 7 600 cal a BP to 6 500 cal a BP, and progressive humidification during the period 6 500-6 200 cal a BP. A prominent hydrological anomaly occurred during 7 600-6 500 cal a BP. This abrupt event corresponds closely to tropical Pacific and interhemispheric temperature gradients, suggesting that moisture variations in southern China may have been driven by interhemispheric and zonal Pacific temperature gradients via modulation of the intensity and location of the West Pacific subtropical high.

J	Bourquin, S; Rigollet, C; Bourges, P				Bourquin, S; Rigollet, C; Bourges, P			High-resolution sequence stratigraphy of an alluvial fan-fan delta environment: stratigraphic and geodynamic implications - An example from the Keuper Chaunoy sandstones, Paris basin	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Facies analysis of the Chaunoy Formation, conducted as the first stage of this study, reveals that the corresponding fluvial system essentially involved bedload deposition, 2-D and 3-D megaripple migration, and debris-how deposition. Such processes are characteristic of alluvial fan depositional environments. These alluvial fan deposits pass laterally eastward into a shallow lacustrine environment. In stage 2 of the study, electrofacies are defined by well-log analysis and then matched with sedimentary facies defined by core analysis. Electrofacies associations and depositional environments are then inferred directly from well-logs on this basis. Six electrofacies characterizing the main sedimentary facies associations and depositional environments within the Chaunoy Formation are defined (channel, lag deposits, channel infilling, lake or hood-plain, overflow deposits and pareosols). Stage 3 involves establishing correlations based on high-resolution sequence stratigraphy. Within these continental deposits, the procedure consists in analysing high-frequency fluctuations in baselevel defined from sedimentological studies and calibrated on well-log signatures. The correlations show that the top of the Chaunoy Formation is diachronous. The formation is subdivided here into three stratigraphic units from base to top: Chaunoy I, II and III. This study shows that the degree of preservation of continental deposits varies with stratigraphic cycle: genetic sequences and genetic sequence sets are asymmetrical, with the baselevel rise being better preserved than the baselevel fall, while, for minor cycle, deposits may be similarly preserved during baselevel rise and fall. The sequence stratigraphy pattern of the genetic sequences and the genetic sequence sets can result from climatic and/or tectonic factors but their effects are difficult to distinguish. At the scale of the minor Chaunoy I cycle or the Chaunoy II cycle, preservation is similar during the baselevel rise and fall, that implies that the Chaunoy minor cycles were influenced by load discharge resulting in greater accommodation space which could result from climatic or tectonic fluctuations. The Chaunoy Formation was deposited as part of a major baselevel rise during the Carnian-Liassic cycle. During this cycle, the Paris basin was generally tilted to the northwest producing the intra-'Marnes irisees superieures' truncation which seems to have been induced by large-scale wavelength tectonic deformation. Detailed isopach maps of minor baselevel cycles in Chaunoy I with inferred depositional environments are used to define the extent of depositional environments and fault activity during baselevel rise and fall. During emplacement of the braided alluvial fan and lacustrine deposits of the Chaunoy Formation, fault activity, which was confined to the western part of the basin, controlled the preservation potential, i.e. the thickness of the deposits, and depositional environment profiles. Within the Chaunoy I and II cycles, the increased thickness of the sandstone deposits to the northeast and the onlap at the top of Chaunoy I can be explained by local fault activity and by the general tilting of the basin. The Chaunoy III sandstones are confined to the western part of the basin and seem to have been controlled by local factors only. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Dugesia dorotocephala occurred at 13 sites, with most of these in the Valley and Ridge province and none in the East Gulf Coastal Plain. Cura foremanii was at 10 sites, with most of these in the Valley and Ridge and none in the Highland Rim. Phagocata morgani morgani was collected at eight sites, and although not found in the Highland Rim and Piedmont Plateau, its occurrence in the East Gulf Coastal Plain extends its known range in the southeastern United States. Phagocata gracilis was at four sites, all associated with springs in the Highland Rim. The Cumberland Plateau had the fewest sites with planarians, and the East Gulf Coastal Plain had the most sites, 13 with D. tigrina.

Distribution patterns of phytoplankton species were ordinated statistically by principal components analysis (PCA). The first component was strongly related to trophic gradient and it particularly discriminated the eutrophic and hypertrophic reservoirs. The second component segregated life-forms, so that (1), on the oligo-mesotrophic side, large dinoflagellates were separated from small centric diatoms, unicellular chrysophytes and filamentous ullotrichales and, on the eu-hypertrophic side (2), colonial greens and large desmids were separated from unicellular volvocales and small centric diatoms. The large differences between eutrophic and hypertrophic reservoirs were also clearly identified in a second PCA, in which physical and chemical factors were used with the principal components solved from the phytoplankton data. From these results, a new trophic category was discerned, for which we propose the name 'holotrophic'. This category applies to water bodies having the following main features: (1) concentrations of chorophyll, total P and total N in the range of the hypertrophic systems, but with much higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus and ammonia and (2) phytoplankton predominantly composed by unicellular green flagellates (Pteromonas, Chlamydomonas) and chlorococcales (Scenedesmus), without cyanobacterial blooms.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The potential exploitation of areas becoming ice-free in response to ongoing climate change has rarely been addressed, although it could be of interest from the water management perspective. Here we present an estimate for the potential of mitigating projected changes in seasonal water availability from melting glaciers by managing runoff through reservoirs. For the European Alps we estimate that by the end of the century, such a strategy could offset up to 65% of the expected summer-runoff changes from presently glacierized surfaces. A first-order approach suggests that the retention volume potentially available in the areas becoming deglacierized is in excess of the volume required for achieving the maximal possible mitigation by more than one order of magnitude. Obviously, however, such a strategy cannot compensate for the reduction in annual runoff caused by glacier ice depletion. Our estimates indicate that by 2070-2099, 0.73. +/- 0.67 km(3) a(-1) of this non-renewable component of the water cycle could be missing in Alpine water supplies.					; Farinotti, Daniel/OHR-6712-2025; Huss, Matthias/JLL-6340-2023	Huss, Matthias/0000-0002-2377-6923; Farinotti, Daniel/0000-0003-3417-4570; Pistocchi, Alberto/0000-0002-3696-873X; 													1748-9326					MAY	2016	11	5							054022	10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/054022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/054022													WOS:000376484300022

Late Pleistocene paleohydrology near the boundary of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, southeastern Arizona, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Ground-water discharge (GWD) deposits form in and environments as water tables rise and approach breach the ground surface during periods of enhanced effective precipitation. Where preserved, these deposits contain information on the timing and elevation of past ground-water fluctuations. Here we report on the investigation of a series of GWD deposits that are exposed in discontinuous outcrops a similar to 150-km stretch of the San Pedro Valley in southeastern Arizona, near the boundary of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Chronologic, isotopic, geochemical, faunal assemblage (ostracodes and gastropods), and sedimentological evidence collectively suggest that the elevation of the regional water table in the valley rose in response to a change in climate similar to 50 ka ago and remained relatively high for the next similar to 35 ka before falling during the Bolling-Allerod warm period, rebounding briefly during the Younger Dryas cold event, and falling again at the onset of the Holocene. The timing of these hydrologic changes coincides closely with variations in delta(18)O values of calcite from a nearby speleothem to the west and changes in lake levels at pluvial Lake Cochise to the east. Thus, in southeastern Arizona, the assumption that changes in climate are reflected in all aspects of the hydrologic cycle of a region simultaneously is validated. The timing of these changes also broadly coincides with variations in the GISP2 delta(18)O record, which supports the hypothesis that atmospheric teleconnections existed between the North Atlantic and the deserts of the American Southwest during the late Pleistocene.

J	Fischer, P; Öhl, U				Fischer, P; Öhl, U			Effects of water-level fluctuations on the littoral benthic fish community in lakes: a mesocosm experiment	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Changes in the water level of lakes, either natural or man-made, are important environmental perturbations for eulittoral benthic fish communities. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we tested the effects of decreasing shelter availability due to autumn lake-level decrease on the behavior and the growth of two littoral benthic dwellers, the juvenile burbot and the stone loach. The two species showed significantly different changes in behavior when shelter availability decreased. Burbot built up a distinct hierarchy when shelter became sparse, with larger fish being significantly more successful in competing for suitable shelter than smaller conspecifics. The hierarchy, however, ceased when shelter availability decreased below a certain level. The largest fish then increasingly abandoned shelter use, while smaller fish persisted with their sheltering behavior. Stone loach, in contrast, showed no hierarchical order or size-related shelter use. Only burbot showed a significant relationship between the ability to occupy the preferred shelter and the somatic growth. These two species provide an example of different strategies to deal with environmental perturbations like lake-level decrease, with the stenoecious, dominant strategy of the burbot and the euryoccious, evasive strategy of stone loach. The results demonstrate the importance of conducting behavioral studies under as natural conditions as possible.

Pronounced diel respiration cycles were observed in all systems, with a minimum in the morning and a maximum in the evening. Respiration was positively correlated with water temperature, incident light, and chlorophyll a concentration. Diel cycles of chlorophyll a were discernible in both rivers and in the oligo-mesotrophic lake. Our results show that a single morning sampling underestimates both respiration and chlorophyll a, whereas a single sample taken at noon generally agrees better with the average of four daily measurements. In oligotrophic Lac Croche, the photosynthetic parameter a(B) remained constant throughout the day, whereas P(m)(B) increased by 12.5% between 0600 h and 1300 h. Ignoring the diel community respiration cycle resulted in a similar to 25% underestimation of daily respiration, whereas ignoring the P(m)(B) cycle induced a similar to 9% underestimation of the daily primary production. The net balance between production (P) and respiration (R) of the oligotrophic lake epilimnion remained positive during two summers, and the P:R ratio showed net autotrophy for all systems except for the oligotrophic river, which was slightly net heterotrophic.

The sediment core was analyzed at 1 cm intervals for grain-size distribution and sedimentary component partition. These data provide a proxy record of the monsoon variability on millennial to centennial scales during the Holocene. We used a lognormal distribution function fitting method to partition three to six components from fine to coarse modes within the individual polymodal distributions into overlapping lognormal distributions. Three coarse components representing nearshore suspension, saltation and traction, together with the sand-fraction percentage and the median grain size of bulk samples, indicate the lake levels that fluctuated in response to the intensity of the monsoonal precipitation. Higher percentages of the nearshore components accompanied by more sand-fraction proportions and coarser median grain sizes reflect lower lake stands resulting from weaker monsoon circulations. The results show low levels at Hulun Lake c. 8000-7850, 6400-6050, 5150-4900, 4500-3800, 3050-2800, 1650-1400, 1150-900, 700-600, and 400-350 cal. yr.

We suggest that these weak monsoon events would not only result from the reduced ocean-atmosphere interacting processes in the western tropical Pacific, but could also be related to cold climatic conditions in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes.																			0959-6836					SEP	2009	19	6					899	908		10.1177/0959683609336574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683609336574													WOS:000269026100008

This paper integrates multi-dates Landsat 8 thermal data with extensive in situ measurements to retrieve LST of Alaska lakes, and analyses temperature patterns across spatial scales, intra and interlakes. Our analysis shows that inside a lake, LST is relatively homogeneous and largely isothermal under strong wind, while larger temperature difference may exist during calm days. Warmer or cooler temperature gradients along wind direction are found for both coastal and inland lakes. At regional scale, small, deep lakes and lakes in inland and/ or southern latitude are more likely to have higher mean temperatures across western ACP during summer season.

However, the exact organic matter (OM) sources in the sediments and their response to climatic variability still remain unclear. In this study, we present a 15.3-kyr n-alkane record extracted from lacustrine sediments in this swamp to explore the OM sources and the relationship between OM input and climatic changes. The results indicated that the n- alkane composition in sediments was dominated by long-chain n-alkanes (C27-C31), implying that the OM mainly originated from the terrestrial higher plants and emergent aquatic plants. The n-alkane data further verified that changes in OM sources were related to the surface erosion-transportation-deposition processes controlled by climatic changes. Lake level change, which was also regulated by climate conditions, played an important role in impacting OM accumulation; warmer and wetter conditions would result in rising lake levels that favored more aquatic OM and less terrestrial OM input, and vice versa. Variability of the Asian summer monsoon intensity regulated by the dynamic variations in low-latitude processes (e.g., solar insolation, intertropical convergence zone, and El Nin & SIM;o/Southern Oscillation), as well as high-latitude processes (e.g., meltwater input in the North Atlantic), was closely related to the OM accumulation in sediments.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2022	605								111217	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111217		SEP 2022											WOS:000861013900006
J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			Can oospore germination patterns explain charophyte distribution in permanent and temporary wetlands?	AQUATIC BOTANY												The patterns of germination of oospores of several species of charophytes were investigated to explain the distribution of charophytes in permanent and temporary wetlands in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Germination from seed banks and after storage was evaluated, Seed banks were pre-treated with combinations of temperature and moisture to simulate the effect of inundation in different seasons, Oospores of five species of Nitella and two species of Chara germinated from the seed banks, Nitella cristata var. ambigua, N. sonderi and N. subtilissima germinated in large numbers and the pattern and timing of emergence of these species was analysed, Nitella cristata var, ambigua, a winter germinating species, had relatively synchronous and early germination from seed banks when exposed to cues for the onset of winter. Nitella sonderi and N. subtilissima displayed extended germination from seed banks of wetlands that have variable water regimes. Drying the seed bank enhanced germination of these three species. Oospores collected from plants of four species were subject to different storage treatments and were germinated in vitro after 1, 3, 7, 9, 12 and 18 months of treatment. Oospores of Chara muelleri and C. australis germinated after storage, Nitella cristata var. ambigua germinated only in the control treatment and Nitella subtilissima did not germinate at all. Highest germination of C. muelleri (76%) occurred after oospores were subject to fluctuations in light intensity and temperature, whereas highest germination of C. australis (41%) occurred after oospores were kept wet for 4 months. Small oospores (680 mu m) of C. muelleri germinated sooner than large (1000 mu m) oospores after 1 month of storage. Oospores of C. muelleri that were stored for a short period of time (1 month) germinated faster and more synchronously than did oospores that were stored for longer. Charophytes in these temporary wetlands reduce the risk that all offspring will die in one unfavourable season by contributing to a dormant oospore bank and by having a pattern of germination that increases the likelihood of survival. Oospore germination patterns can help explain the distribution of charophytes in space and time.																			0304-3770					AUG	1996	54	4					297	312		10.1016/0304-3770(96)01032-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(96)01032-7													WOS:A1996VL39400004

It has a vital importance to Egypt for several decades because of the safe water supply of the country. Therefore, the water quality of the Lake Nasser must be profoundly investigated, and physico-chemical parameter changes of the water of the Lake Nasser should be continuously monitored and assessed. This work describes the present state of the physico-chemical (nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphate content, dissolved oxygen content, chemical oxygen demand, and biological oxygen demand) water parameters of Lake Nasser in Egypt at nine measurement sites along the Lake Nasser. The algorithm was devised at the University of Pannonia, Hungary, for the evaluation of the water quality. The aquatic environmental indices determined alongside the Lake Nasser fall into the category of "good" water quality at seven sampling sites and exhibited "excellent" water quality at two sampling sites according to Egyptian Governmental Decree No. 92/2013. In light of the tremendous demand for safe and healthy water supply in Egypt and international requirements, the water quality assessment is a very important tool for providing reliable information on the water quality. The protocol for water quality assessment could significantly contribute to the provision of high-quality water supply in Egypt. In conclusion, it can be stated that the parameters under investigation in different regions of Lake Nasser fall within the permissible ranges and the water of the Lake has good quality for drinking, irrigation, and fish cultures according to Egyptian standards; however, according to European specifications, there are steps to be accomplished for future water quality improvement.

However, the brevity of reconstructions of regional Pb pollution limits our understanding of the low-latitude Pb cycle. Here, we presented continuous stalagmite-based Pb records from Klang (KL) cave in the Thai-Malay peninsula, and complementary stalagmite-based Pb records from Xianrenyan (XRY) cave in upwind region to explore the combined effects of atmospheric circulations and anthropogenic Pb emissions on the regional Pb cycle in the low-latitude regions. The analysis suggests that the XRY records reflect regional Pb pollutions in southern China, while the KL records could represent regional Pb recycling in low-latitude Asia, with the Pb pollutants coming from local and upwind territories (e.g., China, India). Moreover, the Pb variations in peninsular Thailand are significantly influenced by the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) strength with high (low) amount of Pb pollutants from the upwind territories transported to the study area during the strong (weak) EAWM. However, by comparing KL records with XRY records and other existing geological and meteorological records, we found the EAWM-induced Pb variations in the late 20th century were overwhelmed by unprecedented industry-derived Pb emissions from eastern China. Our findings suggest the ever-increasing anthropogenic emission could surpass the atmospheric circulation controls on the regional Pb cycle, offering a new perspective on understanding the relative influence of natural and anthropogenic forcing.

J	Bergkemper, V; Weisse, T				Bergkemper, Victoria; Weisse, Thomas			Phytoplankton response to the summer 2015 heat wave - a case study from prealpine Lake Mondsee, Austria	INLAND WATERS												Phytoplankton response to a heat wave in deep prealpine Lake Mondsee, Austria, was minor overall, although temperature significantly affected the epilimnetic phytoplankton assemblage at the deepest site of the lake. We detected no significant effect of nutrients. Using 3 complementary optical methods-light microscopy (Utermohl technique), FlowCAM, and acoustic flow cytometry (AFC)-we found relatively low horizontal variation in the epilimnion but significant changes in phytoplankton community composition integrated over the 0-20 m water layer at the central station of the lake. These changes were mainly caused by a vertical shift in the Planktothrix rubescens peak from 11 to 16 m during the heat wave. Air temperatures reaching or exceeding 30 degrees C were measured in the area during 6 consecutive days at the end of June to the beginning of July, the first of 3 heat waves recorded during summer 2015; in-shore surface water temperature exceeded 27 degrees C. We sampled 9 stations across Lake Mondsee on 4 occasions during the heat wave and analysed temperature, nutrient levels, conductivity, pH, and the phytoplankton community. In addition to reporting the implications of increasing water temperatures for the algal assemblage in a deep stratified lake, we discuss the pros and cons of the different optical methods for phytoplankton identification and counting. For future field campaigns similar to the present study, we recommend using light microscopy to assess large or rare species, such as Ceratium hirundinella, and AFC, FlowCAM, or similar semi-automated devices for abundant small-to medium-sized species.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					88	99		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1294352													WOS:000405859800010

Our approach was based on 60 hydroacoustic transects covering the whole Lake Pareloup (France). Each transect was divided into sections 100 m long, constituting a total pattern of 732 sampling units. For each of them, the relationships between topographical characteristics (i.e. depth of the lake, distance from the bank, slope and depth at which the fish were located) and abundance of fishes were studied. Each environmental variable was divided into classes covering its range of variation. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test revealed significant heterogeneities of the data for each of the four variables. A pairwise comparison showed distinct patterns of fish density along the four topographical variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed and revealed a fish spatial distribution along a gradient of topographical variables. We established the relationships between fish densities and the four environmental variables, which revealed a clear fish summer habitat preference: the fish (predominantly roach) were mainly located in the surface stratum, in shallow gently sloping littoral areas. The fish distribution may be due to a trade-off between feeding, predation avoidance and endogenous fish requirements.

J	Maswi, MS; Mshiu, EE				Maswi, Mwita Solomon; Mshiu, Elisante Elisaimon			Remote sensing mapping of geothermal systems around Lake Natron in the east Africa rift system, northeastern Tanzania	GEOTHERMICS												The Lake Natron region is one of the potential geothermal resource areas in Tanzania, this is based on previous studies that focused on geology and the characteristics of the hot springs found in this region. However, the exact locations and sizes of the geothermal system(s)in this region are still unknown and require further exploration. This study used aeromagnetic data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, multispectral remote sensing Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data that is characterized with spatial resolution of up to 15 m and extended wavelength range to Shortwave Infrared Region (SWIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum, to identify potential areas for geothermal systems. The datasets were processed to produce geological structures, indicator mineral alterations for geothermal areas and land surface temperature (LST) anomalies, which were used as proxies to the geothermal systems. Remote sensing data were processed using various techniques to improve the signals from geological features of interest. In the processing of ASTER data, the processing techniques included band ratios, false composite images, and supervised classification. Field observation was conducted to verify the results along with geological mapping and identification of geological features around geothermal manifestations. Aeromagnetic and SRTM data analysis allowed to interpret surface and subsurface structures, and compare them with the field observations. Results have revealed that the main structural trend is NE-SW, which agrees with the field evidence. This trend reflects the regional tectonic framework and the influence of major faults. Field mapping realized the presence of geothermal manifestations such as hot springs with temperatures range between 32 degrees C and 51 degrees C, and pH range between 8 and 11. All hot springs are located along the mapped structures and major faults of the East African Rift System. Some parts of the study area are characterized by LST anomalies and indicator mineral alterations such as clays, sulfates, carbonates and ferric iron, these are characteristic geothermal manifestations in geothermal systems. Overall observation has also revealed a good match between remote sensing mapped mineral alterations, LST anomalies and other geothermal surface manifestations, this includes also geothermal favorable structure settings such as bend in normal faults, displacement transfer zones and horse tail structures. Despite the prominent results from this study, there is still a need for detailed investigation using high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensing data, time series thermal infrared (TIR) data, the best fit LST inversion method, along with other geological information (e.g. MT/TM geophysical surveys and geochemistry) to further validate the identified geothermal system.																			0375-6505	1879-3576				MAY	2024	119								102930	10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.102930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.102930		JAN 2024											WOS:001171857700001

VERY HIGH POPULATION ESTIMATES AND LIMITED MOVEMENT OF SNAIL-KILLING FLIES (DIPTERA: SCIOMYZIDAE) ON AN IRISH TURLOUGH (TEMPORARY LAKE)	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Sciomyzid flies (Diptera) have potential as biological control agents of intermediate hosts of snail-borne trematode diseases and as bioindicators of habitat condition and quality (particularly hydrology and vegetation structure). Standard area sweep net sampling of these flies in a single vegetation zone across ten turloughs in summer 2004 highlighted the importance of vegetation structure (standing height and outstretched length) on the abundance and species richness of Sciomyzidae. A mark recapture study was initiated in the summer of 2005 with the aim of quantifying absolute populations at one site where sciomyzid abundance was particularly high (Cregaclare South, Co. Galway). The total abundance of Sciomyzidae at the site was estimated at 3512 flies over an area of 600 square metres. This density (6.08 flies per square metre) is considerably higher than densities previously reported in two studies of a sciomyzid species in the USA, but is in line with estimates from the 2004 wider study. Specific markings were used in the 2005 mark recapture study to monitor any adult fly movements within the habitat. Females in two out of the three univoltine species showed a positive correlation in the proportion of gravid individuals caught over time. Multivoltine species showed no such relationship. Additionally, multivariate procedures were used to investigate the effect of date of sampling and spatial position on sciomyzid assemblage composition.																			0791-7945	2009-003X				SEP	2010	110B	2					81	94		10.3318/BIOE.2010.110.2.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/BIOE.2010.110.2.81													WOS:000283482400002

Coupled Arsenotrophy in a Hot Spring Photosynthetic Biofilm at Mono Lake, California	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Red-pigmented biofilms grow on rock and cobble surfaces present in anoxic hot springs located on Paoha Island in Mono Lake. The bacterial community was dominated (similar to 85% of 16S rRNA gene clones) by sequences from the photosynthetic Ectothiorhodospira genus. Scraped biofilm materials incubated under anoxic conditions rapidly oxidized As(III) to As(V) in the light via anoxygenic photosynthesis but could also readily reduce As(V) to As(III) in the dark at comparable rates. Back-labeling experiments with (73)As(V) demonstrated that reduction to (73)As(III) also occurred in the light, thereby illustrating the cooccurrence of these two anaerobic processes as an example of closely coupled arsenotrophy. Oxic biofilms also oxidized As(III) to As(V). Biofilms incubated with [(14)C] acetate oxidized the radiolabel to (14)CO(2) in the light but not the dark, indicating a capacity for photoheterotrophy but not chemoheterotrophy. Anoxic, dark-incubated samples demonstrated As(V) reduction linked to additions of hydrogen or sulfide but not acetate. Chemoautotrophy linked to As(V) as measured by dark fixation of [(14)C] bicarbonate into cell material was stimulated by either H(2) or HS(-). Functional genes for the arsenate respiratory reductase (arrA) and arsenic resistance (arsB) were detected in sequenced amplicons of extracted DNA, with about half of the arrA sequences closely related (similar to 98% translated amino acid identity) to those from the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae. Surprisingly, no authentic PCR products for arsenite oxidase (aoxB) were obtained, despite observing aerobic arsenite oxidation activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate close linkages of these arsenic redox processes occurring within these biofilms.

J	Wagner, C; Adrian, R				Wagner, Carola; Adrian, Rita			Consequences of changes in thermal regime for plankton diversity and trait composition in a polymictic lake: a matter of temporal scale	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Changes in plankton species diversity and community structure as a result of global warming are of growing concern in ecological studies, as these properties contribute substantially to key ecosystem processes. 2. We analysed the effect of short-term temperature rise and changes in the thermal regime during summer on plankton diversity of the eutrophic and polymictic Muggelsee in Germany, from 26 years of summer records (1982-2007). We tested for changes in community properties, such as species richness, evenness and population size of phyto- and zooplankton, during alternating periods of thermal stratification and mixing, which were between 2 and 8 weeks long. Moreover, we tested for overall long-term temporal trends in annual averages of the community properties during stratified and mixed events. 3. We found that the overall number of stratification events increased significantly across the study period. When the lake was stratified, consistently higher surface water temperatures and lower epilimnetic nutrient concentrations were found. As the length of thermal stratification increased, the phytoplankton shifted towards a higher proportion of buoyant cyanobacteria capable of N-fixation (Aphanizomenon, Anabaena). Diatoms were at a disadvantage because of high temperature, exceeding their upper lethal limit and sedimentation losses. Zooplankton species with high thermal tolerances (i.e. Thermocyclops oithonoides, Thermocyclops crassus) and/or those that grow quickly at high temperatures (i.e. rotifers) became more common. 4. During periods of continuous mixing, the community remained largely unchanged, except for some minor increase in the biomass of diatoms. 5. While a noticeable shift towards N-fixing cyanobacteria was observed with increasing length of stratified events, and rotifers and copepods became the main predators, there were minimal changes in diversity, except for an increase in cyclopoid copepods and a decrease in diatom diversity. As for cyanobacteria, the net short-term effect on their diversity was neutral as a result of species replacements. In the long term, however, the diversity of cyanobacteria and cladocerans declined while that of rotifers increased. 6. Overall, our study presents a cautionary example of how we might fail to foresee the impact of climate-induced changes on ecosystem processes if we restrict our studies to seasonal or yearly temporal scales, thus neglecting the impact of substantial changes operating at smaller temporal scales.

This spill could occur because the Enbridge Line 5 oil pipeline traverses the Straits between Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsula. We quantify potential economic damages to outdoor recreation, commercial fishing, shipping, residential properties, and energy and water supplies. Damages are estimated for two spill scenarios occurring at the onset of the summer tourism season with extensive shoreline oiling. Using evidence from past spills, economic damages would last for between one and two years and would affect locations on the periphery of the spill area, depending on the activity. We project the loss from the worst-case scenario would be at least $1.3 billion. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the Indian subcontinent, significant number of studies have focussed on understanding the Holocene aridification events at 8.2 and 4.2 ka. Despite these studies, high resolution palaeoclimatic records from the eastern India during Holocene, particularly around the above-mentioned aridification events are lacking. In this study, we present high resolution Holocene palaeoclimate records reconstructed based on geochemical and isotopic data from the Chilika Lagoon located in the east coast of India. A 130 cm long sediment core, retrieved from the southern end of the lagoon, revealed a continuous sedimentation history between 8.49 and 0.99 ka. The variations in organic carbon isotopic compositions, total organic carbon contents, along with major and trace element abundances suggested a strong effect of 8.2 dry event and a shift in chemical weathering at around 4.2 ka in the eastern coast of India. Additionally, a strong warm climate anomaly was observed at 1.2 ka. Interestingly, higher sedimentation rates were observed post 4.2 ka, which potentially indicated a significant change in settlement dynamics and human interventions. It appears that the eastern coast of India experienced human migration and surge in agricultural practices similar to that in northwest India after the 4.2 ka climatic event. It is likely that people relocated themselves, which eventually increased the pastoral activities in newly occupied lands. Consequently, enhanced land use and land cover changes accelerated soil erosion in the region leading to higher sedimentation rate in the lagoon.

J	FURCH, K				FURCH, K			SEASONAL-VARIATION OF WATER CHEMISTRY OF THE MIDDLE AMAZON VARZEA-LAKE LAGO CALADO	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The Lago Calado is situated in the inundation area of the Amazon, the so-called varzea, between the Amazon River itself to which it is connected by a channel, and the adjacent noninundated land. Due to the location of the lake it is influenced by inflowing water from the Amazon, land runoff and from rainwater falling directly into the lake basin. Since the Amazon water is relatively rich in electrolytes and both rainwater and runoff are extremely poor in them, the chemistry of the lake water will vary according to the varying mixture of the 3 waters. Monthly samples of surface waters from the Amazon and 2 localities in the lake were studied from 1974-1977 for 31 mo. Concentrations of major cations, major anions, Si, H and dissolved solids (as specific conductance) were determined. The Amazon River shows a regular change of its water level with maxima in July and Aug. and minima in Nov. and Dec. The variation of its chemical quality is less regular. The lake varies regularly with regard to both its level and the chemical quality of its water. Lowest concentrations in the lake water were observed in Dec./Jan. when water level was lowest. At that time no river water flows into the lake; it receives rainwater and land runoff both being extremely low in electrolyes. Ion concentrations in the lake water increase with rising water level, when Amazon water, relatively rich in electrolytes flows into the basin. They decrease with falling water level, when rainwater and land runoff, both poor in electrolytes, again dilute the lake water. Not all changes of chemical composition and ion concentration observed in the lake water are due to mixing of the above 3 waters. The chemical impacts of lake sediments and decomposition processes of aquatic macrophytes on the lake water quality are also discussed.																			0003-9136						1982	95	OCT					47	67																WOS:A1982PV20900004

The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmidt, Hyde, Steigerwaldt & Brenner was cultured from the nymph of a blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, that had been removed from a common yellowthroat, Geothlypis trichas L., from Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia. As a result of bird movement, a nymphal I. scapularis removed from a Swainson's thrush, Catharus ustulatus incanus (Godfrey), at Slave Lake, Alberta, during spring migration becomes the new, most western and northern record of this tick species in Canada. Amblyomma longirostre Koch,Amblyomma sabanerae Stoll, and Ixodes baergi Cooley & Kohls are reported for the first time in Canada. Similarly, Amblyomma americanum L., Amblyomma maculatum Koch, and Ixodes muris Bishopp & Smith are reported for the first time on birds in Canada. After removal of an I. muris gravid female from a song sparrow, Melospiza melodia Wilson, at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, eggs were laid, which developed into larvae, and this new tick-host record demonstrates that birds have the potential to start a new tick population. We conclude that passerine birds disperse several species of ixodid ticks in Canada, and during spring migration translocate ticks from the United States, and Central and South America, some of which are infected with B. burgdorferi.

The Interaction of Large Amplitude Internal Seiches with a Shallow Sloping Lakebed: Observations of Benthic Turbulence in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada	PLOS ONE												Observations of the interactions of large amplitude internal seiches with the sloping boundary of Lake Simcoe, Canada show a pronounced asymmetry between up-and downwelling. Data were obtained during a 42-day period in late summer with an ADCP and an array of four thermistor chains located in a 5 km line at the depths where the thermocline intersects the shallow slope of the lakebed. The thermocline is located at depths of 12-14 m during the strongly stratified period of late summer. During periods of strong westerly winds the thermocline is deflected as much as 8 m vertically and interacts directly with the lakebed at depth between 14-18 m. When the thermocline was rising at the boundary, the stratification resembles a turbulent bore that propagates up the sloping lakebed with a speed of 0.05-0.15 m s(-1) and a Froude number close to unity. There were strong temperature overturns associated with the abrupt changes in temperature across the bore. Based on the size of overturns in the near bed stratification, we show that the inferred turbulent diffusivity varies by up to two orders of magnitude between up-and downwellings. When the thermocline was rising, estimates of turbulent diffusivity were high with K-Z similar to 10(-4) m 2 s(-1), whereas during downwelling events the near-bed stratification was greatly increased and the turbulence was reduced. This asymmetry is consistent with previous field observations and underlines the importance of shear-induced convection in benthic bottom boundary layers of stratified lakes.					; Cossu, Remo/C-6085-2016; wells, mathew/A-7101-2012	, Remo/0000-0002-1712-6692; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202													1932-6203					MAR 5	2013	8	3							e57444	10.1371/journal.pone.0057444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057444								23472085					WOS:000315637900023

Due to the lack of proper management and sustainable utilization, groundwater has been overdrawn, causing serious land subsidence and seawater intrusion. The present paper presents a pilot study for artificially recharging groundwater using high-infiltration basins. Results of the geometric factor show that the large basin is ca. 6.8 times the size of the small one, with the infiltration volume almost approaching 1 m(3)/day/m(2). In the groundwater variation, the MW-2 is located immediately below the infiltration basin; therefore, its water level rises more rapidly than that of MW-3. As for the infiltration volume, results of the experiment used the same basin since 2002, which shows that the volumes gradually decreased from 12,136 to 5,555 m(3)/day. This is particularly evident in 2005 when volume decrease was at a maximum ca. 2,000 m(3)/day. Finally, the infiltration rate decreased from 22.76 to 7.15 m/day. The difference in infiltration rate between 2003 and 2005 has a maximum variation from to 15.2 to 10.33 m/day. In 2003, the addition of sand caused the infiltration rate to fall to a minimum ca. 5.3 m/day. By extending the recharge time, the infiltration rate fell gradually similar to those identified from 2005 to 2007.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2011	63	1					77	85		10.1007/s12665-010-0670-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-010-0670-8													WOS:000289366100006

Water Balance and Slope Stability in a Changing Climate: Combinatorial Influences of Rainfall and Snowmelt-Induced Himalayan Geohazards	INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL												Stability analysis of slopes and water balance studies in Indian mountainous regions under normal temperature conditions and rainfall are well explored. However, in cold regions such as the glaciated Himalayan areas, negative temperatures and snowmelt water play a crucial role in governing water dynamics and stability of terrain slopes. These aspects of cold region engineering are still in a very developing stage in India, despite the vulnerability of the Indian Himalayan regions to geohazards. The present study aims to address this gap by examining the effect of negative temperatures and snowfall during winters, and the influence of snowmelt water in addition to rainfall during summers, on stability of sloping terrain and the water balance dynamics in Indian Himalayan region. Slope profiles consisting of homogeneous soils and reconstituted varved clay slopes are utilized in the study, using two soil types, namely red soil (RS) and black soil (BS). The homogeneous slope profiles consist solely of either RS or BS. For reconstituted varved clay slope profiles, RS and BS are arranged in layers of 2, 4, 8, and 16 in two different sequential arrangements. In one sequential arrangement, BS constitutes the topmost lamina, whereas in the other, RS constitutes the topmost lamina. Results indicate that the slope failure, the area affected by failed soil mass, water infiltration into the sloping terrain, and runoff vary among different slope profiles. These variations are observed under different climatic scenarios, which include consideration of water from rain only (RW) and water from both rain and snowmelt (RW+SW). In the RW+SW climate scenario, early slope failures and increased water runoff are observed compared to RW. Accelerated water infiltration leads to earlier attainment of maximum cumulative infiltration and earlier runoff initiation in RW+SW scenario compared to RW. These output parameters also vary with the thicknesses and sequential arrangement of laminae in reconstituted varved clay slopes. For the same number of laminae, slope failure and maximum net cumulative infiltration occur later when BS is the topmost lamina. Further, with this arrangement, the area of the failed soil mass is also smaller in comparison to the scenario when RS is the topmost lamina.

Numerous high-quality single-site paleotemperature records have been produced for the eastern part of the SR (mainly for the Xinjiang region and its surrounding areas), which provide the data basis for a comprehensive synthesis. In this study, we used objective criteria to select 10 high-quality ones from 30 temperature reconstructions derived from various geological archives including lacustrine sediments, ice cores, and tree rings in this region. Our aims are to summarize the pattern of temperature change over the past 2000 years, to provide a long-term viewpoint on the present warming, and to evaluate the impact of climate change on civilizations along the SR. The principal results are as follows: (1) The temperature variations over the last millennium are mutually consistent within these records. The study area experienced typical climate anomalies during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, AD 1000-1250), the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1450-1850), and the Current Warm Period (CWP, AD 1850 to present); however, contrary to previous knowledge, the amplitude of climatic warming during the CWP did not exceed that during the MWP. (2) Fewer temperature records were available for the interval AD 1-1000, and there were large differences between them. For example, the reconstructed climate during both the Han Dynasty and the Sui-Tang Dynasties was either warm or cold, without prevailing consensus. (3) The warming during the MWP favored the rapid development of the SR route along the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, and the cooling during the LIA contributed to the decline of the SR marked by the closure of the Jiayuguan Pass. Notably, the scarcity of temperature records and the discrepancies between them during AD 1-1000 in the eastern part of the SR have hindered our understanding of the hydroclimatic changes and their influence on the development of civilizations along the SR. Thus, it is important to obtain an increased number of high-quality reliable records spanning the past 2000 year, and to examine the occurrence of local signals of temperature changes during the period of AD 1-1000. On the other hand, the paleotemperature investigation on the western part of the SR over the last two millennia is wholly insufficient, and thus more high-quality single-site and integrated studies are needed, to facilitate more comprehensive insights into the coupled relationship between climate change and the rise and fall of civilizations along the entire length of the Silk Road.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the groundwater quality and effects of lithogenic contamination carried out in the Lake Seyfe basin, which is represented by various lithologies and groundwater types. Seyfe, Horla and Akpinar springs are recharged through marbles at the western and southwestern of the basin are ultimately and discharged into the Kizilirrmak Formation and Lake Seyfe. The waters of deep wells drilled into the marbles are of bicarbonate type (type I) in the Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-HCO(3)(-) and Ca2(+)-HCO(3)(-) facies.Ozluhuyuk spring and waters from most of trenches and shallow wells, which are fed by the Kizilirmak Formation, have a mixed (type II) composition in the Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-HCO(3)(-)-Cl(-) facies. Groundwater in the alluvium and Kizilirmak Formation along Lake Seyfe has a salty (type III) character in the Na(+)-Cl(-) facies. The main reasons of formation and change of the groundwater salinity and hydrochemical facies in the Seyfe basin are causing the various (a) lithogenic pollution and heterogeneity of the Kizilirmak Formation, (b) salinity of the upper soil zones, and (c) evaporation of the trench and channel waters open to the atmosphere. Considering parameters such as sodium hazard, specific conductivity, bicarbonate and carbonate hazards, waters in the study area are generally suitable for agricultural usage.																			0943-0105					AUG	2008	55	3					559	569		10.1007/s00254-007-1007-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1007-0													WOS:000257581800008

Contrary to their conclusion that minor element chemistry is not influenced by temperature, we find a very strong statistical correlation (r = 0.97) between temperature and shell chemistry in their data. This discrepancy apparently arises due to their use of a partition coefficient model of shell chemistry that masks a number of strong correlations in their data. We argue here that the partition coefficient model is not appropriate for this biologically mediated carbonate, and that a broader range of possible controls on shell chemistry needs to be tested.																			0921-2728					MAY	2002	27	4					487	491		10.1023/A:1020535820345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020535820345													WOS:000178211900007
J	Van Vrancken, J; O'Connell, M				Van Vrancken, Jeffrey; O'Connell, Martin			Effects of Hurricane Katrina on Freshwater Fish Assemblages in a Small Coastal Tributary of Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Hurricane Katrina struck southeastern Louisiana on 29 August 2005 and thereby created an opportunity to examine the effects of a catastrophic storm on fish assemblages in a coastal stream. Bayou Lacombe is a small (46.1 river kilometers), primarily freshwater stream that drains into the northeastern portion of Lake Pontchartrain, a large oligohaline estuary located north of New Orleans. In summer 2005 (prior to the hurricane), three upstream and three downstream reaches of Bayou Lacombe were surveyed by electrofishing. These same six reaches were resurveyed in the summer of 2006 to assess the effects of the hurricane on fish assemblages. There were significant changes in fish assemblages at the downstream and upstream reaches. At the downstream reaches, centrarchid species such as bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, warmouth L. gulosus, and redspotted sunfish L. miniatus increased in abundance after the hurricane, as did inland silverside Menidia beryllina and striped mullet Mugil cephalus, both estuarine-dependent species. At the upstream reaches, longear sunfish L. megalotis decreased after the hurricane and weed shiners Notropis texanus, goldstriped darters Etheostoma parvipinne, and warmouth were absent from posthurricane samples. Principal components and BEST analyses showed that differences in dissolved oxygen between years were related to fish assemblage changes in the upstream reaches. Salinity and temperature were associated with fish assemblage changes in the downstream reaches. Similar significant changes could occur in other coastal streams prone to increased hurricane activity.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2010	139	6					1723	1732		10.1577/T09-217.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-217.1													WOS:000286095500009

However, existing assessments of hydrological connectivity have focused on the damming effect on upstream-downstream connectivity, neglecting the impact on "off-stream" floodplains and resulting in an underestimation of dam's overall impact. This study took the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydroelectric dam, as an example to assess its impact on the hydrological connectivity of the Yangtze-connected floodplain, Poyang Lake, through hydrodynamic modeling. The results revealled significant alterations caused by the dam construction, particularly during the receding period. The connectivity function (CF), representing the ability of water movement in different directions, was found to decrease due to the TGD. The average reduction in the North -South CF was 17.38 %, while the West -East CF decreased by an average of 13.62 %. Moreover, the dam's most pronounced impact was observed during specific periods. The average shrinkage of the connected object (CONNOB) was 55.17 % during drought years, 83.25 % during normal years, and 64.61 % during flood years. Additionally, these CONNOBs exhibited fragmentation, indicating a disrupted hydrological network. Furthermore, the dam-induced changes affected the timing of the longest connected period in the seasonal isolated lake. On average, during normal years, this period began 69.41 days earlier and ended 70.36 days earlier. The intensification of autumn drought caused by the emptying effect of the TGD is the underlying mechanism of the weakened hydrological connectivity in Poyang Lake. This study provides new insights into assessing the impact of dams on hydrological connectivity and can improve the current assessment framework, leading to better ecological and environmental benefits of water management related to hydrological connectivity adjustment.					; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; Tan, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-2853-4584; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2024	629								130619	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130619		JAN 2024											WOS:001164365700001
J	Cann, JH; Bourman, RP; Barnett, EJ				Cann, JH; Bourman, RP; Barnett, EJ			Holocene foraminifera as indicators of relative estuarine-lagoonal and oceanic influences in estuarine sediments of the River Murray, South Australia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												In southeastern South Australia, the River Murray debouches through a coastal barrier separating euryhaline estuarine-lagoonal waters from the Southern Ocean. Depending upon the relative freshwater outflow of the river and ingress of the ocean, water salinity varies greatly within the lower estuary. Ammonia beccarii and Elphidium articulatum are euryhaline species of foraminifera that characterize the estuary and back-barrier Coorong Lagoon. The inner-shelf marine environment hosts an assemblage in which Discorbis dimidiatus, E. crispum, E. macelliforme, and various cibicidid species predominate. In cored sediments recovered from the shallow lower estuary, the relative abundance of A. beccarii + E. articulatum was compared with that of D. dimidiatus + E. crispum + E. macelliforme + other species. These data, and AMS radiocarbon ages determined for foraminifera and ostracods, provide evidence of a change from maximum oceanic influence (5255 +/- 60 yr B.P,) to maximum estuarine influence (3605 +/- 70 yr B.P.). Over this same time interval, sea level fell relatively by about 2 m. However, the event was also contemporaneous with falling water levels in several Victorian lakes, and it is thus attributed to onset of climatic aridity. Reduced precipitation in the River Murray catchment and reduced freshwater outflow enhanced development of the flood-tide delta and constriction of the mouth. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

These statements have been confronted with the real situations which exist in 24 different lakes, reservoirs and ponds which have been studied by the listed members of PEG. The confrontation of the model which empirical data reveals a major dichotomy in the successional pathways which occur in lakes with and without elevated levels of summer algal biomass. This dichotomy together with other significant features such as the extent of grazing pressure are compared with the traditional distinction of water bodies into trophic types (eutrophic, oligotrophic). Succession in plankton is understood to be predictable and directional although it may be disturbed by irregular physical events.																			0003-9136					JUN	1986	106	4					433	471																WOS:A1986D326000001
J	Bowman, D; Devora, S; Svoray, T				Bowman, Dan; Devora, Shlomo; Svoray, Tal			Drainage organization on the newly emerged Dead Sea bed, Israel	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The organization of distributary drainage systems on the emerging coastal areas of the Dead Sea was studied, following a rapid base-level fall of 24 m during the period 1945-2002 which made the emerging pristine coastal zone a natural field laboratory. Photogrammetric digital elevation models were extracted to identify different emerged areas and to quantify erosion and deposition processes. Visual interpretation of ortho-photos was used in order to recognize different drainage networks and to delineate the receding shoreline. The remotely-sensed data were backed by field surveys including measurement of longitudinal profiles. The study demonstrates the spatial variability of runoff allocation from prograding fans to the emerging areas and the variable drainage responses. Three distinct environments were revealed on the emerged areas from the coast to the land: deeply incised channels which are the main transmitters of the base-level effect headward; dendritic coalescing systems that are the reversal of the diverging channel system on alluvial fans; and areas with unconfined sheet flowouts, which are detached from base-level control. The threshold gradient of erosion on the emerged areas is similar to 3 degrees. Headward erosion was uncoupled with the lake level drop, i.e. the rate of headword entrenchment increased with time, despite an almost constant base-level fall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Seventeen species were identified from these species-poor communities, with 1 to 6 species each. Dissotrocha macrostyla and Philodina citrina were the most common species, present in 10 lakes while 9 species were collected from one lake only. New morphological details from S.E.M. pictures of Dissotrocha macrostyla revealed that Dissotrocha macrostyla tuberculata (GOSSE, 1886) is only a seasonal morphotype. Its different appearance is due to the presence of locally distributed microscopic mucous bubbles (diameter 1.41 +/- 0.18 mum) on the trunk surface, produced by the rotifer itself under stressful conditions.

Addition of iron (Fe) salts has been used to enhance P retention in lake sediments. However, its effects on sediment geochemistry are poorly studied, albeit pivotal for remediation success. Here, we assess the factors controlling the retention of P and longterm effects following application of FeCl3 (0.5-1 mol Fe/m2, 2010) in the eutrophic, shallow peat lake Terra Nova (the Netherlands). Treatment reduced P levels in the lake for two years, but afterwards summer release of P intensified, resulting in higher surface water P concentrations than before treatment. Porewater and sediment analyses indicate that the majority of the added Fe is still undergoing redox cycling within the top 10 cm of sediment accounting for the binding of up to 70 % of sedimentary P. Sequential extractions further suggest that organic matter (OM) plays a key role in the resulting P and Fe dynamics: While reduction of P binding Fe(III) phases results in P release to porewaters, the produced Fe2+ remains bound to the solid phase presumably stabilized by OM. This causes P release from the sediments in excess to Fe during temporary low oxygen conditions in summer months, as confirmed by whole core flux incubation experiments. Quantitative coprecipitation of P with Fe upon reoxygenation of the water body is then impossible, leading to a gradual increase in surface water P. This first long-term study on a shallow peat lake underpins the role of OM for Fe cycling and the need to carefully consider the sediment properties and diagenetic pathways in the planning of Fe-amendments.

J	Luoto, TP; Nevalainen, L				Luoto, Tomi P.; Nevalainen, Liisa			Quantifying climate changes of the Common Era for Finland	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In this study, we aim to quantify summer air temperatures from sediment records from Southern, Central and Northern Finland over the past 2000 years. We use lake sediment archives to estimate paleotemperatures applying fossil Chironomidae assemblages and the transfer function approach. The used enhanced Chironomidae-based temperature calibration set was validated in a 70-year high-resolution sediment record against instrumentally measured temperatures. Since the inferred and observed temperatures showed close correlation, we deduced that the new calibration model is reliable for reconstructions beyond the monitoring records. The 700-year long temperature reconstructions from three sites at multi-decadal temporal resolution showed similar trends, although they had differences in timing of the cold Little Ice Age (LIA) and the initiation of recent warming. The 2000-year multi-centennial reconstructions from three different sites showed resemblance with each other having clear signals of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and LIA, but with differences in their timing. The influence of external forcing on climate of the southern and central sites appeared to be complex at the decadal scale, but the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was closely linked to the temperature development of the northern site. Solar activity appears to be synchronous with the temperature fluctuations at the multi-centennial scale in all the sites. The present study provides new insights into centennial and decadal variability in air temperature dynamics in Northern Europe and on the external forcing behind these trends. These results are particularly useful in comparing regional responses and lags of temperature trends between different parts of Scandinavia.

Benthic assemblages in intermittent streams are subject to further constraints through the recurrent dry phase of their habitats (BOULTON & LAKE 1990). As macroinvertebrates are involved in various processes in stream ecosystems (WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996), their distribution patterns may affect ecosystem functions. Decomposition of organic matter is a crucial ecosystem process, recycling nutrients and supporting detrital based food webs. The significance of fragmentation of coarse organic matter by the functional feeding group shredders is well recognized (ANDERSON & SEDELL 1979, WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996, GRACA 2001). The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of shredders in 3 intermittent streams. We hypothesized that shredder diversity and abundance would be highest at sites with (1) a shorter duration of summer drought, and (2) forest riparian vegetation; and that (3) recovery of shredders after summer drought would be slower at sites with longer dry phase.

Paleoclimate records indicate summer insolation and North Atlantic paleotemperature changes forced variations in monsoon rainfall through the Holocene, resulting in hydrologic and ecologic changes in plateau watersheds. We present a record of Holocene hydrologic variability in the Yarlung Tsangpo (YT) valley of the southern Tibetan Plateau, based on sedimentology and C-14 dating of organic-rich 'black mats' in paleowetlands deposits, that shows changes in wetlands extent in response to changing monsoon intensity. Four sedimentary units indicate decreasing monsoon intensity since 10.4 ka BR. Wet conditions occurred at similar to 10.4 ka BP, similar to 9.6 ka BP and similar to 7.9-4.8 ka BP, with similar-to-modern conditions from similar to 4.6-2.0 ka BP, and drier-than-modern conditions from similar to 2.0 ka BP to present. Wetland changes correlate with monsoon intensity changes identified in nearby records, with weak monsoon intervals corresponding to desiccation and erosion of wetlands. Dating of in situ ceramic and microlithic artifacts within the wetlands indicates Epipaleolithic human occupation of the YT valley after 6.6 ka BP, supporting evidence for widespread colonization of the Tibetan Plateau in the early and mid-Holocene during warm, wet post-glacial conditions.

This work analyses the physical interpretation of the statistics of lake ice time series illustrated by available data. The results provide tools to understand variations in the past lake ice seasons and to make projections into the future. The freezing date is related to fall air temperature with correlation time scale depending on the lake depth. Ice growth is primarily determined by the air temperature and snow accumulation. Ice break-up depends on the seasonal maximum ice and snow thicknesses, solar radiation and air temperature; the onset of melting is the primary question. Relationships are derived for ice season characteristics and climate changes. Warmer climate also brings qualitative changes to lake ice seasons by moving boundaries of ice climate zones.

Contribution of ferric iron to light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study experimentally determined the contribution of ferric iron (Fe(III)) associated with humic substances (HS) to light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The associations between Fe(III) and HS (HS-Fe) were generated by mixing HS standards with Fe(III) in acidic conditions and adjusting pH to 8. HS-associated Fe was separated from total Fe by filtering (0.7 mu m and 0.2 mu m filters) and by removing the free Fe ions by cation exchange chromatography. The maximum Fe-binding capacities (at pH 8) of Suwannee River humic acid, Suwannee River fulvic acid, and Pony Lake (Antarctica) fulvic acid were 13.0, 13.5, and 7.64 mu mol Fe [mg C](-1), respectively, indicating that wetland-derived HS had a higher Fe-binding capacity than plankton-derived HS. HS-associated Fe increased the absorption coefficient of CDOM by up to several fold in the visible range of the spectrum and reduced the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM. The Fe-induced increase in light absorption was spectrally similar among different HS examined. The Fe-specific absorption coefficient spectrum for HS-associated Fe (a(lambda,Fe)*) was calculated from the Fe-induced increase in light absorption by normalizing it with the concentration of Fe in the HS pool. The a(lambda,Fe)* was adopted in estimation of the contribution of HS-associated Fe to light absorption by CDOM in 13 circum-neutral natural waters collected from a spring, 10 major rivers, a lake, and a coastal area. HS-associated Fe was calculated to be responsible for from 0.6% (Mississippi River) to 56.4% (Loytynlahde spring) of light absorption by CDOM at a wavelength of 410 nm. This study shows that HS-associated Fe can be an important component in light absorption by CDOM and also influence the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM.

Large-scale estimates of the role of lakes and reservoirs in the carbon cycle, however, typically must rely on aggregation of spatially and temporally inconsistent data from disparate sources. We performed a spatially comprehensive analysis of CO2 concentration and air-water fluxes in lakes and reservoirs of the contiguous United States using large, consistent data sets, and modeled the relative contribution of inorganic and organic carbon loading to vertical CO2 fluxes. Approximately 70% of lakes and reservoirs are supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the summer (June-September). Although there is considerable interregional and intraregional variability, lakes and reservoirs represent a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of approximately 40 Gg C d(-1) during the summer. While in-lake CO2 concentrations correlate with indicators of in-lake net ecosystem productivity, virtually no relationship exists between dissolved organic carbon and pCO(2,aq). Modeling suggests that hydrologic dissolved inorganic carbon supports pCO(2,aq) in most supersaturated systems (to the extent that 12% of supersaturated systems simultaneously exhibit positive net ecosystem productivity), and also supports primary production in most CO2-undersaturated systems. Dissolved inorganic carbon loading appears to be an important determinant of CO2 concentrations and fluxes across the air-water interface in the majority of lakes and reservoirs in the contiguous United States.

During both years of observation, the number of seals in the haul-outs gradually decreased, which might have been due to the wave level on the lake. Contrary to the popular belief the largest seal haul-out being on the Tonkiy Island, the greatest number of seals was recorded on the Dolgiy and Kruglyi islands.

Lake Barrancs is located downstream of the Tempestats and Barrancs cirque glaciers and sedimentation is dominated by clastic input corresponding to seasonal changes in sediment supply. Slow fine particle settling during the winter and sediment-loaded homopycnal flows during the warm season, triggered by snow-melting and glacier outwash, have resulted in deposition of rhythmites composed of clays, silts, and sands. The predominance of finer-grained sediments and the low concentration of relatively finer magnetite grains suggest that glacier activity was very small, if not absent, before ca. A.D. 350. Their replacement by coarser-grained sediments and the overall increased (but highly oscillating) concentrations of relatively coarser magnetite grains in the uppermost 4.3 m of the record suggest the onset of glacial activity and enhanced snow-melting in the catchment of Lake Barrancs after A.D. 350. We suggest that this onset of glacial and enhanced snow-melt activity was driven by a complex balance between winter precipitation and annual mean temperatures, among other climatic variables. Peat layers suggest two dramatic lake-level drops at A.D. 300 and A.D. 450, when Lake Barrancs was drained. The mechanisms for such extreme hydrological events are not clear. Changes in the precipitation/evaporation ratio cannot account for such desiccation events. Dam failure is unlikely since there are no geomorphological evidence of breaching processes. Geomorphological and structural evidence demonstrates active faulting since formation of Lake Barrancs and reactivation during earthquake shaking. Based on this, we propose an alternative explanation for the desiccation events that involves the draining of the lake through pre-existing fractures opened by earthquakes. Further studies in Lake Barrancs and other lakes from the Maladeta massif are necessary to validate the hypotheses presented here concerning the response of glacial and snow-melt activity to climate variability and the palaeoseismic record of the Central Pyrenees.

A and g(s) were measured during late summer on leaves of mature trees in in orchard subjected to the following fungicide programs: synthetic fungicides only; synthetic fungicides integrated with copper-based fungicides or not sprayed. Bronzing symptoms were observed on trees sprayed with copper. Regression analysis revealed that neither A nor g(s) decreased its leaf surface area affected by bronzing increased (R-2 = 0.004. P = 0.80 and R-2 = 0.006, P = 0.74, respectively) bronzing associated with application of copper-based fungicides may therefore be inconsequential to foliar gas exchange in tart cherry during title summer.

Water samples were collected from eight different sampling stations from the eastern, western, northern and southern sides of the lake. The study has revealed that the coliform bacteria are increased (24000/mL) at the onset of summer and are dropped to a minimum (120/mL) during monsoon season against the permissible limit of 100/mL recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for water to be used for drinking purposes. The data collected show that the water quality of the Upper lake is deteriorated and is gradually becoming unfit for drinking.

Whereas one form of radiation adaptive radiation has been studied extensively, another form non-adaptive radiation is discussed controversially and is poorly understood. In fact, the concept of non-adaptive radiation (i.e., rapid diversification of species not accompanied by adaptation into various niches and resulting in a group of allopatric taxa) is rejected by some workers. Therefore, the present paper aims to review patterns and processes of radiation(s) in a model taxon - the stenoecious spring snail genus Bythinella - within the theoretical framework of adaptive versus non-adaptive radiations. Based on a taxon-wide phylogeny, several methods for identifying radiations are applied, including a new pragmatic approach based on the species flock concept and a temporal frame of rapid speciation. Then, the criteria of non-adaptive radiations are assessed and the driving forces discussed both in general and specifically for Bythinella spp. Based on eight identified radiations as well as ecological, morphological, and distribution data for up to 50 species, the presence of non-adaptive radiations is suggested in this taxon. Driving forces for these radiations might be genetic drift in small sub-divided populations, though natural selection may be involved as well. Moreover, it is shown that adaptive and non-adaptive radiations might not be entirely discrete in space and time. The present study underlines the need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of adaptive and non-adaptive radiations and for a judicious use of these epithets.

The aim of this study was to analyse pikeperch rate of movement and to assess whether it displayed a diel pattern related to temperature. Thus acoustic telemetry was used to track adult pikeperch in a drainage canal located in south of France. The survey was carried out in spring, during the spawning period. The results showed that females were more active than males. This is in accordance with previous data on the nest guardian behaviour of the males. For both genders, the activity rates increased during the study period as water temperature rose. Males and females displayed the same diel activity with a maximum at dusk, thereby confirming many indirect observations. Nevertheless, inter-individuals variations were observed. Thus, these results on diel activity are rather a general trend than a strict rule and suggest the involvement of other factors than light intensity in the control of diel activity. This diel rhythm is positively correlated to water temperature for females. Pikeperch activity may be the result of a trade-off between physiological requirements of temperature and light, satisfaction of energy needs and avoidance of predators.

Just after the thaw, succeeding to algal growth under the ice cover, the detritivorous Filinia hofmanni developed in the deep layers. It was followed by the herbivoro-detritivorous Keratella quadrata at 1 m and 7 m. With Spring increase the algae Polyarthra remata reached in the surface layers, followed by the dominant species Keratella cochlearis at the same depths, this herbivoro-detritivorous species was eaten by Asplanchna priodonta which peaked after. An other herbivoro-detritivorous species Kellicottia longispina succeeded in abundance at 7 m depth, followed by the detritivorous Conochilus unicornis before building up a second generation.																			0003-4339						1990	11	3					113	121																WOS:A1990EQ03500001

Olusola; Mindrescu, Marcel; Begy, Robert; Feurdean, Angelica			Recent sediment accumulation rates in contrasting lakes in the Carpathians (Romania): impacts of shifts in socio-economic regime	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Longer-term environmental studies are increasingly used to better understand contemporary ecosystems conditions and for forecasting their future trajectories. Here, we use radiometric measurements and the characterisation of sediment properties from six mountain and a lowland lake in Central Eastern Europe with the aim to assess temporal and spatial variability in sediment accumulation rates (SARs) in relation to three socio-economic regimes: traditional (1840-1948), socialist (1948-1989) and post-socialist (post-1990). We also set out to determine reference conditions for these lakes i.e. conditions before significant human impact. Our results show a trend of increasing SARs from basal sediments (pre 1840) towards the present at only two sites. This contrasts with findings from Western and Central European lakes where SARs have predominantly increased from 1850 towards the top of cores. We highlight the differential impacts of the traditional, socialist and post-socialist periods on the SARs at these lakes. Lowland and mid-elevations lakes (n = 2) were most markedly impacted by the socialist period of land use regime; lakes from the southern Carpathians (n = 2) were more impacted in the traditional period (transhumance pastoral activities), whereas those from the north (n = 3) in the socialist and post-socialist periods (summer pastoralism). Results from our study show a continuous anthropogenic impact during the entire period considered, even in remote mountain areas. This suggests that a temporal frame of 100-150 years is too short to meaningfully register the reference conditions of these lakes. Furthermore, a predominantly natural state may not have existed for centuries in this region.					; Mindrescu, Marcel/IVV-5754-2023; Hutchinson, Simon/D-2766-2015	Feurdean, Angelica/0000-0002-2497-3005; Hutchinson, Simon/0000-0003-0072-1062													1436-3798	1436-378X				FEB	2016	16	2			SI		501	513		10.1007/s10113-015-0764-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0764-7													WOS:000369005400018
J	MONGILLO, MA				MONGILLO, MA			AERIAL THERMAL INFRARED MAPPING OF THE WAIMANGU-WAIOTAPU GEOTHERMAL REGION, NEW-ZEALAND	GEOTHERMICS												A GEOSCAN MkII aerial multispectral scanner was used to acquire nighttime thermal infrared (TIR) imagery over an area extending from southern Lake Tarawera to northern Reporoa as part of a surface geothermal feature mapping and monitoring project. This data, which covers a 100 km(2) area at a ground spatial resolution of about 3 m, was obtained in six contiguous channels spanning the wavelength range 8.4-11.6 mu m. Results from the preliminary analysis of band 20 (9.17 mu m) are presented here. All known major geothermal features, which include hot springs and streams, hot ground and thermal seeps into lakes, were detected and accurately mapped on imagery rectified to the New Zealand Map Grid. In addition, several previously unreported thermal features were identified. The imagery clearly showed that the abundant surface activity at Waiotapu occurs along lineations, convincing evidence of structural control of permeability. A large hot spring, which has appeared on the north shore of Frying Pan Lake (Waimangu) since the last lake survey, was identified, demonstrating the usefulness of the TIR method for monitoring temporal changes in surface manifestations. Surface temperatures were estimated from empirically calibrated imagery and results for two Waimangu thermal crater lakes agree with measured values to within 1-2 degrees C.																			0375-6505					OCT-DEC	1994	23	5-6					511	526		10.1016/0375-6505(94)90016-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0375-6505(94)90016-7													WOS:A1994QG37600009

The results show that the area was covered with deciduous broadleaved forest dominated by deciduous Quercus between 15.8 and 12.8 cal kyr BP, suggesting slightly cold and dry conditions. From 12.8 to 83 cal kyr BP, the vegetation continued to be dominated by deciduous broadleaved forest, but there was also a sudden increase in Castanopsis/Lithocarpus and a slight drop in deciduous Quercus and Alnus, reflecting a gradual increase in both temperature and humidity. During the period 8.3-4.6 cal kyr BP, the mixed deciduous forests became more diverse and dense, with thermophilous and hygrophilous species expanding to their maximum extents, implying a warm and rather humid climate. From 4.6 to 0.5 cal kyr BP, the vegetation was succeeded by open mixed deciduous forest dominated by Alnus, with a retreating evergreen broadleaved forest, indicating a cool and slightly dry climate. After 0.5 cal kyr BP, the vegetation became less diverse and more open, but evergreen broadleaved trees increased their spread markedly, suggesting that the climate had become warmer and drier. In recent decades, human activity resulted in a large increase in Alnus and Pinus around this lake basin. Specifically, we concluded that the warm and moist climate detected between 83 and 4.6 cal kyr BP may have occurred in response to the high sea surface temperatures and high sea levels in the Bay of Bengal existent at that time.

The proportion of water column phosphorus reaching sediment traps showed a seasonal component with a minimum during late summer. Biogenic silicon analysis indicated that relatively high rates of phosphorus removal were associated with the sedimentation of siliceous algae ( diatoms) from the water column. Estimates of the impact of nutrient removal through diatom sedimentation indicate that this process can reduce primary production by decreasing the amount of nutrient remineralization in the water column during the stratified period.																			0168-2563					AUG	2003	65	1					1	13		10.1023/A:1026087808168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026087808168													WOS:000185795900001

The RSL data suggest an initial ice retreat between c. 15,370 and 12,660 cal yr B.P. Within this period, meltwater pulse IA (mwp IA, between c. 14,600-14,200 and 14,100-13,700 cal yr B.P.) occurred; an exceptionally large ice melting event, inferred from far-field sea-level records. The RSL curve shows a pronounced highstand of approximately 8 m between c. 7570-7270 and 7250-6950 cal yr B.P. that is consistent with the timing of the RSL highstand in the nearby Vestfold Hills. This is followed by a fall in RSL to the present. In contrast to previous findings, the isolation of the lakes in the Larsemann Hills postdates the isolation of lakes with similar sill heights in the Vestfold Hills. An increase in RSL fall during the late Holocene may record a decline in the rate of isostatic uplift in the Larsemann Hills between c. 7250-6950 and 2847-2509 cal yr B.P., that occurred in response to a documented mid-Holocene glacier readvance followed by a late-Holocene retreat.

Epibionts are suctorian ciliate protozoan species Acineta satyanandani and Paracineta karunakarani. Epibionts colonized the entire body surface,but were most numerous Oh the dorsal. region of the carapace. Maximum number of epibionts was found on females, when compared to the male organisms. Live ostracod specimens infested with epibionts were less active than the uninfested ones and these results further suggest that epibiontic protozoans may also influence the activity of ostracods and therefore may play a substantial role in ostracod production and community dynamics.

El Olivar and Laguna de Agua Caliente, in the southern part of the Sula graben are very close to a Quaternary basaltic field, whereas Azacualpa "La Cueva", Rio Ulua and Rio Gualcarque, located to the southwest of the Yojoa Lake, direcly emerge from the Cretaceous limestone deposits. The measured temperatures range between 37.5 and 104.8 degrees C. "Mature", alkaline, Na-SO4 thermal waters discharge from Azacualpa "La Cueva", while those from El Olivar and Laguna de Agua Caliente are "immature" and show a Na-HCO3 composition. Chemical equilibria of waters and gases from the Azacualpa "La Cueva" thermal springs indicate temperatures ranging from 150 to 200 degrees C Conversely, gas discharges from El Olivar and Laguna de Agua Caliente have attained a partial chemical equilibrium in the liquid phase at slightly higher temperatures (200-250 degrees C), although gas-gas faster reactions involving CO seem to be adjusted in an isothermally separated vapor phase. Unlike Azacualpa, SiO2 geothermometer at El Olivar and Laguna de Agua Caliente indicates equilibrium temperatures for the liquid phase much lower than those calculated for the gas phase (<= 120 degrees C). We conclude that thermal waters from the Azacualpa area likely represent the direct emergence of a water dominated reservoir having temperatures <= 1.150-200 degrees C. By contrast, at El Olivar and Laguna de Agua Caliente hot springs are supplied by a boiling shallow aquifer fed by a vapor phase rising from a steam-dominated zone. The above geochemical model is consistent with a geothermal reservoir hosted within the Cretaceous carbonate sequences of the Yojoa Group in the whole investigated sites. The reservoir extensively crops out in the Azacualpa area whereas the geothermal sites of the southern Sula graben (Laguna de Agua Caliente and El Olivar) are covered by the Oligocene-Miocene volcano-sedimentary sequences of the Matagalpa formation, possibly acting as efficient impermeable cap rocks. These results significantly differ from those reported by previous studies and emphasize that the southern Sula graben, in particular the El Olivar area, can represent among the investigated thermal springs, the most promising site for the exploitation of a high-enthalpy geothermal field.

One of the lakes is a clear-water seepage lake situated in sandy terrain with minimal wetland influence. The other is a dark-water lake receiving channelized inputs from a relatively large terrestrial wetland. Methyl mercury (MeHg) accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnia of both lakes during summer stratification, reaching concentrations of 0.8 ng center dot L-1 in the clear-water lake and 5 ng center dot L-1 in the dark-water lake. The stable isotopic assays indicated that rate constants of Hg-(II) methylation (K-m) ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 center dot day(-1) in the clear-water lake and from 0.01 to 0.09 center dot day(-1) in the dark-water lake, depending on the depth stratum. On average, K-m was threefold greater in the dark-water lake. Hypolimnetic demethylation rate constants (K-dm) averaged 0.03 center dot day(-1) in the clear-water lake and 0.05 center dot day(-1) in the dark-water lake. These methylation rates were sufficient to account for the observed accumulation of MeHg in hypolimnetic water during summer in both lakes. Despite substantial export of MeHg from the wetland to the dark-water lake, our study indicates that in-lake production and decomposition of MeHg dominated the MeHg cycle in both lakes.					; Hintelmann, Holger/AEV-0466-2022; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011	Hintelmann, Holger/0000-0002-5287-483X; Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2005	62	2					400	411		10.1139/F04-205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-205													WOS:000228083800015

The deposit is on the northern end of the Eureka Mining District, which supported underground and open pit mining from 1896 to 1994. The district has produced over 3 million ounces of gold, primarily from underground mining at Republic, Knob Hill, and Golden Promise. Additional production came from small open pit operations at Mud Lake, Mountain Lion, and Trevitt-Pierce, all of which are on or proximal to Golden Eagle. Historic production focused on gold-silver bearing quartz veins that cut Sanpoil volcanics. The Eocene Sanpoil Formation is a volcanic unit comprised of a lower zone of massive andesite flows, overlain by volcaniclastics and pyroclastic air fall deposits. This unit is the primary ore host at Golden Eagle. Overlying this is the Klondike Mountain Formation, which is a series of post-mineral conglomerates, sandstones, and lacustrine siltstones. Only minor 'placer type' gold mineralization is found in the base of the Klondike, within gravels containing eroded clasts of the orebody. The Sanpoil and Klondike are cross cut by Tertiary trachandesite dikes, which are distinctly post-mineral. The Sanpoil is also cross-cut by Scatter Creek rhyodacite dikes of Tertiary age, which appear to be older then the trachandesite dikes. Mineralization and the dikes are both offset by late-stage extensional faulting associated with the Republic Graben, and covered by 0-300 feet (0-90 m) of glacial till. The Golden Eagle gold deposit is the upper level expression of an epithermal hot springs system. Gold mineralization is primarily in moderate to highly silicified breccias beneath a sinter hot springs cap. The deposit is underlain and bracketed by high grade gold-silver bearing quartz veins, which were exploited by the Knob Hill and Mountain Lion workings. There is exploration potential for additional high grade veins, as evidenced by exploration drill intercepts up to 4 ozAu/st (137 g/t) and 20 ozAg/st (686 g/t) within the deposit footprint. Santa Fe Pacific Gold acquired a 75 percent stake in the property in 1996 and defined a resource of 32.19 Mt grading 0.069 ozAu/st (2.37 g/t) (2.22 Moz gold contained). SFPG was working on a prefeasibility study, when it merged with Newmont Mining Corporation. The property was then sold to Echo Bay Mines, which merged with Kinross Gold Corporation. In 2008, Midway Gold Corp purchased the private property and associated mineral rights from Kinross and Hecla Mining Company for $1.98 million. Midway Gold Corp updated this resource (prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 standards) and in August 2009 released an indicated gold resource of 27.6 Mt grading 0.061 (2.09 g/t) (1.545 Moz gold contained). The orebody is primarily disseminated gold associated with arsenic rich rims on framboidal pyrite, with gold values ranging from 0 to 0.25 ozAu/st (0-8.57 g/t). Sulfide content averages 3 percent, with successful extraction demonstrated through bioleaching, flotation and autoclave methods.

J	Ryan, EF; Hamilton, DP				Ryan, EF; Hamilton, DP			Recent occurrence of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in Waikato Lakes of New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a toxin-producing species of cyanobacteria that in autumn 2003 was recorded for the first time in three shallow (max. depth less than or equal to5 m) Waikato lakes and a hydro-electric dam on the Waikato River, New Zealand. It formed water blooms at densities >100 000 cells/ml in Lakes Waahi and Whangape. Net rates of population growth >0.2 day(-1) were recorded for C raciborskii in Lakes Ngaroto, Waahi, and Karapiro, based on comparisons of low numbers (detection of <10 cells/ml) from initial samples and its presence at bloom densities (>15 000 cells/ml) in the subsequent sample "x"-"y" days later. C. raciborskii may be well adapted to rapid proliferation in the Waikato lakes, which are eutrophic to hypertrophic, with high light attenuation, and where nitrogen (N) fixation may provide it with a competitive advantage over non-nitrogen fixing algae under N-limited conditions.

Eastern Beringia and beyond: Late Wisconsinan and Holocene landscape dynamics along the Yukon Coastal Plain, Canada	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Terrestrial permafrost archives along the Yukon Coastal Plain (northwest Canada) have recorded landscape development and environmental change since the Late Wisconsinan at the interface of unglaciated Beringia (i.e. Komakuk Beach) and the northwestern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (i.e. Herschel Island). The objective of this paper is to compare the late glacial and Holocene landscape development on both sides of the former ice margin based on permafrost sequences and ground ice. Analyses at these sites involved a multi-proxy approach including: sedimentology, cryostratigraphy, palaeoecology of ostracods, stable water isotopes in ground ice, hydrochemistry. and AMS radiocarbon and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating. AMS and IRSL age determinations yielded full glacial ages at Komakuk Beach that is the northeastern limit of ice-free Beringia. Herschel Island to the east marks the Late Wisconsinan limit of the northwest Laurentide Ice Sheet and is composed of ice-thrust sediments containing plant detritus as young as 16.2 cal ka BP that might provide a maximum age on ice arrival. Late Wisconsinan ice wedges with sediment-rich fillings on Herschel Island are depleted in heavy oxygen isotopes (mean delta O-18 of -29.1 parts per thousand); this, together with low d-excess values, indicates colder-than-modern winter temperatures and probably reduced snow depths. Grain-size distribution and fossil ostracod assemblages indicate that deglaciation of the Herschel Island ice-thrust moraine was accompanied by alluvial, proluvial. and eolian sedimentation on the adjacent unglaciated Yukon Coastal Plain until similar to 11 cal ka BP during a period of low glacio-eustatic sea level. The late glacial-Holocene transition was marked by higher-than-modern summer temperatures leading to permafrost degradation that began no later than 11.2 cal ka BP and caused a regional thaw unconformity. Cryostructures and ice wedges were truncated while organic matter was incorporated and soluble ions were leached in the thaw zone. Thermokarst activity led to the formation of ice-wedge casts and deposition of thermokarst lake sediments. These were subsequently covered by rapidly accumulating peat during the early Holocene Thermal Maximum. A rising permafrost table. reduced peat accumulation, and extensive ice-wedge growth resulted from climate cooling starting in the middle Holocene until the late 20th century. The reconstruction of palaeolandscape dynamics on the Yukon Coastal Plain and the eastern Beringian edge contributes to unraveling the linkages between ice sheet. ocean, and permafrost that have existed since the Late Wisconsinan.

The records indicate distinct sedimentological signatures over the two time periods, which likely reflect a modification of the main detrital provenance during the LIG compared to the Holocene. Here we postulate that the observed differences in the terrigenous supply during the LIG relative to the Holocene reflect a northeast migration of the main precipitation belt over the Mississippi River watershed likely in response to deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet prior to the peak in boreal summer insolation and the overall greater increase in boreal summer insolation relative to the Holocene. These combined effects allowed more northward migration of the Jet Stream, Atlantic Warm Pool and Intertropical Convergence Zone than during the Holocene, which may have also forced the Bermuda High farther to the northeast of its present position, thereby pumping more moisture from the GoM and the Caribbean region into both the Upper Mississippi River and northeast Great Lakes area.

A Link Between Hydroclimate Variability and Biomass Burning During the Last Millennium in the Interior Pacific Northwest	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We present oxygen isotope and charcoal accumulation records from two lakes in eastern Washington that have sufficient temporal resolution to quantitatively compare with tree-ring records and meteorological data. Hydroclimate reconstructions from tree-rings and lake sediments show close correspondence after accounting for seasonal- to centennial- scale temporal sensitivities. Carbonate delta 18O measurements from Castor and Round lakes reveal that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) experienced wetter November-March conditions than the Little Ice Age (LIA). Charcoal records from Castor, Round, and nearby lakes show elevated fire activity during the LIA compared to the MCA. Increased multidecadal hydroclimate variability after 1250 CE is evident in proxy records throughout western North America. In the Upper Columbia River Basin, multidecadal wet periods during the LIA may have enhanced fuel loads that burned in subsequent dry periods. A notable decline in biomass burning occurred with Euro-American settlement in the late nineteenth century. Paleoclimate reconstructions are based on proxy records that are sensitive to particular aspects of the climate system. We compare high-resolution lake sediment records with nearby tree-ring chronologies and instrumental data to explore hypotheses about climate variability. Here, we confirm that lake-sediment oxygen isotope ratios in the Upper Columbia River Basin are primarily sensitive to cool-season precipitation, whereas many tree-ring records are primarily sensitive to warm-season conditions. When lake records are compared with winter-sensitive tree-ring width chronologies, the reconstructions are similar. Oxygen isotopes indicate wet and stable winter conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (900-1250 CE) and variable but generally dry conditions during the Little Ice Age (1450-1850 CE). Wet periods of fuel buildup, followed by drought, may have driven greater fire activity during the LIA. An abrupt decline in fire begins occurred Euro-American settlement, after the 1850s, and is attributed to loss of fuel connectivity and less ignition.

WEATHER AND PREY AVAILABILITY AFFECT THE TIMING OF FALL MIGRATION OF EARED GREBES (PODICEPS NIGRICOLLIS) FROM GREAT SALT LAKE	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Great Salt Lake (GSL) is a critical migratory stopover location for Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), but the factors influencing the timing of their fall migration have not previously been investigated. We used archived Doppler radar data to visualize the nocturnal departures of Eared Grebes from GSL over 16 years, from 1999-2015. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine interannual variability in the timing of migration of Eared Grebes in relation to prey availability and lake temperature, as well as variation in the nightly departure likelihoods of Eared Grebes in relation to weather. On average, Eared Grebes departed from GSL over a period of 31 days each year, with departures occurring on 17 of those days. We did not find any trend toward earlier departures over the years of the study. Departures typically began earlier in the year when densities of brine shrimp adults (Artemia franciscana) were higher than average, densities of brine shrimp cysts were lower than average, and lake temperatures were warmer than average. The span of migration departures was most strongly related to the day of first departure, with longer spans occurring in years with an earlier migration initiation day. We also found that likelihood of departure from GSL was greater on nights with high barometric pressure and low lake temperature. High barometric pressure was related to low wind speeds and low incidence of precipitation. We concluded that Eared Grebes depart when they have gained sufficient mass to successfully migrate rather than lingering at GSL for as long as possible, and that migration departure is most likely on nights with fair weather.

Grain-size analysis of suspended sediment load in modern rivers draining into the lake and of moraine material from the northern part of the catchment shows that the silt fraction is transported to the central part of the lake mainly by river suspension, whereas the clay fraction is mainly transported by glacial meltwater during deglaciation. The changes in of the clay/silt ratio in Lake Khubsugul sediments correlates well with the standard global paleoclimate records: low clay/silt ratios indicate warm climates, while a high clay/silt ratio reflects glacial erosion and cold climates. Pulses of clay input into the lake occur at the final stages of glacial periods (i.e., glacial maxima and subsequent onsets of deglaciation). The periodicity in glacial clay input in Lake Khubsugul is in tune with global periods of deglaciation, but there are differences in the intensity of the deglacial events for MIS-12 and MIS-2. These differences are attributed to specific conditions in regional distribution of moisture during glaciation, glacial ice volumes, and solar insolation intensity at the onset of deglaciation. Deglaciation of the Khubsugul glaciers occurred in response to an increase in summer solar insolation above a threshold value of 490 W/m(2). Two types of deglaciation can be distinguished: (1) slow melting during several tens of 1,000 years during weak increases in summer insolation, and (2) short and fast melting during several thousands of years in response to strong increases in summer insolation. The maximum ice volume in the area of Lake Khubsugul during the past 450 ka occurred during the period of 373-350 ka BP (MIS 11a-10) and was caused by high levels of moisture in the region, whereas the MIS-2 and MIS-12 glacial periods were characterized by minima in ice volume, due to the strong aridity in the region.

SPATIAL VARIATION OF WITHIN-DAY AND BETWEEN-DAY CHLOROPHYLL A DYNAMICS DURING SUMMER IN GUANTING RESERVOIR, BEIJING, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Recognizing intra- and inter-daily dynamics of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and its related environmental variables on consecutive days is essential to assessing and managing water quality and eutrophication. In this study, the Chl-a concentration, nutrients, water temperature and meteorological factors in Guanting Reservoir in Beijing were collected at six sampling times during summer. The Chl-a concentration generally decreased from May to September. At both test times, thermal stratification and mixing in the water column controlled temporal and vertical variations in the maximum Chl-a concentration layer. The position of the maximum Chl-a concentration layer between days generally followed that of the thermocline. Daily stratifications were temporary and downwelling variations in the maximum Chl-a concentration layer were wind driven; therefore, the vertical distribution of Chl-a was homogenized at night. Surface Chl-a concentrations increased at night and decreased during the day, except on rainy days. Principal component analysis and Pearson's correlations indicated that daily average and raw surface Chl-a concentrations generally changed as a negative function of air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and water temperature. However, when a 5-hour time lag was considered, the relationship between surface Chl-a concentration, all meteorological factors and water temperature became significantly positive.					li, xuedong/JYP-4367-2024	Nakamura, Takashi/0000-0003-3069-8879													1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	3					5765	5780		10.15666/aeer/1703_57655780	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1703_57655780													WOS:000469124600027

The array permits a detailed study of cosmic ray energy spectrum and mass composition in the energy range 10(16)-10(18) eV with a uniform method. We describe the array construction, DAQ and methods of the array calibration. The method of energy reconstruction and absolute calibration of measurements are discussed. The analysis of spatial and time structure of EAS Cherenkov light allows to estimate the depth of the EAS maximum X-max. The results on the all particles energy spectrum and the mean depth of the EAS maximum X-max vs. primary energy derived from the data of two winter seasons (2009-2011) are presented. Preliminary results of joint operation of the Cherenkov array with antennas for the detection of EAS radio signals are shown.

C and the length of the ice-freez season has increased by 3 weeks. Higher than normal evaporation and lower than average precipitation have decreased rates of water renewal in lakes. Concentrations of most chemicals have increased in both lakes and streams because of decreased water renewal and forest fires in the catchments. In Lake 239, populations and diversity of phytoplankton also increased, but primary production showed no consistent trend. Increased wind velocities, increased transparency, and increased exposure to wind of lakes in burned catchments caused thermoclines to deepen. As a result, summer habitats for cold stenothermic organisms like lake trout and opposum shrimp decreased. Our observations may provide a preview of the effects of increased greenhouse warming on boreal lakes.

Success of Walleye stocking events vary; thus, evaluating the external factors that influence recruitment success of Walleye resulting from stocking or natural production is critical for improved management.Methods We evaluated factors influencing the relative recruitment in 98 lakes stocked annually with Walleye by integrating 20 years of stocking data with fisheries assessment and abiotic data. We indexed recruitment as the relative abundance of Walleye cohorts from natural and stocked sources combined and used boosted regression tree modeling to identify variables that are associated with varying recruitment.Result Growing degree-days at age 1, shoreline development index, mean depth, and degree-days at age 2 were the most important variables. The boosted regression tree model explained 17% of observed variability in recruitment. A positive relationship between growing degree-days and Walleye recruitment was observed, whereas shoreline development and lake depth had a negative relationship with recruitment. Secondarily important predictors were lake surface area, spring warming rate, Northern Pike Esox lucius abundance, and degree-days at age 0. In general, Walleye recruitment was positively associated with these predictors, with the exceptions of spring warming rates >0.3degree celsius/day and being exposed to >3500 degree-days at age 0.Conclusion Our results indicate that thermal variables in addition to lake characteristics are important recruitment drivers in stocked waters and highlights the potential for resource managers to use this information to prioritize stocking efforts in temperate lakes.

The analysis concentrates mainly on the temperature structure in the convectively mixed region and the dynamics of a special thermo-hydrodynamic phenomenon called ''thermal bar'' (a zone of descending water with the temperature of maximum density equal to approximately 4-degrees-C). A theoretical model of the temperature distribution in the convectively mixed region (temperatures <4-degrees-C) and the thermal bar progression is also applied and compared with satellite data. The study shows that the temperature offshore the 4-degrees-C isotherm in the convectively mixed region of the lake is almost depth-constant because of strong convective mixing and that the horizontal heat flux seems to be of minor importance in this region. The comparison between predictions from the simple theoretical model describing the temperature evolution and movement of the thermal bar with observations showed a fairly good agreement. However, calculations of the change of heat content in water columns along sections indicate heat transport from the nearshore, stably stratified region toward the 4-degrees-C isotherm which will affect the movement of the thermal bar. This effect has been incorporated in an improved model of the thermal bar progression. A better agreement between predictions and observations was also obtained with this model.

In the Salt Lake City, Utah, metropolitan area, recurring traffic congestion (i.e., peak commute times) and nonrecurring congestion (weather related) result in an estimated average annual cost of $449 million. Recent Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) studies have confirmed that inclement weather plays a significant role in nonrecurring congestion and associated negative impacts. In an effort to measure and potentially mitigate weather-related traffic congestion, a cooperative research study between academic (University of Utah), state [Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)], federal (National Weather Service), and private sector (Weathernet) entities was undertaken. Driver awareness surveys were conducted for two significant winter storms along the Wasatch Front urban corridor. Participants typically used media and personal sources for gathering weather and road information, with government sources (UDOT and NWS) used less frequently. Use of government and personal sources were significant predictors of behavior change. Satisfaction with all information sources was high. The most frequent commuting changes reported were route changes and shifts in travel schedule, especially leaving early to avoid the storm. Self-reported actions from interviewees were supported by measured changes in speed, flow, and travel time from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) utilized by UDOT. The long-term goal is to use these results to provide insight into how the weather enterprise might more effectively communicate hazard information to the public in a manner that leads to improved response (change travel times, modes, etc.).																			1948-8327	1948-8335				OCT	2016	8	4					475	491		10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0017.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0017.1													WOS:000389130500013

Mining-Related Sediment and Soil Contamination in a Large Superfund Site: Characterization, Habitat Implications, and Remediation	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Historical mining activity (1850-1970) in the now inactive Tri-State Mining District provided an ongoing source of lead and zinc to the environment including the US Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site located in Cherokee County, southeast Kansas, USA. The resultant contamination adversely affected biota and caused human health problems and risks. Remediation in the Superfund site requires an understanding of the magnitude and extent of contamination. To provide some of the required information, a series of sediment and soil investigations were conducted in and near the Superfund site to characterize lead and zinc contamination in the aquatic and floodplain environments along the main-stem Spring River and its major tributaries. In the Superfund site, the most pronounced lead and zinc contamination, with concentrations that far exceed sediment quality guidelines associated with potential adverse biological effects, was measured for streambed sediments and floodplain soils located within or downstream from the most intensive mining-affected areas. Tributary streambeds and floodplains in affected areas are heavily contaminated with some sites having lead and zinc concentrations that are an order of magnitude (or more) greater than the sediment quality guidelines. For the main-stem Spring River, the streambed is contaminated but the floodplain is mostly uncontaminated. Measured lead and zinc concentrations in streambed sediments, lakebed sediments, and floodplain soils documented a persistence of the post-mining contamination on a decadal timescale. These results provide a basis for the prioritization, development, and implementation of plans to remediate contamination in the affected aquatic and floodplain environments within the Superfund site.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2016	58	4					721	740		10.1007/s00267-016-0729-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0729-8								27357805					WOS:000384420900012

Using basal areas obtained from temporary plots and seedbed distributions from field data, seedling densities are simulated for pure Picea mariana (Mill.) and Pinus banksiana (Lamb.) stands under burned intact, and traditional first winter and delayed salvage scenarios. These stands are grouped by age-class, pre-fire stand cover, surficial deposit, and drainage. Following this classification scheme, simulated seedling densities are transferred onto forest inventory maps for the Lake Matagami lowland ecological region (6a) in the boreal forest of Quebec (used as a case study to illustrate the potential of the tool). The final output of the model is an estimate of seedlings/m(2) following moderate to severe fire, and fire followed by 100% salvage in pure P. mariana and P. banksiana stands, however it is also capable of simulating partial salvage. Results are expressed as seedlings/ha, and illustrate that in our study area, only 35% of intact P. mariana and 6% of intact P. banksiana stands need to be planted following fire; however under the traditional 100% first winter salvage scenario, 100% of P. mariana and 74% of P. banksiana stands necessitate planting. If salvage logging is delayed until the second, third, or fourth winter following fire, planting will be required in 98%, 88%, and 66% of P. mariana, and 65%, 56%, and 56% of P. banksiana stands respectively. This type of tool allows managers and foresters to quickly assess reforestation needs following fire and salvage at the landscape level, and can be used to better plan the timing and location of salvage operations and subsequent silvicultural treatment application. In addition to being able to schedule operations faster, foresters will also be able to quickly identify regions where natural regeneration could be inadequate or excessive. Potential cost estimates of future interventions such as planting, aerial seeding, and pre-commercial thinning could be made. Foresters can also assess the current vulnerability of management units to fire and can identify regions at particular risk. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These sediments, called the Wozniki Limestone, form a SE-NW-striking elongate (90 km) and narrow (<10 km) belt. The Wozniki Limestone overlies (mostly discordantly) Carnian gypsiferous red beds and underlies the uppermost Triassic-Lower Jurassic continental clastic deposits. Laterally, the carbonates are replaced by a typically red bed clastic assemblage formed under arid and semiarid climatic conditions. Several limestone types have been recognized within the freshwater facies, including travertines, and fluvial, palustrine and pedogenic carbonates. Palustrine limestones form a major component. Common tepee structures, karst breccia, silicified horizons, and weathering breccia indicate that the palustrine carbonates have undergone subaerial exposition and pedogenic alteration. Palustrine carbonate sedimentation has been interrupted and replaced by fluvial sedimentation. The fluvial sediments mark the pluvial climate episodes that inhibited carbonate deposition. The studied basin displays a striking scarcity of lacustrine sediments, which may be explained in terms of hydrological and climatic controls. We infer that the carbonates were deposited within shallow swampy depressions, fed by springs of deep-circulating groundwater, partly of hydrothermal nature, under dry and semidry paleoclimatic conditions in a fault-bounded basin. The travertines precipitated directly near the springs, whereas the remnant solutions formed a broad swamp area where palustrine carbonates formed. It seems very likely that the carbonate-bearing solutions were causally related to the hydrothermal karst that occurs within the Triassic and Paleozoic basement limestones.

However, the chronology of its development has so far not been studied in detail. Since the ancient lagoon is dominated by sand deposition, optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL) was used to determine when the ancient coast was formed. Twenty-one OSL samples gave a wide age range, between 8.57 +/- 0.65 ka and 73.8 +/- 8.3 ka. Twelve of the ages fall in the Late Glacial and Holocene and document the devel-opment of the lagoon between the Baltic Ice Lake stage (-16 ka) and the Littorina Sea stage (-8 ka). The new dates correspond to some extent with previously modelled shorelines for the Ventspils Lagoon and to radiocarbon ages from archaeological sites in the area. One date, 16.0 +/- 1.3 ka, falls in the period before the Baltic Ice Lake and represents either a very early Baltic Ice Lake stage or, less likely, the Venta glacial lake prior to the Baltic Ice Lake. One date, 5.09 +/- 0.42, is likely underestimated. Seven samples yielded dates between 21.5 +/- 1.5 ka and 73.8 +/- 8.3 ka, which corresponds to the Early and Middle Weichselian in the Baltic region. The samples in this latter group are likely overestimating the true age due to insufficient exposure to sunlight during deposition.

Chlorophyll a concentration and pigment absorption spectra were obtained in these four compartments before and/or after the thawing of the ice cover. During the ice free period, carbon fixation and biomass was measured in the phytoplankton and in the benthic moss Campyliadelphus polygamus. From these measurements we conclude that the benthic moss is the most significant autotrophic component in this lake in terms of biomass, chlorophyll a content and primary productivity. The integral assimilation number (The ratio of carbon fixation per unit area to biomass per unit area) values were similar for both phytoplankton and the moss, ranging from 3.6 to 5.4 mg C (mg Chl a)-1 h-1 in phytoplankton and from 4.0 to 6.4 mg C (mg Chl a)-1 h-1 in the benthic moss. This approach allows comparisons of carbon fixation efficiency of the chlorophyll a under a unit area between compartments in their different light environments.																			0722-4060					OCT	1991	11	6					371	377																WOS:A1991GM04900003

From all these nutrients special attention is accorded to the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total phosphorus (TP). In this context, the aim of this paper was to determine the TOC, TN,and TP from the sediment and macrophytes samples from Horia Lake, Tulcea County, Romania. The lake is located in the area of Horia, being limited to the north, west, and south by the agricultural field. The slope of the ground allows the accumulation of the waters from the versants adjacent to the lake, with suspension contributions, fertilizers,and herbicides used for the adjacent corn crop. All the samples were collected in the autumn season (November 2016), from six stations of the lake. The results revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in the concentration of the TOC, TN, and the TP. Comparing the means values of these nutrients from macrophytes and sediments, it can be concluded that the higher values from macrophytes are the result of the assimilation capacity of these nutrients.

In this paper, we report the variations in the total dissolvable (TD), dissolved (D), and labile particulate (LP) fractions of Al, Si, P, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, W, and U in Lake Biwa 2007 and 2009. Al and Fe species were predominantly in the form of LP-Al and LP-Fe and were strongly correlated with one another (r = 0.99), suggesting that the weathering of aluminous minerals and the supply of clay mineral particles are the main factors that influence the distributions of Al and Fe. Although D-Al increased in the summer epilimnion, D-Fe was relatively low, probably as a result of uptake by plants. Reductive release of Fe from the bottom was not seen. Mn was also dominated by LP-Mn, but this fraction showed a different distribution to those of LP-Al and LP-Fe. The D-Mn and LP-Mn concentrations varied by factors of 700-1000 and showed marked increases in the bottom water during stratification in 2007. We believe that Mn2+ was released from the sediments and oxidized by DO in the bottom water. Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cr, which exist as cationic species, had LP/TD ratios of 0.1-0.7 and relatively uniform distributions. Si, P, V, As, Mo, W, and U, which form oxoacid species, had LP/TD ratios of 0-0.8. Si, P, and As were characterized by nutrient-like profiles, V, W, and U showed summer maxima in the epilimnion, and Mo had a uniform distribution. TD-Mo increased in the bottom water along with TD-Mn, while TD-V and TD-W showed significant decreases. These results are likely attributable to differences in the adsorption of these elements onto manganese oxides and iron hydroxides.

J	TOHTZ, J				TOHTZ, J			LAKE WHITEFISH DIET AND GROWTH AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF MYSIS-RELICTA TO FLATHEAD LAKE, MONTANA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Diet and growth were compared for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis caught before and after the recent introduction of Mysis relicta to Flathead Lake, Montana. Most foods and seasonal feeding patterns were similar, except that lake whitefish now also eat mysids. Mysids were eaten by fish larger than 100 mm total length, and especially by fish larger than 400 mm collected in the fall. Mean length at first annulus was less in most years following the mysid introduction than before (Student's t, P < 0.05). Mean lengths at other annuli were similar between the two periods. Larger lake whitefish may be less sensitive to reduced zooplankton abundance caused by mysid predation because they feed on benthic fauna. They may also benefit from the recent availability of mysids for their diet.																			0002-8487					JUL	1993	122	4					629	635		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0629:LWDAGA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0629:LWDAGA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LW05400011

Evaluation of green sorption media blanket filters for nitrogen removal in a stormwater retention basin at varying groundwater conditions in a karst environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Removing excess nutrient from stormwater runoffs is necessary to protect the water quality of receiving water bodies such as rivers, lakes, springs, and groundwater aquifers. Silver Springs Springshed, located in the vicinity of Ocala, Florida, has received widespread attention from the local government and residents due to its long-term nutrient impact, which has resulted in eutrophication. Blanket filters containing Bio-sorption Activated Media (BAM) were implemented with different depths of the vadose zone in a stormwater retention basin. The design combined the interaction with groundwater as an innovative Best Management Practice can potentially boost the performance of nutrient removal. Selected storm runoffs were collected at multiple points that cover the runoff timeframe to determine the pollutant load. Infiltrating water samples were collected at various depths within BAM using lysimeters to validate the treatment effectiveness. Significant pollutant load reduction of nutrients was confirmed with highest 99% and 91% removal of nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and total nitrogen (TN) at the deep blanket filter (with more groundwater intrusion impacts) due to more effective denitrification and longer contact time. Yet the highest pollutant load reduction of 93% and 84% removal of NOx and TN was also observed at the shallow blanket filter (with less groundwater intrusion impacts). On the other hand, better pollutant load reduction of ammonia in the BAM layer was found at the shallow blanket filter presumably due to more available oxygen for nitrification.

The history of the water-bodies in the Dead Sea basin commenced with the late Neogene transgression of the Sedom lagoon and was followed by the formation of several saline-to hypersaline lakes. The lakes comprise Ca-chloride brine that was initially formed by the Sedom lagoon. The brines migrated all over the Jordan Rift Valley and are expressed in the compositions of saline springs that are currently discharged into Lake Kinneret. The chapter presents a summary of the limnological history of the lake during the past 40 ka, as reflected in the sedimentary sequences that are exposed around the lake (e.g., Tel Bet -Yerach, Tel Qazir) and recovered from trenches and drilled cores (e.g., the Ohalo-II archaeological site). The lake reached its highest stand of similar to 160 m below mean sea level during the last glacial maximum (similar to 27-24 ka BP) and merged with Lake Lisan. At 24-23 ka BP, it declined below the modern level during the Heinrich (H2) event. Sr/Ca concentration and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios in modern lake waters and saline springs and in fossil Melanopsis shells and ostracods provide constraints on contributions of the fresh and saline waters to the lake during these high-and low-stand periods.

Rain and hail can reach the surface of Titan	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												We have calculated the condensation and evaporation of ternary CH4-N-2-C2H6 liquid drops and solid CH4 hail as they fall through Titan's lower atmosphere to determine the likelihood that precipitation reaches the ground. Assuming the humidity profile determined by the Huygens probe, binary liquid CH4/N-2 condensate grows in the region from similar to 8 to 15 km in Titan's atmosphere because the combined humidity of CH4 and N-2 exceeds saturation. These drops evaporate below similar to 8 km. We determine the fate of 10 mu m seeds composed of ethane, which is expected to provide condensation sites. In addition, we study the fate of already formed raindrops with radii of 1-4.75 mm falling out of the growth region. High (50%) and low (0%) ethane relative humidities (RH) are considered in the calculation. We find that drops with radii similar to 3 mm and smaller dropping from 8 km reach the ground in compositional equilibrium with the atmosphere in the high ethane RH case as a result of the stabilizing influence of the ethane, and evaporate in the atmosphere in the low ethane RH case. Large drops (> similar to 3 mm) reach the surface large and cold because the latent heat loss due to the evaporation of methane cools the drop and slows the evaporation rate. Pure methane hail hits the ground if its radius is initially more than 4 mm at 16 km above the surface and sublimates in the atmosphere if its radius is smaller. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jerrett, RM; Flint, SS; Brunt, RL				Jerrett, Rhodri M.; Flint, Stephen S.; Brunt, Rufus L.			Palaeovalleys in foreland ramp settings: what happens as accommodation decreases down dip?	BASIN RESEARCH												Recent advances in our understanding of palaeovalleys are largely guided by examples from passive margins, in which accommodation increases down depositional dip. This study tests these models against a dataset from the Pennsylvanian Breathitt Group of the central Appalachian foreland basin, USA. This fluvio-deltaic succession contains extensive erosionally based fluvio-estuarine sand bodies that can be tracked over 80 km down depositional dip from a proximal zone of high accommodation close to the orogenic margin to a distal, lower accommodation zone close to the cratonic margin of the basin. The sand bodies are up to 25 m thick, multi-storey and characterized in their lower parts by strongly amalgamated storeys containing sandy fluvial to estuarine bar accretion elements, and in their middle to upper parts by more fully preserved storeys up to 10 m thick and laterally extensive over 100s of metres. The upper storeys include abandonment channel-fills of heterolithic marine or marginal marine deposits or muddy to sandy point-bar elements. Three major regional-scale architectures include: (i) Tabular sand bodies that everywhere incise open marine prodelta and mouth bar facies and are interpreted as palaeovalleys formed during falling stage and lowstand systems tracts, when eustatic sea-level fall outpaced tectonic subsidence across the entire study area. (ii) Sand bodies that incise genetically related floodplain lake and/or bay-fill minor mouth bar deposits up depositional dip and open marine prodelta and mouth bar facies down dip. These stacked distributary channel deposits map down dip into palaeovalleys and formed when up dip subsidence rate resulted in positive, but reduced rate of accommodation creation, while lower tectonic subsidence rate down-dip resulted in incision. (iii) Sand bodies that incise genetically related floodplain, lake and/or bay-fill minor mouth bars up dip and pass down-dip into genetically related unconfined floodplain, prodelta and mouth bar deposits. These sand bodies represent stacked distributary channel fills and channel amalgamation was the product of high rates of lateral migration, typical of the behaviour of channels above their backwater reach. Case (2) sand bodies demonstrate that in rapidly subsiding foreland basins, cross-shelf palaeovalleys may form down depositional dip from aggradational, distributive fluival strata.

In the sea, they seemed to die within a short period of time. The fish appeared to be flushed downstream by autumn freshets. In age and size, but not sex, the descenders seem representative of the fish in the lake. Females were the predominant sex in the river, whereas the sex ratio did not differ from unity in the lake. Young fish were fast-growing, but the growth rate levelled off at an age of 2 years and an asymptotic length of .apprx. 30 cm. Males matured mainly at age 1 + and females at age 2+. The gonadosomatic index decreased with age, whereas the amount of energy allocated to gonadal tissue relative to somatic tissue increased with age.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				NOV	1988	23	3					197	204		10.1007/BF00004910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004910													WOS:A1988Q867800003

A multidisciplinary survey of these riverine lakes situated in large Wetland complexes was made comprising hydrological modelling, remote sensing and monitoring of water quality, plankton, aquatic vegetation and fish communities. Between-lake differences in water quality and aquatic vegetation cover were inferred from satellite image. Based on channel and lake dimensions, hydrological characteristics of the lakes in the delta were determined: hydrological distance from a riverbranch, residence time and impact of reed water. Water-quality and biotic parameters (phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish) were sampled in a comparative survey in June 1997-1999 in subsets of the lakes. In a follow-up study in 2001-2002, seasonality of aquatic vegetation and fish were recorded. A clear distinction was found in three lake types: (1) inflow lakes at short distance to the river, with a high flushing rate, high load of suspended minerals but low chlorophyll concentrations, high cover of floating and submerged vegetation and dominance of eurytopic fish; (2) large, relatively deep lakes with moderately long residence time, high Potamogeton-cover that collapses during summer, and dominated by eurytopic fish; (3) smaller, isolated lakes at the longest distance from the river, with long residence time, of which the water quality is strongly influenced by water flows through large floating reedbeds ('blackwater'), with a high vegetation cover of Ceratophyllum demersum and Nitellopsis obtusa throughout the summer and a limnophilic fish community tolerant for low oxygen conditions. Aquatic vegetation showed a clear seasonality related to the interaction between plant development and light conditions. Seasonal changes in fish distribution within the system merely followed the vegetation trends in different lakes and the conditions in the river channels. Past trends in the trophic gradient are discussed in the context of hydromorphological modifications in the Delta. There is a high potential for restoring natural processes owing to the high connectivity and large scale of the system. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Density of the zooplankton showed 1.1 to 3.2 fold differences between the less and more trophic areas. Density of the crustaceans, add up to the total density of rotifers and veligers. Net production of the primary consumers (filter-feeders and sedimentators) in the more trophic area exceeded 2 to 4 times of that in the less trophic area. In secondary consumer (predatory) level, such a difference had not been observed. The ratio between the net production of the primary and secondary consumers changed in the range of 4.7 to 5.9 and 14.5 to 30.3 in the less and the more trophic areas, respectively. Gross production of the zooplankton exceeded 8.5 to 9.1 and 5.1 to 5.9 times of the net production in the less and the more trophic areas, respectively. Biomass turnover time of the zooplankton was 8.41 and 7.79 days, in the less and the more trophic area, if net production was considered.

Importance of Accurately Quantifying Internal Loading in Developing Phosphorus Reduction Strategies for a Chain of Shallow Lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Robertson DM, Diebel MW. 2020. Importance of accurately quantifying internal loading in developing phosphorus reduction strategies for a chain of shallow lakes. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. The Winnebago Pool is a chain of 4 shallow lakes in Wisconsin. Because of high external phosphorus (P) inputs to the lakes, the lakes became highly eutrophic, with much P contained in their sediments. In developing a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for these lakes, it is important to determine how their phosphorus concentrations should respond to changes in external P loading. In many TMDLs, internal P loading is assumed to be negligible or it is estimated based on sediment release rates and dissolved oxygen conditions in the lake, and each lake is considered independently. To evaluate these assumptions, internal P loading and external P loading were quantified by developing detailed P budgets for the Winnebago Pool chain of lakes. This information was then inputted into 2 eutrophication models (BATHTUB and Jensen models), which were used to simulate the steady-state and transient effects of various P reduction strategies. The importance of internal P loading varied among lakes, from being a minor source to representing almost 60% of the summer P input. Model results indicate that each lake responds to external P reductions, but internal loading can delay the lake responses, especially in the most downstream lake, Lake Winnebago, where internal P loading was most important to its summer P budget. Accurately quantifying net internal P loading and using this information in lake models are important in evaluating how large shallow lakes should respond to P reduction strategies, setting realistic expectations from watershed P reductions, and guiding TMDL efforts.

Microbial degradation of organic matter in water-saturated soils is the most important source for the climate-relevant trace gas CH4. Although ponds and lakes cover a substantial fraction of the land surface of northern Siberia, data on CH4 fluxes from these water bodies are scarce. Summer CH4 fluxes were measured with closed chambers at the margins of ponds vegetated by vascular plants and in their centers without vascular plants. Furthermore, CH4 and oxygen concentration gradients, stable carbon isotope signatures of dissolved and emitted CH4, and microbial CH4 production and CH4 oxidation were determined. Mean summer fluxes were significantly higher at the margins of the ponds (46.115.4mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) than at the centers (5.98.2mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)). CH4 transport was dominated by diffusion in most open water sites, but substantial ebullitive fluxes (12.08.1mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1)) were detected in one pond. Plant-mediated transport accounted for 70 to 90% of total CH4 fluxes above emerged vegetation. In the absence of vascular plants, 61 to 99% of the CH4 produced in the anoxic bottom soil was consumed in a layer of the submerged moss Scorpidium scorpioides, which covered the bottoms of the ponds. The fraction of CH4 oxidized was lower at sites with vascular plants since CH4 was predominantly transported through their aerenchyma, thereby bypassing the CH4 oxidation zone in the moss layer. These results emphasize the importance of moss-associated CH4 oxidation causing low CH4 fluxes from the studied Siberian ponds.					; Knoblauch, Christian/L-6776-2015; Evgrafova, Svetlana/C-4184-2014; Kutzbach, Lars/L-5765-2015	Evgrafova, Svetlana/0000-0002-2758-7361; Knoblauch, Christian/0000-0002-7147-1008; Kutzbach, Lars/0000-0003-2631-2742													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2015	120	12					2525	2541		10.1002/2015JG003053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JG003053													WOS:000368938500004

Be-10 age determinations on four of five boulders are in close agreement (less than or equal to 6% difference) with Cl-36 determinations. Hypothetical corrections for snow shielding increased the Cl-36 ages of Pinedale boulder surfaces by an average of similar to12%. Most ages for pre-Pinedale (Bull Lake) boulders fall within marine-isotope stage (MIS) 5, a time when continental and Sierran ice accumulations were small or nonexistent. Under the assumption that these boulders were deposited on moraines that formed before the end of MIS 6 (- 140 kyr BP), calculations indicated that rock-surface erosion rates would have had to range from 5.9 to 10.7 mm kyr(-1) to produce the observed Cl-36 values. When compared to rates that have been documented for the past 20 kyr, these erosion rates are extremely high. Snow shielding accounts for 0-48% of the additional years needed to shift pre-Pinedale dates to MIS 6. This suggests that some combination of snow shielding, sediment shielding, or Cl-36 leakage has greatly decreased the apparent ages of most pre-Pinedale boulders. Inability to account for the effects of these processes seriously hinders the use of cosmogenic ages of pre-Pinedale boulders as estimators of the timing of alpine glaciation.

Despite its importance, seasonal lake temperature variations are poorly understood because taking long-term measurements near the front of calving glaciers is challenging. To investigate the thermal structure and its seasonal variations, we performed year-around temperature and current measurement at depths of 58-392 m in Lago Grey, a 410-m-deep glacial lake in Patagonia. The measurement revealed critical impacts of subglacial discharge on the lake thermal condition. Water below a depth of -100 m showed the coldest temperature in mid-summer, under the influence of glacial discharge, whereas temperature in the upper layer followed a seasonal variation of air temperature. The boundary of the lower and upper layers was controlled by the depth of a sill which blocks outflow of dense and cold glacial meltwater. Our data implies that subglacial discharge and bathymetry dictate mass loss and the retreat of lake-terminating glaciers. The cold lakewater hinders underwater melting and facilitates formation of a floating terminus.

The cells are flagellated, strictly anaerobic cocci that grow optimally at 85 degrees C and 5.4 g NaCl l(-1). The strain grows heterotrophically on complex proteinaceous substrates or on appropriate salts plus amino acid mixtures and is also able to utilize maltose, starch, and pyruvate. Elemental sulfur could be replaced by cystine or thioglycollate. The range of temperatures allowing growth is from 60 to 90 degrees C; the pH supporting growth ranges from 5 to 8 (optimum, pH 7). Strain WT1 grew in a defined medium containing amino acids as the sole carbon and energy sources. The required amino acids were: Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val. Strain WT1 showed sensitivity to rifampicin. DNA G+C content was 50.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence encoding the 16S rRNA gene indicated that this isolate is a member of the Thermococcales.

J	Samuel, W; Stéphanie, B; Frédéric, S				Samuel, Westrelin; Stephanie, Bouletreau; Frederic, Santoul			European catfish Silurus glanis behaviour in response to a strong summer hypoxic event in a shallow lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Hypoxic events have always naturally occurred in freshwater ecosystems but are worsening due to anthropogenic activities. Hypoxia tolerance greatly varies among fish species and is difficult to quantify in nature in large fish species. We analysed the movements of 40 subadult and adult European catfish Silurus glanis [(727; 2150) mm] exposed to a natural summer hypoxic event in a shallow lake of southeastern France. Catfish could withstand very low dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOC), down to 1.3 mg/L in the upper half of the water column (corresponding to a mean dissolved oxygen saturation rate of 16%), when their preferred benthic habitats were anoxic. While hypoxia was becoming more severe, individuals significantly increased their activity and the surface area they visited, whatever their size. This led them to a refuge zone where they aggregated or stayed in close vicinity, very little mobile, over one and a half day during the overall anoxia of the lake. This zone, located very close to the well oxygenated water inflow, was probably one of the most oxygenated accessible zone. However, during this aggregation, the smallest individuals were more active than the largest ones. This was probably because they more often needed to move to better-oxygenated places within the gathering area, compared to larger dominant fish that occupied the best places. The ability of catfish to withstand very low DOC, along with its high optimum temperature range, could give it a competitive advantage over other predatory species in the context of global change.					westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023; Bouletreau, Stephanie/T-2915-2019	Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172; Bouletreau, Stephanie/0000-0002-0094-0196													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2022	56	4					1127	1142		10.1007/s10452-022-09952-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-022-09952-y		MAR 2022											WOS:000765653700001
J	Pettersson, K				Pettersson, K			Mechanisms for internal loading of phosphorus in lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd International Joint Conference on Limnology and Oceanography : Oceans, Rivers and Lakes - Energy and Substance Transfers at Interfaces	OCT, 1996	NANTES, FRANCE					Lake sediments play an important role in the phosphorus metabolism in lakes. The impact depends on the tendencies to retain and to release phosphorus. The internal loading will often determine the eutrophication status of the lake and the time lag for recovery after reduction of the external loading. Internal loading is most important during the summer. The potential source of phosphorus in the surficial sediments is very large in comparison to the pools in the water column. This means that even if only a very small amount is released, it will have significant impact on the phosphorus concentration in the lake water. The distribution of phosphorus forms in sediments have been investigated since the 1950s. Generally, vertical profiles of sediment phosphorus content, expressed on dry weight basis, show an increasing total content towards the sediment surface. The vertical profile continues up into the water when looking at the particulate matter. A number of environmental factors are important in the mobilisation processes. Most studies indicate that sediment bacteria have a significant role in uptake, storage and release of phosphorus including anaerobic release of iron-bound phosphorus. Several phytoplankton species have resting stages overwintering on the sediment. When growth is induced, they leave their habitat in order to shift their life-form to a pelagic one. In Lake Erken the cyanobacteria Gloeotrichia echinulata has been shown to contribute significantly to the internal loading of phosphorus during the summer.																			0018-8158						1998	374						21	25																WOS:000076609900003
J	Levine, SN; Schindler, DW				Levine, SN; Schindler, DW			Influence of nitrogen to phosphorus supply ratios and physicochemical conditions on cyanobacteria and phytoplankton species composition in the Experimental Lakes Area, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To test the hypothesis that N:P supply ratios influence phytoplankton species composition, and particularly that cyanobacteria are favored by a low ratio, mesocosms at one pelagic and two littoral sites within the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario, were fertilized for 10-12 weeks with similar amounts of P but different amounts of N. Total N:P supply (L-N:L-P) ratios (fertilizer plus natural inputs) ranged from 8:1 to 50:1. Nitrogen deficiency was detected in all mesocosms with L-N:L-P ratios <17:1, but N-2-fixing Anabaena gained dominance only in the low-N:P pelagic mesocosms, and only in late summer. Cryptophytes and (or) chlorophytes dominated littoral mesocosms at all N:P ratios, while Pseudoanabaena catenata, a nonheterocystous cyanobacterium, was the late-summer dominant in pelagic mesocosms with L-N:L-P ratios >17:1. Canonical correlation analysis related cyanobacterial dominance to high P and low CO2 availability. Low light intensities and low N:P ratios also favored heterocystous (but not nonheterocystous) cyanobacteria. Total phytoplankton biomass and productivity increased with L-N:L-P ratio, while periphyton growth was maximal at low N:P ratios. Nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton may encourage blooms of N-2 fixers or drive productivity down to the sediment surface where N is more available.

The concentrations of 23 antibiotics in the gills, muscles, kidneys, livers, biles, and brains of Cyprinus carpio and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis caught during winter fish-hunting activities in Chagan Lake, Haernao Reservoir, and Shitoukoumen Reservoir were systematically studied to ascertain the variations among fish species and fishing regions, tissue distribution, and bioaccumulation, as well as the potential risk to humans via the consumption of contaminated fish. The results indicated that the individual antibiotic concentration in tissues ranged from undetectable to 35.0 ng/g ww. The total antibiotic concentration in fish muscles from Shitoukoumen Reservoir was lower than that from Chagan Lake and Haernao Reservoir, but showed no significant difference between Cyprinus carpio and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis. Chloramphenicols had a high proportion in most fish tissues ranging from 28.3% to 44.0%, and the antibiotics were mainly distributed in the livers with a total concentration of 54.8 +/- 9.9 ng/g ww. The mean values of bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of antibiotics in tissues ranged from 79.4 to 1000 L/kg, with the higher values found in the fish livers. The hazard quotient and hazard index value of antibiotics in the muscles of fish from ice-sealed were less than 1, indicating a negligible risk to human health via the consumption of fish muscles. This study revealed that the total antibiotic concentration in muscles showed spatial variations but not fish species dependence. The antibiotics mainly accumulated in the livers. In addition, the target antibiotic concentrations in the muscles of fish from ice-sealed waters met the safe for consumption criteria.

Here, we analyzed the genetic, temporal, and geographic correlations of these 63 HPAIVs to elucidate their dissemination throughout the prefecture. Full-genome sequence analysis of the Ibaraki isolates showed that 7 segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS) were derived from G1.1.9 strains while the M segment was from G1.1 strains; both groups of strains circulated in south China. Pathological studies revealed severe systemic infection in dead swans (the majority of dead birds and the only species necropsied), thus indicating high susceptibility to H5N6 HPAIVs. Coalescent phylogenetic analysis using the 7 G1.1.9-derived segments enabled detailed analysis of the short-term evolution of these highly homologous HPAIVs. This analysis revealed that the H5N6 HPAIVs isolated from wild birds in Ibaraki Prefecture were divided into 7 groups. Spatial analysis demonstrated that most of the cases concentrated around Senba Lake originated from a single source, and progeny viruses were transmitted to other locations after the infection expanded in mute swans. In contrast, within just a 5-km radius of the area in which cases were concentrated, three different intrusions of H5N6 HPAIVs were evident. Multi-segment analysis of short-term evolution showed that not only was the invading virus spread throughout Ibaraki Prefecture but also that, despite the small size of this region, multiple invasions had occurred during winter 2016-2017.

Characterizing soundscape patterns is important for understanding how human and natural processes affect mountain acoustic environments.ObjectivesWe aim to characterize summer soundscapes across major mountain habitats by examining how acoustic characteristics and soundscape components vary spatio-temporally and relate to multiple environmental variables.MethodsWe deployed audio recorders across 44 sites in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen district of the Northern European Limestone Alps, Germany, covering nine habitat types during summer. We characterized their soundscapes by using eight acoustic indicators and soundscape components (anthrophony, biophony, and geophony), examining their relationships with habitat types, landscape structure, and diel periods.ResultsSoundscapes varied by habitat type, with alpine grasslands and rocky habitats featuring less diverse, distinct soundscapes compared to montane and valley habitats (e.g., intensively and extensive used grasslands, forests, lakes/rivers), with persistent aircraft sound in alpine sites. Differences in soundscape characteristics were related to elevation, distance to infrastructure, and landscape structure. Diel patterns revealed that biophony dominates at dawn, while anthrophony prevailed at other times, with habitat-specific variations.ConclusionsIn mountain landscapes, soundscapes vary according to habitat type, landscape gradients, and diel period, with anthrophony present even in high-alpine areas. Incorporating landscape characteristics into soundscape assessments offered insights into important covariates at a broader spatial scale. The results emphasize the potential of integrating soundscape considerations into mountain landscape management accounting for acoustic environments.

No difference in either net N mineralization or nitrification was observed between the two adjacent catchments despite differences in catchment N export. Annual rates of net N mineralization in surface 10 cm were higher in forest soils of the deciduous (11.5 +/- 3.1 g/m(2); mean +/- SE) and conifer-mixed (conifer-hardwoods) (13.9 +/- 2.3 g/m(2)) stands than in peatland soils (1.6 +/- 0.6 g/m(2)). Mean annual nitrification rates were higher in deciduous soils (6.6 +/- 0.7 g N/m(2)) than in mixed stands (1.9 +/- 0.6 g N/m(2)) and peatland soils (0.1 +/- 0.2 g N/m(2)). Annual net N mineralization and nitrification were correlated with variations in soil C and N content and moisture associated with different forest stands. Frequent winter incubations indicate that net mineralization and nitrification under snow cover in upland surface soils can contribute as much as 49 and 23% of the annual net production, respectively. The importance of forest vegetation patterns, winter N transformations, and dissolved organic N pools to total N and NO3- cycling and leaching in these catchments is discussed.

Such events did not result in sufficient mixing to recharge nutrient stocks of these areas. Upwellings were characterized as temporal displacements of nearshore water masses which returned at the end of each event. Plankton communities of the nearshore area were displaced with the water mass and therefore received little or no benefit from the upwelled nutrient rich hypolimnetic waters. Diatom species such as Asterionella formosa Hass and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton appear to be able to grow in the upwelled hypolimnetic water, and upwellings might be a mechanism to inoculate these species into the epilimnion of deep lakes prior to the autumn overturn. Upwelling events also caused rapid shifts in the species composition of zooplankton communities. Such shifts were particularly pronounced within 1 km of the shoreline.

Therefore, in this work, the basic performance of an independent microgrid consisting of tidal power generators, photovoltaics, fuel cells, and heat pumps to locally produce energy for local consumption was analyzed. Fast tidal currents near inlets that join lakes to the sea were converted into electrical energy via a three-phase synchronized generator connected to Darius water turbines. On the basis of the results of an oceanographic survey, the production of electricity and the CO2 emissions of each generator were calculated using balanced equations for electricity and heat. The calculations indicated that 33% of the CO2 emissions were associated with the energy supplied through conventional methods during the summer season. Although the frequency and waveform of the electricity of the microgrid were high quality, improvement in the voltage regulation was still required. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, BQ; Yu, ZB; Liang, ZM; Acharya, K				Li, Binquan; Yu, Zhongbo; Liang, Zhongmin; Acharya, Kumud			Hydrologic response of a high altitude glacierized basin in the central Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Hydrologic cycles of most high altitude glacierized watersheds in the Tibetan Plateau are not closely monitored due to their inaccessibility. Understanding the hydrologic cycle in such a basin may provide insight into the role climate plays on changes in glacier mass. Thus, hydrologic simulations with a physical perspective in the Tibetan glacierized watershed are of great significance. A high altitude glacierized basin in the central Tibetan Plateau, Qugaqie basin, was investigated with an energy-balance based glacier-melt model and the Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA) model. With these two models, glacier mass balance was estimated and basin runoff from glaciers was simulated at a daily time step. Results from the simulation period (October 1, 2006 September 30, 2011) demonstrated that the glaciers experienced a large negative surface mass balance with the cumulative value of -300 cm w.e.. In other words, up to 13.93 x 10(6) m(3) water volume was melting out from the glaciers during these five years. In the 2007/08 year, however, the glaciers experienced a surplus mass balance because of the low air temperature and increased precipitation in the summer season. Infiltration, evapotranspiration (ET), and overland flow were also calculated using the GSSHA model. Results showed that precipitation, the main water source, contributed roughly 95% to the total mass gain of the annual water balance in the Qugaqie basin during the study period, while the glacial runoff (snow/ice melting) contributed 5% water balance. In the water loss, 17% of annual water volume was consumed by the ET process. As a result, the remaining water volume (83%) converted to the basin river flow to the Lake Nam Co. In the summertime, the glacial runoff accounted for 15% of the total basin runoff volume, while this contribution increased in the upstream portion to 46% due to a large percentage of glacierized area. The analysis showed that the glacial runoff contributions to the total river flow decrease significantly due to the decreased air temperature in the summer of 2008. In general, the integrated model produced acceptable estimations of hydrologic response in this high altitude glacierized basin, which is jointly fed by precipitation and glacial runoff. This study suggests that, a process-based model for glacierized basins can provide a reasonable simulation of hydrologic response and further enhance our understanding of this high altitude region in the Tibetan Plateau.

We conducted these experiments from June through September in an artificial stream with recirculating water and used a replicated, completely randomized design. The experiment was initiated with four allopatric treatments of 14 brown trout each and four sympatric treatments of 7 brown trout and 7 steelhead each. Mortality during the experiment resulted in variable densities among replicates. Interactions with steelhead did not have negative effects on brown trout survival or growth. A model comparing the effects of total salmonine, steelhead, and brown trout densities on brown trout length suggested that intraspecific interactions had the strongest influence. Our results indicate that the steelhead did not influence the brown trout survival or growth during the summer growth period to the same extent as an equivalent number of brown trout. However, we recommend caution in combining these two species until the implications of interactions at other life history stages are examined.

J	JONES, JG; SIMON, BM; HORSLEY, RW				JONES, JG; SIMON, BM; HORSLEY, RW			MICROBIOLOGICAL SOURCES OF AMMONIA IN FRESH-WATER LAKE-SEDIMENTS	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY												During summer stratification, ammonia is released from the profundal sediments of Blelham Tarn (English Lake District). The quantity of ammonia released exceeds the consumption of nitrate in the hypolimnion. Nitrate dissimilation may be a component in the generation of ammonia, but only during early summer when nitrate is still available. The remainder of the ammonia arises largely from the deamination of proteins, amino acids and urea. Population estimates of bacteria which produced ammonia from nitrate, amino acids and urea were of the same order of magnitude. Numbers of bacteria which produced ammonia from nitrate increased with sediment depth, and urea decomposers were more numerous in the profundal (deep water) sediments. While nitrate was available in the water column, surface sediments converted nitrate almost exclusively to N2. After depletion of the nitrate, the release of ammonia from washed sediment particles was largely microbiological, whereas there was a significant chemical component to the release from intact sediment cores. Chemical binding of ammonia by the sediments was demonstrated and this hindered calculations of inorganic nitrogen metabolism based on changes in water chemistry. Trace additions of 14C-labeled protein, amino acids and urea to sediments showed that urea was turned over the most rapidly, but more reliable estimates of available protein in the sediments are required before decomposition rates can be treated with confidence.																			0022-1287						1982	128	DEC					2823	2831																WOS:A1982QA21700001

Total mercury (THg), total dissolved mercury (TEND), methylmercury (MeHg) and particle distributions in surface snow were analyzed. Results showed that THg concentrations, MeHg concentrations and particle load increased with snow surface temperature, which is an indicator of rising temperatures as the season progresses. Significant correlations between MeHg and snow surface temperature and MeHg and total particles greater than 10 urn were observed. This suggests that the MeHg found in the snow originates from atmospheric deposition processes rather than in situ snowpack sources. This study suggests that an important post-winter atmospheric deposition of MeHg and THg occurs on summital zones of the French Alps and it is likely that this contamination originates from the surrounding valleys.

However, the complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of roadside trees, diverse planting types and complex landscape heterogeneity complicate efforts to quantify the effects of these factors on above-road air temperatures. In this study, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) is used to accurately estimate roadside tree morphological parameters, such as the tree height (TH) and the diameter at breast height (DBH), and canopy structural parameters, such as the canopy thickness (CT), the canopy cover above the road (CCAD), canopy volume over the road (CVAD) and the leaf area index (LAI), to evaluate different 3D canopy geometries (py-ramidal, spherical, pileate and cylindrical). A moving meteorological station was used to continuously obtain the horizontal air temperature (AT) distribution to investigate the effects of the canopy structural parameters, the planting types and the land cover types on the above-road AT. The value of Delta AT was positively correlated with TH, CVAD, LAI and CCAD. These structural variables were most significantly correlated with Delta AT under the pileate canopy shape. However, there were no significant correlations between these factors under the cylindrical canopy shape. The physiological equivalent temperature (Delta PET) reached 7.4, 15.8, 4.5 and 17 degrees C under the cylindrical, spherical, pyramidal and pileate shapes, respectively. The Delta AT of a two-sided planting was approximately 1.7 times greater than that of a one-sided planting; the Delta RH showed a similar trend. Within 230 m of a lake, the Delta AT exhibited a logarithmic relationship with the distance from a given point to the lake. Our study quantifies the influence of the roadside tree structure on the thermal environment, which can serve as a meaningful reference for urban tree species selection and arrangement.

J	JENSEN, HS; ANDERSEN, FO				JENSEN, HS; ANDERSEN, FO			SULFATE REDUCTION IN A COASTAL LAKE DURING SUMMER STRATIFICATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Patterns of sulfate reduction in water and sediment and pelagic oxygen uptake were studied in Lake Holmsjon, Aland, Finland, during summer stratification. Sulfate reduction rate in the anoxic bottom water varied between 2 and 20 .mu.mol sulfate l-1d-1, while oxygen consumption rates in the epilimnic water varied from 50 to 100 .mu.mol oxygen l-1d-1. Sulfate reduction in the profundal sediment, measured by the 35SO4- core-injection technique, ranged from 100 to 500 .mu.mol sulfate l-d-1. On an areal basis this corresponded to sulfate reduction rates from 31.0 to 43.7 mmol sulfate m-2d-1, which is high compared to other lakes or coastal areas. Sulfate reduction accounted for 25-28% of the total carbon mineralization in the water and sediment column. Coefficients of the vertical eddy diffusion in the bottom water were calculated on basis of changes over time in the salinity profile. The eddy diffusion coefficient varied between 4.3 .times. 10-4 and 11.6 .times. 10-4 cm2 s-1. The sulfate flux towards the sediment was 30.3 to 42.9 mmol m-2d-1, calculated from the sulfate concentration gradients and the eddy diffusion coefficient. Thus, the flux rates agreed well with the sulfate reduction rates measured on sediment cores.

New exposures in a siliciclastic and carbonate sequence in an arid to hyperarid basin at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania provide a unique multi-proxy record of a 185Ma landscape that was exploited by early humans. The 2m thick sequence of clastics and carbonates that are exposed along a 450m outcrop records climate change over a single precession (dry-wet-dry) cycle. Siliciclastic data (sedimentary structures, grain size, mineralogy) and biological data are combined with data for a 10 to 35cm thick limestone (stable isotopes, elemental geochemistry, petrography) to generate a depositional facies model for a site DK (Douglass Korongo) on this dry rift basin landscape. This site was situated on a low gradient, distal portion of a volcaniclastic alluvial fan. The clastics are intercalated distal alluvial fan sandy silts and lake clays that accumulated in a low energy environment. Groundwater discharge and the alkaline springs and seeps during wet-to-dry change in climate made a freshwater carbonate-rich environment. Bedded lithofacies (a lime mudstone with fossils) were deposited in shallow standing (spring-fed) pools, while nodular lithofacies with calcite spherulites indicate permanently saturated ground (seeps). Both environments experienced similar diagenesis, that is, the precipitation of authigenic barite from supersaturated groundwater, desiccation and pedogenesis, and late-stage calcite precipitation. Compositional and isotopic data suggest that a fresh groundwater-fed system was available to early humans even during dry intervals of the precession cycle.

Chironomid-based reconstruction of Lateglacial summer temperatures from the Ech palaeolake record (French western Pyrenees)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Chironomid head capsules were extracted and identified in 52 samples along a sediment core retrieved from the Ech palaeololake, (710 m a.s.l. in the west-central Pyrenees). The pollen stratigraphy together with radiocarbon dates provided the basis for the chronology of the record. Since temperature changes were identified as one of the major determining factors for shifts in the Ech chironomid assemblages during the Lateglacial, July air temperatures were tentatively inferred from the chironomid record using a transfer function based on a combined Swiss and Norwegian calibration dataset. The model reconstructed July air temperatures between 10 and 13 degrees C during the Oldest Dryas, a two step increase in temperatures to 16 and 17.5 degrees C during the first part of the Interstadial followed by a decrease to 16.5 degrees C at the end of the Interstadial. The Ech record features three centennial-scale 1.5 degrees C coolings during the Interstadial. Inferred temperatures decreased to 15-15.5 degrees C during the Younger Dryas, and reached ca. 17 degrees C at the beginning of the Holocene. The applicability of the combined Swiss-Norwegian transfer function to the Pyrenean fossil record was substantiated by the good statistics of the inference and the similar distribution of taxa with respect to temperature in the Alps and the Pyrenees. The reliability of the Ech record, including its chronology, was supported by its good concordance with other previously published chironomid-based lateglacial temperature reconstructions from Europe and the NGRIP delta O-18 record.

Impacts of biofuel-based land-use change on water quality and sustainability in a Kansas watershed	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The growth in ethanol production in the United States has sparked interest in potential land-use change and the associated environmental impacts that may occur in order to accommodate the increasing demand for grain feedstocks. In this study water quality and sustainability indicators are used to evaluate the impacts of land-use change to increase corn and grain sorghum acreage for biofuel production in the Perry Lake watershed in northeast Kansas. Water quality indicators include sediment loads per converted land acreage and the relative increase of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and sediment loads compared to the baseline conditions. Sustainability indicators include land-use, water use, and nutrient use efficiencies. Hay, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and winter wheat were selected as targeted land-uses for conversion to biofuel feedstocks. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to evaluate 6 different scenarios, each at 10 land-use change increments, for a total of 60 simulations. Results demonstrate that increased corn production generates significantly greater sediment loads than increased grain sorghum production and larger relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum cropland by replacing hay or CRP land-uses resulted in the highest sediment loads and relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum by replacing winter wheat cropland produced the lowest relative changes in nutrient and sediment loads and therefore may be a more sustainable land-use change. Corn had a higher yield potential per km(2) compared to grain sorghum, resulting in better land, nutrient and water use efficiencies.

During the summer 2013, eight lakes located between 3000 and 4300 meters above sea level were sampled in a 6-day period being analysed plankton, limnological variables and flamingo abundance. Principal Component Analysis explained 80% of the system variability, permitting lakes to be ordered by salinity: subhaline (SH), hypohaline (HH) and mesohaline (MH). A total of 101 phytoplankton taxa were registered, having Bacillariophyceae the highest richness (43 species registered). HH lakes were dominated by Bacillariophyceae (between 65 and 100%), while Chlorophyceae and Euglenophyceae were more abundant in SH and MH lakes. Zooplankton was poorly represented in richness (only 21 species were registered). MH lakes were dominated by Copepoda (> 85% of total abundance) and HH lakes by Rotifera (> 51% of total abundance). It was not found a clear pattern in SH lakes. The redundancy analysis explained 70.7% of phytoplankton variability and 75.7% of zooplankton variability. Bacillariophyceae presence was associated with availability of dissolved silica (Si), while Euglenophyceae and Chlorophyceae were associated with a higher nitrogen: phosphorus ratio. Cladocera and Copepoda abundance were linked to Euglenophyceae abundance and the area of lakes while Rotifera displayed a positive relation with the concentration of dissolved organic matter. We conclude that both phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance are mainly controlled by Bottom-Up forces including dissolved Si for Bacillariophyceae, and availability of Euglenophyceae for zooplankton while salinity and altitude have an effect on plankton richness distribution.					; Frau, Diego/V-2613-2019; Mayora, Gisela/JDX-0167-2023	Frau, Diego/0000-0002-7000-8863; Mayora, Gisela/0000-0003-2839-2803; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2015	51	3					261	272		10.1051/limn/2015020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2015020													WOS:000366177800008

At six sites surveyed monthly between 2007 and 2009, we report 15 species in the dam lake, dominated by Keratella tropica, K quadrata, and to a lesser extent by Brachionus calyciflorus. Rotifer community composition changed seasonally. Summer communities were characterized by a proliferation of K tropica (92.5%), a species that, like B. calycirlorus (5.54%), tolerates high temperatures, anoxic conditions and high salinities. When water temperature dropped, K. quadrata was the most abundant species in the lake (94.6%). On the basis of faunal composition we describe this dam lake as eutrophic. The physicochemical composition of its water fluctuated.																			0249-7395					APR-JUN	2017	72	2					168	176																WOS:000398985600006

In all lakes, diapausing eggs were produced in autumn. In the large mesotrophic lake Selenter See, the population's shift to the production of diapausing eggs was more complete than in other lakes. We examined day length, temperature and food as proximate factors for the production of diapausing eggs with laboratory experiments. Eudiaptomus graciloides produced diopausing eggs in all treatments, but a significantly higher percentage of diapausing eggs was found under short day conditions except when algal food was abundant and temperature was high. To investigate the adaptive significance of diapause in E. graciloides, we compared the survival of adult and juvenile at different temperatures for E. graciloides with Eudiaptomus gracilis, a sympatric species that does not exhibit diapause. At 8degreesC, adult E. graciloides survived better than adult E. gracilis and exhibited reduced gut contents and accumulation of storage lipids, traits characteristic of adult diapause. Eudiaptomus graciloides nauplii did not reach the copepodid stage at 6degreesC, but E. gracilis nauplii We hypothesize that adult diapause and production exhibited high mortality and developed very slowly. of diapausing eggs facilitate the survival of E. graciloides during cold periods and enhance coexistence with its congener, E gracilis, in temperate zones.

Sex-based differences in spawning behavior account for male-biased harvest in Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Sex- and size-specific reproductive behaviors can increase the vulnerability of certain demographic components of fish populations to exploitation, potentially leading to unsustainable harvest. Lake Erie's largest walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning population, which aggregates on the Ohio reef complex during spring, is subject to angling. Information on the sex composition of harvest or how reproductive behavior might influence harvest is lacking. To address these uncertainties, we implanted 337 reef-spawning individuals with acoustic transmitters, and their spawning behavior on the reef complex was monitored for 4 years using acoustic telemetry. Males arrived on spawning grounds earlier and remained on them longer than females. These behavioral differences led us to predict that recreational angler harvest during the spawning season would be male-biased. Creel surveys confirmed this prediction, although sex composition of the harvest was influenced by angling technique. Collectively, these findings suggest that sex-based differences in reproductive behaviors bias the recreational harvest toward males on the reef complex during the spawning season. This male-biased harvest seems unlikely to pose an undue risk to Lake Erie's walleye fishery.

In particular, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is one of the most sensitive regions in the world influenced by global climate change. In this study, we use retracked Enivsat radar altimeter measurements to generate water level change time series over Lake Qinghai and Lake Ngoring in the northeastern QTP and examine their relationships with precipitation and temperature changes. The response of water levels in Lake Qinghai and Lake Ngoring is positive with regards to precipitation amount. There is a negative relationship between water level and temperature change. These findings further the idea that the arid and high-elevation lakes in the northeastern QTP are highly sensitive to climate variations. Water level increases in Lake Qinghai in winter may indicate inputs of subsurface water associated with freeze-thaw cycles in the seasonally frozen ground and the active layer.					; Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021; Guo, Jun-Yi/E-9608-2011; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/NDT-1118-2025	Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/0000-0003-3581-076X; Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; 													1017-0839					APR	2011	22	2			SI		169	175		10.3319/TAO.2010.08.09.01(TibXS)	http://dx.doi.org/10.3319/TAO.2010.08.09.01(TibXS)													WOS:000289592200008
J	Graveland, J				Graveland, J			Reed die-back, water level management and the decline of the Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus in The Netherlands	ARDEA												Several species of migratory marsh birds have declined in Central and Western Europe. An important question is whether this decline is primarily caused by loss of wetlands on the wintering grounds in Africa or by a decline in habitat quality in the breeding areas. Significant losses of Reed Phragmites australis beds have been reported in many European countries, presumably as a result of unnatural water level regimes and eutrophication. We studied the reed requirements of nesting Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus in relation to reed availability in The Netherlands. Numbers of Great Reed Warblers have declined dramatically but the species is less dependent on marshland in its winter quarters than most other migratory marsh birds. Great Reed Warblers nested almost exclusively in reed standing in water and this type of reed has become scarce in The Netherlands. The present distribution of water reed indicates that the man-induced reduction in natural fluctuations of the water level has been an important factor in its decline. Water reed represents the first stage of the succession in a reed marsh. Eventually, loss of water reed will therefore affect the entire marsh bird community. Restoration of natural water level fluctuations seems the most effective course for remedial action, but will be difficult to accomplish because of the conflicting interests of nature and agriculture.																			0373-2266						1998	86	2					187	201																WOS:000079218100006

Natural and anthropogenic factors play an important role in determining resultant trace metals' concentrations in the region. We place particular emphasis on the saline "lakes" of Malo Jezero and Veliko Jezero, which have restricted flows of seawater. In Malo Jezerc, lake, fresh karstic spring water generated by flooding, and weathering of dolomites are the main sources of naturally elevated Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations (20.7 +/- 1.6, 289 +/- 19, 1260 +/- 0.08 ng L-1, respectively); anthropogenic input is negligible. In Veliko Jezero lake enhanced Cu and Zn contents originate from anthropogenic input (tourism and agriculture). Distributions of the Pb and Zn in the water columns of both lakes are influenced by natural aragonite precipitation and sedimentation. Exceptionally high total Hg concentrations of 24.2 and 33.7 ng L-1 in the water column of Malo Jezero, sampled during periods of high rainfall associated with strong eastern winds, suggest an airborne input. Total Hg concentrations in waters of both lakes are elevated because of inefficient mixing. Two different metal distribution patterns exist in the sediment columns. First, Hg, Ph, Cu and Zn show elevated concentrations in recent sediments due to anthropogenic input. Second, Cd content increases with depth due to reprecipitation via a downward redox boundary shift. Described natural processes, as well as anthropogenic influence, enhance levels of trace metals. Careful study followed by suitable interpretation based on geochemical data were necessary to distinguish natural from anthropogenic sources. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerical Simulation of Methane Emission from an Artificial Reservoir	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												In the context of the Paris Agreement, the inventory of greenhouse gases emissions by various sectors of the economy becomes especially important. Artificially flooded areas are well known as sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O for the atmosphere, while the existing inventory methods for such objects do not explicitly take into account many important physical and biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for the formation of these emissions. A new version of the one-dimensional (in vertical) physical and biogeochemical model LAKE (version 2.3) is adapted for water bodies with significant through flow; i.e., it takes into account the sources/sinks of all prognostic variables due to inflows and effluent streams, as well as the average vertical speed and level fluctuations. The model reproduces the processes of vertical transfer of heat and radiation in the water column, the formation of ice and snow in winter, the thermal conductivity and phase transitions in bottom sediments at different depths, generation, diffusion, and the bubble transport of methane from bottom sediments to the surface; the model also calculates a complex of other biogeochemical variables, including dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, the content of phyto- and zooplankton, dissolved organic carbon, dead particles, etc. Using the model, we calculated one annual cycle (2016-2017) of the thermodynamic and hydrochemical state of the Mozhaisk artificial reservoir, forced by the data of meteorological measurements. The simulated horizontally averaged vertical distribution of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and methane content agrees satisfactorily with the observational data for the summer of 2017. At the same time, significant horizontal inhomogeneity is noticeable in the measurement data, especially in the methane concentration. The parameterization of horizontal heterogeneity effects is an important task for the future development of the model. According to the simulation results during the period from August 2016 to August 2017, the total methane flux from the reservoir to the atmosphere was 570 Mg/year, of which 80% is ebullition from the surface of the water body, 15% is the surface diffusion flux, and 5% of methane leaves the reservoir through the dam. Thus, the proposed model can be considered a tool for inventorying the emission of greenhouse gases from artificial water bodies.

Community structure and function of high-temperature chlorophototrophic microbial mats inhabiting diverse geothermal environments	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Six phototrophic microbial mat communities from different geothermal springs (YNP) were studied using metagenome sequencing and geochemical analyses. The primary goals of this work were to determine differences in community composition of high-temperature phototrophic mats distributed across the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem, and to identify metabolic attributes of predominant organisms present in these communities that may correlate with environmental attributes important in niche differentiation. Random shotgun metagenome sequences from six phototrophic communities (average similar to 53 Mbp/site) were subjected to multiple taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional analyses. All methods, including G + C content distribution, MEGAN analyses, and oligonucleotide frequency-based clustering, provided strong support for the dominant community members present in each site. Cyanobacteria were only observed in non-sulfidic sites; de novo assemblies were obtained for Synechococcus-like populations at Chocolate Pots (CP_7) and Fischerella-like populations at White Creek (WC_6). Chloroflexi-like sequences (esp. Rosei-flexus and/or Chloroflexus spp.) were observed in all six samples and contained genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and the 3-hydroxypropionate carbon fixation pathway. Other major sequence assemblies were obtained for a Chlorobiales population from CP_7 (proposed family Thermochlorobacteriaceae), and an anoxygenic, sulfur-oxidizing Thermochromatium-like (Gamma-proteobacteria) population from Bath Lake Vista Annex (BLVA_20). Additional sequence coverage is necessary to establish more complete assemblies of other novel bacteria in these sites (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes); however, current assemblies suggested that several of these organisms play important roles in heterotrophic and fermentative metabolisms. Definitive linkages were established between several of the dominant phylotypes present in these habitats and important functional processes such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, sulfur oxidation, and fermentation.

Furthermore, for sister taxa that have little niche differentiation, behavioural dominance can affect the distribution and abundance of the subordinate species. Here, aggression and behavioural dominance were investigated between two closely related sister taxa, the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos and American Black Duck A. rubripes (hereon Black Duck) at Cayuga Lake, New York, from January-March in 2015-2017. Specifically-, the observed number of aggressors, aggressive behaviours performed, aggressive behaviours received and the number of victims of aggression, determined by analysing video footage obtained from Go-Pro cameras mounted in traps baited with corn, were compared to expected frequency of these activities. Expected frequencies were based on the number of individuals of each species and sex identified in the footage at a trap site during each recording period. Behavioural dominance also was determined by quantifying the probability of a species-sex class being deterred from using these feeding sites when threatened. Male Mallards were more common, aggressive and dominant than Black Ducks. Female Black Ducks were deterred from feeding sites by aggression from male Mallards more than other species-sex classes. Results suggest that Mallard dominance could decrease the carrying capacity for Black Ducks at our wintering area study site, through interference during foraging and displacement from feeding locations. If this pattern is occurring elsewhere, it could contribute to changes in distributions, and possibly declines in abundance, of Black Ducks through secondary contact with Mallards.

The species is compared molecularly (fragments of two genes: mitochondrial CO1 and ribosomal 18 S) with G. codreanui from Bulgaria, G. serbica (Radoman, 1973) from its type locality, Belgrandiella haesitans (Westerlund, 1881) from the spring of the Louros River, and Orientalina delphica (Radoman, 1973) from the spring Kastalia at Delphi. All the five populations were found to belong to the genus Grossuana: G. codreanui, G. serbica, G. vurliana (Radoman, 1966), and G. dephica (Radoman, 1973), respectively. We applied 12 morphological characters of Grossuana and 17 other rissooidean genera (mostly of the Hydrobiidae s. stricto) to infer phylogeny, which has shown the position of the genus within the Hydrobiidae s. stricto, most close to Orientalina. All the molecular data confirm that Grossuana is a distinct genus belonging to the Hydrobiidae, Horatiinae, whose closest relatives are Belgrandia, Orientalina and Horatia.					; Sirbu, Ioan/AAD-1176-2020; Sîrbu, Ioan/AAD-1176-2020	Grzmil, Pawel/0000-0001-9780-2007; Sirbu, Ioan/0000-0001-9020-1129; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2007	579						379	391		10.1007/s10750-006-0530-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0530-4													WOS:000244187200030

Retail Baitfish in Michigan Harbor Serious Fish Viral Pathogens	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Indigenous small cyprinid fish species play an important role in Great Lakes ecosystems and also comprise the backbone of a multimillion-dollar baitfish industry. Due to their widespread use in sport fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes, there are increasing concerns that baitfish may introduce or disseminate fish pathogens. In this study, we evaluated whether baitfish purchased from 78 randomly selected retail bait dealers in Michigan harbored fish viruses. Between September 2015 and June 2016, 5,400 baitfish divided into 90 lots of 60 fish were purchased. Fish were tested for the presence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), golden shiner reovirus (GSRV), fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV), fathead minnow picornavirus (FHMPV), and white sucker bunyavirus (WSBV). Using the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line and molecular confirmation, we demonstrated the presence of viruses in 18 of the 90 fish lots (20.0%) analyzed. The most prevalent virus was FHMNV, being detected in 6 of 30 lots of Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas and 3 of 42 lots of Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides. We also confirmed GSRV in two fish species: the Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas (5 of 11 lots) and Fathead Minnow (3 of 30 lots). Two VHSV (genotype IVb) isolates were recovered from a single lot of Emerald Shiners. No SVCV, FHMPV, or WSBV was detected in any of the fish examined. Some of the infected fish exhibited clinical signs and histopathological alterations. This study demonstrates that live baitfish are a potential vector for the spread of viral pathogens and underscores the importance of fish health certifications for the Great Lakes baitfish industry.

Spatiotemporal patterns of water quality in Lake Ontario and their implications for nuisance growth of Cladophora	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study, motivated by a resurgence in Cladophora, investigates changes in the nutrient environment in the littoral zone of Lake Ontario. We measured nutrient concentrations from 2004 to 2008 at two littoral zone (2-12 m) sites on the north shore of Lake Ontario where Cladophora has experienced a resurgence and compared concentrations with data collected in the late 1970s. Spring total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations have significantly declined at these two sites. Furthermore, P loading from the major tributaries to our study sites declined between 1964 and 2008. Upwelling events were not detectably associated with increases in P concentrations at our sites. We conclude that a recent upsurge in nuisance Cladophora, at least at these sites, cannot be explained by deteriorating littoral zone water quality in terms of P concentrations or by changes in catchment loading. For additional context, we also examined trends in coastal (14-20 m) and offshore (>50 m) nutrients using Environment Canada epilimnetic surveillance data, 1975-2008. Significant declines in TP and SRP concentrations have occurred in north coast waters, concurrent with declines in the offshore. However, nutrient concentrations, notably spring SRP, have not decreased among south coast stations, potentially reflecting greater coastal entrapment of catchment-derived waters. We infer that EC-monitored north coast stations reflect integrated interannual water quality, while south coast stations are more strongly influenced by catchment loading. The effects of higher nutrient concentrations along the south coast, which co-occur with lower water transparency, on benthic algal growth have yet to be determined.

Predation risk can influence migratory dynamics, but whether seasonal migrants can adjust their migratory behaviour according to perceived risk is unknown. We used electronic tags to record the migration of individual roach (Rutilus rutilus), a partially migratory fish, in the wild following exposure to manipulation of direct (predator presence/absence) and indirect (high/low roach density) perceived predation risk in experimental mesocosms. Following exposure, we released fish in their lake summer habitat and monitored individual migration to connected streams over an entire season. Individuals exposed to increased perceived direct predation risk (i.e. a live predator) showed a higher migratory propensity but no change in migratory timing, while indirect risk (i.e. roach density) affected timing but not propensity showing that elevated risk carried over to alter migratory behaviour in the wild. Our key finding demonstrates predator-driven migratory plasticity, highlighting the powerful role of predation risk for migratory decision-making and dynamics.

Major histocompatibility complex diversity is positively associated with stream water temperatures in proximate populations of sockeye salmon	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Local adaptation to heterogeneous environments generates population diversity within species, significantly increasing ecosystem stability and flows of ecosystem services. However, few studies have isolated the specific mechanisms that create and maintain this diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between water temperature in streams used for spawning and genetic diversity at a gene involved in immune function [the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)] in 14 populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) sampled across the Wood River basin in south-western Alaska. The largest influence on MHC diversity was lake basin, but we also found a significant positive correlation between average water temperature and MHC diversity. This positive relationship between temperature and MHC diversity appears to have been produced by natural selection at very local scales rather than neutral processes, as no correlation was observed between temperature and genetic diversity at 90 neutral markers. Additionally, no significant relationship was observed between temperature variability and MHC diversity. Although lake basin was the largest driver of differences in MHC diversity, our results also demonstrate that fine-scale differences in water temperature may generate variable selection regimes in populations that spawn in habitats separated by as little as 1km. Additionally, our results indicated that some populations may be reaching a maximum level of MHC diversity. We postulate that salmon from populations in warm streams may delay spawning until late summer to avoid thermal stress as well as the elevated levels of pathogen prevalence and virulence associated with warm temperatures earlier in the summer.

Forest management decisions, such as initial stand density, can promote climatic resiliency and moderate decreased productivity through the reduction of tree competition. The influences of climate (temperature and precipitation) and forest management (initial stand density) on the productivity of red pine (Pinus resinosa) across multiple sites within Huron National Forest, Michigan, were examined using dendrochronological methods. Two common planting regimes were compared in this analysis; low initial density (<988 trees per hectare) and high initial density (>1977 trees per hectare). Low initial density stands were found to have a higher climatic resilience by combining equal or greater measures of productivity, while having a reduced sensitivity to monthly and seasonal climate, particularly to summer drought.

By around c. 10,000-9400 cal yr BP, a large shallow freshwater lake had formed in the Kumphawapi basin. Oxygenated bottom waters and a well-mixed water column were characteristic of this early lake stage, which was probably initiated by higher effective moisture and a stronger summer monsoon. Decreased run-off after c. 6700 cal yr BP favored increased aquatic productivity in the shallow lake. Multiple proxies indicate a marked lowering of the lake level around 5900 cal yr BP, the development of an extensive wetland around 5400 cal yr BP, and the subsequent transition to a peatland. The shift from shallow lake to wetland and later to a peatland is interpreted as a response to lower effective moisture. A hiatus at the transition from wetland to peatland suggests very low accumulation rates, which may result from very dry climatic conditions. A rise in groundwater and lake level around 3200 cal yr BP allowed the re-establishment of a wetland in the Kumphawapi basin. However, the sediments deposited between c. 3200 and 1600 cal yr BP provide evidence for at least two hiatuses at c. 2700-2500 cal yr BP, and at c. 1900-1600 cal yr BP, which would suggest surface dryness and consequently periods of low effective moisture. Around 1600 cal yr BP a new shallow lake became re-established in the basin. Although the underlying causes for this new lake phase remain unclear, we hypothesize that higher effective moisture was the main driving force. This shallow lake phase continued up to the present but was interrupted by higher nutrient fluxes to the lake around 1000-600 cal yr BP. Whether this was caused by intensified human impact in the catchment or, whether this signals a lowering of the lake level due to reduced effective moisture, needs to be corroborated by further studies in the region. The multi-proxy study of Kumphawapi's sediment core CP3A clearly shows that Kumphawapi is a sensitive archive for recording past shifts in effective moisture, and as such in the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. Many more continental paleorecords, however, will be needed to fully understand the spatial and temporal patterns of past changes in Asian monsoon intensity and its ecosystem impacts.

Phosphorus Fractions and Its Summer's Release Flux from Sediment in the China's Three Gorges Reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												The amounts and forms of phosphorus (P) in sediments, orthophosphate (Pi) concentrations as well as Pi release fluxes across the sediment-water interface were investigated from five sampling sites in the Three-Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The Total P (TP) contents of surface sediments (0-2 cm) ranged from 415.5 to 1047.9 mg/kg, and the predominant fraction was HCl-P (Ca-bound P). The main rank order of P-fractions was HCl-P > Res-P (Residual-P) > NaOH-P (Al-adsorbed P) > BD-P (Redox sensitive P) > NH4Cl-P (Labile P), and ranged from 164.5 to 687.2 mg/kg, 96.0 to 140.8 mg/kg, 75.8 to 111.5 mg/kg, 34.0 to 104.8 mg/kg, and 5.9 to 15.9 mg/kg, respectively. The pH values ranged from 6.4 to 8.2 across sediment-water interface and sediment pH values were lower than those of the corresponding overlying water. The average Pi concentrations of pore water were higher than those of the open water and overlying water. Based on calculations using the Fick's first law, sediment in Xiangxi River (XX03) functioned as a P sink, with Pi flux of -0.003 mg/m(2)/d, while sediments from Modaoxi03 (MDX03), Daning02 (DN02), Caotanghe (CTH) and Changjiang Badong (CJBD), had Pi fluxes of 0.013 mg/m(2)/d, 0.009 mg/m(2)/d, 0.004 mg/m(2)/d and 0.007 mg/m(2)/d, respectively, and served as an internal P source in summer.																			1726-2135	1684-8799				MAR	2015	25	1					36	45		10.3808/jei.201400260	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.201400260													WOS:000352826500004

In spring 2004, a so far unknown Cardamine (Brassicaceae) was detected at the lake-shores. In the subsequent years, this taxon has spread rapidly, 95 locations have been recorded until spring 2007. We tested the utility of DNA sequences to distinguish between two alternative hypotheses regarding the appearance of this new invasive taxon: a local formation via hybridization between native species versus an introduction of a non-native taxon. The relative DNA contents was analysed as an additional independent character. DNA sequences provided substantial evidence that the unknown Cardamine taxon, recently discovered at Lake Constance in southwest Germany, is a non-native species introduced from abroad. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of the large subunits of nuclear ribosomal DNA and two noncoding regions of chloroplast DNA (trnL intron, trnL/F spacer) were distant from sequences of all native Cardamine species providing evidence against a hybridization hypothesis. In contrast, DNA sequences of the unknown Cardamine were identical to one accession of Cardamine flexuosa auct. non With. (Asian C. flexuosa) from Japan. The introduction history of Asian C. flexuosa at Lake Constance and the potential threat to the native lake-shore vegetation is discussed. Our study highlights the potential of DNA sequences to identify invasive genotypes and source regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding historical climatic patterns, especially during the Holocene epoch, is crucial. Various proxy archives in Pakistan offer valuable resources for accurately reconstructing paleoclimatic conditions. This paper compiles and reviews available paleoclimate records to comprehensively understand Holocene climate variations in Pakistan, focusing on the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and Westerly variations. While some proxies like tree rings have been well- studied, others, such as ice cores, peat, lake sediments, and speleothems, remain largely unexplored. Our synthesis indicates heightened frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the past century, centennial- scale variations showing a shift from persistent dry conditions to punctuated wet periods, and notable climatic anomalies like the Medieval Warm Period/Anomaly (MWM) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). Mid-to-late Holocene witnessed decreased precipitation, possibly contributing to the decline of ancient civilizations. Early Holocene was comparatively more humid, with glacier advancements around 8-9 kyr BP (cal). The review advocates for generating high-resolution data and revisiting multiple sites across diverse climatic zones to refine climatic reconstructions.

A detailed study site between Cerro Caliente and Crater Lake was selected for the detailed mapping of hummocky terrains and for modelling their spatial distribution according to controlling geographical factors. A model of the susceptibility of occurrence of the hummocky terrains was created using the information value method, together with five independent variables: elevation, slope, global summer radiation, total curvature and lithology. Success and prediction rate curves were used for model validation and the Area Under the Curve index was used to quantify the levels of performance and prediction. The results were of high quality with a success rate of 88% and a prediction rate of 78%. The classes of the independent variables with more relevance in the occurrence of hummocky terrains were: elevation between 20-30 m and 60-70 m; concave or rectilinear/flat areas; slopes between 8 and 12((sic)); tuff cones and maar deposits and global summer radiation between 1.8 and 2.0 TJm(-2).

Similarity scaling of turbulence in a temperate lake during fall cooling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Turbulence, quantified as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (epsilon), was measured with 1400 temperature-gradient microstructure profiles obtained concurrently with time series measurements of temperature and current profiles, meteorology, and lake-atmosphere fluxes using eddy covariance in a 4 km(2) temperate lake during fall cooling. Winds varied from near calm to 5 m s(-1) but reached 10 m s(-1) during three storm events. Near-surface values of e were typically on the order of 10(-8) to 1027 m(2) s(-3) and reached 10(-5) m(2) s(-3) during windy periods. Above a depth equal to vertical bar L-MO vertical bar, the Monin-Obukhov length scale, turbulence was dominated by wind shear and dissipation followed neutral law of the wall scaling augmented by buoyancy flux during cooling. During cooling, epsilon(z) = 0.56 u(*W)(3)/kz + 0.77 J(BO) and during heating epsilon(z) = 0.6 u(*w)(3)/kz, where u(*w) is the water friction velocity computed from wind shear stress, k is von Karman's constant, z is depth, and J(BO) is surface buoyancy flux. Below a depth equal to vertical bar L-MO vertical bar during cooling, dissipation was uniform with depth and controlled by buoyancy flux. Departures from similarity scaling enabled identification of additional processes that moderate near-surface turbulence including mixed layer deepening at the onset of cooling, high-frequency internal waves when the diurnal thermocline was adjacent to the air-water interface, and horizontal advection caused by differential cooling. The similarity scaling enables prediction of near-surface e as required for estimating the gas transfer coefficient using the surface renewal model and for understanding controls on scalar transport.

In the Tibetan Plateau (TP), most glaciers have been retreating at unprecedented rate in recent decades, acting as one of the most active factors in regional hydrological cycling. In this mini-review, we summarized recent studies on Hg distribution, transport, and accumulation in Tibetan glacierized environments. We highlight that melting glacier may represent a stimulator that exports Hg to glacier-fed ecosystems. We identified major knowledge gaps and proposed future research needs with several emphases, including quantifying Hg in glacier ablation zone, depicting Hg transport and transformation in glacial rivers during spring melt season, and better constraining glacier-export Hg and its environmental risks to the downstream. Besides, Hg isotopic technical, passive sampling and hydrological transport model should be utilized to improve the understanding of Hg cycling in high mountain regions in the TP.

The method was first applied to Lake Kortowskie in 1956 and continues today. The direct effects of hypolimnetic withdrawal can be observed in the near-bottom waters during the pipe's operation (May-Sep). The treatment depends on the quantity of water withdrawn by the pipe. A high withdrawal rate increased the rate of hypolimnetic heating, diminished the water mass stability and shortened summer stagnation. Hypolimnetic withdrawal did not improve the oxygen conditions in Lake Kortowskie, although it shortened the duration of the anaerobic conditions near the bottom and diminished the spatial extent of oxygen deficiency. Increased release of phosphorus from the bottom deposits to the near-bottom water and finally the outlet via the withdrawal pipe has been observed, with a consequent impoverishment of the upper sediments. The amount of mineral phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen in the near-bottom water decreased independent of the withdrawn volume. The decrease of phosphorus and nitrogen during the pipe's operation shows that hypolimnetic withdrawal removes nutrients released from bottom deposits so that the lake becomes less enriched in nutrients. Multi-year examination has confirmed that this process is the most positive feature of this restoration method. The restoration can be optimized by maximizing nutrient export and withdrawing throughout the summer stagnation (particularly in August and September), when nutrient concentrations near the bottom are maximal.

Time and temperature for optimum germination of urediospores of the 1st 2 rust fungi were different: 45 hr. and 24 C for the golden-rod rust and 20 hr. and 20 C for the aster rust. About half the spores from A. macrophyllus germinated in 25 hr. at 16 C compared with only 3% of the spores from S. canadensis. In the rust infecting red pine and goldenrod, pycnia appeared on pine in April and May following fall infection. Aecia appeared a month after pycnia. Thick-walled aeciospores averaged 19.1 x 31.1 [mu]; they infected goldenrod in 25 hr. at 20 C and 100% relative humidity. Uredia appeared 10-11 days after aeciospore or previous urediospore infection of goldenrod, mostly in June and July. Urediospores infected goldenrod under the same conditions as aeciospores. Urediospores from goldenrod (18.0 x 27.5[mu]) were significantly wider than those from aster (16.3 x 27.3 [mu]) and were a darker orange. Freezing was detrimental to germination of urediospores and teliospores. Basidiospores (14 x 25 [mu]) released from germinating teliospores on goldenrod infected pine needles in Sept. and Oct. in wet weather near 20 C. Minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for germination of teliospores and basidiospores were 12, 20, and 24 C. After fall infections, the rust was perennial in the needles until the needles died. The same needle often had both new and old infections in it during its 2nd and 3rd years. In numerous tests, the rusts did not overwinter on goldenrod or aster in Wisconsin or Minnesota.																			0031-949X	1943-7684					1968	58	6					822	+																WOS:A1968B293500065

Gut microbiome composition is closely related to external environments. In this study, we identified the effects of seasonal changes on the composition and main metabolites of symbiotic microorganisms in the intestine of A. japonicus. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify the composition of symbiotic microorganisms in different seasons. Intestinal metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, which linked symbiotic microorganisms to intestinal metabolites. Analyzing changes in intestinal microbial composition across different seasons. The results showed that seasonal changes of intestinal microorganisms were significant, A. japonicus were infected by Vibrio easily in summer, Stigmasterol and sitosterol could affect the growth of body wall of A. japonicus.

Neotectonics and vertical offset of block movements were analyzed through detection of peneplain remnants, digital elevation modeling, and interpretation of aerial and satellite imagery. Lineaments expressed in the surface topography and/or distinguished on aerial and satellite images fall into three groups. Those of the first two groups are neotectonic normal faults, and the other lineaments, without any geomorphically expressed vertical component, have been interpreted as eroded structures of the pre-Cenozoic basement. Structures of different types often belong to a single lineament and may correspond to reactivated and stable neotectonic segments of old basement faults. The revealed neotectonic blocks rarely exceed a few kilometers across. Most of normal faults cut the sides of the Teletsk and the adjacent Kamga and Koldor grabens, where neotectonic vertical offset reaches its maximum of 400-1200 m (against 300 m in other grabens). Tectonic control of the surface topography in the region is evident from long V-shaped river valleys that follow zones of weakness. Some valleys are incised as deep as 600-800 m, with a total topographic gradient of 1600 m. Recent water-level fall in Lake Teletskoe, the regional base level of erosion, is another cause of intense erosion besides tectonics.					; Vysotsky, E/A-3454-2014	Vysotsky, Eugene/0009-0005-9921-0976; 													0016-7886						2002	43	12					1099	1106																WOS:000180477300005

J	Smalley, IJ; Kumar, R; Dhand, KO; Jefferson, IF; Evans, RD				Smalley, IJ; Kumar, R; Dhand, KO; Jefferson, IF; Evans, RD			The formation of silt material for terrestrial sediments: Particularly loess and dust	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												There are certain controls which operate to demarcate the nature and size range of quartz particles in terrestrial detrital sediments. The particles fall into discrete and definable populations, which are separated by 'Tanner gaps'. Quartz sand nature is determined largely by a eutectic-like reaction, which takes place in the original igneous rock. This reaction delivers a fine mix of quartz and feldspar units, which on weathering deliver quartz sand. The formation of quartz silt is more contentious; it appears that silt production is essentially controlled by the presence in larger quartz particles of 'Moss defects', crystalline defects introduced into the quartz structure by earlier events, e.g. the high-low displacive transformation in cooling quartz. There appear to be two modes in airborne quartz particles (which have been called large dust and small dust). The larger mode is the loess mode (around 20-60 mu m) and the smaller mode falls into the classification with high-level, long-travel dust (mode around 2-6 mu m). The quartz in small dust is around the same size as the clay mineral agglomerate particles (CMA) which form a considerable proportion of high level dust clouds. The CMA particles form from lake deposits; the size is controlled by the openness of the packing in the lake sediments. This can be demonstrated by a simple Monte Carlo model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeochemical processes and phytoplankton nutrient limitation in the inflow transition zone of a large eutrophic lake during a summer rain event	ECOHYDROLOGY												We used high-frequency sampling paired with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model application to study how dynamic variations in water, nutrient and sediment transport in a stream inflow interacted with circulation processes in a receiving eutrophic lake to affect water quality during a 5-day period of high rainfall in the summer. Wind-driven horizontal circulations in the lake caused deflection of the inflowing stream, strongly influencing water quality in the littoral zone over distances >1km from the stream mouth and constraining sediment and nutrient flux to the pelagic zone. The nutrient limitation status of phytoplankton varied both temporally and spatially within the lake in relation to nutrient transport processes and, potentially, variation in assemblage composition and environmental history. The occurrence of active processes that caused net removal (e.g. deposition) or accumulation (e.g. resuspension) of nutrients and sediments in the water column was characterized by comparing concentrations of suspended sediments and dissolved nutrients measured in the transition zone with concentrations estimated assuming only conservative mixing between the stream and the lake. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the transition zone were generally diluted by the stream, although hot spots' (approximate to 10-30m wide) of high concentrations occurred in the nutrient-rich plume on a day when phytoplankton at a pelagic site were nutrient limited. This study highlighted how characteristics of littoral-pelagic coupling can influence fine-scale spatial and temporal variations in the water quality of large lakes.

The purpose was to examine spatial variation of surface temperatures within GOES pixels (approximately 48 km2) using nested HCMM pixel surface temperatures. The areas in the Florida peninsula used for comparison ranged over 3.degree. of latitude and included dry pine forests, pastures, and crops and moist wetlands and lakes. Temperature means and standard deviations were calculated for the HCMM pixels nested in each GOES pixel for comparison. Standard deviations were plotted against mean surface temperatures for an area in central Florida of about 1900 km2 and another area in southern Florida which was three times larger. The standard deviations of HCMM pixel (0.22 km2) temperatures associated with mean temperature of a GOES pixel (about 48 km2) temperature during this winter nocturnal period were smallest for homogeneous water surfaces (about 0.5 K) and slightly larger for homogeneous land surfaces (about 1.0 K), but ranged up to as high as 3.5 K for mixed water-land surfaces. Standard deviation vs. mean temperature curves of pixels nested in larger areas can characterize the homogeneity vs. inhomogeneity of a large area.																			0034-4257	1879-0704				APR	1987	21	3					341	353		10.1016/0034-4257(87)90017-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(87)90017-4													WOS:A1987G747300007

As a consequence of high nutrient loading, most of the reservoirs experienced cyanobacterial blooms of various intensities, with the prevalence of cyanobacteria increasing markedly in August, along with a conspicuous shift in species composition toward dominance of Microcystis spp. Microcystins were detected in 90% of the samples, and their amount also increased considerably in August, reflecting the cyanobacterial biomass. In Microcystis-dominated samples, a significantly higher amount of MCs (p < 0.001) occurred than in samples in which other taxa prevailed. Microcystins were positively correlated with chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial biovolume (p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.61 and 0.66, respectively), with the strongest correlation found for Microcystis spp. biovolume (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.87). This taxon was the most important producer of MCs in Czech reservoirs. The main structural variants of MCs were MC-LR, MC-RR, and MC-YR. This study's data also indicate that the relative share of MC variants (MC-LR and MC-RR) varies considerably with time, most likely as a consequence of different species and strain compositions during the summer. This study clearly demonstrates a high prevalence of MC-producing cyanobacteria in Czech reservoirs. Therefore, regular monitoring of these reservoirs is highly desirable in an effort to minimize potential health risks to the human population.

It is held that the close of the spring period of increase in not directly due to light or temp. nor is it due to grazing, lack of P, N, C or Ca. It is often due to lack of silica. Occasionally it is due to competition with other diatoms which become dominant when the nos. of Asterionella are depressed by fungal parasitism. Large growths of diatoms do not occur at silica concns. of less than approx. 0.5 mg. SiO2 per l. P and Ca can be stored in the cells in excess of immediate requirements. Phosphate P can be utilized when its concn. in the water is l [gamma] per l. or less. The amt. of silica per unit area of cell is constant. Limitation of growth due to lack of silica differs from that due to lack of light.

J	Chen, SQ; Nan, Q; Ma, S; Sun, YH				Chen, Shengqian; Nan, Qi; Ma, Shuai; Sun, Yuanhao			Spatial heterogeneity of Holocene hydroclimatic variation in Asian drylands based on lake salinity records	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												The Asian drylands, spanning the East Asian monsoon region (EAM), arid Central Asia (ACA), and arid West Asia (AWA), constitute one of the world's most ecologically vulnerable and climate-sensitive zones. This vast region is not only critical for understanding past climate dynamics but also represents a pivotal component of the ancient Silk Road. Previous studies, leveraging diverse proxy records, numerical simulations, observational data, and reanalysis datasets, have identified asynchronous hydroclimatic variations between the ACA and EAM on decadal to sub-orbital timescales during the Holocene. However, when incorporating hydroclimatic variations in the AWA, our understanding of the spatial patterns of climate change across the entirety of the Asian drylands remains fragmented. This knowledge gap hampers a comprehensive understanding of the temporal and spatial characteristics of climate change and the underlying mechanisms driving these dynamics. Moreover, it limits our ability to explore the fundamental regional responses to climate and environmental changes under varying atmospheric circulation systems. Bridging this gap is essential for reconstructing the interconnected hydroclimatic evolution of the Asian drylands and enhancing predictive frameworks for future climate scenarios in these vulnerable regions. Endorheic lake salinity serves as a sensitive proxy for regional hydroclimatic shifts, directly reflecting changes in lake water balance. In this study, we applied rigorous data selection criteria to compile 20 high-resolution lake salinity records from the Asian drylands. By integrating these records with paleoclimate simulations, we conducted the first spatially explicit synthesis of hydroclimatic variations across the Asian drylands during the Holocene. Our findings reveal striking spatial heterogeneity in lake salinity trends, with divergent hydroclimatic trajectories across key regions. The EAM and AWA regions exhibited lower lake salinity during the mid-Holocene, followed by significant increases in the late Holocene. In contrast, the ACA displayed the opposite trend, with progressively declining salinity throughout the Holocene. To disentangle the driving mechanisms, we compared lake salinity records with precipitation and effective moisture outputs from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4). In the EAM, a strengthened East Asian summer monsoon during the mid-Holocene enhanced precipitation and reduced lake salinity, whereas a weakened monsoon in the late Holocene led to drier conditions and higher salinity. Conversely, in ACA, the increasing intensity of westerlies over the Holocene resulted in a gradual rise in precipitation, which corresponded to declining lake salinity. Intriguingly, despite both ACA and AWA being influenced by westerlies, their hydroclimatic responses diverged. Our analysis suggests that AWA's distinct variability stemmed from amplified subtropical high-pressure systems, driven by enhanced spring insolation. This mechanism suppressed moisture transport and intensified atmospheric subsidence, reducing spring precipitation and establishing a unique hydroclimatic regime in the region. Overall, our results reveal a tripole pattern of Holocene hydroclimatic variations across the Asian drylands. Lake salinity records align closely with precipitation and effective moisture variations derived from paleoclimate simulations, highlighting the critical role of regional climate dynamics.

Photochemical rate modelling is used to determine sunlight-induced CO2 emissions on large spatial and temporal scales. A sensitive model parameter is the wavelength-specific photochemical CDOM reactivity, the apparent quantum yield (AQY). However, the temporal variability of AQY spectra within inland waters remains poorly constrained. Here, we studied a boreal brown water lake in Sweden. We measured AQY spectra for photochemical DIC production monthly between June and November 2014 and parameterised a photochemical rate model. The total AQY between 280 and 600 nm increased about 3-fold during the open-water period, likely due to a high rainfall event with consecutive mixing in autumn that increased availability of highly photoreactive CDOM. However, the variability in AQY spectra over time was much smaller than previously reported variability in AQY spectra between lakes. Yet, using either the AQY spectrum from the least or from the most photoreactive water sample resulted in a 5-fold difference in simulated annual DIC photoproduction (2012-2014), with 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 10.3 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. This corresponded to 1 and 8% of the mean CO2 emissions measured from this lake. We conclude that (1) it may be recommendable to conduct repeated AQY measurements throughout the season for more accurate simulation of annual photochemical DIC production in lakes and (2), in agreement with previous studies, direct CDOM photomineralisation makes only a minor contribution to mean CO2 emissions from Swedish brown water lakes.					; Natchimuthu, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011	Groeneveld, Marloes/0000-0003-4505-4224; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/0000-0002-9058-3048; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	13					3931	3943		10.5194/bg-13-3931-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-3931-2016													WOS:000381099900007

Measured zooplankton clearance rates ranged from 0-25 ml(-1) h(-1) on phytoplankton to 0-33 ml l(-1) h(-1) on bacterioplankton. The highest rates were found during the summer when Daphnia spp. were dominant. As the phytoplankton biomass was substantially greater than that of bacterioplankton throughout the study period, ingestion of phytoplankton was 26-fold greater than that of bacterioplankton. Multiple regression analysis of the experimental data revealed that Daphnia spp., Bosmina longirostris and Cyclops vicinus, which were the dominant zooplankton, all contributed significantly to the variation in ingestion of phytoplankton, while only Daphnia spp. contributed significantly to that of bacterioplankton. Using estimated mean values for clearance and ingestion rates for different zooplankters, we calculated zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and bacterioplankton on the basis of monitoring data of lake plankton obtained during a 9 year study period. Summer mean grazing ranged from 2 to 4% of phytoplankton production and 2% of bacterioplankton production to maxima of 53 and 88%, respectively. The grazing percentage decreased with increasing density of planktivorous fish caught in August each year using gill nets and shore-line electrofishing. The changes along a gradient of planktivorous fish abundance seemed highest for bacterioplankton. Accordingly, the percentage contribution of bacterioplankton to the total ingestion of the two carbon sources decreased from a summer mean value of 8% in Daphnia-dominated communities at lower fish density to 0.7-1.1% at high fish density, when cyclopoid copepods or Bosmina and rotifers dominated. Likewise, the percentage of phytoplankton production channelled through the bacteria varied, it being highest (5-8%) at high fish densities. It is argued that the negative impact of zooplankton gazing on bacterioplankton in shallow lakes is highest at intermediate phosphorus levels, under which conditions Daphnia dominate the zooplankton community.

To deepen the understanding on the microclimate regulation function of an urban wetland, this study analyzed the influence of a suburb wetland's urbanization process on the local climate through contrast observations of the protected wetland area and the former wetland area in Xixi wetland. Results show that the urbanization of suburb wetlands has an impact on the local microclimate and decreases human comfort, and that wetlands can effectively regulate the microclimate. The fragmentation of urban wetlands caused by urban sprawl decreases their microclimate regulation function, a decrease that is particularly evident in summer. Additionally, wetlands stabilize the microclimate in all seasons. For every land cover type in wetlands, vegetation has a better stabilizing effect on temperature, whereas a water body has a better stabilizing effect on wind speed and humidity. Meteorological conditions also affect the microclimate regulation function of wetlands. Temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed influence the cooling function of urban wetlands, while solar radiation modifies the humidifying function of urban wetlands.						zhang, wei/0000-0001-9029-7319; Jiang, Jingang/0000-0001-5511-8485														2071-1050				SEP	2016	8	9							885	10.3390/su8090885	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8090885													WOS:000385529400057

Limited influence of a wind power project submarine cable on a Laurentian Great Lakes fish community	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Previous research has identified the generation of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emanating from renewable energy project transmission cables to be a potential stressor to aquatic communities. In this study, we investigated whether the presence of a high voltage submarine transmission cable affected the spatial pattern and composition of nearshore and offshore fishes at a Laurentian Great Lakes site. The transmission cable investigated in this study runs 7.8km along the lakebed of Lake Ontario, carrying electricity from the Wolfe Island wind power project to the city of Kingston, Ontario. In autumn of 2011, both nearshore electrofishing and deeper-water fisheries acoustic surveys were conducted along transects at varying distances to the cable. For both habitat types, no detectable effects of the cable on the fish community were found. Local habitat variables, including substrate or depth, were more important in explaining variation in fish density than proximity to the cable. Common species encountered during the surveys were round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the nearshore and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in the deeper channel. American eel (Anguilla rostrata), thought to be an electromagnetically sensitive species, was also encountered during the surveys including in close proximity to the cable. More robust impact assessments require sampling fishes before a cable installation, over greater time frames (additional seasons or years), and habitats that support more diverse native assemblages.

Data from downcore pollen analysis (including pollen and spores from both aquatic vegetation, and terrestrial herbaceous, arboreal and shrub vegetation), modern vegetation monitoring and existing climate scenarios have been combined to provide a picture of the ecological changes in the pond over the last 13,600 years. Downcore pollen analysis throughout the last 13,600 years indicated the presence of species typical of Mediterranean Temporary Pond (MTP) habitats and suggested relatively drier conditions towards the present. The low number of non-native, cultivated species (such as herbaceous Trifolium and Plantago species) observed over this period suggested relatively low impact from crop agriculture, despite the increasing grazing pressure in the area. In the absence of independent proxies, we cannot reliably distinguish between natural and human-induced changes. The presence of aquatic Isoetes in the palaeo-record indicates the existence of an ephemeral pond in the area as early as the beginning of the Holocene suggesting resilience of the ecosystem over time. However, the degraded state of pollen in depths over 55 cm (i.e. 3600 year BP) increases the uncertainty of the interpretation. Currently, the pond holds 76 plant species belonging to 25 families. Therophytes and chamaephytes were the most frequent, suggesting a typical ephemeral habitat life form spectrum. Species richness was found to increase during spring surveys whereas the highest turnover was observed between summer surveys of consecutive years. Cluster analysis demonstrated a distinct zonation in four vegetation belts from the periphery to the centre of the pond which is typical of these environments. Modelling, based on two IPPC scenarios (A2 and B2), predicted relatively low climate change impacts on the pond's hydroperiod for the next 100 years (i.e. a decrease of 16 and 24 days, respectively). This reduction in the hydroperiod of the pond will have an effect on the physiognomy and spatial extent of vegetation, particularly for the transitional belts between the core and its outer area, while it will exert more pressure on the pond as a water resource for sheep in the region. However, cumulative effects and complex interactions of climate-driven environmental changes and other anthropogenic disturbances might act synergistically to accelerate impacts in the future.					; Ghosn, Dany/AAL-9131-2020; Vogiatzakis, Ioannis/J-6986-2013; Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011; Zacharias, Ierotheos/R-9672-2017; Maliaka, Valentini/AGC-7710-2022	Ghosn, Dany/0000-0003-1898-9681; Vogiatzakis, Ioannis/0000-0001-7071-6950; Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897; Zacharias, Ierotheos/0000-0001-8410-6862; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2010	648	1					3	18		10.1007/s10750-010-0143-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0143-9													WOS:000277284000002

J	Odhiambo, BK; Boss, SK				Odhiambo, BK; Boss, SK			Integrated echo sounder, GPS, and GIS for reservoir sedimentation studies: Examples from two Arkansas Lakes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Bathymetric and sedimentation surveys were conducted using a dual frequency (28/200 kHz) echo sounder system in two reservoirs (Lee Creek Reservoir and Lake Shepherd Springs) in the Ozark Plateau of northwestern Arkansas. Echo sounder survey data were merged within geographic information system (GIS) software to provide detailed visualization and analyses of current depths, pre-impoundment topography, distribution, thickness, and volume estimates of lacustrine sediment, time averaged sediment accumulation rates, long term average annual sediment flux, and water storage capacity. Calculated long term average sediment accumulation rates were used to model sediment infilling and projected lifetimes of each reservoir. Results from echo sounder surveys and GIS analyses suggest that the Lee Creek Reservoir has a projected lifetime of approximately 500 years compared to a projected lifetime for Lake Shepherd Springs of approximately 3,000 years. Estimated differences in projected lifetimes of these reservoirs reflected differences in initial reservoir volume and long term average annual sediment flux from the respective watersheds related to watershed area, physiography, land cover, and land use. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) model generated sediment fluxes an order of magnitude larger from the watersheds of both reservoirs compared to the geophysical data estimates. This study demonstrated the utility of merging geophysical survey (echo sounder) data within a GIS as an aid to understanding patterns of reservoir sedimentation. These data and analyses also provide a baseline relevant to understanding sedimentation processes and are necessary for development of long term management plans for these reservoirs and their watersheds.

Late Quaternary paleoclimate of western Alaska inferred from fossil chironomids and its relation to vegetation histories	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Fossil Chironomidae assemblages (with a few Chaoboridae and Ceratopogonidae) from Zagoskin and Burial Lakes in western Alaska provide quantitative reconstructions of mean July air temperatures for periods of the late-middle Wisconsin (similar to 39,000-34,000 cal yr B.P.) to the present. Inferred temperatures are compared with previously analyzed pollen data from each site summarized here by indirect ordination. Paleotemperature trends reveal substantial differences in the timing of climatic warming following the late Wisconsin at each site, although chronological uncertainty exists. Zagoskin Lake shows early warming beginning at about 21,000 cal yr B.P., whereas warming at Burial Lake begins similar to 4000 years later. Summer climates during the last glacial maximum (LGM) were on average similar to 3.5 degrees C below the modern temperatures at each site. Major shifts in vegetation occurred from similar to 19,000 to 10,000 cal yr B.P. at Zagoskin Lake and from similar to 17,000 to 10,000 cal yr B.R at Burial Lake. Vegetation shifts followed climatic warming, when temperatures neared modern values. Both sites provide evidence of an early postglacial thermal maximum at similar to 12,300 cal yr B.R These chironomid records, combined with other insect-based climatic reconstructions from Beringia, indicate that during the LGM: (1) greater continentality likely influenced regions adjacent to the Bering Land Bridge and (2) summer climates were, at times, not dominated by severe cold.

The lake is sheltered from winds, and the role of waves in mixing the water column is minimal. Eutrophication favours the strengthening of stratification. Early warm springs cause a fast stagnation of the water column forming partly meromictic conditions. Seston content of water and in sediment traps in 3 layers was measured several times during the formation of stratification. Besides measuring particulate matter, in 2001, the nutrient content of the trapped sediment was analysed. During the first 7 days of the investigation, 30% of the total particle sedimentation took place. The sedimentation rate of particulate matter was 0.4-6.3 g m(-2) d(-1) dry weight in different layers of the water column. Daily average sedimentation loss rate was 27% of the total amount of seston of the epilimnion, whilst from the meta- and hypolimnion the settling was much slower (9.6 and 7.3%, respectively ). In our experiments with twin sediment traps, to one of which formaldehyde was added, the 4 concentration was 19% smaller in the trap without formaldehyde, probably due to planktonic uptake. The relationship between primary and export production is loop-like. The shape was irregular, indicating a high grazing rate of zooplankton.					; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020	Ott, Ingmar/0000-0002-9036-1736; 													0018-8158					SEP 15	2005	547						51	61		10.1007/s10750-005-4143-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4143-0													WOS:000232760300006

We conclude that summer pejerrey anglers differed by lakes in their motivations, preferences, and economic valuation of their fisheries and that most of the differences were attributed to travel distance, facilities, and quality of the fishery. We surveyed four fisheries located in different geographical areas, assessing preference and motivation by interviewing boat anglers at access points and then applying the contingent value method to assess economic values under current and different management conditions. (greater catch or larger size). Results indicated that anglers considered factors other than catching fish to be important, and a continuum of preferences and motivations was observed on a regional basis. Economic analysis yielding expenditures for study lakes averaged US$ 126,000. Consumer surplus for current conditions averaged 30% greater than actual trip costs. Under the preferred management option for the better fishing (greater catch or larger size, depending on the lake), average consumer surplus increased 65% over current expenditures, to US $208,000 per lake. The combination of socio-economic information representing non-market goods with traditional biological and fishery data will provide more comprehensive management criteria to achieve sustainable pejerrey fisheries in Pampean lakes.					; Colautti, Darío/AAV-4732-2020	Baigun, Claudio/0000-0001-8412-8586; 													1040-2381					SEP	2003	19	3					242	250		10.1080/07438140309354089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354089													WOS:000185811900006

Soil water was intensively sampled from within the soil organic layers as well as above (shallow soil water) and within (deep soil water) a compact basal till. Stream SiO2 concentrations of the high-elevation basin 47 were the same as the levels found in shallow soil water, and forest-floor percolate SiO2 concentrations were elevated to these levels during intense melting periods. The SiO2 concentrations from the stream and the shallow an deep soil water were similar at the low-elevation basin 31. With the exception of deep soil water, water collected from the soil and stream at basin 47 had higher H+ and Al and lower base cation concentrations than basin 31. Stream Al concentrations were significantly correlated with forest-floor percolate Al concentrations at the high-elevation basin, whereas stream Al concentrations were correlated with mineral soil water Al concentrations at the low-elevation site. There were significant positive correlations between stream and shallow soil water H+ at both basins. Shallow soil water pathways, therefore, were an important contributor to streamflow, and influenced stream chemical response during the spring snowmelt at TLW.																			1432-9840					SEP	2001	4	6					527	535		10.1007/s10021-001-0026-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-001-0026-z													WOS:000171620400004
J	Guildford, SJ; Hecky, RE; Verburg, P; Albert, A				Guildford, Stephanie J.; Hecky, Robert E.; Verburg, Piet; Albert, Anathea			Phosphorus limitation in low nitrogen lakes in New Zealand	INLAND WATERS												Lakes on volcanic soils of the North Island of New Zealand, compared to north temperate lakes, have low total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios, low dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations during summer stratification, and have positive chlorophyll a responses to N additions more frequently than to P in nutrient enrichment bioassays. This response has resulted, in some cases, to the imposition of N loading caps on some lake catchments, in contrast to nutrient management in north temperate lakes focused more on P management. To explore this possible difference in limiting nutrients, a suite of nutrient status indicators based on measurement of ambient seston stoichiometry and metabolic activity, which have been widely used in north temperate lakes, were applied to 8 lakes on volcanic terrain with previously reported N limitation. These nutrient status measurements were previously calibrated to inform whether in situ phytoplankton are growth-rate limited and, if so, which nutrient is limiting growth rate. In austral summer 2015, all 8 lakes showed indications of P limitation, and P limitation was more extreme, pervasive, and persistent (among samplings) than N limitation. Indications of N limitation were not observed without contemporaneous evidence of P limitation, but P limitation was frequently observed without evidence of N limitation. One lake, Rotorua, was not strongly nutrient limited, and phytoplankton were likely growing at or near optimum growth rates. In this study the commonly used TN:TP ratio was a poor predictor of which nutrient was potentially limiting in situ phytoplankton.						verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2022	12	2					261	276		10.1080/20442041.2021.2015994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.2015994		MAR 2022											WOS:000770455200001

The main task of this study is to reveal the interdecadal variation features of summer atmospheric circulation over Asian mid-high latitudes in recent decades. The results show that the atmospheric circulation over mid-high latitudes of Asia has stronger interdecadal fluctuations than that over low latitudes and one significant change center appears near Lake Baikal. It is found that the atmospheric circulation near Lake Baikal has a significant interdecadal change around 1996 and a deep anomalous anticyclonic circulation has been controlling this region since then, which contributes to the significant increase in the surface temperature near Lake Baikal since 1997 and makes the region a remarkable warming center in Asia in recent 40 years. During 1997-2015, the pattern of less precipitation in the north and more precipitation in the south of east China is closely related to the anomalous anticyclonic circulation near Lake Baikal. Especially, this anomalous circulation near Lake Baikal has been found to contribute to the obvious interdecadal decrease of the precipitation in northeast China and north China near 1997. The sea surface temperature (SST) of northwestern Atlantic is an important influence factor to the interdecadal change in the atmospheric circulation near Lake Baikal around 1996.					; qi, dongmei/NYT-4516-2025	Li, Di/0000-0003-4404-1739; 													1006-8775					SEP	2020	26	3					363	376		10.46267/j.1006-8775.2020.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.46267/j.1006-8775.2020.032													WOS:000573414400010

We conducted a two-year field study of five impoundments in western and central Pennsylvania to determine if seasonal zooplankton density was related to first year survival of stocked walleye larvae. Using sampling methods that could be easily replicated by state fisheries management agencies, we assessed the magnitude and timing of spring zooplankton blooms in relation to first-year survival of stocked walleye larvae. Our findings showed that although zooplankton production may vary widely among study waters and across years, fry survival was highest when the combined density of large-bodied clasdocerans and adult copepods exceeded 100 organisms/L. When peak zooplankton densities were less than 100/L, few walleye fry survived.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2006	21	1					121	129		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2006.9664104													WOS:000235415800016

The hy- drochemistry and lithium isotopes (87Li) of water and solid samples along the Nalenggele River catch- ment were studied in combination with rock leaching experiments. The results showed the hot springs in the upstream contained high content of lithium and ratio of Li x 1 000/total dissolved solids (1.5- 3.5), but the lower 87Li values (4.33 parts per thousand-11.59 parts per thousand), meaning that it is one important lithium sources. The leaching experiments by the rich-lithium volcanic rocks (average content of 474.7 mg/kg) showed that under temperature of 20-80 degrees C and long time duration (24-96 h), the concentration of lithium released by leaching of the sampled volcanic rocks increased from 0.58 to 1.49 mg/L, with the leaching rate de- creasing from 0.024 to 0.015 mg/(L.h) and the corresponding lithium release rate increasing from 29% to 74%. Calculation based on water-salt balance showed that the total amount of lithium contribution from hydrothermal fluids and volcanic rock weathering is about 4.99 and 0.29 Mt since 13.1 ka, respec- tively. Therefore, hot springs and leaching of volcanic rocks are main contributors to lithium deposit in DXTSL.					; Jiang, Hongchen/Y-9471-2018	Han, Jibin/0000-0001-6426-9015; Jiang, Hongchen/0000-0003-1271-7028													1674-487X	1867-111X				AUG	2023	34	4			SI		1083	1094		10.1007/s12583-022-1802-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-022-1802-2		MAR 2023											WOS:000957431300001

Here we report the late Holocene climate change in the northern plateau by using a 3490-year sediment core record from Kusai Lake. Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) collected from the core were examined in combination with other paleo-environmental proxies. The reconstructed mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) using branched GDGT (membrane lipids of certain bacteria) proxies are higher than the measured MAAT, but much closer to measured summer air temperatures, suggesting a possibility of a bias of the reconstructed MAAT towards summer temperatures. The pH values derived from a branched GDGT proxy show a negative correlation with TOC (a lake productivity indicator in arid regions). Furthermore, both CBT-pH and TOC show temporal cyclic changes, which suggest that the branched GDGT derived pH index may be useful in reconstructing paleo-pH values in a lacustrine system. Lastly, the composition of isoprenoid GDGTs (membrane lipids of archaea) shows a major shift around 1400 BP, which is in line with a large increase in sediment soluble salts at this time, but lags behind the onset of salt mineral precipitation by 600 yr, suggesting that change in archaeal community composition and salt mineral precipitation may require different threshold values of salinity. The results of this study demonstrate that useful paleo-climatic and paleo-environmental information can be extracted from the GDGTs preserved in lake sediments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most biodiversity assessment-related studies use the change in species abundance data to measure the level of biodiversity conservation. Yet for many areas, long-term species data are not available and thus it is necessary to use biodiversity indices to monitor the effect of land use (LU) changes or the impact of protected area establishment. Poyang Lake wetland is one of the most important wintering sites for migratory water birds on the East Asian-Australasian flyway. To protect this habitat, 14 nature reserves were created in the region between 1997 and 2003. This paper aims to assess the effect of nature reserve creation on the status of habitat for overwintering water birds in Poyang Lake wetland by analysing LU and land cover data from 1995, 2005 and 2015. We developed a composite biodiversity index to search for current biodiversity hotspots (conservation priority) in the study area. An integrated approach consisting of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model, GIS, fragment analysis and hotspot analysis was used to realize our objective. Our results showed that the creation of the nature reserve had positive effects on overwintering water bird habitat. However, tremendous changes (such as change of habitat area, quality and fragmentation) within and outside the nature reserve showed that the role of protected area still needs to be further discussed. Moreover, regional synthesis LU management plans such as ecological restoration should be carried out. The results of the habitat assessment also indicate that a comprehensive biodiversity index framework based on net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality could be more efficient in assessing biodiversity and defining a reasonable protected area, from data obtain in large scale perspective.					; Li, Peng/LBV-0429-2024; Chen, Cheng/GZK-6593-2022; König, Hannes/I-1964-2012	Hemminger, Karoline/0000-0003-1321-2224; Konig, Hannes J./0000-0002-4980-7388; Chen, Cheng/0000-0003-1318-2854; Li, Peng/0000-0002-0849-5955; 													1748-9326					DEC	2020	15	12							125013	10.1088/1748-9326/abc6d0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc6d0													WOS:000600071400001
J	Lou, MY; Li, C; Hao, SF; Liu, J				Lou, Maoyuan; Li, Chao; Hao, Shifeng; Liu, Juan			Variations of Winter Precipitation over Southeastern China in Association with the North Atlantic Oscillation	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												The synoptic-scale winter precipitation variations over southeastern China (22A degrees-32A degrees N, 105A degrees-125A degrees E) and their association with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during 1951-2007 are investigated in this paper. The variability of wintertime precipitation is characterized by meridional displacement of its maximum center. Two precipitation regimes, with maximum centers located over the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, are identified via cluster analysis. Time-lagged analyses suggest that the two precipitation regimes are connected with the decaying phases of positive NAO (NAO+) events of different amplitudes. A strong (medium) NAO+ event is defined as one when the maximum amplitude of the NAO index exceeds 1.0 (in the range of 0.7-1.0) for at least 4 consecutive days and drops to less than 0.3 within 7 days following the peak index. After the peak of a strong NAO+, southerly winds expand northward to the Yangtze River (about 30A degrees N), a northeast-southwest-tilted trough migrates to east of Lake Baikal, and cold air intrudes into central eastern China; thus, precipitation is strengthened over the Yangtze River basin where warm and cold air masses converge. In comparison, during the decaying phase of medium NAO+ events, the southerly winds are relatively weak, and precipitation tends to be enhanced at lower latitudes (around 25A degrees N). Further analysis indicates that downstream Rossby-wave propagation may account for the latitudinal expansion of the southerly wind anomalies over the eastern coastal area of China during the decaying phase of NAO+ events of different strengths.																			2095-6037	2198-0934				JUN	2017	31	3					476	489		10.1007/s13351-017-6103-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-017-6103-9													WOS:000404630000003

Fall diet and bathymetric distribution of deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii) in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii are an important component of Great Lake's offshore benthic food webs. Recent declines in deepwater sculpin abundance and changes in bathymetric distribution may be associated with changes in the deepwater food web of Lake Huron, particularly, decreased abundance of benthic invertebrates such as Diporeia. To assess how deepwater sculpins have responded to recent changes, we examined a fifteen-year time series of spatial and temporal patterns in abundance as well as the diets of fish collected in bottom trawls during fall of 2003, 2004, and 2005. During 1992-2007, deepwater sculpin abundance declined on a lake-wide scale but the decline in abundance at shallower depths and in the southern portion of Lake Huron was more pronounced. Of the 534 fish examined for diet analysis, 97% had food in the stomach. Mysis, Diporeia, and Chironomidae were consumed frequently, while sphaerid clams, ostracods, fish eggs, and small fish were found in only low numbers. We found an inverse relationship between prevalence of Mysis and Diporeia in diets that reflected geographic and temporal trends in abundance of these invertebrates in Lake Huron. Because deepwater sculpins are an important trophic link in offshore benthic food webs, declines in population abundance and changes in distribution may cascade throughout the food web and impede fish community restoration goals.

We sought to determine the distribution and prevalence of infection of snails per agro-ecological zone and environmental factors in vector snail habitats. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from March, 2016 - May, 2016, harvested and identified snails using shell morphology, determined their infection with trematode cercariae using microscopy, used descriptive statistics to estimate the prevalence of infection and relationship between snail abundance and environmental factors. Results: We sampled a total of 1,678 vector snails from 47 sampling sites of which 42% were Lymnaeid, 23% Biomphalaria, 10% Bulinus, 22% Oncomelaniae and 2% Melanoides. Lower Midland I Ago-Ecological Zones had 44% of the snails and streams from springs had 41% of the snails. Overall, 26.5% (445/1678) (95% CI: 24.4 - 28.6) of the snails shed cercariae. Cercariae were found in 11 (23%) of the sites and in all zones. F. gigantica cercariae were shed by L. natalensis; B. pfeifferi, B. sudanica. Lakeshore had both F. gigantica and S. mansoni cercariae shed by B. sudanica. About 72% (1,202/1,678) of snails were found in water with a pH 6.5 - 7.5. Grass habitat had 54% (912/1,678) of the snails. Conclusion: Lymnaeid snails were present in all the zones, while streams from springs and near neutral habitats had most of the snails. Infection with trematode cercariae was noted in all the zones. Trematodiases control should be focused on all zones especially in freshwater streams and lakeshores.

Temperature change as a driver of spatial patterns and long-term trends in chironomid (Insecta: Diptera) diversity	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Anthropogenic activities have led to a global decline in biodiversity, and monitoring studies indicate that both insect communities and wetland ecosystems are particularly affected. However, there is a need for long-term data (over centennial or millennial timescales) to better understand natural community dynamics and the processes that govern the observed trends. Chironomids (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are often the most abundant insects in lake ecosystems, sensitive to environmental change, and, because their larval exoskeleton head capsules preserve well in lake sediments, they provide a unique record of insect community dynamics through time. Here, we provide the results of a metadata analysis of chironomid diversity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. First, we analyse spatial trends in chironomid diversity using Northern Hemispheric data sets overall consisting of 837 lakes. Our results indicate that in most of our data sets, summer temperature (T-jul) is strongly associated with spatial trends in modern-day chironomid diversity. We observe a strong increase in chironomid alpha diversity with increasing T-jul in regions with present-day T-jul between 2.5 and 14 degrees C. In some areas with T-jul > 14 degrees C, chironomid diversity stabilizes or declines. Second, we demonstrate that the direction and amplitude of change in alpha diversity in a compilation of subfossil chironomid records spanning the last glacial-interglacial transition (similar to 15,000-11,000 years ago) are similar to those observed in our modern data. A compilation of Holocene records shows that during phases when the amplitude of temperature change was small, site-specific factors had a greater influence on the chironomid fauna obscuring the chironomid diversity-temperature relationship. Our results imply expected overall chironomid diversity increases in colder regions such as the Arctic under sustained global warming, but with complex and not necessarily predictable responses for individual sites.					; Nazarova, Larisa/C-8926-2014; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Porinchu, DF/S-4360-2019; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Quinlan, Roberto/0000-0002-6691-795X; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Nazarova, Larisa/0000-0003-4145-9689; Porinchu, David/0000-0002-0495-3082; Engels, Stefan/0000-0002-2078-0361; Axford, Yarrow/0000-0002-8033-358X; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2020	26	3					1155	1169		10.1111/gcb.14862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14862		NOV 2019						31596997					WOS:000493661500001

More than 850,000 inhabitants of the city of Arequipa and the Colca valley are concerned by further activities of those volcanoes. The aim of the current study is to complete the Holocene tephrostratigraphical model for southern Peru in which about 40 tephras are distributed within the past 50,000 years. The tephras described in this paper have been discovered in two sites: the large peat-bog of Sallalli at the southern piedmont of the Sabancaya volcano, and the Laguna Mucurca, a salar (brine lake) 15 km W of Nevado Ampato. The Sallalli peat-bog is located in a glacially shaped Piedmont, which has been dammed by recent moraines and lava flows 10 km SE of the summit of Nevado Sabancaya. The peat section, which spans a large part of the Holocene period (since ca. 9650 yr), encompasses at least five tephras. The most recent ones consist in plinian ash-falls caracterized by rhyolitic glass shards that can be linked either with the AD 1600 eruption of the Huaynaputina volcano (120 km to the ESE) or with an eruption of the Misti volcano (60 km to the SE) that occurred between 800 cal BC and 200 cal AD. The other tephras consist in phreotomagmatic products of local origin likely erupted by the Sabancaya volcano, or by the Ampato volcano, within the periods bracketed as follows: (i) 150 cal AD and 100 cal BC; (ii) 150 and 420 cal BC; (iii) 2100 and 2500 cal BC; and (iv) 7420 et 7750 cal BC. The recent lacustrine deposits of the Laguna Mucurca host traces of a plinian ash-fall from Huaynaputina volcano and a scoriaceous tephra of phreatomagmatic origin. The latter was emplaced between 920 and 760 cal BC. This tephra has probably been produced by one of the neighbouring cones located in the field of monogenic volcanoes close to Huambo on the southern edge of the Rio Colca valley.					; Rivera, Marco/E-9124-2012	Marino Salazar, Jersy Raphael/0000-0002-7337-894X; Rivera Porras, Marco Antonio/0000-0003-4339-9296													1142-2904					JUN	2008	19	2					157	173																WOS:000256860500008

Bayesian Analyses of 17 Winters of Water Vapor Fluxes Show Bark Beetles Reduce Sublimation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Sublimation is an important hydrological flux in cold, snow-dominated ecosystems. In high-elevation spruce-fir forests of western North America, spruce beetle outbreaks have killed trees, reduced the canopy, and altered processes that control sublimation. We evaluated two hypotheses related to effects of disturbance on sublimation in this ecosystem: (1) the dominant source for sublimation is canopy intercepted snow and (2) the loss of canopy following a beetle disturbance leads to less total sublimation. To incorporate uncertainty hierarchically across multiple data sources and address phenomenological parsimony, Bayesian statistics were used to analyze 17years (2000-2016) of winter eddy covariance flux data at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Sites AmeriFlux sites where a spruce beetle outbreak caused 75-85% basal area mortality. Our analysis revealed that resistances to sublimate snow from the canopy were an order of magnitude less than from the snowpack, and the maximum snow loading capacity in disturbed canopies was reduced to 34% of its pre-outbreak value. Total sublimation has decreased since 2010, 2years after the main outbreak, declining 24% (with a 95% credible interval, C.I., between 18% and 38%) during 2014-2016 due to a 32% decrease in canopy sublimation. Snowpack sublimation only increased 3% over this period. With less total sublimation, the forest retained 6.1% (4.5-12.3% C.I.) more snowpack mass or equivalently 4.4% (3.2-8.8 C.I.) of the annual precipitation. Considering tree growth and ecological succession are slow in spruce-fir forests, this decrease in sublimation should persist as an increased snowpack for decades, with substantial impacts on catchment hydrologic processes and potentially streamflow.

J	Woolf, TE; Madsen, JD				Woolf, TE; Madsen, JD			Seasonal biomass and carbohydrate allocation patterns in southern Minnesota curlyleaf pondweed populations	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Four southern Minnesota populations of curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.) were sampled monthly from January 2001 to November 2002 to determine seasonal phenological, biomass, and carbohydrate allocation patterns. Low periods of carbohydrate storage in the seasonal phenological cycle indicate potentially vulnerable periods in the plant's life cycle and may be the ideal time to initiate management and control efforts. Samples were separated into shoots, roots, inflorescence, and turions and then dried. Biomass (g m(-2)) and percent total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) were determined for each plant component. Total biomass peaked in May and June, and ranged from 122 to 190 g m(-2). Turion formation and flowering were observed to coincide with peak biomass. Peak turion TNC concentrations ranged from 44 to 66%. The low point of carbohydrate storage in all four lakes occurred between January and April 2002, indicating that early spring may be the best time to initiate management.																			0146-6623					JUL	2003	41						113	118																WOS:000188371900008

Lake Erie summer chlorophyll phenology: a Bayesian additive regression trees comparison of growth and decay phases	WATER RESEARCH												Synergistic effects of abiotic and biotic factors determine chlorophyll, a proxy for algal biomass in lakes. With harmful algal blooms (HABs) increasingly threatening water quality, it is important to determine the extent to which lake abiotic conditions contribute to chlorophyll that generally exhibits a growth phase leading to a summer peak followed by a decay phase. Here an ensemble-tree model implemented in the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) was used to investigate the effects of seven potential drivers on chlorophyll concentrations during both growth and decay phases in western Lake Erie in the years 2012-2022. Our findings revealed that total phosphorus (TP) consistently emerged as the dominant driver, exhibiting a positive saturating relationship. During growth, interactions between TP and nitrogen forms dominated, while beam attenuation emerged as the central interacting variable during decay phase. The TP-chlorophyll relationship was similar between the growth and decay phases of the bloom. Overall, while the TP-chlorophyll relationship is well established in freshwater lakes, the fact that TP emerges as the most important factor in an exploration that includes other nutrients, temperature, and light underscores the idea that management strategies focused on phosphorus control should be effective in reducing HABs in Lake Erie.

The paper provides an analysis of data obtained over the period from 2010 to 2022. The studies were carried out under both the background conditions and the extreme natural conditions associated with severe wildfires in Siberia. The parameters of the lidars used in regular summer expeditions to Lake Baikal are briefly described. The data analysis shows that the vertical structure of the aerosol in the lower troposphere up to 2000 m above Baikal in summer is often a stable structure of several aerosol layers tens to hundreds of meters thick. There can be no mixing of layers because the water in the lake is very cold and the aerosol does not rise to higher layers while the air is warming up during the day. The difference is shown between the spatiotemporal structures of aerosol plumes from local wildfires within the lake area and from distant sources. The Angstrom parameter and the aerosol optical depth are calculated for different atmospheric conditions: & eta;(& beta;) = 1.57 & PLUSMN; 0.16 and & tau; = 0.09 for background conditions; & eta;(& beta;) = 1.41 & PLUSMN; 0.07 and & tau; = 0.64 for the cases of the observation of smoke aerosol from distant wildfires; and & eta;(& beta;) = 1.05 & PLUSMN; 0.08 and & tau; = 0.25 for the cases of the observation of smoke aerosol from nearby wildfires.

Seasonal distribution and activity of nitrogen-cycling bacteria in Bardawil Lagoon, Egypt	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The ecological significance of Bardawil Lagoon, the only oligotrophic hypersaline lagoon on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, was assessed through studying counts, activities and the distribution of nitrogen-cycling bacteria. Counts and activities of ammonifying bacteria, ammonium-oxidising microbes (AOM) and nitrite-oxidising bacteria (NOB) were compared between sites colonised by macrophytes and bare sites. Microbial counts and activities, and the concentrations of both organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds, were higher at colonised sites. In late summer, as macrophytes started to die off, organic nitrogen content in the sediments increased, mineralisation of the organic nitrogen in the sediments was pronounced, and ammoniacal-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N concentrations peaked. Counts of ammonifying bacteria, AOM and NOB were also at maximum during the same period, coinciding with the highest ammonification and nitrification rates.						, Magdy/0000-0002-6291-4938													1608-5914	1727-9364				AUG	2009	34	2					183	188		10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.9.896	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.9.896													WOS:000269753500009

We investigated sex-related differences in roost-site selection by Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii in their summer habitat in central Germany. We studied whether the location of and landscape structure around nine nursery roosts and seven male-only roosts differed during the nursery period (15 May-31 July). Roosts were located by radio-tracking, and animal numbers and group composition were obtained by trapping and counting at roosts. Landscape structure was evaluated by a GIS-based habitat analysis. 2. Marked variation in animal numbers was observed both in nursery roosts (range: 6-144 individuals) and male roosts (range: 1-51 individuals). The surroundings of nursery and male roosts varied significantly in the proportion of areas belonging to different landscape elements. The areas covered by ponds, lakes and rivers, as well as the area covered by coppices were larger in the surroundings of nursery roosts. Moreover, nursery roosts lay closer to a river and at lower altitudes than male roosts. Male Daubenton's bats used more distant foraging sites than gravid or lactating females. 3. The differences in roost-site location between the two sexes are suggestive of intraspecific competition for access to productive foraging areas in the surroundings of the summer roosts, with females being dominant over males. We assume that breeding females defend climatically favourable areas with good food supply in order to increase the survival of their offspring.

Lake Ledro is interesting because its own dimensions are suited for LES and it is surrounded by complex orography, affecting wind distribution. We consider the winter condition when stratification is nearly absent. Two types of time-varying wind stress are used: spatially homogeneous and spatially inhomogeneous respectively. The analysis of the eddy viscosities shows substantial differences with respect to the ocean case characterized by absence of coastal boundaries and homogeneous, steady wind. The quantities exhibit a noticeable inhomogeneous behavior: the horizontal eddy viscosity is larger in the water body far from the boundaries, whereas the vertical one is larger close to the lateral boundaries due to the presence of a boundary layer. The energetic bottom boundary layer, typically occurring in lakes, is not present. This because of the intrinsic unsteadiness of the thermal wind blowing over the lake and due to the absence of large amplitude internal waves, the latter present only in case of stable stratification. In the inhomogeneous wind case, up-welling and down-welling areas are not confined along the shoreline only, but are also generated in the water body due to substantial horizontal velocity divergence, and turbulent mixing, quantified by eddy viscosities, TKE and its dissipation rate, appears enhanced with respect to the homogeneous wind case. Finally, downwelling/upwelling areas along the windward/leeward coastline respectively were observed, whose quantitative estimation may give explanation for the bloom of cyanobacteria at the lake surface observed in winter.					; Toffolon, Marco/D-4845-2011; Giovannini, Lorenzo/A-5468-2015	santo, marco antonio/0000-0003-4189-2714; Toffolon, Marco/0000-0001-6825-7070; Giovannini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1650-0344; armenio, vincenzo/0000-0002-2945-9152; Zanier, Giulia/0000-0001-5047-2362													2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2017	122	6					4704	4722		10.1002/2016JC012284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC012284													WOS:000407088800013
J	Finn, CA; Morgan, LA				Finn, CA; Morgan, LA			High-resolution aeromagnetic mapping of volcanic terrain, yellowstone National Park	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												High-resolution aeromagnetic data acquired over Yellowstone National Park (YNP) show contrasting patterns reflecting differences in rock composition, types and degree of alteration, and crustal structures that mirror the variable geology of the Yellowstone Plateau. The older, Eocene, Absaroka Volcanic Supergroup, a series of mostly altered, andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks partially exposed in mountains on the eastern margin of YNP, produces high-amplitude, positive magnetic anomalies, strongly contrasting with the less magnetic, younger, latest Cenozoic, Yellowstone Plateau Group, primarily a series of fresh and variably altered rhyolitic rocks covering most of YNP. The Yellowstone caldera is the centerpiece of the Yellowstone Plateau; part of its boundary can be identified on the aeromagnetic map as a series of discontinuous, negative magnetic anomalies that reflect faults or zones along which extensive hydrothermal alteration is localized. The large-volume rhyolitic ignimbrite deposits of the 0.63-Ma Lava Creek Tuff and the 2.1-Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, which are prominent lithologies peripheral to the Yellowstone caldera, produce insignificant magnetic signatures. A zone of moderate amplitude positive anomalies coincides with the mapped extent of several post-caldera rhyolitic lavas. Linear magnetic anomalies reflect the rectilinear fault systems characteristic of resurgent domes in the center of the caldera. Peripheral to the caldera, the high-resolution aeromagnetic map clearly delineates flow unit boundaries of pre- and post-caldera basalt flows, which occur stratigraphically below the post-caldera rhyolitic lavas and are not exposed extensively at the surface. All of the hot spring and geyser basins, such as Norris, Upper and Lower Geyser Basins, West Thumb, and Gibbon, are associated with negative magnetic anomalies, reflecting hydrothermal alteration that has destroyed the magnetic susceptibility of minerals in the volcanic rocks. Within Yellowstone Lake, which is mostly within the Yellowstone caldera, aeromagnetic lows also are associated with known hydrothermal activity in the lake. Many of the magnetic lows extend beyond the areas of alteration and hot springs, suggesting a more extensive currently active or fossil hydrothermal system than is currently mapped. Steep magnetic gradients, suggesting faults or fractures, bound the magnetic lows. This implies that fractures localize the hot springs. Magnetic gradient trends reflect the mapped Basin and Range structural trends of north and northwest, as well as northeasterly trends that parallel the regional trend of the Snake River Plain and the track of the Yellowstone hot spot which follow the Precambrian structural grain. These trends are found both at small scales such as in hydrothermal basins and at more regional fault scales, which suggests that the regional stress field and reactivated older structures may exert some control on localization of hydrothermal activity.

J	WALLEN, DG				WALLEN, DG			PHOTOHETEROTROPHY AND DARK HETEROTROPHY IN ICE-COVERED LAKE ST CLAIR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Both light and dark uptake of glucose carbon by the microplankton in ice-covered Lake St. Clair were measured several times over the winter period, from December to March. Heterotrophic potential (V max) were consistently and significantly higher in the light (ranging from 3.9-10.7 nM glucose L-1 h-1) than in the dark (2.5-5.2 nM glucose L-1 h-1). Respiratory release of glucose carbon ranged from 0.27 to 2.28 times higher in the dark than light. Vertical profiles of photosynthesis and heterotrophy on 21 January and 20 February indicated that photoheterotrophic carbon uptake ranged from 8% of photosynthetic assimilation just below the ice to 60% in the lower euphotic zone, ranging from 125.0-158.3 and 90.6-298.1 ng C L-1 h-1 on 21 January and 20 February, respectively. Dark uptake in the aphotic zone ranged from 87.5-133.3 and 99.9-257.3 ng C L-1 h-1 on 21 January and 20 February, respectively. Total assimilation of glucose carbon in the water column ranged from 29% to 36% of total carbon assimilated photosynthetically. Under the harsh winter conditions of low irradiation and temperature the mechanisms of photoheterotrophy and dark heterotrophy may be ecologically important in augmenting reduced photosynthetic production.																			0380-1330						1990	16	3					339	345		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71428-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71428-1													WOS:A1990EB97200002

Temperature Proxies as a Solution to Biased Sampling of Lake Methane Emissions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lake emissions of the climate forcing trace gas methane (CH4) are spatiotemporally variable, but biases in flux measurements arising from undersampling are poorly quantified. We use a multiyear data set (2009-2017) of ice-free CH(4)emissions from three subarctic lakes obtained with bubble traps (n = 14,677), floating chambers (n = 1,306), and surface concentrations plus a gas transfer model (n = 535) to quantify these biases and evaluate corrections. Sampling primarily in warmer summer months, as is common, overestimates the ice-free season flux by a factor 1.4-1.8. Temperature proxies based on Arrhenius functions that closely fit measured fluxes (R-2 >= 0.93) enable gap filling the colder months of the ice-free season and reduce sampling bias. Ebullition (activation energy 1.36 eV) expressed greater temperature sensitivity than diffusion (1.00 eV). Resolving seasonal and interannual variability in fluxes with proxies requires similar to 135 sampling days for ebullition, and 22 and 14 days for diffusion via models and chambers, respectively.

At the three experimental stations the values of V-max of APA were higher and the negative correlation between orthophosphate and the total APA specific activity (V-max/Chl.) was stronger during summer (from June to September) P depletion. At the same time, the values of Michaelis constant (K-m) of APA at the three stations decreased. Phytoplankton seem to compensate for their phosphorus deficiency not only by an increase in enzyme production but also by an improved ability to use low substrate concentrations.

Assessment of Available Tools for Monitoring Wheat Midge (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana Gehin, is an invasive pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae) throughout Canada and the United States.The applicability of available monitoring tools, including sex-pheromone baited traps, yellow sticky cards, and soil core sample surveys, in the northern-most agroecosystem of its invasive range has not been assessed. In this study, the attraction of male wheat midge to two Delta traps (green and orange) baited with one of three pheromone lures (a flex lure and two red septa lures from different sources) were compared.The efficacy of three yellow sticky cards (7 x 12 cm, 14 x 18 cm, and 14 x 18 cm rolled into a cylinder) for capture of male and female midge was assessed. Larvae were extracted from wheat heads sampled at the same sites to determine relationships with earlier adult trap capture. More male adult midges were captured in pheromone-baited traps with a greater surface area and in traps baited with the Scotts flex lure than the Great Lakes IPM septa lure, which had higher and more variable pheromone release rates.The smaller yellow sticky cards captured more male and female midges than the larger yellow sticky cards, regardless of shape.The number of female midges captured on yellow sticky cards predicted the number of larvae in wheat heads.The number of male midges captured in pheromone-baited traps did not predict larval density. Relationships were found between the number of overwintering cocoons recovered in soil core samples and emerging midges the following spring.					; Evenden, Maya/A-2635-2014; jorgensen, amanda/MCH-4583-2025	jorgensen, amanda/0000-0001-7707-6378; Evenden, Maya/0000-0003-0333-7330; 													0046-225X	1938-2936				JUN	2020	49	3					627	637		10.1093/ee/nvaa017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa017								32181822					WOS:000544155800013

Since then it has been found in the water column nearly every summer, initially at low concentrations, but since 2003 it formed major summer blooms. The goals of the present study were to identify the invading species based on its morphology, annual life cycle, toxicity, genetic markers, and its phylogeny, and to examine its range of morphological variability. Cell counts, allometric measurements, and filament morphology were determined on samples collected weekly from a mid-lake station throughout 2005. Akinetes, heterocytes, filament end types, cellular contents, and the annual cycle of filament morphology were described, supporting the identification as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya et Subba Raju. Cells had many small, few large, or no dark granules presumed to be polyphosphate bodies. Filament fragmentation was observed and six types of filament ends were described. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and ITS-L DNA fragment from a laboratory isolate of the cyanobacterium also confirmed the identification as C. raciborskii. Biomass of this species collected from Lake Kinneret during a bloom did not show toxicity in Artemia bioassays, and the toxin cylindrospermopsin was not detected in a methanolic extract of the isolate. Genetic examination indicated that C. raciborskii from Lake Kinneret lacked the cyrJ component of the cylindrospermopsin synthase cluster and, thereby, was incapable of producing the toxin. Due to the morphological plasticity of this species, the identification of C. raciborskii from Lake Kinneret was not straight forward and required taking multiple approaches, including microscopic observations over a full annual cycle, culture isolation, and molecular taxonomy.																			0018-8158					FEB	2010	639	1					115	128		10.1007/s10750-009-0044-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0044-y													WOS:000273447500011

The Li-B-rich salt lakes on the TP basically follow the basic pattern: recharge from hot springs-carrying and transporting by rivers-enrichment and mineralization in terminal salt lakes. Currently, most of the studies focus on the geothermal-salt lake resources in the southern TP, and there are fewer comparative studies on the Li-B enrichment mechanisms in the geothermal-salt lakes of different orogenic zones in the northern TP. The major resource bases for formation and utilization of Li resources in China are the brine-type Li deposits in the central salt lakes of the Qaidam Basin (QB), which are recharged by the geothermal water from East Kunlun Mountains (EK). The solid-liquid B deposits in the Da Qaidam Salt Lake (DQL) are replenished by the geothermal water from the southern Qilian Mountains (SQL). This study elucidates systematically the Li-B enrichment mechanism in the geothermal systems of the EK and SQL on the northern TP. Based on the analysis of geochemical data of the elemental contents and H-O-Li-B isotopes in geothermal water, river water, salt lake and surrounding rocks of the TP, the following conclusions are reached: (1) The Cl content of the two geothermal waters and H-O isotopes of the brines of the terminal salt lakes indicate that the geothermal waters of the EK and SQL geothermal systems are mixed by meteoric and magma water. (2) There are significant differences in the Li-B concentrations of the hot spring water and brine of the terminal salt lakes in the two geothermal systems located in the north and south orogenic belts of the QB. The EK hot spring water enriched in Li-B (Li=96mg/L, B=180mg/L), while the SQL hot spring harbors high B (B=41.54mg/L, average Li=3.18mg/L). The Li concentrations of the intercrystalline brines in Yiliping, Dong-Xitaijinaier and Qarhan salt lakes (122.91 similar to 447.07mg/L) are obviously higher than that of the DQL (Li=117.00 similar to 187.00mg/L), while the opposite occurred in the B content of the DQL (513.00 similar to 706.00mg/L). (3) Comparison of the relationship between the geologic background of the TP and Li-B in geothermal waters and salt lakes reveals that Li-B in the geothermal system of the TP is controlled by magmatism and metamorphism during orogeny. The Li-rich granites (igneous rocks) widely spread in the EK constrained the Li content of the hot springs in Bukadaban Peak, and the HP-UHP B-rich metamorphic rocks formed by the Qilian Mountain orogenic movement constrained the B content in the DQ hot springs. (4) Low Li (< 1mg/L)-high delta Li-7 (+29.45 parts per thousand) for meteoric water and high Li (928x10(-6)similar to 34, 851x10(-6))-low delta Li-7 (-3.39 parts per thousand similar to+7.55 parts per thousand) for pegmatites around the EK geothermal system are responsible for the Li cycling process of geothermal water and salt lakes. Low B (< 1mg/L)-high delta B-11 (+16.69 parts per thousand) for meteoric water and high B (32, 000x10(-6)similar to 35, 000x10(-6))-low delta B-11 (-9.86 parts per thousand similar to+3.75 parts per thousand) tourmaline (metamorphic rocks) of the DQ geothermal system constrains B cycling process on the geothermal water and salt lakes. The Li-B in the geothermal water and terminal salt lakes of the two geothermal system are mainly derived from leaching from the host rock reservoirs. This study provides a source-transport-sink enrichment model for understanding the mineralization of geothermal water-terminal salt lake resources on the TP, which can reversely be a reference for tracing the mineralization of rocks in orogenic belt (hard rock lithium or B-rich rocks) through the variations in Li-B contents of geothermal waters.

Hence, identification of primary drivers of animal population decline is a priority for conservation. Analyzing long time-series data is a powerful way to assess drivers of declines, but the data are often missing, hampering effective conservation policymaking. In this study, based on twenty-four years (from 1996 to 2019) of annual maximal count data, we investigated the effects of climate and landscape changes on the increasing population trend of the Greater White-Fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) at a Ramsar site in the Middle and Lower Yangtze Floodplain, China. Our results showed that the availability of a suitable habitat and landscape attributes are the key driving forces affecting the population trend, while the effects of climate factors are weak. Specifically, increasing the area of suitable habitat and alleviating habitat fragmentation through a fishing ban policy may have provided a more suitable habitat to the geese, contributing to the increasing population trend. However, we also observed that the grazing prohibition policy implemented in 2017 at Shengjin Lake may have potentially negatively affected geese abundance, as grazing by larger herbivores may favor smaller geese species by modifying the vegetation community and structure. Based on our results, we suggest several practical countermeasures to improve the habitat suitability for herbivorous goose species wintering in this region.

J	Liu, XQ; Dong, HL; Rech, JA; Matsumoto, R; Bo, Y; Wang, YB				Liu Xingqi; Dong, Hailiang; Rech, Jason A.; Matsumoto, Ryo; Bo, Yang; Wang Yongbo			Evolution of Chaka Salt Lake in NW China in response to climatic change during the Latest Pleistocene-Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Late Pleistocene and Holocene hydrologic balance of Chaka Salt Lake in the eastern Qaidam Basin of NW China was studied based on the analysis of lithostratigraphy, mineralogy, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen from a 9.0-m long sediment core. An age-depth model for the lake sediments is based on eight accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 measurements of organic matter and a 1700-year radiocarbon reservoir correction. The Pitzer model was used to calculate the sequence of minerals precipitated as a function of salinity assuming that the initial lake water was recharged from adjacent rivers and springs. Lake salinity values were derived from a good match between the calculated and observed mineral sequences. Our multi-proxy based hydrologic reconstruction of Chaka Lake indicates that it was a clastic-dominated, freshwater lake between 17.2 and 11.4 cal ka BP, which may have resulted from the input of glacial water into the lake at that time. During the Lateglacial and Holocene, a warm climatic regime predominated between 13.9 and 12.7 cal ka BP and then a cold climatic regime prevailed between 12.7 and 11.4 cat ka BP. These warm and cold periods correlate with the Bolling-Allerod and Younger Dryas events in the region. Beginning at 11.4 cal ka BP, a saline or hypersaline lake developed, which may have resulted from increased summer insolation and temperatures. These conditions persisted throughout the Holocene. Modeling indicates that lake salinity fluctuated between 66 and 223 ppt from 11.4 to 7.2 cal ka BP and then increased to 223-322 ppt between 7.2 and 6.0cal ka BP, when most regions of China recorded high moisture availability (i.e. the so-called "mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum"). Lake salinity decreased to 66-223 ppt during a short time period between 6.0 and 5.3 cal ka BP, possibly caused by reduced evaporation. Subsequently, salinity values rapidly increased to 223-322 ppt between 5.3 and 5.2 cal ka BP and a hypersaline take with a salinity higher than 324 ppt, similar to modern Chaka Salt Lake, became established around 5.2 cal ka BP. This establishment may have been related to the weakening of Asian monsoon. Regional comparisons of paleoclimatic records indicate that large temporal and spatial variations exist in the occurrence and intensity of drought over Western China since the Lateglacial.

The core provides a 3700-year record of human activity and environmental change in an upland region. We attempt to relate vegetation changes to both climatic change and historical events. Variations of anthropogenic pollen indicators Suggest several phases of intensified human activities. Two strongly expressed agricultural phases are dated at about 2450-2220 cal BP (Achaemenid Empire) and 230-30 cal BP (collapse of Safavid Dynasty to the modern period). Historical rather than climatic events appear to be the main controlling factors for upland land-use dynamics. Fruticulture has been practiced in the region at least since the Iron Age, reaching its maximum importance 1500-1250 cal BP during the reign of Sassanid Empire; it: declined by the time of Islamic conquest of Iran (651 AD). The Little Ice Age is tangibly recorded by higher lake water levels most probably due to both lower summer temperatures and higher annual precipitations. Low values of cereal-type and cultivated tree pollen during this period may indicate a change in the lifestyle from the cultivation of fields and orchards to a more nomadic life dominated by Summer pasture. The modern period (1850 AD onwards) is characterized by expansion of agricultural activities to upland areas and intensified pastoralism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	MACHENA, C; KAUTSKY, N; LINDMARK, G				MACHENA, C; KAUTSKY, N; LINDMARK, G			GROWTH AND PRODUCTION OF LAGAROSIPHON-ILICIFOLIUS IN LAKE KARIBA - A MAN-MADE TROPICAL LAKE	AQUATIC BOTANY												Two different methods, the diurnal oxygen curve method in plexiglass enclosures, and the incremental growth technique were used to complement production estimations of Lagarosiphon ilicifolius Oberm. in Lake Kariba. The incremental growth technique gave a production rate of 16.4 mg g-1 dry weight (DW) day -1 (7.5 mg C g-1 DW day -1) which was 6.5 times higher than the rate of 1.16 mg C g -1 DW day -1 obtained for the community from the diurnal oxygen curve method. The difference is largely accounted for by the total respiration of the community, which is inherent to the enclosure technique, and also by the fact that the measurements were carried out for short periods of time. Using the production rate from growth measurements, the biomass production of Lagarosiphon was calculated as 1.6 g DW m-2 day -1 and to 598.6 g m-2 year -1. The average community P/R ratio of 1.16 indicates that the community is operating close to steady-state, and shows a high degree of self maintenance. Lagarosiphon has an annual turnover rate of 2.4 but the populations are perennial (i.e. grow all year round). The main growing season is in summer, from October to February. Cohorts that develop during the summer, branch extensively at the end of this growth period, and while occluding light to the bottom, die off in the process. The resulting drifting mats fragment and constitute the major reproductive modules. Although flowering was observed, sexual reproduction does not appear to be important. It is concluded that the difference in the production values between the community taken as a whole and individual plants reflects the role different components of the ecosystem play in the metabolism of the macrophyte community. For this reason the value of 16.4 mg g-1 calculated from marked individuals is a more realistic growth rate of Lagarosiphon plants in this study.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				JUN	1990	37	1					1	15		10.1016/0304-3770(90)90060-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(90)90060-X													WOS:A1990DN25600001

Late Holocene Vegetation Dynamics and Sea Level Fluctuations: A High-Resolution Record from Southeast India	QUATERNARY												A detailed high-resolution study of climate and vegetation changes in two sedimentary profiles from the Godavari delta in India was conducted to understand extreme climate variability over the last 3000 years. These historical climate records are vital for predicting future climate changes influenced by increased human activity. Pollen records reveal several climatic periods: (1) an initial warm/humid phase (2260-1560 cal yr BP) with mangrove and tropical tree pollen and maximum pollen accumulation rate (PARmax), (2) a gradual shift to drier conditions with reduced mangrove and arboreal pollen, coinciding with to the Dark Ages Cold Period (1580-1070 cal yr BP), (3) a Medieval Warm Period (1090-580 cal yr BP) marked by a stronger summer monsoon, rejuvenation of mangroves and tree pollen, (4) a relatively cool and dry phase with abundant dry deciduous and non-arboreal pollen possibly linked to the Little Ice Age (580-80 cal yr BP), showing a weakened monsoon, and (5) recent warming since 80 cal yr BP. A semi-quantitative aridity, temperature, and moisture index based on pollen concentration variations have also been used to identify centennial-scale climatic cycles in the pollen record.

The middle Miocene Horse Spring Formation and red sandstone unit allow for detailed stratigraphic, chronostrati-graphic, and structural analysis for better understanding the geologic history of extension in this region. We present new data from the White Basin and Lovell Wash areas (Nevada) to interpret the evolution of faulting, basin fill, and paleogeography. We conclude that tectonics strongly influenced sedimenta-tion and hypothesize that climate may have played a secondary but important role in creating stratigraphic variations. Deposited from 14.5 to 13.86 Ma, the microbialitic Bitter Ridge Limestone Member of the Horse Spring Formation, the stratigraphically lowest unit in this study, records a widespread shallow and uniform lake which had moderate and steady sedimentation rates, both of which were controlled by a few faults. The persistent lake was broken up by fault reorganization followed by deposition of the highly variable fluvial-lacustrine facies of the Lovell Wash Member from 13.86 to 12.7 Ma. During this time, faulting shifted from the northeast-trending, oblique normal left-lateral White Basin fault to the northwest-trending, normal Muddy Peak fault and other smaller northwest-trending faults. The lower and middle portions of the red sandstone unit, 12.7-11.4 Ma, record an increase in the sedimentation rate of basin fill near the Muddy Peak fault as well as the return to widespread lacus-trine conditions. Sedimentation and faulting slowed during deposition of the uppermost red sandstone unit, but some deformation occurred post-11.4 Ma. This study records basin-fill evolution including variations in depositional environments laterally and vertically, documents changes in the location and magnitude of faulting, supports earlier work that hypothesized faulting pro-ceeded in discrete westward steps across the Lake Mead area, and helps constrain the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the region.

Data on thermal features of these lakes are sparse, which hinders our understanding of the possible ecosystem impacts of the warming climate and climate feedbacks at larger spatial scales. We investigated spatial-temporal variations of lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) in 12 Arctic lakes in north-west Finnish Lapland and explored the predominant drivers of LSWTs by continuous year-round observations. The lake surface temperature data were recorded using thermistors at bi-hourly resolution during the years 2000, 2007-08 and 2019-2021. A large regional heterogeneity was observed in the timing of the maximum and minimum LSWTs and the overall patterns of the annual cycle. Our results reveal that July air temperature, maximum lake depth and altitude explained most of the variance in the summer LSWT (> 85%). The remaining variance was related to geographic location (longitude and latitude), lake morphometric features, such as lake area and catchment area, and certain physico-chemical characteristics, such as Secchi depth and dissolved organic carbon content. Our results provide new insights into thermal responses of different types of small Arctic lakes to climate change.					; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Heikkila, Maija/N-7659-2013; Heikkilä, Maija/N-7659-2013; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013	Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Zhang, Mingzhen/0009-0004-8864-0412; Heikkila, Maija/0000-0003-3885-8670; Weckstrom, Kaarina/0000-0002-3889-0788; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X													0800-0395	1751-8369				AUG 8	2024	43								9580	10.33265/polar.v43.9580	http://dx.doi.org/10.33265/polar.v43.9580													WOS:001318657400001

They are difficult to characterise due to their complex, partly glaciokarstic, evolution in active tectonic environments, and an unsaturated zone up to two kilometres thick. We present and discuss the results of a tracing test in the alpine karst of the Julian Alps (Slovenia), more precisely in the Migovec System, the longest cave system in Slovenia (length = 43 km, depth = 972 m). The cave extends below a mountain ridge that separates the So & ccaron;a and Sava Valleys, thus forming a topographic divide between the Adriatic and Black Sea basins, which gives the test greater regional significance. In early September 2019, three kilograms of uranine were injected into a perched lake in a remote part of the system, approximately 900 metres below the plateau and 100 metres above the low water table. All known springs in the valleys on either side of the mountain were monitored by manual or instrumental sampling and a field fluorometer. Due to the unexpectedly dry season, no tracer was detected at any site for two months until a heavy rainfall event in early November. Subsequently, about 60-65 % of the tracer mass appeared within 60 hours in the Tolminka River. No tracer was detected at other sites, either because it was not present or because it was highly diluted. The study suggests that the lake containing the tracer is bypassed by the vadose flow and that the tracer was only mobilised during large events when the lake became part of the epihreatic flow. The linear peak flow velocity from the injection site to the Tolminka Spring was only about 1.7 m/h. However, assuming that the tracer was only mobilised by the large rain event, the velocity would be 70 m/h. The study highlights the challenges and pitfalls of water tracing in alpine karst systems and suggests ways to avoid them.

The birds were heavily encrusted with sodium sulfate crystals. Dead birds that were necropsied had aspirated lake water and had evidence of acute muscle degeneration. The live geese (155) were captured and moved to nearby freshwater wetlands where most apparently survived. Some birds died of severe myopathy after translocation. Five northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) were found encrusted with salt and unable to fly on the lake approximately 10 days later. Salt encrustation apparently occurred when rapid cooling of the lake resulted in supersaturation and crystallization of the dissolved salt.

During the assessment surveys, no dead lake trout were recovered in April-June, one was recovered in August, and 27 were recovered in October or November, implying that most mortality from causes other than fishing occurred in the fall. The estimated numbers of dead lake trout between the 30- and 100-m depth contours in U.S. waters ranged from 16,000 (0.08 carcass/ha) in 1983 to 94,000 (0.46 carcass/ha) in 1982. Of 76 carcasses fresh enough to enable recognition of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) wounds, 75 bore fresh wounds. Assuming that sea lamprey wounding rates on dead fish were the same as on live ones of the same length range (430-740 mm), the probability of 75 of the 76 dead lake trout bearing sea lamprey wounds was 3.5 .times. 10-63 if death was independent of sea lamprey attack, thus strongly implicating sea lampreys as the primary cause of death of fish in the sample. The recovery of only one unwounded dead lake trout also suggested that natural mortality from causes other than sea lamprey attacks is negligible.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1988	45	8					1406	1410		10.1139/f88-164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-164													WOS:A1988P807100009

Liver RNA-DNA indicated a longer summer growth depression in fish collected from the smaller, shallower lake. Although LSI were consistently higher in the smaller, shallower lake, liver RNA/DNA and scale analyses showed faster growth rate in the larger, deeper lake. The LSI is a useful indicator of relative food intake-energy storage levels within a single lake, but it does not necessarily reflect absolute growth rate of the fish. Liver RNA/DNA provided an indication of immediate or short-term growth rates.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1978	107	6					799	803		10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<799:COTBPB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<799:COTBPB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1978GF96200007

FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Net nitrifying activity of epiphytic biofilms was examined on the submersed macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum in the Danube River floodplain Kopacki Rit. Macrophytes were collected monthly during the summer 2003. Nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured after incubation of shoots of different age in the inorganic synthetic media with ammonia salt as the sole source of nitrogen. The net nitrifying activity was significantly higher during the end of the summer, only on the mature shoots. The concentration of both nitrites and nitrates was significantly higher. Consequently, spatial differences in the net nitrifying activity emerged between the shoots of different age. It seems that physical and chemical environment were not the cause of the established differences, as the macrophytes were developed in the vicinity and within the same environmental conditions. Spatial distribution of the net nitrifying activity coincided with the establishment of filamentous epiphytes well-developed only on the mature shoots. Epiphytes probably enhanced the net nitrifying activity by providing new colonization surface. Beside the effect of the new surfaces on the nitrification, the results suggest that it is in relation to the environmental concentration of organic matter.

J	George, DG				George, D. G.			The impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the development of ice on Lake Windermere	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Windermere, the largest lake in England, seldom freezes over but the sheltered bays are usually covered with ice for several days every year. Here I analyse the meteorological factors influencing the development of ice on the lake between 1933 and 2000 and relate these to the regional and global changes in the weather. The results demonstrate that the methods used to describe the development of ice at high latitudes can also be used to predict the formation of ice on this temperate lake. The best indicator of change was the number of ice-days recorded every winter. Regression analyses based on a Poisson model showed that there were significant negative correlations between the number of ice-days and the local air temperature, the Central England Temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI). The relationship with the NAOI was particularly pronounced and explained 50% of the observed inter-annual variations. A hindcasting model based on the NAOI correctly predicted the most severe winters reported in the area between 1864 and 1910. The observed and predicted numbers of ice-days were also correlated with an index of sea ice in the Baltic. The results demonstrate that the number of ice-days reported on Windermere can be used as a proxy indicator of climate change and show that the NAO has had a major effect on the development of ice on this lake for at least a hundred and thirty years.																			0165-0009					APR	2007	81	3-4					455	468		10.1007/s10584-006-9115-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-006-9115-5													WOS:000244686900011

It thrives in shallow sheltered areas, where it is impacting native fauna. In Denmark, researchers, governmental institutions and fishers have joined in an effort to establish a sustainable round goby fishery. To do so, basic information about the movement of round goby is essential, so the movements of 50 round gobies were tracked using acoustic telemetry. The results revealed that activity took place mainly at night and seasonal migrations were common. The most frequent migration behaviour observed was a seaward return migration during winter, which was further confirmed by a snorkel survey. Tracking data also revealed riverine upstream dispersal. The results demonstrate that the round goby can be mapped using telemetry, and it is suggested that fishing for round goby may improve efficiency by targeting seasonal migration corridors.

Here, we present a new lake-level record from a closed-basin lake in northern China and a compilation of available lake level records from closed-basin lakes located at the northern margins of East Asian and Indian monsoon regions. These data show that ca. 6 ka ago, changes in water availability, as recorded by the surface areas of the closed-basin lakes, shrunk dramatically, within a few decades, and have not been restored to their pre-6 ka sizes since. These data imply that the Indo-East Asian monsoon systems underwent a large coeval southward contraction, which preceded the gradual decline in insolation forcing, and abruptly ended the Holocene Humid Period (HHP). This new compilation enables to constrain potential feedback mechanisms involved in the early termination of the HHP at the monsoon fringes.

As a sensitive area to climate change, mastering the spatial and temporal changes of summer LST in the Bosten Lake basin (BLB) helps gain insight into the evolution of the thermal environment in the Bosten Lake basin and for long-term monitoring of the basic ecological changes in the basin. Based on MOD11A1 data from 2005 to 2020, this paper investigates the diurnal LST spatiotemporal series variation and its influencing factors in the Bosten Lake basin by using surface temperature class classification, trending analysis, the Hurst index, and geographic probes. The results show that (1) the wetland grasslands in and around the Bayinbruck steppe in the northwestern part of the study area exhibit a heat island effect during the day, while the opposite is true at night. In terms of temporal changes, LST changes in the BLB fluctuate widely, having a general rising and then decreasing trend. (2) The decreasing trend of LST from 2005 to 2020 is significant during the daytime and vice versa at night, and the change at night is greater than during the day. The areas with significantly higher diurnal LST in the future have all expanded compared to the area occupied by them now, with an overall trend of a steady increase. (3) The dominant factor of LST variation has the strongest explanatory power when altitude and NDVI are combined during the daytime and the strongest explanatory power when NPP and temperature are combined at night.					; liang, hongwu/GYQ-6665-2022; Kasimu, Alimujiang/GRJ-2729-2022	zhang, xueling/0000-0001-9202-9764; Kasimu, Alimujiang/0000-0003-0468-6559; Liang, Hongwu/0000-0001-7766-0291; aizizi, yimuranzi/0000-0002-2449-2447; 														2073-445X				JUN	2023	12	6							1185	10.3390/land12061185	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12061185													WOS:001015074700001

Autonomous profiling device to monitor remote water bodies	CURRENT SCIENCE												In tropical climates, most freshwater reservoirs, dams and lakes are prone to annual summer stratification during which bottom water layers near the bed become hypoxic (<2 ml/l) with very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO). This has serious implications to human health, and requires frequent and effective monitoring, particularly during summer months (March May) when water consumption is highest. These water bodies are frequently located in remote areas away from human habitation, making it logistically difficult to access and monitor their water column properties on a regular basis. The need for monitoring temporal changes in freshwater ecosystems is addressed in this note through the description of a patented technology Autonomous Vertical Profiler. (AVP) designed and developed at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, for use in both coastal and freshwater bodies. The AVP was used in experiments to satellite transmit complete time and location referenced high-resolution profiles of temperature, phytoplankton concentration, turbidity and DO from the remote Tillari Dam a freshwater reservoir near Dodamarg, Maharashtra, India. The profiles were received without errors at the Marine Instrumentation Laboratory at NIO. The benefits of in situ time-series profiling with AVP captured the onset of developing hypoxia in early April 2011 over a 9-day unsupervised profiling experiment. A similar 5-day experiment in February 2011 tracked diurnal changes in phytoplankton concentrations through night and day, suggesting a possible interplay between recycled production and photoinhibition.																			0011-3891					JAN 25	2012	102	2					169	176																WOS:000299857300013

We examined the stomach contents of 162 S. glanis and 547 S. lucioperca specimens sampled along two years from four different stations in the dam reservoir. Both species were found to feed mainly on teleost fishes, with the cyprinids Sarmarutilus rubilio and Scardinius erythrophthalmus as the main preys. One species of crustacean and insect larvae were found to be occasionally consumed. The comparison of vacuity index revealed differences only between juveniles and adults of S. lucioperca collected in the upstream station during winter.

Quantifying the changing pattern of water level conditions and groundwater potential zones in a rapidly urbanizing Kamrup metropolitan district of Assam, India	GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												The identification and management of groundwater resources are critical for sustainable development since there is an increase in demand for groundwater use. Geospatial remote sensing approaches are vital to groundwater resource evaluation and conservation. We studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use change between 2000 and 2020 and its impact on water level conditions and groundwater potential zones in a rapidly urbanizing Kamrup metropolitan district of Assam, India. The thematic maps, such as land use and land cover (LULC) in 2000 and 2020, geology, geomorphology, topsoil sand, topsoil clay, and slope, were used to define groundwater potential zones. The analytical hierarchy process was used to quantify the weight, rank, and reclassification of various thematic maps. The assigned weights of LULC, geology, geomorphology, topsoil sand, topsoil clay, and slope were 70%, 14%, 4.6%, 4.6%, 4.6%, and 2.2%, respectively. The groundwater potential zone classified as "good" has decreased in cumulative area by 19% during the study period. The increase in the "very good" groundwater potential zone is primarily associated with conservation of lakes and other surface water bodies. Urbanization is the primary driver for decreased groundwater potentiality in the study region. Shallow (<2 m below ground level, bgl) groundwater levels are associated with "good" groundwater potential zones, whereas intermediate (2-5 m bgl) groundwater levels are associated with "moderate" groundwater potential zones. Groundwater levels in built-up areas are showing falling trends, except in a few places where the water levels are rising, which suggests a lack of monsoonal recharge due to increased imperviousness. Without sustainable planning, the change in groundwater potential zones and a falling trend in the depth to water levels could threaten the lives of people in this region.																			2352-801X					MAY	2023	21								100935	10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100935		MAR 2023											WOS:000967105400001

Climate warming and vegetation response after Heinrich event 1 (16 700-16 000 cal yr BP) in Europe south of the Alps	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Chironomids preserved in a sediment core from Lago di Origlio (416ma.s.l.), a lake in the foreland of the Southern Swiss Alps, allowed quantitative reconstruction of Late Glacial and Early Holocene summer temperatures using a combined Swiss-Norwegian temperature inference model based on chironomid assemblages from 274 lakes. We reconstruct July air temperatures of ca. 10 degrees C between 17 300 and 16 000 cal yr BP, a rather abrupt warming to ca. 12.0 degrees C at ca. 16 500-16 000 cal yr BP, and a strong temperature increase at the transition to the Bolling/Allerod interstadial with average temperatures of about 14 degrees C. During the Younger Dryas and earliest Holocene similar temperatures are reconstructed as for the interstadial. The rather abrupt warming at 16 500-16 000 cal yr BP is consistent with sea-surface temperature as well as speleothem records, which indicate a warming after the end of Heinrich event 1 (sensu stricto) and before the Bolling/Allerod interstadial in southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Pollen records from Origlio and other sites in southern Switzerland and northern Italy indicate an early reforestation of the lowlands 2000-1500 yr prior to the large-scale afforestation of Central Europe at the onset of the Bolling/Allerod period at ca. 14 700-14 600 cal yr BP. Our results suggest that these early afforestation processes in the formerly glaciated areas of northern Italy and southern Switzerland have been promoted by increasing temperatures.

We estimated magnitude of the heat transport along the bottom slope based on scaling analysis. The seasonal changes in DO concentration appear to be controlled mostly by biochemical consumption. We identify four factors controlling the extent of anoxic zones in shallow ice-covered lakes: (1) the amount of organic matter stored in the bottom layers, including the sediments surface during the autumnal bloom; (2) the length of the ice-covered period; (3) heat content of bottom sediments; and (4) the initial water temperatures at the time of the ice cover formation.					; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2009	43	3					617	627		10.1007/s10452-009-9288-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9288-x													WOS:000269837500003

For reliable assessments of the past climate patterns and their applications for evaluations of the ongoing changes, spatially comprehensive network of high-fidelity paleorecords are necessary. In this study, we reconstruct summer air temperatures of the past 2000 years from northern Lapland (Utsjoki, Finland). We use fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) assemblages from sediments of a remote subarctic lake (Loazzejavri) and the transfer function approach for quantitative temperature reconstruction. The results indicate that the Chironomidae fauna were responding to air temperature and the core assemblages had good modern analogues in the calibration set allowing reliable paleoclimate reconstruction. In our reconstruction, a warm period between similar to 900 and 1300 CE is synchronous with the globally defined extent of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), though beginning considerably later than previously reconstructed for eastern Scandinavia. The MCA was also relatively mild, as the temperatures were only 0.5 degrees C higher than the record average. Similar to eastern Scandinavia, a cold period corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA) was longer that typically observed in hemispheric reconstructions beginning already at similar to 1400 CE and lasting very close to modern times. We also found confirming evidence that the LIA was interrupted by a short-lived warmer period dividing it into two separate cold events in the region. Based on our results, the present is warmer than during any time of the MCA displaying how rapid and severe the ongoing climate change is.					; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Kivila, E.

J	Long, DGF				Long, Darrel G. F.			Architecture of pre-vegetation sandy-braided perennial and ephemeral river deposits in the Paleoproterozoic Athabasca Group, northern Saskatchewan, Canada as indicators of Precambrian fluvial style	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Late Palcoproterozoic Athabasca Basin contains more than 1.5 km of predominantly sandy strata, most of which are of braided fluvial origin. In the eastern part of the basin, at McClean Lake, sandstones and minor conglomerates of the Read Formation at the base of the succession are preserved within a steep-walled valley system. They consist predominantly of meterscale sheet elements, characterized by massive and flat-laminated fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone with minor discontinuous cobble and boulder conglomerate along lower set boundaries. These are interpreted as sheet-flood and stream-flood deposits of a terminal dry-land system, deposited in an and climatic setting. Analysis of closely spaced drill-core indicates that late stage run-off was confined to small shallow channels, typically only a few tens of meters wide and a few meters deep. Overlying strata of the Bird Member of the Manitou Falls Formation are predominantly coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstones with abundant small-scale cross-stratification and minor granule and small pebble conglomerate. At McClean Lake, these appear to have been deposited as sheet-elements by semi-ephemeral to perennial braided rivers under more humid conditions. At Key Lake, 160 km to the southwest, architectural analysis of a 184 m wide section indicates that at least part of the Bird Member was deposited in deeper, sandy-braided rivers characterized by seasonally varied flow. The closest modem analogue is the South Saskatchewan River, in which large simple flow-transverse bedforms become exposed and dissected during falling stage, and act as nuclei for sand-flat development. The presence of numerous low-relief 4th order surfaces suggests continued reworking of bar-tops during rising stage. The incremental character of downstream accretionary elements suggests periodic migration of barforms during peak-flood stages, separated by periods of low flow. This indicates similarities with modem perennial braided systems, and is counter to the idea that all pre-Devonian fluvial systems should consist of stacked sheets formed by individual flood events. Thin gravel layers accumulated as lags on fourth order surfaces, with discontinuous mud layers suggesting deposition within temporary ponds in channel thalwegs after major floods. Strata in overlying units indicate a return to semi-perennial conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, until now, little research has been focused on the microclimate and CO2 flux characteristics in this area. This paper reports the characteristics of daily variations of microclimate and CO2 flux in the Dunhuang Xihu desert wetland, based on data observed in the desert wetland during a period of continuous fine weather in summer 2012. Results indicate that the characteristics of the micrometeorology were significantly affected by the land-lake breeze during the study period, and updrafts were prevalent in this region. The friction wind speed and the vertical velocity were much greater than those in the Maqu grasslands. The energy budget was strongly imbalanced: the latent heat flux was significantly higher than the sensible flux. The daily mean values of total solar radiation and net radiation were larger than those in Maqu grasslands and Jinta oasis. There was a temperature inversion and inverse humidity gradient in the atmospheric surface layer at night. The desert wetland ecosystem was a carbon sink during the whole of the observation period, and the maximum rate of carbon absorption usually occurred at about 11:00 hr each day in this region.

BP. The most prominent wetter climate phases occurred between c. 9500 and 9280 +/- 160 and between c. 5000 and 4600 cal. BP while a hot and dry period between 8185 +/- 145 and 5299 +/- w195 cal. BP corresponds with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). The HTM phase has been characterized by absolute dominance of Tilia cordata and the presence of T. platyphyllos beyond its current geographical range limit and a c. 2700 yr long, high incidence of the parasite fungus Kretzschmaria deusta in the local forest stand, concurrent with a dry phase on the mire. For the HTM, we suggest mean summer temperatures at least 3 degrees C higher than today's values. These data are in accordance with the geographic pattern of the HTM temperature anomalies in northern Europe, including the Baltic region, which suggest a gradient of positive anomalies from north to south and from west to east. The data also illustrate the effect of climate warming on the mid-Holocene pathogen outbreak and may indicate intensive vegetative reproduction as a Tilia strategy for population survival. Summer drought was probably important for high success of K. deusta in infecting weakened Tilia trees.

Use of geochemical, isotopic, and age tracer data to develop models of groundwater flow for the purpose of water management, northern High Plains aquifer, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A prolonged drought in the High Plains of Nebraska prompted the use of groundwater for cooling at the largest coal-fired power plant in the State. Prior to the drought, groundwater was used primarily for irrigation and the power plant relied exclusively on surface water stored in a nearby reservoir for cooling. Seepage from the reservoir system during the past similar to 75 a has resulted in the buildup of a large mound of water in the underlying unconfined aquifer. A well field was installed during the drought for the purpose of tapping the groundwater mound as a supplemental source of water for cooling. Concentrations of dissolved Cl(-) and SO(4)(2-) indicate 65-100% of shallow groundwater and 0-100% of deep groundwater (saturated thickness similar to 115 m) in the immediate vicinity of the reservoir was from seepage out of the reservoir system. Hydrogen and 0 isotopic data indicate most surface-water seepage occurred in the late spring and early summer when reservoir stage was at its highest level. Tritium/(3)He apparent groundwater ages imply horizontal flow velocities from the reservoir were on the order of 60-600 m/a. These diverse data provided information regarding the spatial distribution, timing, and rate of seepage from the reservoir that could not have been obtained from the available geologic, hydraulic head, and conductivity data. In particular, mixing fractions of surface water and regional groundwater in the aquifer could not have been determined using hydraulic information. Mixing fractions were of special interest in this study because of the management objective to maximize the capture of surface-water seepage in the cooling water wells. Groundwater-flow models developed as well-field management tools were calibrated using inverse modeling techniques and observations of groundwater age, surface-water flow, reservoir stage, and groundwater levels. The age data only accounted for 6 of the 2574 field observations used to calibrate the groundwater-flow models, yet they were among the most influential for refining estimates of hydraulic conductivity, recharge, and seepage from the reservoir. Results from this study demonstrate the benefits of using geochemical, isotopic, and age tracer data to develop conceptual and numerical models of groundwater flow for the purpose of water management.

An inverse relationship was detected between each of these morphological characters and seasonal fluctuations in air/water temperatures. Mean head capsule width in all larval instars decreased by 4.8-7.9% in summer, while mean wing length decreased by 19.6%. These changes are discussed in relation to the annual range in mean air temperature in southern Africa and the distribution of An.merus. Implications for the use of such morphological characteristics in existing taxonomic keys are discussed.																			0269-283X					JAN	1991	5	1					55	62											1768901					WOS:A1991EZ65800009

J	Magny, M				Magny, Michel			Climatic and environmental changes reflected by lake-level fluctuations at Gerzensee from 14,850 to 13,050 yr BP	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												High-resolution sediment analysis at Gerzensee, Swiss Plateau, focused on the reconstruction of lake-level changes during the last glaciation Greenland Stadial 2a (GS-2a) and a large portion of Lateglacial including the Gerzensee oscillation. The chronology is derived from a comparison of the oxygen-isotope stratigraphy established at Gerzensee with that of the NGRIP ice core. On a multi-millennial scale differences between the lake-level and oxygen-isotope records established from cores GEJ-GEK reflect a complex interplay among climate, vegetation and lake level during retreat of the ice sheet. But on a multi-centennial scale both the lake-level and oxygen-isotope records show a general agreement, i.e. cool periods such as Greenland Stadial GS-2a and Greenland Interstadials-1d and -1b, which coincided with more positive water budgets and, conversely, warm periods (Greenland Interstadials-1e and -1c) with more negative water budget. This is in agreement with the regional pattern of palaeohydrological changes reconstructed from previous studies. Despite possible reduced annual precipitation during GS-2a, the maintenance of relatively high lake-level conditions at Gerzensee at this time could have resulted from reduced evaporation and stronger runoff on bare slopes, whereas during the Lateglacial Interstadial the phases of lake-level lowering may have been associated with summer dryness linked to increasing summer insolation.

J	Echelle, AA; Echelle, AF				Echelle, AA; Echelle, AF			Genetic introgression of endemic taxa by non-natives: A case study with leon springs pupfish and sheepshead minnow	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Genetic studies of a pupfish (Cyprinodon bovinus) endemic to a small, spring-fed system in west Texas illustrate the potential for small introductions of non-native species to cause large-scale genetic changes through hybridization and genetic introgression. We performed a genetic survey (allozymes and RFLP analysis of mtDNA) of four samples of c. bovinus representing all wild populations of the species and a captive population maintained since 1976 at Dexter, New Mexico. The results indicate genetic introgression of the entire wild population by sheepshead minnow (C. variegatus), a coastal species with a history of introductions in west Texas Frequencies of foreign genetic elements averaged across four diagnostic allozyme loci and mtDNA varied from 6.1 to 15.1%. The captive population appears free of foreign genetic material. Comparisons with past Studies of C. bovinus indicate the present situation is largely due to a recent introduction of C. variegatus, not to art introduction in the mid-1970s; however residual effects from the earlier introduction cannot be completely discounted Genetic analysis indicates that the sou,ice of introduced C. variegatus in Diamond Y Draw is the nearest known population, an introduced stock in Lake Balmorhea approximately 90 km away The results demonstrate the value of maintaining imperiled species in captivity. Captive C. bovinus provide an opportunity to restore the genetic integrity of wild populations.																			0888-8892	1523-1739				FEB	1997	11	1					153	161		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.95427.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.95427.x													WOS:A1997WJ11100022

The temporal sequence of sedimentary cores retrieved from Lake Sugan since 2 kaBP was reconstructed using the Pb-210, AMS C-14 and conventional 14 C dating methods. Carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate in the fine-grained lake sediments were analysed. Combined with the changes of delta(18)O values of surface water and air temperature observation data in the study area, it might be thought that the delta(18)O value of the carbonate indicates effective moisture, and the changes in delta(18)O values are related to annual freeze-up duration of the lake and indirectly indicate air temperature changes in winter half year. From the above, the sequence of climatic changes in the region since 2 kaBP was established. The climatic changes experienced five stages: Warm-dry climate during 0-190 AD; cold-dry climate during 190-580 AD; warm-dry climate during 580-1200 AD (MWP); cold-wet climate during 1200-1880 AD (LIA); cold-dry climate during 1880-1950 AD; and climate warming since 1950s. The air temperature changes in winter half year reflected by carbon isotope since 2 kaBP are in good agreement with the historical literature records and other geologic records, which shows that the climate changes recorded by the stable isotopes from Lake Sugan since 2 kaBP are of universal significance.

J	Yamamoto, Y; Nakahara, H				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Nakahara, Hiroyuki			Importance of interspecific competition in the abundance of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Cyanophyceae)	LIMNOLOGY												The population dynamics of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae var. klebahnii Elenk. (Cyanophyceae) was studied in an artificial pond for 32 months from May 2002 to December 2004. Our previous in vitro study showed that the lower limits of water temperature and pH for its growth are within the ranges of 11 degrees-14 degrees C and 7.1-7.4, respectively, and it appeared that these findings are applicable to the emergence and disappearance of Ap. flos-aquae in the pond. Based on the change in the water temperature, the emergence of Ap. flos-aquae in 2004 was expected to be in late April, whereas emergence occurred after a 1-month lag period. During this period, Ankistrodesmus falcatus (Corda) Ralfs (Chlorophyceae) dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, which raised the possibility that the growth of Ap. flos-aquae was restricted by the existence of An. falcatus. We conducted mixed cultures of Ap. flos-aquae and An. falcatus at four temperatures (14 degrees, 19 degrees, 24 degrees, and 29 degrees C). After 18 days of incubation, An. falcatus dominated at 14 degrees and 29 degrees C whereas Ap. flos-aquae dominated at 19 degrees C. This result indicates that a slightly higher water temperature than the growth threshold value is needed for Ap. flosaquae to outcompete An. falcatus, which agrees with the field observation. Contrary to the results of the mixed culture, the summer phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by Ap. flos-aquae, and the population of An. falcatus was less or almost absent. This variation seemed to be partly caused by the difference in nutrient conditions; concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the pond were far lower than those in the culture medium. The lack of nitrogen fixation of An. falcatus seemed to be a growth disadvantage during the summer when the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was low.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2006	7	3					163	170		10.1007/s10201-005-0189-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-005-0189-y													WOS:000242770900003
J	Rzepecki, M				Rzepecki, Marek			DYNAMICS OF PHOSPHORUS IN LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS: THE PROCESS OF UPTAKE/RELEASE OF DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS BY SEDIMENTS IN DIFFERENT HABITATS AND LAKES	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Lake eutrophication and its consequences is still an important water quality problem being an effect of nutrient input to surface waters. In most lakes of the temperate zone, phosphorus is the nutrient responsible for eutrophication. Bottom sediments are the main pool involved in the retention and cycling of this element. Bottom sediments, depending on their chemical composition and aeration of the overlying water, may take up or release dissolved phosphorus i.e. the form easy utilizable by the plants. This study was aimed at comparing the exchange (uptake/release) of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in experiments that simulated natural conditions in various types of bottom sediments originating from different river-lake habitats typical of Masurian Lakeland (north-east Poland). Several river-lake systems typical for postglacial landscape were selected like river Jorka (15 km long, 5 lakes in cascade) and river Krutynia (similar to 100 km long flowing through 17 lakes). Sediments used in experiments were taken from the littoral and profundal zones of four lakes (meso- meso-eu-, eutrophic and hypertrophic), from a humic lake and from ecotone zones at the land-water border and at the border between lake and river (from through-flow lakes). In total, 154 experiments were performed to assess the intensity of P exchange at a high (>8 mg O-2 L-1) and low (<2 mg O-2 L-1) concentration of oxygen in water overlying undisturbed sediment cores. The following P fractions were isolated using the sequential extraction method and their importance was further analysed: easily exchangeable P (NH4Cl-RP - loosely bound, most available P; BD-RP - redox-dependent P associated with metal (Fe, Mn) hydroxides; NaOH-RP - phosphorus adsorbed mainly on metal (Fe, Al) oxides), hardly exchangeable P (BD-NRP - mainly organic P, whose stability depends on redox potential; NaOH-NRP - phosphorus in microorganisms, polyphosphates and part of organic P bound to detritus and humic substances) and non-exchangeable P (HCl-P - phosphorus bound to carbonates, apatite-P and phosphorus released during total dissolution of metal oxides; P-residual - non-exchangeable P together with part of organic P). The effect of various factors (i.e. Fe, Mn, Mg, Al, Ca, organic matter, total P content and its fractions) on the intensity of DRP uptake/release was analysed with Pearson correlation and multiple regression. In sediments (both littoral and profundal) from lakes of the Jorka River trophic gradient, high oxygen conditions were always accompanied by P uptake (from -0.9 to -2.8 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) while reduced oxygen concentrations were followed by DRP release (from 2.3 to 18.6 mg P m(-2) d(-1)). These values were several dozen times higher than those noted for sediments from humic lake. Profundal sediments released more P than the littoral ones. In profundal sediments of all lakes of the Jorka River, the intensity of DRP release to overlying water under reduced O-2 concentrations was higher than the uptake rate under aerobic conditions. It means that DRP release prevailed over its uptake. Release rate of DRP tended to be higher from sediments of eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes than from those of meso- and meso-eutrophic lakes both in the two studied habitats (littoral, profundal) and seasons (spring and summer). Sediments of humic lake (from both littoral and profundal zones) showed a low dynamics of DRP uptake/release with a small prevalence of the latter (0.02 to 0.08 mg P m(-2) d(-1)). River-lake-river sediments (from the inflows and outflows of the Krutynia River to a lake) were different in comparison with typical lake sediments they released DRP to aerated overlying water in both meso- and meso-eutrophic lake. Phosphorus was released from in-shore bog sediments at reduced oxygen concentration in overlying water in both seasons (spring and summer) while under aerobic conditions DRP was weakly taken up and/or released. Fe, Mn, Mg, total P content and redox-dependent easily exchangeable BD-RP fraction had a significant effect on the intensity of P uptake at high concentration of oxygen and P release under reduced oxygen concentration (Pearson correlation, P<0.01). Factor analysis showed that at a high O-2 concentration the intensity of DRP uptake by sediments was determined by redox-dependent fraction of P bound to Fe and Mn hydroxides (BD-RP) and the P fraction bound to carbonates and apatite (HCl-P) (r(2) = 0.48). At reduced O-2 concentration in overlying water the intensity of DRP release was affected by redox-dependent fraction of P associated with Fe and Mn hydroxides (BD-RP), P fraction bound to metal oxides (NaOH-RP), organic P in detritus, P in microorganisms and combined in humic substances (NaOH-NRP) and P fraction bound to carbonates and apatites (HCl-P) (r(2) = 0.63). Sediments from eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes in the lower course of the Jorka River are most intensively eutrophicated. They showed the highest values of DRP release and the predominance of P release over P uptake was the highest (up to seven fold). Sediments of these lakes contained the highest amounts of redox-dependent elements Fe and Mn. Hence, these lakes easily accumulate phosphorus at high concentrations of oxygen but equally easily release it when oxygen in water is depleted. More stable are meso- and meso-eutrophic lakes situated higher in the Jorka River system. Sediments of these lakes released smaller amounts of DRP than eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes and the prevalence of DRP release over uptake was threefold. In-shore bog sediments form a stable system when overlying waters are rich in oxygen. Under reduced oxygen concentrations, however, these habitats become an important P source (comparable with profundal sediments) for lake littoral zone in case of their close contact with lake waters. A system able to bind phosphorus stronger and faster will hamper the delivery of available P to lake water and thus will delay lake eutrophication; that able to release P will accelerate eutrophication. In this case, internal loading may have a decisive effect on the lake trophic status. Profundal mid-lake sites, in-shore bogs and to a smaller extent littoral sediments (gyttja type) are the systems accelerating eutrophication. Humic lake sediments (dy type) are more equilibrated among the studied systems the differences between uptake and release are small there.																			1505-2249						2012	60	4					717	740																WOS:000312519300006
J	Gao, L; Liao, JJ; Shen, GZ				Gao, Le; Liao, Jingjuan; Shen, Guozhuang			Monitoring lake-level changes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using radar altimeter data (2002-2012)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Lake-level change can be an important indicator for the water balance in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, it is not feasible to perform continuous in-situ measurements for a large number of lakes because of the remoteness and harsh climatic conditions on this plateau. Satellite altimetry has been successfully used for monitoring water-level changes of inland lakes in recent years. In this study, water-level changes between 2002 and 2012 of 51 lakes on the QTP were monitored using multialtimeter data from Envisat/RA-2, Cryosat-2/Siral, Jason-1/Poseidon-2, and Jason-2/Poseidon-3. The water levels of 42 of the lakes have a mean rising trend of 0.275 m/a, whereas the water levels of nine lakes have a mean decreasing trend of -0.144 m/a. Overall, the water level of these lakes had a mean increasing trend of 0.201 m/a in the past 10 years. For the lakes distributed over the entire plateau, it was found that the lake levels in different basins had different change characteristics: the lake levels in the southern plateau show a decreasing trend, whereas lake levels in the northern plateau show an increasing trend. In the central plateau, the water levels of most lakes also show an increasing trend but the water levels of a small number of the lakes show a decreasing trend. In addition, the winter or summer linear trends for the levels of individual lakes appear to be opposite to the trends observed for the yearly average. The combined use of data from several different altimeters makes the temporal resolution of lake-level change measurements higher than for those results derived using only one kind of altimeter data. However, the number of lakes monitored in this study is affected by the footprints of satellites orbits on the Earth's surface. After taking into account anomalous lake levels, systematic elevation differences, and periodic changes in the water level, the biggest root-mean-square-error for the lakes monitored in this study is <40 cm/a showing that the results have a high degree of accuracy. Lake-level change is mainly related to rising temperatures, increasing precipitation, and decreasing evaporation. In particular, rising temperatures accelerate the melting of glaciers and perennial snow cover and trigger permafrost degradation, leading to an increase in the water level of most lakes across the plateau.

The geographic focus is the St. Joseph River plume in southern Lake Michigan. One set of EO-1 Hyperion imagery and one set of boat-based spectrometer measurements were successfully acquired to capture episodic plume events. Coincident water quality measurements were also collected during these plume events. In this study, a database of inherent optical properties (IOPs) measurements and spectral signatures was generated and used to calibrate the bio-geo-optical model. Field measured concentrations of NAP and CDOM at 67% of the sampled sites fall within one standard deviation of the retrieved means using the spectrometer measurements. The percentage of sites, 88%, is higher for the estimation of CHL concentrations. Despite the dynamic nature of the observed plume and the time Iag during field sampling, 77% of the sampled sites show field measured CHL and NAP concentrations falling within one standard deviation of the Hyperion derived values. The spatial maps of water quality parameters generated from the Hyperion image provided a synoptic view of water quality conditions. Results show that concentrations of NAP, CHL, and CDOM were more than three times higher in conjunction with river outflow, and inside the river plumes, than in ambient water. It is concluded that the storm-initiated plume is a significant source of sediments, carbon and chlorophyll to Lake Michigan. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	VEKHOV, NV				VEKHOV, NV			CYCLOMORPHOSIS IN DAPHNIA-LONGIREMIS IN THE TUNDRA LAKES	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The seasonal changes of head form in D. longiremis Sars were studied in the tundra lakes during different years. The formation of a well developed galea in summer in the lakes of average depth (6.5 m) was noted. A similar phenomenon was noted in the shallow lakes of the Northeast of the USSR only. Changes in head structure in D. longiremis are similar to those in D. cristata occurring in the taiga water bodies. The appearance of forms with the developed galea is observed only during the warm years. The main cause of galea formation is the rise of temperature above the threshold value (10-12.degree. C). It is suggested that such an adaptation protects the water fleas against predators.																			0044-5134						1979	58	8					1136	1140																WOS:A1979HK54900006

J	LEE, RE				LEE, RE			AGGREGATION OF LADY BEETLES ON THE SHORES OF LAKES (COLEOPTERA, COCCINELLIDAE)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Aggregations of lady bettles, predominately Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunctata, were commonly observed on the shores of lakes in the upper midtime, usually dispersing within 2-3 wk. Lady beetles from autumn shore aggregations and overwintering aggregations are characterized by the presence of large amounts of fat, reproductive inactivity, empty digestive tracts, a skew in the sex ratio favoring females and the behavioral tendency to form aggregations. H. convergens, the most commonly observed coccinellid in shore aggregations, undergoes long migratory flights to and from overwintering sites in California [USA]. Similar migratory activity occurs in the upper midwest and during these flights the beetles may be blown into the water and washed ashore, forming the aggregations. In contrast with the overwintering aggregations in California, the shore aggregations reported in this study appear to be temporary shoreline collections and not the overwintering site.

In shallow areas of the lake, the release of As contributed to the continuous seasonal variation in the As concentration in the lake water. In areas that became stratified in summer the As released from the sediments accumulated in the hypolimnion until turnover when it was mixed with epilimnetic water. It was estimated that the turnover effect resulted in a temporary increase in the As concentration of 10-20%. Important chemical transformations were identified, and a model for the system was compared with previous theoretical models for lacustrine systems.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1985	19	3					231	238		10.1021/es00133a002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00133a002								22296009					WOS:A1985ACM8900007

Weakened Asian summer monsoon during the YD is recorded in oxygen isotopes of stalagmite from Mainland China. However, lacustrine climate record of the YD event has not been reported from the subtropical land-ocean boundary of the Asian continent near the Pacific warm pool. We provide a lignin biomarker record covering the last deglaciation and early Holocene (17-9 ka BP) from the Dongyuan Lake, southern Taiwan, located at the frontal zone of typhoon invasion. The lignin phenol ratio S/V shows that the vegetation in the catchments had shifted from gymnosperm dominant to angiosperm dominant plants since 12.2 ka BP. Significantly decreased lignin concentrations (TLP and lambda(8)) and elevated lignin degradation parameters ((Ad/A1)v, P/(V + S), DHBA/V) in combination with other organic proxies (TOC, delta 13Corg) during the late YD suggest a severe drought had occurred in southern Taiwan during this specific period. Changes in the lignin proxies from the Dongyuan Lake lagged the climate changes registered in stalagmite records by around 500-800 years, suggesting a slow response of vegetation and soil processes to rapid climate changes.

The data were collected in 2012 at the main docks in the cities of Humaita, Boca do Acre, Jurua, Tabatinga and Parintins. The common name of the fish species was registered, along with other information such as catch (kg), fishing gear, origin and fishing effort. In general, migratory Characiformes were the most abundant. Boca do Acre on the Purus River showed a dominance of Siluriformes, mainly surubim (Pseudoplatystoma spp.). In general, fishlandings were higher during the falling water season. Gillnets and a kind of purse seine (locally called "redinha") concentrated the captures and River and lakes were the most explored fishing grounds.

Repeat surveys of spawning cisco (Coregonus artedi) in western Lake Superior: timing, distribution and composition of spawning stocks	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					Acoustic (AC) and midwater trawl (MT) surveys of spawning cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Lake Superior have been combined with commercial yield to estimate exploitation. To time surveys properly, it is important to understand when adults typically arrive at spawning grounds and how numbers change as the spawning season progresses. We conducted repeat autumn surveys during nighttime hours at coastal sites where commercial roe fisheries occur. Spawner densities increased significantly from October to mid-November, but differences measured at sites sampled from mid- to late-November were comparatively small. Spawners occupied the upper 20-30 m of the water column during mid-November before utilizing a wider range of depths by late-November. We compared repeat AC densities to temporal trends of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in suspended commercial gillnets and found good agreement within sites. Because different gillnet mesh sizes were used in each roe fishery, CPUE and AC density were poorly correlated among sites. We recommend that future surveys be conducted between mid- and late-November, and that MT gear be used to measure cisco densities in the uppermost 10 m of the water column where AC estimates may be conservative. Given the short temporal window for assessing spawner density, we believe both AC-MT and gillnet surveys will be needed to ensure that harvest of different stocks is kept at a sustainable level.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						65	+																WOS:000313086600005
J	Romo, S				Romo, S.			Seasonal zooplankton patterns in a shallow oligotrophic lake: Loch Rusky (Scotland)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The zooplankton taxa and their seasonal distribution are describeb for Loch Rusky, a shallow oligotrophic lake in the central region of Scotland. 15 species were indentified : 11 Rotifera, 2 Cladocera and 2 Copepoda. Only 5 species Polyathra remata, Keratella cochlearis, Filinia terminalis, Trichocerca sp. and Eudiaptomus gracilis occurred In sufficient numbers to facilitate a description of their seasonal pattern. The annual zooplankton variation was dominated by rotifers for most of the year, but copepods (E. gracilis, Cyclops sp.) only were dominant in the epilimnion during summer. It is presumed that this pattern was the result of the rotifers faster rate of reproduction and higher grazing efficiency under oligotrophic conditions, as well as the decrease of larger zooplankton by the continuous programme of fish stocking in the lake.																			0003-4088					JAN	1990	26	1					11	17		10.1051/limn/1990001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1990001													WOS:000208072600002
J	Murck, A				Murck, Alfreda			SU SHI AND ZHAO LINGRANG Brush Ideas of Wang Wei	ARS ORIENTALIS												The poet and painter Wang Wei (699-759) of the Tang dynasty (618-907) "had poetry in his painting and painting in his poetry!' With that claim, Su Shi (1037-1101) linked painting with a prestigious literary genre. Although no one believed that painting held a status equal to poetry, eleventh -century appropriations of literary forms and allusions into painting were an important development in the history of Chinese culture. The literary turn elevated painting to an elite art. Connoisseurs of the eleventh and later centuries saw connections to Wang Wei in the paintings of Zhao Lingrang (active 1070 -after 1100). Su Shi and Huang Tingjian (1045-1105) encouraged Zhao's efforts. The connoisseur Dong Qichang (1555-1636) of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), after carefully studying Summer Mist along the Lakeshore (Huzhuang qingxia to (sic)), wrote in a colophon on the handscroll (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) that Zhao's composition thoroughly followed the brush ideas (bi yi (sic)) of Wang Wei. This essay argues that what Su Shi encouraged, what Zhao Lingrang created in Summer Mist, and what Dong Qichang observed was a relationship that transcended mere imitation of brushwork. Zhao's connection to Wang Wei was not stylistic, but rather was a matter of approach: Zhao was working like a literatus, thinking in poetic structures, and expressing his thoughts by painting literary metaphors. Poetic structure will be analyzed as well as three literary tropes: trees, gurgling stream, and the configuration of eight rocks.																			0571-1371						2019	49						3	21																WOS:000496343300002

Coeval dry events in the central and eastern Mediterranean basin at 5.2 and 5.6 ka recorded in Corchia (Italy) and Soreq caves (Israel) speleothems	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Soreq (Israel) and Corchia (central Italy) Caves are located 2500 km far apart along the Mediterranean winter-storm track and are ideally suited for investigating past variations of winter rainfall in the Mediterranean region. Analyses of speleothem delta O-18 records from both caves for the period between ca. 7 to 4 ka BP show some striking similarities for the ca. 6 and 4 ka interval, but lack agreement between ca. 7 to 6 ka BP. Two prominent isotopic excursions, argued to reflect relatively drier conditions, are centred at ca. 5.6 and ca. 5.2 ka. The 5.2 ka event lasts less than a century, whereas the 5.6 ka event extends from ca. 5.7 to 5.4 ka. A period of progressive drying is also apparent from ca. 5 to 4 ka. Another prominent event, reflecting wetter conditions, is recorded in both records at ca. 5.8 ka and seems to last several decades. The 5.6 and 52 ka events occurred within a period of higher deposition of haematite-stained grains in cores of the sub-polar North Atlantic, and correlation with the wind strength proxy record from Holmsa loess profile in Iceland suggests that rainfall reduction was related to a reduced vapour advection from Atlantic towards the Mediterranean connected to northward shift in the Westerlies. A comparison with Alpine records, including the Spannagel Cave isotope record, suggests that dry events recorded at Soreq and Corchia caves may correspond to wetter (lake high stands) and cooler (glacier expansion) conditions in the Alpine region, indicating complex regional climate re-organization.

J	Architects, AP				Architects, Arquitectos Promontorio			MORA RIVER AQUARIUM. MORA, ALENTEJO, PORTUGAL	EN BLANCO-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA												The River Aquarium is located in Mora, a small municipality in the Northern Alentejo region. Given the need to shift regional development from the dependence of an increasingly weaker agriculture economy into the environmental tourism and leisure market, the municipality launched a design-and-build competition for an aquarium that could somehow embody the paradigms of biodiversity of the Iberian river. Integrated in the Ecological Wild Park of Gameiro and bordering the Raia stream, the building stands amidst a secluded field of cork and olive trees removed from the more intense leisure and fishing activities of the river. Other than the eminently technological nature of the programme, the building refers to the vernacular type, by evoking the profile of the canonical Alentejo whitewash barns known as "montes". Three key factors are decisive in the overall sustainability and user-friendliness of the building: Thermal passive control; Construction System with prefabrication and general monitoring technologies; and Multimedia with interactive exhibit contents 1. Thermal passive control Given the blazing Alentejo sun and the need to create shade, the volume implantation respects the solar orientation, improving temperature in every aspect. Thus, the building was devised as a compact and monolithic volume with a pitched shelter of thin white pre-cast concrete porticos with single spans of 33 meters. The distance between the porticos was studied in order to exploit shading all year round, maximizing thermal passive control on the facade via cross-ventilation. The shading and cross ventilation systems along with the water circuits foster the reduction of cooling energy, the increase in humidity and the wellbeing of animal and vegetable life. Moreover, natural ventilation was devised in order to take the advantage of the basement's thermal mass. In addition, a skylight produces a "chimney effect", bringing up the air from the basement ( hot in the winter and fresh in the summer). The presence of water is also an element of the thermal passive control; notably by the introduction of a small dam on the West facade. The building seats on the surface of this proposal lake, decreasing the temperature in the summer and improving thermal comfort. Last but not least, atomizing the water on the entrance and other critical areas of the aquarium adds to comfort of the visitor's promenade, thereby reducing energy consumption. 2. Construction System Prefabrication and general monitoring technologies are the determining constructional elements of this project. The large shading concrete porticos have been pre-cast and brought on-site, to the final pre-stressed assembly of its special joints. The use of this technology made possible single spans of 33 meters. Another innovative tool is the special monitoring technologies of a general management system that includes life support systems, living exhibits, lighting and temperature control of public areas. On the basement, these support systems guaranty stability of water temperature, ph, ozone, quality control and filtering for each habitat parameter, including a duct gallery below each exhibit to supply and monitor water flow. For this building, the water is taken from a well on the plot, pumped into a deposit and regenerated after use. 3. Multimedia applied on interactive exhibit contents Part of the building's immense public success is grounded on the attractiveness its interactive multimedia application on exhibit contents. This application was based on virtual and interactive platforms, activated by touch sensors and specific computer software. The exhibition interpretative contents in particular, can be viewed and operated on a large wall screen.																			1888-5616	2445-1215					2011	3	7					44	+																WOS:000441871400004

Forty-seven new subglacial lakes in the 0-110° E sector of East Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												During the summer field seasons of 1987-91, studies of central East Antarctica by airborne radio-echo sounding commenced. This scientific work continued in the 1990s in the Vostok Subglacial Lake area and along the traverse route from Mirny, and led to the discovery of 16 new subglacial water cavities in the areas of Domes Fuji and Argus and the Prince Charles Mountains. Twenty-nine subglacial water cavities were revealed in the area near Vostok, along with a feature we believe to be a subglacial river. Two subglacial lakes were discovered along the Mirny-Vostok traverse route. These are located 50 km north of Komsomolskaya station and under Pionerskaya station. We find high geothermal heat flux in the vicinity of the largest of the subglacial lakes, and suggest this may be due to their location over deep faults where additional mantle heat is available.

Examining past temperature variability in Moosonee, Thunder Bay, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada through a day-to-day variability framework	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Temperature variability in Moosonee, Thunder Bay, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada is examined through a day-to-day variability framework. Statistical measures used in this study include standard deviation (SD), day-to-day temperature variability (DTD), DTD/SD ratio (G), change in day-to-day variability (Delta DTD), and threshold measures of 5A degrees C and 10A degrees C. Delta DTD is the difference between day-to-day change in temperature maximum (DTDtmax) and day-to-day change in temperature minimum (DTDtmin). A distinct seasonal trend is reflected in DTD in Moosonee, Thunder Bay, and Toronto, where Delta DTD is greatest during spring. Monthly Delta DTD averages in Toronto, Thunder Bay, and Moosonee are affected by seasonal variation, the lake effect, and the freeze-up of nearby waterbodies. Yearly averages of Delta DTD have significantly increased over the past recent years in Moosonee and Thunder Bay; a continual increase in climate variability may be detrimental to the subsistence lifestyle of those living in these areas.					; Gough, William/L-5231-2013	Tam, Benita/0000-0001-6319-7515; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2012	110	1-2					103	113		10.1007/s00704-012-0622-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0622-1													WOS:000309590500009

The palaeoflood record, with more than 80 flood events, shows clusters of floods at specific periods from 9440 to 9210 C-14 yr BP (8540-8110 BC, 8500 to 8000 C-14 yr BP (7500-7000 BC). similar to 6750 C-14 yr BP (similar to 5000 BC), 1200 to 950 C-14 yr BP (AD 785-1205), similar to410 C-14 yr BP (AD 1450-1500) 170 to 80 14C yr BP (AD 1670-1950). The largest flood(s) occurred during the periods 9440 to 9210 C-14 yr BP, similar to 6750 C-14 yr BP and 1200 to 950 C-14 yr BP reaching minimum discharge estimates of between 4000 and 4100 m(3) s(-1) in the El Puente del Arzobispo reach and 13,700-15, 000 m(3) s(-1) in the Alcantara reach. These periods with increased flood magnitude and/or frequency in the Tagus River are strongly related to increased moisture influx and winter precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the western zone. Proxy records sensitive to winter precipitation such as lake levels and vegetation changes (indicated by pollen records) are in good agreement with the clusters of floods found in the Tagus River. This flood variability seems to correspond to changes in the prevailing atmospheric circulation pattern affecting the Iberian Peninsula. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While sulfur is essential for life processes, certain sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, are toxic to all life forms. Micro-organisms facilitate the sulfur cycle, playing a prominent role even in extreme environments, such as soda lakes, acid mine drainage sites, hot springs, and other harsh habitats. The activity of these micro-organisms presents unique opportunities for mitigating sulfur-based pollution and enhancing the recovery of sulfur and metals. This review highlights the application of sulfur-oxidizing and -reducing micro-organisms in environmental biotechnology through three illustrative examples. Additionally, it discusses the challenges, recent trends, and prospects associated with these applications.

Changes in water density alone did not affect vertical movement. Abolition of the descending blue dance could not explain the results because the light source had a spectrum shifted to the red region. The magnitude of vertical migration may be reduced by an avoidance reaction to cold temperatures commonly observed in temperate lakes during summer stratification.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	2					262	271		10.4319/lo.1982.27.2.0262	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.2.0262													WOS:A1982NJ03300008

Spatiotemporal distributions of intestinal helminths in female lesser scaup Aythya affinis during spring migration from the upper Midwest, USA	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												We examined the associations between intestinal helminth infracommunity structure and infection parameters and the age, size, and year and region of collection of 130 female lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) during their 2014-2015 spring migrations through the upper Midwest, USA. We identified a total of 647,174 individual helminths from 40 taxa, including 20 trematodes, 14 cestodes, 4 nematodes and 2 acanthocephalans parasitizing lesser scaup within the study area. Lesser scaup were each infected with 2-23 helminth taxa. One digenean, Plenosoma minimum, is reported for the first time in lesser scaup and in the Midwest. Mean trematode abundance and total helminth abundance was significantly less in 2015 than 2014, and we suspect that colder weather late in 2015 impacted the intermediate host fauna and caused the observed differences. Brillouin's species diversity of helminths was greatest in the northernmost region of the study area, which coincides with the range of a non-indigenous snail that indirectly causes annual mortality events of lesser scaup. While host age and size were not determined to be influential factors of helminth infracommunity structure, non-parametric ordination and permutational analysis of co-variance revealed that year and region of collection explained differences in helminth infracommunities. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal variations play an important role in the structure of intestinal helminth infracommunities found in migrating lesser scaup hosts, and may therefore impact host ability to build endogenous reserves at certain stopover locations in the Midwest.

We investigated the primary production (PP) of phytoplankton, submerged macrophytes, and their epiphytes, from June to August 2005, in two large shallow lakes. The production of pelagic and littoral phytoplankton and of the dominant submerged macrophytes in the littoral zone (Potamogeton perfoliatus in Lake Peipsi and P. perfoliatus and Myriopyllum spicatum in Lake Vrtsjarv) and of their epiphytes was measured using a modified (14)C method. The total PP of the submerged macrophyte area was similar in both lakes: 12.4 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Peipsi and 12.0 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Vrtsjarv. In Peipsi, 84.2% of this production was accounted for by macrophytes, while the shares of phytoplankton and epiphytes were low (15.6 and 0.16%, respectively). In Vrtsjarv, macrophytes contributed 58%, phytoplankton 41.9% and epiphytes 0.1% of the PP in the submerged macrophyte area. Epiphyte production in both lakes was very low in comparison with that of phytoplankton and macrophytes: 0.01, 5.04, and 6.97 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively, in Vrtsjarv, and 0.02, 1.93, and 10.5 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively, in Peipsi. The PP of the littoral area contributed 10% of the total summer PP of Lake Peipsi sensu stricto and 35.5% of the total summer PP of Lake Vrtsjarv.

They are the carbonate deposits of crustal (spongy) and/or alabaster-textured formations controlled by both organic and inorganic processes. The structures formed under the influence of inorganic processes include the accumulations an the fissure and joint ridges. These structures are adjacent to the hot water emergence spots representing the points of rapid hot water flow and sudden release of CO2. The structures developed under the influence of organic processes form in areas at relatively farther distances from the hot water emergence points. These structures were described to be "waterfall or cascade deposits"; "terrace-mound travertines"; and "shallow lake fans" by different researchers. They are recognized in the field by special identifying trails such as manganous-ferrous travertine shrubs resembling ivy, siliceous stromatolites, and ferrous pisoids, 3 to 12 mm in diameter. All the modem travertine samples examined are dominantly farmed by subidiomorphic prismatic-tabular calcite crystals. Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed that calcite crystals forming the pisoids are characterized by zonal growth. Stromatolitic formations, on the other hand, bear regular joints developed as a consequence of sudden cooling and some special structures indicative of bacterial activity (in the farm of nodule, spheroid, ellipsoid, column, filament and honeycomb or grape bunch structures). In addition, secondary dissolution vugs and poles giving way to the release of CO2 are associated structures with the stromatolitic formations. The data collected from all the utilized techniques suggest that the microbiological formations observed in the travertines of Sicakcermite hot spring were produced by the sulfate-reducing, boring-budding bacteria such as Coccoids, Pedomicrobium, Beggiatoa sp., Thiobacillus sp., as well as blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria). The travertine occurrences produced by both organic and inorganic processes have an annual average of 3-5 cm deposition in thickess. The hot water emergence points and their flowpaths manifest seldom-found natural features. These natural monuments are irresponsibly destroyed for several reasons. The authors argue that these formations, significant from the point of view of their occurrence mechanism as well as their final products, must be preserved. If accomplished, a modem natural monument similar to that in Pamukkale (Turkey) and Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) could develop within a reasonable length of time.

In those years weather conditions differed substantially. This resulted not only in a great difference in the water surface temperature (in 1993, 17.8 +/- 0.47 degrees C; in 1995, 20.4 +/- 0.33 degrees C), but also in an increase in the depth of metalimnion zone in 1995 in comparison with 1993. The ecological efficiency (K-e), the ratio of secondary to primary consumer productions, was 0.28 +/- 0.031 in 1993 and 0.21 +/- 0.034 in 1995. The higher K-e was accompanied by lowering of spatial structurization, primary and secondary consumer production.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1997	363						303	307		10.1023/A:1003144915391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003144915391													WOS:000074552900026
J	WARBURTON, JA; YOUNG, LG; STONE, RH				WARBURTON, JA; YOUNG, LG; STONE, RH			ASSESSMENT OF SEEDING EFFECTS IN SNOWPACK AUGMENTATION PROGRAMS - ICE NUCLEATION AND SCAVENGING OF SEEDING AEROSOLS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Trace chemical analysis techniques have been used in a series of cloud-seeding experiments in the central Sierra Nevada with the ultimate purpose of distinguishing whether the submicron-sized aerosol particles used for seeding are removed by nucleation or by scavenging in snowfall. The research programs used submicron-sized seeding aerosols with different nucleating characteristics. When winter storms were seeded with silver iodide in the Lake Tahoe and Lake Almanor watersheds, positive correlations were observed between silver concentrations and precipitation amounts in both catchment areas. This is considered to be evidence that the AgI aerosols are not being removed in the snowfall entirely by scavenging processes. When two separate aerosols of silver iodide and indium sesquioxide were released simultaneously from the same ground locations during winter snowstorms in the Lake Almanor watershed, it was found that considerably more of the ice-nucleating aerosol particles (Agr) were removed by the snowfall than the non-ice-nucleating ones (In2O3). Under the experimental conditions employed, scavenging alone of the two aerosols would lead to a chemical ratio of Ag:In in the snowfall of 0.83:1. Ratios as high as 17.2:1 were observed, the mean ratio being 4:1. These results are considered to be evidence of the removal of substantial numbers of the AgI aerosol particles through direct nucleation of ice crystals.																			0894-8763					JAN	1995	34	1					121	130		10.1175/1520-0450-34.1.121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450-34.1.121													WOS:A1995QA49800009

To better identify the characteristics of flood-drought alternations, we proposed a modified dry-wet abrupt alternation index (DWAAI) and applied the new method in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB-ML) to analyze the long-term spatio-temporal characteristics of dry-wet abrupt alternation (DWAA) events based on the daily precipitation observations at 75 rainfall stations in summer from 1960 to 2015. We found that the DWAA events have been spreading in the study area with higher frequency and intensity since 1960. In particular, the DWAA events mainly occurred in May and June in the northwest of the YRB-ML, including Hanjiang River Basin, the middle reaches of the YRB, north of Dongting Lake and northwest of Poyang Lake. In addition, we also analyzed the impact of El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on DWAA events in the YRB-ML. The results showed that around 41.04% of DWAA events occurred during the declining stages of La Nia or within the subsequent 8 months after La Nia, which implies that La Nia events could be predictive signals of DWAA events. Besides, significant negative correlations have been found between the modified DWAAI values of all the rainfall stations and the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Nino3.4 region within the 6 months prior to the DWAA events, particularly for the Poyang Lake watershed and the middle reaches of the YRB. This study has significant implications on the flood and drought control and water resources management in the YRB-ML under the challenge of future climate change.					zhang, yanjun/GPG-2157-2022; Song, Jiyun/JKJ-1398-2023; she, dunxian/B-4667-2018; Xia, Jun/G-5095-2018	Song, Jiyun/0000-0002-9483-0501; zhang, yanjun/0000-0001-6889-9321; 													1009-637X	1861-9568				AUG	2018	28	8					1039	1058		10.1007/s11442-018-1540-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-018-1540-7													WOS:000440115800001

Spring Shorebird Migration Chronology and Stopover Duration at an Important Staging Site in the North American Central Flyway	WATERBIRDS												Staging, an essential part of shorebird migration, is when birds concentrate in large numbers to rest and refuel. Abundance estimates at key staging sites offer promise to monitor many transient migrant populations; however, stopover chronology is needed. Point counts were conducted of all shorebirds staging at Chaplin and Reed Lakes, Saskatchewan, Canada (May-June 2014-2017). Stopover durations of individual Sanderlings (Calidris alba) were obtained using automated radio telemetry of individual Sanderlings tagged both locally and in the Gulf of Mexico (April-May 2015-2017). Seventeen Arctic-breeding shorebird species were recorded during point counts. Sanderlings were the most abundant and reached peak numbers during the last week of May. Estimates of Sanderling stopover duration varied by year and estimation method: "true stopover duration" (radio-tagged in Gulf of Mexico with known arrival and departure) was 11.1 days (95% CI = 8.6-13.6); "minimum stopover duration" (radio-tagged at Chaplin Lake with unknown arrival but known departure) was 11.9 days (95% CI = 11.1-12.7); and "estimated stopover duration" (Pradel Survival and Seniority models) was 19.9 days (95% CI = 17.5-22.7). Assuming an average 11-day stopover, we estimated similar to 75,000 Sanderlings (Range = 56,000-91,000) or 12% of the global population use this site during spring migration. These findings highlight the importance of accurate migration chronology to monitor Arctic-breeding shorebird populations.

Traditionally, elevated counts of Escherichia coli are presumed to indicate the presence of sewage, mostly derived from nearby point sources. The relationship between fecal indicator bacteria and Cladophora remains essentially unstudied. This investigation describes the local and regional density of Escherichia coli and enterococci in Cladophora mats along beaches in the four states (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) bordering Lake Michigan. Samples of Cladophora strands collected from 10 beaches (n = 41) were assayed for concentrations of E. coli and enterococci during the summer of 2002. Both E. coli and enterococci were ubiquitous (up to 97% occurrence), with overall log mean densities (+/- standard errors) of 5.3 (+/- 4.8) and 4.8 (+/- 4.5) per g (dry weight). E. coli and enterococci were strongly correlated in southern Lake Michigan beaches (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.73, n = 17) but not in northern beaches (P = 0.892, n = 16). Both E. coli and enterococci survived for over 6 months in sun-dried Cladophora mats stored at 4C; the residual bacteria in the dried alga readily grew upon rehydration. These findings suggest that Cladophora amassing along the beaches of Lake Michigan may be an important environmental source of indicator bacteria and call into question the reliability of E. coli and enterococci as indicators of water quality for freshwater recreational beaches.

We calculated flood characteristics for the upper Guadalupe watershed in central Texas using the Weibull formula and data available from a local gauging station, to the result given by the National Flood Frequency (NFF) program, developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). During the summer of 2002, the upper Guadalupe watershed received a total of 89 cm (35 in.) of precipitation over a one-week period, producing record flooding. The results from both the NFF program and the calculation of return intervals using gauging station data are compared to the measured peak flows for the summer of 2002. The peak discharges predicted by both the NFF model and from the USGS gauging station data are much higher than the recorded discharge. There may be an increase of flow inputs to the Guadalupe River between the locations of the gauging station and where the flood estimate was made. Assuming an increase from tributaries into Canyon Lake, the estimate of peak discharge obtained from USGS data much more closely matches the recorded flow than the results from the NFF program.					; Curran, Joanna/B-4603-2011	Curran, Joanna/0000-0002-4011-2803; 													0272-3646					SEP-OCT	2005	26	5					396	408		10.2747/0272-3646.26.5.396	http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0272-3646.26.5.396													WOS:000238276300005

BIOGEOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO STRATIFICATION AND OVERTURN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Mono Lake is a terminal, saline lake that became ectogenically meromictic in 1982-1983 and remained stratified until November 1988. During this period, the monimolimnion remained anoxic and nearly isothermal, while the upper mixolimnion was well oxygenated and exhibited a seasonal thermal regime. Dissolved sulfide and methane increased in the monimolimnion as a result of diffusive flux from the sediments. Winter mixing down to the chemocline distributed sulfide and methane throughout the mixolimnion. Lakewide inventories of dissolved sulfide and methane reflected the balance between increased concentrations and decreased monimolimnion volume over time. At overturn, the entire water column was isothermal and anoxic. Dissolved sulfide (380 x 10(6) mol) was oxidized in 1 week by molecular oxygen. Methane (12 x 10(6) mol) was removed more slowly by microbial oxidation and ventilation across the air-water interface.

Recent dam constructions on the Yangtze River and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power exert strong effects on the hydrological regimes of this lake. However, few studies have investigated how the land-use changes through time affect the habitat suitability for wintering Anseriformes-the largest community in this region. Thus, it is necessary to timely monitor changes in the habitat quality and understand the potential factors that alter it. In this study, three periods (1995, 2005 and 2014) of typical environmental indicators that have direct impacts on foraging and resting for the Anserformes, including proximity to water (density of lakes, rivers and ponds), human disturbances (density of residences and various road networks), preferred land cover types and food availability (NDVI), are integrated to develop a habitat suitability index model for habitat mapping. The results indicate that long-term lake shrinkage in low-water periods led to greatly expanded wetlands in these years, which provided more suitable habitat for migratory waterfowl. The amount of highly suitable habitat in 2014 was nearly twice as much as in 1995. Recent survey data from 1997 to 2013 also revealed an increase in the population size, and confirmed the improvement of habitat suitability in the Poyang Lake region. Spatial analysis revealed that land use changes contributed most to the improved habitat coverage between 1995 and 2014. However, the relative significances of these transformations for highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats are strikingly different. Increases in wetland and paddy field area are the main reasons for explaining these improvements, respectively.

J	EWINS, PJ; WESELOH, DVC				EWINS, PJ; WESELOH, DVC			EFFECTS ON PRODUCTIVITY OF SHOOTING OF DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS (PHALACROCORAX-AURITUS) ON PIGEON-ISLAND, LAKE-ONTARIO, IN 1993	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												At least 50 adult double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were shot illegally in early June 1993 at a colony of 818 pairs on Pigeon Island, in eastern Lake Ontario. This constitutes the first documented case of killing of cormorants by humans in the Canadian waters of the lower Great Lakes since cormorant populations began to recover from the effects of organochlorine contaminants. Some birds had been shot at the nest, but others probably fell into the water and were not counted. Disturbance caused by the shooting undoubtedly resulted in additional losses of cormorant eggs and small chicks to predation by gulls (Laridae). Numbers of apparently occupied nests fell by 30% (front 818 to 570) after the shooting incident. Overall reproductive output was less than 0.3 young per apparently occupied nest, compared with a more typical value of 1.6 from a neighbouring island whose cormorants were not impacted. Further, 90% of the reproductive potential was lost at this colony in 1993, compared to only 35% at a nearby reference colony. The shooting resulted in the death of an estimated 3-6% of the adult cormorants at this colony, where breeding numbers have been increasing at an average annual rate of 36% since 1978.																			0380-1330						1994	20	4					761	767		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71193-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71193-X													WOS:A1994PX45300014

In this study we evaluated impacts of programs to harass spring migrating cormorants on the walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery in Brevoort Lake and the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and walleye fisheries at Drummond Island. Cormorant foraging declined significantly (p<0.05) at both locations subsequent to initiation of harassment programs. Overall harassment deterred 90% of cormorant foraging attempts while taking less than 6% lethally on average at each site. Yellow perch were a predominate prey item in number and biomass at both locations. Walleye made up a small proportion of the diet at both locations. However, both walleye and yellow perch abundance increased significantly (p<0.05) at Drummond Island. Walleye abundance at age 3 increased to record levels in 2008 following 3 years of cormorant management at Brevoort Lake. The estimated cormorant consumption of age-1 walleye in the absence of management at Brevoort Lake during 2005 would account for 55% of the record 2006 age-1 walleye population. These results support the hypothesis that cormorant predation on spawning aggregations of sportfish was a significant mortality factor and cormorant management reduced sportfish mortality and increased abundance at both locations. Continuation of harassment programs and fishery assessments will determine whether improvement of targeted sport fisheries through control of spring migrating cormorants is sustainable.

In this study, pollen-based reconstruction with 60 pollen records from mid-latitude region was performed in China. Betula emerged after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when the climate ameliorated gradually. The distribution range was small but increased significantly during the early Holocene. However, when the climate was wet and warm during the mid-Holocene, the distribution range did not continue to expand. The relationships between the percentages of Betula pollen and the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) or its variability were positively correlated, while those of Betula and Pinus had opposite trends in the study region. Besides, the post-glacial distribution dynamics of Betula platyphylla and Betula dahurica were influenced by climate change which were simulated by species distribution models (SDMs). We conclude that birch distribution in mid-latitudinal northern China was mainly driven by the EASM or its variability, especially during the LGM and early Holocene when the climate was unstable, while the replacement by Pinus and Quercus occurred during the mid-Holocene when the climate remained stable. The future unstable climate may benefit birch development.

Within the cryosphere, there are large expanses of ice in the Antarctic, Arctic and alpine regions that are not regarded as being part of any biome. During the summer, there is significant melt on the surface of glaciers, ice caps and ice shelves, at which point microbial communities become active and play an important role in the cycling of carbon and other elements within the cryosphere. In this review, we suggest that it is time to recognise the cryosphere as one of the biomes of Earth. The cryospheric biome encompasses extreme environments and is typified by truncated food webs dominated by viruses, bacteria, protozoa and algae with distinct biogeographical structures.

We tested the hypothesis that DOC is a factor enhancing spring recruitment of the species by exposing sediments from a humic lake with a 17-year bloom history, to three various DOC additions (two solutions of glucose and one solution of a peat extract). Sediments and lake water were incubated for 14 days at 16A degrees C, in 14:10 h light:dark cycle, with germling and adult cell abundance ascertained in the water every third day, and water parameters every seventh day. Our important findings were that (1) Gonyostomum recruitment was uneven and the period of germination was relatively short; (2) all treatments significantly affected germling occurrence; however, sugar-derived DOC seemed to suppress the recruitment, whereas peat extract improved it. Due to the additional phosphorus load in peat treatment (against phosphorus-free sugar treatments), it is likely that it played a major role in the observed differences, however, our results did not exclude the potential role of peat-derived DOC forms. In conclusion, we proposed that Gonyostomum expansion is supported by enhanced recruitment from sediment seed banks related to water chemistry alterations, driven by the climate change.

Hydrography, dissolved inorganic, particulate and total nutrients, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, (PO4)-P-32-uptake and phytoplankton species were measured. The study period was characterized by wind-induced mixing events, followed by marked nutrient pulses and plankton community responses. Phosphate uptake was highest throughout the study period in the size fraction dominated by bacteria and picocyanobacteria (< 2 mu m) and the proportion of uptake in the size fraction 2-10 mu m remained low (2-6%). Higher phosphate turnover times were observed in a community showing signs of enhanced heterotrophic activity. The bloom of filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae was promoted by a nutrient pulse with an inorganic nutrient ratio (DIN:DIP) of 15. The results show that the quality, frequency and magnitude of the physically forced nutrient pulses have an important role in determining the relative share of the different modes of phosphorus utilization and hence in determining the cyanobacterial bloom intensity and species composition in the Baltic Sea.																			0018-8158					SEP 20	1996	331	1-3					97	108		10.1007/BF00025411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025411													WOS:A1996VR83900010

Wintertime Coastal Upwelling in Lake Geneva: An Efficient Transport Process for Deepwater Renewal in a Large, Deep Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Combining field measurements, 3-D numerical modeling, and Lagrangian particle tracking, we investigated wind-driven, Ekman-type coastal upwelling during the weakly stratified winter period 2017/2018 in Lake Geneva, Western Europe's largest lake (max. depth 309 m). Strong alongshore wind stress, persistent for more than 7 days, led to tilting and surfacing of the thermocline (initial depth 75-100 m). Observed nearshore temperatures dropped by 1 degrees C and remained low for 10 days, with the lowest temperatures corresponding to those of hypolimnetic waters originating from 200 m depth. Nearshore current measurements at 30 m depth revealed dominant alongshore currents in the entire water column (maximum current speed 25 cm s(-1)) with episodic upslope transport of cold hypolimnetic waters in the lowest 10 m mainly during the first 3 days. The observed upwelling dynamics were well reproduced by a 3-D hydrodynamic model (RMSE 0.2 degrees C), whose results indicated that upwelled waters spread over approximately 10% of the lake's main basin surface area. Model-based Lagrangian particle tracking confirmed that upwelled waters originated from far below the thermocline, that is, >150 m depth, and descended back to around 150-200 m depth over a wide area after wind stress ceased. Observational and particle tracking results suggest that wintertime coastal upwelling, which can occur several times during winter, is an overlooked transport process that is less sensitive to the effects of global warming than convective cooling. It can provide an effective but complex 3-D pathway for deepwater renewal in Lake Geneva, and other large, deep lakes with a sufficiently long wind fetch. Plain Language Summary Freshwater lakes are increasingly important as drinking water sources and for societal and economic activities. To maintain good water quality, deepwater renewal is essential for lake ecosystems. Traditionally, convectively driven vertical mixing during wintertime is considered as one of the main processes for deepwater renewal. In deep lakes, this mixing often cannot reach down to the deepest layers. Since this situation is expected to worsen due to climate change-induced warming, a good understanding of alternative deepwater renewal processes is crucial. We investigate wind-driven coastal upwelling of hypolimnetic water during the weakly stratified winter period. The study was carried out in monomictic Lake Geneva, a large, deep lake (depth 309 m), combining field observations, 3-D hydrodynamic modeling, and Lagrangian particle tracking, an effective combination for addressing the complex 3-D upwelling dynamics over a large area of the lake. We show that coastal upwelling can lift water masses from far below the thermocline up to the surface in the nearshore region, where they spend up to 5 days before descending back to the deeper layers. Our results demonstrate that wintertime coastal upwelling, an as yet overlooked transport process, can efficiently contribute to the renewal and aeration of the deepwater layer in deep lakes.

Aside from one previous record for E. canadensis at higher altitude, the above angiosperm species have not been reported at such depths before. These communities were observed throughout two consecutive growing seasons. Plants at these depths received an estimated 0.5-1% of surface light. Besides light, other factors which may have allowed for the existence of these communities were warm summer temperatures in deep water and the presence of oxygen in the sediments during most of the ice-free season.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1986	100	3					354	358																WOS:A1986F597100007

Identification of Dissolved Nonreactive Phosphorus in Freshwater by Precipitation with Aluminum and Subsequent 31P NMR Analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Little information exists on nonreactive phosphorus (nrP) in the water column, because the concentration is much lower than that in the sediment Here we present a novel method for up-concentration and identification of nrP in lake water: nrP is precipitated with poly aluminum chloride and the precipitate is subsequently recovered and dissolved by NaOH. Additional up-concentration by rotary evaporation increases P concentrations up to 5500 times. Furthermore, there is only a low up-concentration of paramagnetic metals. The method is sensitive and easy to use. Bottom water from five Danish lakes was sampled in autumn 2008 and in four of the five lakes orthophosphate monoesters constituted the largest fraction of nrP, (50-86%), whereas DNA-P was the largest fraction in the fifth lake (67%). The pyro-P/poly-P concentration varied between 0 and 33% of nrP in the lakes. Thus, most of the P compounds usually found in lake sediments were also found in the bottom water of these lakes.

In the late summer of 2012, a strong wind-induced upwelling event transported oxygen depleted water to the nearshore zones of northern Lake Erie. Wind speed, duration and direction relative to the shoreline of individual wind events determined the extent of nearshore zone affected by the hypoxic-waters. The upwelling event resulted in adverse water quality along some stretches of the northern shoreline of Lake Erie with persistent anoxia, which was mainly responsible for the mortality of fish.

J	Houser, JN				Houser, Jeffrey N.			Contrasts between channels and backwaters in a large, floodplain river: testing our understanding of nutrient cycling, phytoplankton abundance, and suspended solids dynamics	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												In floodplain rivers, variability in hydraulic connectivity interacts with biogeochemistry to determine the distribution of suspended and dissolved substances. Nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended solids data spanning longitudinal (5 study reaches across 1300 river km), lateral (main channel and backwaters), and temporal (1994-2011) gradients in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) were used to examine the extent to which observed differences between the main channel and backwaters were consistent with expectations based on current understanding of biogeochemical processes in large rivers. For N and P, the results largely conformed to expectations. N concentrations were greater in the main channel than in the backwaters in 82 to 96% of the observations across river reaches. Maximum TP concentrations generally occurred in backwaters during summer, when backwater TP often exceeded that of the main channel. Flux of P from sediments may be a substantial source of water-column P in UMR backwaters in summer. The data for suspended solids and chlorophyll a suggest that some refinements are needed of our understanding of ecosystem processes in large rivers. During low-discharge conditions, concentrations of inorganic suspended solids often were greater in backwaters than in the main channel, suggesting the importance of sediment resuspension. Chlorophyll a concentrations were usually greater in backwaters than in the main channel, but exceptions indicate that phytoplankton abundance in the main channel of the UMR can sometimes be greater than is typically expected for large rivers.

Climate	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom, chrysophyte cyst, benthic cladocera, planktonic cladocera, and chironomid assemblages were studied in the surface sediments of 68 small lakes along an altitudinal gradient from 300 to 2350 m in Switzerland. In addition, 43 environmental variables relating to the physical limnology, geography, catchment characteristics, climate, and water chemistry were recorded or measured for each lake. The explanatory power of each of these predictor variables for the different biological data-sets was estimated by a series of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) and the statistical significance of each model was assessed by Monte Carlo permutation tests. A minimal set of environmental variables was found for each biological data-set by a forward-selection procedure within CCA. The unique, independent explanatory power of each set of environmental variables was estimated by a series of CCAs and partial CCAs. Inference models or transfer functions for mean summer (June, July, August) air temperature were developed for each biological data-set using weighted-averaging partial least squares or partial least squares. The final transfer functions, after data screening, have root mean squared errors of prediction, as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation, of 1.37 degrees C (chironomids), 1.60 degrees C (benthic cladocera), 1.62 degrees C (diatoms), 1.77 degrees C (planktonic cladocera), and 2.23 degrees C (chrysophyte cysts).

The change in behavioral responses, including phototropic responses, may occur at lower concentrations of pollutants, leading to the inhibition of the risk-avoidance response of predatory fish attack and, ultimately, to the change in zooplankton abundance and biodiversity. The biological significance of such changes is quite high since zooplankters form the basis of food chains. This work studies the possibility of biomonitoring the quality of fresh water in Lake Baikal according to the state of the autochthonous mesozooplankton community in summer and winter using a digital holographic camera developed and tested by us in laboratory conditions. This method makes it possible to determine the concentration of plankters in the controlled volume of the DHC and perform photostimulation with different levels of illuminance. The depth profilometry of the phototropic response was compared with the profilometry of plankton concentration, intraspecific diversity of crustaceans according to the Pielou index, and the results of catching using the Juday net in the natural environment of the lake and during the modeling of the anthropogenic impact (introduction of table salt solution into the local area close to the registration probe). The circadian rhythm parameters were determined by the spectral analysis of the long-term registration of the phototropic response dynamics. It was noted that the inhibition of the phototropic response was the most adequate marker of the exogenous impact and the appearance of an alternating factor among the studied indicators of the state of the plankton community, namely, intraspecific diversity, synchronism of circadian rhythms, and response to paired photostimulation. The revealed patterns of behavioral responses of autochthonous zooplankton in natural and artificially modified conditions will allow for the implementation of long-term continuous control over the environmental well-being of water areas, including the collection ponds of treatment facilities, cooling ponds of nuclear power plants, and other water areas in contact with potentially hazardous facilities. The comparison of the identified patterns with the behavioral responses of euryhaline mesozooplankton will expand this method to assess the well-being of salt-water and marine reservoirs under the anthropogenic impact and will make it possible to create a continuous monitoring system.

The seagrass Zostera japonica Asch. & Graebn. is an endangered species in its native range along the northwestern Pacific coast. In this study, we used ecological survey methods and microsatellite analysis to evaluate sexual reproduction and its role in recruitment of Z. japonica populations at Swan Lake lagoon (SLL) and Huiquan Bay (HQB) in northern China. Mixed annual and continuous meadows of Z. japonica at SLL produced a high number of seeds (mean +/- SD: 40 244 +/- 18 666 seeds m(-2)) and formed a relatively stable seed bank (1460 +/- 417 seeds m(-2)) in the sediment. About 41 % of the seed bank and 6% of shoots survived over winter, and recruitment from seeds accounted for 41 +/- 24 %. In contrast, perennial and fragmented Z. japonica at HQB had lower seed production (12 501 +/- 5748 seeds m(-2)) and a much smaller seed bank (10 +/- 6 seeds m(-2)). About 66% of shoots survived over winter, but seedling recruitment was rare at HQB. Thus, relatively large differences in genetic and clonal diversity were predicted between SLL and HQB. Results of the microsatellite analysis of samples collected in 2012 and 2015 showed higher clonal (R) and genetic diversity (H-o) at SLL (2015: R = 1; H-o = 0.55) than at HQB (2015: R = 0.40; H-o = 0.42). These results highlight the role of sexual and asexual reproduction in maintenance and evolutionary connectivity of seagrass populations and emphasize the need to understand local recruitment strategies before starting restoration and management projects.					; Wang, Shaoxin/JKH-8763-2023; Zhou, Yi/F-4219-2011; xu, shuai/KFS-8484-2024	Xiaomei, zhang/0000-0002-6530-3825; Zhou, Yi/0000-0001-7300-0173; 													0171-8630	1616-1599				MAR 19	2020	638						65	81		10.3354/meps13248	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps13248													WOS:000521740400006

Using a new procedure based on ion chromatography, we determined spatiotemporal distributions of PO4-P concentrations and biogeochemical parameters in the north basin of mesotrophic Lake Biwa in 2018-2019 to clarify the effects of horizontal transportation of nutrients on phytoplankton growth. Above 20 m depth, chlorophyll a peaked in June-July and October-November for 2018 and 2019 while PO4-P concentrations usually remained <0.03 mu mol L-1. Distinct subsurface PO4-P maxima of >0.07 mu mol L-1 were detected at 5-10 m depths in May 2019 along a transect connecting littoral and pelagic sites. At >40 m depths, PO4-P concentrations increased with depth and were frequently elevated near the bottom, displaying inconsistent seasonality. In both years, increases in PO4-P throughout the water column in May were followed by phytoplankton blooms; PO4-P increased before the autumnal phytoplankton bloom in 2018 but not in 2019. The spring bloom may be related to horizontal transportation of PO4-P from the littoral slope by wind-driven internal waves, whereas the autumnal bloom may be fed by nutrients transported from the hypolimnion by vertical convection. Phosphate enrichment experiments showed that phytoplankton growth was restricted at PO4-P concentration <0.014 mu mol L-1 and reached potential maximum growth at >0.05 mu mol L-1. The horizontal transportation of PO4-P by internal waves in spring may play an important role in supplying sufficient nutrients to the euphotic zone in the pelagic region, resulting in enhanced phytoplankton production.					; Liu, Xin/AAE-9053-2021; Maruo, Masahiro/HTT-1182-2023	Liu, Xin/0000-0002-6660-4486; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				DEC 31	2025	15	1								10.1080/20442041.2025.2449763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2025.2449763		MAR 2025											WOS:001449506600001

Implementing isotopic and remote sensing techniques to identify inter-catchment groundwater exchanges, in a geologically complex lake catchment	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies				Identifying groundwater preferential flows, submerged spring discharges and intercatchment groundwater exchanges is important for estimating water budget components and designing integrated water resources management plans in various scales. The study area is Trichonis lake catchment which is located in W. Greece and incorporates a deep and large water body, Trichonis lake that has a tectonic origination and a surface area of 97 Km(2). The hydrogeologic conditions in this particular catchment are complex since highly tectonized limestone formations dominate and present well developed folds, faults and karst phenomena. The broader area of the lake belongs to NATURA 2000 protection Network mainly because of the significant wetlands located around the lake and therefore a thorough hydrologic analysis of the area as well as designing a sustainable water management scheme are essential. Under this framework, satellite images have been utilized to illustrate potential groundwater flows and detailed tectonic surfaces that can be related to groundwater paths. GIS programs have been used to elaborate the satellite data and provide springs location and high soil moisture zones through thermal mapping. Isotopic study of the broader area has been conducted by collecting water samples from specific points of interest, including springs, streams and the lake, on a wide spatial and temporal distribution. The delta O-18 values have been recorded in the water samples and a statistical analysis provided the potential recharge areas' altitudes for each sampling location. The isotopic values have been projected on the geotectonic map of the area and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis occurred in order to develop clusters of the sampling locations that have common recharge areas. This process provided preferential groundwater flow directions which clearly illustrated out-of-the-catchment contribution and this was in agreement with bibliographic references and water balance estimations. The results from this study have been taken into consideration by the local water management authorities and have been used for the designing of the lake's integrated water resources management plan.

The bridge was designed and built in 1965 according to the 1961 American Association of State Highway Officials specifications, which did not consider earthquake-induced forces or displacements. The bridge consists of reinforced concrete bents supporting steel plate welded girders. The bents are supported on cast-in-place concrete piles and pile caps. A seismic retrofit design was developed using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, which was implemented in the summer of 2000 and the summer of 200 1, to improve the displacement ductility of the bridge. The seismic retrofit included column jacketing, as well as wrapping of the bent cap and bent cap-column joints for confinement, flexural, and shear strength increase. This paper describes the specifications developed for the CFRP composite column jackets and composite bent wrap. The specifications included provisions for materials, constructed thickness based on strength capacity, and an environmental durability reduction factor. Surface preparation, finish coat requirements, quality assurance provisions, which included sampling and testing, and constructability issues regarding the application of fiber composite materials in the retrofit of concrete bridges are also described.					; Pantelides, Chris/AAH-5988-2021	Pantelides, Chris/0000-0003-3309-3488; 													1090-0268	1943-5614				JAN-FEB	2004	8	1					88	96		10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2004)8:1(88)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2004)8:1(88)													WOS:000188535500011

Hybrids have often been considered less fit than their parental species. In the present study, we observed that the Daphnia community of a small lake was dominated by a single D. galeata x D. longispina hybrid clone, during two consecutive years. Notably, in artificial community set-ups consisting of several clones representing parental species and other hybrids, this hybrid clone took over within about ten generations. Neither the fitness assay conducted under different temperatures, or under crowded and non-crowded environments, nor the carrying capacity test revealed any outstanding life history parameters of this hybrid clone. However, under simulated winter conditions (i.e. low temperature, food and light), the hybrid clone eventually showed a higher survival probability and higher fecundity compared to parental species. Hybrid superiority in cold-adapted traits leading to an advantage of overwintering as parthenogenetic lineages might consequently explain the establishment of successful hybrids in natural communities of the D. longispina complex. In extreme cases, like the one reported here, a superior hybrid genotype might be the only clone alive after cold winters. Overall, superiority traits, such as enhanced overwintering here, might explain hybrid dominance in nature, especially in extreme and rapidly changing environments. Although any favoured gene complex in cyclic parthenogens could be frozen in successful clones independent of hybridization, we did not find similarly successful clones among parental species. We conclude that the emergence of the observed trait is linked to the production of novel recombined hybrid genotypes.

The stoichiometry of the reactions allows us to calculate an electron transfer budget for the summer stratification period in the lake, as well as in benthic chambers and sealed jars. The average decomposition rate measured as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was 5.33 mmol m-2 d-1. The proportions of decomposition accounted for by the various electron acceptors varied both during the summer, as well as from year to year. On average, oxygen accounted for 43% of DIC production, while the processes involving sulfate, nitrate, iron and methane formation together accounted for 20%. Despite conservative assumptions we could not account for 37% of the DIC production. The general pattern, including excess DIC production, was also observed in chamber studies conducted over shallow-water sediments and in sealed-jar experiments. Data on burial rates of reduced iron minerals indicate that such minerals are not sufficient to account for the discrepancy in the electron budget. Our analysis suggests that another electron acceptor such as organic carbon reduction, either via fermentation or selective oxidation, is the most likely explanation of excess DIC production.																			0168-2563						1993	19	3					149	172																WOS:A1993LK03200002

Dissolved silica retention and its impact on eutrophication in a complex of mountain reservoirs	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This paper reports on studies conducted during 2005 in the ecosystem of the Solina-Myczkowce mountain complex of mesotrophic reservoirs on the San River, SE Poland. Of the 1,950 t of dissolved silica calculated to flow into the reservoirs in the course of the year, c. 20% of the load was retained in the reservoirs. However, most of this retention took place in the lower Myczkowce Reservoir. Far-reaching depletion to below 10 mu M L-1 of silicate was noted during the summer in the epilimnetic waters of the two reservoirs. In turn, the hypolimnion was seen to go through an enrichment process connected with sedimentation and releases from sediment. The observed depletion causes a decrease in the DSi:DIP ratio in the euphotic zone of the reservoirs, with simultaneous growth of non-siliceous algae expressed as chl a concentration.

Late Holocene relative sea level rise and the Neoglacial history of the Greenland ice sheet	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												In West Greenland, early and mid Holocene relative sea level (RSL) fall was replaced by late Holocene RSL rise during the Neoglacial, after 4-3 cal. ka BP (thousand calibrated years before present). Here we present the results of an isolation basin RSL study completed near to the coastal town of Sisimiut, in central West Greenland. RSL fell from 14 m above sea level at 5.7 cal. ka BP to reach a lowstand of -4.0 m at 2.3-1.2 cal. ka BP, before rising by an equivalent amount to present. Differences in the timing and magnitude of the RSL lowstand between this and other sites in West and South Greenland record the varied interplay of local and non-Greenland RSL processes, notably the reloading, of the Earth's crust caused by a Neoglacial expansion of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and the subsidence associated with the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet forebulge. This means that the timing of the sea level lowstand cannot be used to infer directly when the GIS advanced during the Neoglacial. The rise in Late Holocene RSL is contrary to recently reported bedrock uplift in the Sismiut area, based on repeat GPS surveys. This indicates that a belt of peripheral subsidence around the current ice sheet margin was more extensive in the late Holocene, and that there has been a switch from subsidence to uplift at some point in the last thousand years or so.

The main task of the article is to estimate long-term changes and find the best method for the restoration of good ecological status. Lake Verevi (surface 12.6 ha, mean depth 3.6 m, maximum depth 11 m, drainage area 1.1 km(2), water exchange 0.63-times per year) is a hypertrophic hard-water lake located in town Elva (6400 inhabitants). Long-term complex limnological investigations have taken place since 1929. The lake has been contaminated by irregular discharge of urban wastewaters from oxidation ponds since 1978, flood from streets, and infiltrated waters from the surrounding farms. The so-called spring meromixis occurred due to extremely warm springs in recent years. The index value of buffer capacity of Lake Verevi calculated from natural conditions is on the medium level. Water properties were analysed according to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. According to the classification, water quality as a long-term average of surface layers is moderate-good, but the water quality of bottom layers is bad. Values in deeper layers usually exceed 20-30 times the calculated reference values by Vighi and Chiaudani's model. Naturally, at the beginning of the 20th century the limnological type of the lake was moderately eutrophic. During the 1980s and 1990s the ecosystem was out of balance by abiotic characteristics as well as by plankton indicators. Rapid fluctuations of species composition and abundance can be found in recent years. Seasonal variations are considerable and species composition differs remarkably also in the water column. The dominating macrophyte species vary from year to year. Since the annual amount of precipitation from the atmosphere onto the lake surface is several times higher, the impact of swimmers could be considered irrelevant. Some restoration methods were discussed. The first step, stopping external pollution, was completed by damming the inlet. Drainage (siphoning) of the hypolimnetic water is discussed. Secondary pollution occurs because Fe:P values are below the threshold. The authors propose to use phosphorus precipitation and hypolinmetic aeration instead of siphoning.					; Kõiv, Toomas/H-3466-2016; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Kisand, Anu/G-9758-2017; Koiv, Toomas/H-3466-2016	Kisand, Anu/0000-0001-5175-9031; Ott, Ingmar/0000-0002-9036-1736; Koiv, Toomas/0000-0002-0051-3952													0018-8158					SEP 15	2005	547						1	20		10.1007/s10750-005-4138-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4138-x													WOS:000232760300002

The study is largely based on correlations from long-term monitoring series in the period 1975-2002. Production of young in the harlequin duck was significantly correlated with food resources (the blackfly, Simulium vittatum) of the river, as was the recruitment of brown trout to the angling stock. In Barrow's goldeneye, which uses both the lake and the river, dispersion of adults in spring and young in August was influenced by the availability of aquatic insects in each habitat. The dispersion of Barrow's goldeneye tracks the availability of aquatic insects in each of these two main habitats. Introduced Amercian mink, Mustela vison, may have affected spring numbers and dispersion of harlequin ducks, but the evidence was not conclusive. Numbers of both duck species and the trout (as CPUE) were relatively stable, although a sharp drop in numbers followed by slow recovery was observed in Barrow's goldeneye, and an increase was observed in harlequin ducks in the first year of study.

Blooms of this alga, which typically occur in autumn, are associated with fish deaths in this lake. Experiments using 15 phytoplankton and 5 zooplankton isolated from Liyu Lake indicate that these plankton exhibit various susceptibilities to B. braunii. A close correlation between the degree of susceptibility tested in the laboratory and the absence of certain phytoplankton during B. braunii blooms in the lake was observed, suggesting allelopathic effects. Isolation, identification, and verification with authentic compounds indicated that allelochemicals were a mixture of free fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic, oleic, linolic, and palmitic acids. Compared with other phytoplankton isolates, B. braunii produced significantly higher amounts of free fatty acids, particularly of oleic and alpha-linolenic acids. The role of these fatty acids in favoring dominance of B. braunii in the natural environment was elucidated.

Recent excavations at Kanaljorden in Sweden, however, have revealed disarticulated human crania intentionally placed at the bottom of a former lake. The adult crania exhibited antemortem blunt force trauma patterns differentiated by sex that were probably the result of interpersonal violence; the remains of wooden stakes were recovered inside two crania, indicating that they had been mounted. Taphonomic factors suggest that the human bodies were manipulated prior to deposition. This unique site challenges our understanding of the handling of the dead during the European Mesolithic.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. As grazers on picoplankton and nanoplankton, planktonic ciliates form an important link in pelagic food webs. Ciliate communities may be controlled by predation by metazooplankton. In eutrophic systems, however, where the number of large crustaceans is often low, the mechanisms that regulate ciliate dynamics have rarely been described. 2. We conducted an enclosure experiment with natural and screened (145 mu m) summer plankton communities to investigate the effect of the small-sized crustacean zooplankton on ciliate community structure and the microbial loop in a shallow eutrophic lake. 3. The removal of the larger fraction of crustaceans initiated a decrease in total ciliate abundance. At the community level, we observed a substantial increase in large-sized predacious ciliates (>100 mu m) and a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of smaller ciliates (<2040 mu m) that were mostly bacterivores and bacterio-herbivores. The compositional shift in the ciliate community, however, did not cascade down to the level of bacteria and edible phytoplankton.

The sedimentological, geochemical, pollen and chironomid data suggest that glaciers occupied the lake's catchment during the cold and dry MIS 2 and document a change in ice extent around 23.5-18 cal ka bp. Subsequently, meltwater input, sediment supply and erosional activity decreased as local glaciers progressively melted. The vegetation around the lake comprised open, herb and grass-dominated tundra-steppe until the Bolling-Allerod, but shows a distinct change to probably moister conditions around 17-16 cal ka bp. Local glaciers completely disappeared during the Bolling-Allerod, when summer air temperatures were similar to today and low shrub tundra became established. The Younger Dryas is confined by distinct shifts in the pollen and chironomid records pointing to drier conditions. The Holocene is characterised by a denser vegetation cover, stabilised soil conditions and decreased minerogenic input, especially during the local thermal maximum between c. 10 and 5 cal ka bp. Subsequently, present-day vegetation developed and summer air temperatures decreased to modern, except for two intervals, which may represent the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period.					; Syrykh, Liudmila/K-8331-2018; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Nazarova, Larisa/C-8926-2014; Andreev, Andrei/J-2701-2015; Fedorov, Grigory/N-5788-2019; Brill, Dominik/O-2442-2015	Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; Gromig, Raphael/0000-0001-9217-4259; Lenz (nee Baumer), Marlene Margit/0000-0002-5352-3900; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Nazarova, Larisa/0000-0003-4145-9689; Andreev, Andrei/0000-0002-8745-9636; Fedorov, Grigory/0000-0003-2269-4501; Brill, Dominik/0000-0001-8637-4641; Scheidt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9370-2700; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Syrykh, Liudmila/0000-0003-2076-8570													0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2022	37	5			SI		818	835		10.1002/jqs.3400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3400		NOV 2021											WOS:000723258100001
J	Chernet, T				Chernet, Tadiwos			Geology and hydrothermal resources in the northern Lake Abaya area (Ethiopia)	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The northern Lake Abaya area located in the southern part of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) evidently contains an advective hydrothermal system. Regional extensional tectonics and subsidence that began in Late Miocene was followed by rift margin rhyolitic volcanism which produced extensive ignimbrite succession and rift shoulder trachytic volcanism in Pliocene. The extensional axis of the MER became the locus of volcanic activity in the Quaternary with bimodal basalt - rhyolitic volcanic products in the rift floor. Shallow crustal magma chambers feeding the axial volcanic complexes provide heat for the hydrothermal system which reside in Tertiary volcanic succession and is capped by lacustrine and volcanoclastic graben infill sediments. Duguna Fango rhyolitic volcanic complex which has extruded as much volume of volcanic products as all the other felsic centers put together is the most important heat source for the hydrothermal system and related manifestations. The closed drainage basin centered at Lake Abaya with adjacent plateau receiving over 1500 mm annual precipitation maintains a stable recharge for the prevailing hydrothermal system. Regional ground water flow direction is to the southwest following Bilate River which is the major river draining into the lake flowing parallel to the major NNE-SSW structural pattern of MER. Analyses of remote sensing data provided some insight into how the structural fabric had a control on the distribution of the groups of hydrothermal manifestations identified as hydrothermal fields. Thermal infrared image showed distinct thermal signature over the rift floor where hydrothermal fields are situated as compared to the plateau and areas covered by the cap-rock. A hydrothermal field around Duguna Fango volcanic complex has volcanological favorable setting despite lower inferred reservoir equilibrium geothermometer temperatures on the thermal springs. About 30 km to the south two other hydrothermal fields are located at a latitudinal distance of less than 15 km between each other. The near boiling point spring #6 of Northwest Abaya discharge mature water with highest geothermal fluid - host rock equilibrium geothermometer temperatures which together with a nearby fumarolic activity may be explained as an outflow. Across Chewkare graben the Bolcho and northeast Abaya hydrothermal fields located between Bilate and Gidabo rivers geochemically appear to be from a different high-enthalpy geothermal reservoir probably related to the cluster of felsic volcanic centers such as Chericho, Kilisa. Donga and Werencha. The high temperature springs indicate the existence of at least two geochemically distinct hydrothermal reservoirs in the study area. It remains to be proven weather an up-flow of an advective hydrothermal system centered to the north around Duguna Fango have long distance concealed out flows to the south on the northern shores of Lake Abaya which is the hydrologic depocenter.

J	Hull, V; Parrella, L; Falcucci, M				Hull, Vincent; Parrella, Luisa; Falcucci, Margherita			Modelling dissolved oxygen dynamics in coastal lagoons	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												High frequency dissolved oxygen measurements in Mediterranean coastal lagoons show different dynamics on different time scales. In this paper the seasonal and daily dynamics are analysed and discussed and a continuous simulation model is developed to represent them for the salt lake of Fogliano (Italy). Field and laboratory experiments evidenced that primary production slows down in highly oxygenated and irradiated summer days, acting in feedback regime with the oxygen already present in the media, that wind stress contributes in exceeding the oxygen saturation concentration and that there is a firm correlation between oxygen consumption at the sediment layer and overhanging water temperature. Water temperature, solar radiation and wind regime are the forcing functions of the model; the main state variables are dissolved oxygen and detritus in the pelagic and benthic layers, together with carbon dioxide and vegetal biomass. The slow seasonal and fast diel dynamics are both revealed by the model evidencing detailed aspects of oxygen dynamics in a coherent agreement with field observed data trends. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The annual and seasonal composition of both diets was calculated by number, volume and occurrence methods. Food in relation to fish size was compared by Spearman rank correlation. Interspecific competition was only significant during the summer months when food was abundant. The bottom fauna was classified to accessibility, and utilization of the fauna and electivity is discussed for each species. The similarity of diet between the salmon stocked into Llyn Dwythwch and those in Welsh rivers implies that the former is the result of inheritance rather than from interactive segregation with the lake trout.																				1095-8649					1978	12	3					239	256		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb04170.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb04170.x													WOS:A1978EU51700007

The primary purpose of this 80-year-old facility is water supply. The project is owned by City of Seattle and operated by its Light Department. The Cedar River currently provides about (70) seventy percent of the potable water supply needs to Seattle and several neighboring cities. Reservoir operation also provide for flood control, hydroelectric generation, maintenance of instream flows, and water releases needed to assist in the regulation of Lake Washington which supplies flow to the locks at the Hiram M. Chittenden Lock facility. The Cedar River flows into Chester Morse Lake, which was a natural lake (Cedar Lake) that has been raised by a Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) dam. Immediately adjacent to Chester Morse Lake is the Masonry Pool, which is formed by the Masonry Dam, located approximately one mile downstream from the RCC dam. Water flows from the Masonry Pool through power tunnel and two penstocks to the Cedar Falls power generating station, where the water returns to the Cedar River. The Cedar River then flows downstream to Landsburg where a diversion dam is located to enable Seattle Public Utilities to divert water to Lake Youngs, a primary water storage reservoir. Water that is not diverted at Landsburg flows to Lake Washington. There are screening systems, and chlorination and fluoridation stations located at Landsburg. There is, however, no filtration system on the Cedar water supply. Strict watershed control programs, and natural settling in the reservoirs maintain water quality. The Masonry reservoir is normally operated with flows through the power tunnel and releases from the low-level outlet. Unusually high flows or flooding conditions are handled through spillway releases. The power tunnel is currently operating using the original intake gates and penstock gate valves. In their current condition, these gates and valves will not close under emergency conditions, such as maximum reservoir level and a conduit break. To provide flow control capabilities under emergency conditions, a new Intake Gate Shaft was constructed approximately 150 feet downstream of the existing intake at the south abutment of the Masonry Dam. The new intake shaft is located on an existing bench cut for an abandoned emergency spillway, which is above the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) water level. The new intake shaft included boring an 11-foot-diameter, 94-foot-deep shaft extending from the existing tunnel level up to the top of the abandoned emergency spillway bench. A fixed wheel gate was installed at the bottom of the shaft within the existing tunnel. The new gate is capable of closing with reservoir water level at its maximum elevation of 1567 and a maximum flow of 3,000 cubic feet per second. This provides for protection of Seattle's water supply, even in case of penstock failure.																					1-884575-16-1				2000							19	32																WOS:000176360100003

As part of an effort to restore Lake Michigan's lake trout, which were extirpated in the 1950s, yearling lake trout have been released over the MLRC since the mid-1980s and fall gill net censuses began to show large numbers of lake trout in spawning condition beginning about 1999. We report the first evidence of viable egg deposition and successful lake trout fry production at these deep reefs. Because the area's existing bathymetry and habitat were too poorly known for a priori selection of sampling sites, we used hydroacoustics to locate concentrations of large fish in the fall; fish were congregating around slopes and ridges. Subsequent observations via unmanned submersible confirmed the large fish to be lake trout. Our technological objectives were driven by biological objectives of locating where lake trout spawn, where lake trout fry were produced, and what fishes ate lake trout eggs and fry. The unmanned submersibles were equipped with a suction sampler and electroshocker to sample eggs deposited on the reef, draw out and occasionally catch emergent fry, and collect egg predators (slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus). We observed slimy sculpin to eat unusually high numbers of lake trout eggs. Our qualitative approaches are a first step toward quantitative assessments of the importance of lake trout spawning on the MLRC.

Vase-shaped microfossil biostratigraphy with new data from Tasmania, Svalbard, Greenland, Sweden and the Yukon	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The recent revision of the Cryogenian lower boundary from 850 Ma to 720 Ma has nearly doubled the duration of the Tonian Period to 280 Myrs, an interval longer than the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras combined. Although subdivision of the Tonian will likely emphasize chemostratigraphy, the relatively rich fossil record of this time period may also be useful. In particular, vase-shaped microfossils (VSMs) occur globally and often abundantly in a variety of lithofacies, exhibit a variety of preservational modes, and are stratigraphically constrained by the two major carbon isotopic events of the Tonian Period, the Bitter Springs and Islay anomalies. VSMs have been used as informal, grade-level indicators of late Tonian age (e.g. ca. 800-700 Ma) for several decades but here, based on new data from an assemblage in northwestern Tasmania and restudy of samples from Svalbard, Greenland, Sweden and the Yukon, we report a species-level faunal assemblage indicative of the interval ca. 789 to 729 Ma. Species -level VSM biostratigraphy presents an opportunity for potential biostratigraphic subdivision of the lengthy Tonian Period and is particularly useful in successions where chemostratigraphy and radiometric age constraints are absent. Eight taxa are described from shales and early diagenetic cherts of the Black River Dolomite, Togari Group, Tasmania, including seven previously named species (Bombycion micron, Bonniea dacruchares, Bonniea pytinaia, Cycliocyrillium simplex, Cycliocyrillium torquata, Melanocyrillium hexodiadema and Palaeoarcella athanata), and one newly described genus and species Pakupaku kabin n. gen et n. sp.

After Chaoborus flavicans became established in 1974, the species composition of zooplankton in Lake Lenore changed. Diaptomus nevadensis disappeared and densities of Diaptomus sicilis were reduced. 2. A transplant experiment showed the D. nevadensis could survive in Lake Lenore water in the absence of Chaoborus. The disappearance of D. nevadensis was probably a consequence of Chaoborus predation. 3. Although densities of Daphnia pulicaria were similar before and after the colonization of C. flavicans, juvenile D. pulicaria began producing neck-teeth during the first summer Chaoborus was present. 4. The seasonal pattern of neck-teeth production by juvenile D. pilicaria did not correlate with density of Chaoborus but rather with a combination of water temperature and Chaoborus density, suggesting that metabolic processes are a component of induction of neck-teeth in this species.

J	Ellis, AW; Marston, ML				Ellis, Andrew W.; Marston, Michael L.			Late 1990s' cool season climate shift in eastern North America	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Changes in the frequency of cold and warm synoptic weather types within eastern North America indicate the occurrence of a cool season climate shift in the late 1990s. This aligns with the timing of shifts toward earlier spring ice out on freshwater lakes within the region and less frequent cold air mass passage over the North American Great Lakes. While a preliminary shift occurred in the early 1980s, a pronounced shift toward more frequent warm weather types during November through April occurred after 1997, when prominent warming of the lower atmosphere over the region began. The late 1990s' climate shift appears linked to middle atmospheric circulation change associated with phase changes for two influential low-frequency climate teleconnections originating within the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. The climate shift, approximately 20 years after warming within the global climate system commenced, further illustrates the importance of climate system variability within anthropogenically driven climate change.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	2020	162	3					1385	1398		10.1007/s10584-020-02798-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02798-z		JUL 2020											WOS:000552593000001

The Hexi Corridor, the Yanqi Basin, the southeastern part of the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin became part of the empire. The expansion of the Han Dynasty was accompanied by the significant intensification of irrigation farming along rivers draining the Qilian, Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses and dating of lake sediments and shorelines revealed that four large lakes in the region experienced falling levels, or were almost or completely desiccating. The level of Zhuyeze Lake was falling rapidly ca. 2100 years before present (a BP), and the accumulation of lake sediments was replaced by an alluvial fan setting in large parts of the basin. Lake Eastern Juyan desiccated ca. 1700 a BP. Lake Bosten experienced low levels and increasing salinities at ca. 2200 a BP. Lake sediments in the Lop Nur region were mostly replaced by aeolian sands during a period of near-desiccation at 1800 a BP. In contrast, records from fifteen lakes farther in the west, north or south of the Han Dynasty realm indicate relatively wet climate conditions ca. 2000 years ago. Thus, dramatic landscape changes including the near and complete desiccation of large lakes in the arid western part of today's China probably resulted from the withdrawal of water from tributaries during the Han Dynasty. These changes likely represent the earliest man-made environmental disasters comparable to the recent Aral-Sea crisis.

Southwest China has experienced a long history of human activities in terms of deforestation and agricultural development. Here we present a continuous fossil pollen record covering the past 2,100 years from Beihai Wetland in western Yunnan Province, for a better understanding of regional vegetation history and potential human activities. The pollen results indicate that the forest components show decreasing trends, includingAlnusdominated deciduous broadleaved forest and evergreen broadleaved forest represented by evergreenQuercus. On the other hand, herbs such as Poaceae andArtemisiaexpanded along with the decline of forest, especially during the period afterad1120. The results of ordination analysis further confirm such a pattern in which the first PCA component (PC1, capturing 42.2% of total variance) represents an increasing trend, which is subsequently interpreted as an index of human activities. Our findings show broadly identical patterns to previously published sedimentary records from Yunnan as well as historical documents. The human activities increased following the expansion in regional population, in the form of deforestation and regional agricultural development. They may also have caused the expansion of herbs, especially Poaceae, which replaced forest. Therefore, as indicated by the fossil pollen record from the Beihai Wetland, human activities in southwest China increased gradually during the past 2,100 years and more rapidly afterad1120. Results of sediment influx and grain size analyses showed generally consistent patterns with the signs of summer monsoons captured by stable oxygen isotope records from stalagmites, indicating limited influence from human activities within the wetland system compared to the regional landscape.

The grain-size hydrological significance for the marshes' deposits was first interpreted by quantitative analyses of 128 modern samples. The results indicate that the sand fraction exhibits a higher level significance to modern water-level conditions than other grain-size parameters. Thus, the sand accumulation rates of the six cores were calculated and employed to reconstruct the Holocene hydrological regime of the marshes on the plain. Based on the cluster analysis, it can be identified that three higher water-level stages occurred during 6.2-5.6 thousand yr BP, 5.6-4.5 thousand yr BP, and 2.8-2.4 thousand yr BP, whereas four lower water-level stages occurred during similar to 8.0-6.2 thousand yr BP, 4.5-2.8 thousand yr BP, 2.4-0.7 thousand yr BP, and 0.7-0 thousand yr BP, respectively. Considering the prevalent monsoon climate on the modern Sanjiang Plain, it is reasonable to believe that the local water-level fluctuations were mainly regulated by the EASM variation rather than local factors including flooding, waterway modification, depression infilling, and human activities. The higher water-level stages were linked to a stronger EASM and vice versa. This study provides essential background datasets for understanding the potential controls on the marsh development and degradation on the Sanjiang Plain.

A hydrological reconstruction based on elemental ratios, such as Rubidium/Strontium (Rb/Sr) and Zirconium/Rubidium (Zr/Rb), and grain-size distribution for the period of 22.8-7.4 ka was derived from the Dajiuhu basin in central eastern China. The reconstruction shows that there were some small wet-dry fluctuations within the basin between 22.8 and 17.5 ka, but an abrupt wetting after 17.5 ka, with a maximum occurring around 15.0 ka, then a drying trend until the early Holocene. This pattern parallels the zonal gradient of sea surface temperature (SST) across the tropical Pacific, which suggests that wet conditions in the Dajiuhu basin respond to the decreased SST zonal gradient. A marked decrease in the tropical Pacific SST zonal gradient, seen as an El Nino-like state, could lead to an anomalous anticyclonic circulation at the Western Pacific and a southward excursion of the Western Pacific Subtropical High, which favors the occurrence of wet conditions in central eastern China. Meanwhile, this El Nino-like state could sharpen the SST meridional gradient between the tropics and the extratropics, and then shift the upper tropospheric westerlies southward, which in turn induces a prolonged Mei-yu and more precipitation in central eastern China. Overall, it is concluded that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation-like states might be a major forcing for hydrological changes in central eastern China during the last deglaciation.

This research mainly focuses on glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in a well-dated sediment core that covers the last similar to 14.1 ka from Hurleg Lake in the Qaidam Basin, combined with grain size and organic element characteristics, to explore the climate and landscape evolution under the influence of potential forcing. Based on the variations in core sedimentary facies and careful calibrations selection, this study reveals that Hurleg Lake experienced a warm-dry climate in the last deglaciation (14.1-11.2 cal ka BP), a cold-wet climate in the early Holocene (11.2-9.3 cal ka BP), a warm-wet climate in the mid-Holocene (9.3-3.5 cal ka BP), and a cool-dry climate in the late Holocene (after 3.5 cal ka BP). Our study suggests that the moisture evolution in the Hurleg Lake area was controlled by the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and exhibits a typical "monsoon model", and the modern climate is drier than that in the mid-Holocene. The weakening of ASM since the mid-Holocene has caused the ASM boundary to retreat southeastward to the modern one. Therefore, long-term declines in temperature and precipitation may lead to vegetation deterioration, glacier advancement, and aeolian activity exacerbation, which in turn influence regional ecological landscape.

Detection of ancient irrigation canals of Deir El-Hagar playa, Dakhla Oasis, Egypt, using Egyptsat-1 data	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												Dakhla Oasis is the second provincial oasis in Al-Wadi El-Gedid Governorate in the Western Desert of Egypt. Dakhla contains several springs and wells, the most important of which are Mut Wells. Deir El -Hagar playa, located about 45 km to the northwest of Mut, the capital of the oasis, is the most important playa where the Roman Deir El-Hagar Temple is located. The MidPleistocene to Holocene exposed lacustrine sediments provide evidence for a more humid climate than that present today. The main aim of this work is to use the High Pass Filter (HPF) image processing technique to enhance and extract archaeological remains and ancient irrigation canals from an Egyptsat-1 2010 satellite image in addition to link between the locations of these canals and the source of the water that replenished these canals. The enhanced images as well as the 3D prospective view indicate that the playa is a semicircular basin covered by extensive lake deposits that owed its water to the natural flowing springs, located 2 km to the south, and rainfall over the depression during the Terminal Paleolithic and Neolithic times. The significance of this research is to highlight how our ancestors were brilliant so as to utilize the local resources to allow water to be conveyed from its source to its destination where it will be fully utilized in irrigation.

Lignin biomarkers in TOM, which exclusively derive from terrestrial vegetation, were used as biomarkers for the presence and source origin of TOM-and for Hg due to their close associations-in sediments. In the two flooded Gabbro and Sandgirt lakes, we observed drastic increases in total mercury concentrations, T-[Hg], in sediments, which temporally coincided with the time of reservoir impoundment as assessed by Pb-210 age dating. In the natural Atikonak lake sediments, on the other hand, T-[Hg] showed no such step-increase but gradually and slowly increased until present. T-[Hg] increases in lake sediments after flooding were also associated with a change in the nature of TOM: biomarker signatures changed to typical signatures of TOM from vegetated terrestrial landscape surrounding the lakes, and indicate a change to TOM that was much less degraded and typical of forest soil organic horizons. We conclude that T-[Hg] increase in the sediments of the two flooded reservoirs was the result of flooding of surrounding forests, whereby mainly surface organic horizons and upper soil horizons were prone to erosion and subsequent re-sedimentation in the reservoirs. The fact that T-[Hg] was still enriched 40 years after reservoir impoundment indicates prolonged response time of lake Hg and sediment loadings after reservoir impoundments.					; Teisserenc, Roman/C-7093-2011	Lucotte, Marc/0000-0002-6360-2979; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				APR	2014	118	1-3					21	34		10.1007/s10533-013-9902-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9902-9													WOS:000333080400002

Five species are listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Madtoms as a group are the smallest ictalurids, with nearly 70% of the species reaching less than 100 mm standard length (SL). Madtoms exhibit life history traits not unlike other members of the family Ictaluridae, including nocturnal life styles, relatively low annual fecundities, large embryo and hatchling sizes, cavity nesting, summer nesting seasons, extreme parental care, head-to-tail spawning positions, and benthic habitations. The constraint of being small probably accounts for many of the differences between madtoms and other ictalurids including a relatively short-life, a largely invertebrate diet, and a low lifetime fecundity. Most madtoms do not live beyond 3-4 years, although extremes include three annual species and another six species that live 5+ years. Diet includes mostly insects, some crustaceans, and occasionally crayfishes or fishes. Feeding activity is primarily nocturnal or crepuscular with peaks in feeding occurring at dawn and dusk. Mean annual absolute fecundity (ovarian) ranges from 24 and 30 oocytes per female in small (<60 mm SL) species to 378 in the stonecat Noturus flavus, the largest species. The largest species, stonecat, is more fecund than congeners in number of progeny per female, but mature females are larger and produce slightly fewer oocytes per gram body weight. Species on the lower end of the size continuum mature in their first year; whereas, the largest species mature later in life (2-4 years). All nests with egg clutches have been found in cavities beneath stones, logs and boards or in cans, bottles, and bivalve shells, and are guarded predominantly by males. Annual mean nest clutch production barely exceeds 100 embryos when clutch sizes across the 18 studied species are averaged. Longevity and maturation data indicate that both iteroparity and semelparity occur in madtoms. The flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris is the epigean sister group to madtoms and the two genera share a number of reproductive traits (e.g., male parental care only) that differ from those observed in species of bullheads Ameirus. Madtoms are among the least fecund of North American freshwater fishes and their fertilized eggs are among the largest reported outside the Salmonidae. Aspects of natural history requiring further research include: 1) quantification of spawning behaviors, 2) nest construction and differential participation of the sexes, 3) social behaviors, 4) contribution of females in parental care, 5) number of clutches spawned per season by an individual female and number of lifetime clutches produced, 6) behavior and distribution of young after leaving the nest, 7) critical diurnal habitats, 8) movements or migrations, 9) nocturnal behaviors, 10) winter habitat occurrence, 11) interactions with other organisms, 12) nest fidelity in subsequent breeding seasons, 13) geographic and population variation in life history traits, and 14) potential phylogenetic constraints on life history traits.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						51	101																WOS:000086864000005

Understanding the evolution of a small-volume silicic fissure eruption: Puketerata Volcanic Complex, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					6th International-Association-of Volcanology-and-Chemistry-of-the-Earth's-Interior (IAVCEI) International Maar Conference (IMC)	JUL 30-AUG 03, 2016	Changchun, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Assoc Volcanol & Chem Earths Interior				The Puketerata Volcanic Complex formed as a result of a series of rhyolitic eruptions along a 2.5 km long NE-trending eruptive fissure at the southern margin of Maroa Volcanic Centre (Whakamaru caldera) at 16.5 ka. Initial deep-seated explosions were excavated and widen the pre-existing volcanic structures associated to earlier basaltic activity. The following emplacement of two lava domes and associated shallow-seated phreatomagmatic activity produced a widespread tephra blanket characterized by alternating surge and fall dominated pyroclastic units. The silicic magma (73% SiO2) erupted during the Puketerata activity was highly degassed, where explosive fragmentation was driven only by the interaction with external water. The lava domes and ejecta ring makes up more than two-thirds (98 x 10(6) m(3) DRE) of the total eruptive volume (similar to 143 x 10(6) m(3) DRE). The compound ring structures surrounding the larger dome totally overlap the underlying volcanic landforrns that formed during the initial phase. The ejecta ring around the larger dome represents a complex landform, which predominantly consists of outwardly thinning pyroclastic breccias forming fan-shape bodies relating to the series of destruction of the larger dome. Despite the relatively large combined dispersal area of the pyroclastic deposits generated by the entire activity (235 km(2)), the volume of single fall beds do not suggest individual explosive events exceeded VEI 2-3. The volcanic hazards associated with such small-volume volcanoes are largely ignored despite these eruptions being more frequent than eruption characterized by caldera collapses. The example of Puketerata suggests that small-volume volcanism often exhibits activity producing fissures, whereas the varied advancement of dykes influenced by external factors makes the course of the eruptions unpredictable in terms of geometry of vents and eruption styles.

Viruses are a major cause of recreationally-associated waterborne diseases linked to pools, lakes, ponds, thermal pools/spas, rivers, and hot springs. They can make their way into waters through the accidental release of fecal matter, body fluids (saliva, mucus), or skin flakes by symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers. We present an updated overview of epidemiological data on viral outbreaks, a project motivated, among other things, by the availability of improved viral detection methodologies. Special attention is paid to outbreak investigations (source of the outbreak, pathways of transmission, chlorination/disinfection). Epidemiological studies on incidents of viral contamination of swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions are also reviewed.

Changes in the crustacean communities of the central basin of Lake Erie during the first full year of the Bythotrephes longimanus invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The exotic predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus was first observed in Lake Erie on 19 September, 1985. During the early summer immediately prior to its appearance, the cladoceran community in the central basin of Lake Erie was characterized by large populations of Bosmina longirostris, Eubosmina coregoni, Daphnia mendotae, and Daphnia retrocurva, with the latter three species persisting throughout August and September, along with Diaphanosoma spp. Community composition during early summer 1986 was similar to that of the previous year, but densities of all cladocerans decreased dramatically coincident with the appearance of Bythotrephes in mid-July, and remained suppressed throughout August and September Only D. mendotae was present in appreciable numbers during this period; from mid-July through the end of August, 86-98% of cladoceran biomass (exclusive of Bythotrephes and Leptodora) was contributed by D. mendotae. Densities of Leptodora and Bythotrephes showed a strikingly inverse relationship, both temporally and spatially, during 1986. Size frequency distributions of D. mendotae exhibited an immediate shift towards extremely large (> 2.5 mm) individuals coincident with Bythotrephes' appearance in 1986, suggesting an upper size limit to efficient prey utilization by Bythotrephes. These results suggest that Bythotrephes can have substantial impacts both on cladoceran community composition, and on the size distributions of individual species.																			0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					109	121		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[109:CITCCO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[109:CITCCO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400009

The sampling was carried out as the ice broke up, when, within two weeks, the water temperature rose from 3 degrees C to 13 degrees C. Large lakes to small pools of different water chemistry were investigated. The plankton collected was studied alive within a few hours after sampling. Preparations for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were made from fresh samples and later also from material preserved in Lugol's solution. About 95% of the water bodies contained chrysophytes. Species belonging to the genera Chrysosphaerella, Dinobryon, Mallonionas, Synura, Ochromonas, Paraphysomonas, Spiniferomonas, Uroglena and Uroglenopsis were recorded. The genus Uroglena was frequent and recorded in 30% of the localities studied. Mass development of different Uroglena species was found in several waterbodies. Many populations had developed stomatocysts (statospores, cysts) of different morphology, and, using LM, smooth stomatocysts and stomatocysts with long spines could be recognised. However, using SEM, it was shown that also the smooth stomatocysts had short spines. Four new species of Uroglena were found and are described here. Uroglena estonica and U. spinosa had long spines while U. kukkii and U. pikamae had very short spines. In addition, mass development of stomatocysts of an Ochromonas was recorded in two lakes. This species had similarities with Ochromonas stellaris, but differed in stomatocyst ornamentation, and is also described as a new species, O. magnifica.																			0029-5035	2363-7188					2005				128			43	63																WOS:000235193900004

However, hydropower is itself dependent on local weather conditions and climate variability. Moreover, extreme climate conditions, such as hot-dry compound events, can have a major impact on hydropower production (HP). Here, we examine the impacts of hot-dry conditions on HP under current and future climate scenarios in Switzerland, a country where hydropower provides the biggest share (60%) of the total electricity production. Overall, our results point out that the impacts of hot-dry conditions on HP are case-specific. We found that hot-dry compound conditions during the warmer months negatively impact HP in power plants with little or no water storage capacity (run-of-river schemes). On the contrary, schemes with large, seasonal accumulation lakes and significant glacier resources will continue to be able to produce high amounts of HP during hot-dry conditions in summer, which is an important result for Alpine hydropower.

Holocene fluctuations of Bregne ice cap, Scoresby Sund, east Greenland: a proxy for climate along the Greenland Ice Sheet margin	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Greenland Ice Sheet is a major component of the Arctic cryosphere and the magnitude of its response to future climate changes remains uncertain. Longer-term records of climate near the ice sheet margin provide information about natural climate variability and can be used to understand the causes of past changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet. As a proxy for Holocene climate near the ice sheet margin, we reconstruct the fluctuations of Bregne ice cap in the Scoresby Sund region of central east Greenland. Bregne is a small ice cap (2.5 km(2) in area) and responds sensitively to summer temperatures. We employ a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the ice cap fluctuations using geomorphic mapping, Be-10 ages of boulders and bedrock and lake sediment records. Past extents of Bregne ice cap are marked by moraines and registered by sediments in downvalley lakes. Be-10 ages of bedrock and boulders outboard of the moraines indicate that Bregne ice cap was within similar to 250 m of its present-day limit by at least 10.7 ka. Multi-proxy data from sediments in Two Move lake, located downvalley from Bregne ice cap, indicate that the ice cap likely completely disappeared during early and middle Holocene time. Increasing magnetic susceptibility and percent clastic material from similar to 6.5 to similar to 1.9 cal ka BP in Two Move lake sediments suggest progressively colder conditions and increased snow accumulation on the highlands west of the lake. Laminated silt deposited at similar to 2.6 cal ka BP and similar to 1.9 cal ka BP to present registers the onset and persistence of Bregne ice cap during the late Holocene. Be-10 ages of boulders on an unweathered, unvegetated moraine in the Bregne ice cap forefield range from 0.74 to 9.60 ka. The youngest Be-10 age (0.74 ka) likely represents the age of the moraine whereas older ages may be due to Be-10 inherited from prior periods of exposure. This late Holocene moraine marks the second largest advance of the ice cap since deglaciation of the region at the end of the last ice age. The oldest moraine in the forefield dates to <= 2.6 cal ka BP. The fluctuations of Bregne ice cap were likely influenced by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation throughout the Holocene and abrupt late Holocene cold events. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the sample studied, Nevskia was quite abundant and found together with a planktonic Gallionella. The apical cells of Nevskia were 0.5-0.7 .mu.m wide and 1.5-3 .mu.m long, curved rods with laterally excreted stalks and without measurable amounts of iron in the cells. The stalks were short and, in some instances, were composed of six to eight strands of fibrils. The stalks were also encrusted with iron, aluminum, and other elements. Dry matter content of the cells was 260-350 pg per cell. The organic material excreted as stalks was estimated to be 500-1200 fg per cell. The Nevskia described here is morphologically related to the genus Gallionella.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				FEB	1986	32	2					89	92		10.1139/m86-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m86-019													WOS:A1986A654800003

Before leaf fall chlorophyll breaks down more rapidly than carotenoids, while the reverse is true in soils. Pigment concentrations in the organic matter of sediments from productive lakes are usually much higher than concentrations in the litter and humus layers of woodland soils. This suggests that the contribution of woodland litter and humus to the organic matter in such sediments is outweighed by contributions from aquatic macro-phytes and phytoplankton.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1967	48	2					306	+		10.2307/1933116	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933116													WOS:A19679315900018

Using historical data we also estimated the internal phosphorus load (IPL) between 1972 and 2015. EPL reached its maximum in the mid-1980s with phosphorus (P) values similar to 21 t yr(-1) compared to the current value close to 6 t yr(-1). IPL was one order of magnitude less and ranged between 0.25 t yr(-)1 (2015) and 3.6 (1985) t yr(-1). The strong reduction of the P load determined a marked decrease of both P (from 200 to 23 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (from 18 to 8 mu g L-1) in-lake concentrations. The process of eutrophication and subsequent recovery, however, showed hysteresis between P load and in-lake P concentrations. In recent years, in particular, the P concentrations at winter overturn seem to be independent from the P load, related to modifications in the hydrological management of the lake that favored P flushout in October-November, when the EPL is maximal. This process led to a marked decrease of the total P concentrations at winter overturn (23 mu g L-1), which recently resulted in lower-than-target concentrations (30 mu g L-1) established by the Lombardy Region. The lake, nevertheless, suffers from the presence of the toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, and eradicating this species and further improving water quality will likely require an additional abatement of the EPL.

Field observations indicate that the 2743 Ma Bird River Sill was emplaced into the Northern Lamprey Falls Formation in an oceanic setting and subsequently intruded by the ca. 2725 Ma Maskwa Lake Batholith II. The Northern Lamprey Falls Formation is in fault contact with the overlying Peterson Creek Formation, which in turn is unconformably overlain by the Bird River Formation. The peridotites of the Bird River Sill were subjected to intense alteration and ductile shearing, resulting in the redistribution of many major and trace elements and resetting of their Sm-Nd and U-Th-Pb isotopic systems. The gabbro, leucogabbro, and anorthosite units of the sill largely retain their primary igneous textures and minerals, REE and HFSE compositions, and Sm- Nd and Pb isotope signatures. These geochemical and petrographic data indicate that these units of the Bird River Sill crystallised from a hydrous, Ca- and Al-rich tholeiitic magma that fractionated from a hydrous primitive arc tholeiitic parental magma. The major and trace element geochemistry and initial eNd values of the Bird River Sill (+ 0.53 to + 4.72) and the Northern Lamprey Falls Formation (+ 1.40 to + 2.66) of the Bird River greenstone belt crystallised from parental magma batches that were derived by partial melting of variably-depleted mantle sources. High-magnesian andesites from the Bird River Formation formed by partial melting of subducting oceanic crust and/or slab sediments and subsequent interaction with sub-arc mantle peridotite, whereas the Peterson Creek Formation dacites and Maskwa Lake TTG Batholith I tonalites formed by partial melting of juvenile lower arc crust. The major and trace element geochemistry of the Bird River Sill and greenstone belt and the Maskwa Lake TTG Batholith I, and geological relationships and lithological associations point to a transition from continental arc to continental back-arc magmatism along the southern active margin of the North Caribou terrane at ca. 2743 Ma, resulting in the formation of the Maskwa Lake microcontinent that occurred prior to subsequent continental arc magmatism along the southern margin of this microcontinent. Combined field observations and geochemical data indicate that the Bird River Sill and Bird River greenstone belt are a dismembered Archean subduction-related ophiolite that marks a suture zone between the Winnipeg River subprovince and the Maskwa Lake microcontinent.

Differences in habitat conditions were found between these two species. Field observations in different habitats indicated that P. antennarius prefers shallow inland lakes and springs with limnic water, whereas A. desmaresti prefers rivers with brackish water. However, both species are known to be tolerant to medium salinity oscillations: P. antennarius was found to inhabit limnic and oligohaline water (0-5%), while A. desmaresti was found in habitats with larger salinity oscillations, occurring in mesohaline water (5-9%). Only the presence of A. desmaresti was observed during increased marine influence due to low seasonal freshwater inflow in the dry period (October).

A sediment core collected from Taal Lake in the central Philippines was analyzed for I-129 and I-127 to investigate this influence in a low-latitude terrestrial system. A baseline of 1291/1271 atomic ratios was established at (2.04-5.14) x 10(-12) in the pre-nuclear era in this region. Controlled by the northeasterly equatorial trade winds, increased I-129/I-127 ratios of (20.1-69.3) x 10(-12) suggest that atmospheric nuclear weapons tests at the Pacific Proving Grounds in the central Pacific Ocean was the major source of I-129 in the sediment during 1956-1962. The I-129/I-127 ratios, up to 157.5 x 10(-12) after 1964, indicate a strong influence by European nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. The East Asian Winter Monsoon is found to be the dominant driving force in the atmospheric,dispersion of radioactive iodine (I-129) from the European nuclear fuel reprocessing plants to Southeast Asia, which is also important for dispersion of other airborne pollutants from the middle-high to low latitude regions. A significant I-129/I-127, peak at 42.8 cm in the Taal Lake core appears to be the signal of the Chernobyl accident in 1986. In addition, volcanic activities are reflected in the iodine isotope profiles in the sediment core, suggesting the potential of using iodine isotopes as an indicator of volcanic eruptions.

The three epibionts were most common from midspring to early summer. Colacium calvum and S. cyclopum preferred Daphnia as a host over all other taxa and C vesiculosum preferred cyclopoids followed by Daphnia. The prevalence of all three epibionts was directly correlated to the density of Daphnia, and no zooplankton were observed with these epibionts when Daphnia was absent from the zooplankton community. Predation on Daphnia by age-0 fish indirectly limited the seasonal presence of both Colacium spp. Synedra cyclopum was abundant in years when water transparency and Daphnia pulex abundance were highest, and rare in years when transparency was low and Daphnia galeata was the most abundant Daphnia.

Distinctive sandy deposits were formed as a result of the water-level fall. These deposits form a marker horizon at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, which has been used as the 0-varve in Finnish clay varve chronology. These sandy deposits have not been dated, and in general, there is lack of direct age determinations from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Sediments from three localities: backshore, beachface and upper shoreface environments, interpreted to be connected with BIL drainage, were sampled and dated with an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) method. Only the beachface deposit appeared to be the suitable material, giving the expected dates of 11 400 +/- 1100 and 11 200 +/- 1300 years BP for the water-level fall. The other samples were interpreted as only partially bleached, or they represented a mixture of different age generations. This is the first direct dating of a Yoldia shore deposit in Finland and provides a reference for shore displacement studies in Finland. The results also verify the potential of the OSL method in dating ancient shorelines or land uplift history.

In such regions, several studies have demonstrated that annual growth rings of dwarf shrubs are suitable proxies for palaeoclimatic investigations. In High Asia, the pioneer work of Liang et al. (Liang E, Lu X, Ren P, Li X, Zhu L, Eckstein D, 2012. Annual increments of juniper dwarf shrubs above the tree line on the central Tibetan Plateau: a useful climatic proxy. Annals of Botany 109: 721-728) confirmed the suitability of shrub growth-ring chronologies for palaeoclimatic research. This study presents the first sensitivity study of an annually resolved delta O-18 time series inferred from Wilson juniper (Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii) from the northern shoreline of lake Nam Co (Tibetan Plateau). Methods Based on five individual dwarf shrub discs, a statistically reliable delta O-18 chronology covering the period 1957-2009 was achieved (expressed population signal = 0.80). Spearman's correlation analysis between the delta O-18 chronology and climate variables from different sources was applied. In a first step, the suitability of various climate data was evaluated. Key Results Examinations of climate-proxy relationships revealed significant negative correlations between the delta O-18 shrub chronology and summer season moisture variability of the previous and current year. In particular, relative humidity of the previous and current vegetation period significantly determined the proxy variability (rho = -0.48, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the delta O-18 variability of the developed shrub chronology significantly coincided with a nearby tree-ring delta O-18 chronology of the same genus (r = 0.62, P < 0.01). Conclusions The delta O-18 shrub chronology reliably recorded humidity variations in the Nam Co region. The chronology was significantly correlated with a nearby moisture-sensitive tree-ring delta O-18 chronology, indicating a common climate signal in the two chronologies. This climate signal was likely determined by moisture variations of the Asian summer monsoon. Local climate effects were superimposed on the supra-regional climate signature of the monsoon circulation. Opposing delta O-18 values between the two chronologies were interpreted as plant-physiological differences during isotopic fractionation processes.

DESTRUCTION SCENARIOS FOR SEISMOGENIC, GLACIAL AND ANY OTHER NATURAL DAMS IN MOUNTAIN VALLEYS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The structural types and destruction scenarios of natural dams, which differ by their genesis, are examined using the Google Earth and SASPlanet data and the author's field study results. As it is established, landslide and rock fall dams of seismic origins serve as the barriers for Sarezskoye and Yashilkul Lakes in the Pamirs, Ritsa and Kazenoyam Lakes in the Caucasus, Kucherlinskoye Lake in Altai, and Goluboye Lake in the northern Priokhotye. Typical rock falls consist of boulders and rubble rocks and have a high filtering capacity, and, as a result, they are subject to a rapid wash-out by the locked water flow, which process is associated with formation of suffusion scour channel followed by suffusion-erosion canyon, like in the Chul R. valley (the tributary of the Tumany River, the Sea of Okhotsk coasts). Natural dams of tectonic origins developed as a result of faulting processes in valleys and displacements of crustal blocks having size of about several kilometers. The examples are Amtkel Lake in the Caucasus, and Darpir, Takalyr and pra-Nuke Lakes in the Russian North-East, which display their maximum resistance to river-caused erosion processes. However, they often become destroyed due to newly-formed faults, as it is exemplified by the terminated destruction of the Khurendya R. valley dam and the still continuing wash-out of Darpir and Amtkel Lakes dams. Talus cones have their radial size up to several tens of kilometers and consist of sand, gravel and pebble rocks. They can be easily cut through over their distal areas having the minimum sediment thickness. The examples of the partial dam barriers are Darpir, Maly Darpir, Solnechnoye and Elikchanskiye Lakes in the North-East of Russia, Baikalyonok Lake in the northwestern Priokhotye, and Tere-Khol' Lake in Tyva. Many large lakes are dam-locked by end moraines and their complexes, which can be from several kilometers to tens of kilometers in size, and are the remnants of mountain valley glaciation. The examples are Maggiore, Komo and Garda Lakes in the Italian Alps; Keta, Lama and Khantayskoye Lakes over Putorana Plateau; Labynkyr, Tabanda, Jack London, Malyk, Momontay, Ui and Koolen Lakes in the North-East of Russia; Azas, Many-Khol', Noyan-Khol' Lakes in Tyva. A slow wash-out of wide, gently sloping and water-resistant end moraines occurs due to locked water overflow, and depends on the opening size and the lake influx. Active glacial dams are subject to the most intense destruction. Merzbacher Lake in the Tien-Shan consists of two parts separated by an ice dam and has a length of about 2.6 km. Twice a year, during 2-7 days, all lake water from the lower part is discharged into the Inylchek R. valley, the discharge rate about 1 000 m(3)/sec. Miles and Van Cleve Lakes in Alaska appear to have the same dynamic dam destruction scenarios. Natural dams are classified by their destruction-resistance capacity as follows: glacial dams, talus cones, rock falls, seismotectonic and moraine dams.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				MAY	2015		394					230	238		10.17223/15617793/394/37	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/15617793/394/37													WOS:000421015400037

W.; Huang, Jinlong; Pinskwar, I.; Su, Buda; Szwed, M.; Jiang, Tong			Climate variability and floods in China - A review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is a strong inter-annual and inter-decadal variability in time series of variables related to water abundance, such as intense precipitation, high river discharge, flood magnitude, and flood loss in China. Part of this variability can be random or chaotic, but it may well be that climate variability track plays an important role in the interpretation of the variability of water abundance. The principal aim of this review paper is to create a summary of literature-based information on links of various climate-variability drivers, i.e. natural oscillations in the ocean-atmosphere system, and the variability of characteristics of destructive water abundance in China, at a range of spatial scales (national, provincial, basin-based, municipal). The present paper reviews extensive pool of literature discussing the links between the two modes of oscillation in the ocean-atmosphere system (ENSO - El Nino-Southern Oscillation and PDO - Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and variability in time series of variables related to water abundance in China. This paper also reviews examples of extension of the database, with the help of proxies. It reviews interpretation of possible link of particular large flood events (e.g. the 1998 and the 2016 deluges) to climate variability. Also a range of issues of relevance to water management are reviewed, such as seasonal forecasting and non-stationarity of flood frequency.

PRESENT STATUS OF ZOOPLANKTONAND BENTHIC INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN DANUBE DELTA SHALLOW LAKES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												This paper presents a study on the zooplankton and benthic invertebrate community in shallow lakes from Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve. Samples have been collected three times in each season except winter in 2014. At each lake zooplankton was collected with plankton net from 5 stations and benthic invertebrates with an Ekmann dredge from three stations. Additionally, environmental factors (temperature, transparency, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were measured. A variety of metrics (e.g. diversity, evenness) were calculated and used to provide an image of the status of analysed community structure in investigated aquatic ecosystems.

RIT also made ground-based measurements of lake water and ice temperatures, ice thickness and atmospheric variables. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) used the data collected by RIT and a 3-D hydrodynamic code to simulate the Midland cooling lake. The hydrodynamic code was able to reproduce the time distribution of ice coverage on the lake during the entire winter. The simulations and data show that the amount of ice coverage is almost linearly proportional to the rate at which heat is injected into the lake (Q). Very rapid melting of ice occurs when strong winds accelerate the movement of warm water underneath the ice. A snow layer on top of the ice acts as an insulator and decreases the rate of heat loss from the water below the ice to the atmosphere above. The simulated ice cover on the lake was not highly sensitive to the thickness of the snow layer. The simplicity of the relationship between ice cover and Q and the weak responses of ice cover to snow depth over the ice are probably attributable to the negative feedback loop that exists between ice cover and heat loss to the atmosphere.					; Salvaggio, Carl/GZH-0043-2022	Salvaggio, Carl/0000-0001-9293-9696; Garrett, Alfred/0000-0003-4649-6446; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-8125-2				2010	7661								766105	10.1117/12.849349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.849349													WOS:000285625700003

India's major river system, the Ganges system is located here, which supplies water to the large population of the downstream areas. It has high potential to generate hydroelectricity and construction of irrigation projects. Surface water in the forms of natural springs, lakes and ponds has depleted largely during the recent past, because of warming and climate change. Similarly, ground water is receding due to excessive use, the study reveals.																			1574-0919		978-3-030-14180-6; 978-3-030-14179-0				2020	66						47	61		10.1007/978-3-030-14180-6_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14180-6_4	10.1007/978-3-030-14180-6												WOS:000486253300006

Long-Term Citizen-Collected Data Reveal Geographical Patterns and Temporal Trends in Lake Water Clarity	PLOS ONE												We compiled a lake-water clarity database using publically available, citizen volunteer observations made between 1938 and 2012 across eight states in the Upper Midwest, USA. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether temporal trends in lake-water clarity existed across this large geographic area and (2) whether trends were related to the lake-specific characteristics of latitude, lake size, or time period the lake was monitored. Our database consisted of >140,000 individual Secchi observations from 3,251 lakes that we summarized per lake-year, resulting in 21,020 summer averages. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found approximately a 1% per year increase in water clarity (quantified as Secchi depth) for the entire population of lakes. On an individual lake basis, 7% of lakes showed increased water clarity and 4% showed decreased clarity. Trend direction and strength were related to latitude and median sample date. Lakes in the southern part of our study-region had lower average annual summer water clarity, more negative long-term trends, and greater inter-annual variability in water clarity compared to northern lakes. Increasing trends were strongest for lakes with median sample dates earlier in the period of record (1938-2012). Our ability to identify specific mechanisms for these trends is currently hampered by the lack of a large, multi-thematic database of variables that drive water clarity (e. g., climate, land use/cover). Our results demonstrate, however, that citizen science can provide the critical monitoring data needed to address environmental questions at large spatial and long temporal scales. Collaborations among citizens, research scientists, and government agencies may be important for developing the data sources and analytical tools necessary to move toward an understanding of the factors influencing macro-scale patterns such as those shown here for lake water clarity.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Wagner, Tyler/MIU-0726-2025	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Downing, John/0000-0001-8547-0789; Webster, Katherine/0000-0002-6009-0146; 													1932-6203					APR 30	2014	9	4							e95769	10.1371/journal.pone.0095769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095769								24788722					WOS:000338917300018
J	Bergström, AK; Jansson, M; Drakare, S; Blomqvist, P				Bergström, AK; Jansson, M; Drakare, S; Blomqvist, P			Occurrence of mixotrophic flagellates in relation to bacterioplankton production, light regime and availability of inorganic nutrients in unproductive lakes with differing humic contents	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Field data from five unproductive Swedish lakes were used to investigate the occurrence of mixotrophic flagellates in relation to bacterioplankton, autotrophic phytoplankton, heterotrophic flagellates and abiotic environmental factors. Three different sources of data were used: (i) a 3-year study (1995-97) of the humic Lake Ortrasket, (ii) seasonal measurements from five lakes with widely varying dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and (iii) whole lake enrichment experiments with inorganic nutrients and organic carbon. 2. Mixotrophic flagellates usually dominated over autotrophic phytoplankton in Lake Ortrasket in early summer, when both bacterial production and light levels were high. Comparative data from the five lakes demonstrated that the ratio between the biomasses of mixotrophic flagellates and autotrophic phytoplankton (the M/A-ratio) was positively correlated to bacterioplankton production, but not to the light regime. Whole lake carbon addition (white sugar) increased bacterial biomass, and production, reduced the biomass of autotrophs by a factor of 16, and increased the M/A-ratio from 0.03 to 3.4. Collectively, the results indicate that the dominance of mixotrophs among phytoplankton was positively related to bacterioplankton production. 3. Whole lake fertilisation with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) demonstrated that the obligate autotrophic phytoplankton was limited by N. N-addition increased the biomass of the autotrophic phytoplankton but had no effect on mixotrophic flagellates or bacteria, and the M/A-ratio decreased from 1.2 to 0.6 after N-enrichment. Therefore, we suggest that bacteria under natural conditions, by utilising allochthonous DOC as an energy and carbon source, are able to outcompete autotrophs for available inorganic nutrients. Consequently, mixotrophic flagellates can become the dominant phytoplankters when phagotrophy permits them to use nutrients stored in bacterial biomass. 4. In Lake Ortrasket, the biomass of mixotrophs was usually higher than the biomass of heterotrophs during the summer. This dominance could not be explained by higher grazing rates among the mixotrophs. Instead, ratios between mixotrophic and heterotrophic biomass (the M/H-ratio) were positively related to light availability. Therefore, we suggest that photosynthesis can enable mixotrophic flagellates to outcompete heterotrophic flagellates.

Comparative Genomics and Physiological Investigation of a New Arthrospira/Limnospira Strain O9.13F Isolated from an Alkaline, Winter Freezing, Siberian Lake	CELLS												Cyanobacteria from the genus Arthrospira/Limnospira are considered haloalkalotolerant organisms with optimal growth temperatures around 35 degrees C. They are most abundant in soda lakes in tropical and subtropical regions. Here, we report the comprehensive genome-based characterisation and physiological investigation of the new strain O9.13F that was isolated in a temperate climate zone from the winter freezing Solenoye Lake in Western Siberia. Based on genomic analyses, the Siberian strain belongs to the Arthrospira/Limnospira genus. The described strain O9.13F showed the highest relative growth index upon cultivation at 20 degrees C, lower than the temperature 35 degrees C reported as optimal for the Arthrospira/Limnospira strains. We assessed the composition of fatty acids, proteins and photosynthetic pigments in the biomass of strain O9.13F grown at different temperatures, showing its potential suitability for cultivation in a temperate climate zone. We observed a decrease of gamma-linolenic acid favouring palmitic acid in the case of strain O9.13F compared to tropical strains. Comparative genomics showed no unique genes had been found for the Siberian strain related to its tolerance to low temperatures. In addition, this strain does not possess a different set of genes associated with the salinity stress response from those typically found in tropical strains. We confirmed the absence of plasmids and functional prophage sequences. The genome consists of a 4.94 Mbp with a GC% of 44.47% and 5355 encoded proteins. The Arthrospira/Limnospira strain O9.13F presented in this work is the first representative of a new clade III based on the 16S rRNA gene, for which a genomic sequence is available in public databases (PKGD00000000).

The first experiment was conducted at the onset of winter, exposing small (50 to 85 mm) and large (85 to 129 mm) fish to a decline in water temperature from 12 to 2 degrees C at a rate of 1 degrees C/hr. During this experiment, both large and small individuals exposed to a rapid cooling event experienced no mortality or abnormal behaviors. Separate fish were then maintained under thermal and photoperiod regimes that mimicked those in Lake Superior from October through May. Fish in each size class were maintained at two feeding treatments: Artemia ad libitum and no food. At the completion of the winter period, these lake herring were subjected to the same rapid cooling event conducted in the first experiment. During the experiment, lake herring exhibited no mortality or abnormal behaviors despite treatment-dependent differences in condition and lipid content. Our results indicate that mortality due to rapid cooling events does not appear to contribute to the recruitment variability observed for juvenile lake herring in Lake Superior.

The dominating contaminating elements were Be, Ag, Cd, Pb and As. The high concentration and EF values showed that the anthropogenic pollutants in atmospheric aerosol from the West, Central Asia and South Asia could be carried to the Tibetan Plateau under the influence of southwest monsoon. The obvious increase of concentration of As from 4.5 cm layer of sediment core represented the increase of As in aerosols, and reflected the continuous development of manufacturing and living and the dramatic deterioration of atmospheric environment of the West, Central Asia and South Asia regions since the 1940s.

However, the bacterial community function and co-occurrence models of lakes have not been studied in depth. In this study, we observed significant seasonal changes and non-significant spatial changes in the beta diversity and community structure of sediment bacteria in Lake Chaohu. Through linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), we observed that certain taxa (from phylum to genus) have consistent enrichment between seasons. The sudden appearance of a Firmicutes population in spring samples from the Zhaohe River, an estuary of Lake Chaohu, and the dominance of Firmicutes populations in other regions suggested that exogenous pollution and environmental induction strongly impacted the assembly of bacterial communities in the sediments. Several taxa that serve as intermediate centers in Co-occurrence network analysis (i.e., Pedosphaeraceae, Phycisphaeraceae, Anaerolineaceae, and Geobacteraceae) may play an important role in sediments. Furthermore, compared with previous studies of plants and animals, the results of our study suggest that various organisms, including microorganisms, are resistant to environmental changes and/or exogenous invasions, allowing them to maintain their community structure.

One-Year Retention of Passive Integrated Transponders in Adult Muskellunge, and Applications to Broodstock Management	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy are long-lived fish that typically occur at low densities. Tracking the history of individuals used as broodstock allows accurate determination of the effective population size and is essential to meeting genetic objectives for management-oriented hatchery propagation programs. We tested the utility of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for tracking individual muskellunge. We placed PIT tags in the cheeks of 291 adult muskellunge netted during the spring spawning season in two Wisconsin lakes. Partial Cut clips were used as a secondary mark. The lakes were sampled during the following year. and 73 fish with fin clips were recovered in a sample of 271 fish. The one year tag retention rate was 90.4% in the two lakes. Six fish without functional tags were examined for the presence of broken or malfunctioning tags. and all were missing tags. The use of PIT tags is feasible for adult muskellunge and is useful for maintaining individually based broodstock records.																			1522-2055					OCT	2009	71	4					330	332		10.1577/A09-004.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/A09-004.1													WOS:000272025100008

Among the three lake regions, the concentration of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and As fell in the order of South Dongting Lake (SD) > East Dongting Lake (ED) > West Dongting Lake (WD), whereas the concentration of Hg fell in the order of WD > SD > ED. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, and As were 1.69-2.02 times the background values recorded in 1986, whereas the concentrations of Cd and Hg were 8.97 and 5.32 times the background values, respectively. The ecological risk was low for Cu, Zn, Pb, As but high for Hg and Cd. For Dongting Lake in aggregate, the heavy metals caused considerable ecological risk and high biotoxicity, although the situation was improving in recent years. Cd, As, Cu, Pb, Hg were mainly from agricultural sources, mining sources, tire wear and agricultural sources, industrial smelting and mining sources, industrial processing and smelting sources, respectively, and Zn was from mixed sources. A total of 66 species of benthic macroinvertebrates were identified from the sediments. From 2018 to 2022, the dominant benthic macro- invertebrates gradually shifted from the pollution-resistant in Tubificidae to those in Gammarus, Bellamya, Valvatidae, etc. Oligochaetes and Stictochironomus spp. exhibited extremely high response to heavy metals and could serve as indicator organisms of heavy metal pollution.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC	2024	209		A						117181	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117181		OCT 2024						39454397					WOS:001344631500001

Though sampling effort has varied over the dataset range, the size of the dataset is unprecedented within the field of amphibian ecology. With more than 2,480 individual species sampling dates and more than 151,701 recorded individual occurrences of the nine amphibian species, the described dataset represents the longest and largest time-series of herpetological sampling with paired water quality data. New information We describe the novel publication of a paired dataset of amphibian occurrence with environmental indicators spanning nearly 90 years of data collection. As of February 2020, the dataset includes 2,480 sampling dates across eleven vernal pools and 151,701 unique occurrences of egg masses or individuals recorded across nine species of amphibian. The dataset also includes environmental conditions associated with the species occurrences with complete coverage for air temperature and precipitation records and partial coverage for a variety of other weather and water quality measures. Data collection has included species, egg mass and tadpole counts; weather conditions including precipitation, sky and wind codes; water quality measurements including water temperature and pH; and vernal pool assessment including depth and surface vegetation coverage. Collection of data was sporadic from 1931-1991, but data have been collected consistently from 1991 to present. We also began monitoring dissolved oxygen, nitrate concentrations and conductivity of the vernal pools using a YSI Sonde Professional Plus Instrument and turbidity using a turbidity tube in February 2018.

J	Janik, CJ; McLaren, MK				Janik, Cathy J.; McLaren, Marcia K.			Seismicity and fluid geochemistry at Lassen Volcanic National Park, California: Evidence for two circulation cells in the hydrothermal system	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Seismic analysis and geochemical interpretations provide evidence that two separate hydrothermal cells circulate within the greater Lassen hydrothermal system. One cell originates south to SW of Lassen Peak and within the Brokeoff Volcano depression where it forms a reservoir of hot fluid (235-270 degrees C) that boils to feed steam to the high-temperature fumarolic areas, and has a plume of degassed reservoir liquid that flows southward to emerge at Growler and Morgan Hot Springs. The second cell originates SSE to SE of Lassen Peak and flows southeastward along inferred faults of the Walker Lane belt (WLB) where it forms a reservoir of hot fluid (220-240 degrees C) that boils beneath Devils Kitchen and Boiling Springs Lake, and has an outflow plume of degassed liquid that boils again beneath Terminal Geyser. Three distinct seismogenic zones (identified as the West, Middle, and East seismic clusters) occur at shallow depths (<6 km) in Lassen Volcanic National Park, SW to SSE of Lassen Peak and adjacent to areas of high-temperature (<= 161 degrees C) furnarolic activity (Sulphur Works, Pilot Pinnacle, Little Hot Springs Valley, and Bumpass Hell) and an area of cold, weak gas emissions (Cold Boiling Lake). The three zones are located within the inferred Rockland caldera in response to interactions between deeply circulating meteoric water and hot brittle rock that overlies residual magma associated with the Lassen Volcanic Center. Earthquake focal mechanisms and stress inversions indicate primarily N-S oriented normal faulting and E-W extension, with some oblique faulting and right lateral shear in the East cluster. The different focal mechanisms as well as spatial and temporal earthquake patterns for the East cluster indicate a greater influence by regional tectonics and inferred faults within the WLB. A fourth, deeper (5-10 km) seismogenic zone (the Devils Kitchen seismic cluster) occurs SE of the East cluster and trends NNW from Sifford Mountain toward the Devils Kitchen thermal area where fumarolic temperatures are <= 123 degrees C. Lassen furnaroles discharge geothermal gases that indicate mixing between a N-2-rich, arc-type component and gases derived from air-saturated meteoric recharge water. Most gases have relatively weak isotopic indicators of upper mantle or volcanic components, except for gas from Sulphur Works where delta C-13-CO2, delta S-34-H2S, and delta N-15-N-2 values indicate a contribution from the mantle and a subducted sediment source in an arc volcanic setting.

Both lakes are approximately 3 ha, but the East Glacier catchment (29 ha) is about half the size of West Glacier. Bedrock is primarily quartzite that has been heavily fractured and crossed with mafic intrusions. Precipitation pH averages about 5.4-5.5, and weighted mean acid neutralizing capacities (ANC) of the discharge are about 50 mu equiv. l(-1) for East Glacier lake and 39 mu equiv.l(-1) for West Glacier, while the respective annual base cation removals are about 36 mequiv. m(-2) and 73 mequiv.m(-2). Two West Glacier tributary streams average less than 10 mu equiv.l(-1) ANC, but solute concentrations during the early snow melt are more than five times those found in midsummer. It is inferred that these early high concentrations primarily are due to early elution of solutes from the snowpack rather than the displacement of high-concentration groundwater, but the cations may be substantially affected by exchange reactions. Preliminary evaluation suggests that the mean ANC of both lakes would fall below zero if precipitation pH were to fall to 4.2-4.3. Episodic acidity during snowmelt and acidification of tributary streams would likely occur at a somewhat higher precipitation pH.																			0022-1694					DEC	1995	173	1-4					165	189		10.1016/0022-1694(95)02701-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(95)02701-P													WOS:A1995TG71300010

However, significant contraries on Holocene paleoclimate evolution are still exist. To better understand the climate history on the northeastern TP particularly its variability, we here investigated the stable carbon isotope compositions of Black Carbon (BC) (delta C-13(BC)) in Lake Gyaring sediment core from the source area of the Yellow River. The delta C-13(BC) values were relatively positive before similar to 6.2 cal kyr BP indicating that the climate on northeastern TP was warm and dry during the first half of the Holocene, while the decreasing trend thereafter reflects that the climate on the northeastern TP has become generally cooler and wetter since the middle Holocene. Superimposed on the long-term paleoclimate evolution pattern, at least seven centennial-scale cold-wet events characterized by significant delta C-13(BC) depletions occurred at about 8.4, 7.5, 6.2, 5.0, 4.3, 2.7, and 0.9 cal kyr BP. Those abrupt climate events well corresponded to the weak Asian Monsoon episodes and the ice-rafted debris records in the North Atlantic. We speculate that the cold climate signals from the North Atlantic resulted from the sea-ice expansion have been transported to the northeastern TP through the westerlies leading to a cold conditions there. Besides, the anomalous easterly water vapor transportation over the northern periphery of the TP during weak monsoon intervals has generated the wet conditions on the northeastern TP.

Despite this, the long-term patterns of waterbird abundance and the state of the wetlands themselves had not been analyzed. Changes in abundance and distribution of 3.4 million birds belonging to 19 waterbird taxa that winter in the Mexican Highlands were assessed using data from the United States Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) aerial surveys carried out between 1951 and 2006. Additionally, water occurrence at 29 wetlands used by these birds was inferred from satellite imagery corresponding to the bird count dates by calculating water surface area using Google Earth Engine. Bird abundance between 1975 and 2006 and environmental variables were modelled using Generalized Linear Mixed Models to identify determinants of wetland use by these groups of wintering waterbirds. Total sampled abundance in the Highlands was between 125,000 and 500,000 individuals of the different species of waterbird per year, and their abundance was highly variable between sites and years. The sites with the highest average abundance were Laguna de Babicora and the wetland complexes from Laguna Bustillos to Laguna de los Mexicanos in the northwestern section of the Highlands, as well as the wetlands in the sierra of the state of Durango, to the south-southeast of the former. Water permanence was different between the six subregions into which the wetlands were grouped, despite waterbody size not being significantly different between them. Overall, waterbirds were more abundant in semi-permanent sites, and abundance was explained best by water surface area plus total precipitation of the previous 12 months. Geese in the area exhibited site fidelity and this reflected in site-specific variables included in the best model. Abundance of diving ducks was explained best by water surface area, while that of dabbling ducks was so by water permanence plus water surface area. Our work supports that most birds preferred reliable, natural wetlands over human-modified ones even if the latter were larger, and this has clear implications for habitat management in this semiarid region.					; Hinojosa, Alejandro/N-4017-2019; Hinojosa, Alejandro/L-5422-2015	Sigala Meza, Eric/0000-0001-6223-250X; Hinojosa, Alejandro/0000-0002-2282-337X													0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2022	30	6					1153	1165		10.1007/s11273-022-09873-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09873-5		MAR 2022											WOS:000778016600001
J	Redding, A				Redding, Art			'A Floating Population': The Niagara Corridor and Canadian/American Radicalism in the Nineteenth Century	COMPARATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES												In both Canada and the US, Niagara Falls was famous from early on as a tourist and honeymoon destination. With the rapid settlement of the 'northwest' occasioned by the building of canals and railroads, the region also became a centre of commerce, transit, and industry in the years before the Civil War. The Niagara corridor held an important position on the Underground Railroad, as fugitive slaves moved up into Canada (and back). After the failed uprising of 1837, Canadian revolutionaries fled to safety in Rochester, Buffalo, and other cities south of the border. The 'burnt over' region of western New York spawned a variety of radical utopian communities and the first Women's Rights convention was held in Seneca Falls in 1848. Drawing on a variety of texts, testimonials, and documents, and taking a transnational approach, 'A Floating Population' contends that the Niagara region was a matrix of political radicalism as flows and exchanges of people, capital, and radical ideas through and across the border contributed to an unprecedented ferment of utopian, progressive, and radical forms of thought and social experimentation. The essay considers the uniquely radical republican culture situated in the border region of the Niagara corridor, a crossroads traversed by all manner of militant insurrectionists, radicals, abolitionists, feminists, journalists, fugitives, immigrants, homesteaders, itinerant labourers and tramps, Native Americans, mystics, and tourists.																			1477-5700	1741-2676				JUN	2015	13	1-2					74	90		10.1179/1477570015Z.000000000100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1477570015Z.000000000100													WOS:000363901100006

The fast developing agriculture and urbanization in Hai He basin have resulted in discharging nutrient-rich wastewater into lakes and reservoirs, leading to eutrophication and water scarcity such as in Guanting reservoir and Baiyangdian lake. In this study we analyzed future trends in nutrient inputs into Guanting reservoir and Baiyangdian lake by applying the MARINA (Model to Assess River Inputs of Nutrients to seAs) model. We analyzed trends between 2012 and 2050 for a business-as-usual scenario (SSP3) and a scenario based on Current Environmental Policies (CEP). In addition, we assessed future impacts of two important events on river export of nutrients: the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in the Guanting basin (OLY scenario), and the development of Xiong'an in the Baiyangdian basin (URB scenario). Finally, we assumed implementation of advanced technologies to reduce nutrients in rivers (OLY + and URB +). Our study has five main findings. First, nutrients in Guanting reservoir and Baiyangdian lake were mainly from agriculture in 2012. Second, nutrient export doubles between 2012 and 2050 in SSP3. Third, effective implementation of current environmental policies could reduce the future pollution to levels below that in 2012. Fourth, improved sewage systems associated with the 2022 Winter Olympic Games could not reduce nutrient pollution effectively in Guanting reservoir, indicating that reducing nutrient losses from agriculture may be more effective to improve water quality than urban waste water treatment. Fifth, urbanization in the Baiyangdian basin may increase river export of nutrients to the lake by 28-43% compared to the CEP scenario (URB scenario). Highly effective waste treatment is needed not only in Xiong'an but also in surrounding areas to ensure the availability of clean water (URB + scenario). Our results could improve our understanding of nutrient management for specific lakes and reservoirs, and highly relevant for policy making for effective environmental policies.

Nonmagnetotactic Multicellular Prokaryotes from Low-Saline, Nonmarine Aquatic Environments and Their Unusual Negative Phototactic Behavior	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Magnetotactic multicellular prokaryotes (MMPs) are unique magnetotactic bacteria of the Deltaproteobacteria class and the first found to biomineralize the magnetic mineral greigite (Fe3S4). Thus far they have been reported only from marine habitats. We questioned whether MMPs exist in low-saline, nonmarine environments. MMPs were observed in samples from shallow springs in the Great Boiling Springs geothermal field and Pyramid Lake, both located in northwestern Nevada. The temperature at all sites was ambient, and salinities ranged from 5 to 11 ppt. These MMPs were not magnetotactic and did not contain magnetosomes (called nMMPs here). nMMPs ranged from 7 to 11 mu m in diameter, were composed of about 40 to 60 Gram-negative cells, and were motile by numerous flagella that covered each cell on one side, characteristics similar to those of MMPs. 16S rRNA gene sequences of nMMPs show that they form a separate phylogenetic branch within the MMP group in the Deltaproteobacteria class, probably representing a single species. nMMPs exhibited a negative phototactic behavior to white light and to wavelengths of <= 480 nm (blue). We devised a "light racetrack" to exploit this behavior, which was used to photoconcentrate nMMPs for specific purposes (e. g., DNA extraction) even though their numbers were low in the sample. Our results show that the unique morphology of the MMP is not restricted to marine and magnetotactic prokaryotes. Discovery of nonmagnetotactic forms of the MMP might support the hypothesis that acquisition of the magnetosome genes involves horizontal gene transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phototaxis in bacteria of the Deltaproteobacteria class.

Eleven species visited the lake in 2010 and their total number was 1,139. Moreover, the number of species observed in 2011 was 34 with population of 18,606 birds in total. The species observed both in 2010 and 2011 were Greater Flamingo, Black-winged Stilt, Gadwall, Mallard, Northern Pintail, Common Coot, Kentish Plover, Indian Courser, Great Bittern and Little Bittern which constituted about 29% of the total number of species present at the lake. The relative abundance was calculated for each species. Common Coot was the most abundant species in both years. The total area of lake was estimated to be 850 ha in 2010 and 943 ha in 2011. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index was also calculated. In year 2010, the diversity index was 1.47 while for year 2011 it was 1.88. In surface water analysis, Cu+2, Cd+2, Co+2, Fe+2, Mn+2, Pb+2, Zn+2, Mg+2, total hardness, Cl- and SO-4 were found to be above the permissible limits. Parameters like EC, pH, temperature, transparency were also calculated. All parameters had varied values in different months of the year.

Isolation and transgression sequences from six lakes and two tidal basins have been identified using stratigraphical analyses, magnetic susceptibility, XRF and macrofossil analyses. Macrofossils and bulk sediments have been dated by AMS radiocarbon dating. Maximum and minimum altitudes for relative sea level are provided from two deglaciation and marine lagoon sequences. Initially, relative sea level fell rapidly and reached present-day level at similar to 9000 cal. yr BP and continued falling until at least 8800 cal. yr BP. Between 8000 and 6000 cal. yr BP, sea level reached its lowest level of around 6-8 m below highest astronomical tide (h.a.t.). At around 3750 cal. yr BP, sea level has reached above 2.7 m below h.a.t. and continued to rise slowly, reaching the present-day level between similar to 2000 cal. yr BP and the present. As in the Nanortalik area further south, initial isostatic rebound caused rapid isolation of low elevation basins in the Qaqortoq area. Distinct isolation contacts in the sediments are observed. The late Holocene transgression is less well defined and occurred over a longer time interval. The late Holocene sea-level rise implies reloading by advancing glaciers superimposed on the isostatic signal from the North American Ice Sheet. One consequence of this transgression is that settlements of Palaeo-Eskimo cultures from similar to 4000 cal. yr BP may have been transgressed by the sea.

J	Parascandola, M				Parascandola, Mark			Smokeless tobacco Olympics: the US Tobacco Company, the IOC and the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic Winter Games	TOBACCO CONTROL												Throughout much of the 20(th) century, cigarette manufacturers have sponsored sporting events and used sports figures in advertising and marketing their products. The United States Tobacco Company (UST) became a sponsor of the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York, allowing the company to place the Olympic emblem on their television and print advertisements and on product packages. This paper reviews the history of UST's 1980 Olympic sponsorship using records from the IOC, the Lake Placid organising committee and internal tobacco industry documents. At the time, UST was seeking to expand the market for smokeless tobacco products, experimenting with new products and portraying their products as an alternative to smoking. At the same time, commercial sponsorship was becoming increasingly important to the future of the Games. At the time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was struggling to implement a policy prohibiting tobacco sponsorship of the Olympic Games. This episode was to be the last time a tobacco company was named an official sponsor of the Olympic Games. However, while subsequent editions of the Olympic Games have adopted policies restricting tobacco industry sponsorship, the reach of these policies is limited across any Olympic organisations. The lack of a comprehensive policy on tobacco advertising and sponsorship associated with the Olympics continues to pose a challenge to efforts to remove tobacco from the Games.

While stalagmite oxygen isotope records suggest a temporal link between the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon during the last glacial period, the patterns of monsoonal precipitation changes remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ geochemical and lithologic proxies, including Fe/Mn ratio, grain-size end members, and calcium carbonate content, to reconstruct monsoonal precipitation changes over the past 28.6 thousand years based on a continuous sediment core from Mang Co Lake, located on the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Our reconstruction identifies wet intervals of 26-23, 20-18.5, 17.5-16, and 14-0 Cal ka BP, and dry intervals of 28.6-26, 23-20, 18.5-17.5, and 16-14 Cal ka BP. The millennial-scale wet intervals in the Yangtze River basin, including the Mang Co region, during the last glacial period are associated with southward displacements of the westerly jet. We also find an inverse relationship between precipitation in the Mang Co region and tropical rainfall, observable on both interannual and millennial timescales. Instrumental observations from recent decades reveal a negative correlation between annual mean precipitation in the Yangtze River basin and tropical Asia. Additionally, wet intervals in the Mang Co record align with intensifications of the Indonesian-Australian monsoon, suggesting southward displacements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We infer that the inverse correlation between subtropical and tropical precipitation variability is due to the concurrent meridional displacement of the westerly jet and the ITCZ. This study underscores the importance of the meridional organization of atmospheric circulation components in modulating monsoonal precipitation variations and calls for further reconstruction and modelling endeavors to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Strengths and Limitations of 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing in Revealing Temporal Microbial Community Dynamics	PLOS ONE												This study explored the short-term planktonic microbial community structure and resilience in Lake Lanier (GA, USA) while simultaneously evaluating the technical aspects of identifying taxa via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequence data. 16S rRNA gene amplicons generated from four temporally discrete samples were sequenced with 454 GS-FLX-Ti yielding similar to 40,000 rRNA gene sequences from each sample and representing similar to 300 observed OTUs. Replicates obtained from the same biological sample clustered together but several biases were observed, linked to either the PCR or sequencing-preparation steps. In comparisons with companion whole-community shotgun metagenome datasets, the estimated number of OTUs at each timepoint was concordant, but 1.5 times and similar to 10 times as many phyla and genera, respectively, were identified in the metagenomes. Our analyses showed that the 16S rRNA gene captures broad shifts in community diversity over time, but with limited resolution and lower sensitivity compared to metagenomic data. We also identified OTUs that showed marked shifts in abundance over four close timepoints separated by perturbations and tracked these taxa in the metagenome vs. 16S rRNA amplicon data. A strong summer storm had less of an effect on community composition than did seasonal mixing, which revealed a distinct succession of organisms. This study provides insights into freshwater microbial communities and advances the approaches for assessing community diversity and dynamics in situ.

In order to study relationships between seston food quality and energy transfer between primary producers and herbivores, we conducted five microcosm experiments in Castle Lake, California, USA during the summer of 1996. We simultaneously performed life table experiments to determine the effects of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) on Daphnia rosea growth, reproduction and survival. The results of these experiments suggest strong energy limitation of D. rosea growth in Castle lake during the study. D. rosea production was coupled with primary production in Castle Lake and in the microcosm experiments. D. rosea production efficiencies, i.e., the ratios of D. rosea productivity to primary productivity, decreased towards the end of the summer. A food quality index based on phytoplankton species composition and seston carbon to phosphorus ( C: P) ratio were good predictors of D. rosea production efficiencies. The predicted D. rosea production pattern based on phytoplankton composition and primary productivity matched the zooplankton biomass dynamics in Castle Lake during 1991.

The volume of water in the lake decreases with increasing activity, drying out prior to the magmatic eruptions. Salt-rich materials of various shapes were observed, falling from the volcanic plume during the active periods. In May 2011, salt flakes fell from the gas plume emitted from an intense fumarole when the acid crater lake was almost dry. The chemical composition of these salt flakes was similar to those of the salts formed by the drying of the crater lake waters, suggesting that they originated from the crater lake water. The salt flakes are likely formed by the drying up of the crater lake water droplets sprayed into the plume by the fumarolic gas jet. In late 2014, the crater lake dried completely, followed by the magmatic eruptions with continuous ash eruptions and intermittent Strombolian explosions. Spherical hollow salt shells were observed on several occasions during and shortly after the weak ash eruptions. The chemical composition of the salt shells was similar to the salts formed by the drying of the crater lake water. The hollow structure of the shells suggests that they were formed by the heating of hydrothermal solution droplets suspended by a mixed stream of gas and ash in the plume. The salt shells suggest the existence of a hydrothermal system beneath the crater floor, even during the course of magmatic eruptions. Instability of the magmatic-hydrothermal interface can cause phreatomagmatic explosions, which often occur at the end of the eruptive phase of this volcano.					; Yokoo, Akihiko/IWV-4504-2023; Geshi, Nobuo/L-9315-2018	Terada, Akihiko/0000-0001-5746-4912; Geshi, Nobuo/0000-0001-6472-9675													1880-5981					MAR 20	2018	70								46	10.1186/s40623-018-0798-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-018-0798-4													WOS:000428876900001

SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Non-marine carbonate rocks including cave, spring, stream, calcrete and lacustrine-palustrine sediments, are susceptible to early diagenetic processes. These can profoundly alter the carbonatefabric and affect paleoclimatic proxies. This review integrates recent insights into diagenesis of non-marine carbonates and in particular the variety of early diagenetic processes, and presents a conceptual framework to address them. With ability to study at smaller and smaller scales, down to nanometers, one can now observe diagenesis taking place the moment initial precipitates have formed, and continuing thereafter. Diagenesis may affect whole rocks, but it typically starts in nano- and micro-environments. The potential for diagenetic alteration depends on the reactivity of the initial precipitate, commonly being metastable phases like vaterite, Ca-oxalates, hydrous Mg-carbonates and aragonite with regard to the ambient fluid. Furthermore, organic compounds commonly play a crucial role in hosting these early transformations. Processes like neomorphism (inversion and recrystallization), cementation and replacement generally result in an overall coarsening of the fabric and homogenization of the wide range of complex, primary microtextures. If early diagenetic modifications are completed in a short time span compared to the (annual to millennial) time scale of interest, then recorded paleoenvironmental signals and trends could still acceptably reflect original, depositional conditions. However, even compact, non-marine carbonate deposits may behave locally and temporarily as open systems to crystal-fluid exchange and overprinting of one or more geo-chemical proxies is not unexpected. Looking to the future, relatively few studies have examined the behaviour of promising geochemical records, such as clumped isotope thermometry and (non-conventional) stable isotopes, in well-constrained diagenetic settings. Ongoing and future in-vitro and in-situ experimental approaches will help to investigate and detangle sequences of intermediate, diagenetic products, processes and controls, and to quantify rates of early diagenesis, bridging a gap between nanoscale, molecular lab studies and the fossil field rock record of non-marine carbonates.

Surface water inundation in the boreal-Arctic: potential impacts on regional methane emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Northern wetlands may be vulnerable to increased carbon losses from methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, under current warming trends. However, the dynamic nature of open water inundation and wetting/drying patterns may constrain regional emissions, offsetting the potential magnitude of methane release. Here we conduct a satellite data driven model investigation of the combined effects of surface warming and moisture variability on high northern latitude (>= 45 degrees N) wetland CH4 emissions, by considering (1) sub-grid scale changes in fractional water inundation (Fw) at 15 day, monthly and annual intervals using 25 km resolution satellite microwave retrievals, and (2) the impact of recent (2003-11) wetting/drying on northern CH4 emissions. The model simulations indicate mean summer contributions of 53 Tg CH4 yr(-1) from boreal-Arctic wetlands. Approximately 10% and 16% of the emissions originate from open water and landscapes with emergent vegetation, as determined from respective 15 day Fw means or maximums, and significant increases in regional CH4 efflux were observed when incorporating satellite observed inundated land fractions into the model simulations at monthly or annual time scales. The satellite Fw record reveals widespread wetting across the Arctic continuous permafrost zone, contrasting with surface drying in boreal Canada, Alaska and western Eurasia. Arctic wetting and summer warming increased wetland emissions by 0.56 Tg CH4 yr(-1) compared to the 2003-11 mean, but this was mainly offset by decreasing emissions (-0.38 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) in sub-Arctic areas experiencing surface drying or cooling. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring changes in surface moisture and temperature when assessing the vulnerability of boreal-Arctic wetlands to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions under a shifting climate.

Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level, respond dramatically to this threat, as observed in recent decades. In this Review, we discuss physical lake variables and their responses to climate change. Decreases in winter ice cover and increases in lake surface temperature modify lake mixing regimes and accelerate lake evaporation. Where not balanced by increased mean precipitation or inflow, higher evaporation rates will favour a decrease in lake level and surface water extent. Together with increases in extreme-precipitation events, these lake responses will impact lake ecosystems, changing water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation. Future research opportunities, including enhanced observation of lake variables from space (particularly for small water bodies), improved in situ lake monitoring and the development of advanced modelling techniques to predict lake processes, will improve our global understanding of lake responses to a changing climate. Climate change affects lakes worldwide and is predicted to continue to alter lake ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation rates, water levels and mixing regimes. This Review discusses recent and expected lake responses to climate change and looks towards future research opportunities in lake monitoring and modelling.

One such factor is whether they are CO2 or HCO3- users. In spring, CO2-only users such as the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense often predominate and develop a bloom despite of extremely low levels of ambient aqueous CO2 and its rather poor carbon-concentrating mechanism. Based on seasonal dynamics of calcium and carbonate concentrations, mass balance considerations, and the relationships between planktonic delta C-13 and aqueous CO2 (delta C-13), we claim that massive precipitation of calcite which occurs concomitant with the bloom supplies the CO2(aq) needed for the algae to develop and maintain the bloom. Besides riverine inflows that supply most HCO3-, Ca2+, P, N, Se(IV), and perhaps also picoplankton (that seem to serve as nuclei for calcite crystal growth) in the spring, the prevalence of relatively high temperatures and low winds also supports the bloom. The low wind restricts gas exchange and facilitates the gradual accumulated deficiency in CO2(aq) in surface water leading to higher pH and a raise in Omega(calcite) to an extent that induces massive calcite precipitation. By the end of this season, the capacity of the lake surface water to precipitate calcite is almost exhausted and bicarbonate users take over. About one third of the autochthonous calcite precipitating from the epilimnion dissolves in the lower water mass (LWM), which is undersaturated with respect to this mineral. However, only 22.5 % of the seasonal accumulation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; similar to 90 % HCO3-) in the LWM originates from calcite dissolution while 77.5 % originates through direct biodegradation processes under initially oxic and eventually anoxic conditions (mediated mostly by bacterial SO4 reduction) and from the underlying bed sediments through methanogenesis. A potential sink of CO2 and perhaps also of isotopic fractionation in the LWM may be its uptake by anammox organisms during the sub-oxic stage (Chap. 20). The almost steady delta C-13((DIC)) of approximately between 8 and 9 parts per thousand in the LWM approached in the anoxic stage represents the relative contribution of each of these pools as well as of the primary DIC pool in this layer before stratification commences.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						397	415		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_23	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400024
J	Mageed, AAA; Heikal, MT				Mageed, Adel Ali A.; Heikal, Mahmoud T.			Factors affecting seasonal patterns in epilimnion zooplankton community in one of the largest man-made lakes in Africa (Lake Nasser, Egypt)	LIMNOLOGICA												The objective of the study was to determine which factors regulate zooplankton organisms along Lake Nasser. Temperature, pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity, nutrients, and zooplankton abundance were measured. Twenty-three species of zooplankton were recorded in Lake Nasser included in Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera. Copepoda represented the main bulk of the community. The lowest standing stock of zooplankton was noticed during spring due to the highest fish predation during this season associated with the lowest turbidity. Big difference in temperature in Lake Nasser along the year round is considered as a controlling factor related to range of tolerance of species. The oscillation of the lake water level and the different factors affect the standing stock of zooplankton in the lake. Thus, continuous monitoring of Lake Nasser biota should be undertaken to follow the changes in the ecosystem. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Eckert, EM; Salcher, MM; Posch, T; Eugster, B; Pernthaler, J				Eckert, Ester M.; Salcher, Michaela M.; Posch, Thomas; Eugster, Bettina; Pernthaler, Jakob			Rapid successions affect microbial N-acetyl-glucosamine uptake patterns during a lacustrine spring phytoplankton bloom	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The vernal successions of phytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and viruses in temperate lakes result in alternating dominance of top-down and bottom-up factors on the bacterial community. This may lead to asynchronous blooms of bacteria with different life strategies and affect the channelling of particular components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) through microbial food webs. We followed the dynamics of several bacterial populations and of other components of the microbial food web throughout the spring phytoplankton bloom period in a pre-alpine lake, and we assessed bacterial uptake patterns of two constituents of the labile DOM pool (N-acetyl-glucosamine [ NAG] and leucine). There was a clear genotypic shift within the bacterial assemblage, from fast growing Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF) affiliated with Fluviicola and from Betaproteobacteria (BET) of the Limnohabitans cluster to more grazing resistant AcI Actinobacteria (ACT) and to filamentous morphotypes. This was paralleled by successive blooms of viruses and HNF. We also noted the transient rise of other CF (related to Cyclobacteriaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae) that are not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization with the general CF probe. Both, the average uptake rates of leucine and the fractions of leucine incorporating bacteria were approximately five to sixfold higher than of NAG. However, the composition of the NAG-active community was much more prone to genotypic successions, in particular of bacteria with different life strategies: While 'opportunistically' growing BET and CF dominated NAG uptake in the initial period ruled by bottom-up factors, ACT constituted the major fraction of NAG active cells during the subsequent phase of high predation pressure. This indicates that some ACT could profit from a substrate that might in parts have originated from the grazing of protists on their bacterial competitors.

Comparison of Annual Rates of Beach Changes Determined from Land Survey and Remote Sensing Techniques along the Coastline of the Nile Delta, Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Analyses have been undertaken to examine shoreline changes established from remote sensing data and ground survey at a total of 48 positions and beach profiles along the coastline of the Nile delta during 16-year period from 1984 to 2000. Multidate satellite dataset from Landsat TM and ETM sensors covering the Nile delta and refer to summer 1984 and winter 2000, respectively, have been utilized for mapping shoreline and calculating the average rate of beach changes between the two dates. Rates estimated from the two methods at corresponding positions show high correlation coefficient of 0.99 (significant at 99% level). The erosion and accretion patterns have been identified both on large-scale along the entire delta and locally at coastal sectors which are being experienced significant beach changes. The results reveal longshore patterns wherein erosion along a coastal stretch gives way to accretion in an adjacent stretch, refining the sub-cells previously identified within the littoral system of the delta. Maximum shoreline retreat occurs along the delta promontories, Rosetta [-96 m/yr (land survey); 102 m/yr (remote sensing)] and Damietta [-13 m/yr (land survey); -14.5 m/yr (remote sensing)]. Significant erosion has also occurred along the central bulge of the delta at Burullus headland, but at a lesser rate [-5.5 m/yr (land survey); -5.4 m/yr (remote sensing)]. Areas of shoreline advance exist within saddles or embayments between the promontories [maximum of 16.8 (land survey); 18.38 (remote sensing) at Abu Khashaba saddle] and also at updrift jetties [5.6m/yr (land survey) 5.3 m/yr (remote sensing) updrift of Burullus lake inletjetty]. On a coast-wide scale, the longshore transport rates of changes are affected locally by shoreline orientation versus incident waves and by the construction of protective structures built to combat areas of rapid erosion. The identified patterns of erosion versus accretion along the delta coastline have been ascribed to effect of the wave-induced longshore currents and sediment transport. These processes fluctuate in intensity and direction due to the degree of shoreline orientation and the existence of coastal protective structures.																			0972-9984	0973-7308				WIN	2009	12	1					42	58																WOS:000420124100005

Enclosures (8 m in diameter) were installed, open to the sediments, at both 3.5 and 11 m depths in Lac Croche, a small oligotrophic lake on the Canadian Shield. The abundance of protozoans, including obligate heterotrophic flagellates (HNAN) and potentially mixotrophic flagellates (MIXO), was examined in relation to the abundance of their prey, both heterotrophic bacteria (HBAC) and picocyanobacteria (PPICO). HBAC levels increased over the summer and were significantly higher in the nutrient enriched enclosures. While HBAC did not respond in a consistent manner to the presence of fish. the effect of nutrients was greater when fish were present. HBAC levels did not differ significantly between the shallow and deep enclosures. In contrast, PPICO were significantly affected by all 3 independent variables; nutrients had a strong overall negative effect on abundance and the presence of fish tended to increase their abundance particularly in the shallow enclosures. Similarly, nutrient additions resulted in significantly lower HNAN levels, but neither the presence of fish nor depth of the water column significantly affected HNAN. However, the lowest average HNAN concentrations were in the deep nutrient enriched enclosures without fish, where the highest populations of Daphnia middendorffiana developed. MIXO were most abundant early in the season (exceeding HNAN) but declined significantly by mid-summer and were generally not as abundant as HNAN. MIXO levels were significantly lower in the nutrient enriched enclosures. Depth of the water column had a significant effect on MIXO, but MIXO levels were not affected in a consistent manner by the presence of fish. Experimental results did not demonstrate that increases in nutrient levels would lead to increases in HNAN as current empirical models imply. There was no increase in HNAN abundance related to increased bacterial abundance.

J	Yu, G; Xue, B; Liu, J; Chen, X				Yu, G; Xue, B; Liu, J; Chen, X			LGM lake records from China and an analysis of climate dynamics using a modelling approach	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Lake-geological studies in China have reported that there were much higher lake levels and much fresher water than today at the last glacial maximum (LGM) in western China. A compilation of lake data in this study showed LGM conditions much drier than today in eastern China but somewhat wetter in western China. These E-W differential patterns of climate conditions were completely different from the modem dry-wet conditions with a N-S differential distribution. In this study palaeoclimate simulations by an AGCM coupled with land surface process model were used to explore the possible mechanisms of LGM climate in China. The results confirmed that the dry conditions in eastern China resulted from less summer precipitation due to the Pacific Subtropical High occupying eastern China and the decline in the summer monsoon. The wet conditions in western China were produced by a decrease in evaporation due to a low temperature on land surface at the LGM and increase in precipitation. Two experiments of the palaeoclimate simulations with different land surface of modem and palaeo-vegetations have been designed to test the discrepancies of simulated LGM climate with in precipitation and P-E fields. The results suggested that the feedback from the Asian land surface within the climate system would amplify and modify external forcing, leading to marked climate changes in China.

Traces can be seen in broken speleothems, growth anomalies in speleothems, cave sediment deformation structures, displacements along fractures and bedding plane slip, incasion (rock fall) and co-seismic fault displacements. Where earthquake origins can be proven, these traces constitute important archives of local and even regional earthquake activity. However, other processes that can generate the same or very similar deformation features have to be excluded before cave damage can be interpreted as earthquake induced. Most sensitive and therefore most valuable for the tracing of strong earthquake shocks in caves are long and slender speleothems, such as soda straws, and deposits of well-bedded, water-saturated silty sand infillings, particularly in caves close to the earth's surface. Less easily proven is a co-seismic origin of an incasion and other forms of cave damage. The loads and creep movements of sediment and ice fillings in caves can cause severe damage to speleothems which have been frequently misinterpreted as evidence of earthquakes. For the dating of events in geological archives, it is important to demonstrate that such events happened at approximately the same time, i.e. within the error bars of the dating methods. A robust earthquake explanation for cave damage can only be achieved by the adoption of appropriate methods of direct dating of deformation events in cave archives combined with correlation of events in other geological archives outside caves, such as the deformation of lake and flood-plain deposits, locations of rock falls and active fault displacements.																			1383-4649					JUL	2006	10	3					371	388		10.1007/s10950-006-9017-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10950-006-9017-z													WOS:000241579900007

This freshwater heterotrich has dark pigmented cortical granules and lives autotrophically with endosymbiotic algae. The effect of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation on primary production was analyzed during summer 2003-2004 in Lake Moreno Oeste, a highly transparent ultraoligotrophic lake (mean summer K-d = 0.16 m(-1)). Primary production (PP) was measured in the field in the euphotic zone during both static and variable-depth incubations. Static exposure of the organisms was examined at different depths (0.30, 10, and 20 m), and the variable depth exposure involved experimental containers moved continuously up and down the epilimnion (0-15 m). In the static exposure closest to the surface and in the mobile incubation, quartz tubes were incubated with and without a UV-B screen (Mylar (TM)). Additionally, PP was measured in the laboratory with and without previous exposure to a UV-B lamp (290-315 nm). S. araucanus was present throughout the summer with highest abundances at or above 15 m in depth. A high proportion of the ciliate population (80%) was, therefore, exposed to UV radiation, and between 30% and 60% of the population occupied depths at which UV-B (305 nm) exceeded 1% of surface incidence. PP values were higher in the epilimnion than below it and were not reduced by exposure to high irradiances of PAR+UV-A and PAR+UV-A+UV-B. The laboratory experiments showed no difference between UV-B and PAR preexposure treatments. The variable-depth epilimnetic incubations gave similar PP values and did not differ from the static incubations. The average PAR irradiance of the epilimnion was high, around 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), which was the value at which S. araucanus reached a saturation level in the laboratory. In contrast, the incubations at 20 In differed significantly from those in the epilimnion, exhibiting lower values, except when PAR irradiance was higher than 100 mu mol photons m(-2) s-1. These results indicate that pigmented mixotrophs like S. araucanus achieve high population densities in the epilimnion because they receive sufficient irradiance (PAR between 100 and 1,600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) to allow endosymbiotic algae to produce.

J	Zhang, Y; Li, CY; Shi, XH; Li, C				Zhang, Yan; Li, ChangYou; Shi, XiaoHong; Li, Chao			The migration of total dissolved solids during natural freezing process in Ulansuhai Lake	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												High total dissolved solids (TDS) content is one of the most important pollution contributors in lakes in arid and semiarid areas. Ulansuhai Lake, located in Urad Qianqi, Inner Mongolia, China, was selected as the object of study. Temperatures and TDS contents of both ice and under-ice water were collected together with corresponding ice thickness. TDS profiles were drawn to show the distribution of TDS and to describe TDS migration. The results showed that about 80% (that is 3.602x10(8) kg) of TDS migrated from ice to water during the whole growth period of ice. Within ice layer, TDS migration only occurred during initial ice-on period, and then perished. The TDS in ice decreased with increasing ice thickness, following a negative exponential-like trend. Within under-ice water, the TDS migrated from ice-water interface to the entire water column under the effect of concentration gradient until the water TDS content was uniform. In winter, 6.044x10(7) kg (16.78% of total TDS) TDS migrated from water to sediment, which indicated that winter is the best time for dredging sediment. The migration effect gives rise to TDS concentration in under-ice water and sediment that is likely to affect ecosystem and water quality of the Yellow River. The trend of transfer flux of ice-water and water-sediment interfaces is similar to that of ice growth rate, which reveals that ice growth rate is one of the determinants of TDS migration. The process and mechanism of TDS migration can be referenced by research on other lakes with similar TDS content in cold and arid areas.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024														1674-6767	2194-7783				MAR	2012	4	1					85	94		10.3724/SP.J.1227.2012.00085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1227.2012.00085													WOS:000300387600011

It has been estimated that as many as 79% of the rivers in the Alps have been affected by the presence of hydropower plants. In this context, the shutting down of hydropower plants on a group of Alpine lakes represented a good opportunity to study the ecological impact on them. We selected nine lakes that had been affected and nine that had not, and analysed the differences in environment, littoral diatoms and zoobenthos, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish. Results showed that benthic biota-diatoms and zoobenthos- were the most affected by water-level drawdown during winter months. Even six years after the end of hydroelectric operations, diatom species richness and diversity were lower in impacted lakes. Assemblage structure was different for both diatoms and zoobenthos. Phytoplankton and zooplankton were similar in impacted and unaffected lakes in terms of both species richness (and diversity) and assemblage structure. The degree of impact on fish was unclear because illegal stocking of lakes with allochthonous fish species had taken place. This study showed that compared to limnetic biota, littoral communities were the most affected by the decrease in water volume every winter. Six years after the end of hydroelectric operations, diatoms, and to lesser extent zoobenthos, were still different compared to those in natural (unaffected) lakes. Planktic communities seem to be either more resistant to the disturbances, or else able to recover more quickly to their former condition.

In 2009 and 2015, detailed (700+ sample sites) surveys were undertaken to assess the impacts of invasive dreissenid mussels in lake Simcoe (Ontario, Canada). In 2009, zebra mussels were dominant, accounting for 84.3% of invasive mussel biomass recorded. In 2015, quagga mussels dominated (88.5% of invasive mussel biomass) and had expanded into profundal (>20 m water depth) sites and onto soft (mud/silt) substrates with a mean profundal density of 887 mussels/m(2) (2015) compared to similar to 39 mussels/m(2) in 2009. Based on our annual benthos monitoring, at a subset of similar to 30 sites, this shift from zebra to quagga mussels occurred similar to 2010 and is likely related to a population decline of zebra mussels in waterbodies where both species are present, as recorded elsewhere in the Great lakes Region. As the initial invasion of dreissenid mussels caused widespread ecological changes in lake Simcoe, we are currently investigating the effects this change in species dominance, and their expansion into the profundal zone, will have on the lake; and our environmental management strategies. Areas of future study will include: changes in the composition of benthos, fish, or phytoplankton communities; increased water clarity and reduction of the spring phytoplankton bloom; energy/nutrient cycling; and fouling of anthropogenic in-lake infrastructures (e.g. water treatment intakes) built at depths >25 m to avoid previous zebra mussel colonization.

In spite of substantial release of sediment P over the growing season, epilimnentic P concentrations were overwhelming dominated by external sources, and thus insensitive to changes in withdrawal depth. Nor did surface withdrawal increase flushing rate sufficiently to affect phytoplankton biomass. In one year, an increase in thermal stability, due in part to surface withdrawal, permitted the development of a metalimnetic chlorophyll maximum in a summer that also experienced relatively low populations of 'nuisance' cyanophytes, and can be regarded as a positive effect of the change in operations.																			0020-9309						1997	82	4					531	543		10.1002/iroh.19970820410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820410													WOS:000071243800007
J	Herzschuh, U				Herzschuh, U			Palaeo-moisture evolution in monsoonal Central Asia during the last 50,000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The late-Quaternary climate history of monsoonal Central Asia was inferred from 75 palaeoclimatic records which provide information about moisture conditions in the last 50 ka (or part of this period). Wet conditions occurred during middle and late Marine Isotope Stage 3, while the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was characterized by dry climate conditions in the region. A stepwise climate amelioration is suggested by the climate records following the LGM. Several climate signals of this period, which were reported from high-latitude ice core records, are preserved in archives from monsoonal Central Asia as well. During the early Holocene, high effective moisture was inferred from most records from the area dominated by the Indian Monsoon (e.g. the Tibetan Plateau) suggesting that Holocene optimal climate conditions occurred there during this period. In contrast, areas which are dominated by the South-East Asian monsoon (SE Monsoon) and the Westerlies (in north-western and north-central China, Mongolia) do not uniformly show an early Holocene climate optimum. For this area optimal conditions prevailed during the mid-Holocene. These apparent contradictions can possibly be explained by the regional uplift and descent of air masses in the Holocene. During the early Holocene, strengthened insolation possibly caused an enhanced low-level convergence over the Tibetan Plateau which led to the intensification of the summer monsoon. The strong air uplift caused intensified precipitation and air divergence in the upper troposphere over the Tibetan Plateau. The areas adjacent to the north therefore experienced an intensified descent of air masses and consequently increased aridity. The majority of the palaeoclimatic records suggest reduced effective moisture since the late Holocene in the region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Multiphase calcification associated with the atmophytic cyanobacterium Scytonema julianum	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Scytonema julianum, which is an atmophytic cyanobacterium that lives in small clusters in shaded vadose settings throughout the world, is prone to rapid calcification. Specimens found on cavity walls in an inactive spring tower located in Shiqiang (Stone Wall) in China and cavity walls in a breccia that fills sinkholes in dolostones of the Cayman Formation (Miocene) on Grand Cayman are morphologically identical. The microbes (4-11 pm diameter) are encased with thick, well-developed calcified sheaths with external diameters of 11 to 25 pm, which developed through the sequential precipitation of amorphous CaCO3 (ACC), acicular calcite crystals, triradiate calcite crystals, and dendrite calcite crystals. The paragenetic relationship of these precipitates to the skeletal rhombic crystals that cover some specimens is unknown. Precipitation probably took place in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that covered the microbes when they were alive. Critically, the type of crystal evident on the surface of the sheath depends on the thickness of the calcified sheath, which is in accord with the sequential development of the different crystal forms. Available evidence indicates that precipitation was largely "microbially influenced" rather than "environment influenced" and also demonstrates that crystals commonly morphed from one crystal form into another as precipitation progressed. There is, for example, clear evidence that the dendrite crystals developed from the triradiate crystals. S. julianum can play a significant role in the development of microbialites in vadose settings by acting as nuclei for CaCO3 precipitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McLaughlin, JW				McLaughlin, James W.			Forest Soil Calcium Dynamics and Water Quality: Implications for Forest Management Planning	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Forest management planning is increasingly focused at the landscape scale. The resulting increase in planning unit size has fueled debate about forest sustainability, particularly at local scales. In boreal and temperate regions, Ca depletion in forest and aquatic ecosystems is a recently debated issue. Planning decisions that sustain forest soil and surface water Ca require identification of sites sensitive to Ca loss and application of silvicultural prescriptions that maintain background Ca pools and fluxes. Therefore, I synthesized data on forest Ca cycling and export and long-term (>10 yr) soil exchangeable Ca pools and changes in surface water quality. Findings indicated that hardwood forest soils contained over three-times more (P < 0.05), their catchments exported three-times more (P < 0.05), and through leaf-litter fall they recycled twice (p < 0.01) as much Ca as conifer-mixedwood forests. Nonetheless, over similar timeframes, forest floor in mature hardwood stands lost more (P < 0.05) Ca than did conifer-mixedwood soils, which was consistent with net stream and lake Ca losses (P < 0.01). However, surface water acid neutralizing capacity increased (P < 0.01), possibly due to greater sulfate declines relative to Ca. On average, based on soil concentrations and contents, forestry practices did not significantly deplete Ca in either cover type. Study results indicate that stand-and catchment-scale forest Ca pools and fluxes can be used to identify areas potentially sensitive to Ca depletion and water quality degradation. However, considerable variation exists in Ca and acidification responses to external stressors, limiting spatial and temporal projections.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY-JUN	2014	78	3					1003	1020		10.2136/sssaj2013.11.0474	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.11.0474													WOS:000341564100032

Hydroclimate and Ecosystem Changes in the Colorado Rocky Mountains Since the Last Glacial Maximum	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												During the Last Glacial Maximum, wetter and cooler conditions drove expanded pluvial lake systems throughout the southwestern United States. Here, we aim to understand the drivers of these hydroclimate changes using new biomarker records from Cumbres Bog, a high-elevation fen (3,050 m) in the San Juan Mountain Range in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The leaf wax hydrogen isotope record, which we interpret as reflecting changes in the proportions of seasonal precipitation sources reaching Cumbres Bog, indicates that winter moisture delivery was reduced at the LGM, increased suddenly during the deglaciation at ca. 14.8 kyr, and then declined rapidly at ca. 11.5 kyr in association with exceptional early Holocene drought. Winter precipitation abruptly recovered at ca. 8.2 ka and remained high throughout the mid- to late-Holocene. BrGDGT-derived temperatures indicate that the southern Rockies were ca. 6.5 degrees C colder during the LGM. Deglacial warming commenced at ca. 18.1 ka, reaching peak temperatures similar to 2 degrees C greater than present in conjunction with the peak mid-Holocene drought. Deglacial warming was interrupted by small (similar to 1-2 degrees C) abrupt cooling events coincident with the YD and HS1. These deglacial and Holocene hydroclimate changes were accompanied by changes in terrestrial vegetation, lake evolution, and microbial community changes. Indices based on isoGDGT abundances reveal microbial community changes associated with primary succession and the expansion of methanogenic Archaea with deglacial warming. Past temperature variations significantly altered carbon cycling at the Cumbres Bog site and suggest that high alpine lacustrine ecosystems could be particularly vulnerable to future anthropogenic warming.					; Shanahan, Timothy/B-1298-2012	Shanahan, Timothy/0000-0002-3831-3198; Todd, Victoria L/0000-0001-5510-2563													2572-4517	2572-4525				JUL	2025	40	7							e2024PA005049	10.1029/2024PA005049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024PA005049													WOS:001522574800001

Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain H-8(T) indicated that the new organism represented a new genus and species of alpha-1 subclass of the Proteobacteria. The major fatty acids of strain H-8(T) are 16:0, 18:1 omega7c; the rare fatty acid 19:0 2OH cyclo 11,12 is also present. Ubiquinone 9 is the major respiratory quinone, the polar lipids are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphaticlylglycerol in addition to two unidentified aminolipids. The new isolate forms red-colored colonies, flocculates in liquid media, is heterotrophic and strictly aerobic. Thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate, but an increase in biomass could not be measured because of the flocculating behavior. Bacteriochloropyll a was detected by direct spectrophotometric analysis when the organism was grown at 30 degreesC, but could not be detected after growth at 50 degreesC. pufL and pufM genes were present. Heterotrophic growth of strain H-8(T) occurs on a few carbohydrates, amino acids and organic acids. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, physiological and biochemical characteristics, we propose that strain H-8(T) represents a new genus and a new species most closely related to Roseococcus thiosulfatophilus for which we propose the name Rubritepida flocculans.					; Alarico, Susana/KZU-0510-2024; Rainey, Fred/AAG-7996-2019; Empadinhas, Nuno/G-3118-2011; Schumann, Peter/AAL-1098-2020	da Costa, Milton/0000-0003-4027-4412; Alarico, Susana/0000-0002-1615-6099; Schumann, Peter/0000-0002-2251-4091													0723-2020					AUG	2002	25	2					198	206		10.1078/0723-2020-00116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0723-2020-00116								12353873					WOS:000178458000005
J	Varol, M; Tokatli, C				Varol, Memet; Tokatli, Cem			Impact of paddy fields on water quality of Gala Lake (Turkey): An important migratory bird stopover habitat	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Gala Lake is an internationally important lake due to its location on one of the world's most important bird migration routes. For this reason, water quality of the lake is of great concern. However, the lake surrounded by paddy fields may face eutrophication and toxic metal contamination due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. In this study, impact of paddy fields on water quality of the Gala Lake was investigated. The concentrations of metal(loid)s and physico-chemical parameters in surface water samples taken from the lake were measured and compared with water quality guidelines. Also, human health risks and contamination status of metal(loid)s were assessed. The mean NO2, SRP and BOD concentrations in the lake exceeded the permissible levels for both salmonid and cyprinid waters. The mean BOD value indicated contaminated water quality in the lake, while mean COD and SRP values indicated lightly contaminated water quality. The mean As, Cr and Pb values in the winter exceeded the drinking water limits set by WHO and EC, while the mean Cr and Zn values exceeded the limit values for the protection of freshwater aquatic organisms set by USEPA. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and the degree of contamination values in the winter indicated that the lake water is moderately polluted. Health risk assessment results revealed that As and Cr in the lake water via ingestion exposure pathway may pose both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks to the residents. The results of this study indicated that paddy fields are a major source of nutrients, organic matter and toxic metal(loid)s to the Gala Lake. To improve the water quality of the lake, we suggest that excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides should be controlled to reduce metal(loid) and nutrient loads from the paddy fields.					; Varol, Memet/F-6797-2013; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; Varol, Memet/0000-0001-6475-0570; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 15	2021	287								117640	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117640		JUN 2021						34182394					WOS:000703965000003

Urban pocket-beach morphodynamics along the wave-dominated southwest coast of Lake Michigan: An analysis of shoreline and sand volumetric changes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Many of the world's beaches are embayed, but while a large body of work addresses the geomorphology of pocket beaches in oceanic settings, little is known about urban analogs, especially within the Great Lakes of North America. Groins and jetties shelter these systems from direct interaction with littoral processes, which elsewhere can influence how changes in lake level, winter-ice cover, and wave climate impact beach evolution. We address the direct controls of these forcing parameters on beach morphodynamics over a 33-yr period at North Point Beach, which is confined to an engineered 'container' along Lake Michigan's wave-dominated SW margin. Analysis of near-annual beach change suggests lake level change is the dominant geomorphic driver over inter-annual to decadal timeframes, with winter ice playing a secondary role. Pocket-beach shoreline positions were found to be unreliable indicators of sand volumetric changes. Lake-level rise facilitated shoreline retreat and overwash-induced beach accretion while high lake levels created the accommodation for additional sands to enter the embayment. This is important for coastal managers to consider when developing mitigation strategies for ongoing lake-level fluctuations and anticipated regional climate impacts. This foundational assessment has implications for embayed beaches of the greater Chicago coastal margin (n > 20), where many other site specific variables (e.g., groin orientations and shoreline aspect) may factor into nearshore and onshore beach morphodynamics. Continued research into urban pocket beaches of the Great Lakes stands to offer useful information on the impacts of littoral fragmentation on coastal sediment routing during different lake-level phases and degrees of littoral interconnectivity.

Limiting temperature ranges have been studied for various non-native species; however, such previous assessments of species-specific temperature thresholds may be inadequate. Because several non-native crayfish species prefer warmer water temperatures, introductions were generally assumed to occur during preferable, warmer periods. However, despite the generality, traditionally considered 'warm-water' species are gradually appearing in new habitats, which were previously considered too cold for successful establishment Newly discovered overwintering abilities of these species are likely related to the winter stratification in lentic ecosystems, which maintain tolerable conditions. To understand better the survivability of two such non-native species, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii and marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis individuals were abruptly subjected to a thermic shock which lowered the water temperature from 20 degrees C (room temperature) to 6 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 2 degrees C, thus mimicking the release by pet owners during various phases of winter. The survival rate and foraging activity were monitored for up to 98 days. Procambarus clarkii showed a considerable higher survival rate at low temperatures (4 degrees C, 2 degrees C) compared to that of P. virginalis with neither sex nor size differences evident. Our findings reveal the ability of warm water invaders to withstand a shock during introduction at low temperature periods without acclimation.

A semi-Markov competing-process approach is used in our models, where the age-dependent system failure behavior is treated as a race among engine components. Howard's one-set competing process model is implemented and extended to two sets of competing processes. An efficient enumeration procedure is presented to select the replacement policy which produces the minimum expected cost for the operating season. Computer codes are developed using the above models, and several examples are considered. Sensitivity analyses are performed for several parameters for which we have insufficient or no information from the industry to see their influence on the minimal expected costs and corresponding replacement policies.																			0377-2217					NOV 25	1991	55	2					165	182		10.1016/0377-2217(91)90221-G	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-2217(91)90221-G													WOS:A1991GZ78100005

Levels of aluminum, lead, and zinc in the water column were sharply elevated in the most acidic lakes, with values similar to acidified systems elsewhere. Seasonal fluctuations occurred, with lead displaying peak concentrations in all lakes during the fall sampling period. Analyses of core samples of lake sediment indicated that while lead concentrations exhibited a typical sharp increase in most recent sediments, cadmium and zinc levels in the upper layers were substantially lower than values reported for similar systems elsewhere. As expected, manganese concentrations generally decreased in the upper sediment layers in the acidic lakes, while aluminum varied dramatically between systems.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	1987	16	4					383	390		10.1007/BF01055258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01055258								3606198					WOS:A1987H285000001
J	KEAST, A				KEAST, A			FOOD AND FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS OF YOUNG FISH IN THE 1ST WEEKS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF EXOGENOUS FEEDING IN LAKE OPINICON, ONTARIO	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Young fish of 6 spp. in an open water community all began their exogenous feeding by taking nauplii and small cyclopoids of body length (less tail) of 0.1-0.3 mm. Appearance of larvae of the different species in the system was sequential, the resource being utilized by the different species in turn. The sequence was Perca flavescens, Percina caprodes, Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Ambloplites rupestris, Lepomis gibbosus and L. macrochirus. The larvae and juveniles changes their diet rapidly as they grew. Fish 10-14 days after hatching and 8-10 mm in length, i.e., close to the beginning of the juvenile period, consumed larger-bodied prey items (including several genera of Cladocera) and had more diversified diets than the 4.5-6.0 mm 1st-feeding larvae. These differences and progressive dispersal of the larger young from the area minimized the chances of food competition between batches of young of different ages. The composition of the fish community of larvae changed from week to week as new species entered it, increased in size and departed. Patterns of food utilization changed accordingly. Numbers of cyclopoids, their nauplii and Bosmina longirostris, fell rapidly in May, early June and did not increase again until August. These changes coincided with the rise and fall in numbers of the young fish in the habitat.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1980	5	4					305	314		10.1007/BF00005185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005185													WOS:A1980KZ21000002

Advancing freshwater ecological forecasts: Harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological models help provide forecasts of ecosystem responses to natural and anthropogenic stresses. However, their ability to create reliable predictions requires forecasts with track records sufficiently long to build confidence, skill assessments, and treating uncertainty quantitatively. We use Lake Erie harmful algal blooms as a case study to help formalize ecological forecasting. Key challenges for models include uncertainty in the deterministic structure of the load-bloom relationship and the need to assess alternative drivers (e.g., biologically available phosphorus load, spring load, longer term cumulative load) with a larger dataset. We enhanced a Bayesian model considering new information and an expanded data set, test it through cross validation and blind forecasts, quantify and discuss its uncertainties, and apply it for assessing historical and future scenarios. Allowing a segmented relationship between bloom size and spring load indicates that loading above 0.15 Gg/month will have a substantially higher marginal impact on bloom size. The new model explains 84 % of interannual variability (9.09 Gg RMSE) when calibrated to the 19-year data set and 66 % of variability in cross validation (12.58 Gg RMSE). Blind forecasts explain 84 % of HAB variability between 2014 and 2020, which is substantially better than the actual forecast track record (R2 = 0.32) over this same period. Because of internal phosphorus recycling, represented by the long-term cumulative load, it could take over a decade for HABs to fully respond to loading reductions, depending on the pace of those reductions. Thus, the desired speed and endpoint of the lake's recovery should be considered when updating and adaptively managing load reduction targets. Results are discussed in the context of ecological forecasting best pactices: incorporate new knowledge and data in model construction; account for multiple sources of uncertainty; evaluate predictive skill through validation and hindcasting; and answer management questions related to both short-term forecasts and long-term scenarios.					; wang, yuchen/AED-4066-2022; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018	Obenour, Daniel/0000-0002-7459-218X; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2023	856		1						158959	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158959		SEP 2022						36155036					WOS:000870101000003

Using the PIV technique, the velocity profiles are measured and compared with the numerical solutions based on an elasto-viscoplastic rheological model, in which an elastic spring is serially connected to a regularized Bingham viscoplastic model. The rheological parameters, such as shear modulus of elasticity, yield stress and viscosity, are estimated from steady-shear measurements.

J	Liu, H; Zhou, XF				Liu, Hua; Zhou, Xuefei			Wildfire and Its Impact on the Ecosystem in Guizhou Province	FIRE AND MATERIALS												In February 2024, a total of 221 recorded excess wildfires occurred throughout Guizhou Province. The atypical weather conditions attributed to climate change, seasonal drought during the non-monsoon period, and human activities associated with the Spring Festival are identified as the primary factors contributing to this period of extensive wildfires. To facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the local ecosystem, analyses were conducted on precipitation, temperature, air quality index records, and water quality monitoring of downstream lakes and rivers. The early onset of the rainy season in April exacerbated soil erosion in Guizhou Province, where 81% of the terrain is mountainous. The repercussions of the excess wildfires on the downstream surface water ecosystem may persist for several months. The findings revealed significant differences in biomass accumulation and response times between rivers and lakes. A more thorough understanding of the impacts of wildfires on water and soil is essential for the formulation of effective recovery policies aimed at safeguarding downstream water resources.																			0308-0501	1099-1018				AUG	2025	49	5			SI		550	558		10.1002/fam.3257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fam.3257		NOV 2024											WOS:001363725000001

Catchment properties as predictors of greenhouse gas concentrations across a gradient of boreal lakes	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Boreal lakes are the most abundant lakes on Earth. Changes in acid rain deposition, climate, and catchment land use have increased lateral fluxes of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), resulting in a widespread browning of boreal freshwaters. This browning affects the aqueous communities and ecosystem processes, and boost emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) CH4, CO2, and N2O. In this study, we predicted biotic saturation of GHGs in boreal lakes by using a set of chemical, hydrological, climate, and land use parameters. For this purpose, concentrations of GHGs and nutrients (organic C, -P, and -N) were determined in surface water samples from 73 lakes in south-eastern Norway covering wide ranges in DOM and nutrient concentrations, as well as catchment properties and land use. The spatial variation in saturation of each GHG is related to explanatory variables. Catchment characteristics (hydrological and climate parameters) such as lake size and summer precipitation, as well as NDVI, were key determinants when fitting GAM models for CH4 and CO2 saturation (explaining 71 and 54%, respectively), while summer precipitation and land use data were the best predictors for the N2O saturation, explaining almost 50% of deviance. Our results suggest that lake size, precipitation, and terrestrial primary production in the watershed control the saturation of GHG in boreal lakes. These predictions based on the 73-lake dataset was validated against an independent dataset from 46 lakes in the same region. Together, this provides an improved understanding of drivers and spatial variation in GHG saturation in boreal lakes across wide gradients of lake and catchment properties. The assessment highlights the need to incorporate multiple explanatory parameters in prediction models of GHGs for extrapolation across the boreal biome.

J	Van Balen, RT; Forzoni, A; Van Dam, JA				Van Balen, R. T.; Forzoni, A.; Van Dam, J. A.			Active faulting and folding along the Jumilla Fault Zone, northeastern Betics, Spain	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Jumilla Fault Zone (JFZ) is an ENE-WSW topographic lineament in the external part of the eastern Betic Cordillera. It represents an active fault Three small basins are aligned along the JFZ, the La Celia-, Alqueria- and Jumilla basins. The tectonic geomorphology of the La Celia- and Alqueria basins consists of folds, a set of normal fault scarps, strike-slip lineaments, fault-springs, tectonically-modified drainage lines and elevated gypsum/anhydrite diapirs. Two of the scarps are normal faults generated by the extensional collapse of one of the folds. The other scarps are secondary normal faults generated by transtensional left-lateral motions along the JFZ. Normal fault scarps that developed on conglomerates are considerably steeper (similar to 30 degrees) than those affecting softer manly materials (<10 degrees) as a consequence of their different erodibilities. Two natural springs reveal the sealing nature of the normal faults, which has resulted in a segmented groundwater system. These springs are the sources of the two largest ramblas (gullies) in the area. The onset of fault activity is constrained by the late Tortonian-Messinian age of the sedimentary rocks in the basins. Interbedded lavaflows and lamproitic dykes in the lacustrine sediments have been dated at 7.6-72 Ma. However, the morphology of fault scarps and relief of the diapirs suggest a younger age of the deformation. Results from modelling of fault scarp evolution indicate Middle Pleistocene and younger ages of faulting and scarp formation. Furthermore, in at least one of the fault scarps, Quaternary alluvial-pediment deposits are involved in the deformation. The drainage pattern anomalies and moderate earthquake activity (Mb 42) in the JFZ also indicate slow ongoing tectonic activity. In addition, the ENE prolongation of the JFZ (outside the study area) shows geodetic displacement rates of approximately 2 mm/year. We thus conclude that the JFZ is still active, despite the general lack of post-Messinian deposits in the studied basins. The discrepancy between the age of the tectonic landforms and the late Neogene age of the basin infill can be explained by an endo- to exhorheic change in the drainage system, due to the capture of the ancient basin lake system by tributaries of the nearby Segura river. The cessation of sedimentation in the basins resulted in the preservation of tectonic landforms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Persistent Urban Influence on Surface Water Quality via Impacted Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Growing urban environments stress hydrologic systems and. impact downstream water quality. We examined a third-order catchment that transitions from an undisturbed mountain environment into urban Salt Lake City, Utah. We performed synoptic surveys during al range of seasonal baseflow conditions and utilized multiple lines of, evidence to identify mechanisms by which urbanization impacts water quality. Surface water chemistry did not change appreciably until several kilometers into the urban environment, where concentrations of solutes such as, chloride and nitrate increase quickly in a gaining reach: Groundwater springs discharging in this gaining system demonstrate the role of contaminated baseflow from an aquifer in driving stream chemistry. Hydrometric and hydrochemical observations were used to estimate that the aquifer contains approximately 18% water sourced from the urban area. The carbon and nitrogen dynamics indicated the urban aquifer also serves as a biogeochemical reactor. The evidence of surface water groundwater exchange on a spatial scale of kilometers and time scale of months to years suggests a need to evolve the hydrologic model of anthropogenic impacts to urban water quality to include exchange with the subsurface. This has implications on the space and time scales of water quality mitigation efforts.

The range in total body lengths was 11 mm when year-0 fish were first captured on June 22-25, and this range increased to 26 mm by Sept. 8-12. The size divergence was not due to a protracted or disrupted spawning period and, instead, appeared to be underlain by differences in diet and prey availability. Diets of small and large year-0 largemouth bass (less than and greater than the cohort mean length, respectively) differed progressively over the summer. Large year-0 fish maintained a diverse diet of which fish prey always constituted 25-30% by volume. In contrast, small year-0 largemouth bass shifted from a diet comprised of zooplankton, aquatic insects, and larval fish in July to one dominated by zooplankton, and including no fish, in Sept. The diet shift of the small individuals occurred when fish prey became too large to handle. Some forage fish were always within the manageable size range for large year-0 largemouth bass and, consequently, large individuals were able to maintain fish in their diet. Analysis of the gross energetic value of the diets showed that larger year-0 individuals obtained a higher energy content in their diet, relative to the small individuals.

Nitrogen Limitation of Intense and Toxic Cyanobacteria Blooms in Lakes within Two of the Most Visited Parks in the USA: The Lake in Central Park and Prospect Park Lake	TOXINS												The Lake in Central Park (LCP) and Prospect Park Lake (PPL) in New York City (NYC), USA, are lakes within two of the most visited parks in the USA. Five years of nearshore sampling of these systems revealed extremely elevated levels of cyanobacteria and the toxin, microcystin, with microcystin levels averaging 920 mu g L-1 and chlorophyll a from cyanobacterial (cyano-chla) populations averaging 1.0 x 10(5) mu g cyano-chla L-1. Both lakes displayed elevated levels of orthophosphate (DIP) relative to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) during summer months when DIN:DIP ratios were < 1. Nutrient addition and dilution experiments revealed that N consistently limited cyanobacterial populations but that green algae were rarely nutrient limited. Experimental additions of public drinking water that is rich in P and, to a lesser extent N, to lake water significantly enhanced cyanobacterial growth rates in experiments during which N additions also yielded growth enhancement. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the extreme microcystin levels during blooms in these highly trafficked lakes represent a potential human and animal health threat and that supplementation of these artificial lakes with public drinking water to maintain water levels during summer may promote the intensity and N limitation of blooms.

Cyanobacterial blooms present a serious health concern when they occur in water bodies that supply potable water. Lake Kinneret, the major water source in Israel, was characterized for many years by relatively stable phytoplankton populations which fluctuated with the seasons in a quite predictable manner. An exceptional bloom of the filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, which produces hepatotoxin, was observed for the first time in Lake Kinneret during the fall of 1994. Cylindrospermopsin, a toxin produced by A. ovalisporum, was purified and chemically characterized.

J	Swift-LaPointe, T; White, RH; Radic, V				Swift-LaPointe, Taylor; White, Rachel H.; Radic, Valentina			A hybrid statistical-dynamical forecast of seasonal streamflow for a catchment in the Upper Columbia River basin in Canada	FRONTIERS IN WATER												We explore a hybrid statistical-dynamical approach as a methodology for potentially improving total seasonal streamflow volume forecasts at a key lake reservoir in the Upper Columbia River basin, a region vital for hydroelectric power generation in British Columbia. Seasonal streamflow forecasts in this basin at early or mid-winter initialization times often exhibit limited skill due to the lack of snowpack information in the initial conditions. Our method integrates temperature and precipitation data from the ECMWF seasonal forecasts (SEAS5) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. To our knowledge, this is the first time an LSTM has been used specifically for predicting total seasonal streamflow volume in this basin. When forced with reanalysis data (ERA5), the LSTM model performs substantially better at predicting total seasonal streamflow when trained and applied at a monthly timescale, as compared to the more typical daily timescale used in previous streamflow LSTM applications. In the case study region, when forecasts are initialized on 1 January, only three months of meteorological forecast skill are needed to achieve strong predictive skill of total seasonal streamflow (R-2>0.7), attributed to accurate representation of snowpack build up in the winter months. The hybrid forecast, with the LSTM forced by SEAS5 data, tends to underestimate seasonal volumes in most years, primarily due to biases in the SEAS5 input data. While bias correction of the inputs improves model performance, no skill beyond that of a forecast with average meteorological conditions as input is achieved. The effectiveness of the hybrid approach is constrained by the accuracy of seasonal meteorological forcings, although the methodology shows potential for improved predictions of seasonal streamflow volumes if seasonal meteorological forecasts can be improved.																				2624-9375				JUN 9	2025	7								1595898	10.3389/frwa.2025.1595898	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1595898													WOS:001513148000001
J	Mohamed, MN; Taylor, WD				Mohamed, Mohamed N.; Taylor, William D.			Relative contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon to limnetic zooplankton: A new cross-system approach	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We measured the C-13 signature of epilimiletic CO2, particulate organic carbon (POC), and zooplankton in 27 lakes in late summer, and used the relationships between the POC and zooplankton signatures and the CO2 signature to estimate the average autochthonous contribution to these fractions of the plankton and the average photosynthetic fractionation. Using this novel approach, average autochthonous contribution to epilimnetic POC was between 62 and 75%. Epilimnetic zooplankton were between 77 and 91% autochthonous, indicating that zooplankton bias their feeding towards the autochthonous fraction of POC. On average, zooplankton were 1.2 parts per thousand enriched in C-13 relative to POC, but their biased feeding on phytoplankton means that they can be depleted relative to POC in lakes where POC is highly depleted in C-13. The relationship between C-13-POC and (CO2)-C-13 allowed us to estimate average photosynthetic fraction as -15.9 parts per thousand. This estimate is independent of how much allochthonous C contributes to POC. Given the strength of the relationships between C-13 of POC or zooplankton with (CO2)-C-13 signature, we infer that variation in photosynthetic fractionation was not a major contributor to differences among lakes in POC and zooplankton C-13 signature. Allochthonous C is an important, although clearly secondary, source of C to zooplankton of these lakes in late summer.

Spectral characteristics, dynamics, and relationships with optically active constituents and common optical metrics, are documented for three light absorbing components in culturally eutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York, U. S. A., based on the results of a 5 year study. The absorption coefficient, a(m(-1)), is partitioned according to the additive components of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)), non-algal particles (a(NAP)), phytoplankton (a(phi)), and water itself (a(w); known), based on laboratory measurements for near surface samples collected weekly for the spring to fall interval over the 2004-2008 period. Supporting bulk measurements included dissolved organic carbon, total suspended solids (TSS) and its organic and inorganic (FSS) fractions, the concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a ([Chl]), downwelling irradiance profiles to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm [c(660)], and Secchi disc depth. The average exponential slope values for a(CDOM) (0.0168 nm(-1)) and a(NAP) (0.0126 nm(-1)) were very similar to those reported for other case 2 systems. The shapes of a(phi) spectra, represented by the ratio a(phi)(440) : a(phi)(676), were found to negatively depend on [Chl]. The largest component of a at 440 nm, the reference wavelength, in each of the 5 years was a(CDOM) (similar to 45 to 60 %), the smallest was a(NAP) (similar to 15 to 25 %). Progressive decreases in yearly average a(phi), particularly over the last three years are documented in response to decreases in [Chl], driven by increased nutrient limitation and Daphnia grazing (2008 only). Wide short-term variations are demonstrated within years for the components of a, particularly in response to the timing of runoff and Daphnia grazing events. Strong positive relationships are reported between a(NAP) and both TSS and FSS, a(phi) (at both lambda = 440 and 676 nm) and [Chl], and a(p) (a(NAP) plus a(phi)) and both TSS and c(660). The summation of the absorbing components at 440 nm is demonstrated to be a strong predictor of K-d. The utility of the information in supporting a model for K-d and SD and advancing monitoring of water quality through measurements of surface reflectance is described.																			1863-9135					MAR	2010	176	3					209	223		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0209													WOS:000279768700003

Estimating groundwater inflow and leakage outflow for an intermontane lake with a structurally complex geology: Georgetown Lake in Montana, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Stable isotopes of the water molecule (delta O-18 and delta D) for groundwater, lake water, streams, and precipitation were coupled with physical flux measurements to investigate groundwater-lake interactions and to establish a water balance for a structurally complex lake. Georgetown Lake, a shallow high-latitude high-elevation lake, is located in southwestern Montana, USA. The lake is situated between two mountain ranges with highlands primarily to the east and south of the lake and a lower valley to the west. An annual water balance and (delta O-18 and delta D) isotope balance were used to quantify annual groundwater inflows of 2.5 x 10(7) m(3)/year and lake leakage outflows of 1.6 x 10(7) m(3)/year. Roughly, 57% of total inflow to the lake is from groundwater, and 37% of total outflow at Georgetown Lake is groundwater. Stable isotopes of groundwater and springs around the lake and surrounding region show that the east side of the lake contains meteoric water recharged annually from higher mountain sources, and groundwater discharge to the lake occurs through this region. However, springs located in the lower western valley and some of the surrounding domestic wells west of the lake show isotopic enrichment indicative of strong to moderate evaporation similar to Georgetown Lake water. This indicates that some outflowing lake water recharges groundwater through the underlying west-dipping bedrock in the region.

The joint effects of riverine, thermal, and wind forcing on a temperate fjord lake: Quesnel Lake, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Field data obtained in 2003-2004 are used to describe the influence of atmospheric and riverine forcing on the thermal history of fjord-type lakes using Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada as an example. Typical of fjord-type lakes, Quesnel Lake is narrow, long (>100km total thalweg), multi-armed (three arms of comparable size), deep (maximum depth>500m), and has multiple basins separated by sills. The lake's annual thermal history responds to the joint forcing of surface heat exchange, river inputs, and wind stress. The lake's annual heat budget is dominated by surface radiative fluxes, and riverine input of heat is insignificant in this medium residence time lake (10years). Despite being insignificant to the annual heat budget, the three major rivers that feed the three arms of the lake contribute to the overall lake circulation pattern. Since these rivers have differing salinities, it is possible to identify, using temperature/salinity correlation diagrams, patterns of riverine circulation interflowing in the lake. Data from a 1-year thermistor-chain record suggests exchange between surface and intermediate waters occurs twice annually, but deep-waters below 150-250m are mainly renewed during autumn, by strong and episodic atmospheric forcing. This is because wind-forced turbulent diffusion and gravitational convection triggered by wind forced displacement of isotherms (initiating thermobaric instability) are required for full overturn and deep-water renewal.

J	Lambert, T; Perga, ME				Lambert, Thibault; Perga, Marie-Elodie			Non-conservative patterns of dissolved organic matter degradation when and where lake water mixes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In this study, we experimentally investigated the degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during lateral and vertical mixing of different water masses in a peri-alpine lake. River intrusions and vertical winter turnover in Lake Geneva (Switzerland, France) were simulated through short-term laboratory incubations by mixing riverine and lacustrine waters or lacustrine waters collected at different depths in winter. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) degradation was monitored by dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements and changes in DOM composition were tracked by fluorescence spectroscopy in pure and mixed treatments during 72h. Initial DOC content and DOM composition were relatively similar between end-members. The amount of DOC respired at the end of the incubation was similar between treatments, but decay constants in mixed treatments derived from a first-order decay model were significantly higher than expected values calculated based on a simple mass balance model. Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in mixed treatments followed non-conservative patterns that could not be predicted based on observations made in pure treatments. Hence, one protein-like and one microbial-like fluorophore that were consumed in lake waters were continuously produced in mixed treatments although lake waters represented 90% of the mix. No relationships were observed between the rate of DOC consumption and the initial DOM composition, suggesting that other factors such as nutrients and/or interactions in microbial communities were involved. Moreover, no relationships were found between DOC and FDOM patterns during incubations, suggesting that these measurements targeted different facets of microbial metabolism of DOM, respectively microbial respiration (catabolism) and microbial production (anabolism). While additional investigations are required in order to identify the drivers of these changes, this study provides evidence of non-conservative behavior of DOM degradation in mixing zones in lakes.					; Lambert, Thibault/M-7192-2017	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Lambert, Thibault/0000-0002-7666-5370													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2019	81	4							64	10.1007/s00027-019-0662-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0662-z													WOS:000477929300001
J	Kaeding, LR; Boltz, GD				Kaeding, LR; Boltz, GD			Use of remote-site incubators to produce arctic grayling fry of wild parentage	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Remote-site incubators (RSIs) adjacent to five streams were evaluated as part of a program to reestablish spawning stocks of Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus in Upper Red Rock Lake in southwest Montana. From 2000 to 2002, wild adult Arctic grayling were caught from the only study stream that currently supports natural spawning. Adults were artificially spawned, and the fertilized eggs were immediately placed into 12 RSIs in 2000, 8 in 2001, and 10 in 2002. Apart from daily removal of dead eggs and dead fry, no prophylaxis was administered. Median numbers of accumulated degree-days (and calendar days) to first observation of eye-up, hatch, and swim-up were 106.1 (10.5), 139.2 (14.0), and 169.2 (17.5), respectively. Mean (+/-95% confidence interval) percent emergence was greater in 2000 (73.4 +/- 15.1%) than in 2001 and 2002 (pooled mean, 26.5 +/- 11.9%). Mean percent emergence at a warm (similar to13degreesC) site (East Elk Springs Creek; 69.8 +/- 22.0%) was higher than the pooled mean for the other four sites (35.3 +/- 15.0%). In 2002, Arctic grayling were observed spawning in the main-stem Elk Springs Creek downstream from two RSI sites on tributaries; the species was last reported in this creek in the late 1960s. We believe that the fish observed spawning in 2002 emerged from the RSIs during 2000. Remote-site incubators are useful, cost-effective tools that could help reestablish Arctic grayling spawning stocks.

Variations in sediment composition can be assessed directly from fresh sediment surfaces at ultra-high-resolution (40-300 mu m measurement resolution) based on spectral profiles of light reflected from sediments in visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared wavelengths (400-2500 nm). Here, we review recent methodological developments in this new and growing field of research, as well as applications of this technique for paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental studies. Hyperspectral imaging of sediment cores has been demonstrated to effectively track variations in sedimentary pigments, organic matter, grain size, minerogenic components, and other sedimentary features. These biogeochemical variables record information about past climatic conditions, paleoproductivity, past hypolimnetic anoxia, aeolian input, volcanic eruptions, earthquake and flood frequencies, and other variables of environmental relevance. HSI has been applied to study seasonal and inter-annual environmental variability as recorded in individual varves (annually laminated sediments) or to study sedimentary records covering long glacial-interglacial time-scales (>10,000 years).

The area of the survey and the acquisition parameters need to be optimized and constrained to match the narrow time frame. Seismic operations must follow environmental regulations to avoid adverse impacts to the wildlife and sensitive terrains, including lakes, rivers, abandoned meanders, and the flora able to grow in the region. No vehicles or seismic equipment is allowed to operate above them in winter regardless of their protection by the snow cover. Furthermore, only vehicles and machinery are allowed to work on the frozen tundra or over frozen lakes and rivers with grounded ice. However, the ice thickness in the frozen lakes and rivers is not capable of supporting the heavy seismic vibrator. Therefore, many source points must be relocated which finally results in irregular source point distribution over the survey acquisition area. The conventional method to recover source points around obstructions causes a concentrated redistribution of source points in the vicinity around the obstructions. An alternative operational method to recover source positions is presented in this paper. We used different types of geophysical analysis to evaluate the proposed optimized method for source recovery including traditional geophysical attribute analysis, illumination studies and attribute analysis of seismic data acquired in the Horse Shoe 3D project. The proposed method can be implemented in areas with significant surface obstructions, either due to environmental restrictions, population, industrial or oilfield areas, or natural obstructions, etc. An important conclusion is that the improvement in S/N and attributes obtained by the implementation of the proposed method for source recovery did require only a marginal increase in the work volume or resources for the project and so the cost and time of execution were not affected.

J	Nowlin, WH; Evarts, JL; Vanni, MJ				Nowlin, WH; Evarts, JL; Vanni, MJ			Release rates and potential fates of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments in a eutrophic reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Nutrients released from lake sediments can influence water column nutrient concentrations and planktonic productivity. We examined sediment nutrient release [soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonia (NH4+)] at two sites in a eutrophic reservoir 4 (Acton Lake, OH, U.S.A.) that differed in physical mixing conditions (a thermally stratified and an unstratified site). 2. Sediment nutrient release rates were estimated with three methods: sediment core incubations, seasonal in situ hypolimnetic accumulation and a published regression model that predicted sediment phosphorous (P) release rate from sediment P concentration. All three methods were applied to the deeper stratified site in the reservoir; however, we used only sediment core incubations to estimate SRP and NH4+ release rates at the shallow 4 unstratified site because of the lack of thermal stratification. We also compared the total P concentration (TPS) of sediments and the concentration of P in various sediment fractions at both sites. 3. Anoxic sediments at the stratified site released SRP at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than oxic sediments at the shallow unstratified site. However, P accumulated in the hypolimnion at much lower rates than predicted by sediment core incubations. In contrast, NH4+ was released at similar rates at both sites and accumulated in 4 the hypolimnion at close to the expected rate, indicating that P was 'lost' from the hypolimnion through biogeochemical pathways for P, such as precipitation with inorganic material or biological uptake and sedimentation. 4. TPs was significantly greater at the deeper stratified site and organically bound P accounted for > 50 % of TPS at both sites. 5. We examined the magnitude of SRP fluxes into the study reservoir in 1996 by comparing the mean summer daily SRP fluxes from anaerobic sediments, aerobic sediments, stream inflows and gizzard shad excretion. While the SRP release from anaerobic sediments was high, we hypothesise that little of this SRP gained access to the epilimnion in mid-summer. SRP flux to the reservoir from aerobic sediments was less than from gizzard shad excretion and streams. Large interannual variability in thermocline stability, gizzard shad biomass and stream discharge volumes, will affect SRP loading rates from different sources in different years. Therefore, construction of P budgets for different years should account for interannual variation in these parameters.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2005	50	2					301	322		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01316.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01316.x													WOS:000226930700008

Fate of turbid glacial inflows in a hydroelectric reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Turbidity from glacial meltwater limits light penetration with potential ecological consequences. Using profiles of temperature, conductivity, and turbidity, we examine the physical processes driving changes in the epilimnetic turbidity of Carpenter Reservoir, a long and narrow, glacier-fed reservoir in southwest British Columbia, Canada. Following the onset of permanent summer stratification, the relatively dense inflows plunged into the hypolimnion, and despite the high glacial load entering the reservoir, the epilimnion cleared due to particle settling. Using a one-dimensional (longitudinal) diffusion equation for a decaying substance to describe the variation in epilimnetic turbidity, we obtain two nondimensional parameters: the epilimnetic inflow parameter, I, a measure of the turbidity flux into the epilimnion; and the dispersion parameter, D, a measure of longitudinal dispersion. In the case of Carpenter Reservoir: I << 1, indicating that turbidity declines over the summer; and D << 1, indicating a strong gradient in turbidity along the epilimnion. Using our theoretical formulation of epilimnetic turbidity variations in conjunction with monthly field surveys, we compute the particle settling velocity (similar to 0.25md(-1)), the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (50-70 m(2) s(-1)), and the flux of turbid water into the epilimnion (similar to 1% of the total inflow). Our approach is applicable to other reservoirs and can be used to investigate changes in turbidity in response to changes in I and D.					; Lawrence, Gregory/C-4798-2014; Robb, Daniel/LUZ-2881-2024	Robb, Daniel/0000-0001-7787-0918; Lawrence, Gregory/0000-0002-1011-8227; Pieters, Roger/0000-0003-3618-2902; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				DEC	2021	21	6					1201	1225		10.1007/s10652-021-09815-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-021-09815-4		SEP 2021						34966250					WOS:000699006000001

RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Tilapia zilli and Solea vulgaris live fish were collected from Lake Qarun, El Fayoum governorate, during mass mortality at summer season. The main clinical sings of infected fish were slimy dark skin with signs of asphyxia, presence of hemorrhagic lesions on the skin, fins, and gills. Investigation of T. zilli fish revealed that either bilateral and/or unilateral infection of their gill chambers with one species of Cymothoidae identified as Nerocila orbignyi. Bacterial isolation identified that 100% of examined fishes were found to be infected with either one type or mixed bacteria. V. alginolyticus was the most common bacteria isolated, followed by A. sobria, then Staph aureus. The results of water analysis showed increase in concentration trace elements especially iron 2.7 mg/l. Therefore, the present investigation was conducted to shed light on multifactorial causes of mass mortalities among fishes in the Lake.					; Younes, Abdelgayed/HNS-7296-2023; Abdel-Latif M, Ahmed/K-1479-2015	Younes, Abdelgayed/0000-0003-2033-9653; 													0975-8585					MAR-APR	2016	7	2					1906	1911																WOS:000410566700144

During 1985-87, research documented grizzly bears fishing on 61% of the 124 tributary streams to the lake. Using track measurements, it was estimated that a minimum of 44 grizzly bears fished those streams annually. During 1994, non-native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) were discovered in Yellowstone Lake. Lake trout are efficient predators and have the potential to reduce the native cutthroat population and negatively impact terrestrial predators that use cutthroat trout as a food resource. In 1997, we began sampling a subset of streams (n = 25) from areas of Yellowstone Lake surveyed during the previous study to determine if changes in spawner numbers or bear use had occurred. Comparisons of peak numbers and duration suggested a considerable decline between study periods in streams in the West Thumb area of the lake. The apparent decline may be due to predation by lake trout. Indices of bear use also declined on West Thumb area streams. We used DNA from hair collected near spawning streams to estimate the minimum number of bears visiting the vicinity of spawning streams. Seventy-four individual bears were identified from 429 hair samples. The annual number of individuals detected ranged from 15 in 1997 to 33 in 2000. Seventy percent of genotypes identified were represented by more than 1 sample, but only 31% of bears were documented more than 1 year of the study. Sixty-two (84%) bears were only documented in 1 segment of the lake, whereas 12 (16%) were found in 2-3 lake segments. Twenty-seven bears were identified from hair collected at multiple streams. One bear was identified on 6 streams in 2 segments of the lake and during 3 years of the study. We used encounter histories derived from DNA and the Jolly-Seber procedure in Program MARK to produce annual estimates of grizzly bears visiting streams. Approximately 68 grizzly bears visited the vicinity of cutthroat trout spawning streams annually. Thus, approximately 14-21% of grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) may have used this threatened food resource annually. Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is attempting to control the lake trout population in Yellowstone Lake; our results underscore the importance of that effort to grizzly bears.

ARCHIVES DES SCIENCES												The biomass of phytoplankton is always low, but its turnover rate is very high, as shown by primary productivity measurements. Nanophytoplanktons are easily grazed by zooplanktons and organic matter is transfered through the food chain. Larger phytoplanktons are generally not edible and organic matter is recycled by way of the microbial loop. In the seventies, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria blooms frequently occured, in conjunction with high total phosphorus concentrations. In the eighties and the early nineties, as total phosphorus concentration regularly decreased, microphytoplankton biomass fluctuated around lower values whereas nanophytoplankton became more important. But in 1995 and 1996, the strong development of filamentous algae in late summer indicated the unsteadiness of Lake Geneva and the need for reducing more phosphorus concentration.

Climate warming directly affects hydrological changes and may threaten water availability and ecological security in Xinjiang (XJ). In this study, we conducted a systematic review of recent climatic changes and their effects on hydrological system changes in XJ. The XJ climate has experienced significant warming and moistening during 1961-2018, and the most dramatic increase has occurred since the mid-1980s. Climate extremes have become increasingly notable in the warming climate, resulting in increases in precipitation and warm extremes and decreases in cold extremes. Moreover, accelerated local precipitation recycling has been triggered by an increasingly warm-wet climate and enhanced evaporation. The accelerated climate warming in XJ has caused significant glacier shrinkage, decreased snow cover and snowfall fraction, aggravated meteorological drought, increased river runoff, and lake expansion. The climate-related changes in the hydrological regimes may have adverse ecological effects, including increased soil moisture loss, reduced growing season vegetation growth, and shrinkage of the desert-oasis ecotone. Despite many achievements in climate and hydrological change research in XJ, we suggest that there is an urgent need to improve the comprehensive ground observation network, reproduce climate variability findings using multiple datasets, reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, and assess the hydro-meteorological disaster risks of a warming climate in the future.

Factors controlling temporal and spatial distribution of total mercury and methylmercury in hyporheic sediments of the Allequash Creek wetland, northern Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Hyporheic pore water samples were collected from two sites within the Allequash Creek wetland, in Vilas County, northern Wisconsin, from August 2003 to October 2004. Samples were collected simultaneously at the surface and at 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 cm below the sediment-water interface. Concentration ranges were 3.7 to 58 pM for inorganic mercury, < 0.5 to 16 pM for methylmercury, 3.02 to 152 mu M and 0.38 to 96.6 mu M for oxidized and reduced iron, respectively, 1.28 to 48.2 mu M and< 0.05 to 9.76 mu M for oxidized and reduced sulfur, respectively, and 109 to 689 mu M for dissolved organic carbon. These concentrations are typical of anoxic environments such as wetlands and lake sediments. These data were used to gain a better understanding of the processes controlling spatial and temporal variability of inorganic mercury and methylmercury. Findings show that conditions conducive to mercury methylation exist in the hyporheic zone, especially in late summer, when accumulation of reduced iron and sulfide are indicative of microbial iron and sulfate reduction. Methylmercury concentrations also peak in late summer, with the highest concentrations appearing 2 to 10 cm below the sediment-water interface. While there is a general covariance of total mercury and methylmercury over the depth profile, poor correlation was observed over time, highlighting the dynamic nature of hyporheic zone conditions and suggesting changes in mercury speciation and partitioning.

Pond methane dynamics, from microbial communities to ecosystem budget, during summer in Alaska	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Ponds play a larger role in the global freshwater methane (CH4) budget than predicted from surface area alone. To improve our understanding of pond CH4 dynamics, we measured summer CH4 production, concentrations, and emissions to the atmosphere in nine Alaskan wetland ponds along with potential physical, chemical, and biological regulators. Pond CH4 production (0.64, 0.086-1.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1); median, interquartile range), as assessed with slurry incubations, was positively related to water-column temperature and chlorophyll a (Chl a), negatively influenced by oxygen levels, and varied with microbial community structure. Average water-column CH4 concentrations (0.39, 0.21-0.87 mu mol L-1) were lower in deeper ponds and at higher oxygen levels, and as expected, they were correlated with diffusive emissions (0.055, 0.024-0.20 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) assessed with flux chambers. Based on a mass balance approach, 39-99% of CH4 produced in ponds was oxidized. Pond ebullition (3.7, 0.60-24 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was higher and more variable than diffusive emissions. Additionally, pond ebullition rates were better correlated with production rates from the previous month. We also systematically compared the ratio of ebullition to diffusive CH4 emissions in our ponds and other northern lakes, which was negatively related to water depth (n = 71), but positively related to Chl a (n = 28). Our study sheds light on the factors that influence pond CH4 dynamics and demonstrates that pond ebullition is a significant CH4 source worthy of continued study.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021	Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Vizza, Carmella/0000-0002-9269-0357													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2022	67	2					450	467		10.1002/lno.12003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12003		DEC 2021											WOS:000735908300001

Scott; Bailey, Christopher M.; Cerling, Thure E.; Bergman, Sarah			Timing of glaciation and last glacial maximum paleoclimate estimates from the Fish Lake Plateau, Utah	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The High Plateaus of Utah include seven separate mountain ranges that supported glaciers during the Pleistocene. The Fish Lake Plateau, located on the eastern edge of the High Plateaus, preserves evidence of at least two glacial advances. Four cosmogenic He-3 exposure ages of boulders in an older moraine range from 79 to 159 ka with a mean age of 129 +/- 39 ka and oldest ages of 152 +/- 3 and 159 +/- 5 ka. These ages suggest deposition during the type Bull Lake glaciation and Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 6. Twenty boulder exposure ages from four different younger moraines indicate a local last glacial maximum (LGM) of similar to 21.1 ka, coincident with the type Pinedale glaciation and MIS 2. Reconstructed Pinedale-age glaciers from the Fish Lake Plateau have equilibrium-line altitudes ranging from 2950 to 3190 m. LGM summer temperature depressions for the Fish Lake Plateau range from -10.7 to -8.2 degrees C, assuming no change in precipitation. Comparison of the Fish Lake summer temperature depressions to a regional dataset suggests that the Fish Lake Plateau may have had a slight increase (similar to 1.5x modern) in precipitation during the LGM. A series of submerged ridges in Fish Lake were identified during a bathymetric survey and are likely Bull Lake age moraines. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Use of a regional atmospheric model to simulate lake-atmosphere feedbacks associated with Pleistocene Lakes Lahontan and Bonneville	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												A regional model of the atmosphere (version 4 of the NCAR mesoscale model, MM4) was used to assess whether lake-effect precipitation was a significant component of the late-Pleistocene hydrologic budgets of Lakes Lahontan and Bonneville. Control simulations for January and July of 1979 were made using MM4, and the Pleistocene highstand surface areas of the lakes were added to the model and the simulations repeated. In the January simulations, 18% of the moisture added to the modeled atmosphere by Lake Lahontan returned to the Lahontan basin as precipitation, while 32% of the water evaporated from Lake Bonneville fell as precipitation over the Bonneville basin. In the July simulations, 7% of the moisture added to the modeled atmosphere by Lake Lahontan returned to the Lahontan basin as precipitation, and 4% of the water evaporated from Lake Bonneville fell as precipitation over the Bonneville basin. An additonal January simulation was made with the lake surface areas set at one-half their highstand extents (the average surface area 20 to 15 ka BP). Results from this simulation were similar to the simulation with the highstand lakes, indicating lake-effect precipitation could have been a significant component of the hyrologic budgets of the lakes before and during the highstand period.

A green sulfur bacterium from epsomitic Hot Lake, Washington, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Hot Lake is a small heliothermal and hypersaline lake in far north-central Washington State (USA) and is limnologically unusual because MgSO4 rather than NaCl is the dominant salt. In late summer, the Hot Lake metalimnion becomes distinctly green from blooms of planktonic phototrophs. In a study undertaken over 60 years ago, these blooms were predicted to include green sulfur bacteria, but no cultures were obtained. We sampled Hot Lake and established enrichment cultures for phototrophic sulfur bacteria in MgSO4-rich sulfidic media. Most enrichments turned green or red within 2 weeks, and from green-colored enrichments, pure cultures of a lobed green sulfur bacterium ( phylum Chlorobi) were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses showed the organism to be a species of the prosthecate green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris. Cultures of this Hot Lake phototroph were halophilic and tolerated high levels of sulfide and MgSO4. In addition, unlike all recognized species of Prosthecochloris, the Hot Lake isolates grew at temperatures up to 45 degrees C, indicating an adaptation to the warm summer temperatures of the lake. Photoautotrophy by Hot Lake green sulfur bacteria may contribute dissolved organic matter to anoxic zones of the lake, and their diazotrophic capacity may provide a key source of bioavailable nitrogen, as well.					; Lindemann, Steve/H-6979-2019	Sattley, W.

Although the general structure of the batholith is well known, its near-surface structure is less well known because of the overburden. Consequently, the precise locations of groundwater discharge from deep fractures into local surface water remain uncertain. Deep groundwater in the WRA is highly enriched with radiogenic He from the decay of natural U and Th ([He] is up to 50 mL.L-1). Surface waters normally equilibrate with atmospheric He and contain a standard [He] of 47 nL.L-1. We hypothesized that areas of deep groundwater discharge from the Lac du Bonnet batholith should be characterized by elevated aqueous He concentrations. We surveyed Boggy Creek and Boggy Lake at the WRA in the late winter of 1989 for such He anomalies. In Boggy Creek, three significant anomalies were identified, whereas in Boggy Lake several were found, the largest occupying the southeast quarter of the 80 ha lake. All the He anomalies were closely associated with the mapped or projected locations of faults in the underlying granite. A calculation of the total mass of excess He trapped under winter ice in Boggy Lake suggests that the total volume of deep groundwater seepage is small.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				DEC	1992	29	12					2640	2652		10.1139/e92-209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e92-209													WOS:A1992KX29000012

Fifty-five major semivolatile and nonvolatile pollutants including C14-C26 alkanes, PAHs ranging from acenaphthylene (M = 152) to those with M = 252, phenols, and methoxylated phenols were efficiently collected on the filter and PUF sorbent sheets and were quantitated in the unfractionated extracts using GC/MS. In 22 samples collected at six different locations m Minneapolis, MN, and Salt Lake City, UT, the average weight percent contributions of each compound class measured were as follows: n-alkanes, 23%; PAHs 11%; methoxyphenols, 21%; and phenols, 45%. Methoxylated phenol concentrations were highest in residential areas with high wood burning, alkanes were highest in high traffic areas, and phenols and PAHs were associated with all types of sampling locations. Guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and its major derivatives showed excellent correlations (r2 ca. 0.74-0.90) with the fraction of "new" (wood smoke-derived) PM-10 carbon determined by C-14 analysis, demonstrating that their measurement could be used to determine the fraction of PM-10 particulate carbon contributed by residential wood burning.																			0013-936X					NOV	1992	26	11					2251	2262		10.1021/es00035a026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00035a026													WOS:A1992JV98900032
J	Meissner, W				Meissner, Wlodzimierz			Seasonal and Long-Term Changes in the Number of Waterfowl Wintering on Lake Żarnowieckie, Northern Poland	WATER												Lake & Zdot;arnowieckie, one of the largest lakes in northern Poland, hosts a high number of waterfowl during the non-breeding season. This study presents data on bird abundance from two periods. From 1986 to 1990, coinciding with the early colonization of the lake by zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha, counts were conducted monthly between October and April. From 2011 to 2025, only one count was performed in January. Between 1986 and 1990, the highest numbers of waterfowl were observed in November and December, with maximum counts exceeding 20,000 birds. Three most abundant species-Eurasian coot Fulica atra, tufted duck Aythya fuligula, and mallard Anas platyrhynchos-accounted for 95-98% of all waterfowl. In January, their numbers significantly decreased, remaining low in the following months. This sharp decline mainly affected diving benthivores (tufted duck and Eurasian coot), which exerted strong pressure on prey populations, leading to a rapid decrease in their numbers and forcing a shift in foraging sites. The greatest decrease occurred in seasons with the highest number of waterfowl in December, when diving benthivores were most abundant and applied the greatest pressure on benthic organisms. These seasonal changes suggest that a single January count may not fully represent the significance of the lake for waterfowl. Over the study period, both ichthyophages, the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus, showed substantial increases in number. For cormorants, this growth coincided with the increase in the European population, while the rise in great crested grebes likely exemplifies the establishment of a new wintering site for this species in a location rich in food and free from intense human disturbance.																				2073-4441				APR 18	2025	17	8							1209	10.3390/w17081209	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17081209													WOS:001477294100001
J	Winemiller, KO; Anderson, AA				Winemiller, KO; Anderson, AA			Response of endangered desert fish populations to a constructed refuge	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation created a shallow, 110-m channel to provide habitat for two endangered fishes, Cyprinodon elegans (Comanche Springs pupfish) and Gambusia nobilis (Pecos gambusia), at the site of the fishes' former natural habitat. The cienega (marsh) associated with Phantom Lake Spring in Jeff Davis County, Texas, was destroyed by the creation of an irrigation canal system. In 1993, the endangered fishes were stocked into the refuge with individuals from the irrigation canals, and in the case of C. elegans, hatchery stocks. The condition of habitat, status of fish populations, and fish ecology within the refuge were then monitored for two years. The abundance and density of both species increased in accordance with aquatic plant development. Cyprinodon elegans abundance peaked after one year and stabilized at an average density of 14.7/m(2) by the end of our study. Juvenile C. elegans were always rare, which may indicate that the population reached the refuge's carrying capacity and that recruitment is low. Gambusia nobilis was the most abundant fish in the refuge (average density 96/m(2)), used the entire refuge, and outcompeted nonindigenous G. geiseri. The two Gambusia species used similar habitats but showed almost no dietary overlap. High densities of aquatic plants reduced the amount of open water areas necessary for C. elegans. The refuge will sustain the two endangered fishes at this historic site of endemism while maintaining flow to the irrigation system; however, the refuge is not equivalent to a restored cienega.

J	Lisi, PJ; Schindler, DE				Lisi, Peter J.; Schindler, Daniel E.			Wind-driven upwelling in lakes destabilizes thermal regimes of downstream rivers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Natural lakes are generally assumed to stabilize thermal regimes of downstream rivers. This conceptual model does not account for the potential destabilizing effects that wind has on the surface temperatures of thermally stratified lakes and, therefore, on thermal regimes of outflowing rivers. We examined the thermal variation in streams and rivers from 24 watersheds without lakes and 15 draining lakes that varied in surface area (0.3-101 km(2)) and thus, their potential exposure to wind. Rivers draining large lakes (> 10 km(2) surface area) had summer thermal regimes with 1.8 times more variation (expressed as the coefficient of variation) than both rivers draining smaller lakes and watersheds lacking lakes. Statistical decomposition of thermal regimes revealed that approximate to 3% (range: 1-5%) of the thermal variability in rivers below large lakes was from diel-scale variation, compared to 31% (14-48%) in streams lacking lakes and 24% (6-34%) in those draining smaller lakes. Instead, rivers downstream of large lakes had distinct summer thermal regimes characterized by abrupt cooling events involving drops in temperature of 5-10 degrees C that lasted 1-3 d. These events were generally synchronous across space and not observed in watersheds without lakes or in watersheds draining small lakes. Cooling events in rivers were coordinated with high velocity winds that passed thresholds for upwelling of cool hypolimnetic water to lake outlets. Wind driven upwelling may be a common source of thermal variation in rivers draining large stratified lakes and reservoirs, making them more thermally variable than previously appreciated. The ecological responses to this thermal instability remain unexplored.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2015	60	1					169	180		10.1002/lno.10010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10010													WOS:000349082600015

In this study, we present paleoenvironment data from the lacustrine-aeolian deposit sections and a lake sediment core from the Lake Wulanhushao basin, southern Inner Mongolia. Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating and elevation measurements on the outcrop sections provide an estimation of lake-level changes for the past 10.1 kyr. For the sediment core, multi-proxy analyses of pollen, grain size, loss-on-ignition, element, and chroma were undertaken. The pollen result indicates a tendency of moisture increase from 10.6 to 9.1 cal kyr B.P., providing moderate conditions for the gradual expansion of trees in the mountains. The highest moisture availability was reached from 9.1 to 5.6 cal kyr B.P. leading to the maximal arboreal extent. After then, aridification in the region was evidenced by the declined trees and the increase of desert components. Comparing with the pollen result, non-pollen proxies from the lake sediment core and the outcrop sections indicate a slightly different climate pattern. That is, the initiation of Holocene climate optimum in the lake catchment, suggested by a high lake level, increased biological production, and an enhanced chemical weathering occurred about 1.5 kyr earlier than the arboreal expansion in the distal mountains. While the climate patterns were more or less consistent as inferred from the lacustrine pollen records at the East Asian Summer Monsoon margin, catchment-specific responses to regional climate variations might explain this perplexing discrepancy between pollen and non-pollen proxies. Our study emphasizes the importance of multi-proxy analyses from various perspectives when investigating the local and regional responses to Holocene climate variations.

A sediment core from Lake El'gygytgyn in northeastern (NE) Russia provides a continuous, high-resolution record from the Arctic, spanning the past 2.8 million years. This core reveals numerous "super interglacials" during the Quaternary; for marine benthic isotope stages (MIS) 11c and 31, maximum summer temperatures and annual precipitation values are similar to 4 degrees to 5 degrees C and similar to 300 millimeters higher than those of MIS 1 and 5e. Climate simulations show that these extreme warm conditions are difficult to explain with greenhouse gas and astronomical forcing alone, implying the importance of amplifying feedbacks and far field influences. The timing of Arctic warming relative to West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreats implies strong interhemispheric climate connectivity.					; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Andreev, Andrei/J-2701-2015; Wennrich, Volker/I-3435-2012; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012	Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Andreev, Andrei/0000-0002-8745-9636; Wennrich, Volker/0000-0003-3617-1963; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Cook, Timothy/0000-0002-4982-6415													0036-8075	1095-9203				JUL 20	2012	337	6092					315	320		10.1126/science.1222135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1222135								22722254					WOS:000306542600044

Snow Deposition and Melting as Drivers of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Organochlorine Pesticides in Arctic Rivers, Lakes, and Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concurrent sampling of freshwater (lakes and rivers), seawater, snow, air, and zooplankton for a range of legacy polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) was undertaken in the Canadian High Arctic during ice-covered, melting, and ice-free conditions. Overall, there was a general trend of higher fluvial PCB/OCP concentrations associated with the spring snow melt (early-mid June), while much lower concentrations were detected during the snow-free season (end of July). In contrast, PCB concentrations in two Arctic lakes (West and East Lakes, Melville Island) and in ocean waters, sharply increased in the ice-free period, likely because of inputs from the ice/snow layer melting and river runoff. The resulting air-water fugacity ratios and fluxes followed a remarkable shift during the sampling campaign. PCBs and OCPs shifted from equilibrium during ice/snow-covered conditions toward a clear net volatilization of PCBs and most of the OCPs during snow/ice-free conditions. Differences in the bioaccumulation factor for PCB/OCPs in zooplankton between West and East Lakes were observed, likely because of zooplankton being exposed to more contaminated food in West Lake due to higher turbidity related to in-lake disturbances.

The family is based on a new species and genus, Crymostygius thingvallensis, found in spring inlets feeding Lake Thingvallavatn, south-west Iceland. This is the first report of a stygobiont freshwater amphipod from Iceland and the northern-most report of a stygobiont species in Europe. The species apparently survived Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations in the groundwater of a porous lava and may have persisted in Iceland for several million years.					; Kristjánsson, Bjarni/B-4349-2013	Svavarsson, Jorundur/0000-0003-1842-7515; Kristjansson, Bjarni K./0000-0001-6984-5771; 													0022-2933	1464-5262				AUG	2004	38	15					1881	1894		10.1080/00222930310001597295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930310001597295													WOS:000221522600002
J	HUTCHINSON, GE; COWGILL, UM				HUTCHINSON, GE; COWGILL, UM			CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF A CORE FROM LAKE ZERIBAR, IRAN	SCIENCE												Chemical studies indicate that during the first half of the history of Lake Zeribar, since about 14,800 years ago, the outlet ran very intermittently, thus resulting in a carbonate deposition and a moderate chloride content of the water. The later sediments are largely littoral and cannot easily be interpreted. A fall in exchangeable potassium at the top is probably correlated with the development of extensive beds of aquatic macrophytes. The data appear to be in harmony with those derived from pollen analysis.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1963	140	356					67	+		10.1126/science.140.3562.67	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.140.3562.67								17746008					WOS:A19633048C00112

Declines in freshwater mussel density, size and productivity in the River Thames over the past half century	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												A pioneering, quantitative study published in Journal of Animal Ecology in 1966 on freshwater mussel populations in the River Thames, UK, continues to be cited extensively as evidence of the major contribution that mussels make to benthic biomass and ecosystem functioning in global river ecosystems. Ecological alteration, as well as declines in freshwater mussel populations elsewhere, suggest that changes to mussel populations in the River Thames are likely to have occurred over the half century since this study. We resurveyed the site reported in Negus (1966) and quantified the changes in mussel population density, species composition, growth patterns and productivity. We found large declines in population density for all unionid species. The duck mussel Anodonta anatina decreased to 1.1% of 1964 density. The painter's mussel Unio pictorum fell to 3.2% of 1964 density. The swollen river mussel Unio tumidus showed statistically nonsignificant declines. In contrast to 1964, in 2020 we found no living specimens of the depressed river mussel Pseudanodonta complanata (classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List) but found new records of the invasive, nonnative zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. Additionally, we found strong decreases in size-at-age for all species, which now grow to 65-90% of maximum lengths in 1964. As a result of reduced density and size, estimated annual biomass production fell to 7.5% of 1964 levels. Since mussels can be important to ecosystem functioning, providing key regulating and provisioning services, the declines we found imply substantial degradation of freshwater ecosystem services in the River Thames, one of the UK's largest rivers. Our study also highlights the importance to conservationists and ecologists of updating and validating assumptions and data about wild populations, which in the present era of anthropogenic ecosystem alteration are undergoing significant and rapid changes. Regular population surveys of key species are essential to maintain an accurate picture of ecosystem health and to guide management.					; Ollard, Isobel/HJI-6890-2023	Ollard, Isobel/0000-0002-5807-055X; Aldridge, David/0000-0001-9067-8592													0021-8790	1365-2656				JAN	2023	92	1					112	123		10.1111/1365-2656.13835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13835		NOV 2022						36437493					WOS:000891060900001

The paper presents the analysis of the effect of teleconnection patterns (NAO, SCAND, EA, EAWR) on ice conditions in lakes in North Poland, determining the relations between the teleconnection conditions in the cold half-year and selected features of the ice regime, i.e. dates of ice start and ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness. Deviations of values of the aforementioned parameters in positive and negative phases of the considered teleconnection patterns were calculated in reference to mean values from the years 1956-2014. Two of them were determined to have considerable effect on the parameters of the ice regime, namely NAO, modifying ice start and ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness in the season, and SCAND, considerably changing ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness. The EA teleconnection pattern only affects ice end, and EAWR shows no correlations with the analysed ice parameters in lakes.					; Bednorz, Ewa/K-2801-2017; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Tomczyk, Arkadiusz/ABB-7117-2021	Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447; Bednorz, Ewa/0000-0002-5156-5568; Tomczyk, Arkadiusz Marek/0000-0003-1576-8795; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				NOV	2019	138	3-4					1961	1969		10.1007/s00704-019-02929-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02929-2													WOS:000494710000051

Stalagmite records of hydroclimate in central California during termination 1	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The last deglaciation is marked by large and abrupt hydroclimatic changes in the Great Basin and the American Southwest. However, comparatively little is known about how hydroclimate varied on the western side of the Sierra Nevada. We present new evidence for abrupt changes in precipitation amount in the central Sierra Nevada during the last deglaciation. Our new record from McLean's Cave overlaps with a previously published record from nearby Moaning Cave (Oster et al., 2009), and extends the record of hydroclimatic change in the region through Heinrich Stadial 1. McLean's Cave speleothem delta O-18, delta C-13, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca indicate a shift to drier conditions at the beginning of Heinrich Stadial 1 from 16.1 to 17.5 ka followed by wetter conditions at the end of Heinrich Stadial 1 when the majority of Great Basin lakes reached their deglacial highstands. During the last deglaciation, coincident shifts in the Moaning and McLean's Cave proxy records indicate drier conditions in the western Sierra Nevada during millennial-scale intervals of warming at high latitudes such as the Balling and Allerod, and wetter conditions during cooler intervals such as the Older and Younger Dryas. Thus, the Sierra Nevada speleothem records are consistent with other regional records that document increased winter rainfall during millennial-scale cold periods of the last deglaciation. However, regional differences exist in the hydroclimatic response to the Younger Dryas, with central Californian and interior southwestern sites indicating an increase in winter storms that is not apparent in southern California. Dynamic simulations of atmospheric circulation indicate that wetter conditions during the Younger Dryas relative to the Bolling at McLean's Cave may have resulted from a stronger storm track in the north Pacific at the latitude of northern California.

J	Sendrowski, A; Passalacqua, P				Sendrowski, Alicia; Passalacqua, Paola			Process connectivity in a naturally prograding river delta	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												River deltas are lowland systems that can display high hydrological connectivity. This connectivity can be structural (morphological connections), functional (control of fluxes), and process connectivity (information flow from system drivers to sinks). In this work, we quantify hydrological process connectivity in Wax Lake Delta, coastal Louisiana, by analyzing couplings among external drivers (discharge, tides, and wind) and water levels recorded at five islands and one channel over summer 2014. We quantify process connections with information theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the communication of information. We represent process connections as a network; variables serve as network nodes and couplings as network links describing the strength, direction, and time scale of information flow. Comparing process connections at long (105 days) and short (10 days) time scales, we show that tides exhibit daily synchronization with water level, with decreasing strength from downstream to upstream, and that tides transfer information as tides transition from spring to neap. Discharge synchronizes with water level and the time scale of its information transfer compares well to physical travel times through the system, computed with a hydrodynamic model. Information transfer and physical transport show similar spatial patterns, although information transfer time scales are larger than physical travel times. Wind events associated with water level setup lead to increased process connectivity with highly variable information transfer time scales. We discuss the information theory results in the context of the hydrologic behavior of the delta, the role of vegetation as a connector/disconnector on islands, and the applicability of process networks as tools for delta modeling results. Plain Language Summary Connectivity is an increasingly important concept in studying the complexity and evolution of landscapes. One aspect of connectivity often overlooked is process connectivity; the interaction between external drivers and system variables such as water level and sediment concentration. A better understanding of deltaic process connectivity would benefit numerical modelers in improving delta simulations. In this work, we apply information theory to directly quantify for the first time the connectivity between discharge, wind, and tides, and water level at five deltaic islands and one channel in Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a prograding delta in coastal Louisiana that is often cast as an analog of a river diversion system. The importance of deltaic islands as areas of increased biogeochemical processing make this analysis particularly relevant to better understand the hydrologic controls on islands. Our results highlight the multi-scale interactions between external drivers and deltaic water level. The role of wind events, tidal regime, and vegetation controls in process connectivity indicate the dynamic nature of deltaic systems. Couplings are characterized in terms of strength, direction, significance, and scale. Process connectivity is visualized as a process network; variables are network nodes and couplings are network links that depict significant information flow.

Distribution of economically important fish larvae (Characiformes, Prochilodontidae) in the Central Amazonia, Brazil	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The spatio-temporal patterns of three species of Prochilodontidae larvae that are intensely used as fishery resources in Central Amazonia are analysed. Sampling was conducted during 2011 at four stages of the hydrological cycle (flood, high water, falling and low water phases). Sixteen collecting stations were located in different habitats (mouths of lake channels, "barrancos," sandbars and the main river channel) along the Solimoes and Japura rivers. A total of 4,322 Prochilodontidae larvae were collected during this investigation, with most captures occurring in the Japura River (76.3% of larvae), while only 23.7% of the samples were caught in the Solimoes River. Most captures occurred during rising water, indicating a strong reproductive seasonality in these three species. Rainfall and water level, along with dissolved oxygen, water temperature and electric conductivity, determined the larvae's spatio-temporal distribution. These results confirm the importance of varzea areas along white water rivers for the conservation, preservation and maintenance of heavily used fishery resources in the Brazilian Central Amazonia.

Constraining the thermal history of the North American Midcontinent Rift System using carbonate clumped isotopes and organic thermal maturity indices	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The Midcontinent Rift System (MRS) is a Late Mesoproterozoic (similar to 1.1 Ga) sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks exposed in the Lake Superior Region of North America. The MRS continues to be the focus of much research due to its economic mineral deposits as well as its archive of Precambrian life and tectonic processes. In order to constrain the post-depositional thermal history of the MRS, samples were analyzed for carbonate clumped isotope composition and organic thermal maturity. Clumped isotope values from sedimentary/early-diagenetic samples were partially reset during burial to temperatures between 68 and 75 degrees C. Solid-state reordering models indicate that maximum burial temperatures of 125-155 degrees C would reset the clumped isotope values to the observed temperature range prior to the onset of regional cooling and uplift. Clumped isotope results from late-stage veins in the White Pine Mine encompass a greater temperature range (49-116 degrees C), indicative of spatially variable hydrothermal activity and vein emplacement after burial temperatures fell below 100 degrees C during regional cooling and uplift. Clumped isotope and organic thermal maturity data do not indicate significant spatial differences in thermal history along the MRS. Observed variability in bulk organic matter composition and biomarker indices are therefore more likely a result of shifts in primary productivity or early-degradation processes. These results demonstrate that the MRS experienced a spatially consistent, relatively mild thermal history (125-155 degrees C) and is therefore a valuable archive for understanding the Late Mesoproterozoic environment.

J	Wang, HJ; Cao, L; Feng, R				Wang, Huaijun; Cao, Lei; Feng, Ru			Hydrological Similarity-Based Parameter Regionalization under Different Climate and Underlying Surfaces in Ungauged Basins	WATER												Hydrological similarity-based parameter regionalization is the dominant method used for runoff prediction in ungauged basin. However, the application of this approach depends on assessing hydrological similarity between basins. This study used data for runoff, climate, and the underlying surface of the Hulan River Basin and Poyang Lake Basin to construct a novel physical hydrological similarity index (HSI). The index was used to compare the efficiency of transfer of the parameters of commonly used regionalization methods and to finally apply parameters to ungauged basins. The results showed that: (1) Precipitation is the main climatic factor regulating magnitude of runoff in the Poyang Lake Basin. Spring runoff in Hulan River Basin was regulated by precipitation and temperature. (2) The GR4J and CemaNeigeGR4J models achieved reasonable simulations of runoff of Poyang Lake Basin and Hulan River Basin. Although CemaNeigeGR4J considers snowmelt, the model simulations of spring runoff in the Hulan River Basin were not accurate. (3) There was a significant correlation between climate, the underlying surface, and hydrological model parameters. There were fewer significant correlations between environmental factors and between environmental factors and hydrological model parameters in the Hulan River Basin compared to those in the Poyang Lake Basin, possibly due to less sub-basins in the Hulan River Basin. (4) The HSI based on a combination of principal component analysis and the entropy method efficiently identified the most similar gauged basin for an ungauged basin. A significant positive correlation existed between the HSI and parameter transfer efficiency. The relationship between the HSI and transfer efficiency could be represented by logistic regression and linear regression in the Poyang Lake Basin and Hulan River Basin, respectively. The HSI was better able to quantify the hydrological similarity between basins in terms of climate and underlying surface and can provide a scientific reference for the transfer of hydrological model parameters in an ungauged basin.

J	EVANS, MS				EVANS, MS			HISTORIC CHANGES IN LAKE-MICHIGAN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE - THE 1960S REVISITED WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR TOP-DOWN CONTROL	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Recent changes in the Lake Michigan ecosystem provide a benchmark against which to reevaluate historic data. During the 1960s, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) population exploded and then crashed. Offshore zooplankton data for the summers of 1954, 1966, and 1968 provided evidence that variations in alewife abundance had a major effect on zooplankton community structure. Based on these observations, other researchers have hypothesized that increased and decreased phytoplankton abundances during the 1960s as recorded at the Chicago water filtration plant were due to top-down effects rather than to phosphorus loading. This argument is reevaluated using two approaches. First, from the relationship between interannual variability in alewife and zooplankton species abundance during the summers of 1954, 1966,1968,1977,1982, and 1984-87, I conclude that the effects of alewife predation on zooplankton community structure during the 1960s are less clear then originally proposed. Second, from estimates of Daphnia spp. grazing rates, considerations of the source of the long-term phytoplankton data used to support the top-down argument, regional differences in phytoplankton, zooplankton and alewife abundance trends, and historic water clarity observations, I conclude that existing data are insufficient to support the top-down argument that long-term trends in phytoplankton abundance were primarily affected by fluctuations in alewife abundance.																			0706-652X					AUG	1992	49	8					1734	1749		10.1139/f92-192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-192													WOS:A1992JP08800024

Microcystin concentrations can be predicted with phytoplankton biomass and watershed morphology	INLAND WATERS												Anthropogenically derived increases in nutrient loads and climate change are considered the primary drivers of harmful cyanobacterial bloom expansion in freshwaters; however, watershed and within lake physical variables, as well as community interactions, mediate the response of the phytoplankton community. Thus, predicting when cyanobacteria are abundant and when their toxins have elevated concentrations is potentially dependent on a large suite of variables. We used a large spatial and temporal scale study to identify the best environmental predictors of microcystin concentrations in lakes and reservoirs in Ohio (Midwest USA). Additionally, we explored predictive models for a censored dataset that included phytoplankton community composition and abiotic characteristics of lakes and their watersheds. We found that lakes had elevated microcystin concentrations when phytoplankton biomass was high and when lakes had small watershed areas relative to lake surface areas, and that biovolume of potential toxin producers and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) both predicted microcystin concentrations. Seasonal patterns in microcystin concentrations suggested that a single annual sampling may miss microcystin maxima and, contrary to expectations, a late summer maximum in microcystin was not universal.

All of the sediment samples were unpolluted or slightly polluted with geoaccumulation indexes (I-geo) of <1 and contamination factors (CF) of <2. In the sub-surface sediment (depth >20 cm), all of the heavy metals were controlled by groundwater, and the distributions of the concentrations, enrichments, and pollution indexes were closely associated with springs. The surface sediment at a depth of <10 cm, however, was contaminated by human activities, which significantly increased the I-geo, CF, and enrichment factors covering most of the lake. All elements exhibit accumulations near the mouth of the Yangzong River, suggesting that the pollution predominantly came from the river. In addition, Hg/Cd and As/Pb also exhibit increased enrichments near the thermal plant and the springs, respectively. Combined with multi-statistical analyses, it is suggested that Hg and Cd were mainly polluted by the river and the thermal plant in the surface sediment, while As and Pb were contributed by the river and groundwater. Co, Ni, and Zn were strongly associated with Fe and mainly originated from lithogeochemical processes, although their occurrence was affected by the groundwater in the sub-surface sediment and the river in the surface sediment. This study provided essential information on the heavy metal contamination in both the surface and sub-surface sediments of the Yangzonghai Lake. In addition, it is suggested that groundwater should be taken into consideration to assess the heavy metal contamination in the sediment of fault-controlled plateau lakes.

The distribution of macrophytes is strongly associated with water depth. Macrofossils from a 7.82-m sediment core indicate that the dominant taxa in past aquatic plant communities were almost the same as those that dominate the lake today. In combination with sediment geochemical variables TOC, TN, and delta C-13(bulk-org), macrofossil assemblages (aquatic plant remains, stem encrustations, and mollusc shells) were employed to reconstruct lake-level fluctuations over the past 16 ka. The lake formed or refilled at 15.3 cal ka and sustained a low level until 11.4 cal ka. From 11.4 to 6.3 cal ka, a remarkably high level was punctuated by a period of relatively low level between 9.2 and 7.4 cal ka. Stepwise drops in lake level occurred from 6.3 to 5.5 cal ka. Water level was characterized by more frequent fluctuations between 5.5 and 4.1 cal ka. Low level persisted from 4.1 to 2.1 cal ka and from 1.6 to 0.3 cal ka. Short-lived episodes of high water level were centered around 1.8 cal ka and since 0.3 cal ka. The lake-level history of Genggahai Lake appears to be largely consistent with the Asian monsoon records from nearby and distant locations. Our preliminary results suggest that monsoon variability on centennial to millennial timescales was superimposed on the long-term pattern of the Asian monsoon, modulated by orbitally induced summer insolation, and that the Asian monsoon may play an important role in water balance in marginal regions.

The interplay of methane and ammonia as key oxygen consuming constituents in early stage development of Base Mine Lake, the first demonstration oil sands pit lake	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The efficacy of oil sands water capped tailings technology is currently being assessed in the first pilot pit lake in the Athabasca Oil Sands region (AOSR). Base Mine Lake (BML, Syncrude Canada Mildred Lake mine, Fort McMurray AB Canada) was commissioned in December of 2012 and consists of circa 40m depth of fluid fine tailings (FFT) overlain by circa 10m of a freshwater cap. As this is the first oil sands pit lake, it is unknown to what extent known oxygen consuming constituents (OCC) such as methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia will mobilize from the underlying FFT layer in BML and impact oxygen concentrations within the water cap. Thus, the field objectives here were to characterize the physico-chemistry and geochemistry of the BML water cap from the FFT water interface (FWI) to the surface over two summers (2015 and 2016). Results identify that the similar to 10m water cap thermally stratifies and that oxygen persists, albeit at low levels (i.e. <5% saturation) to the FWI during the summer season for both years. Consistent with the FFT acting as an OCC source, aqueous CH4, Sigma H2S and NH4+ concentrations were highest closer to the FWI, decreasing upwards into the water cap. As O-2 persists to the FWI, Sigma H2S was rapidly removed within this region, with little mobilized to the overlying water as evidenced by nondetectable Sigma H2S within 1 m of the FWI. In contrast, CH4 and NH4+ concentrations were detectable higher up into the water cap, indicating incomplete oxidation at the FWI most likely due to oxygen limitation. In 2015, CH4 was the only identified variable significantly negatively related to BML water cap oxygen concentrations. However in 2016, NH4+ emerged as an important OCC negatively related to water cap oxygen concentrations in addition to CH4. Mass balance of nitrogen redox species throughout the water column are consistent with active nitrification occurring in 2016; which was not evident in 2015 results. Thus, within 4 years of commissioning, nitrification has become an active and important process affecting water column oxygen concentrations within this pit lake. This is in contrast to an absence of detectable microbial nitrification in active oil sands tailing ponds, despite high levels of ammonia. While the absence of nitrification occurring in oil sands tailings ponds has previously been suggested to reflect naphthenic acids toxicity, results here identify that some lower limit of oxygen may also be required for this metabolism to flourish and that at very low oxygen levels (i.e. <5% saturation), nitrifying microbes appear to be outcompeted by methanotrophs, at least during early establishment stages within a pit lake.

Lithostratigraphic analysis and geochemistry of a vitric spatter-bearing ignimbrite: the Quaternary Adeje Formation, Canadas volcano, Tenerife	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The 1.5-Ma Adeje Formation in SW Tenerife contains an ignimbrite sheet with remarkable textural and chemical complexity. A basal Plinian pumice-fall layer is overlain by a partly welded compound ignimbrite in which phonolitic pumice lapilli and dense obsidian spatter rags with irregular, fluidal-shaped margins are supported in a poorly sorted tuff matrix. The lower ignimbrite flow-unit contains accretionary lapilli in its upper part, overlain by an ash-pellet-bearing fallout layer from a co-ignimbrite plume. The upper ignimbrite flow-unit comprises a locally welded massive lapilli-tuff that grades up into lithic breccia containing juvenile obsidian blocks and both cognate and vent-derived lithic blocks. Geochemically, the Adeje Formation shows two distinct juvenile populations that relate to crystal-poor and crystal-rich magma types. Crystal-rich juvenile clasts contain multiple compositions of ilmenite and magnetite, and crystal aggregates of bytownite (An79-86). The varied assemblage of juvenile clasts reflects an eruptive style that may have involved rapid changes in magma chamber pressure associated with caldera collapse, and possibly the disruption of a lava lake. The Adeje eruption started with a Plinian explosive phase that rained ash and pumice lapilli across SW Tenerife; followed by pyroclastic fountaining feeding density currents with explosive ejecta of juvenile glassy material producing the coarse, spatter-bearing ignimbrite facies. A short pause between pyroclastic density currents is recorded by the co-ignimbrite ash and pellet-fall bed. The climactic phase of the eruption probably involved caldera subsidence as recorded by a widespread massive heterolithic breccia.					; CARRASCO, GERARDO/AAP-2255-2020; Davila Harris, Pablo/C-7891-2013; Harris, Pablo/H-4148-2019	Carrasco, Gerardo/0000-0003-4213-1925; Davila Harris, Pablo/0000-0002-0620-5459; Branney, Michael/0000-0002-9126-7178; 													0258-8900	1432-0819				JUN	2013	75	6							722	10.1007/s00445-013-0722-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-013-0722-5													WOS:000321776100007
J	Hastenrath, S				Hastenrath, Stefan			Circulation mechanisms of climate anomalies in East Africa and the equatorial Indian Ocean	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												The "Short Rains" at the coast of equatorial East Africa, concentrated around October-November, are highly variable and have an extremely tight concurrent correlation with the westerlies over the central equatorial Indian Ocean. The equatorial westerlies drive the Wyrtki Jet in the upper ocean and enhance the westward temperature gradient, and they are the surface manifestation of a powerful zonal-vertical circulation cell along the Indian Ocean Equator at this time of the year. With a strong equatorial circulation cell, the enhanced subsidence and cool surface waters in the West serve to reduce the rainfall over East Africa, and conversely the enhanced ascending motion and warm waters in the East favor precipitation in Indonesia. In the interannual variability over the second half of the 20th century, the years 1961, 1994 and 1997 stand out with particularly weak westerlies over the central equatorial Indian Ocean and disastrous floods in East Africa. At longer time scales, there is evidence of an enhancement of the equatorial westerlies accompanying the drop of lake levels and onset of glacier recession in East Africa in the last two decades of the 19th century. Despite the tight concurrent correlations, the prospects for seasonal forecasting are modest. Predictability decreased from the 1958-1977 to the 1978-1997 period, although the boreal autumn equatorial zonal circulation cell remained strong throughout. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

M.; Thiery, Wim			Modelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) - Part 1: Observational analysis	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa and one of the two major sources of the Nile river. The water level of Lake Victoria is determined by its water balance, consisting of precipitation on the lake, evaporation from the lake, inflow from tributary rivers and lake outflow, controlled by two hydropower dams. Due to a scarcity of in situ observations, previous estimates of individual water balance terms are characterized by substantial uncertainties, which means that the water balance is often not closed independently. In this first part of a two-paper series, we present a water balance model for Lake Victoria, using state-of-the-art remote sensing observations, high-resolution reanalysis downscaling and outflow values recorded at the dam. The uncalibrated computation of the individual water balance terms yields lake level fluctuations that closely match the levels retrieved from satellite altimetry. Precipitation is the main cause of seasonal and interannual lake level fluctuations, and on average causes the lake level to rise from May to July and to fall from August to December. Finally, our results indicate that the 2004-2005 drop in lake level can be about half attributed to a drought in the Lake Victoria Basin and about half to an enhanced outflow, highlighting the sensitivity of the lake level to human operations at the outflow dam.

J	Huang, W; Zhou, JZ; Zhang, DY				Huang, Wei; Zhou, Jianzhong; Zhang, Dongying			Exploring Empirical Linkage of Water Level-Climate-Vegetation across the Three Georges Dam Areas	WATER												The Three Georges Dam (TGD) has brought many benefits to the society by periodically changing the water level of its reservoir (TGR). Water discharging regularly takes places in the falling season when the downstream of the Yangtze River is drying. The TGD, the world's largest hydroelectric project, can greatly mitigate the risk of flood caused by extreme precipitation with the prior discharging policy applied in the preflood season. At the end of flood season, water impounding in the storage season can help resist a drought the next year. However, owing to the difficulty in mining causality, the considerable debate about its environmental and climatic impacts have emerged in much of the empirical and modeling studies. We used causal generative neural networks (CGNN) to construct the linkage of water level climate vegetation across the TGD areas with a ten-year daily remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gauge-based precipitation, temperature observations, water level and streamflow. By quantifying the causality linkages with a non-linear Granger-causality framework, we find that the 30-days accumulated change of water level of the TGR significantly affects the vegetation growth with a median factor of 31.5% in the 100 km buffer region. The result showed that the vegetation dynamics linked to the water level regulation policy were at the regional scale rather than the local scale. Further, the water level regulation in the flood stage can greatly improve the vegetation growth in the buffer regions of the TGR area. Specifically, the explainable Granger causalities of the 25 km, 50 km, 75 km and 100 km buffer regions were 21.72%, 19.24%, 17.31% and 16.03%, respectively. In the falling and impounding stages, the functionality of the TGR that boosts the vegetation growth were not obvious (ranging from 6.1% to 8.3%). Overall, the results demonstrated that the regional vegetation dynamics were driven not only by the factor of climate variations but also by the TGR operation.

J	Wünnemann, B; Yan, DD; Ci, R				Wuennemann, Bernd; Yan, Dada; Ci, Ren			Morphodynamics and lake level variations at Paiku Co, southern Tibetan Plateau, China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Proxy records from lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are commonly used to infer monsoon-related climatic changes during the late Quaternary. Specific influences of catchment processes and their interaction with the lake basin are seldom utilized. Based on morphological field investigations, supported by remote sensing analyses in combination with radiocarbon-dated sediment data from lacustrine sequences along paleoshorelines and terraces, we can demonstrate that close relationships exist between glacier dynamics, fluvial-alluvial fan/terrace formation and lake level and lake area changes of Paiku Co, southern Tibet. Our results show that the formation of large-scale, fluvial-alluvial fans (F1) predates the maximum advance of the Xixiabangma glaciers. The latter formed a distinct terminal moraine complex north of the present glaciers during the local LGM (LLGM) at 42-21 cal ky BP. A younger fan generation (F2) developed from the LLGM to the late Holocene, which was accompanied by lake level fluctuations with a generally decreasing trend. The highest morphologically traceable lake level at 4665 m asl existed prior to 25 cal ky BP and induced a potential overflow to the neighboring Langqiang Co and Pengqu River. A high level also existed during the LLGM, followed by a minor decline until ca. 15 cal ky BP, owing to reduced meltwater discharge under cold and dry climatic conditions. A return to the previous level during the late-glacial/early Holocene period between 11.9 and 9.5 cal Icy BP is likely caused by climate warming, increased meltwater discharge, and enhanced Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) moisture supply. Afterwards, Pailcu Co shrank gradually toward its present level, while the youngest fan (F3) generation evolved as individual small-sized bodies under ephemeral discharge conditions from the mid-Holocene to the present. The formation of four terrace levels (T4-1) is likely the result of sequential incision into the fan generations with a mean erosion rate of 50 cm/ky, caused by lake level lowering. Tectonic impact cannot be completely ruled out Since 1976, the glaciers lost ca. 15% in area, accompanied by lake area loss of -3.7% between 1972 and June 2014. Seasonal lake level variations of about 1-2 m in height occur in response to summer monsoon rainfall. Our data show a close interaction between glacial dynamics, fluvial processes, terrace formation, and water budget changes throughout the last 25 cal ky BP in response to the well-known, insolation-driven, ISMeffective moisture supply during the late-glacial and Holocene period. Temperature-driven meltwater dynamics were the controlling factors for variations in water balance of Paiku Co. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Similar abrupt warming is also evident at this time in high latitudes and in air trapped in Greenland ice. We here report new supporting evidence of this event from a climatically sensitive region in Africa: the White Nile valley of the central Sudan and Lake Albert in the Uganda headwaters. During the Last Glacial Maximum the White Nile valley was even more and than it is today, with desert dunes active as far south as latitude 12 degrees S. The sudden overflow of Lake Victoria in the Ugandan headwaters of the White Nile similar to 14.5ka, confirmed here by Sr-isotope statigraphy, caused extensive flooding in the lower White Nile valley and severe flooding in Egypt. The volume of fresh water flowing into the eastern Mediterranean at this time ultimately resulted in accumulation of highly organic sediments (Sapropel 1) on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. Flooding in the central Sudan attained an elevation of 382 in along a north-south distance of similar to 400 km. The recessional shoreline of the 382m White Nile is indicated by concentrations of now buried freshwater gastropod shells and beach sands dated, respectively, by calibrated AMS radiocarbon and OSL to similar to 15-16 ka. This mega-flood event marks the abrupt return of the summer monsoon and may reflect a globally synchronous event. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bai, XZ; Wang, J; Sellinger, C; Clites, A; Assel, R				Bai, Xuezhi; Wang, Jia; Sellinger, Cynthia; Clites, Anne; Assel, Raymond			Interannual variability of Great Lakes ice cover and its relationship to NAO and ENSO	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The impacts of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Great Lakes ice cover were investigated using lake ice observations for winters 1963-2010 and National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. It is found that both NAO and ENSO have impacts on Great Lakes ice cover. The Great Lakes tend to have lower (higher) ice cover during the positive (negative) NAO. El Nino events are often associated with lower ice cover. The influence of La Nina on Great Lakes ice cover is intensity-dependent: strong (weak) La Nina events are often associated with lower (higher) ice cover. The interference of impacts of ENSO and NAO complicates the relationship between ice cover and either of them. The nonlinear effects of ENSO on Great Lakes ice cover are important in addition to NAO effects. The correlation coefficient between the quadratic Nino3.4 index and ice cover (-0.48) becomes significant at the 99% confidence level. The nonlinear response of Great Lakes ice cover to ENSO is mainly due to the phase shift of the teleconnection patterns during the opposite phases of ENSO. Multiple-variable nonlinear regression models were developed for ice coverage. Using the quadratic Nino3.4 index instead of the index itself can significantly improve the prediction of Great Lakes ice cover (the correlation between the modeled and observed increases from 0.35 to 0.51). Including the interactive term NAO center dot Nino3.4(2) further improves the prediction skill (the correlation increases from 0.51 to 0.59). The analysis is also applied to individual lakes. The model for Lake Michigan has the highest prediction skill, while Lake Erie has the smallest skill.

Real-time automated recorders offer a promising solution, but their feasibility needs testing and validation. The acoustic camera is an efficient method to obtain real-time records of the behavior of Hemimysis anomala, a mysid that has invaded a variety of aquatic ecosystems. This approach is also a valuable tool for high-quality video recordings of mysid swarms in shallow habitats. The feasibility of this device to record the continuous behavior, including exit and entry (hereafter referred to as emergence and homing) from a shelter over a diel cycle was validated. Emergence consistently correlated with the onset of civil twilight, while homing displayed more intricate temporal trends. Homing events were longer than emergence events, but both were significantly influenced by light conditions. The termination of emergence was concomitant to the onset of the light preference as already shown by past studies. However, homing showed an earlier onset before light conditions exceeded the preference values, possibly due to inter-individual variability and/or information sharing in swarm behavior. The survey also captured the collapse in the targets number detected by the end of March, underlining the termination of the winter swarm. Furthermore, we demonstrated the importance of highfrequency temporal resolution, with a sampling frequency of at least 10-min, to accurately capture the swarm behavior. Overall, we provide original new insights characterizing H. anomala ecology and encourage the development of real-time automated recorders to track the behavior of IAS.

During winter the lake is completely mixed and mainly forced by the passage of synoptic weather systems. The lake's dynamic response was identified using various wind regimes. The response of the lake to a uniform wind stress resulted in the formation of a double-gyre circulation pattern. After removal of the wind stress, the double-gyre pattern slowly rotated cyclonically (with a time period of several days) around the lake perimeter, consistent with the pattern of the lowest-mode basin-scale topographic (vorticity) wave. The use of RAMS-simulated wind fields resulted in a less symmetric structure of the double-gyre pattern due to the presence of a curl in the wind field. Using various wind regimes to force the lake indicated that the presence of a positive or negative curl in the wind field might result in a shift in the topographic wave frequency to a higher or lower value, respectively. This result may be easily applied to motions on the geophysical scale. The currents predicted by RAMS-ROMS agree well with measured data near the center of the lake. Forcing the model with a spatially uniform wind field constructed from a single station resulted in poor agreement with the observed currents, indicating the importance of the wind field spatial pattern.					; Ashkenazy, Yosef/AAV-3218-2020	KATSAFADOS, PETROS/0000-0001-7452-0138; Ashkenazy, Yosef/0000-0001-9405-068X; Rimmer, Alon/0000-0003-1291-6975													2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC 29	2007	112	C12							C12024	10.1029/2007JC004336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JC004336													WOS:000252015100004

All sites depict seasonal isotopic cycles characterized by heavy isotope depletions during the snowmelt period and heavy isotope enrichments throughout the ice-free period. The data define H-2-O-18 regression lines falling below the meteoric water line. In the Ottawa River, calculations suggest that approximately 8% of the total inflow to the basin is lost through evaporation. In the St. Lawrence River main channel, seasonal isotopic fluctuations most likely reflect hydrological processes occurring within the Great Lakes and mixing with tributaries located downstream. In the St. Lawrence River fluvial estuary, isotopic data allow partitioning streamflow components and suggest that the recorded seasonal variations mainly respond to mixing processes.

J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Briggs, R; Khan, AA; Puestow, T				Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Briggs, Robert; Khan, Amir Ali; Puestow, Thomas			Requirements for the Development and Operation of a Freeze-Up Ice-Jam Flood Forecasting System	WATER												This article provides a comprehensive overview of ice-jam flood forecasting methodologies applicable to rivers during freezing. It emphasizes the importance of understanding river ice processes and fluvial geomorphology for developing a freeze-up ice-jam flood forecasting system. The article showcases a stochastic modelling approach, which involves simulating a deterministic river ice model multiple times with varying parameters and boundary conditions. This approach has been applied to the Exploits River at Badger in Newfoundland, Canada, a river that has experienced several freeze-up ice-jam floods. The forecasting involves two approaches: predicting the extent of the ice cover during river freezing and using an ensemble method to determine backwater flood level elevations. Other examples of current ice-jam flood forecasting systems for the Kokem & auml;enjoki River (Pori, Finland), Saint John River (Edmundston, NB, Canada), and Churchill River (Mud Lake, NL, Canada) that are operational are also presented. The text provides a detailed explanation of the processes involved in river freeze-up and ice-jam formation, as well as the methodologies used for freeze-up ice-jam flood forecasting. Ice-jam flood forecasting systems used for freeze-up were compared to those employed for spring breakup. Spring breakup and freeze-up ice-jam flood forecasting systems differ in their driving factors and methodologies. Spring breakup, driven by snowmelt runoff, typically relies on deterministic and probabilistic approaches to predict peak flows. Freeze-up, driven by cold temperatures, focuses on the complex interactions between atmospheric conditions, river flow, and ice dynamics. Both systems require air temperature forecasts, but snowpack data are more crucial for spring breakup forecasting. To account for uncertainty, both approaches may employ ensemble forecasting techniques, generating multiple forecasts using slightly different initial conditions or model parameters. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in ice-jam flood forecasting systems and to identify gaps and areas for improvement in existing ice-jam flood forecasting approaches, with a focus on enhancing their accuracy, reliability, and decision-making potential. In conclusion, an effective freeze-up ice-jam flood forecasting system requires real-time data collection and analysis, historical data analysis, ice jam modeling, user interface design, alert systems, and integration with other relevant systems. This combination allows operators to better understand ice jam behavior and make informed decisions about potential risks or mitigation measures to protect people and property along rivers. The key findings of this review are as follows: (i) Ice-jam flood forecasting systems are often based on simple, empirical models that rely heavily on historical data and limited real-time monitoring information. (ii) There is a need for more sophisticated modeling techniques that can better capture the complex interactions between ice cover, water levels, and channel geometry.

In both laboratory and lake studies, lower light intensities produced taller plants with fewer stems per propagule than plants grown at higher light intensities. Such a growth pattern may allow P. crispus to exist in deeper or less transparent water than other aquatic plants. Rapid growth in the early spring apparently permits P. crispus to become dominant while other possible competitors are still dormant.																			0008-4026						1984	62	12					2822	2826		10.1139/b84-376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b84-376													WOS:A1984ACA6800040
J	Armenteros, I; Ghannem, N				Armenteros, Ildefonso; Ghannem, Naoufel			A wet climatic terrestrial carbonate record in the middle-upper Pleistocene, north Tunisia	FACIES												The middle-upper Pleistocene Borj Edouane unit records a singular spectrum of terrestrial carbonates in a shallow depression on Cretaceous rocks in north Tunisia. This study aims to decipher the depositional system and reveal the climatic and paleohydrological conditions of the carbonate facies deposition. They are grouped into two facies associations: (1) a calcrete-palustrine and (2) a composite microbialite-travertine, surrounded by a marginal alluvial association along the western and northern borders of the basin. The calcrete-palustrine association extends along the westernmost south-north strip of the basin, reflecting calcrete development on distal alluvial fan deposits and pedogenic modification (palustrine facies) of shallow fresh-water carbonates. The composite microbialite-travertine, extending along north-south strips in the middle and eastern areas of the basin, consists of microbialite, clastic microbialite-travertine, and travertine associations. Microbialites were developed in fluvio-lacustrine environments within the central strip and pass eastward into the travertines through the clastic microbialite-travertine association. The latter was deposited from currents and in shallow ponds along a bench next to the travertine-depositing springs, linked to a fault system in the eastern margin of the basin. The carbonate depositional system shows an asymmetrical distribution of facies that parallels the paleohydrological asymmetry along the basin. Water supply was restricted in the western part of the basin and abundant in its eastern areas linked to spring waters that kept stable lake levels in the basin center, favoring the genesis of microbialites. The presence of lacustrine carbonates in the studied area indicates higher water availability during the Middle-Late Pleistocene and that climate in North Africa was wetter than today.					; Ghannem, Naoufel/S-8420-2018; Armenteros, Ildefonso/K-9983-2014	Armenteros, Ildefonso/0000-0003-2570-3450; Ghannem, Naoufel/0000-0003-2262-9566; 													0172-9179	1612-4820				NOV 12	2020	67	1							5	10.1007/s10347-020-00612-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10347-020-00612-x													WOS:000589091800001

At present, the existence of Omnsbreen is mainly dependent on wind-borne snow redistributed by the prevailing westerly winter-wind, and lies in an area of marginal permafrost occurrence. During the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) both the glacier and the distribution of permafrost in the area reached their maximum late-Holocene areal extents. The first occurrence of Omnsbreen is recorded in sediment cores retrieved from a proglacial lake and dated at AD 1425, and marks the onset of the local LIA. Reconstruction of the maximum LIA extent by means of geomorphic indicators revealed a size of 7.1 km(2), a volume of more than 0.25 km(3) and a maximum glacier thickness of 110 m. Since the LIA Omnsbreen has been reduced by more than 90% in area. Omnsbreen retreated rapidly from its LIA maximum, which we suggest was determined by the shape of the glacier, filling up the valley, and hence being unable to accumulate wind-borne snow. Prominent glacier marginal landforms are absent along the maximum LIA extent of Omnsbreen. We propose that the lack of glacier marginal landforms in this case is indicative of a cold glacier margin, and that the landscape evolution in maritime and marginal permafrost regions is characterised as being closely connected with glacial activity.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2013	23	6					796	809		10.1177/0959683612471984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683612471984													WOS:000319228000003

Ecosystem change as a driver of fish recruitment dynamics: A case study of two Lake Erie yellow perch populations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Although previous research has identified ways in which environmental conditions influence population processes in many ecosystems, these relationships often weaken or break down with the inclusion of additional years of data, for reasons that remain unclear. To better understand if and how the relationships between historically important environmental drivers of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) recruitment varied during 1969-2018 in two Lake Erie basins characterised by contrasting productivity, we used dynamic linear modelling, which allows for nonstationary relationships between predictor and response variables to be quantified. Our analyses revealed that abiotic conditions during egg and larval development (i.e. winter temperature, springtime river inflows, and thermal conditions) were important in the productive west basin, whereas a combination of abiotic (i.e. winter temperature and river inflows) and biotic (i.e. small-bodied and large-bodied predators) conditions were important in the less-productive central basin. While the importance of most environmental factors to yellow perch recruitment remained static through time, the importance of river inflows changed through time in the west and central basins. Large-bodied predators (i.e. walleye, Sander vitreus) also varied in their importance through time in the central basin. These changes in recruitment drivers were independent of temporal changes to the environmental conditions themselves, coinciding instead with the timing of major shifts in Lake Erie's nutrient status. Our results demonstrate that ecosystem change can cause the relationships between environmental conditions and population processes (e.g. recruitment) of aquatic organisms to vary through time and space. They also highlight the value of periodically revisiting their applicability, especially if these relationships are used to help manage or sustain populations in ecosystems experiencing human-driven environmental change.

Surface changes and wind velocities were monitored at Hoffmaster State Park, Saugatuck Harbor Natural Area, and Mount Baldy at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore from October to April in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. Over 70% of the events with wind speeds at least two standard deviations above the mean were associated with extratropical cyclones. The wind directions depended on the cyclone path, with westerly or southerly components most common. Local conditions moderated the effects of storm winds on surface change. The greatest surface changes measured in a trough blowout at Saugatuck Harbor Natural Area were associated with regional winds with a component blowing up the lee slope that produced bifurcated windflow within the trough. While the orientation of a given dune strongly influences the amount of surface change, it does not always follow a simple pattern deduced from dune geometry. Surface changes at Hoffmaster State Park and Saugatuck Harbor Natural Area during a normal winter (2010-2011) and an unusually warm winter (2011-2012) suggest that colder weather conditions inhibited net transfer of sand from the beach but had less impact away from the shore. Moisture also inhibited sand transport, but strong storm winds moved wet sand, sometimes over long distances at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Overall our results show that winds associated with extratropical cyclones play a vital role in the development of Lake Michigan dune complexes.

J	Sondergaard, M; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E				Sondergaard, M; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E			Role of sediment and internal loading of phosphorus in shallow lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				The sediment plays an important role in the overall nutrient dynamics of shallow lakes. In lakes where the external loading has been reduced, internal phosphorus loading may prevent improvements in lake water quality. At high internal loading, particularly summer concentrations rise, and phosphorus retention can be negative during most of the summer. Internal P loading originates from a pool accumulated in the sediment at high external loading, and significant amounts of phosphorus in lake sediments may be bound to redox-sensitive iron compounds or fixed in more or less labile organic forms. These forms are potentially mobile and may eventually be released to the lake water. Many factors are involved in the release of phosphorus. Particularly the redox sensitive mobilization from the anoxic zone a few millimetres or centimetres below the sediment surface and microbial processes are considered important, but the phosphorus release mechanisms are to a certain extent lake specific. The importance of internal phosphorus loading is highly influenced by the biological structure in the pelagic, and lakes shifting from a turbid to a clearwater state as a result of, for example, biomanipulation may have improved retention considerably. However, internal loading may increase again if the turbid state returns. The recovery period following a phosphorus loading reduction depends on the loading history and the accumulation of phosphorus in the sediment, but in some lakes a negative phosphorus retention continues for decades. Phosphorus can be released from sediment depths as low as 20 cm. The internal loading can be reduced significantly by various restoration methods, such as removal of phosphorus-rich surface layers or by the addition of iron or alum to increase the sediment's sorption capacity.

Control simulations for January and July of 1979 were made using MM4, and the Pleistocene highstand surface areas of the lakes were added to the model and the simulations repeated. In the January simulations, 18% of the moisture added to the modeled atmosphere by Lake Lahontan returned to the Lahontan basin as precipitation, while 32% of the water evaporated from Lake Bonneville fell as precipitation over the Bonneville basin. In the July simulations, 7% of the moisture added to the modeled atmosphere by Lake Lahontan returned to the Lahontan basin as precipitation, and 4% of the water evaporated from Lake Bonneville fell as precipitation over the Bonneville basin. An additonal January simulation was made with the lake surface areas set at onehalf their highstand extents (the average surface area 20 to 15 ka BP). Results from this simulation were similar to the simulation with the highstand lakes, indicating lake-effect precipitation could have been a significant component of the hydrologic budgets of the lakes before and during the highstand period.

Shift happens: Evaluating the ability of autumn stocked walleye Sander vitreus to shift to natural prey	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Hatchery propagation techniques, such as pellet-rearing, can result in altered feeding behaviour. Walleye Sander vitreus (Mitchill) is a commonly propagated sportfish, yet little is known regarding its ability to switch to live prey post-stocking. The objectives were to evaluate temporal changes in diet composition and condition as well as evaluate the relationship between total length and presence of different prey consumed by stocked walleye fry and fingerlings. Fingerling walleye had higher average proportions of empty stomachs and benthic invertebrates but less fish that stocked walleye fry. The presence of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates or fish was not related to walleye length. Walleye condition was similar between cohorts and did not change over days post-stocking. Percent similarity index values between cohorts were variable (0.0 to 67.9%). It was concluded that stocked walleye fingerlings consume lower quality prey items than stocked fry counterparts at least up to 49-day post-stocking, which may have implications for post-stocking survival.

J	Worthington, EB				Worthington, E. B.			THE LAKES OF KENYA AND UGANDA	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Devoted mainly to the geography of Lakes Rudolf and Baringo in Kenya and Lakes Edward and George in Uganda. They have been sounded for the first time, parts have been surveyed and mapped, and preliminary biological surveys have been completed. A section is devoted to distribution and history of the fauna, especially fish. There are 2 types of aquatic fauna in the Nile system: (1) that of Albert, Rudolf and the Lower Nile, characterised by the genera Lates, Hydrocyon, Citherinus, etc.; (2) that of Victoria, Kioga, Edward and George, where these genera are absent but where there are many endemic kinds of Cichlidae. The Murchison Falls on the Victoria Nile isolate Victoria and Kioga, and the Semliki Falls isolate Edward and George. Evidently the fauna of Edward and George was exterminated during the interpluvial (Pleistocene) arid period when these lakes were dried out. The same probably applies to Victoria and Kioga. Since the lakes refilled, the quickly evolving Cichlidae have peopled each with endemic forms. Geological evidence is summoned in favor of this view, and its explains the remarkable distribution of Crocodiles. A last section deals with the exploitation of fisheries, partly by using indigenous species and partly by introducing other fish. In a table all the lakes of Kenya and Uganda are compared with reference to area, depth, temp., alkalinity and pH.																			0016-7398	1475-4959				APR	1932	79	4					275	297		10.2307/1784327	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1784327													WOS:000203672500002

Since most metrics require obtaining mean values, this paper presents data that may help speed up field work and find indicators for a rapid water quality assessment based on single samplings, allowing simultaneous work on many sites. The phytoplankton from 43 Bulgarian waterbodies collected during three summer campaigns (2018, 2019, 2021) at sites selected after drone observations was studied by conventional light microscopy (LM) and an HPLC analysis of marker pigments. Our results allowed us to recommend drones and the HPLC application as reliable methods in rapid water quality assessments. In total, 787 algae from seven phyla (53 alien, new for Bulgaria) were identified. Chlorophyta was the taxonomically richest group, but Cyanoprokaryota dominated the biomass in most sites. New PCR data obtained on anatoxin and microcystin producers confirmed the genetic diversity of Cuspidothrix and Microcystis and provided three new species for the country's toxic species, first identified by LM. A statistical analysis revealed significant correlations of certain algal phyla and classes with different environmental variables, and their species are considered promising for future search of bioindicators. This is especially valid for the class Eustigmatophyceae, which, as of yet, has been almost neglected in water assessment procedures and indices.					; Stefanova, Katerina/KGK-8558-2024; Uzunov, Blagoy/AAK-9021-2021; Radkova, Mariana/GQO-9315-2022; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018	Uzunov, Blagoy/0000-0002-2285-8935; Miladinov, Peter/0000-0002-1753-1583; Stefanova, Katerina/0000-0002-0327-4408; Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737														1424-2818				APR	2023	15	4							472	10.3390/d15040472	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15040472													WOS:000979349200001

This study analyzed the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in the surface water, sediment, and fish of the Baiyangdian Lake. In the surface water, the total concentration of PFASs ranged in 1193-3462 ng L-1 (mean 1734 ng L-1) in the rainy season and 469-1724 ng L-1 (mean 876 ng L-1) in the dry season. The total concentration of PFASs in the sediment ranged in 1.97-13.3 ng g(-1) (mean 6.53 ng g(-1)). It was found that PFCAs and PFSAs with longer chains were more easily adsorbed in the sediment. Among the collected fish samples, the enrichment of PFASs in the tissues fell in the order of liver > cheek > muscle. For the muscle, stomach, and liver tissues of the fish samples, significant correlations existed between the delta N-15 values and the concentration of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The contents of PFOS and perfiuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the fish were not at a level high enough to significantly risk human health.																			0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT 30	2019	182								109454	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109454								31352209					WOS:000480673000074

The laboratory and in-situ results from three sites in Lake Borgne and the Terrebonne Parish were compared, and the interpretation was complemented by a geotechnical and geochemical laboratory analysis of the sediment. The results revealed that a higher organic content (10.4%) led to a lower consolidation of the material in the settling column tests, as well as a lower in-situ seabed strength. A higher content of coarse particles (41%) resulted in a quicker consolidation, particularly on the first of the fifteen settling column test days. This was also correlated to a steeper increase of sediment strength with sediment depth in the field. A significant deviation between the two tests was the presence of a 6-20 cm thick loose top layer at the seabed surface that was only observed in the field. This was likely related to ongoing sediment dynamics. As no storms or heavy rainfalls preceded the experiments, wake waves in response to boating activities may be considered as an explanation for the limited consolidation of sediments at the seabed surface.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8016-8				2016		273					449	458																WOS:000389439100045

We investigate the impacts of a planned 1000 MW PS scheme connecting Lago Bianco with Lago di Poschiavo (Switzerland) on temperature and particle mass concentration in both basins. The upper (turbid) basin is a reservoir receiving large amounts of fine particles from the partially glaciated watershed, while the lower basin is a much clearer natural lake. Stratification, temperature and particle concentrations in the two basins were simulated with and without PS for four different hydrological conditions and 27 years of meteorological forcing using the software CE-QUAL-W2. The simulations showed that the PS operations lead to an increase in temperature in both basins during most of the year. The increase is most pronounced (up to 4 degrees C) in the upper hypolimnion of the natural lake toward the end of summer stratification and is partially due to frictional losses in the penstocks, pumps and turbines. The remainder of the warming is from intense coupling to the atmosphere while water resides in the shallower upper reservoir. These impacts are most pronounced during warm and dry years, when the upper reservoir is strongly heated and the effects are least concealed by floods. The exchange of water between the two basins relocates particles from the upper reservoir to the lower lake, where they accumulate during summer in the upper hypolimnion (10 to 20 mg L-1) but also to some extent decrease light availability in the trophic surface layer.

Responses of Fragilarioid-dominated diatom assemblages in a small Arctic lake to Holocene climatic changes, Russell Island, Nunavut, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We present a paleolimnological record spanning the Holocene from a small lake on Russell Island (Lake PW02), in the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago (74.07 degrees N, 97.77 degrees W, 182 m asl). Fragilarioid diatom types in the genera Pseudostaurosira, Staurosira and Staurosirella constitute > 90% of valves in fossil samples. Using modern biogeographic data which specify the temperature optima of the Fragilarioid diatom taxa, we present new inferences about the timing of paleoclimatic changes in the central Arctic islands. The early Holocene was characterized by maximum values for sediment organic matter, and lower ratios of Staurosirella pinnata to Staurosira construens v. venter, suggesting warm summer air temperatures between about 9500-6500 cal year BP. Influxes of biogenic silica and diatom valves decreased following 4000 cal year BP, the sediment accumulation rate slowed and diatom taxa of the littoral zone diversified, suggesting cooler summers and more persistent lake ice. Variations in the species composition of the assemblages indicate paleoclimatic changes that are in broad agreement with other paleoenvironmental records from the Arctic including melt records from the Agassiz Ice Cap. Although autecological data remain incomplete for Fragilarioid taxa, our results indicate differences in these taxa in responses to paleoenvironmental change and underline the potential for the increased use of these taxa in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The record from Lake PW02, as in other records from Arctic lakes with low algal diversity throughout the Holocene, shows a pronounced increase in diatom diversity since the 1920s, and diatom production since the 1970s far exceeds any recorded during the Holocene.					; Gajewski, Konrad/L-5128-2017; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2008	40	4					1079	1095		10.1007/s10933-008-9215-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9215-5													WOS:000259481300005

To better understand the nutrient cycling in this meromictic lake, inorganic N and P concentrations were measured throughout the 1974-75 austral summer. Relatively low orthophosphate concentrations were found in the mixolimnion (mean value 6.45 .mu.g P/1) and relatively high concentrations in the monimolimnion (mean value 110 .mu.g P/1). Total inorganic N concentrations in the lake are high generally at all depths (up to 21.6 mg N/1), with ammonia dominating over nitrate and nitrite. Glacial meltstream activity during the short austral summer period of flow carried the bulk of P loading into the lake during the first 2 wk of flow. Inorganic N in the meltwater was principally in the form of nitrate. Nutrient loading from the melstream monitored does not appear to be significant on an annual basis compared to the concentrations of nutrients already present in the mixolimnion of the lake, although localized effects may be important if the meltstreams are not rapidly distributed throughout the lake. Concentrations of N and P found in samples of benthic algal mat taken from the lake show N : P ratios in the range 4.7-6.0. No limiting nutrient was identified, in contrast to previous investigations.																			0003-9136						1977	80	4					519	530																WOS:A1977EB87200004

The so called 'Herodotus Springs' at 'Keri Lake' in Zakynthos Island western Greece: A palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological approach	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In the present study the palaeoenvironmental setting of the coastal mire/swamp zone called 'Keri Lake', on Zakynthos Island, west Greece is presented. The mire/swamp area is famous for the asphalt-pitch seepages named as 'Herodotus-springs'. In order to interpret the Holocene evolution of the area, samples from four 7 m long vibracores were analyzed for their total organic carbon, total nitrogen and sulfur contents, as well as for their micro- and macro-fauna. The chronological framework of this study was based on three C-14 ages, while the age depth model and the sedimentation rate were estimated applying OxCal software. The age depth model indicates that the cores cover the period from the middle Holocene to present, with a mean sedimentation rate of 1 mm/yr. Before 4000 BP large part of the area inundated by the sea while after 4000 yrs BP the ecosystem changed to a high marsh and gradually to a fen environment, where peat accumulated under telmatic to limnotelmatic conditions. The trends and the ratios of the geochemical markers TOC, TN and TS clearly reflect the palaeoenvironmental change from terrestrial to fen depositional environments. The results show that during the middle Holocene the Herodotus Lake was influenced by sudden sea water inundation events, possibly as a result of high waves or storm events, while since the late Holocene the setting is that of a brackish coastal fen, where peat accumulates, under the significant inflow of fresh water that originates from the karstic systems of the catchment area.

Catchment-scale alder cover controls nitrogen fixation in boreal headwater streams	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Alder (Alnus spp.) is a woody plant with bacterial symbionts that fix atmospheric N-2 into bioavailable N. We studied 12 North American boreal headwater streams spanning a steep gradient of catchment alder cover (0-27%) to test the hypothesis that increasing inputs of inorganic N associated with increasing alder cover would reduce or eliminate in-stream benthic N-2 fixation. We measured N-2 fixation rates, chlorophyll a, and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of periphyton in early (May) and late (August) summer 2011. Dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentrations, composed almost entirely of NO3/NO2-N, ranged from below detection limits to nearly 2 mg/L and were strongly predicted by catchment alder cover in both months. Higher N-2 fixation rates were observed in August than in May. N-2 fixation rates declined sharply when alder cover exceeded similar to 2% of catchment cover, corresponding to 20 to 40 mu g/L DIN. This pattern also was evident among 3 streams with contrasting catchment alder cover sampled approximately every 2 wk during the study. The stream with no catchment alder cover exhibited a steady increase in N-2 fixation rates over the summer, whereas the streams with low and high alder in their catchments had very low N-2 fixation rates that did not vary over time. The influence of alder cover on periphyton biomass was not clear. The strong regulation of alder cover on in-stream N availability leads us to suggest that alder presence may be an important terrestrial regulator of stream N cycling.

Tauber traps were monitored monthly over a 2-year period in a coastal dune barrier, salt marsh and continental freshwater lake. Pollen deposition exhibited seasonal patterns with maximum values during summer and a spatial variability of increasing deposition from the coast to inland sites. The pollen spectra suggest that airborne pollen originates mainly from local vegetation with scarce representation of extraregional sources. Herbaceous pollen predominates, comprising up to 90% of the total amount with Poaceae, Chenopodiineae and Asteroideae as the main types. Hydrophytic, psammophytic and extraregional types had little influence on the pollen spectra, generally comprising < 5% of the total pollen. Pollen influx-vegetation abundance discrepancies were explained considering pollination syndrome, spatial distribution and structure of vegetation.

Control plots, moss-removal plots, and sedge-removal plots were studied to determine the role of these vegetation types in wetland methane emission and to study the gas transport mechanism. Methane emission was greatest from plots with intact sedges. Depth distributions of root density collected in 1995 showed a strong inverse relationship to pore water methane concentration. Results on insertion of arrays of gas-permeable silicone rubber tubing into the soil indicate that they are reasonable analogs for the physical process of gaseous diffusion through plants. The observed differences in flux between plots with and without sedges cannot be fully explained by differences in methane production or dissolved organic carbon concentrations in our measurements.

Investigation of interbasin exchange and interannual variability in Lake Erie using an unstructured-grid hydrodynamic model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Interbasin exchange and interannual variability in Lake Erie's three basins are investigated with the help of a three-dimensional unstructured-grid-based Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM). Experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of grid resolutions and different sources of wind forcing on the lake dynamics. Based on the calibrated model, we investigated the sensitivity of lake dynamics to major external forcing, and seasonal climatological circulation patterns are presented and compared with the observational data and existing model results. It was found that water exchange between the western basin (WB) and the central basin (CB) was mainly driven by hydraulic and density-driven flows, while density-driven flows dominate the interaction between the CB and the eastern basin (EB). River-induced hydraulic flows magnify the eastward water exchange and impede the westward one. Surface wind forcing shifts the pathway of hydraulic flows in the WB, determines the gyre pattern in the CB, contributes to thermal mixing, and magnifies interbasin water exchange during winter. Interannual variability is mainly driven by the differences in atmospheric forcing, and is most prominent in the CB.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012; Niu, Qian/G-9908-2013; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667; Niu, Qianru/0000-0002-5840-5655; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR	2015	120	3					2212	2232		10.1002/2014JC010457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010457													WOS:000353900000041

Ogof Draenen, near Blaenavon in south-east Wales, is the most recent major cave discovery (1994) with already > 70 km of passages explored spanning a vertical range of 148 m. With the exception of one small chamber (Siambre Ddu) located directly above the main Ogof Draenen system, very few bats have been noticed inside. Extensive accumulations of guano, attributable to Rhinolophus hipposideros, are however found in parts of the Ogof Draenen system. In places covering many square metres and sometimes building heaps > 0.5 m thick, these represent volumes not yet found in any other cave system in the British Isles. Although the date of the abandonment of the main Ogof Draenen system as a bat roost remains unknown, six radiocarbon dates on guano from Ogof Draenen place the occupation in the Iron Age to Medieval period at least. Palynological analysis was undertaken on ten samples distributed through the cave. Comparisons were made with a moss polster and a lake mud sample from the area to provide a first approximation of the regional modem pollen rain and with two modem guano samples, one from Siambre Ddu and one from Agen Allwedd cave (5 km to the north-west) to provide a temporal comparison with the fossil guano. Agen Allwedd cave currently is one of the largest active roosts for Lesser Horseshoe bats in Britain and lies close to the present northern limit of this endangered species in Europe. The main results are that (1) the cave appears to have been used both as a summer and a winter roost; (2) most of the Ogof Draenen guano is formed within c. 1600 C-14 years and, if the largest heap is continuous, it has accumulated within 750 C-14 years, i.e. 0.16 mm yr(-1); 3) the fossil guano samples reflect a relatively closed oak forest with more abundant ivy (Hedera) and holly (Ilex) than at present; (4) insect-pollinated plants such as Ilex, Acer, Hedera and Impatiens glandulifera are over-represented in the guano samples; (5) in addition to the usual causes of bat roost decline (pesticides, pollution), in the case of Ogof Draenen, we may add entrance blocked by rock collapse and decline of the local forest cover as well as change in its composition.

This can be achieved by using a broad spectrum of high resolution, multiple proxy records which can also allow us to assess linkages between regional hydroclimate variability and shifts in the large-scale atmospheric patterns. Here, we present a multiproxy reconstruction of the central-eastern Mediterranean hydro climate changes over the last 3600 years based on a sediment core from the Gialova Lagoon, a shallow coastal ecosystem in SW Peloponnese, Greece. Our combined dataset consists of the distribution and compound-specific carbon and hydrogen isotope (delta C-13 and 8D) composition of n-alkanes, bulk organic matter properties and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning data. This approach was complemented with a semi-quantitative analysis of plant remains in the core. The results indicate a high contribution of local aquatic vegetation to organic matter. Large delta C-13 variations in predominantly aquatic plant-derived mid-chain alkanes (C23-23) mainly reflect changes in the aquatic plant abundance and their carbon source. Our data suggest that higher delta C-13(23-25) values (up to 19 parts per thousand) largely correspond to expansion of aquatic vegetation during wet and/or cold periods causing carbon-limiting conditions in the water and assimilation of isotopically-enriched bicarbonate by the plants. The 8D records of the individual n-alkanes (C-17 to C-31) exhibit a nearly identical pattern to each other, which implies that they all reflect changes in the source water isotope composition, driven by hydroclimate variability. In addition, the 8D profiles are consistent with the XRF data with both proxies being driven by a common hydroclimate signal. We observe two major shifts from dry and/or warm periods at ca 3600-3000 cal BP and ca 17001300 cal BP to wet and/or cold episodes at ca 3000-2700 cal BP and ca 1300-900 cal BP. The period ca 700-200 cal BP is the wettest and/or coldest in our record and coeval with the Little Ice Age. The climatic fluctuation reported in this study can be explained by the relative dominance of high-latitude (e.g. North Atlantic Oscillation during winters) and the low-latitude atmospheric patterns (Intertropical convergence zone, Subtropical High and the effects of Asian monsoons during summers) which suggests an Atlantic-Mediterranean-Monsoon climate link in this area for the late Holocene.

The city of Severodvinsk is the largest industrial center for the Navy in North-western Russia. Soil samples were taken in the vicinity of the Severodvinsk industrial region in the areas where there are summer cottages and gathering places for wild berries and mushrooms collected by local residents. Heavy metal content studies were performed by ICP-MS. Measurements of the activity of radionuclides were carried out via the low-background semiconductor gamma-ray spectrometry method with a detector of especially pure germanium. Assessment of the degree of soil pollution with heavy metals was performed using geo-accumulation index parameters (Igeo), contamination factor (Cf), degree of contamination (Cd), enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk index (ERI). The radiation safety parameters of the Severodvinsk industrial region soils were calculated, as were the absorbed dose rate of gamma radiation D-R, the equivalent of radium Raeq, and the external hazard index Hex. The sources of soil pollution are natural (geogenic) and anthropogenic (enterprises of the military-industrial complex, city heating systems, transport). The studies found a low level of heavy metal pollution and radionuclides in the soils of the environments of the Severodvinsk industrial region. Soils can be used by local people to grow food at their summer cottages. Also, the studied area is favorable for the collection of wild mushrooms and berries. However, closer attention should be paid to certain parts of the territory, since for some metals (As, Mn, Cd, and Pb) an increase in the parameters of the degree of soil pollution (Igeo, C-f, C-d, EF, and ERI) is observed.

Depleted C isotope values were attributed to the incorporation of C-12-enriched metabolic C into the shell. Microsampling of longitudinal sections of shell revealed a seasonal pattern in the delta(13)C values. The seasonal pattern matched predictions that DIC delta(13)C and metabolic rate determine the final shell delta(13)C concentration. The greatest depletion of delta(13)C occurred in the summer. Similar delta(13)C patterns in marine and freshwater mollusks probably record not only temperature fluctuations, upwelling events, and phytoplankton blooms as reported, but also the changes in metabolic activity brought on by such events.

J	Livingstone, DM; Lotter, AF; Walker, IR				Livingstone, DM; Lotter, AF; Walker, IR			The decrease in summer surf are water temperature with altitude in Swiss Alpine lakes: A comparison with air temperature lapse rates	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Using miniature thermistors with integrated data loggers, the decrease in summer lake surface water temperature (LSWT) with increasing altitude a.s.l. was investigated in 10 Swiss Alpine lakes located between 613 m a.s.l. and 2339 m a.s.l. The LSWTs exhibit essentially the same short-term structure as regional air temperature, but are about 3 to 5 degrees C higher than the air temperature at the altitude of the lake. LSWTs decrease approximately linearly with increasing altitude at a rate slightly greater than the surface air temperature lapse rate. Diel variations in LSWT are large, implying that single water temperature measurements are unlikely to be representative bf the mean. Local factors will affect LSWT more than they affect air temperature, possibly resulting in severe distortion of the empirical relationship between the two. Several implications for paleoclimate reconstruction studies result. (1) Paleolimnologically reconstructed LSWTs are likely to be higher than the air temperatures prevailing at the altitude of the lake. (2) Lakes used for paleoclimate reconstruction should be selected to minimize local effects on LSWT. (3) The calibration of organism-specific quantitative paleotemperature inference models should not be based on single water temperature measurements. (4) Consideration should be given to calibrating such models directly against air temperature rather than water temperature. (5) The primary climate effect on the aquatic biota of high-altitude lakes may be mediated by the timing of the ice cover.

The Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides) is globally threatened and the most vulnerable goose species endemic to East Asia due to its small and rapidly declining population. To address a current knowledge gap in demographic parameters of the Swan Goose, available datasets were compiled from neck-collar resighting and telemetry studies, and two different models were used to estimate their survival rates. Results of a mark-resighting model using 15 years of neck-collar data (2001-2015) provided age -dependent survival rates and season -dependent encounter rates with a constant neck-collar retention rate. Annual survival rate was 0.638 (95% CI: 0.378-0.803) for adults and 0.122 (95% CI: 0.028-0.286) for first-year juveniles. Known-fate models were applied to the single season of telemetry data (autumn 2014) and estimated a mean annual survival rate of 0.408 (95% CI: 0.152-0.670) with higher but non-significant differences for adults (0.477) vs. juveniles (0.306). Our findings indicate that Swan Goose survival rates are comparable to the lowest rates reported for European or North American goose species. Poor survival may be a key demographic parameter contributing to their declining trend. Quantitative threat assessments and associated conservation measures, such as restricting hunting, may be a key step to mitigate for their low survival rates and maintain or enhance their population.					; Poyarkov, Nikolay/O-5148-2014; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Reis, Carla/J-3177-2019; Xiao, Xiangming/ABS-9360-2022; Goroshko, Oleg/AAC-9822-2022; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-3761-2019; Choi, Chang-Yong/Q-9577-2019	Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428; Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2016	39	3					277	286																WOS:000384631200006

Both suites of gabbro are within-plate tholeiites that range from sub-alkaline basalt to basaltic andesite in composition and are enriched in P2O5 and K2O. Collectively, the two suites are better interpreted as a single magmatic event, termed the Michael-Shabogamo Gabbro (MSG), with ages ranging from 1425 to 1450Ma, based on new U-Pb isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry baddeleyite ages of 1449 +/- 3, 1437 +/- 4 and 1435 +/- 10Ma, along with previously published ages. Within the MSG, two geochemical groups are evident. Most notably, each is characterized by differing P2O5/Zr (P/Zr) ratios: (1) a high P/Zr group, c. 1425-1437Ma; (2) a low P/Zr group, c. 1435-1450Ma. The positive slope of P2O5 versus Zr data arrays for each group indicates that melting of apatite was pivotal in influencing the rare earth element concentrations of the MSG magmas and their secular changes in geochemistry. K2O is enriched in the MSG relative to enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts and is correlated with P2O5, Ba and Rb. Multiple origins for the enrichment of P2O5 and K2O in the MSG are considered and the available evidence is most consistent with melting of a metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle source interpreted to originate by infiltration of partial melts of phosphate-rich sediments. A slab window is proposed to have facilitated lithospheric melting at c. 1425-1450Ma.

J	Rodusky, AJ				Rodusky, Andrew J.			The influence of large water level fluctuations and hurricanes on periphyton and associated nutrient storage in subtropical Lake Okeechobee, USA	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The abundance, community structure and nutrient content of periphyton, and the host plant taxa Chara, Hydrilla, Potamogeton, Vallisneria and Scirpus were studied in Lake Okeechobee, USA. Water levels were generally high during the study period (August 2002-January 2006), but substantial fluctuations occurred. All host plant biomass was seasonally variable but only Vallisneria biomass was spatially variable. All submerged plant beds disappeared after the passage of two hurricanes in September 2004, and a third hurricane passed over the lake in October 2005. Periphyton assemblages were statistically separated most by substrate and then by season. Prior to the hurricanes, annual maxima of periphyton biovolumes and those of summer submerged plant coverage coincided. During all study years, the diatom taxa dominated periphyton total biovolumes. Periphyton biomass was generally highest during the summer or prior to the hurricanes (in the case of epiphytes) and was spatially variable in the case of both Scirpus and Vallisneria. Epiphytic nutrient contents within each host plant group seasonally varied except for nitrogen and carbon in the Vallisneria epiphytes. Epipelic nutrient contents were spatially variable and seasonally variable for carbon. Nutrient contents in epipelon were significantly higher than that in Scirpus epiphytes and were similar but lower among all epiphytic communities. The total annual areal potential epiphytic phosphorus storage extrapolated during this study (2.0 x 10(-4) metric tons ha(-1) year(-1)) was underestimated because storage estimates for epipelon, Chara and Hydrilla-associated epiphytes were omitted. The Chara and Hydrilla-associated epiphytic nutrient storage values were omitted because of limited data, whereas the epipelic data may have not been spatially representative. For periphyton biovolume, host substrate type, water level fluctuation and hurricane impacts on host substrates appear to be more important than seasonal variation in such factors as temperature and nutrients. Epiphytic nutrient storage appears to be influenced most by water level fluctuation and hurricane-related impacts, while the host substrate type appears to be a less important factor than it is for periphyton biovolume. Maximum periphyton biomass and high nutrient storage in shallow subtropical and tropical eutrophic lakes may only occur at consistently lower water levels and during infrequent periods of disturbance, which enhance host substrate colonizable area.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2010	44	4					797	815		10.1007/s10452-010-9317-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9317-9													WOS:000285339300013

J	Berntsson, A; Rosqvist, GC; Velle, G				Berntsson, Annika; Rosqvist, Gunhild C.; Velle, Gaute			Late-Holocene temperature and precipitation changes in Vindelfjallen, mid-western Swedish Lapland, inferred from chironomid and geochemical data	HOLOCENE												In this article, we present results from a palaeolimnological study from Lake Vuoksjavratje in the mountain tundra region in the Vindelfjallen Mountains, northwest Sweden. We suggest that the influence of precipitation may be one of the factors causing discrepancies between chironomid-based late-Holocene July temperature (JulyT) reconstructions from Fennoscandia. We combine quantitative temperature reconstruction using chironomids for the last 5100 years with qualitative analysis of chironomid composition and geochemical analyses, such as x-ray fluorescence (XRF), total organic carbon (TOC) and C/N analysis. The studied sequence is dated by Pb-210, Cs-137 and 11 C-14 datings from terrestrial macrofossils. The aim of the study was to use chironomids to reconstruct late-Holocene summer temperature variation on a multi-centennial to centennial timescale and to use geochemical data to identify periods during which the changes in chironomid composition might have been forced by environmental variables other than temperature, such as within lake processes or precipitation. Based on ordination techniques, and a comparison between chironomid-inferred JulyTs and changes in minerogenic sedimentation with regional temperature and wetness records, it is concluded that the JulyT signal was modulated by precipitation. The proxies indicate that both JulyT and annual precipitation have influenced the chironomid communities in Lake Vuoksjavratje, and that catchment-related processes caused by enhanced precipitation have overridden the summer temperature signal between 3000 and 2200 cal. yr BP, and between 1050 and 100 cal. yr BP.					; Berntsson, Annika/B-3061-2013	Rosqvist, Gunhild/0000-0002-9195-607X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2014	24	1					78	92		10.1177/0959683613512167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613512167													WOS:000328828800007

Three years later, 90% (> 230) of the plant species that originally inhabited the area could be found, although dominance has sometimes changed drastically.

J	Carmack, E; Macdonald, R				Carmack, Eddy; Macdonald, Robie			Water and ice-related phenomena in the coastal region of the Beaufort Sea: Some parallels between Native experience and Western science	ARCTIC												Information gained through Native experience is combined here with scientific measurements to describe aspects of the wintertime oceanography of the Eskimo Lakes and Mackenzie River delta regions of the Canadian Beaufort Sea. The experiences of Jimmy Jacobson, a Tuktoyaktuk elder who lived in this region for over 70 years, were used as the basis for scientific planning and measurement. We focus on phenomena of special relevance to winter travel and fishing in four specific examples of Native insight guiding scientific inquiry. First, we examine local knowledge of ice characteristics and fish abundance in terms of tidal dispersion and its effect on mixing patterns during winter. Second, we relate the maintenance of a small ice-free area, used by caribou as a salt lick, to the vertical heat flux associated with flow through narrow channels. Third, we look at potentially dangerous episodes of overflooding of snow and ice in the nearshore zone in midwinter, caused by strong westerly winds, through the analysis of oxygen isotope distributions in ice cores. Fourth, we discuss the important influence of wind direction on ice conditions, lead formation, and brine production in semi-enclosed coastal bays. Finally, we note certain circulation features of ecological significance relevant to concerns about development and the transport of pollutants. We conclude that by not requiring agreement between indigenous knowledge and Western science, or ranking one above the other, we can realize the values of each approach. Specifically, indigenous knowledge can provide direction to scientific inquiry, while Western science can be used to measure, model, and predict where development or change might have the most serious impact.

Based on published research on past environmental changes on the TP, we synthesize changes in landscape and other environmental components, including temperature, moisture, vegetation, and aeolian activity, on the glacial-interglacial and the Holocene suborbital timescales. This synthesis elucidates the processes, patterns, and mechanisms of environmental changes on the TP, on multiple timescales. We also explore the possible impacts of environmental changes on prehistoric human activities by combining chronological data from archaeological sites since the Paleolithic with the latest advances in archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and archaeobotany. Our findings indicate the following: (1) On a glacial-interglacial timescale, the environmental evolution of the TP exhibits a high spatiotemporal consistency, characterized by cold and dry conditions with sparse vegetation during glacial periods, and warm and humid conditions with flourishing vegetation during interglacial periods. (2) On the Holocene suborbital timescale, summer temperatures on the TP generally show a Holocene thermal maximum. However, reconstructions of mean annual temperature changes vary, likely due to factors including seasonal biases and regional differences in mean annual temperature proxies. In terms of moisture, the northern TP (especially the northeastern TP), which is influenced by both the summer monsoon and the westerly circulation, shows increased moisture since the early Holocene, in contrast to decreasing moisture in the southern monsoon-dominated parts. This constitutes a north-south dipolar pattern of Holocene moisture changes. Furthermore, a series of abrupt climate events occurred on the TP during the Holocene, while there were pronounced regional differences in the environmental response to North Atlantic cooling events. Regarding terrestrial ecosystems, pollen assemblages reveal that vegetation succession on the TP generally responded to summer monsoon changes, with forest vegetation retreating and steppe/meadow vegetation expanding during the Holocene. Records of aeolian activity and paleosol development indicate that the northeastern TP experienced the most intensive aeolian activity in the early Holocene, while paleosol development was the most active during the middle-late Holocene. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of aeolian activity on the southern TP remain unclear. (3) On the glacial-interglacial timescale, prehistoric humans tended to spread from adjacent areas onto the TP during the relatively warm and biologically rich interglacials, while the harsh living environment during glacial periods restricted further exploration of the TP. (4) Promoted by the warmer and wetter climate and the expansion of millet agriculture in the Yellow River Basin, human activity on the northeastern TP intensified significantly during the early-middle Holocene. During 6.0-5.0 ka, the favorable climatic conditions promoted millet agriculture which resulted in the intensification of human activity on the northeastern TP. However, the gradual cooling after similar to 5.0 ka forced prehistoric human groups to migrate southward. During similar to 4.2-3.6 ka, significant cooling events led to reduced human activity and the transformation of subsistence strategies. The establishment of a mixed arable-pastoral economy became the primary driver for the rapid expansion of the spatial range of human settlement and the intensity of human activity since similar to 3.6 ka. Additionally, since 3.6 ka, increasing moisture on the northeastern TP and decreasing moisture on the southern TP promoted the development of agriculture and pastoralism in different ways in these regions, suggesting that the development of prehistoric human societies remained heavily dependent on regional climatic conditions. This study has important implications for understanding the relationship between environmental changes and human activities on the TP, and it helps address the challenges posed by future climate change, as well as contributing to China's "Belt and Road" initiative.

Ecosystem functions of mid-lake stands of common reed in Lake Poygan, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Mid-lake stands of common reed grass (Phragmites australis) have persisted in the shallow Winnebago Pool Lakes of east-central Wisconsin for more than 65 years. Previous research documented that the stands are declining in area with losses up to 94%. Our goal was to characterize the ecological functions of these stands, in part to assess the implications of their loss. To do so, we studied the common reed stands of Lake Poygan during summer, 1999. Common reed stands stabilized the silty/sandy substrate. Wind velocity and wave action were reduced on the downwind sides, and fine, organic sediment accumulated leeward relative to summer prevailing winds. Water clarity was greater on the leeward side. Within stands, dissolved oxygen was less variable, and temperature tended to be cooler. The 18 species of associated aquatic plants covered three or more times the area in the leeward side than windward side. Twenty-nine species of fish were found using the perimeter of the common reed stands. We expect that stand loss will be accompanied by loss of associated wetland vegetation, and the unique combination of habitat attributes afforded by these stands. The current conditions leeward of the stands suggest that stand loss will have a broader spatial effect on ecological characteristics, including fish populations, and thus the implications may be lakewide.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2011	26	2					217	229		10.1080/02705060.2011.555202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.555202													WOS:000292949200008

In situ incubations at ambient Hg concentrations indicated that the net flux of methyl-Hg from the layer was between 50 and 100 pmol/m(2)*d. This input was sufficient to account for the summer accumulation of methyl-Kg in the entire hypolimnion and it exceeded atmospheric inputs by 2 orders of magnitude. Maximum rates of net methylation occurred in the same region of the water column where we observed maximum rates of sulfate reduction. The measured rates were: 100 fmol methyl-Hg/L*d and 90 nmol SO4/L*d. Sulfate reducing enrichment cultures isolated from the hypolimnion were also able to methylate Hg in the laboratory. Sulfate reduction did not occur in anoxic profundal sediments during summer and we infer from ancillary data that methylation in profundal sediments was also low. Whole-lake rates of sulfate reduction in the hypolimnetic layer and shallow sediments were roughly equivalent, but we cannot yet compare methylation rates at these sites due to large uncertainties in the littoral flux of methyl-Hg. We propose that zones of Hg methylation and SO4 reduction follow the oxic/anoxic boundary in both the watercolumn and sediments. The relative importance of watercolumn and sediment processes will depend on the physical and chemical structure of a given lake.

Diet and bioenergetics of lake-rearing juvenile Chinook salmon in Lake Washington	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Use of lake habitats by ocean-type Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is rare under natural conditions. We studied aspects of the trophic ecology of naturally and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon rearing in the littoral zone of highly urbanized Lake Washington in Washington State. During February through May, naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon occupied littoral habitats and consumed mostly epibenthic prey, primarily chironomid pupae (Diptera). In June, they switched to a diet dominated by plankton. specifically Daphnia spp. This diet shift from littoral prey to limnetic prey coincided with increasing temperature, a shift by the fish from littoral to linmetic habitats, the spring bloom of Daphnia, and increasing fish size. Bioenergetics modeling for these populations estimated that naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon had high consumption rates and were generally feeding close to their maximum ration, even after large numbers of hatchery-produced Chinook salmon entered the lake. The feeding rates, growth rates, and proportions of maximum daily ration from the modeling suggested that under current conditions, both naturally produced and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon were finding ample food in littoral habitats of Lake Washington. These results further reveal that hatchery-produced Chinook salmon did not compete with naturally produced fish and that this was probably a result of hatchery juveniles entering the lake during the spring Daphnia bloom when this prey is abundant. Our results suggest that managers should focus Chinook salmon recovery efforts in the Lake Washington basin on other aspects of the species' lake use, such as predation or disease. or on other life stages (e.g., spawning adults).																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2006	135	6					1580	1591		10.1577/T05-178.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-178.1													WOS:000243345500014

The glacial lakes are classified into six types based on their seasonal variations in area: stable, increasing, decreasing, appearing, vanishing, and short-lived. We then track the number of each type in a given year and examine how each number changes from one year to the next. We find that many appearing, vanishing, and short-lived types occurred in both mountain ranges, having a large variability in number that is not directly related to the local short-term summer temperature anomaly, nor to precipitation or glacier recession. However, those in the Teskey Range vary significantly more than those in the Kungoy Range. To determine if the changing number and distribution of the various lake types may be due to changes in ground ice, we apply differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) analysis using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 for the debris landforms behind which glacial lakes appear. In the Teskey Range, ground ice occurs in 416 out of a total of 557 debris landforms, whereas in the Kungoy Range, ground ice occurs in 71 out of 131. In zones with predominant glacier-retreat during 1971-2010 (from Corona KH-4B and ALOS/PRISM), the Teskey Range had 180 new lake depressions as potential lake-basins, whereas the Kungoy Range had just 22. Existing depressions also expanded when melting ice produced subsidence. Such subsidence, together with debris landforms containing ground ice and ice tunnels, appear to cause the observed large number variability. In particular, the deposition of ice and debris by tunnel collapse or the freezing of storage water in a debris landform may close-off an ice tunnel, causing a lake to appear. Subsequent re-opening via melting of such blockage would produce either a vanishing or a short-lived type. In this way, the large variability in the number of each lake type and the distribution of types over this four-year period arises from regional geomorphological conditions and not directly from the local short-term summer temperature anomaly and precipitation or glacier recession.					; Daiyrov, Mirlan/AAH-8589-2019; Kääb, Andreas/AAG-8769-2020	Yamanokuchi, Tsutomu/0000-0001-9333-682X; Kaab, Andreas/0000-0002-6017-6564; Daiyrov, Mirlan/0000-0002-1489-5090; 														2076-3263				MAR	2018	8	3							99	10.3390/geosciences8030099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8030099													WOS:000428667800021

Nitrous oxide sinks and emissions in boreal aquatic networks in Quebec	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Inland waters are important sites of nitrogen processing(1,2), and represent a significant component of the global budget of nitrous oxide(3), a powerful greenhouse gas(4). Measurements have focused on nitrogen-rich temperate rivers, with low-nitrogen freshwater systems at high latitudes receiving less attention. Here we measured surface water nitrous oxide partial pressures and calculated fluxes across 321 rivers, lakes and ponds in three boreal regions of Quebec, Canada. Fluxes to the atmosphere ranged from -23.1 to 115.7 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), with high variability among ecosystem types, regions and seasons. Surprisingly, over 40% of the systems sampled were under-saturated in nitrous oxide during the summer, and one region's aquatic network was a net atmospheric sink. Fluxes could not be predicted from the relatively narrow range in nitrogen concentrations, but the aquatic systems acting as sinks tended to have lower pH, higher dissolved organic carbon and lower oxygen concentrations. Given the large variability in observed fluxes, we estimate that high-latitude aquatic networks may emit from -0.07 to 0.20 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). The potential of boreal aquatic networks to act as net atmospheric nitrous oxide sinks highlights the extensive uncertainty in our understanding of global freshwater nitrous oxide budgets.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Maranger, Roxane/HLH-6435-2023	Maranger, Roxane/0000-0002-2509-4678; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; 													1752-0894	1752-0908				FEB	2016	9	2					116	+		10.1038/NGEO2611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2611													WOS:000369324600014

OCEANOLOGIA												The aim of this work was to find out whether the difference between the central Vistula Lagoon (the southern Baltic Sea) and the western lagoon was reflected in the relationships between nutrients and phytoplankton during one-day hot summer conditions when the water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. Significant differences in Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP) and Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and also in the biomass of the dominant phytoplankton assemblage of Cyanoprokaryota, were noted in the studied parts of the lagoon. No such differences were found for the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P) or for the biomasses of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. The very low values of N:P (on average 2.8 and 3.4) indicated strong nitrogen limitation. The Correspondence Canonical Analysis (CCA) showed that the central part of the lagoon could be defined as positively related to DIN and to N:P, and western part could be characterized by correlation with temperature, dissolved oxygen and SRP concentrations. Competition for the limited resources of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen in the western, shallower part of the lagoon was in favour of Cyanoprokaryota, to the detriment of other phytoplankton assemblages. In contrast, the Cyanoprokaryota biomass in the central part of the lagoon, where DIN concentrations were increased, was lower, and Bacillariophyta in particular prospered at their expense. Here, the competition for Soluble Reactive Phosphorus was not so clear-cut. (C) 2016 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Case study comparison between litigated and voluntary nutrient management strategies	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The impairment of surface water quality in the United States has been well documented, as has the potential for agriculture to contribute nutrients that accelerate this impairment. In response, widespread implementation of conservation strategies to reduce nutrient losses and mitigate impairment has occurred. This study reports and compares the outcomes of voluntary and litigated conservation and nutrient management strategies in watersheds of Lake Erie and northwest Arkansas, respectively. In the Maumee (MRW) and Sandusky River Watersheds (SRW) that drain into Lake Erie, voluntary strategies to reduce total phosphorus (P) loading from cropland were implemented in the mid-1980s.The strategies focused on reducing particulate P loading through erosion control programs, utilizing no-till and reduced-till management.As various subsidies became available, as well as improved planters and better herbicides, farmers rapidly adopted conservation tillage. Between 1975 and 1995, this led to a decline in fertilizer and manure application and increased conservation tillage acreage, which contributed to a reduction in total and dissolved P export. In the last 10 years, however, increased no-till acres with surface soil P stratification, fall and winter broadcasting of P fertilizer, and more extreme rainfall-runoff events have contributed to an increase in dissolved P export. In the Eucha-Spavinaw Watershed (ESW), northwest Arkansas, litigation required a minimum of 33% of the poultry litter produced be exported out of ESW and the remaining land applications to be based on the risk of P runoff. Use of the Eucha-Spavinaw P Index (ESPI) has decreased the land application of poultry litter from an average 5.6 t ha(-1) (2.5 tn ac(-1)) before litigation to 2.5 t ha(-1) (1.12 tn ac(-1)) in 2009. This, combined with the fact that 70% to 80% of the produced litter was being transported out of ESW, has greatly reduced the risk of P loss in agricultural runoff. At 2009 fertilizer prices, the loss of P and nitrogen (N) from cropped acres in MRW and SRW was US$13 ha(-1) (US$5 ac(-1)), and the value of P and N exported in litter from ESW was US$40 ha(-1) (US$16 ac(-1)).While voluntary implementation of BMPs in Lake Erie watersheds decreased total P export, continued monitoring is needed to adaptively manage these BMPs to ensure their long-term effectiveness. Litigated BMP adoption in northwest Arkansas did reduce land application of litter but at a cost to beef grazing operations, which are symbiotic to poultry operations and had been using litter as a low-cost source of N and P.																			0022-4561					SEP-OCT	2012	67	5					442	450		10.2489/jswc.67.5.442	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.67.5.442													WOS:000314072900017
J	Beylich, AA; Kolstrup, E; Thyrsted, T; Gintz, D				Beylich, AA; Kolstrup, E; Thyrsted, T; Gintz, D			Water chemistry and its diversity in relation to local factors in the Latnjavagge drainage basin, arctic-oceanic Swedish Lapland	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The chemistry of precipitation, snow pack and surface water has been analysed on 205 samples collected during the 2001 field season at 25 selected sites within the Latnjavagge drainage basin in arctic-oceanic northern Swedish Lapland. Additionally, daily discharge and yield of dissolved solids have been calculated for several subcatchments and the entire Latnjavagge catchment during the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Chemical water analysis included the components Ca2+, Mg2+ Na+, K+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Cl-, NO43-, SO42- and PO43-, with SO42- and Ca2+ being the dominant ones in the surface water. Solute concentrations and chemical denudation were low, but showed significant differences within the basin. In areas of shade, longer snow cover, frozen ground and thin regolith, concentrations over the summer were perceptible but so low that solutes brought into the basin from precipitation could be detected in the surface water. In one locality, it was even found that lake water could reflect snowmelt to such an extent that the solute concentration was less than that of summer precipitation. The highest concentrations were found at a radiation-exposed, W-facing, vegetated, moderately steep slope with relatively thick regolith that was thawed at the time of snowmelt in early June. In such well-drained sites with continuous subsurface water flow, a maximum of contact between water and mineral particles could take place. The concentration values revealed differences in the rate of thawing of frozen ground between shaded areas and/or areas at higher altitude on the one hand and radiation-exposed areas on the other. A comparison with published results from Karkevagge a few kilometres to the northwest as well as from other periglacial locations indicates that the chemical denudation values from Latnjavagge are more representative of periglacial oceanic environments than the values from the Karkevagge catchment, which shows especially high chemical denudation rates. The investigation in Latnjavagge stresses the importance of spatial variability within even small catchments of homogeneous lithology as it demonstrates that solute concentrations from different subbasins can differ substantially dependent on exposure to radiation, duration of snow cover and frozen ground conditions, regolith thickness and possibly also to vegetation cover and slope angle as factors steering water turbulence and retention of drainage.

Six lakes that where limed about 10 years ago, seven acid and two neutral reference lakes, were sampled twice a year (1998 and 1999). One acid lake was limed in autumn 1998. Qualitative nethaul samples from the deepest part of the lake and from the most frequent habitat in the littoral zone were used. The limed lakes had a species composition which indicates that these lakes are about to recover. Species associated with neutral lakes dominates while acid-tolerant species were rare. The acid-sensitive species, Daphnia longispina and D. cristata, were found in the limed lakes. This study shows the usefulness of a low-cost sampling program where microcrustaceans are used as bioindicators of recovery.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1313	1318		10.1023/A:1013953806377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013953806377													WOS:000172012000067

Digenean communities in the tufted duck [Aythya fuligula (L., 1758)] and greater scaup [A. marila (L., 1761)] wintering in the north-west of Poland	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												A total of 124 specimens of the tufted duck, Aythya fuligula, and 63 greater scaup, A. marila, were examined for digenean parasites. Both duck species, which overwinter in a coastal lake connected with the southern Baltic (northwest Poland) were found to support Amblosoma exile, Cyathocotyle prussica, Paracoenogonimus ovatus, Australapatemon minor, Cotylurus cornutus, Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Echinostoma revolutum and Notocotylus attenuatus. In addition, the tufted duck hosted Hypoderaeum conoideum, Bilharziella polonica, Neoeucotyle zakharovi, Renicola mediovitellata, Psilochasmus oxyurus, Psilostomum brevicolle and Cryptocotyle concava; Echinostoma nordiana occurred in the greater scaup only. The two duck species differed significantly in the intensity and abundance of their digenean infection. Aythya marila harboured higher intensity levels and a wider assemblage of digeneans than A. fuligula, and this was likely to be due to differences in the pre-wintering exposure of the duck species to infective stages of these freshwater digeneans. Digenean communities in both duck species, strongly dominated by E. recurvatum, were relatively similar in their structure. No significant sex-dependent differences in digenean infections were revealed, except for the infection with N. attenuatus in A. fuligula. Similarly, there were no significant age-dependent differences (adult versus immature birds) in digenean infections, except for that with N. attenuatus in A. fuligula. The structural similarity between digenean communities in the two duck species is most likely an effect of overlapping diets based on freshwater molluscs, components of the digenean transmission pathway to definitive hosts.

Diurnal variations of dissolved and colloidal organic carbon and trace metals in a boreal lake during summer bloom	WATER RESEARCH												This work describes variation of element concentration in surface water of a subarctic organic-rich lake during the diurnal cycle of photosynthesis. An unusually hot summer 2010 in European part of subarctic Russia produced elevated surface water temperature (28 -30 degrees C) and caused massive cyanobacterial bloom. Diurnal variation of similar to 40 dissolved macro and trace elements and organic carbon were recorded in the humic Lake Svyatoe in the White Sea drainage basin. Two days continuous measurements with 3 h sampling steps at the surface (0.5 m) allowed tracing cyanobacterial activity via pH and O-2 measurement and revealed constant concentrations (within +/- 20-30%) of all major elements (Na, Mg, Cl, SO4, K, Ca), organic and inorganic carbon and most trace elements (Li, B, Sc, Ti, Ni, Cu, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Sb, medium and heavy REEs, Hf, Pb, Th, U). The concentration of Mn demonstrated a factor of 3 decrease during the day following Mn adsorption onto cyanobacterial cells due to similar to 1 pH unit raise during the photosynthesis and Mn release during the night due to desorption from the cell surface. The role of Mn(II) photo-oxidation by reactive oxygen species could be also pronounced, although its contribution to Mn diurnal variation was much smaller than the adsorption at the cell surfaces. Similar pattern, but with much lesser variations (c.a., 10-20%), was recorded for Ba and Fe. On-site ultrafiltration technique allowed to distinguish between low molecular weight (LMW) complexes (<1 kDa) and high molecular weight (HMW) colloids (1 kDa -0.22 mu m) and to assess their diurnal pattern. Colloidal Al and Fe were the highest during the night, when the contribution of HMW allochthonous colloids was maximal. Typical insoluble trivalent and tetravalent elements exhibited constant complexation (>80-90%) with HMW allochthonous organics, independent on the diel photosynthetic cycle. Finally, biologically-relevant metals (Cu, Co, Cr, V, and Ni) demonstrated significant variations of colloidal fractions (from 10 to 60%) not directly related to the photosynthesis. The majority of possible metal nutrients, being strongly associated with organic and organo-mineral colloids do not exhibit any measurable concentration variation during photosynthesis. The two types of element behavior during cyanobacterial bloom in the water column constant concentration and sinusoidal variations - likely depend on element speciation in solution and their relative affinity to surfaces of aquatic microorganisms and complexation with authochthonous and allochthonous organic matter.

Microbial Community Dynamics During Lake Ice Freezing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Many freshwater environments experience dramatic seasonal changes with some systems remaining ice-covered for most of the winter. Freshwater systems are also highly sensitive to environmental change. However, little is known about changes in microbial abundance and community composition during lake ice formation and times of persistent ice cover. The goal of this study is to characterize temporal dynamics of microbial communities during ice formation and persistent ice cover. Samples were collected in triplicate, five days per week from surface water in the Keweenaw Waterway between November and April. Environmental conditions along with microbial abundance and microbial community composition was determined. Distinct community composition was found between ice-free and ice-covered time periods with significantly different community composition between months. The microbial community underwent dramatic shifts in microbial abundance and diversity during the transitions into and out of ice cover. The richness of the microbial community increased during times of ice cover. Relatives of microbes involved in nitrogen cycling bloomed during times of ice cover as sequences related to known nitrifying taxa were significantly enriched during ice cover. These results help to elucidate how microbial abundance and diversity change over drastic seasonal transitions and how ice cover may affect microbial abundance and diversity.

Nevertheless, the provenance of lithium in salt lakes has always been controversial. The lithium and boron (Li and B) isotopes, which serve as discerning geochemical tracers, can facilitate the monitoring of geological processes and sources. In this study, we investigated the hydrochemistry, Li and B isotope characteristics of surface brine and recharge river samples collected from the Lakko Co on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The dissolved Li concentrations range from 0.11 to 590.8 mg/L, delta 7Li and delta 11B values exhibit a range of 0.75-8.11 %o and -18.29--4.01 %o, respectively. Concentrations of elements such as Rb, and Cu are relatively high and exhibit a strong correlation with Li. Ions composition and content ratios indicate the deep origin of Li and B. The analysis of delta 7Li and delta 11B suggests that, apart from hot spring, weathering of surrounding rocks also contributes to the presence of Li and B. Besides, variations in delta 11B values within the lake brine analysis may be attributed to the deposition of water Magnesite at the lake bottom. The findings suggest that the recharge water system and hot springs serve as the primary source of Li and B in Lakko Co. Additionally, the interaction between water and rock in the deep crust as well as chemical weathering in the shallow environment, significantly contribute to formation of Li-rich fluids. The transportation process is characterized by the precipitation of secondary mineral, resulting in an increase of delta 7Li and delta 11B. Furthermore, the presence of water Magnesite in the lake brine leads to fluctuations in delta 11B. This investigation of the lake contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the origins and mechanisms involved in the transportation and storage of lithium in lithium-rich salt lakes.					he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022; LI, ZHENGYAN/KCY-9486-2024; Wang, Dawei/GYA-0034-2022	he, maoyong/0000-0002-9545-5037													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2024	630								130714	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130714		JAN 2024											WOS:001172488200001
J	Bartosová, S; Jurajda, P				Bartosová, S; Jurajda, P			A comparison of 0+fish communities in borrow pits under different flooding regime	FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												In 1997 and 1998, the 0+ fish communities of eight borrow pits along the River Dyje (Danube basin) were investigated by electrofishing using point-abundance sampling. The unusually large summer flood in 1997 resulted in inundation of the whole floodplain area during July and August. Fifteen fish species were recorded. The most abundant species were Abramis bioerkna and Carassius gibelio. Despite the inundation connecting all borrow pits in July, the composition of 0+ fish assemblages was not homogenous among the pools. According to the distribution of the dominant species, the borrow pits were divided into two groups A. bjoerkna dominated in five and C. gibelio dominated in three. The extensive summer flood in 1997 had positive influence for fish assemblages in the study area. In 1998 there was no natural flood, however, some study sites were artificially flooded. The composition of 0+ fish communities in 1998 was different to that 1997. We registered only eight species of 0+ fish, with Perca fluviatilis the most abundant species. CPUE was lower in 1998 than in 1997. These results suggest that artificial flooding, if short term, may not confer any benefits to the 0+ fish community. However, prolonged flooding, as in 1997, can have a positive benefit.

Sediment Diatom Species and Community Response to Nitrogen Addition in Oregon (USA) Estuarine Tidal Wetlands	WETLANDS												Sediment microalgae play an important role in nutrient cycling and are important primary producers in the food web in Pacific Northwest estuaries. This study examines the effects of nitrogen addition to benthic microalgae in tidal wetlands of Yaquina Bay estuary on the Oregon coast, USA. Liquid nitrogen fertilizers (0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 gN/m(2)/wk during the first year of the study, and increased to 0, 15.6, 62.5, and 156 gN/m(2)/wk during the second year of the study) were applied weekly to four salt marshes in Yaquina Bay for two summers (2009 and 2010). Diatom species and community parameters were analyzed in response to nitrogen addition in early and late summer 2010. Nitrogen addition (N) had a significant effect on species composition and community parameters. Amphora spp. and Nitzschia palea were more dominant with higher N, while Navicula gregaria and Navicula phyllepta were more dominant with lower N. Species diversity and richness were significantly higher (p < 0.05) with lower N (3.1 +/- 0.1; 40.0 +/- 3.3) compared with higher N (2.4 +/- 0.5; 34.5 +/- 3.0). NMDS ordination displayed shifts in overall diatom assemblage with time and with N. Results suggest the microalgal communities are limited by nitrogen levels and therefore may be susceptible to changes in nitrogen loading to these systems.					; Hankin, Shanon/HMW-1637-2023	DeWitt, Theodore/0000-0002-8410-1452; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2012	32	6					1023	1031		10.1007/s13157-012-0332-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-012-0332-6													WOS:000311540400004

The potential for beach sand to serve as a reservoir for Escherichia coli and the physical influences on cell die-off	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: The Escherichia coli burden at a Great Lakes urban beach was evaluated during the summer months to determine if sand served as a reservoir for E. coli, and if there was evidence of cell replication in situ. Field and laboratory studies investigated the effects of moisture, temperature and UV on E. coli densities in the sand. Methods and Results: Sand samples (n = 481) were collected across three distinct transects of the beach, the top, a middle streamline, and the berm, over 15 sample days. The highest levels were found in the middle streamline, which was affected by stormwater discharge from nearby outfalls and roosting gulls; daily geometric mean levels of these seven sites ranged from 6700 to 40 900 CFU per 100 g of sand. Escherichia coli levels were greatest in samples with moisture levels between 15% and 19%, and were significantly higher than 0-4 and 20-24% ranges (P < 0.05). Pre- and post-rain samples at the beach demonstrated an increase in E. coli levels nearly 100-fold within 30 min, suggesting sand washout as a major mechanism for loading of E. coli into the beach waters. Rep PCR analysis of 160 isolates obtained from eight sites demonstrated that 21% of the isolates fell into one of the six clonal patterns, suggesting that bacteria may be able to replicate and possibly colonize beach sand. Sand field plots inoculated with E. coli cells containing pGFPuv that expresses GFP (green fluorescent protein) as a marker showed an initial two- to 100-fold increase at 24 h, depending on the temperature condition. The sand appeared to provide considerable protection from UV exposure as no significant difference was seen in cell densities within the first 2-4 cm of sand between exposed and unexposed plots (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Beach sand may act as a reservoir for E. coli. Replication of cells appears to be one possible contributing factor to the persistently high levels, as indicated by both field studies and laboratory studies, and warrants further investigation. Moisture content of sand may also be a determinant of cell persistence in the sand environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Escherichia coli is used as an indicator organism for faecal pollution at most Great Lakes coastal beaches; therefore, a better understanding of how E. coli might survive, or possibly replicate, in the environment would improve interpretation of beach monitoring results.

The CHS comprises of beach ridges, inter-ridge swales, sand dunes, tidal channels and fluvial deposits. We present the first documentation of the spatial distribution and the intemal architecture of the CHS based on topographic surveys, sediment percussive coring, trenching and ground penetrating radar (GPR) transects. Radiocarbon dating on marine shells from foreshore deposits of 8 representative beach ridges yielded ages between 4800 and 270 cal. years BP at respective distances of 4800 to 670 m from the present shoreline. We interpret the boundary between the foreshore (beach) and the foredune deposits as indicator of past sea levels by analogy to present shore processes. This boundary is readily recognizable in sediment profiles from cores and trenches as well as GPR reflectors. Based on the age model and depositional features, we estimate relative sea level fall of up to 15 m over the past 4800 years. Considering that the eustatic sea level changes for this period are negligible for the Makran coast, this relative sea level fall is related to tectonic uplift across the coastal Makran. The elevation of palaeo-shorelines with similar ages decrease from east to west of the CHS, which suggest that alongshore variations in uplift rates are likely related to different movements of coastal fault blocks.

The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau contains huge geothermal resources; especially, Li-rich geothermal resources in southern Xizang, southwestern China, are widely developed. The Li-rich geothermal spots in Xizang are mainly distributed on both sides and to the south of the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone. Such resources are often found in the intensely active high-temperature Li-rich geothermal fields and, compared with other Li-rich geothermal fields around the world, the Li-rich geothermal fluid in the Xizang Plateau, southern Xizang is characterized by good quality: the highest reported Li concentration is up to 239 mg/L; the Mg/Li ratio is extremely low and ranges from 0.03 to 1.48 for most of the Li-rich geothermal fluid; the Li/TDS value is relatively high and ranges from 0.25-1.14% compared to Zhabuye Li-rich salt lake (0.19%) and Salar de Uyuni (Bolivia) (0.08-0.31%). Continuous discharge has been stable for at least several decades, and some of them reach industrial grades of salt lake brine (32.74 mg/L). In addition, elements such as boron (B), caesium (Cs), and rubidium (Rb) are rich and can be comprehensively utilized. Based on still-incomplete statistics, there are at least 16 large-scale Li-rich hot springs with lithium concentration of 20 mg/L or more. The total discharge of lithium metal is about 4300 tons per year, equivalent to 25,686 tons of lithium carbonate. Drilling data has shown that the depth is promising and there is a lack of volcanism (non-volcanic geothermal system). With a background of the partial-melting lower crust caused by the collision of the Indo-Asia continent and based on a comprehensive analysis of the tectonic background of southern Xizang and previous geological, geophysical, and geothermal research, deep molten magma seems to provide a stable heat source for the high-temperature Li-rich geothermal field. The Li-rich parent geothermal fluid rushes to the surface to form hot springs along the extensively developed tectonic fault zones in southern Xizang; some of the Li-rich fluid flows in to form Li-rich salt lakes. However, most of the Li-rich geothermal fluid is remitted to seasonal rivers and has not been effectively exploited, resulting in great waste. With the continuous advance of lithium extraction technologies in Li-rich geothermal fluid, the lithium resource in geothermal water is promising as a new geothermal type of mineral deposit, which can be effectively exploited. This is the first study to undertake a longitudinal analysis on the characteristics, distribution and scale, origin and utilization prospects of Li-rich geothermal resources in southern Xizang, research that will contribute to a deeper understanding of Li-rich geothermal resources in the area and attract attention to these resources in China.					wang, chenguang/AAE-4990-2020														1000-9515	1755-6724				JUN	2021	95	3					860	872		10.1111/1755-6724.14675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14675													WOS:000667267600011

J	Mattsson, HB; Höskuldsson, A				Mattsson, Hannes B.; Hoskuldsson, Armann			Contemporaneous phreatomagmatic and effusive activity along the Hverfjall eruptive fissure, north Iceland: Eruption chronology and resulting deposits	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					3rd International Maar Conference (3IMC)	APR 14-17, 2009	Malargue, ARGENTINA					The 2500 BP Hverfjall eruption in northern Iceland produced pyroclastic and effusive deposits of widely different characteristics along the length of the eruptive fissure. The southern half of the fissure was located in a shallow lake, whereas the northern part of the fissure extended onto dry land. This specific setting, with overlapping periods of activity at the different vents, resulted in various mingling features between fine-grained phreatomagmatic deposits and lava flows. Here we reconstruct the course of events during this eruption based on field observations and granulometric analyses of the resulting deposits. The eruption can be divided into three main phases depending on the main depositional characteristics and vent locations. The initial phase is dominated by phreatomagmatic fall deposits which are attributed to an overall high eruption rate in a shallow lacustrine setting. The second phases involved opening of two new vents on dry ground, and deposition of scoria and lava flows. The third and final phase of the eruption is associated with a lowering of the eruption rate in the southernmost vent, with a shift in the activity from continuous uprush and fall deposits to discrete explosions and emplacement of base surges. These surges display features consistent with drying up with increasing distance from the vent, suggesting that their dynamics changed during emplacement. Most wet surges were channelized within a preexisting graben structure close to the vent, but some more dilute (i.e., dry) surges were able to flow over this obstacle and continued to flow for more than 5 km away from the vent and 100 m uphill before stopping.

Recent studies focused on gut bacterial diversity in birds and poultry, with little information about the ecological functions of their gut fungal community. Methods The high-throughput sequencing was applied to compare intestinal fungal community structure between Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) and Domestic Goose (Anser anser domesticus), and infer the potential pathogens of each species at Shengjin Lake of China. Results Intestinal fungal alpha diversity was higher in Hooded Crane than Greylag Goose (Anser anser). Gut fungal community composition showed dramatic shifts between the two species. Hooded Cranes mainly eat Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton malaianus, while artificial hurl food (i.e., paddy) was the main food resource for Domestic Geese, suggesting that the variations in fungal community might be induced by different diets between the two hosts. Two enriched genera (i.e., Acremonium and Rhodotorula) which could increase host's digestion were detected in guts of Hooded Cranes. In addition, there were 42 pathogenic amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), 17% of which shared in Hooded Crane and Greylag Goose. The Hooded Crane had higher gut fungal pathogenic diversity and abundance relative to Greylag Goose. Conclusions The study demonstrated that divergence in intestinal fungal community structure might be induced by different diets between wintering Hooded Crane and Domestic Goose. Hooded Crane might rely more on their gut fungal taxa to acquire nutrients from indigestible food resources. Our study also implied that more research should focus on intestinal pathogens in wild birds and domestic poultry, as they might increase risk of disease in other animals, even human beings. The degree of cross infection in pathogens among wild birds and sympatric poultry should be clearly verified in future study.

J	Specht, NF; Claussen, M; Kleinen, T				Specht, Nora Farina; Claussen, Martin; Kleinen, Thomas			Dynamic interaction between lakes, climate, and vegetation across northern Africa during the mid-Holocene	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												During the early Holocene to mid-Holocene, about 11 500 to 5500 years ago, lakes expanded across the Sahel and Sahara in response to enhanced summer monsoon precipitation. To investigate the effect of these lakes on the West African summer monsoon, previous simulation studies prescribed mid-Holocene lakes from reconstructions. By prescribing mid-Holocene lakes, however, the terrestrial water balance is inconsistent with the size of the lakes. In order to close the terrestrial water cycle, we construct a dynamic endorheic lake (DEL) model and implement it into the atmosphere-land model ICON-JSBACH4. For the first time, this allows us to investigate the dynamic interaction between climate, lakes, and vegetation across northern Africa. Additionally, we investigate the effect of lake depth changes on mid-Holocene precipitation, a neglected aspect in previous simulation studies.A pre-industrial control simulation shows that the DEL model realistically simulates the lake extent across northern Africa. Only in the Ahnet and Chotts basins is the lake area slightly overestimated, which is likely related to the coarse resolution of the simulations. The mid-Holocene simulations reveal that both the lake expansion and the vegetation expansion cause a precipitation increase over northern Africa. The sum of these individual contributions to the precipitation is, however, larger than the combined effect that is generated when lake and vegetation dynamics interact. Thus, the lake-vegetation interaction causes a relative drying response across the entire Sahel. The main reason for this drying response is that the simulated vegetation expansion cools the land surface more strongly than the lake expansion, which is dominated by the expansion of Lake Chad. Accordingly, the surface temperature increases over the region of Lake Chad and causes local changes in the meridional surface-temperature gradient. These changes in the meridional surface-temperature gradient are associated with reduced inland moisture transport from the tropical Atlantic into the Sahel, which causes a drying response in the Sahel. An idealized mid-Holocene experiment shows that a similar drying response is induced when the depth of Lake Chad is decreased by about 1-5 m, without changing the horizontal lake area. By reducing the depth of Lake Chad, the heat storage capacity of the lake decreases, and the lake warms faster during the summer months. Thus, in the ICON-JSBACH4 model, the lake depth significantly influences the simulated surface temperature and the simulated meridional surface-temperature gradient between the simulated lakes and vegetation, thereby affecting mid-Holocene precipitation over northern Africa.					; Kleinen, Thomas/G-5666-2018	Claussen, Martin/0000-0001-6225-5488; Kleinen, Thomas/0000-0001-9550-5164													1814-9324	1814-9332				JUL 25	2024	20	7					1595	1613		10.5194/cp-20-1595-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1595-2024													WOS:001275491800001

Increasing air temperature relative to water temperature makes the mixed layer shallower, reducing phytoplankton biomass in a stratified lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The depth of the mixed layer is a major determinant of nutrient and light availability for phytoplankton in stratified waterbodies. Ongoing climate change influences surface waters through meteorological forcing, which modifies the physical structure of fresh waters including the mixed layer, but effects on phytoplankton biomass are poorly known. To determine the responses of phytoplankton biomass to the depth of the mixed layer, light availability and associated meteorological forcing, we followed daily changes in weather and water column properties in a boreal lake over the first half of a summer stratification period. Phytoplankton biomass increased with the deepening of the mixed layer associated with high wind speeds and low air temperature relative to the temperature of the mixed layer (T-air-T-mix < 0), whereas heatwave conditions-shallow mixed layer driven by high T-air-T-mix value and low wind speed-reduced the biomass. Improving light availability from low to moderate light conditions increased the phytoplankton biomass, while the highest light availability was associated with low phytoplankton biomass. Our study demonstrates that the climatic impact-drivers wind speed and T-air-T-mix are major drivers of mixed layer depth, which controlled phytoplankton biomass during the early summer stratification period. Our study suggests that increasing air temperature relative to water temperature and declining wind speeds have potential to lead to reduced phytoplankton biomass due to a shallower mixed layer during the first half of the stratification period in non-eutrophic lakes with sufficient light availability.

In recent years, exploitation of potash resources accompanied by leakage of underground brines (UB) in potassium-bearing strata has threatened mining safety. However, there is little research on origin of UB in Laos. In this study, twelve samples of UB, salt springs (SS) and river waters were collected in Khammouane mining area, central Laos and analyzed for ionic and boron isotopic compositions. The results show that both of UB, dominated by K+, Mg2+, Na+ and Cl- ions, and SS, enriched in Na+ and Cl-, are chloride-type brines, while river waters abundant in Ca2+ and HC ions are carbonate-type waters. K+ (35.1-53.7 g/L) and Rb+ (12.9-16.6 mg/L) concentrations of UB are higher than the peak (25.9 g/L, 9.4 mg/L) of seawater evaporation trajectories (SET). UB is also characterized by high Mg2+ (32.7-68.0 g/L) and Br- (1795.2-2801.3 mg/L) concentrations and its lg(Cl/Br) ratios (1.9-2.1) deviate from the halite dissolution line. These comparisons indicate that the water chemistries of UB are mainly influenced by dissolution of carnallite and sylvite. High Sr2+ concentrations (31.8-58.6 mg/L) in UB might be simultaneously associated with dissolution of potash salt and Ca-bearing minerals (carbonate and anhydrite). The negative saturation indices (SI) of different salt minerals in UB suggest that salt minerals are unsaturated in UB. Meanwhile, boron (B) concentrations (396.0-426.0 mg/L) and delta B-11 values (+19.8-+21.0%) of UB fall in between low B-delta B-11 end member (0.02 mg/L, +2.31%) of river water and high B-delta B-11 end member (126.7-890.8 mu g/g, +25.94-+32.94%) of evaporitic minerals. The comparison implies that UB was influenced and mixed by two end members. Therefore, combining with major and trace ionic concentrations, isotopic compositions and lithologies of salt-bearing strata revealed by drillings in mining area, we conclude that the major solute source in UB is derived from dissolution of carnallite and sylvite. These geochemical evidences provide insights into dealing with leakage of underground brines occurred in the underground mining of potash deposits in Laos.

Occurrence of lacustrine carbonates is a function of lake-basin type, in this case a volcanically mediated balanced-filled lake basin that contains various lithofacies: microbialite, grainstone, packstone, wackestone, and carbonate mudstone. Distribution of lithofacies is strongly controlled by depositional sub environment and gradient (through water depth, bottom energy, circulation, and accommodation). Internal character of microbialites (i.e., type, size, porosity, vertical and horizontal permeability, associated lithotypes, diagenesis) is influenced by stratal position (at the parasequence scale) and location along the depositional profile. Depositional reservoir quality characteristics, such as microbialite porosity and thickness, grainstone size and sorting, and overall carbonate continuity and connectivity peak in the medial sublittoral zone. Conversely, secondary diagenetic effects, such as dissolution, carbonate and quartz cement, and possible authigenic clays, are highest in the updip lake-plain littoral zones and are less common lakeward. Thus, the medial sublittoral zone has the optimum potential, where primary depositional characteristics are best developed, and negative secondary diagenetic effects are minimal. These strata share many attributes with the Cretaceous presalt systems of the south Atlantic and can provide insights about controls on potential reservoir character, distribution, and connectivity for exploration and development.

J	Thompson, PA; Waite, AM; McMahon, K				Thompson, PA; Waite, AM; McMahon, K			Dynamics of a cyanobacterial bloom in a hypereutrophic, stratified weir pool	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In summer 1997-1998, a bloom of the cyanobacteria Anabaena circinalis (Rabenhorst) and Anabaena spiroides (Klebahn) contaminated the Canning River (Perth, WA), forcing its closure to the public for swimming and fishing. We investigated the major nutrient fluctuations before, during and after the bloom. The river was persistently temperature stratified at least 1 month prior to the bloom. The surface and bottom layers of water had distinctly different nutrient concentrations, which meant that biomass and growth rates of the phytoplankton within each layer were limited by different nutrients. At the peak of the bloom, in the bottom waters growth rates were light limited and biomass was nitrogen limited, whereas in the surface waters biomass was controlled by phosphorus (P) availability and growth rates were probably limited by the lack of dissolved inorganic carbon. Another consequence of stratification was that, at the peak of the bloom (0.25 mg chlorophyll L-1), the mostly buoyant cyanobacteria could not access 83% of the P released from sediments during the summer period of anoxia. In this situation, the injection of oxygenated water, tested as a remediation measure for algal blooms, is likely to exacerbate a bloom by providing more of the limiting nutrient to the surface layer. However, aeration prior to the bloom may reduce P release from the sediments by preventing anoxia.

A multivariable empirical orthogonal function (MVEOF) was employed to extract the thermal-pressure coupled ISV mode. Our results show that the geopotential height and air temperature over the NCCV active region exhibit a statis-tically significant intraseasonal periodicity of 20-60 days. The dominant ISV mode features a westward-propagated zonal dipole pattern, which is generated over the Lake Baikal region and triggered by intraseasonal wave energy accumulation. By dividing the ISV cycle into eight phases, it is found that more NCCVs with a large scope occur in phases 5-8 than those in phases 1-4. The positive (negative) geopotential height and air temperature tendencies in phases 1-4 (5-8) act to sup-press (facilitate) the NCCV activity. The thermodynamic tendency budget and scale decomposition reveal that when an anomalous intraseasonal cyclonic circulation propagates westward from Lake Baikal to the Ural Mountains, the anomalous southwesterly transports mean negative vorticity from the north side of the Tibetan Plateau to Northeast Asia and trans-ports mean warm air temperature from low latitudes to high latitudes, leading to the positive geopotential height and air temperature tendencies and thereby restraining the NCCV activity. The opposite is also true for the facilitation of the NCCV modulated by the negative geopotential height and air temperature tendencies.

Fish composition, but not richness or abundance, differ among Phragmites, Typha, and Schoenoplectus zones during a high-water year	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phragmites australis (ssp australis) is an aggressive colony-forming species that displaces emergent vegetation in North America, including native bulrushes (Schoenoplectus sp.) and both native and invasive cattails (Typha sp.). Phragmites expansion can alter habitat and negatively affect reptiles, amphibians, and birds; less is known about Phragmites' utility as fish habitat and its impact on fish communities in freshwater coastal wetlands. To assess fish use of Phragmites in summer, we compared habitat characteristics, water quality, and fish community composition, diversity, and abundance among stands of flooded Phragmites, Typha, and Schoenoplectus at 16 sites across four regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Despite marked differences in water quality (higher pH and morning dissolved oxygen in Schoenoplectus) and habitat characteristics (higher stem density in Phragmites), there were no significant differences in fish species richness or catch per unit effort among vegetation types; there was a distinct fish assemblage in Schoenoplectus (more Cyprinids) compared to both Phragmites and Typha (more Centrarchids). This suggests that expansion of Phragmites or Typha at the expense of Schoenoplectus may alter wetland fish assemblages; however, with no clear differences in other fish community metrics, flooded Phragmites may provide habitat for some fishes during the summer, in the study wetlands.

J	Belete, MD; Diekkrüger, B; Roehrig, J				Belete, Mulugeta Dadi; Diekkrueger, Bernd; Roehrig, Jackson			Linkage between Water Level Dynamics and Climate Variability: The Case of Lake Hawassa Hydrology and ENSO Phenomena	CLIMATE												Lake Hawassa is a topographically closed lake in the Central Main Ethiopian Rift Valley. The water level of this lake has been reported to dramatically rise without falling back to the original level. The cause of this rise is not yet sufficiently investigated and subjected to this study. This study argues that the general variability in the lake level and its resultant rise has significant linkage to the temperature variability at the Pacific Ocean. The linkage between water level dynamics and climate variability was analyzed through the application of diverse statistical techniques. It comprises the Mann-Kendall trend analysis to test monotonic variations over time; sequential regime shift index (RSI) to detect significant shifts in the mean values of time-series records of lake level; and coherence analysis to investigate the linear relationship between ENSO index and records of local hydrology. Despite the multiple rises and falls, the results of the trend analysis revealed that the lake level experienced a significant resultant upward trend with Mann-Kendall values of 0.558, 0.629, and 0.545 (at = 0.05 and p < 0.01%) for monthly maximum, average and minimum values respectively. The sequential regime shift evidenced that most of the significant shifts coincide with the occurrences of ENSO events. Generally, the lake level tends to be high during El Nino and low during La Nina episodes. The typical examples are the coincidence of extreme historical maximum lake level to the strongest El Nino event of the century that occurred in 1997/98 and the lowest lake level record in the year 1975 with a strong La Nina year. The coincidence of climate regime shift in the Pacific Ocean in 1976/77 with an equivalent regime shift in the lake level is an additional confirmation for the possible climate-hydrology linkage. The likely involvement of anthropogenic factors (at least in modifying the effect of climate) is justified by the interplay between the non-trending rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and trending streamflow. The coherence analysis between 492 pairs of monthly step datasets of 3.4ENSO index and lake level changes is also found to have a significant linear relationship over frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.14 cycles/month or 1.56 to 1.68 cycles/year. This corresponds to a dominant average periodicity (coincident cycle) of about 7.4 months which is thought to be related to the time span of the two rainy season in the locality.

Mass flux data indicate strong seasonal patterns, with maximum fluxes recorded during the unstratified period. The large amount of winter resuspension is a mechanism which provides an intimate coupling of recent sediments and the water column. Trap study results indicate that there is a near-bottom (10 m thick) benthic nepheloid layer whose chemical composition approaches that of deep water (fine grain) sediments. The amount of resuspended NaOH extractable P injected into the euphotic zone is estimated as approximately equal to the load of new P entering southern Lake Michigan. The role of resuspension in the cycling of organic C and contaminants associated with it appears to be important.																			0380-1330						1984	10	3					307	321		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71844-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71844-2													WOS:A1984TL80400015

From local gazetteers it becomes apparent that monastic water supply activities were enabled by the monasteries' proximity to the springs found in the hills and to the water infrastructure that served the lake as the city's freshwater reservoir. The aim of the study is to elucidate how monasteries offered freshwater from their springs to travelers and city residents, especially in times of drought, and accommodated elite members. The study will show in particular how monks made their expert knowledge in hydrological engineering available to infrastructure projects of Hangzhou's local administrators. Besides being charity-minded, monasteries were also profit-orientated as they were well-versed in fund-raising and received generous bestowments and donations, mostly exempt from taxation. What is more, they attempted to encroach on the West Lake for the cultivation of water plants, thus, however, impairing the city's freshwater supply from the reservoir that local administrators tried so hard to preserve.																			0737-769X	2050-8999				JUN	2023	51	1					1	45																WOS:001019796800001

Holocene climate variability in north-eastern Italy: potential influence of the NAO and solar activity recorded by speleothem data	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Here we present high-resolution stable isotope and lamina thickness profiles as well as radiocarbon data for the Holocene stalagmite ER 76 from Grotta di Ernesto (north-eastern Italy), which was dated by combined U-series dating and lamina counting. ER 76 grew between 8 ka (thousands of years before 2000 AD) and today, with a hiatus from 2.6 to 0.4 ka. Data from nine meteorological stations in Trentino show a significant influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on winter temperature and precipitation in the cave region. Spectral analysis of the stable isotope signals of ER 76 reveals significant peaks at periods of 110, 60-70, 40-50, 32-37 and around 25 a. Except for the cycle between 32 and 37 a all periodicities have corresponding peaks in power spectra of solar variability, and the 25-a cycle may correspond to NAO variability. This suggests that climate variability in northern Italy was influenced by both solar activity and the NAO during the Holocene. Six periods of warm winter climate in the cave region were identified. These are centred at 7.9, 7.4, 6.5, 5.5, 4.9 and 3.7 ka, and their duration ranges from 100 to 400 a. The two oldest warm phases coincide with the deposition of sapropel S1 in the Mediterranean Sea indicating that the climate in the cave region was influenced by this prominent pluvial phase in the Mediterranean area. For the younger warm phases it is difficult to establish a supra-regional climate pattern, and some of them may, thus, reflect regional climate variability. This highlights the complexity of regional and supra-regional scale Holocene climate patterns.

The purpose of this study was to clarify fluid status in persons developing AMS vs. those remaining without symptoms during simulated altitude with controlled fluid intake, diet, temperature, and without exercise. Ninety-nine exposures of 51 men and women to reduced barometric pressure (426 mmHg = 16,000 ft. = 4,880 m) were carried out for 8-12 h. AMS was evaluated by Lake Louise (LL) and AMS-C scores near the end of exposure. Serial measurements included fluid balance, electrolyte excretions, and plasma concentrations, regulating hormones, and free water clearance. Comparison between 16 subjects with the lowest AMS scores near the end of exposure ("non-AMS": mean LL = 1.0, range = 0-2.5) and 16 others with the highest AMS scores ("AMS": mean LL = 7.4, range = 5-11) demonstrated significant fluid retention in AMS beginning within the first 3 h, resulting from reduced urine flow. Plasma Na+ decreased significantly after 6 h, indicating dilution throughout the total body water. Excretion of Na+ and K+ trended downward with time in both groups, being lower in AMS after 6 h, and the urine Na+- to- K+ ratio was significantly higher for AMS after 6 h. Renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide were not different between groups, with the latter tending to rise and aldosterone falling with time of exposure. Antidiuretic hormone fell in non-AMS and rose in AMS within 90 min of exposure and continued to rise in AMS, closely associated with severity of symptoms and fluid retention.

Six plants such as Canna indica L., Scirpus tabernaemontanl Gmel., Eichornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms., Oenanthe ja vania (B1.) DC., Acorns calamus L., Phragmitas communis Trin. were planted in the two constructed wetlands in separated sections on condition that hydraulic loading was 12 cm/d, hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 3 d. The results show that the removal efficiencies of subsurface constructed wetlands on TP and TN with canna indica L. or Scirpus tabernaemontanl Geml. are stable. Removal efficiencies of the former on TN and TP are 70.60% and 88.27%, respectively. Removal efficiencies of the later on TN and TP are 73.33% and 83.87%, respectively. Removal efficiencies of the constructed wetlands with Acorns calamus L. and Phragmitas communis Trin., the removal efficiencies of TN are 71.73% and 74.33%, respectively, and removal efficiencies of TP are unstable. The subsurface wetland of Eichornia ciassipes (Mart.) Solms. and Phragmitas communis Trin. on removal of TP and TN in summer or fall are more efficient. The two types of constructed wetlands have good effect on the removal of COD, which are above 78%, and the effluent concentration of CODcr is less than 57 mg/L.

Both catchments are situated above 1,000 m a.s.l. within the Sumava National Park and have similar environmental conditions. The isotopic compositions of precipitation, creeks, springs, and lakes were sampled at 3-week intervals over one hydrological year. Water inputs to catchments were derived from isotopically similar local precipitation, whereas run-off was found to have different isotopic signatures. Creeks in the undisturbed catchment had similar to 1 parts per thousand and similar to 7 parts per thousand higher delta O-18 and delta H-2 with similar to 2 parts per thousand lower d-excess than in the disturbed catchment. The d-excess in creeks of the undisturbed catchment was more pronounced, particularly during snowmelt, and highly heterogeneous as compared with the disturbed catchment. Creeks in the undisturbed catchment were mainly fed by precipitation during the warm period (May-October), whereas creeks in the disturbed catchment were mostly fed by precipitation during the cold period (November-April). Estimated mean transit times of creeks and springs were similar to 6 months, except for two creeks in the undisturbed catchment, which had residence times of similar to 1 year. Although evaporation and transpiration fluxes were apparently reduced in the disturbed catchment, transpiration ratios were similar for both catchments. The difference in isotope signatures between catchments was attributed to the altered role of the forest canopy in temporal water distribution, which produced changes in the water cycle, potentially influencing important biogeochemical processes.

Palaeoclimatic changes in northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau revealed by magnetostratigraphy and magnetic susceptibility analysis of thick loess deposits	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES-GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW												Reconstruction of a complete Quaternary record of climatic changes in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is not well obtained, because of high relief and extensive surface erosion. In this study, two long cores obtained from thick loess deposits in the region, both contain clear alternations of loess and paleosols, indicating distinct climate changes during the Quaternary. The palaeomagnetic stratigraphy and optically stimulated luminescence dating indicate that the loess deposition began approximately 2.0 Ma ago, with continuous accumulation until the Holocene. Dust accumulation rates in this region are much higher than those in the central Chinese Loess Plateau, suggesting an extended dust source and/or robust transport agent. Variations of magnetic susceptibility of the loess are a good proxy index of warm/wet and cold/dry alternations and are correlated with the intensity of pedogensis. The magnetic susceptibility record reveals that a relatively cold/dry climate dominated the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the Quaternary, punctuated by warm/wet phases. A stepwise strengthening of the plateau summer monsoon, with a significant strengthening at around 1200-1000 ka and at least 7 phases of strengthening of the plateau summer monsoon in the past 800 ka are interpreted from the core data. The cores provide evidence that strengthened warm/wet climates occurred at around 80-130, 190-250, 290-340, 385-420, 500-625, 690-720 and 755-780 ka, which may correlate to warm/wet phases in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The palaeoclimate changes probably were regulated by the glacial-interglacial alternations.					; wang, xianyan/ABO-8369-2022; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019	wang, xianyan/0000-0002-8281-5734; Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319; Xuefeng, Sun/0000-0002-2688-4663													0016-7746					SEP	2012	91	1-2					189	198																WOS:000310714400013

At nine offshore stations, no lake herring were captured during the day but density averaged 39.6 adultfish/ha at night. At a lakewide scale (n = 18 stations), precision (relative standard error) was much better using night midwater trawls and acoustic gear (37%) compared to day bottom trawls (100%). Moderate sample Size increases using the former methodology would likely bring precision within recommended levels (<= 30%) for stock-recruit data sets. Our results suggest that 1) population abundances of adult lake herring in Lake Superior are much higher than previously considered, 2) the annualspring fish community survey may not provide a relative index of abundance of adult lake herring, 3) night midwater trawls and acoustic gear are necessary for assessing adult lake herring abundance, and 4) previous studies using lake herring data from the annual spring fish community survey need to be re-evaluated in light of these results. Lake herring appear to become progressively more pelagic and less susceptible to bottom trawling as they mature. Day bottom trawls appear to be an adequate tool for estimating relative density of age-1 recruits, although this method still suffers from relatively poor precision.					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023	Moore, Seth/0000-0002-5875-9306; 													0380-1330						2006	32	2					280	292		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[280:EOBTAC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[280:EOBTAC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000239185200007

Intra- and Intersystem Variation in Largemouth Bass Recruitment: Reproduction, Prey Availability, and the Timing of Year-Class Establishment	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Incorporating potentially important events during the first year of life across multiple environmental conditions is needed to generalize models of fish recruitment. Using previous conceptual models as a framework, we quantified sources of intra-and intersystem variation in recruitment of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. We measured age-0 abundances, first-year growth, and potentially important environmental variables across 12 populations and 5-7 year-classes. Interpopulation differences in average recruitment to age 1 were set by variation in number of age-0 fish surviving to the fall. Survival to fall was in turn positively related to density of juvenile bluegills Lepomis macrochirus. First-year growth was positively related to turbidity and adult largemouth bass abundance. For individual lakes, variables explaining a significant amount of intrapopulation variation in recruitment strength were factors associated with either production of age-0 fish from the parental care stage (peak density of age-0 largemouth bass) or prey fish abundance (densities of larval and juvenile bluegills). Abundance of larval bluegills was higher in systems where largemouth bass recruitment to age 1 was not related to bluegill abundance than in lakes where recruitment strength was sensitive to annual fluctuations in prey fish abundance. The relationship between output from the parental care stage and recruitment strength suggests that largemouth bass management should focus on actions designed to influence nest success. Where recruitment is also limited by prey fish availability, management actions can also be directed towards community attributes that influence the growth and production of important prey species.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2010	139	5					1372	1385		10.1577/T09-097.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-097.1													WOS:000282594000010

Site selection was based on high and low anthropogenic influence criteria of paired sites including six spring, six stream, and four lakeshore sites spread over central and eastern parts of Uganda. Unlike the chemophysical water quality, which was water source type dependent (i.e., spring, lake, or stream), fecal indicators were associated with the anthropogenic influence status of the respective sites. A total of 79% of the total variability, including all the determined four bacteriological and five chemophysical parameters, could be assigned to either a pollution, a habitat, or a metabolic activity component by principal-component analysis. Bacteriological indicators revealed significant correlations to the pollution component, reflecting that anthropogenic contamination gradients were followed. Discrimination sensitivity analysis revealed high ability of E. coli to differentiate between high and low levels of anthropogenic influence. CP also showed a reasonable level of discrimination, although FC and TC were found to have worse discrimination efficacy. Nonpoint influence by soil erosion could not be detected during the study period by correlation analysis, although a theoretical contamination potential existed, as investigated soils in the immediate surroundings often contained relevant concentrations of fecal indicators. The outcome of this study indicates that rapid techniques for presumptive E. coli and CP determination may be reliable for fecal pollution monitoring in high-altitude tropical developing countries such as those of Eastern Africa.

AD 1315 syn-eruption and AD 1904 post-eruption breakout floods from Lake Tarawera, Haroharo caldera, North Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Breakout floods have resulted from temporary blockage of the Lake Tarawera outlet during and after late Holocene eruptions. The largest flood occurred near the end of the c. AD 1315 Kaharoa rhyolite eruption episode of Tarawera volcano after a fan of reworked volcaniclastic material had blocked the existing outlet channel. The 41 km(2) lake rose to >30 m above its present elevation (298 m) before overtopping and releasing c. 1.7 km(3) of lake water as the outlet was scoured down by >40 m. The resulting flood excavated a 300 m wide, 3 km long spillway between the lake and the c. 70 m high Tarawera Falls, and eroded a 1 km wide valley below the falls. Flood deposits, including sand and gravel bars with clast diameters locally exceeding 10 m, are traceable to 40 km downstream of the breach area. Peak discharge at the breach area was c. 10(5) m(3)/s, judging from breach geometry and lake hypsometry. Maximum clast sizes at 5-10 km downstream from the breach indicate a peak discharge of at least 10(4)m(3)/s in the main river channel. Floodwater also traversed a 3 km wide interfluve to cause massive erosion in an adjacent valley. A similar but smaller fan dam that formed after the AD 1886 Tarawera eruption failed in AD 1904, generating a much smaller flood of c. 700 m(3)/s.																			0028-8306					SEP	2005	48	3					491	506		10.1080/00288306.2005.9515128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2005.9515128													WOS:000232753500007

Maluendez; Rodriguez, Patricia			Interannual variability in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and quality in shallow water bodies of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina)	LIMNOLOGICA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial component of the global carbon cycle, significantly influencing aquatic ecosystems through its quantity and quality, which are shaped by abiotic factors such as precipitation, runoff, and solar radiation. Recently, the role of winter conditions, particularly ice cover, has gained attention due to the ongoing biogeochemical processes that occur during this period. This study explores the effect of winter precipitations on DOM dynamics in humic shallow lakes and beaver ponds in Tierra del Fuego over two consecutive years. Higher accumulated precipitation in 2021 compared to 2022 led to differences in DOM properties. While dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels were higher in 2022, likely due to concentration effects from reduced precipitation, shallow lakes and beaver ponds exhibited distinct responses. Absorbance-based (water color, SUVA and spectral slope) assessments revealed a slight increase in DOM molecular size in shallow lakes during 2022, whereas fluorescence-based indices (HIX and BIX) indicated greater humification in 2021 but fewer humic components, suggesting complex patterns of allochthonous DOM mobilization. These findings highlight the importance of precipitation regimes and runoff in shaping DOM dynamics in subantarctic aquatic systems, with significant contribution from the surrounding soils and vegetation.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				NOV	2025	115								126282	10.1016/j.limno.2025.126282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2025.126282													WOS:001582182200001
J	Looman, SJ; Shirley, DL; White, CM				Looman, SJ; Shirley, DL; White, CM			Productivity, food habits, and associated variables of Barn Owls utilizing nest boxes in north central Utah	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Productivity and food habits of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) utilizing nest boxes in Juab, Utah, and Salt Lake counties, Utah, during 1979-1981 were examined. Average clutch size was 5.8 eggs for the 6-yr period; mean number fledged. was 3.9 young per successful nest. While severe weather during the 1981-82 winter did not result in a significant decrease in productivity during the 1982 breeding season, it may have resulted in a significant overproduction of female young. Barn Owls in north central Utah fed almost exclusively on mammalian species, particularly Microtus spp. Differences in clutch size between areas and years may be a response to availability as well as abundance of prey.																			0017-3614					JAN	1996	56	1					73	84																WOS:A1996TW16300009

The extent to which future global warming may intensify droughts in this populous region is a matter of utmost concern. Palaeoclimatic data can help inform scientists learn more about the temporal patterns and drivers of monsoon change over geological timescales. In this paper, we present a new 8,200 year biomarker record preserved in the annually laminated sediments of Maar Lake Twintaung, Myanmar. The delta C-13(27-35) sedimentary record is mainly derived from leaf wax lipids in the lake catchment, which is presently dominated by C-3 vegetation in the modern lake catchment. The delta C-13(27-35) is mainly regulated by plant physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress and, as such, can be used as a proxy of past changes in moisture. The delta C-13(27-35) record reveals distinct decadal-to-centennial-scale droughts superimposed on a trend of gradually decreasing summer monsoon intensity from the mid-Holocene to late Holocene. Within the limits of the dating uncertainties, these decadal-to-centennial-scale droughts are found to be well correlated with the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It highlights thepimportance of the Intertropical Convergence Zone shift (tropical monsoon trough) in regulating monsoon rainfall in the region. In addition, most of the droughts are likely to be linked with active volcanism and solar minima and suggest a coupled process between external drivers and internal climate dynamics.

Neoglacial trends in diatom dynamics from a small alpine lake in the Qinling mountains of central China	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												During the latter stages of the Holocene, and prior to anthropogenic global warming, the Earth underwent a period of cooling called the neoglacial. The neoglacial is associated with declining summer insolation and changes to Earth's surface albedo. Although impacts varied globally, in China the neoglacial was generally associated with a cooler climate and an attenuated Asian summer monsoon. Few studies in central China, however, have explored the impact of neoglacial cooling on freshwater diversity, especially in alpine regions. Here we take a palaeolimnological approach to characterise multi-decadal variability in diatom community composition, ecological guilds, and compositional turnover over the past 3500 years from the alpine Yuhuang Chi lake on Mount Taibai in the Qinling mountains. Diatoms in the high-profile guild dominate much of the record from 3500 to 615 cal BP, which suggests that few nutrients in the lake were limiting overall, and disturbance and herbivory were likely low. After 615 cal BP, low-profile and planktic guild diatoms increase, suggesting greater turbulence in the lake, alongside a decline in available nutrients. Diatom turnover highlights periods in the lake history when deterministic processes structured diatom communities. For example, an abrupt decline in turnover is coincident with the shift from high- to low-profile diatoms at 615 cal BP, and this is likely due to the onset of the Little Ice Age in the region. We suggest that Yuhuang Chi lake became more shallow during peak regional aridity, which led to the short-lived community restructuring observed in the record.

Heat-wave effects on greenhouse gas emissions from shallow lake mesocosms	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Shallow lakes are a key component of the global carbon cycle. It is, therefore, important to know how shallow lake ecosystems will respond to the current climate change. Global warming affects not only average temperatures, but also the frequency of heat waves (HW). The impact of extreme events on ecosystems processes, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is uncertain. Using the world's longest-running shallow lake experiment, we studied the effects of a simulated summer HW on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The experimental mesocosms had been exposed to different temperature treatments and nutrient loading for 11years prior to the artificial HW. In general, there was an increase in total GHG emissions during the 1-month artificial HW, with a significant increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O being observed in the shallow lake mesocosms. No significant effect of the HW on CO2 emissions could be traced, though, in the mesocosms with high nutrient levels. Furthermore, the data suggested that in addition to the direct effect of increased temperature on metabolic processes during the HW, biotic interactions exerted a significant control of GHG emissions. For example, at low nutrient levels, increased CO2 emissions were associated with low macrophyte abundance, whereas at high nutrient levels, decreased phytoplankton abundance was linked to increased emissions of CO2 and CH4. In contrast to the observable heat-wave effect, no clear general effect of the long-term temperature treatments could be discerned over the summer, likely because the potential effects of the moderate temperature increase, applied as a press disturbance, were overridden by biotic interactions. This study demonstrates that the role of biotic interactions needs to be considered within the context of global warming on ecosystem processes.

A GCM comparison of Pleistocene super-interglacial periods in relation to Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Arctic Russia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Until now, the lack of time-continuous, terrestrial paleoenvironmental data from the Pleistocene Arctic has made model simulations of past interglacials difficult to assess. Here, we compare climate simulations of four warm interglacials at Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 1 (9 ka), 5e (127 ka), 11c (409 ka) and 31 (1072 ka) with new proxy climate data recovered from Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia. Climate reconstructions of the mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM) indicate conditions up to 0.4, 2.1, 0.5 and 3.1 degrees C warmer than today during MIS 1, 5e, 11c and 31, respectively. While the climate model captures much of the observed warming during each interglacial, largely in response to boreal summer (JJA) orbital forcing, the extraordinary warmth of MIS 11c compared to the other interglacials in the Lake El'gygytgyn temperature proxy reconstructions remains difficult to explain. To deconvolve the contribution of multiple influences on interglacial warming at Lake El'gygytgyn, we isolated the influence of vegetation, sea ice and circum-Arctic land ice feedbacks on the modeled climate of the Beringian interior. Simulations accounting for climate-vegetation-land-surface feedbacks during all four interglacials show expanding boreal forest cover with increasing summer insolation intensity. A deglaciated Greenland is shown to have a minimal effect on northeast Asian temperature during the warmth of stages 11c and 31 (Melles et al., 2012). A prescribed enhancement of oceanic heat transport into the Arctic Ocean does have some effect on Lake El'gygytgyn's regional climate, but the exceptional warmth of MIS 11c remains enigmatic compared to the modest orbital and greenhouse gas forcing during that interglacial.

However, the mechanisms underlying the water use patterns of plants in the alpine desert of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau remain poorly understood. This study investigated seasonal variations in the water sources of herbs (Carex moorcroftii, Astragalus adsurgens) and shrubs (Artemisia oxycephala, Hippophae rhamnoides) using stable oxygen-18 isotope methods. The results indicated that the native herbs (C. moorcroftii, A. adsurgens) and one of the shrubs (A. oxycephala) mainly relied on water from the shallow layer (0-30 cm) throughout the growing season, while the introduced shrub (H. rhamnoides) showed plasticity in switching between water from shallow and deep soil layers depending on soil water availability. All studied plants primarily depended on water from shallow soil layers early in the season. The differences of water use patterns between the introduced and native plants are closely linked with the range of active root zones when competing for water. Our findings will facilitate the mechanistic understanding of plant-soil-water relations in alpine desert ecosystems and provide information for screening introduced species for sand fixation.

J	FROST, WE; KIPLING, C				FROST, WE; KIPLING, C			A STUDY OF REPRODUCTION EARLY LIFE WEIGHT-LENGTH RELATIONSHIP AND GROWTH OF PIKE ESOX LUCIUS L IN WINDERMERE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Pike were sampled by means of gill nets in winter from 1944 to 1965. The majority of both male and female pike breed for the first time at age 2 years; the mean length of the males is then 38 cm and of the females 42 cm. The ovaries build up from Oct. to March and when ripe form 18-20% of the body weight. The building up of the testis is completed by Oct. and when ripe it forms only 2-4% of the body weight. As the fish increases in weight the number of eggs increases in proportion. In Windermere the breeding season lasts from mid-March to the beginning of May with mid-April as the height of the spawning time. There is evidence of "homing" in the sense of the fish repeatedly returning to spawn in a particular place. Eggs incubated in the laboratory took a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 21 days to hatch at water temperatures ranging from 6.6[degree] to 12.5[degree]C; eggs reared at 10[degree] C hatched in 12 days. For the first few days of life the alevins were attached to vegetation. This has the advantage of keeping them clear of silt, hiding them from predators and providing access to the Entomostraca on which they feed. Observations of pike fry in aquaria during their first four months of life showed that they had a home range (not a territory), were aggressive only if crowded, had the same technique of feeding as adults, and moved little. The selective action of 2 1/2 in. (6.4 cm) bar gill net did not invalidate the use of data from gill netted pike for the calculation of age, growth and weight-length equations. The parameters of the weight-length equation W = ALb for pike caught in the summer were as follows: immature A =[long dash]2.28, b = 3.09; mature males A = 2.44, b = 3.18; mature females A =[long dash]2.59, b = 3.27. All bs differed significantly from 3. Age and growth were calculated from the opercular bones of about 7000 pike and confirmation of the accuracy of the calculations was obtained from recaptured tagged fish. Growth was well described by the von Bertalanffy equation with t0 - W0 = 0. For the year-classes 1951-55 males L = 77 cm, K = 0.36; for females L=o = 99 cm, K = 0.28. Wide variations in growth were apparent between different year-classes, and between individual pike of the same year-class. Growth was better in years when the temperature was high. Pike of the year-classes 1930-38, which lived in the lake before any pike were removed by gill netting, grew more slowly than the year-classes 1951-55.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1967	36	3					651	+		10.2307/2820	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2820													WOS:A1967A283100013

Will the Displacement of Zebra Mussels by Quagga Mussels Increase Water Clarity in Shallow Lakes during Summer? Results from a Mesocosm Experiment	PLoS One												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are known to increase water clarity and affect ecosystem processes in invaded lakes. During the last decade, the conspecific quagga mussels (D. rostriformis bugensis) have displaced zebra mussels in many ecosystems including shallow lakes such as Oneida Lake, New York. In this study, an eight-week mesocosm experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the displacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels leads to further decreases in phytoplankton and increases in water clarity resulting in increases in benthic algae. We found that the presence of zebra mussels alone (ZM), quagga mussels alone (QM), or an equal number of both species (ZQ) reduced total phosphorus (TP) and phytoplankton Chl a. Total suspended solids (TSS) was reduced in ZM and ZQ treatments. Light intensity at the sediment surface was higher in all three mussel treatments than in the no-mussel controls but there was no difference among the mussel treatments. There was no increase in benthic algae biomass in the mussel treatments compared with the no-mussel controls. Importantly, there was no significant difference in nutrient (TP, soluble reactive phosphorus and NO3-) levels, TSS, phytoplankton Chl a, benthic algal Chl a, or light intensity on the sediment surface between ZM, QM and ZQ treatments. These results confirm the strong effect of both mussel species on water clarity and indicate that the displacement of zebra mussel by an equivalent biomass of quagga mussel is not likely to lead to further increases in water clarity, at least for the limnological conditions, including summer temperature, tested in this experiment.																			1932-6203					DEC 22	2016	11	12							e0168494	10.1371/journal.pone.0168494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168494								28005940					WOS:000392843200060

Vertical transmission of honey bee viruses in a Belgian queen breeding program	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH												Background: The Member States of European Union are encouraged to improve the general conditions for the production and marketing of apicultural products. In Belgium, programmes on the restocking of honey bee hives have run for many years. Overall, the success ratio of this queen breeding programme has been only around 50%. To tackle this low efficacy, we organized sanitary controls of the breeding queens in 2012 and 2014. Results: We found a high quantity of viruses, with more than 75% of the egg samples being infected with at least one virus. The most abundant viruses were Deformed Wing Virus and Sacbrood Virus (>= 40%), although Lake Sinai Virus and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus were also occasionally detected ( between 10-30%). In addition, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings, Black Queen Cell Virus, Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus occurred at very low prevalences (<= 5%). Remarkably, we found Apis mellifera carnica bees to be less infected with Deformed Wing Virus than Buckfast bees ( p < 0.01), and also found them to have a lower average total number of infecting viruses ( p < 0.001). This is a significant finding, given that Deformed Wing Virus has earlier been shown to be a contributory factor to winter mortality and Colony Collapse Disorder. Moreover, negative-strand detection of Sacbrood Virus in eggs was demonstrated for the first time. Conclusions: High pathogen loads were observed in this sanitary control program. We documented for the first time vertical transmission of some viruses, as well as significant differences between two honey bee races in being affected by Deformed Wing Virus. Nevertheless, we could not demonstrate a correlation between the presence of viruses and queen breeding efficacies.					; de Graaf, Dirk/HGD-4017-2022; Wenseleers, Tom/J-3960-2013; De Smet, Lina/A-7354-2013	ravoet, Jorgen/0000-0002-2904-7342; de Graaf, Dirk/0000-0001-8817-0781; Wenseleers, Tom/0000-0002-1434-861X; 													1746-6148					MAR 14	2015	11								61	10.1186/s12917-015-0386-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0386-9								25889959					WOS:000351201100002
J	LARSON, DJ				LARSON, DJ			REVISION OF NORTH-AMERICAN AGABUS LEACH (COLEOPTERA, DYTISCIDAE) - ELONGATUS-GROUPS, ZETTERSTEDTI-GROUPS, AND CONFINIS-GROUPS	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												North American species of Agabus Leach of the elongatus-, zetterstedti-, and confinis-groups, as defined by Larson (1989), are revised. Study of character state distribution indicates that the elongatus- and zetterstedti-groups are clades within the confinis-group but the names are retained in this paper to maintain consistency. Twenty species belonging to this complex occur in North America, namely: elongatus-group with A. elongatus Gyllenhal and A. inexspectatus Nilsson; zetterstedti-group with A. zetterstedti Thomson; and the confinis-group with A. thomsoni (J. Sahlberg), A. moestus (Curtis), A. clypealis (Thomson), A. phaeopterus (Kirby), A. immaturus sp. nov. (Great Lakes and Maritime Provinces regions), A. canadensis Fall, A. audeni Wallis, A. mackenziensis sp. nov. (northwestern Canada), A. bicolor (Kirby), A. subfuscatus Sharp. A. discolor (Harris), A. approximatus Fall, A. kootenai sp. nov. (southwestern Canada and northwestern United States), A. inscriptus (Crotch), A. smithi Brown, A. sasquatch sp. nov. (alpine areas of California and Nevada), and A. confinis (Gyllenhal). For each species the following information is provided: synonymy; description and illustration of taxonomically useful characters; notes on relationships, variation, distribution, and ecology; and a map of North American collection localities. A key to the North American species of the confinis-group is presented.

Each species was examined from samples collected at every metre from a time series of depth profiles and analyzed with respect to growth of specialized cells (heterocytes and akinetes), presence of cylindrospermopsins and the accompanying seasonal dynamics of the water body. Growth and dominance of each species was linked to differing seasonal environmental conditions. Both A. ovalisporum and C. raciborskii produced specialized cells during the bloom. As the water chemistry changed, A. ovalisporum produced akinetes before experiencing a rapid decline in cell numbers. In contrast, C raciborskii continued to bloom without producing detectable akinetes. Peak C. raciborskii cell concentrations (83,160 cells mL(-1)) occurred in the late autumn, when surface water temperatures were 19.1 degrees C, and were accompanied by concentrations of total cylindrospermopsins in the hypolimnion exceeding 100 mu g L-1. These toxin concentrations were highly positively correlated with conductivity, soluble iron, bioavailable nutrient species and heterocyte densities. This is the first field study to provide evidence that C. raciborskii, despite being traditionally considered a tropical species, can be highly toxic in cooler waters especially when accompanied by strong stratification involving an anoxic semi-saline hypolimnion. This has serious implications for both water quality management and human health risks in those subtropical climates where C. raciborskii is present. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lange-Bert. was found - a new species for Poland. The highest abundance of G. declivis has been observed on sandy substrate and small stones in the littoral zone of the Upper Lake during the spring season. The species occurred together with Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutz.) Czarn. var. minutissimum, A. catenatum (Bily & Marvan), Fragilaria leptostauron (Ehrenb.) Hust. var. leptostauron and F. pinnata Ehrenb. var. pinnata. Our observations revealed that G. declivis develops in lentic water bodies with medium organic matter content and neutral pH. The species seems to prefer mesotrophic waters with low to medium electrolyte content and oligosaprobous. The species morphology and identity is documented in a series of light microscopic (LM) images and for the first time under a scanning electron microscope (SEM).					; Stanek-Tarkowska, Jadwiga/ABC-6198-2021	Peszek, Lukasz/0000-0002-9132-2210; Stanek-Tarkowska, Jadwiga/0000-0003-1664-2625; Noga, Teresa/0000-0002-4864-5620; Poradowska, Anita/0000-0002-8557-5529													1730-413X	1897-3191				DEC	2013	42	4					480	485		10.2478/s13545-013-0104-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13545-013-0104-9													WOS:000330620900012

We also include similar analyses of the deep chlorophyll maximum during the summer of those years. Ranges based on semivariance analysis and decorrelation distances generally were 5-15 km, with greater differences observed among seasons in the epilimnion and less unresolved error found for the temperature calculations. Our analysis provides information on submesoscale variation in limnological conditions that may be useful for several applications, including planning field sampling, observation networks, and data assimilation.

In this work we present an overview of optical remote sensing techniques applied to lake water monitoring. Then, examples of applications focused on Lake Maggiore, the second largest lake in Italy are discussed by presenting the temporal trend of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), suspended particulate matter (SPM), coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and the z90 signal depth (the latter indicating the water depth from which 90% of the reflected light comes from) as estimated from the images acquired by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) in the pelagic area of the lake from 2003 to 2011. Concerning the chl-a trend, the results are in agreement with the concentration values measured during field surveys, confirming the good status of Lake Maggiore, although occasional events of water deterioration were observed (e. g., an average increase of chl-a concentration, with a decrease of transparency, as a consequence of an anomalous phytoplankton occurred in summer 2011). A series of MERIS-derived maps (summer period 2011) of the z90 signal are also analysed in order to show the spatial variability of lake waters, which on average were clearer in the central pelagic zones. We expect that the recently launched (e. g., Landsat-8) and the future satellite missions (e. g., Sentinel-3) carrying sensors with improved spectral and spatial resolution are going to lead to a larger use of remote sensing for the assessment and monitoring of water quality parameters, by also allowing further applications (e. g., classification of phytoplankton functional types) to be developed.

Features of the Intrinsic L-Band Radiation of the Gulf of Ob during the Freeze-Up Period	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												This article analyzes seasonal and interannual dependences of brightness temperature in different zones of the Gulf of Ob according to data from the MIRAS radiometer (SMOS satellite). It is shown that, while the brightness temperature dynamics of the freshwater zone of the Gulf of Ob (the estuary and the central zone) is similar to that of freshwater lakes, this dynamics in the seawater zone is different. The authors explain this difference by an increase in water salinity and, consequently, an increase in radiation absorption in the lower ice layer, which is in contact with the water surface. The regularities of seasonal variations of brightness temperature in different zones of the Gulf of Ob and related ice-cover phases can be used to assess salinity and water mixing in large estuaries of the Arctic in winter based on satellite microwave radiometry.

J	Morling, K; Herzsprung, P; Kamjunke, N				Morling, Karoline; Herzsprung, Peter; Kamjunke, Norbert			Discharge determines production of, decomposition of and quality changes in dissolved organic carbon in pre-dams of drinking water reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pre-dams are small reservoirs constructed upstream of the main drinking water reservoirs and are used for nutrient removal and sediment trapping. Little is known about the role of pre-dams regarding the production and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to discharge and how this affects the quality of DOC in the water. We combined quantitative and qualitative investigations under different hydrological conditions at three pre-dams exhibiting a gradient from oligotrophic/high-DOC to eutrophic/low-DOC. All pre-dams were mainly autotrophic in their upper water layers. The ratio of OC production to total gained OC (i.e. OC import + OC production) decreased with increasing discharge. On average, 0-30% of the total gained OC was produced within the pre-dams. The amount of microbially decomposed DOC increased with the average water residence time (WRT) and with the trophic status of the pre-dams. Radiocarbon analyses of respired CO2 revealed that heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilized old DOC components (195-395 years before present) under base flow conditions, whereas younger components (modern, i.e. OC produced after 1950) were utilized at high discharge. DOC quality changed significantly over the year within the pre-dams: High proportions of algae-derived DOC were observed during base flow in summer, and the freshness index (beta/alpha ratio) decreased significantly with higher discharges. DOC production and quality changes in response to hydrological conditions should be considered for future water quality management in reservoirs, as climate scenarios for temperate regions predict decreased runoffs leading to longer WRT and increased eutrophication and production of algae derived OC.

Lake Ontario supported 24% of the breeding population in 1991, and the largest colony-5,428 nests on Little Galloo Island (LGI). Increases at LGI averaged 36% per annum since colonization in 1974. This dramatic increase is attributed to three main factors: 1) reduced levels of organochlorine contaminants in the diet, particularly DDE which caused eggshell thinning, leading to egg breakage and total reproductive failure; 2) relaxation of human persecution, which kept overall Great Lakes cormorant numbers low earlier this century; and 3) increased availability of forage-base fish, particularly alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Cormorant increases at LGI since 1983 were correlated significantly with abundance indices of sexually mature alewife three years previously. Most cormorants first breed when 3 years old, and alewife are important in the diet in Lake Ontario. Since the DDT-era, alewife availability has probably been the key factor affecting cormorant reproductive output, fledging condition, and post-fledging survival on Lake Ontario, and hence subsequent recruitment rates. LGI cormorants winter along Atlantic coasts of the southeastern U.S. and in the lower Mississippi Valley. Improved over-winter survival due to exploitation of farmed channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), may also have increased recruitment rates of cormorants.																			0380-1330						1994	20	2					443	456																WOS:A1994NZ71300011

ZOOBENTHOS IN WATERCOURSES AND WATER BODIES IN THE BOLONSKY STATE NATURE RESERVE (RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Invertebrates play a major role in food chains, being the main feed stock for many vertebrates. So far, the benthic fauna communities are still poorly studied in many water body types, including wetlands in the River Amur basin. In 2015-2018, we conducted for the first time the study of zoobenthos in water bodies located in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve (Khabarovsky Krai, Russia). We present data on the general taxonomic composition and occurrence of benthic invertebrates in rivers and lakes. In addition, information on the structure, density and biomass of their populations is provided. The environmental assessment of the water bodies of the Protected Area has been performed on the basis of zoobenthos composition. Quantitative samples of benthos were collected using the GR-91 rod bottom scoop from a depth from 50 cm to 400 cm and using the folding benthometer until a 25-cm depth. All sampled were fixed in a 4% formalin solution. Amphibiotic insect adults were collected using an entomological net and light traps. These samples were fixed in a 75-96% ethanol solution and processed according to the generally accepted methods. A total of 168 taxa from 15 systematic hydrobiont groups were recorded. The majority of them were Chironomidae (87 species), Trichoptera (18 species) and Ephemeroptera (16 species). Quantitative indicators of organisms were correlated with the seasonal fluctuations in the hydrological regime and the soil type. During floods, the quantitative sampling of zoobenthos was impossible. During a low-water period, studies were available predominantly in small and medium rivers and channels in which entry by boat is possible. In lakes, we found low quantitative values of density and biomass of benthos (297 +/- 91 individuals/m(2) and 0.1 +/- 0.1 g/m(2)). The average values of density and biomass were respectively 824 +/- 267 individuals/m(2) and 8.6 +/- 8.1 g/m(2) in streams, 1298 +/- 538 individuals/m(2) and 11.2 +/- 5.8 g/m(2) in small rivers, and 473 +/- 76 individuals/m(2), and 23.3 +/- 9.7 g/m(2) in medium rivers. Clean sand was the poorest soil in lakes and rivers. In areas with a slowed flow in springs and channels, the presence of silty-sandy soils with an admixture of detritus provides a higher number of habitats suitable for the aquatic organisms in contrast to the main riverbeds of lowlands. We demonstrated that in water bodies, the conditions favourable for the benthic communities are observed on plant root systems immersed in water along riverbeds, in channels and bays, and on silty sands with a rich admixture of detritus at an average depth of 1.7 m. The density and biomass of zoobenthos varied from 6 individuals/m(2) to 25 110 individuals/m(2) and from < 0.1 g/m(2) to 11 81.9 g/m(2). The average density of benthic populations was 692 +/- 119 individuals/m(2) and the average biomass - 16.9 +/- 5.8 g/m(2). High values of benthos density were recorded in the summer period, while high values of the benthos biomass was observed in the spring period. During the vegetative seasons, Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Mollusca, and Trichoptera dominated in the zoobenthos composition. This is related with their life cycles and the influence of various abiotic factors (floods, current velocity, water temperature, oxygen regime, soil nature). We found that the proportion of Mollusca was 89% of the total zoobenthos biomass, while proportions of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae were respectively 60% and 26% of the total density. Higher values of the occurrence frequency were demonstrated for Chironomidae (100%) and Oligochaeta (95%). Hydra, Planaria, aquatic mites, Asellidae, Odonata, black flies, Ephydridae, and Coleoptera were rarely recorded (< 10%). Permanent components of the benthic communities were eurybionts and limnobionts belonging to Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Nematoda, which inhabit preferably channels and sites with a slowed current velocity, namely lakes and mires. The absence of oxyphilic species of Plecoptera, Deuterophlebiidae, and Blephariceridae was characteristic. This is comparable with wetlands around the world. The most interesting records were Amuranodonta boloniensis and Cristaria herculea included in the various-rank Red Data Books, as well as Monodiamesa kamora known only in the Lower Amur River basin. Two Chironomidae species, Heterotrissocladius simmiensis, Propsilocerus amurensis, have been described for science for the first time on the basis of samples collected in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve. Finally, Axarus fundorum is a new species in the Russian fauna. According to biological indication data, the water bodies of the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve belong to a clean type. They are characterised by high environmental status and meet the requirements of the European Framework Water Directive (WFD), which is required to create a network of reference targets. The presence of new and threatened species indicates the uniqueness of the wetlands in the Lake Bolon neighbourhood and the need for their conservation and further investigations.

The exchange of wet and dry periods influences the through-flow of energy and the turnover of matter in the lake. In the last five decades, the water level fluctuations were highly variable. Since 1961 the May and June water levels have shown a decreasing trend line, in October the trend line revealed an increase, while from November to February no changes of trend could be observed. High water levels in winter and during the peak vegetation season negatively affected reed productivity. The decomposition of reed leaves increased with the wetness of the survey location, while the soil mineralisation rate was only slightly related to soil wetness. In comparison to the tributaries, the lake water contained relatively low amount of nutrients, which was a consequence of a densely vegetated area.																					978-90-481-9585-5; 978-90-481-9584-8				2010							251	262		10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5_18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5_18	10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5												WOS:000321676000018

The main objective of this investigation is to identify and explain the possible origin of the prominent periodicities present in the magnetic susceptibility data. Significant periodicities in the TK chi(lf) data are centered at 906, 232, 147, 128, 96, 61, 54 and 44 years, which might have a solar origin. The wavelet power spectrum of the raw and detrended chi(lf) data confirms the findings of spectral analysis and also provides temporal variations of the significant cyclicities during the past 3700 cal. years B.P. Positive correlation is documented between sunspot activity and TK chi(lf) data; cross-spectral analysis of the reconstructed sunspot data and TK chi(lf) data suggest that there is a strong coherence between the two datasets as significant periodicities are documented in both. There is a good match between the TK chi(lf) and the reconstructed total solar irradiance data for the past 1200 years. However, an out-of-phase relationship is documented at certain time-intervals, which may be attributed to uncertainties in the age-depth model. The results obtained from this study show that solar variations are the main controlling factor of the southwest monsoon and, like other archives from different regions in India, the TK lake sediments have also recorded these solar signatures.

We investigated the gut fungal communities of Anser erythropus wintering at either Shengjin Lake or Caizi Lake, China, using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer gene region. We retained 1,302,562 valid tags corresponding to 2,102 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 20 fecal samples (ten per lake). The OTUs from the Shengjin Lake geese represented 7 phyla, 27 classes, 81 orders, 151 families, and 395 genera; those from the Caizi Lake geese comprised 7 phyla, 28 classes, 73 orders, 133 families, and 232 genera. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Rozellomycota were the dominant gut fungal phyla in the geese. The alpha-diversity indices differed significantly between the Shengjin Lake and Caizi Lake geese. The Shengjin Lake geese ate mainly Poaceae species, whereas the Caizi Lake geese ate mainly Carex spp., suggesting that different diets might induce varied gut fungal communities between the geese. More fungal genera were significantly correlated with bacterial genera (Sphingobacterium, Brevundimonas, Stenotrophomonas, Chryseobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas) in pairwise populations, and Ceratobasidium, Tomentella, Paurocotylis, Tuber, Podospora and Mortierella were the core fungal genera among the geese from both lakes. Nine potentially pathogenic species were identified across all samples, and the relative abundances of potential pathogens were significantly higher in the Shengjin Lake samples than in the Caizi Lake samples. These findings suggest that the gut fungi were highly sensitive to the diets of the geese at both lakes. Potential pathogenic species of A. erythropus should be further studied.

R.; Nautiyal, Chandra Mohan; Shah, Rayees Ahmad			Late Holocene paleoenvironmental changes inferred from Manasbal Lake sediments, Kashmir Valley, India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Paleoclimate investigations and reconstruction using the lake sediment cores of Kashmir Valley have been rarely attempted. The basin is influenced by Indian Summer Monsoon, Westerlies and the local katabatic winds. In the present study, an 80 cm undisturbed sediment core was retrieved from the Manasbal Lake situated in North western Himalaya. Sediments were dated using C-14 method, and the age-depth model indicated a depositional history extending from similar to 3345 yrs BP to the present. Grain size, major and trace elements, TOC, OM contents C/N ratio and diatom assemblages were applied to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental changes around the area. The A-CN-K diagram displays that the weathering intensity of the Manasbal lake sediments are moderate to highly weathered and the sediments have been derived from nearby and mixed source origin. Several wet and cold phases were identified during similar to 3300 yrs BP to similar to 2500 yrs BP and -1800 yrs BP to -1300 yrs BP due to intense precipitation reflect high lake level. These wet phases are marked by higher sand and silt content, C/N ratio and high allochthonous input with less abundance of diatom species, clay, OM, TOC contents and high CIA values. Consequently, low lake level and dry and cold period from similar to 3345 yrs BP to similar to 3300 yrs BP and similar to 2500 yrs BP to similar to 1800 yrs BP is observed. These inferences are corroborated with the trace elemental ratios CIA and CWI data. Our data indicate that the Westerlies and localised katabtic winds rather than the Indian summer monsoons played a major role in controlling the past climate around the Manasbal lake, Kashmir Valley.					; Nautiyal, Chandra/F-7892-2012; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022	Shah, Rayees Ahmad/0000-0002-3052-6391; Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 25	2019	507				SI		156	171		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.02.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.02.017													WOS:000464516500016

Morphology and Specific Features of Formation of Thermal Lake Utinaya Banya	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												This paper describes a set of studies performed at a thermal manifestation (Lake Utinaya Banya) on the Iturup Island (Kuril Islands). These studies include bathymetric survey of the lake basin, geometric leveling across the lake, pitting, sampling of thermal waters from the lake and springs, hydrochemical research, and isotopic analysis of oxygen and hydrogen in the lake water. It is suggested by the shape of the lake basin (close to lenticular with a significant concentric depression), the underwater gas-hydrothermal vents, the bank along the perimeter of the lake basin, and the presence of several layers of clastic deposits at the top of the rampart that the lake was formed by a hydrothermal eruption. The lake temperature has remained constant over the years and ranges on average from 25 to 15 degrees C, depending on the season. The water of Lake Utinaya Banya is represented by acidic, sulfate calcium, and low-mineralized waters.

The impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure and function	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Recent climate-change research largely confirms the impacts on US ecosystems identified in the 2009 National Climate Assessment and provides greater mechanistic understanding and geographic specificity for those impacts. Pervasive climate-change impacts on ecosystems are those that affect productivity of ecosystems or their ability to process chemical elements. Loss of sea ice, rapid warming, and higher organic inputs affect marine and lake productivity, while combined impacts of wildfire and insect outbreaks decrease forest productivity, mostly in the arid and semi-arid West. Forests in wetter regions are more productive owing to warming. Shifts in species ranges are so extensive that by 2100 they may alter biome composition across 5-20% of US land area. Accelerated losses of nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems to receiving waters are caused by both winter warming and intensification of the hydrologic cycle. Ecosystem feedbacks, especially those associated with release of carbon dioxide and methane release from wetlands and thawing permafrost soils, magnify the rate of climate change.					; Schimel, Joshua/AAE-7380-2019; Luo, Yiqi/C-3991-2008; Nadelhoffer, Knute/AAE-7744-2020; Gonzalez, Patrick/B-9479-2013; Raymond, Peter/C-4087-2009; Bierwagen, Britta/G-5943-2010; Grimm, Nancy/D-2840-2009; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Bierwagen, Britta/0000-0003-3212-0341; Raymond, Peter/0000-0002-8564-7860; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Pairis, Amber/0000-0002-1268-8717; Nadelhoffer, Knute/0000-0001-9775-894X; Gonzalez, Patrick/0000-0002-7105-0561; Grimm, Nancy/0000-0001-9374-660X; Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255													1540-9295	1540-9309				NOV	2013	11	9					474	482		10.1890/120282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/120282													WOS:000326363900004

Water age calculated from tritium and helium as well as from chlorofluorocarbons does not exceed 19 yr. Relative saturation of dissolved oxygen typically exceeds 80%. The equation of state of Baikal water was determined including the effect of dissolved ions and silicic acid. Based on nearly 600 CTD profiles taken between 1993 and 1995, two mechanisms of deep-water mixing were identified. (1) In spring, cold and relatively saline water from the Selenga, the major inflow to the lake, forms a density plume that reaches the bottom of the central basin during April and early May. Due to entrainment of lake water the plume transports about 125 km(3) of water per year to the deepest part of the basin. Later in spring, the river water forms the thermal bar observed along the eastern shore. There are indications that parts of the Selenga are also plunging to the deep part of the southern basin. (2) At Academician Ridge, separating the cold and ''saline'' water of the central basin from the warmer and slightly less saline water of the northern basin, horizontal mixing results in a water mass that can sink on either side of the sill. Whereas in the central basin the water mass stays at intermediate depth, in the northern basin it sinks to the deepest part. More detailed data are needed to quantify this density flux. No indication of a wind-induced thermobaric instability was found.																			0024-3590					JUL	1997	42	5					841	855		10.4319/lo.1997.42.5.0841	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.5.0841													WOS:A1997YK66100005

The 91 sites were divided into 3 groups based on surface salinity: the Inner area had salinity level below 10 parts per thousand and was mostly located in the Pearl River Estuary, the Coastal area had salinity between 10 parts per thousand and 32 parts per thousand and was almost located along the coastline, while the Offshore area had salinity level higher than 32 parts per thousand and was mainly located in the open area. Indicator Species Analysis was conducted to identify the indicator species within each group from among all calanoid copepods taxa. We found that the Inner area was characterized by Acartiella sinensis, Pseudodiaptomus poplesia and Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, the coastal area was characterized by Temora turbinata and Subeucalanus subcrassus, and the Offshore area was characterized by Paracandacia truncata, Subeucalanus subtenuis, Euchaeta rimana, Pareucalanus attenuatus, Rhincalanus cornutus, Cosmocalanus darwini, Centropages gracilis, Undinula vulgaris, Nannocalanus minor and Paraeuchaeta russelli. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to identify relevant biotic and abiotic parameters that can best explain the distribution of calanoid copepods. CCA showed that during the summer of 2006, salinity, nutrient variables, especially SiO3-Si, NO3-N and DTN, Depth and Chl a were the environmental variables that strongly impacted the distribution and community structure of calanoid copepods.

J	CLARKSON, ENK; MILNER, AR; COATES, MI				CLARKSON, ENK; MILNER, AR; COATES, MI			PALEOECOLOGY OF THE VISEAN OF EAST KIRKTON, WEST-LOTHIAN, SCOTLAND	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES												The Visean sequence at East Kirkton was deposited in a shallow lake, set within a richly vegetated landscape formed of volcanic cones a few hundred metres high. There was little volcanic activity, however, while the lake existed, and the many tuff horizons within the sequence were washed in during weathering. The lake may have been generally cool, though of unusual water chemistry, as a result of which the spherulitic East Kirkton Limestone precipitated. At times, however, water temperatures may have risen sharply through localised hot-spring activity; both factors deterred 'normal' aquatic life. The bulk of the preserved biota consists of plants (permineralisations and compressions) and dominantly land-living animals, including the oldest terrestrial tetrapods (amphibians and reptiliomorphs), large terrestrial-aquatic eurypterids, the first harvestman and rare millipedes. All these animals lived close to the lake, in a fire-prone forest dominated by gymnosperms and pteridosperms. At a late stage in the history of the lake, deposition of spherulitic limestones was replaced by black shales, bearing a 'standard' Oil-Shale fish fauna, suggesting that the isolated lake had linked with a larger fish-bearing water body. This is coupled with a shift to a lycopod-dominated flora and may indicate a climatic change to wetter conditions. Finally the lake silted up with tuff, ending an existence of only a few tens of thousands of years.

Reliance of brown trout on terrestrial prey varies with season but not fish density	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The importance of terrestrial carbon in aquatic ecosystems is widely recognised, but patterns of terrestrial reliance can be variable. Fish often act as important links between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but little is known about how resource seasonality and fish density influence fish reliance on terrestrial energy in lakes. We sampled a high-latitude subarctic lake in Finnish Lapland during the open-water season over three consecutive years to assess both patterns of terrestrial reliance and trophic niche structure of introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta), the only resident fish species. The small size of the study lake made it possible to sample the whole population by conducting a complete fish removal, allowing for a direct assessment of size structure and changes in brown trout density over time. We hypothesised that annual and seasonal shifts in the dietary niches of brown trout would directly track the availability of pulsed resources such as aquatic and terrestrial insects as well as rodents. We further expected that dietary niche shifts would be correlated with population density, leading to a smaller trophic niche size at lower densities. We therefore investigated the annual and seasonal patterns of resource use using measures of dietary niche and in particular of terrestrial reliance, derived from stomach content analysis and stable-isotope analyses (SIA) of liver and muscle, along a temporal gradient of declining fish density. According to stomach content, terrestrial reliance in brown trout was the highest in each year at mid-to-late summer, evidently following the peak abundance of terrestrial invertebrates and rodents. Surprisingly, we could not detect annual or seasonal shifts in terrestrial reliance from estimates provided by isotope ratios in muscle or liver. Furthermore, fish density did not appear to influence either terrestrial reliance or trophic niche size. However, trophic position derived from SIA of liver tissue decreased with decreasing densities, while fish condition increased. Large, consistent pulses of terrestrial invertebrates in mid-summer (or rodents during their peak years) are likely important for brown trout in the long term and could explain the lack of density-dependent correlation in terrestrial reliance. However, further studies are needed to link the abundance of pulsed resources to resource use by fish across wider gradients of lake size, productivity and fish density.					; Milardi, Marco/ACZ-4214-2022	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Milardi, Marco/0000-0001-6104-294X													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2016	61	7					1143	1156		10.1111/fwb.12775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12775													WOS:000377223300009

Late Holocene water level fluctuations of Lake Afourgagh (Middle-Atlas Mountains, Morocco) inferred from charophyte remains	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Water level fluctuations of Lake Afourgagh (Middle-Atlas Mountains, Morocco) over the last 2500 years (Late Holocene) have been reconstructed using charophyte remains in the lake sediment archives. The study involved 22 pits (1-3 m deep) dug along a transect across the lake shore terrace. Biogenic activity appears to be a dominant contributor to the accumulation of the lake sediments, as the thickest deposits are tufas composed of charophyte-encrusted stems with numerous gyrogonites (termed "charophyte tufas"). The gyrogonites were identified as Chara aspera and Chara hispida remains. The spatial distribution of these two species, measured vertically within a single core and horizontally along the shore terrace, varies according to bathymetry. Shallow proximal environments are characterized by the development of C aspera, whereas C. hispida remains are mostly observed in distal sediments. Moreover, according to their ecological characteristics, the C. hispida belt migrated proximally when the water level rose, whereas the C. aspera belt migrated distally when the water level fell. These trends were observed successively in a single charophyte tufa layer which records the rise, highstand, and fall of lake level in a single depositional sequence. The late Holocene palaeobathymetry of Lake Afourgagh was inferred by comparing data on charophyte remains and deposit geometry. Data provide evidence for four major low lake level phases (estimated in terms of amplitude) which induced the development of palaeosols in proximal settings at 2191 cal. BP, 1769 BR 1515 cal. BP and 1062 cal. BP. These results confirm the accuracy of charophyte-based palaeobathymetry studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sutter's Mill Meteorite Consortium	Radar-Enabled Recovery of the Sutter's Mill Meteorite, a Carbonaceous Chondrite Regolith Breccia	SCIENCE												Doppler weather radar imaging enabled the rapid recovery of the Sutter's Mill meteorite after a rare 4-kiloton of TNT-equivalent asteroid impact over the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in northern California. The recovered meteorites survived a record high-speed entry of 28.6 kilometers per second from an orbit close to that of Jupiter-family comets (Tisserand's parameter = 2.8 +/- 0.3). Sutter's Mill is a regolith breccia composed of CM (Mighei)-type carbonaceous chondrite and highly reduced xenolithic materials. It exhibits considerable diversity of mineralogy, petrography, and isotope and organic chemistry, resulting from a complex formation history of the parent body surface. That diversity is quickly masked by alteration once in the terrestrial environment but will need to be considered when samples returned by missions to C-class asteroids are interpreted.

J	Klausen, C; Nicolaisen, MH; Strobel, BW; Warnecke, F; Nielsen, JL; Jorgensen, NOG				Klausen, C; Nicolaisen, MH; Strobel, BW; Warnecke, F; Nielsen, JL; Jorgensen, NOG			Abundance of actinobacteria and production of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol in Danish streams and fish ponds	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Occurrence of the odours geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) in freshwater environments indicates that odour-producing organisms are commonly occurring. In the present study, we assumed actinomycetes to be a major source of the odours. Seasonal concentrations of odours and abundance of Actinobacteria, which includes actinomycetes and other G(+) and high GC bacteria, were determined in one oligotrophic and two eutrophic freshwater streams, as well as in aquacultures connected to these streams, in Denmark. Concentrations of geosmin and MIB ranged from 2 to 9 ng l(-1) and were lowest in the winter. Passage of stream water in the aquacultures increased the amount of geosmin and MIB by up to 55% and 110%, respectively. Densities of actinobacteria were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization with catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD-FISH) technique and were found to make up from 4 to 38 x 10(7) cells l(-1), corresponding to 3-9% of the total bacterial populations. The lowest densities of actinobacteria occurred in the winter. Filamentous bacteria targeted by the FISH probe made up about 2.7-38% (average was 22%) of the actinobacteria and were expected to be actinomycetes. Combined microautoradiography and CARD-FISH demonstrated that 10-38% (incorporation of H-3-thymidine) and 41-65% (incorporation of H-3-leucine) of the actinobacteria were metabolically active. The proportion of active actinobacteria increased up to 2-fold during passage of stream water in the aquacultures, and up to 98% of the cells became active. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in 8 bacterial isolates with typical actinomycete morphology from the streams and ponds demonstrated that most of them belonged to the genus Streptomyces. The isolated actinomycetes produced geosmin at rates from 0.1 to 35 ag geosmin bacterium(-1) h(-1). MIB was produced at similar rates in 5 isolates, whereas no MIB was produced by three of the isolates. Addition of the odours to stream water demonstrated that indigenous stream bacteria were capable of reducing the odours, and that enrichment with LB medium stimulated the degradation. Our study shows that bacterial communities in freshwater include geosmin- and MIB-producing actinobacteria. However, the mechanisms controlling production as well as degradation of the odours in natural waters appear complex and require further research.

J	MELVILLE, GE				MELVILLE, GE			CHANGES IN THE PELAGIC CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON OF HIGH-BOREAL ISLAND LAKE, SASKATCHEWAN, ASSOCIATED WITH URANIUM MINING	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Island Lake, Saskatchewan, has become eutrophic, subsaline (salinity between 0.5 and 3.0 g l(-1)) and contaminated with several metals over the last decade. In this study, the crustacean zooplankton community in the lake in early summer 1989 is compared to the community during the early summers of the baseline years 1978 and 1979, based on archived environmental impact assessment samples. Community composition has changed, probably because of salinization and perhaps, to a lesser extent, eutrophication. Calanoid copepods have disappeared, while the numbers of species of cyclopoid copepods and cladocerans have increased. Ceriodaphnia reticulata, present in 1988 only, was more numerous than any other species during all three years. Densities of all other species were very low in 1989, which has led to lower diversity (Simpsons Index). Predation by Chaoborus probably contributed to the low abundances in 1989. The characteristics of the zooplankton community in 1989 were very similar to those of zooplankton in culturally acidified lakes, and indicate that Island Lake is in poor health. The success of Ceriodaphnia, a standard toxicity bioassay genus, is noteworthy under such contaminated conditions. While the taxonomic changes are obvious, the zooplankton data are limited; therefore causes can only be inferred. The study demonstrates the need for more and better ecosystem-specific biological information in order to do environmental impact assessments, in this case for mining in the north.																			0167-6369					JAN	1995	34	1					45	58		10.1007/BF00546245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00546245								24201907					WOS:A1995QM68700004
J	RUMYANTSEV, EA				RUMYANTSEV, EA			DIPLOSTOMOSIS OF FISHES IN LAKES AND ITS CONTROL	PARAZITOLOGIYA												Diplostomosis [caused by Diplostomum spathaceum, D. indistinctum and D. commutatum] is the most common disease affecting Coreganidae in lakes of Karelia [USSR] where intensive fish farming is conducted. The most acute of diplostomosis, cercariosis, is especially dangerous and can result when larvae are introduced into small water bodies. Depending on the season or weather conditions the infection rate of fish varies. Measures for control of diplostomatosis were suggested. Relatively shallow lakes with low sulfate concentrations were most suitable for Coregonidae nurseries, and the intensive use of lakes for fish farming offers possibilities for diplostomosis development. In lake-nurseries with a regulated water regime the abundance of Lymnaeidae can be reduced by winter draining off the water. The chemical control of mollusks by local use of copper sulfate is possible under lake conditions.																			0031-1847						1978	12	6					487	492																WOS:A1978GE52100004

Source apportionment of surface ozone in the Yangtze River Delta, China in the summer of 2013	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												We applied ozone source apportionment technology (OSAT) with tagged tracers coupled within the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) to study the region and source category contribution to surface ozone in the Yangtze River Delta area in summer of 2013. Results indicate that the daytime ozone concentrations in the YRD region are influenced by emissions both locally, regionally and super-regionally. At urban Shanghai, Hangzhou and Suzhou receptors, the ozone formation is mainly VOC-limited, precursor emissions form Zhejiang province dominate their O-3 concentrations. At the junction area among two provinces and Shanghai city, the ozone is usually influenced by all the three areas. The daily max O-3 at the Dianshan Lake in July are contributed by Zhejiang (48.5%), Jiangsu (11.7%), Anhui (11.6%) and Shanghai (7.4%), long-range transport constitutes around 20.9%. At Chongming site, the BVOC emissions rate is higher than urban region. Regional contribution results show that Shanghai constitutes 15.6%, Jiangsu contributes 16.2% and Zhejiang accounts for 25.5% of the daily max O-3. The analysis of the source category contribution to high ozone in the Yangtze River Delta region indicates that the most significant anthropogenic emission source sectors contributing to O-3 pollution include industry, vehicle exhaust, although the effects vary with source sector and selected pollution episodes. Emissions of NOx and VOCs emitted from the fuel combustion of industrial boilers and kilns, together with VOCs emissions from industrial process contribute a lot to the high concentrations in urban Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai. The contribution from regional elevated power plants cannot be neglected, especially to Dianshan Lake. Fugitive emissions of volatile pollution sources also have certain contribution to regional O-3. These results indicate that the regional collaboration is of most importance to reduce ambient ozone pollution, particularly during high ozone episodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	MUNDAHL, ND				MUNDAHL, ND			NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF FOODS CONSUMED BY GIZZARD SHAD IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) were collected from four locations in western Lake Erie during summer, 1982. The nutritional quality of foods ingested by these fish was examined. Small (< 60 mm standard length), age 0 fish consumed mostly zooplankton with high organic (> 80% of dry weight) and nitrogen (>6% of dry weight) contents. The phytoplankton and detritus diets of larger, age 0 and adult gizzard shad were of poorer nutritional quality (organic = 10-30%; nitrogen = 0.7-3.1% of dry weight). However, the nutritional quality of these foods was apparently adequate for gizzard shad, as most fish from all locations exhibited good condition and rapid growth rates. Observed differences in size and condition of age 0 gizzard shad among the collection sites may be due, in part, to variation in the quality of foods consumed during the growing season.																			0030-0950					JUN	1988	88	3					110	113																WOS:A1988N948800009

Water samples from the lake were collected at various seasons, and changes in various physicochemical parameters and microbial status were evaluated. Most significantly, the efficacy of the microflora associated with water-forming biofouling or biofilm network on its susceptibility to the ethanolic extract of A. indica was investigated. Distinct changes were recorded in all the tested physico-chemical and microbiological statuses in all the seasons. The efficacy of biofouling or biofilm network formation was found to be statistically high during the winter season. Biofouling or biofilm formation was susceptible to the ethanolic extract of A. indica. A. indica treatment brought about notable changes in the morphology of the biofouling networks. A. indica bioactive compounds such as 9,10-dideutero octadecanal and cyclononasiloxane, octadecamethyl known for their antimicrobial and in vitro properties, effectively prevented biofilm and biofouling formation.					; Karthick Raja Namasivayam, Dr.S./B-9625-2011	, Dr.S.

J	NEUMANN, J				NEUMANN, J			CLIMATIC CHANGES IN EUROPE AND THE NEAR-EAST IN THE 2ND MILLENNIUM BC	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The old pollen-analysis based picture of the climatic epoch Sub-Boreal in Europe, 3000 or 2500 to 800 BC, which embraces the second millenium, is in need of a thorough revision in light of the relatively recent researches in the Alps. The researches of concern are glacial-variation studies, mainly of the 1970s, and tree-ring density analyses of the subalpine zone of the late 1970s, reported in 1982. The results indicate that, after a warm and dry epoch ending about 1800 or 1700, a cold period set in in the Alps, lasting to about 1470 BC. (All dates below are BC unless otherwise stated, datings determined by radiocarbon analyses are subject to a maximum possible error of + or - 100 yrs.) This cold phase was followed by an approximately 70 yrs long warm phase. But the most pronounced change occurred about 1400, when rather abruptly a second cold phase was ushered in, continuing until about 1230. This second cold phase is often referred to under the name 'Lobben Phase', which is considered to have been the coldest and longest-sustained cold period of the past 8000 yrs, colder than the recent Little Ice Age of the CE (= Christian Era). Its temperature level is estimated (by G. Patzelt) to have been 0.7 to 1-degrees-C colder than the present level in the Alps. The rise of level of the Swiss lakes, including Lake Constance testify that the Lobben Phase was associated with an enhanced rainfall. In the 13th and the beginning of the 12th centuries major and violent migrations took place from central Europe, including Hungary, and the southeast of the continent toward the south and the southeast, including the Near East as far as the Nile Delta. In order to elucidate if the cold-wet phases of the Alps were cold-wet in central Europe, we have carried out air temperature correlations between an Alpine station Santis (2500 m MSL) and Budapest, for 1921-70. The correlation coefficient is 0.70 for the annual temperatures and 0.82 for July-September of the same years. Since glaciers grow in cold-wet summers, the high correlation for the summer months means that central Europe must have been cold in most of the cold summers of the Alps. But, cold, and especially cold-wet summers are detrimental to agriculture. Presumably, partial or total crop failures must have been relatively frequent in central Europe forcing the people to take to migration. Archeological evidence from Hungary indicates that there were hardly any settlements left, compared with the previous centuries. Finally, we quote evidence to show that some of the groups of the Sea Peoples, who tried to invade the Nile Delta about 1190, were of European origin. They abandoned their 'homeland', presumably because of a turn of the climate to cooler and wetter conditions. It is noted that our interpretation of the causes of migrations of the 13th century and beginning of the 12th, is different from that put forward by Weiss (1982).																			0165-0009					MAR	1993	23	3					231	245		10.1007/BF01091617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01091617													WOS:A1993KT75600003

However, knowledge of New Jersey freshwater phytoplankton assemblages is very limited. We collected a total of 196 samples between June and October each year from 2016 to 2019 and analyzed them for water-quality parameters, microcystins, and phytoplankton community composition. We documented a total of 91 phytoplankton taxa. The cyanophytes were the most dominant phytoplankton group statewide and by ecoregion, with Synechococcus being the most frequently observed cyanophyte. Fluorescence of phycocyanin significantly correlated with cyanobacterial cell density and microcystins, suggesting phycocyanin can be used as a proxy for estimating harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCB) conditions. The results of this study provide insight into the freshwater phytoplankton communities during the HCB season and their relationship with water-quality conditions in New Jersey.

Samples were analysed to assess their potability by estimating the level of heavy metals and bacterial (coliform and faecal coliform) contaminations. Iron was found in a maximum number (53%) of water samples from hand pumps, followed by lead in 43% of the tube wells, chromium in 16% of dug wells, cadmium in 13% of streams and manganese in 7% of hand pumps above their maximum admissible concentrations (MACs). Maximum metal pollution has been observed in a considerable number of water samples from Doda, followed by Almora, Mirzapur and Bankura. Hand pump water samples exhibited maximum metal pollution followed by dug well, spring, stream and river water samples. Contamination of coliform and/or faecal coliform bacteria ranged between 41% and 67% of water samples from open water sources but it was also less, i.e. 6-15% of water samples from tube wells and hand pumps. In general, 42-85% of water samples from districts surveyed, except from Jammu (18%) and Mirzapur (27%), were found to be bacteriologically unsatisfactory. Since toxic metals and pathogenic bacteria pose a risk to public health, monitoring of drinking water sources is required.

J	Kanner, MC; Cortes, L; Ibarra, Y				Kanner, Maura C.; Cortes, Luis; Ibarra, Yadira			Radiocarbon and stable isotope evidence of early to mid-Holocene wet events from fluvial tufa deposits in Santa Cruz, CA	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												It is increasingly important to document past records of hydrologic change in areas that are drought-prone to better predict the region's future vulnerability to recharge and water supply. Holocene spring-associated carbonate deposits serve as terrestrial records of water balance that can complement other local, high-resolution proxies that are moisture-sensitive. Here we examine two carbonate deposits (one inactive perched tufa site and one active fluvial tufa site) that form from ambient-temperature freshwater springs, as proxies of their depositional conditions. Radiocarbon (C-14) analyses of charcoal fragments from the inactive perched tufa record depositional ages of 6.2 +/- 0.06 (2 sigma) cal ka BP and 8.0 +/- 0.04 (2 sigma) cal ka BP and agree with the age models from other proxies of past pluvial periods in the region (similar to 16 to 5 ka). The active fluvial tufas date to 853 +/- 0.4 cal BP, representing conditions similar to modern flow. Geomorphologic and radiocarbon results indicate the perched tufa reflects wetter conditions fed by a higher water table. Stable isotopic analyses of carbonate (delta C-13, delta O-18) reveal distinct isotopic values between modern and early-mid-Holocene tufa. This work underscores potential for the analysis of other moisture-sensitive tufa deposits in coastal central California. (C) 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, the results of a high-resolution study of chironomid remains are presented, with a focus on the earlier part of Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 3 (60-50 kyr BP) covering four stadial/interstadial cycles. During the stadials, the chironomid fauna of the former lake was dominated by many cold-stenothermic chironomid taxa, indicating a cold, oligotrophic lake. The concentrations of chironomid remains were lower during the interstadials, and featured a higher number of warm-indicating taxa. This could have been the result of a higher summer temperature at the study site, but also of bottom-water anoxia, an increase in trophic state or a combination of all these factors. During the stadial intervals, a taxon that is restricted to (sub-)arctic environments is present in our record, suggesting a change in the temperature regime rather than in-lake processes as the driving mechanism for the changes in the chironomid record. Although, consistently, there was a response of the lake ecosystem to climate changes, the amplitude of this response was not constant. This study provides unique and independent evidence of the impact of Dansgaard/Oeschger climate variability on the European continent during the earlier part of OIS-3.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Engels, Stefan/0000-0002-2078-0361													0300-9483	1502-3885					2008	37	3					414	425		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00033.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00033.x													WOS:000257550400005

These flights have at times exceeded 10,000 birds/hr since their discovery in 2002, ranking the site among the continent's highest volume regular migratory songbird concentration locations. Migrants move in "reverse" direction northeastward up a peninsula in Lake Pontchartrain, and fly across a 9-km water gap to reach the north shore, usually struggling into a headwind. Flights are dominated by Yellow and Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica petechia and D. coronata), Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) during their respective migratory peaks. These species have exceeded 800 birds/hr, and 70 other small landbird species have been recorded. Flights of >100 birds/hr were more frequent after nights with more hours of northerly winds.

We conducted a pilot survey in Lake Erie (45 sites) in summer 2009. The US National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) was then conducted across the Great Lakes in summer 2010. The NCCA survey design provided statistically based estimates with defined uncertainty bounds for a variety of ecological indicators. For example, water quality (WQ) was measured (233 sampled sites) in the US nearshore, a resource defined with criteria to include waters to 30 m depth and less than 5 km from shore. A sub-resource of the US nearshore (151 separate sample sites) was defined using geometric criteria along the shoreline to identify small to medium embayment areas. Statistical analyses showed that embayments had higher Total Phosphorus and were more turbid than the open nearshore. We explored spatial variability in WQ results (2009, 2010) through regression analyses at multiple scales (within and across lakes) for nearshore and embayment resources. Empirical modeling identified principal drivers of spatial variability as risk factors for enrichment: water column depth and a landscape disturbance metric representing agricultural intensity as an indicator of watershed nutrient loading. Eutrophic nearshore conditions occurred at the upper end of an associated landscape disturbance gradient across watersheds of the US basin, peaking in Lake Erie. Overall results were consistent with the principles of classical limnology theory and demonstrated that a statistical survey approach can contribute to Great Lakes nearshore assessment and research.

Geochemical evidence for hydroclimatic variability over the last 2460 years from Crevice Lake in Yellowstone National Park, USA	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					22nd Pacific Climate Workshop	MAR 26-29, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA					A 2460-year-long hydroclimatic record for Crevice Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Montana was constructed from the delta O-18 values of endogenic carbonates. The delta O-18 record is compared to the Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices, as well as inferred discharge of the Yellowstone River. During the last century, high delta O-18 values coincide with drought conditions and the warm phase of the PDO index. Low delta O-18 values coincide with wet years and a negative PDO index. Comparison of tree-ring inferred discharge of the Yellowstone River with the delta O-18 record over the last 300 years indicates that periods of high discharge (i.e., wet winters with significant snow pack) correspond with low delta O-18 values. Extrapolating this relationship we infer wet winters and high river discharge for the periods of 1090-1030, 970-870, 670-620, and 500-430 cal years BP. The wet intervals at 670 and 500 cal BP are synchronous with similar events in Banff, Canada and Walker Lake, Nevada. The wet intervals at 970 and 670 cal BP overlap with wet intervals at Walker Lake and major drought events identified in the western Great Basin. These results suggest that the northern border of Yellowstone National Park straddles the boundary between Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Basin climate regimes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	HEATH, RT				HEATH, RT			DISSOLVED ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS-COMPOUNDS - DO THEY SATISFY PLANKTONIC PHOSPHATE DEMAND IN SUMMER	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The rate of release of phosphate from dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) compounds generally accounted for < 1% of the phosphate uptake rate by seston in the open water of five diverse freshwater systems in summer. Surface water samples were taken during July and August 1984 from a eutrophic lake (East Twin Lake, [Ohio, USA]), an acid bog lake (Triangle Bog Lake, [Ohio]), a freshwater estuarine marsh that empties into the western basin of Lake Erie (Old Woman Creek, [Ohio]), and two large mainstem reservoirs on the Savannah River (R. B. Russel Reservoir and Clarks Hill Lake, [Georgia]). In each of these, phosphatase hydrolysable phosphomonoesters (PME) often were the major fraction of DOP; phosphate release from photosensitive DOP was not detected in any of these systems at this time. The rate of release of phosphate from PME was calculated from Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and phosphatase activity was estimated spectrophotometrically using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a model substrate. Radiometric analysis of the rate of phosphate uptake by seston showed that phosphate was sorbed to seston by at least two different processes. The total uptake rate by all uptake processes exhibited an apparent first-order dependence on the concentration of available phosphate. Typically, the velocity of uptake was 1-10 nmol .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. min-1, and the velocity of release from PME was 0.01-0.06 nmol .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. min-1.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1986	43	2					343	350		10.1139/f86-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-044													WOS:A1986A159800013

In summers of 2008 and 2009, we felled 72 pines of approximately 65 years age. Sections of the logs were incubated in insect emergence traps. The trees located near lakes were significantly less infested by xylophagous insects than those sampled at greater distances from the lakes. We also tested the ability of Tomicus piniperda, the most abundant species of xylophagous insects in our samples, to resist the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. The results show that beetles captured near lakes were more susceptible to the fungal infection than individuals sampled away from forest lakes, indicating that the beetles far from lakes afforded to invest more in immunity during the larval phase. During the warmest days in summer the mean maximum ambient temperature was 2.32 degrees C lower near lakes than away from lakes. Since increased temperatures not only trigger drought stress, but may potentially also cause temperature-sensitive mortality of conifers, a warmer microclimate may lower resistance of pine trees to attacks of xylophagous beetles. In weakened trees, insects can invade more easily resulting in increased investment in immunity in bark- and wood-boring insects. This is the first demonstration of drought-induced positive feedback in xylophagous insects infesting Scots pine. Since bark beetles are common pests of conifers, our results may be important in forest pest management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In aquatic environments, As occurs as a mixture of arsenate and arsenite, with arsenate usually predominating. The unrestricted application of As pesticides, industrial activities, and mining operations has led to the global occurrence of soluble As above permissible levels of 0.010 mg/L. Continuous exposure of freshwater organisms including fish to low concentrations of As results in bioaccumulation, notably in liver and kidney. As a consequence As induces hyperglycemia, depletion of enzymatic activities, various acute and chronic toxicity, and immune system dysfunction. Here we review arsenic chemistry, the occurrence of arsenic in aquatic system, the transformation and metabolism of arsenic; arsenic bioaccumulation and bioconcentration; behavioral changes; and acute and other effects such as biochemical, immunotoxic, and cytogenotoxic effects on fish.

The number of phytoplankton species increased during the fall season. The most dominant group was Chlorophyta (21 taxa), followed by Cyanobacteria (5 taxa), and Charophyta (5 taxa). Pediastrum boryanum, Scenedesmus communis, Golenkinia paucispina, Pediastrum duplex, Kirchneriella contorta, and Cosmarium leaves were the frequently found taxa which were closer to the center of CCA ordination. The first two axes of CCA explained 91.2% of the correlation between species and environmental variables and 17.9% of cumulative variance of species data. Explanatory factors (dissolved oxygen, temperature, PH, and redox potential) played a significant role in the distribution of species. According to the results of WA, phytoplankton species had different ecological preferences at different environmental conditions. Commonly recorded phytoplankton taxa with cosmopolitan characteristics had a relatively high tolerance and broad optimum ranges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Manga, M; Patel, A; Dufek, J				Manga, Michael; Patel, Ameeta; Dufek, Josef			Rounding of pumice clasts during transport: field measurements and laboratory studies	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Volcanic clasts in many pyroclastic density current deposits are notably more round than their counterparts in corresponding fall deposits. This increase in roundness and sphericity reflects different degrees of comminution, abrasion and breakup during transport. We performed experimental measurements to determine an empirical relationship between particle shape and mass loss caused by particle-particle interactions. We consider, as examples, pumice from four volcanoes: Medicine Lake, California; Lassen, California; Taupo, New Zealand; Mount St Helens, Washington. We find that average sample roundness reaches a maximum value once particles lose between 15% and 60% of their mass. The most texturally homogeneous clasts (Taupo) become the most round. Crystal-rich pumice abrades more slowly than crystal-free pumice of similar density. Abrasion rates also decrease with time as particles become less angular. We compare our experimental measurements with the shapes of clasts in one of the May 18, 1980 pyroclastic density current units at Mount St Helens, deposited 4-8 km from the vent. The measured roundness of these clasts is close to the experimentally determined maximum value. For a much smaller deposit from the 1915 Lassen eruption, clast roundness is closer to the value for pumice in fall deposits and suggests that only a few volume percent of material was removed from large clasts. In neither field deposit do we see a significant change in roundness with increasing distance from the vent. We suggest that this trend is recorded because much of the rounding and ash production occur in proximal regions where the density currents are the most energetic. As a result, all clasts that are deposited have experienced similar amounts of comminution in the proximal region, and similar amounts of abrasion as they settle through the dense, near-bed region prior to final deposition.

J	Gillette, DA; Niemeyer, TC; Helm, PJ				Gillette, DA; Niemeyer, TC; Helm, PJ			Supply-limited horizontal sand drift at an ephemerally crusted, unvegetated saline playa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A site at Owens Dry Lake was observed for more than 4 years. The site was a vegetation-free saline playa where the surface formed "ephemeral crusts," crusts that form after rainfall. Sometimes these crusts were destroyed and often a layer of particles on the crust would engage in vigorous aeolian activity. Three "phases" of active sand drifting are defined as almost no movement (extreme supply limitation), loose particles on crust with some degree of sand drift (moderate supply limitation), and unlimited source movement corresponding to a destroyed surface crust (unlimited supply). These "phases" occurred 45, 49, and 6% of the time, respectively. The accumulation of loose particles on the crust was mostly the result of in situ formation. Crusted sediments with loose particles on top can exhibit mass flux rates about the same as for noncrusted sediments. Crusted sediments limit or eliminate sand drift in two conditions: for rough crusts that effect a sufficiently high threshold friction velocity (above the wind friction velocity) and for limited amounts of loose particles on the crust where particle supply is less than would be transported in normal saltation for a thick sandy surface. These "supply-limited" cases are similar to wind erosion of limited spilled material on a hard concrete surface. We quantified "Supply limitation" by defining a "potential" or "supply unlimited" sand drift function Q = AG where A represents supply limitation that decreases as the particle source is depleted. Here Q is the mass of sand transported through a surface perpendicular to the ground and to the wind and having unit width during time period t, and G = integral u(*)(u(*)(2) - u(*t)(2)) dt for u(*) > u(*t). G is integrated for the same time period t as for Q, u(*) is the friction velocity of the wind, and u(*t) is the threshold friction velocity of the wind. Hard crusts (usually formed in the summer) tended to show almost no change of threshold friction velocity with time and often gave total protection from wind erosion. Rough crusts provided sufficient protection expressed as high threshold friction velocities. For these high threshold friction velocities, aeolian activity was greatly reduced or practically prevented. The softest crusts, usually formed in the winter, provided much less protection and sometimes were destroyed by the wind. Following this destruction the "potential" or "supply unlimited" sand drift would be observed.

J	Scheuerell, MD; Schindler, DE				Scheuerell, MD; Schindler, DE			Diel vertical migration by juvenile sockeye salmon: Empirical evidence for the antipredation window	ECOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic organisms, yet the adaptive significance of this behavior is still unclear. In particular, diel vertical migration by juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) has received considerable attention. We studied how changes in the light environment affect juvenile sockeye DVM in Alaskan lakes through changes in foraging rates and predation risk. Using hydroacoustics to track temporal changes in fish distribution, we found clear patterns of DVM and a strong, significant correlation between the mean depth of the sockeye and the amount of light at the lake surface. However, we could not detect diel changes in the depth distribution of fish large enough to be sockeye predators. Given a lack of diel vertical migration in the zooplankton community, it appears that juvenile sockeye were not simply tracking their food supply. Calculations of the in situ light experienced by individual juvenile sockeye suggested that they migrate to maintain a constant light environment. This light environment allowed the sockeye to exploit an antipredation window whereby they could forage on zooplankton while reducing the odds of visual detection by their predators. Furthermore, this antipredation window was continuous in early summer, but was split into two discrete time periods during the crepuscular hours in late summer. These data support the hypothesis that changes in habitat use by juvenile sockeye salmon reflect a dynamic strategy to minimize the ratio of predation risk to foraging gain that changes dramatically over the course of diel cycles in pelagic ecosystems.

J	Austin, JA; Hrabik, TR; Branstrator, D				Austin, Jay A.; Hrabik, Thomas R.; Branstrator, Donn			An abrupt decline in springtime zooplankton diel vertical migration due to a shift in stratification regime	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Returned signal strength intensity measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler deployed at an open-water site in Lake Superior from May-July 2019 were used to estimate the scattering intensity over the top 50 m of the water column. It displayed a strong diel signal, with higher scattering intensity at night, consistent with the normal diel vertical migration of planktonic organisms. However, the intensity of the nocturnal scattering signal decreased abruptly on 10 June, coincident with the end of winter stratification (cold water on top of warmer water) and the beginning of the neutrally stratified period. We hypothesize that the sudden change in zooplankton behavior is due the availability of phytoplankton deep in the water column after the transition, made possible by radiatively driven convection mixing the entire water column on time scales of hours.

Environmental and Biological Influences on Carbonate Precipitation Within Hot Spring Microbial Mats in Little Hot Creek, CA	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial mats are found in a variety of modern environments, with evidence for their presence as old as the Archean. There is much debate about the rates and conditions of processes that eventually lithify and preserve mats as microbialites. Here, we apply novel tracer experiments to quantify both mat biomass addition and the formation of CaCO3. Microbial mats from Little Hot Creek (LHC), California, contain calcium carbonate that formed within multiple mat layers, and thus constitute a good test case to investigate the relationship between the rate of microbial mat growth and carbonate precipitation. The laminated LHC mats were divided into four layers via color and fabric, and waters within and above the mat were collected to determine their carbonate saturation states. Samples of the microbial mat were also collected for 16S rRNA analysis of microbial communities in each layer. Rates of carbonate precipitation and carbon fixation were measured in the laboratory by incubating homogenized samples from each mat layer with delta C-13-labeled HCO3- for 24 h. Comparing these rates with those from experimental controls, poisoned with NaN3 and HgCl2, allowed for differences in biogenic and abiogenic precipitation to be determined. Carbon fixation rates were highest in the top layer of the mat (0.17% new organic carbon/day), which also contained the most phototrophs. Isotope-labeled carbonate was precipitated in all four layers of living and poisoned mat samples. In the top layer, the precipitation rate in living mat samples was negligible although abiotic precipitation occurred. In contrast, the bottom three layers exhibited biologically enhanced carbonate precipitation. The lack of correlation between rates of carbon fixation and biogenic carbonate precipitation suggests that processes other than autotrophy may play more significant roles in the preservation of mats as microbialites.					; Spear, John/ABI-5873-2020; Stevenson, Bradley/A-2786-2011; Stamps, Blake/H-9781-2019; Dillon, Megan/U-8656-2019	Wilmeth, Dylan/0000-0002-6299-6267; Stamps, Blake/0000-0001-9713-9014; Stevenson, Bradley/0000-0001-9432-9744; Dillon, Megan/0000-0002-5706-6989; Spear, John/0000-0002-4664-7438; 													1664-302X					JUL 13	2018	9								1464	10.3389/fmicb.2018.01464	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01464								30057571					WOS:000438513700001

They have also been shown to be amongst the most prolific sources of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs; pentacyclic triterpenoids produced by taxa within the bacterial domain and especially in the proteobacteria) and are considered to be the most environmentally significant source of C-2 methylated hopanoids. The compounds therefore have the potential for wide application in studies of the contemporary marine carbon cycle as well as providing a means of tracking cyanobacteria back through geological history where organic matter is well preserved. Here, we have used liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry to investigate the intact BHP distributions in cultured cyanobacteria (pure cultures and enrichment cultures) and in a variety of environmental settings. We present data on the detection and characterisation of BHP structures in 26 cultured cyanobacteria (ranging from marine and freshwater species to isolates from hydrothermal systems), 10 of which have not been tested for hopanoid production. Of the 58 strains of cyanobacteria studied to date, 49 have been shown to produce BHPs and 21 of them produce C-2 methylated BHPs. We show that, paradoxically, hopanoid production appears to be absent from the most prolific marine picocyanobacteria, although two important marine nitrogen fixing species, Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera, do produce BHPs. The diversity of BHP distributions in a range of environmental samples, including lake sediments, bacterial mats from lakes and hydrothermal springs, and samples from hot and cold deserts, including endoliths, hypoliths and small stromatolitic structures is also described.

J	Cooke, SJ; McKinley, RS				Cooke, SJ; McKinley, RS			Winter residency and activity patterns of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque), and common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., in a thermal discharge canal	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Radiotelemetry was used to examine the behavioural responses of fish to dynamic environmental and operating conditions in a fossil-generating power station discharge canal on Lake Erie. A series of seven underwater antennas continuously monitored the movements of 10 common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and 10 channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque), in the 550-m discharge canal between 23 December 1997 and 1 May 1998. Common carp residency values were higher (47.71 +/- 8.51%) than those of channel catfish (10.15 +/- 2.82%). While resident in the discharge canal, channel catfish spent more time in the upper reaches and were more active than carp. Carp spent more time in the lower reaches of the channel, and made more frequent movements between the canal and Lake Erie. Overall residency decreased significantly during the study period. Aside from significant negative correlations between common carp residency and daily mean influent temperature (r =-0.53), daily discharge mean (r = -0.30) and minimum water temperature (r = -0.47), and positive correlations to daily mean cooling water flow (r = 0.38), the activity and residency of tagged individuals were independent of environmental and operating conditions. There was no relationship between the total length of each fish, and any of the residency or activity indices.

J	Wu, JT; Chou, JW				Wu, JT; Chou, JW			Dinoflagellate associations in Feitsui Reservoir, Taiwan	BOTANICAL BULLETIN OF ACADEMIA SINICA												In Feitsui Reservoir, dinoflagellate association was composed of three species: Ceratium furcoides (Levander) Langhans, Peridinium bipes Stein, and P. umbonatum Stein var. umbonatum. The environmental factors affecting their occurrence were studied at eight sites in the reservoir between January 1990 and December 1994. The peak occurrence of dinoflagellates, at water temperatures between 24 and 26 degrees C, was related to the high watershed runoff due to monsoon rainfall in autumn. The abundance of dinoflagellates a as positively correlated with the concentrations of phosphorus, total organic carbon, bacterial number, and chemical as well as biochemical oxygen demand in the water. The decrease in dinoflagellate abundance since 1991 has been followed by the prevalence of nannoplankton such as cyanobacteria and green algae. This coincided well with the continuous increase in N-nutrients in waters, which favors the growth of nannoplankton. It is assumed that N-nutrients play a more important role than N-nutrients in regulating the succession of dinoflagellates in this reservoir.

The Reunion Subchron vegetation and climate history of the northeastern Russian Arctic inferred from the Lake El'gygytgyn pollen record	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The 318-m-thick sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn provides unique opportunities for a detailed examination of environmental changes during the Reunion Subchron polarity reversal event (2.1384-2.1216 Myr BP) in the northeastern Russian Arctic. The paper describes vegetation and climate fluctuations between similar to 2(.)15 and 2.10 Myr BP as inferred from palynological data. Biome reconstructions indicate that throughout this interval the tundra (TUND) biome generally has higher affinity scores as compared to cold steppe (STEP) or cold deciduous forest (CLDE). An exception is the climatic optimum between similar to 2.139 and 2.131 Myr BP, coinciding with Marine Isotope Stage 81 (approximately the Reunion Subchron), when the CLDE biome has the highest scores. Landscape-openness indices suggest that more closed vegetation characterized most of the interval between 2.146 and 2.127 Myr BP, when deciduous forest and shrubs expanded in the regional vegetation and climate was relatively warm and wet. Peaks in green algal colonies (Botryococcus) and Zygnema-type spores similar to 2.150-2.146, similar to 2.131-2.123, and similar to 2.112-2.102 Myr BP indicate expansions of shallow-water habitats and lowered lake levels. Comparisons with biome reconstructions from other interglacial intervals at Lake El'gygytgyn suggest that precession-related summer insolation intensity and obliquity-related duration of summer daylight are major controls on the onset of interglaciations, whereas obliquity probably plays a more significant role on vegetation succession at northern high latitudes during the Pleistocene.

Surface meltwater drainage and ponding on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, 1973-2019	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Surface melting on Amery Ice Shelf (AIS), East Antarctica, produces an extensive supraglacial drainage system consisting of hundreds of lakes connected by surface channels. This drainage system forms most summers on the southern portion of AIS, transporting meltwater large distances northward, toward the ice front and terminating in lakes. Here we use satellite imagery, Landsat (1, 4 and 8), MODIS multispectral and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar to examine the seasonal and interannual evolution of the drainage system over nearly five decades (1972-2019). We estimate seasonal meltwater input to one lake by integrating output from the regional climate model [Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO 2.3p2)] over its catchment defined using the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica. We find only weak positive relationships between modeled seasonal meltwater input and lake area and between meltwater input and lake volume. Consecutive years of extensive melting lead to year-on-year expansion of the drainage system, potentially through a link between melt production, refreezing in firn and the maximum extent of the lakes at the downstream termini of drainage. These mechanisms are important when evaluating the potential of drainage systems to grow in response to increased melting, delivering meltwater to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to hydrofracture.					; van Wessem, Melchior/AAB-1987-2019	Creyts, Timothy/0000-0003-1756-5211; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				DEC	2021	67	266					985	998	PII S0022143021000460	10.1017/jog.2021.46	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2021.46													WOS:000721347700004
J	HelyHutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH				HelyHutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH			The anatomy of a flash flood in the Hartbeespoort catchment	WATER SA												As in many other semi-arid regions, rainfall in northern South Africa is erratic in both space and time. In response to such rainfall runoff in the Hartbeespoort catchment tends to be flashy, particularly runoff arising from rain falling on paved surfaces in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg. A specific flash flood was monitored from the originating storm down to the dissipation of the underflow in the lake. The storm was fairly typical of the region. Owing to low pondage in the channel the velocities of the surge and current were almost equal and the hydrograph at the lower end of the channel could be derived by a simple model from those higher up. Two distinct silt loads were generated by the flood, the first probably containing larger particles eroded from around the channel and the second containing smaller particles eroded from the ground upon which the rain had fallen. The second silt load appeared to aggregate a large proportion of the chemicals dissolved in the river and to lead to a density current which produced anomalies in the normal current and temperature profiles. The underflowing flood-water displaced the water resident in the drowned river channel well down into the lake, but entrained sufficient upper-level water during its passage to warm it to a temperature which prevented it from reaching the deepest parts of the lake.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	1997	23	4					345	356																WOS:A1997YL20300008

Seston delta(15)N values in Arbutus Lake averaged 2.5 +/- 0.18 parts per thousand (mean +/- SE) and 2.7 +/- 0.15 parts per thousand at 2 and 6 m depth, respectively. NO3- concentrations in Arbutus Lake were generally low (range 0-13 mu M) with greatly decreased concentrations during the summer; temporal changes in seston delta(15)N values and water column NO3- concentrations were inversely correlated. NO3- concentrations in Dart's Lake were higher (range 12.9- 22.4 mu M) and the magnitude of the decreased summer NO3- concentration lower. Seston delta(15)N values in Dart's Lake averaged 1.3 +/- 0.12 and 1.1 +/- 0.07 parts per thousand at depths of 6 and 14 m, respectively. There was no significant correlation between seston delta(15)N values and water column NO3- concentration in Dart's Lake. Average seston delta(13)C values in Arbutus Lake and Dart's Lake were -29.8 and -28.7 parts per thousand, respectively. More information about the distribution of stable isotopes for a wide variety of freshwater systems is needed to increase our understanding of the patterns observed in this study.																			0706-652X					NOV	1999	56	11					2186	2192		10.1139/cjfas-56-11-2186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-11-2186													WOS:000083547400022
J	HANSEN, B; CHRISTOFFERSEN, K				HANSEN, B; CHRISTOFFERSEN, K			SPECIFIC GROWTH-RATES OF HETEROTROPHIC PLANKTON ORGANISMS IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE DURING A SPRING BLOOM	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The in situ growth of the dominating pelagic organisms at several trophic levels was investigated during a spring bloom characterized by well-mixed cold water. The study includes primary production and the carbon flow through the nano-, micro- and mesozooplankton populations based on population dynamics and specific growth rates. The phytoplankton biomass and production were totally dominated by small algae <20 mu m, of which similar to 5% were <3 mu m, potentially a food source for the nano- and microzooplankton. The mean carbon-specific primary production was 0.15 day(-1) and was regulated solely by light. The mean volume-based specific growth rate of bacterioplankton was modest, 0.1 day(-1), and probably controlled by the low temperature. The volume-based specific growth rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers and copepods were 0.35, 0.13, 0.16 and 0.03 day(-1), respectively. The observed growth of the heterotrophic plankton was generally not food limited, but was controlled by temperature. The stable temperature during the experiment therefore allows a cross-taxonomic comparison of specific growth rates. The b exponent in the allometric relationship (G = aV(b)) between volume-specific growth rate (G) and individual body size (V) was -0.15 +/- 0.03 for all filtrating zooplankton, indicating an in situ scaling not far from the physiological principles originally demonstrated for laboratory populations.

J	WOTTON, RS				WOTTON, RS			LAKE OUTLET BLACKFLIES - THE DYNAMICS OF FILTER FEEDERS AT VERY HIGH POPULATION-DENSITIES	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												Larvae of the blackfly Simulium noelleri aggregated at very high population densities (up to 1.2 .times. 106 individuals m-2) at a lake outlet in Kent, United Kingdom. During 1983 and 1984 their first appearance in these large numbers was in late-June and they completed three summer generations before the overwintering larval generation appeared in October. It is now known where the larvae overwinter but they recolonized the concrete steps of this outlet in May, together with larvae of the S. ornatum group which, however, were not found after completing one generation at this location. Female flies from the overwintering generation oviposited en masse during late-June and the result was a well-synchronized growth of larvae in the first summer generation. Within this, and other generations, there was a wide range of emergence times for adults; they could emerge early and were then relatively small, or could emerge later and were then relatively large. Females were always larger than males and the emergence of flies was protandrous. A very similar pattern of growth and emergence times was found at a site in Finland. In all generations, sex ratio was biased to males and the sex ratio in each generation was inversely correlated with population density. This ensured that there were sufficient males emerging, and surviving adult mortality, to guarantee fertilisation of the females which were more expensive to produce.																			0105-9327					MAR	1987	10	1					65	72																WOS:A1987H170300010

The appearance of the reduced species over the course of the stagnation period corresponds qualitatively to the thermodynamic redox sequence, although no equilibrium is established between the various redox species and thus no single p-epsilon value can be defined. Occurrence of manganese(II) and the reduction of nitrate are predominant, while iron(II) and sulphide occur only at the last stage of stagnation. The concentration of manganese(II) near the sediment-water interface is limited by the solubility of MnCO3(s). The increase of alkalinity in the anoxic hypolimnion over stagnation time is related to the reduction of nitrate.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0304-4203					DEC	1991	36	1-4					9	26		10.1016/S0304-4203(09)90051-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-4203(09)90051-2													WOS:A1991HB94900003
J	Sousounis, PJ; Wallman, J; Mann, GE; Miner, TJ				Sousounis, PJ; Wallman, J; Mann, GE; Miner, TJ			"Hurricane Huron": An example of an extreme lake-aggregate effect in autumn	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												An intense cutoff low developed over the Great Lakes during the period 13-15 September 1996. The low developed as unseasonably cool air spread over the relatively warm water of the Great Lakes aggregate (i.e., all the Great Lakes). It eventually developed an eye, spiral rainbands, and a warm core, similar to those in a hurricane. This event presented some forecast challenges for the Nested Grid Model (NGM) and Eta Model and hence for the National Weather Service. The NGM model forecasted a weaker low (999 vs 993 hPa) to be centered east of the observed location, over Lake Huron. The Eta Model forecasted a slightly stronger low (991 vs 993 hPa) to be centered even farther east than did the NGM, over southern Ontario. As a result of the sea level pressure errors, both models also forecasted much weaker winds than were observed over the lakes and much less precipitation around the lakeshores. The coarse resolution in both models likely contributed significantly to these errors. With-lake (WL) and no-lake (NL) simulations were performed with the National Center for Atmospheric Research-Pennsylvania State University mesoscale model MM5 to determine the impacts of the Great Lakes on development of the low. The WL simulation agreed well with the observations. At the surface, the intensity and position of the WL low was within 1.7 hPa and 70 km at 30 h into the simulation (1800 UTC 14 September 1996), when the observed low was most intense. To the extent that the impact of the Great Lakes can be ascertained through comparison of the simulations, selected WL-NL differences at the surface revealed that the lakes deepened the WL low by similar to5-7 hPa and restricted its movement. A comparison of WL and NL simulations at upper levels revealed equally impressive differences (e.g., lake-induced perturbations). Strong negative (positive) height and meso-alpha -scale cyclonic (anticyclonic) wind perturbations at 850 (300) hPa support the hypothesis that the Great Lakes were instrumental in generating a warm core and strong winds near the surface. A comparison of WL-NL differences for this case are compared with those from a more typical wintertime case to illustrate that the WL-NL perturbations can be more intense and can extend to considerably greater depths than in typical winter cases. Strong latent heat fluxes, low static stability, and slow movement (e.g., the cut-off nature) of the synoptic-scale low allowed the strong heating and moistening from the Great Lakes to extend to midtropospheric levels for an extended period of time.

J	Chang, JC; Shulmeister, J; Woodward, C				Chang, Jie Christine; Shulmeister, James; Woodward, Craig			A chironomid based transfer function for reconstructing summer temperatures in southeastern Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present a new chironomid based temperature transfer function which was developed from a training set of 33 natural and artificial lakes from southeast Australia from subtropical Queensland to cool temperate Tasmania. Multivariate statistical analyses (CCA, pCCA) were used to study the distribution of chironomids in relation to the environmental and climatic variables. Seven out of eighteen available variables were significantly (p < 0.05) related to chironomid species variation and these were mean February temperature (9.5%), pH (9.5%), specific conductance (8.2%), total phosphorous (8%), potential evapotranspiration (8%), chlorophyll a (6.9%) and water depth (6.2%). Further pCCA analyses show that mean February temperature (MFT) is the most robust and independent variable explaining chironomid species variation. The best MFT transfer function was a partial least squares (PLS) model with a coefficient of determination (r(jackknifed)(2)) of 0.69, a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 233 degrees C, and maximum bias of 2.15 degrees C. Chironomid assemblages from actively managed reservoirs appear to match assemblages from equivalent natural lakes in similar climates and therefore can be included in the development of the chironomid transfer function. Although we cannot completely rule out some degree of endemism in the Tasmanian chironomid fauna, our analyses show that the degree of endemism is greatly reduced. Therefore, integrating the existing chironomid transfer function for Tasmania (Rees et al., 2008) with this new model is a real possibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Perch (Perca fluviatilis) was the most abundant species. Further species regularly encountered in the pelagic zone were zander (Stizostedion lucioperca), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and common bream (Abramis brama). Roach (Rutilus rutilus) was found in high numbers in the pelagic zone only in one of the investigated years. All three percids had an obligatory pelagic phase during early ontogeny. They disappeared from the pelagic zone at different lengths; perch at 30 mm, zander at 20 mm and ruffe at 10 mm. Cyprinids moved to the pelagic zone later, after spending some time at the spawning grounds. The typical succession of larvae and juveniles consisted of a May-June aspect, dominated by perch and zander, and a summer period, when ruffe and cyprinids were more important.

J	Rosqvist, GC; Schuber, P				Rosqvist, GC; Schuber, P			Millennial-scale climate changes on South Georgia, Southern Ocean	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The location of South Georgia (54degreesS, 36degreesW) makes it a suitable site for the study of the climatic connections between temperate and polar environments in the Southern Hemisphere. Because the mass balance of the small cirque glaciers on South Georgia primarily responds to changes in summer temperature they can provide records of changes in the South Atlantic Ocean and atmospheric circulation. We use grey scale density, weight-loss-on-ignition, and grain size analyses to show that the proportion of glacially eroded sediments to organic sediments in Block Lake was highly variable during the last 7400 cal yr B.P. We expect that the glacial signal is clearly detectable above noise originating from nonglacial processes and assume that an increase in glacigenic sediment deposition in Block Lake has followed Holocene glacier advances. We interpret proglacial lake sediment sequences in terms of summer climate warming and cooling events. Prominent millennial-scale features include cooling events between 7200 and 7000, 5200 and 4400, and 2400 and 1600 cal yr B.P. and after 1000 cal yr B.P. Comparison with other terrestrial and marine records reveals that the South Georgian record captures all the important changes in Southern Hemisphere Holocene climate. Our results reveal a tentative coupling between climate changes in the South Atlantic and North Atlantic because the documented temperature changes on South Georgia are anti-phased to those in the North Atlantic.

Delineation and functional status monitoring in small saline wetlands of NE Spain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The small playa-lakes and other saline wetlands of Monegros, scattered over a dry area with winter cereal monoculture, are threatened by the settlement of new irrigation districts and other kinds of human pressure. Enforcing the protection rules of European Union in these valuable habitats requires. first, their delimitation and monitoring. This article shows how these tasks can be undertaken using remote sensing in conjunction with field observations. A series of Landsat images covering different seasons provided a comprehensive view of these wetlands encompassing their changing facies, hydrologic regime, state of conservation. and functional status. Remotely-sensed data were the primary, and in most cases the only available, source of consistent information.

Modelling the enigmatic Late Pliocene Glacial Event - Marine Isotope Stage M2	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Pliocene Epoch (5.2 to 2.58 Ma) has often been targeted to investigate the nature of warm climates. However, climate records for the Pliocene exhibit significant variability and show intervals that apparently experienced a cooler than modern climate. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2 (similar to 3.3 Ma) is a globally recognisable cooling event that disturbs an otherwise relatively (compared to present-day) warm background climate state. It remains unclear whether this event corresponds to significant ice sheet build-up in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Estimates of sea level for this interval vary, and range from modern values to estimates of 65 m sea level fall with respect to present day. Here we implement plausible M2 ice sheet configurations into a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model to test the hypothesis that larger-than-modern ice sheet configurations may have existed at M2. Climate model results are compared with proxy climate data available for M2 to assess the plausibility of each ice sheet configuration. Whilst the outcomes of our data/model comparisons are not in all cases straight forward to interpret, there is little indication that results from model simulations in which significant ice masses have been prescribed in the Northern Hemisphere are incompatible with proxy data from the North Atlantic, Northeast Arctic Russia, North Africa and the Southern Ocean. Therefore, our model results do not preclude the possibility of the existence of larger ice masses during M2 in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. Specifically they are not able to discount the possibility of significant ice masses in the Northern Hemisphere during the M2 event, consistent with a global sea-level fall of between 40 m and 60 m. This study highlights the general need for more focused and coordinated data generation in the future to improve the coverage and consistency in proxy records for M2, which will allow these and future M2 sensitivity tests to be interrogated further.

Eutrophication and subsequent seasonal blooms of harmful cyanobacteria (Hcy), predominantly Microcystis, are usual during high-temperature seasons in the Daechung Reservoir, in Korea. Therefore, much effort has been put into monitoring and improving the water quality of the Daechung Reservoir, with a major focus on Hcy. However, little attention has been paid to Pcy, partly because the cell identification and enumeration methods are unable to detect them. Herein, the appearance patterns of Pcy and Hcy are identified via next-generation sequencing and flow cytometry. The results indicate that Cyanobium dominates the upstream regions of Daechung Lake from June to July (Dominance ratios: 33.3 similar to 94.2%) and is succeeded by Microcystis from August to September (Dominance ratios: 38.6 similar to 89.7%). However, Microcystis is less evident in middle and downstream locations, and Cyanobium continues to dominate even in summer (average dominance ratio: 66.1%). Quantitative results indicate two periods (June-August and September-October) of high occurrences of Pcy at the upstream points (average cell density: 11,639 cells/mL), with Pcy and bloom-forming cyanobacteria increasing simultaneously in the summer. In the middle and downstream sites, however, the cell densities of Pcy are relatively low throughout the year (annual average cell density: 3451 cells/mL). High correlations are indicated between Pcy, water temperature, pH, and N-source nutrients, while Microcystis shows high positive correlations with phycocyanin concentration and P-sources nutrients. Therefore, a correlation analysis could be used to predict future blooms based on the appearance characteristics of Pcy and Hcy in freshwater ecosystems.

In this study, we presented a high-resolution precipitation record for the past similar to 1500 years, based on geochemical data from annually-laminated sediments of Lake Sihailongwan in central NE Asia. The results showed wetter conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). To further study the spatiotemporal patterns of hydroclimate variability in NE Asia over the last millennium, sixteen well-dated hydroclimate records for this region were collected and compared. The results showed that rainfall in central NE Asia was higher during the LIA than during the MCA, contrasting with the observed pattern in western NE Asia. The differences in precipitation may be attributed to the comprehensive impact of the northeast cold vortex (NECV) and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Modulated by variations in atmospheric circulation systems at middle to high latitudes, the weakening of the NECV led to decreased precipitation in central NE Asia during the MCA, while the strengthening of the NECV led to increased precipitation in this area during the LIA. Meanwhile, the increase in precipitation in western NE Asia during the MCA was linked to the strengthened EASM, while the decrease in precipitation in this area during the LIA was linked to the weakened EASM. The results of this study elucidate the potential role of the NECV in climate variability on centennial timescales.

Based on species occurrence data for four dominant species of Anatidae and environmental factors, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was used to analyze the suitability of habitats during five impoundment periods. The results show that the main factors affecting Anatidae distribution were temperature and roads before the Three Gorges Project (TGP) and elevation after the TGP. After the TGP, the area of the suitable habitat declined rapidly and then gradually increased with increasing water level. After impoundment, the primary area of increased habitat suitability was the main stream of the Yangtze River from Changshou District to Yunyang County and its tributary in the Kaizhou area. Among the habitats, the central water regions were more suitable than the marginal shoal areas. Anatidae habitats in the TGRR were distributed mainly within the Yangtze River main stream and the surrounding areas before the TGP, and the surrounding areas largely disappeared after the TGP, particularly in Chongqing City and Jiangjin District. In this context, it is challenging to create new protected areas within the habitat suitable for Anatidae in the main stream of the Yangtze River; we propose adding the Anatidae as conservation targets within the existing conservation agencies and implementing a waterbird monitoring program for scientific waterbird conservation and the sustainable development of the reservoir.

Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Mallards in Bulgaria	AVIAN DISEASES					7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza	APR 05-08, 2009	Univ Georgia, Athens, GA		Univ Georgia			Bulgaria has a unique geographic position in Europe, with two migratory wild bird routes, Via Pontica and Via Aristotelis, passing through the country. Via Pontica is the second-largest migration route in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of birds, representing more than 110 species, wintering in lakes by the Black Sea and the wetlands near the Danube River. Via Aristotelis is situated in West Bulgaria along the Strouma and Mesta river valleys, and it is of regional importance for the Balkan Peninsula. In this study, we examined more than 2000 samples from wild birds from the orders Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes, Gruiformes, and Charadriformes in the period 2006-2008. We isolated three influenza viruses, subtypes H4N6, H7N7, and H10N7, all from mallards, Arias platyrhynchos. The H7N7 was isolated from a hunter-killed mallard at the river bank of Kamchia (Via Pontica). The cleavage site sequence of the hemagglutinin gene in the H7N7 isolate was PEIPKGR*GLF, which is characteristic of a low-pathogenic virus. The H4N6 isolates belonged to a mallard wintering along the Maritza River (Via Aristotelis). We detected the H10N7 virus in samples from mallards that inhabit the Ogosta River, one of the feeders of the Danube (Via Pontica). All these viruses were detected during the active migration of the birds, February-March.																			0005-2086					MAR	2010	54	1		S			450	452		10.1637/8681-030709-ResNote.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8681-030709-ResNote.1								20521677					WOS:000276455300051

The climate parameters were estimated using the best modern analogue technique with an updated modern pollen-climate database composed of 2748 surface samples. The record shows two main cooling phases in the Maliq area (the Oldest and Younger Dryas) and a cooling event around 8200 years, which suggests that the forcing factors driving climate variations in the North Atlantic area since the Last Glacial period also extended their influence into the Mediterranean area. The Oldest and Younger Dryas are also characterized by an and climate and a change in the seasonality of precipitation: the summer precipitation tends to be greater during the cooling phases than during the temperate periods. The Holocene climate is relatively stable and the values of each parameter reach their modern levels, except for an and event between 8300 and 8100 cal BP. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

L. pneumophila apparently is part of the natural aquatic environment and the bacterium can survive extreme ranges of environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the direct fluorescent-antibody technique for detecting L. pneumophila in natural aquatic systems is demonstrated. Smears of the concentrated samples were screened microscopically for serogroups of L. pneumophila by the direct fluorescent-antibody technique. Virtually all of the 793 samples were positive by this method. The 318 samples containing the largest numbers of positive bacteria which were morphologically consistent with L. pneumophila were injected into guinea pigs for attempted isolations. Isolates were obtained from habitats with a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters. Samples collected monthly from a thermally altered lake and injected into guinea pigs demonstrated a seasonality of infection, with the highest frequency of infection occurring during the summer months.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1981	41	1					9	16		10.1128/AEM.41.1.9-16.1981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.41.1.9-16.1981								7013702					WOS:A1981KY96300002

Time resolved aerosol size distributions were measured during all storm periods from genesis to cessation at the township of Keeler, less than 1 km from the border of one of the dust-producing regions. The size distributions of aerosols showed a much greater concentration of soil elements in very fine modes than is usual in typical soils, with a PM10 mass median diameter in the 2.5-5 mum size range. Four meteorological stations on and around the lake, time lapse photography of the northern lake bed, and nephelometers located 100 km to the south allowed for the continuous monitoring of local meteorology as well as transport patterns during storm periods.

J	KING, RB				KING, RB			POPULATION ECOLOGY OF THE LAKE ERIE WATER SNAKE, NERODIA-SIPEDON-INSULARUM	COPEIA												Population ecology of the Lake Erie water snake, Nerodia sipedon insularum, is described based on a 5 yr capture-mark-recapture study involving 1449 captures of 1247 individuals. Water snakes are widespread in the island area of Lake Erie but have declined in numbers nd have disappeared from one island within the last 50 yr. Population estimates for adult snakes range from 25 to about 500 individuals on seven islands. Snakes are active from late April until early October. males are caught most often during the breeding season in May and June, while females are taken more often later in summer. Females appear to feed over a longer portion of the active season than males, grow at a faster rate (0.014 vs. 0.012 cm/d mean growth rate) and attain a larger body size (82.1 vs. 62.5 cm mean snout-vent length). Weight gain occurs throughout the active season in adult females but is restricted to mid-summer in adult males. Some females reproduce annually bur smaller females may skip opportunities to reproduce. Number and size of offspring are positively correlated with female size. Comparisons with data from mainland populations elsewhere in the range of this species indicate that island water snakes differ in having larger adult body sizes (mean snout-vent length is 10-16 cm greater in males and 13-14 cm greater in females), lower growth rates (maximum growth rate is 0.06 cm/d vs. 0.13 cm/d in mainland populations) and shorter tails (by 2-5% in males, 1-3% in females). In addition, litter size is less strongly correlated with female body size in island populations (r2 = 0.17 vs. 0.34-0.73 elsewhere). Differences may also exist in size of newborns (mean newborn SVL of mainland population ranges from 12% shorter to 4% longer than that of island populations, diet (mainland populations typically consume more amphibians and fewer fish) and intensity of predation (frequency of stub tails is two times greater in mainland populations).																			0045-8511	1938-5110				AUG 4	1986		3					757	772																WOS:A1986D601000021

Based on the fluvial geomorphic parameters and Landsat satellite images, it has been observed that the Kulsi River migrated 0.7-2 km westward in its middle course in the past 30 years. Geomorphic parameters such as longitudinal profile analysis, stream length gradient index (SL), ratio of valley floor width to valley height (Vf), steepness index (k(s)) indicate that the upstream segment of the Kulsi River is tectonically more active than the downstream segment which is ascribed to the tectonic activities along the Guwahati Fault. C-14 ages obtained from the submerged tree trunks of the Chandubi Lake, which is located in the central part of the Kulsi River catchment suggests inundation (high lake levels) during 160 +/- 50 AD, 970 +/- 50 AD, 1190 +/- 80 AD and 1520 +/- 30 AD, respectively. These periods broadly coincide with the late Holocene strengthened Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the early part of the Little Ice Age (LIA). The debris which clogged the course of the river in the vicinity of the Chandubi Lake is attributed to tectonically induced increase in sediment supply during high magnitude flooding events.

A two-layer discrimination was delineated in the water column of the lake, based on the correlations between environmental and biological descriptors and on the ciliated protozoa community composition. The latter showed a clear zonation pattern along the water column with two main recognizable facies: a superficial and a deep one. Choreotrichida and Strombidiida dominated the upper facies nearly throughout the study period, while Tintinnida were only found in summer months. The mixotrophic cyclotrichid Myrionecta rubra was also frequently observed in the upper facies. Typical of the deep facies was the occurrence of Pleuronematida (Cyclidium sp.) and of flagellates of the order Cryptomonadida (Chilomonas sp.), which were the main potential picoplankton grazers during a summer bloom of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. Sporadic inputs of Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) from the upwelling system of the Straits of Messina, although limited to the mixolimnion, clearly affected the physical and chemical environment, as well as the microbial biomass and the ciliated protozoa assemblage composition, all along the water column of the lake, suggesting that meromictic basins, although strongly stratified, may experience perturbation effects from the surface down to the bottom, with important consequences on their biogeochemical cycles and on their ecology.					; Sacca, Alessandro/G-9704-2013; Saccà, Alessandro/G-9704-2013	GUGLIELMO, Letterio/0000-0001-7547-8058; Sacca, Alessandro/0000-0002-7482-645X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	600						89	104		10.1007/s10750-007-9179-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9179-x													WOS:000253765200009

Here we present a high-resolution elemental record from Lake Gyaring in the source region of the Yellow River to investigate the paleo-hydroclimate changes over the past similar to 10 ka. Our results show that lithogenic elements (Ti, Rb, Mn, Ti, Zn and Ni) increased while carbonate-related elements (Ca, Sr and Mg) decreased up the core sediments, indicating that the effective moisture on the north-eastern TP has steadily increased throughout the Holocene. This inference is also supported by the gradual augmentation and diminution of Rb/Sr and Ca/(Ti + Fe + Al) ratios, respectively. The persistent wetting trend on the north-eastern TP inferred from our study disagrees with the Holocene pattern of the ASM but corresponds well with that of the Westerlies. This implies that the strengthening Westerlies since the Holocene might have played a more important role than monsoon circulation in controlling the hydroclimate changes on the north-eastern TP. However, the significant increase in the mid-Holocene might be related to the combined effects of the strengthened ASM and Westerlies. Ultimately, Northern Hemisphere solar insolation and the substantial remnant of ice sheets might have controlled Holocene moisture availability on the north-eastern TP through their influence on the intensity of the Westerlies and ASM as well as Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures.

D.			Flood Frequency Variability During the Past 80 Years in the Slave River Delta, NWT, as Determined from Multi-Proxy Paleolimnological Analysis	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												A paleolimnological approach was employed to reconstruct variations in the frequency of spring break-up flooding in the Slave River Delta during the past similar to 80 years based on multi-proxy analyses (geochemistry, diatoms, plant macrofossils) of a sediment core from a shallow, flood-prone lake in the active delta. Results reveal oscillating decadal-scale intervals of high and low flood frequency. The post-1960 reconstruction of Slave River flood frequency parallels variations in measured Slave River discharge and corresponds to the flood history derived from observations of land users. Notably, the interval of lowest water levels inferred from a peak sedimentary abundance of Sagittaria cuneata seeds pre-dates upstream regulation of the Peace River in 1968. Multi-proxy records reveal that the onset of river regulation coincided with a period of increased flood frequency beginning in the early 1960s and ending in the early 1980s. It is therefore unlikely that river regulation is the primary factor causing declines in the frequency of spring break-up floods at the study site. Furthermore, the flood record developed in the Slave River Delta parallels similar changes in flood frequency from an oxbow lake in the northern Peace sector of the upstream Peace-Athabasca Delta. This suggests that climate-driven change in the runoff regime of the upper Mackenzie River Basin is likely the principle driver of variability in flood frequency in both deltas. Continued reductions in snowpacks and headwater runoff are therefore likely to reduce the frequency of flooding in the Slave River Delta.					; Armitage, Derek/ABE-6315-2020; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Wesche, Sonia/0000-0002-8300-954X; Armitage, Derek/0000-0002-8921-1693; Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; 													0701-1784	1918-1817				FAL	2010	35	3					281	300		10.4296/cwrj3503281	http://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj3503281													WOS:000283806200004
J	SPILLER, GB; AUCLAIR, AND				SPILLER, GB; AUCLAIR, AND			A MATHEMATICAL-MODEL OF SEASONAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION IN PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKE MEMPHREMAGOG, QUEBEC	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A mathematical model was formulated to predict monthly and spatial changes in total phosphorus concentrations in the epilimnion of Lake Memphremagog, a long and narrow lake transversing the Canada-United States border. Computer experiments were designed to elucidate the phosphorus loading mechanisms and to assess the effects of tertiary treatment and increased cultural eutrophication. The initial model, based purely on two equations of advective transport, showed a rapid exponential decrease in total phosphorus from the source to the outlet. The pattern was similar to observed trends but predicted values were too low. Possible discrepancies due to (1) convectional mixing, (2) release of phosphorus from the lake sediments, and (3) particle size effects were examined. Characteristics of the model were evaluated using correlation, a ''predictability'' index, and simple differences between predicted and observed values. Simulations assuming 25% and 100% mixing of the water column predicted total phosphorus levels twice and 1.5 times greater than observed values, respectively. Correlations and predictability were low. Simulations assuming phosphorus release from the sediments (based on temperature and dissolved phosphorus functions reported in the literature) greatly improved the correspondence between measured and predicted values. Correlation and predictability were twice as high for the convectional model and three to ten times as high as for the initial run. Overall correlation and predictability also increased from the initial model if large particle size and rapid settling were assumed. Tertiary treatment resulted in a 49% reduction near the source and a 24% reduction at the far end of the lake. Little reduction occurred in the summer. A 20% increase in cultural eutropication indicated an annual average increase of 15% could be expected. Summer phosphorus levels increased 25% indicating the effect was concentrated in the growing season. Sensitivity analysis showed that phosphorus loading rate was more important than either sedimentation or phosphorus release rates. Halving each rate resulted in a 35, 34 and 17% change in average total phosphorus concentration.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				DEC	1986	34	3-4					143	166		10.1016/0304-3800(86)90001-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(86)90001-3													WOS:A1986G150900001

Saltwater ingressions to the lake were recognized by spatial and seasonal changes in the concentrations of chlorides in pore waters from the lake surface sediments. Temporal trends in SSI were reconstructed based on diatom proxies from a lake sediment core located within the range of saltwater ingressions. The data showed that subsurface saltwater input to Lake Sarbsko occurs during severe winter storms on the Baltic Sea, when saltwater is pumped to the lake from under the barrier separating the lake from the sea. Due to accelerated sea level rise, increased frequency of storms and lack of ice cover on the Baltic since at least the mid 20(th) century, saline groundwater supply to the lake has distinctly increased.					; Woszczyk, Michał/AAK-2933-2021; Rzodkiewicz (nee Lutyńska), Monika/KBD-2533-2024; Spychalski, Waldemar/JAC-9280-2023; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; Spychalski, Waldemar/0000-0002-9646-3039; Rzodkiewicz (Lutynska), Monika/0000-0002-6672-2183; 													1755-1307						2010	9								012013	10.1088/1755-1315/9/1/012013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/9/1/012013													WOS:000327134700013

Composition and secondary formation of fine particulate matter in the Salt Lake Valley: Winter 2009	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												Under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), put in place as a result of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990, three regions in the state of Utah are in violation of the NAAQS for PM10 and PM2.5 (Salt Lake County, Ogden City, and Utah County). These regions are susceptible to strong inversions that can persist for days to weeks. This meteorology, coupled with the metropolitan nature of these regions, contributes to its violation of the NAAQS for PM during the winter. During January-February 2009, 1-hr averaged concentrations of PM10-2.5, PM2.5, NOx, NO2, NO, O-3, CO, and NH3 were measured. Particulate-phase nitrate, nitrite, and sulfate and gas-phase HONO, HNO3, and SO2 were also measured on a 1-hr average basis. The results indicate that ammonium nitrate averages 40% of the total PM2.5 mass in the absence of inversions and up to 69% during strong inversions. Also, the formation of ammonium nitrate is nitric acid limited. Overall, the lower boundary layer in the Salt Lake Valley appears to be oxidant and volatile organic carbon (VOC) limited with respect to ozone formation. The most effective way to reduce ammonium nitrate secondary particle formation during the inversions period is to reduce NOx emissions. However, a decrease in NOx will increase ozone concentrations. A better definition of the complete ozone isopleths would better inform this decision. Implications: Monitoring of air pollution constituents in Salt Lake City, UT, during periods in which PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the NAAQS, reveals that secondary aerosol formation for this region is NOx limited. Therefore, NOx emissions should be targeted in order to reduce secondary particle formation and PM2.5. Data also indicate that the highest concentrations of sulfur dioxide are associated with winds from the north-northwest, the location of several small refineries.																			1096-2247	2162-2906					2014	64	8					957	969		10.1080/10962247.2014.903878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2014.903878								25185397					WOS:000340208600010

The abundance and spatial distribution of GSB were therefore addressed in 13 small humic lakes using fragment analysis and sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes. GSB were detected from lakes where the photosynthetically active radiation was at least 1.1 mu E m(-2) s(-1) at the oxicanoxic boundary layer. In these lakes, 13 to 42% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the anoxic water column were assigned to GSB. The spatial distribution of GSB was tightly correlated with the spectrophotometrically measured BChl concentration during the summer season. Maximum BChl concentrations were observed in the uppermost part of the anoxic water layer, covering most of the chlorophyll pigment in these lakes. The GSB of the humic lakes typically belonged to a phylogenetically homogenous group closely related to Chlorobium clathratiforme.

Two-year decomposition processes of needles and twigs of Chamaecyparis obtusa were examined at two sites, control site never colonized by the cormorants (site Q and colonizing site (site 2). Mass loss was faster in needles than in twigs. Mass loss of these litter types was faster at site C than at site 2, which was ascribed to the decreased mass loss rate of acid-insoluble 'lignin' at site 2. Net immobilization of N, P, and Ca occurred in needles and twigs at site 2; whereas at site C, mass of these elements decreased without immobilization during decomposition. Duration of immobilization phase of these nutrients at site 2 was estimated to be 1.6 to 2.5 years in needles and 19.6 to 23.5 years in twigs. Immobilization potential (maximum amount of exogenous nutrient immobilized per gram initial material) was similar between needles and twigs for N and Ca but was about 10 times higher in twigs than in needles for P. delta C-13 in needles was relatively constant during the first year and then increased during the second year, whereas delta C-13 in twigs was variable during decomposition. Acid-insoluble fraction was depleted in C-13 compared to whole needles (1.6-2.1 parts per thousand) and twigs (2.0-2.5 parts per thousand). delta N-15 of needles and twigs and their acid-insoluble fractions approached to delta N-15 of excreta during decomposition at site 2. This result demonstrated the immobilization of excreta-derived N into litter due to the formation of acid-insoluble lignin-like substances complexed with excreta-derived N. No immobilization occurred in K and Mg and their mass decreased during decomposition at both sites. Based on these results of nutrient immobilization during decomposition and on the data of litter fall and excreta amount at site 2, we tentatively calculated stand-level immobilization potential of litter fall and its contribution to total amount of N and P deposited as excreta. Thus, the potential maximum amount immobilized into litter fall (needles and twigs) was estimated to account for 5-7% of total excreta-derived N and P. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With respect to temperature, thermal stability and light availability in the water column, the specific growth responses detected in 1972 are shown to be strongly consistent with those in other years and in other lakes, yet the interspecific differences are preserved. The atypical seasonality of plankton observed in 1972 was brought about by the atypical sequence of atmospheric conditions that, in turn, modified the temporal phasing and subsequent stability of thermal stratification. These events demonstrate the importance of phytoplankton responses to physical variability of the environment.																			0007-1617						1985	20	3					227	242		10.1080/00071618500650241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618500650241													WOS:A1985AQP1100005

Here we present a detailed record of regional vegetation change based on high-resolution pollen records for the intervals 9000-7000 and 5000-3000 cal abpfrom the Hulun Lake region of north-eastern China. Our aims were to determine the regional expression of the 8.2- and 4.2-ka events in north-eastern China, especially their effects on vegetation composition. The results show that the response of the vegetation of the Hulun Lake region to the climatic cooling of the 8.2-ka event was relatively minor; however, the 4.2-ka event, which resulted in climatic aridification, resulted in pronounced vegetation degradation. We suggest that the specific characteristics of the 8.2- and 4.2-ka events, together with their duration and the regional climatic background on an orbital time scale, were the main factors responsible for the contrasting vegetation responses. The strengthening and northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) tended to offset the cooling effect of the 8.2-ka event on regional vegetation in the mid-high latitudes of East Asia; in contrast, the decrease in summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere and the southward shift of the ITCZ may have intensified the drought effect of the 4.2-ka event in East Asia and the associated vegetation degradation. Under future global warming scenarios, both extreme cooling events and extreme drought events may cause a deterioration of the ecological environment; however, the resulting regional vegetation responses may be substantially different.

Water temperature, pH and specific conductivity were measured in intervals of 5 and 30 min for periods of 1 to 2 days. From these data the concentrations of Ca2+, HCO3-, calcite saturation index, and CO2 partial pressure were derived. The measurements in the spring of the stream did not show any diurnal variations in the chemical composition of the water. Diurnal variations, however, were observed in the water of the two travertine pools downstream. In one of them, a rise in temperature (thus more CO2 degassing) during day time and consumption of CO2 due to photosynthesis of submerged aquatic plants accelerated deposition of calcite, whereas in the other pool, where aquatic plants flourished and grew out of the water (so photosynthesis was taking place in the atmosphere), the authors suggest that temperature-dependent root respiration underwater took place, which dominated until noon. Consequently, due to the release of CO2 by the root respiration into water, which dominated CO2 production by degassing induced by temperature increase, the increased dissolution of calcite was observed. This is the first time anywhere at least in China that the effect of root respiration on diurnal hydrochemical variations has been observed. The finding has implications for sampling strategy within travertine-depositing streams and other similar environments with stagnant water bodies such as estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, pools and wetlands, where aquatic plants may flourish and grow out of water.					wang, jinliang/GRJ-3717-2022; Liu, Zaihua/K-2869-2013; Li, Qiang/AAF-7841-2021	Liu, Zaihua/0000-0002-6211-7357; Li, Qiang/0000-0003-1265-8435													1380-6165	1573-1421				APR	2006	12	2					103	121		10.1007/s10498-005-2962-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-005-2962-2													WOS:000237500000001

Together with earlier work from the same region this yields a nearly complete record from the time of deglaciation to the present. Isolation and/or transgression sequences in one lake and five tidal basins have been identified using lithostratigraphic analyses, sedimentary characteristics, magnetic susceptibility, saturated induced remanent magnetisation (SIRM), organic and carbonate content, and macrofossil analyses. AMS radiocarbon dating of macrofossils and bulk sediment samples provides the timescale. Relative sea level fell rapidly and reached present-day level at similar to 9300 cal.yr BP and continued falling until at least 9000 cal.yr BP. Between 8000and6000cal.yrBPsea level reached its lowest level of around similar to 10m below highest astronomical tide. At around 5000 cal. yr BP, sea level had reached above 7.8 m below highest astronomical tide and slowly continued to rise, not reaching present-day sea level until today. The isostatic rebound caused rapid isolation of the basins that are seen as distinct isolation contacts in the sediments. In contrast, the late Holocene transgressions are less well defined and occurred over longer time intervals. The late Holocene sea-level rise may be a consequence of isostatic reloading by advancing glaciers and/or an effect of the delayed response to isostatic rebound of the Laurentide ice sheet. One consequence of this transgression is that settlements of Palaeo-Eskimo Cultures may be missing in Southern Greenland. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We performed a mesocosm experiment to investigate the structuring and cascading effects of two predominant crustacean mesozooplankton groups on microbial food web components. The natural summer plankton community of a mesotrophic lake was exposed to density gradients of Daphnia and copepods. Regression analysis was used to reveal top-down impacts of mesozooplankton on protists and bacteria after days 9 and 15. 2. Selective grazing by copepods caused a clear trophic cascade via ciliates to nanoplankton. Medium-sized (20-40 mum) ciliates (mainly Oligotrichida) were particularly negatively affected by copepods whereas nanociliates (mainly Prostomatida) became more abundant. Phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoflagellates increased significantly with increasing copepod biomass, which we interpret as an indirect response to reduced grazing pressure from the medium-sized ciliates. 3. In Daphnia-treatments, ciliates of all size classes as well as nanoflagellates were reduced directly but the overall predation effect became most strongly visible after 15 days at higher Daphnia biomass. 4. The response of bacterioplankton involved only modest changes in bacterial biomass and cell-size distribution along the zooplankton gradients. Increasing zooplankton biomass resulted either in a reduction (with Daphnia) or in an increase (with copepods) of bacterial biovolume, activity and production. Patterns of bacterial diversity, as measured by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), showed no distinct grouping after 9 days, whereas a clear treatment-coupled similarity clustering occurred after 15 days. 5. The experiment demonstrated that zooplankton-mediated predatory interactions cascade down to the bacterial level, but also revealed that changes occurred rather slowly in this summer plankton community and were most pronounced with respect to bacterial activity and composition.					; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013	Jurgens, Klaus/0000-0002-7999-9368; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2003	48	12					2174	2193		10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01158.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01158.x													WOS:000186697000009
J	Roy, I; Gandhi, N				Roy, Ipsita; Gandhi, Naveen			Trace element variations in Indian speleothems: Insights into the Holocene climate	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Speleothems from the Gupteswar and Kadapa caves were investigated using trace element (TE) ratios (Mg, Ba, Sr, Rb, Mn, Ti, U) over the last 7000 years, supported by Th-230/U-234 dating, to understand the regional and local climate variability induced by the Indian Summer Monsoon. The behavior of TE in calcite is influenced by temperature, seepage pathways, bedrock chemistry, and vegetation cover above the cave. A continuous decrease in the Ba/Sr ratio since 7 ka BP indicates changes in regional precipitation or local moisture availability during this period. However, determining changes in drip water rate and chemical composition is challenging due to the lack of supporting data. Variations in the TE ratios suggest significant climate and depositional changes at similar to 4.2 ka BP and similar to 2.8 ka BP. A decline in precipitation was observed between 4.2 and 3.8 ka BP and at similar to 2.8 ka BP, with an increase in aeolian deposition at the study site since 3.8 ka BP because of preceding dry conditions. The moist and dry climate phases deduced from stable isotope values corroborate the variations in trace element ratios, affirming the paleoclimatic significance of the studied trace elements in tropical cave deposits. A probable explanation for the decline in precipitation at the study location around 4.2 ka BP is the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) along with a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. The prevailing dry conditions in this region could have impacted the northward monsoonal winds, contributing to the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. Another abrupt change observed at similar to 2.8 ka BP can be linked to low solar activity and the southward movement of the ITCZ, coupled with enhanced El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation activity.						gandhi, naveen/0000-0003-0266-0398													1040-6182	1873-4553				NOV 1	2024	709						55	65		10.1016/j.quaint.2024.08.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.08.007		NOV 2024											WOS:001355468800001

Several studies have showed that the surface of plastic debris can be colonized by microbes, leading to the sinking of floating plastic debris in marine environment. In this work, development of biofilm on polypropylene sheet (squares with a side length of 5 and 10 mm) and their buoyancy changes were studied in a freshwater lake in four seasons. Results showed that biofilm development have different growth rate and distinct algae composition in different seasons, which are mainly related to the difference in temperature, nutrient levels, and suspend solids in lake water. Biofilm development was much quicker on small plastics in all seasons. At the end of the experiment, all plastics lost buoyancy in summer while only a small portion lost buoyance in other seasons. Sinking of the floating plastics can be attributed to the development of biofilm and the trapped minerals. Our results demonstrated that biofilm development can cause the sinking of floating plastics in fresh lakes but the time required to lose buoyance can differ seasonally. Floating plastics will remain in water for a longer time in cold season but sink in a short time in warm season. Future research is required to determine the influence of plastic types and shapes, and quantitative relation between environmental variables and the sinking behavior of the fouled plastics should be established for a better prediction of their fate in the freshwater environment.

Experimental thermocline deepening alters vertical distribution and community structure of phytoplankton in a 4-year whole-reservoir manipulation	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater phytoplankton communities are currently experiencing multiple global change stressors, including increasing frequency and intensity of storms. An important mechanism by which storms affect lake and reservoir phytoplankton is by altering the water column's thermal structure (e.g., changes to thermocline depth). However, little is known about the effects of intermittent thermocline deepening on phytoplankton community vertical distribution and composition or the consistency of phytoplankton responses to varying frequency of these disturbances over multiple years. We conducted whole-ecosystem thermocline deepening manipulations in a small reservoir. We used an epilimnetic mixing system to experimentally deepen the thermocline via five short (24-72 hr) mixing events across two summers, inducing potential responses to storms. For comparison, we did not manipulate thermocline depth in two succeeding summers. We collected weekly depth profiles of water temperature, light, nutrients, and phytoplankton biomass as well as bottle samples to assess phytoplankton community composition. We then used time-series analysis and multivariate ordination to assess the effects of intermittent thermocline deepening due to both our experimental manipulations and naturally occurring storms on phytoplankton community structure. We observed inter-annual and intra-annual variability in phytoplankton community response to thermocline deepening. We found that peak phytoplankton biomass was significantly deeper in years with a higher frequency of thermocline deepening events (i.e., years with both manipulations and natural storms) due to altered thermal stratification and more variable depth distributions of soluble reactive phosphorus. Furthermore, we found that the depth of peak phytoplankton biomass was linked to phytoplankton community composition, with certain taxa being associated with deep or shallow biomass peaks, often according to functional traits such as optimal growth temperature, mixotrophy, and low-light tolerance. For example, Cryptomonas taxa, which are low-light tolerant and mixotrophic, were associated with deep peaks, while the cyanobacterial taxon Dolichospermum was associated with shallow peaks. Our results demonstrate that abrupt thermocline deepening due to water column mixing affects both phytoplankton depth distribution and community structure via alteration of physical and chemical gradients. In addition, our work supports previous research that phytoplankton depth distributions are related to phytoplankton community composition at inter-annual and intra-annual timescales. Variability in the inter-annual and intra-annual responses of phytoplankton to abrupt thermocline deepening indicates that antecedent conditions and the seasonal timing of surface water mixing may mediate these responses. Our findings emphasise that phytoplankton depth distributions are sensitive to global change stressors and effects on depth distributions should be taken into account when predicting phytoplankton responses to increased storms under global change.

Diel horizontal and vertical distribution of cladoceran assemblages was studied in two deep lakes (Milada and Most Lakes, Czech Republic) in early (June) and late (September) summer. The objectivewas to study diel verticalmigration (DVM) and diel horizontal migration (DHM) of cladocerans under conditions of different macrophyte cover in littoral areas (rich in Milada Lake, poor in Most Lake) and fish assemblages (non-specialised planktivorous species in Milada Lake, and abundant planktivorous fish - maraena whitefish, Coregonus maraena - in open water habitats in Most Lake). Temporal variations in cladoceran assemblages were reported in both lakes in the two sampling periods. DVMwas observed in the two lakes, performed by themost vulnerable species to fish predation (the larger Daphnia spp.), but with different patterns (direct and reverse) probably linked with the local fish community and other biotic and abiotic factors in each lake. Horizontal movements were only observed in Most Lake: D. longispina increase its abundance in open waters at night compared to the littoral points; while Ceriodaphnia spp. showed the inverse pattern. In both lakes, higher densities were often found at night in surface layers, producing a great "diurnal deficit": cladocerans remain undetected in some zones during the day (especially in the littoral areas) moving to surface layers at night.

How these two systems interacted along their transition zone in the northern Tibetan Plateau remains unclear, especially over centennially to millennial timescales. This study investigates moisture evolution along the EASM-Westerlies transition zone using 10 Late Holocene paleolake shorelines from Toson Lake in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Shorelines are dated using a newly developed single-grain post infrared-infrared stimulated luminescence (pIR(50)IR(170)) dating protocol for 14,500 K-feldspar grains and used to reconstruct the evolution of Toson Lake over the past millennium. Results show that Toson Lake was stable during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), expanded during the Little Ice Age (LIA) with a distinct highstand from AD1600-1700 punctuated by short-duration low period at similar to CE 1650. After which, Toson Lake dramatically contracted into the Current Warm period (CWP). Lake level changes are consistent with Westerlies precipitation variability across Central Asia, in contrast to records from the EASM dominated northeastern Tibetan Plateau and northern China documenting an arid LIA and wet MWP. Reanalysis of modern climatic data are combined with our lake chronology to reveal that although EASM strength influences precipitation variability across northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) and northern China, EASM precipitation has not directly penetrated deep inland over the past millennium. Instead, Westerlies moisture, modulated by the see-saw of the North Atlantic Oscillation, together with the moisture controlled by the anticyclonic circulation over Mongolia and negatively related to the EASM strength, dominated water vapour transport to the midlatitudes of Central Asia. Out-of-phase moisture transport and interaction between the Westerlies and EASM drives asynchronous lake evolution between Central and East Asia over centennial-millennial timescales.

They are widely distributed in various habitats including freshwater, brackish water, soil and moss. They play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles and energy flow of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They can provide a good record or proxy of past environmental change due to their environmental sensitivity and high diversity. Recent research on these microorganisms suggests they have been increasingly used as a biotic proxy of environmental and climatic reconstruction, water quality and pollution. Many testate amoeba species have a cosmopolitan distribution at least at the morphological level, but others have restricted geographical distribution. In China, we found there are abundant and diverse testate amoebae in reservoirs and lakes, including some endemic species. In recent years, however, the local species diversity of testate amoebae has been decreasing due to rapid increases in the level of reservoir or lake eutrophication. Currently, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has become an important topic, so it is necessary and urgent to conduct systematic ecology research for endemic testate amoeba population in China. Netzelia tuberspinifera (basionym Difflugia tuberspinifera) is an endemic sensitive species of East Asia and is widely distributed in southern China. We found that the distribution of N. tuberspinifera was significantly related to latitude, elevation and temperature based on the datasets of 88 lakes and reservoirs in China, and this microorganism was mainly distributed in subtropical and tropical lakes and reservoirs characterized by low latitude, low elevation and high water temperature. Our study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of N. tuberspinifera based on a high-frequency time series, sampled over four years from Tingxi Reservoir (Xiamen, China) combined with spatial samples from 28 reservoirs in 14 watersheds in southern China, and to reveal the ecological factors and processes that shape its distributions. The results showed that water temperature and foods (phytoplankton) exhibited significant effects on seasonal patterns of N. tuberspinifera population density (0-10.7 ind/L), with a higher correlation coefficient for water temperature than for food. In the Tingxi Reservoir, surface water temperature ranged from 14.3 to 32.1 degrees C over four years from 2016 to 2019. When water temperature was above 30 degrees C, N. tuberspinifera displayed better growth and reproduction, so its population density was higher in summer and autumn than in other seasons. On the spatial scale, the population density of N. tuberspinifera was 0-19.2 ind/L, which was mainly limited by geographical factors and decreased with an increase in latitude and longitude, respectively. Meanwhile, foods (phytoplankton), electrical conductivity and nitrate nitrogen also had significant effects on N. tuberspinifera population density. Interestingly, the variation in aperture diameter (33.5-68.2 mu m in Tingxi Reservoir; 33.5-73.6 mu m in 11 watersheds) of N. tuberspinifera was the major contributing factor in explaining the temporal-spatial differences of population morphological characteristics. Furthermore, we found that foods (phytoplankton) play a key role in the difference of aperture diameter between different seasons in Tingxi Reservoir. The difference in aperture diameter between the Yangtze River and other watersheds was mainly affected by foods (phytoplankton), total carbon and water turbidity. Based on the spatial-temporal difference of the N. tuberspinifera metapopulation, our work improves the understanding of geographical distribution and diversity of testate amoebae, and provides important references for ecological evaluation and biodiversity conservation in subtropical and tropical reservoirs.					chen, huihuang/AAB-8350-2019; Yang, Jun/E-6680-2011; YANG, Jun/E-6680-2011; ren, kexin/AAV-6153-2020	YANG, Jun/0000-0002-7920-2777; 													0023-074X	2095-9419					2022	67	1					85	98		10.1360/TB-2021-0587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2021-0587													WOS:000747487400013

Environmental parameters that were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) correlated with CPUE varied among reservoirs. In Lake Oahe, age-0 abundance was higher in years with high flushing, low discharge from its upstream dam, and warmer air temperature during June and July. In Lake Sharpe, age-0 abundance was higher in years with cooler air temperature during January, April, and May, and less discharge and lower inflow during July. In Lake Francis Case, age-0 abundance was higher in years with higher spring precipitation, evaporation and temperature, and in years with greater decline in elevation from May to July. In Lewis and Clark Lake, age-0 abundance was higher in years with high spring and annual inflow, high reservoir elevation in March and elevation increase from April to May, and increased annual storage. Multiple regression models were developed for each of the four reservoirs with age-0 white bass CPUE as the dependent variable; coefficients of determination ranged from 0.90 to 0.94. Although the relations we observed were correlations and not necessarily cause and effect, the results of this study provide insights into white bass biology in the Missouri River reservoirs.

This tropical diatom is a representative of the rather small genus Afrocymbella with only 12 known species and with a distribution restricted to the African Rift. Taxa belonging to this genus are heteropolar and characterized by dorsiventral valves curved along the pervalvar axis and the presence of small pseudosepta and septa on the open girdle bands. Afrocymbella barkeri was common only towards the end of the dry and windy season corresponding to northern hemisphere summer, when deep water-column mixing caused upwelling of nutrient-rich water from the hypolimnion. This taxon was observed free living in the water column during mixing, but the presence of a small apical pore field at the foot pole, along with some cells with mucilage stalks, suggests that its primary habitat probably involves attachment to a substrate.

Reanalysis-driven climate simulation over CORDEX North America domain using the Canadian Regional Climate Model, version 5: model performance evaluation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The performance of reanalysis-driven Canadian Regional Climate Model, version 5 (CRCM5) in reproducing the present climate over the North American COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment domain for the 1989-2008 period has been assessed in comparison with several observation-based datasets. The model reproduces satisfactorily the near-surface temperature and precipitation characteristics over most part of North America. Coastal and mountainous zones remain problematic: a cold bias (2-6 A degrees C) prevails over Rocky Mountains in summertime and all year-round over Mexico; winter precipitation in mountainous coastal regions is overestimated. The precipitation patterns related to the North American Monsoon are well reproduced, except on its northern limit. The spatial and temporal structure of the Great Plains Low-Level Jet is well reproduced by the model; however, the night-time precipitation maximum in the jet area is underestimated. The performance of CRCM5 was assessed against earlier CRCM versions and other RCMs. CRCM5 is shown to have been substantially improved compared to CRCM3 and CRCM4 in terms of seasonal mean statistics, and to be comparable to other modern RCMs.					Separovic, Leo/MSY-9545-2025														0930-7575	1432-0894				DEC	2013	41	11-12					2973	3005		10.1007/s00382-013-1778-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1778-9													WOS:000327080400011

The temporal and spatial variation characteristics of grain-size were investigated in six sediment cores of the plateau deep-lake Fuxian, in southwest China, where the climate was driven by Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Results indicated that the size of the dominant grain-size exponentially decreased with the declining hydrodynamic condition towards the deep-water zones, with an exception of the maximum grain-size near the outlet of the lake. Measured grain-size distributions were classified into four end-members (EMs) with a basic end-member model algorithm (BasEMMA), of which could be linked to a distinct transport mechanism and source: EM1 (long-term suspended load from atmospheric dust) with the modal size of 0.3-11.2 & mu;m, EM2 (off-shore suspended load from fine riverine input) with 7.9-14.2 & mu;m, EM3 ((near-shore suspended load from coarse riverine input) with 15.9-31.7 & mu;m, and EM4 (near-shore riverbed load from extremely coarse riverine input) with 35.6-70.9 & mu;m, respectively. Temporal variation of EM2 + EM3 components of grain-size in Core F5 are responses to the changes in instrumentally recorded precipitation in Chengjiang (1961-2008) and ISM (1860-2006), which indicates that changes in river flow in response to changes in precipitation is the primary driver of clastic sediment deposition especially in the narrow section of the lake. Our findings indicate grain-size distribution and sediment compositions are significant tools for improving the understanding of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in dry-humid transformation of ISM over the past 150 years.

J	Smith, MA				Smith, M. A.			Late Quaternary landscapes in Central Australia: sedimentary history and palaeoecology of Puritjarra rock shelter	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Puritjarra rock shelter provides a long record of late Quaternary vegetation in the Australian arid zone. Analysis of the sedimentary history of this rock shelter is combined with reanalysis of charcoal and phytolith records to provide a first-order picture of changing landscapes in western Central Australia. These show a landscape responding to increasing aridity from 45 ka with deflation of clay-rich red palaeosols (<45 ka) and sharp declines in grassland arid other vegetation at 40-36 ka, and at the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (24 ka). Vegetation in the catchment of the rock shelter recovered after 15 ka with expansion of both acacia woodland and spinifex grasslands, registering stronger summer rainfall in the interior of the continent. By 8.3 ka re-vegetation of local palaeosols and duties had choked off sediment Supply to the rock shelter and the character of the sediments changed abruptly. Poaceae Values peaked at 5.8 ka, Suggesting the early-mid Holocene climatic optimum in Central Australia is bracketed between 8.3 and 5.8 ka. Local vegetation was disrupted in the late Holocene with a sharp decline in Poaceae at 3.8 ka, coinciding with an abrupt intensification of ENSO. Local grasslands recovered over the next two millennia and by 1.5 ka the modern vegetation appears to have become established. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Predator telemetry informs temporal and spatial overlap with stocked salmonids in Lake Huron	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												Double-Crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auratus), Walleyes (Sander vitreus), and Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are migratory predators that undergo extensive movements in Lake Huron. Stocking of juvenile salmonid fish (Oncorhynchus and Salmo sp.) is an important component of fishery management in Lake Huron and assessing the spatial and temporal extent of predator movements is a useful consideration for determining when and where to stock juvenile fish to reduce predation and maximize survival. Previous investigation indicated that some Walleyes migrate to the main basin of Lake Huron in spring from Saginaw Bay. Similarly, telemetry studies of Lake Trout movement in Lake Huron have indicated an onshore movement in the spring. We used detection histories of Walleyes implanted with acoustic transmitters tagged in Saginaw Bay and Lake Trout implanted in northern Lake Huron to estimate the arrival date of migrating adults at eight ports in Lake Huron, where hatchery reared juvenile salmonids are stocked. Satellite telemetry of Cormorants that return to nesting grounds in northern Lake Huron were used to estimate their arrival dates at the same Lake Huron ports. Arrival of Walleye at Lake Huron ports ranged from April 10th to May 7th. Cormorants arrived earlier than Walleye at most Lake Huron ports (April 11th-April 18th). Lake Trout were more variable with a range of onshore movement from March 28th to May 16th. Our results suggested stocking efforts at these ports should generally occur before April 14th to decrease predatory impact from Cormorants, Walleyes, and Lake Trout.

Large-scale patterns in summer diffusive CH4 fluxes across boreal lakes, and contribution to diffusive C emissions	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Lakes are a major component of boreal landscapes, and whereas lake CO2 emissions are recognized as a major component of regional C budgets, there is still much uncertainty associated to lake CH4 fluxes. Here, we present a large-scale study of the magnitude and regulation of boreal lake summer diffusive CH4 fluxes, and their contribution to total lake carbon (C) emissions, based on in situ measurements of concentration and fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in 224 lakes across a wide range of lake type and environmental gradients in Quebec. The diffusive CH4 flux was highly variable (mean 11.6 +/- 26.4 SD mgm(-2)d(-1)), and it was positively correlated with temperature and lake nutrient status, and negatively correlated with lake area and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The relationship between CH4 and CO2 concentrations fluxes was weak, suggesting major differences in their respective sources and/or regulation. For example, increasing water temperature leads to higher CH4 flux but does not significantly affect CO2 flux, whereas increasing CDOM concentration leads to higher CO2 flux but lower CH4 flux. CH4 contributed to 8 +/- 23% to the total lake C emissions (CH4+CO2), but 18 +/- 25% to the total flux in terms of atmospheric warming potential, expressed as CO2-equivalents. The incorporation of ebullition and plant-mediated CH4 fluxes would further increase the importance of lake CH4. The average Q(10) of CH4 flux was 3.7, once other covarying factors were accounted for, but this apparent Q(10) varied with lake morphometry and was higher for shallow lakes. We conclude that global climate change and the resulting shifts in temperature will strongly influence lake CH4 fluxes across the boreal biome, but these climate effects may be altered by regional patterns in lake morphometry, nutrient status, and browning.					; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Rasilo, Terhi/Q-8248-2016	Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Rasilo, Terhi/0000-0002-3502-4040; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2015	21	3					1124	1139		10.1111/gcb.12741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12741								25220765					WOS:000349896400011
J	Vainola, R; Vainio, JK				Vainola, R; Vainio, JK			Distributions, life cycles and hybridization of two Mysis relicta group species (Crustacea: Mysida) in the northern Baltic Sea and Lake Baven	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We used electrophoretically identified material to assess the geographical distributions, life cycles and interspecific hybridization of two sibling species of the Mysis relicta species group (sp. I and sp. II) in the northern Baltic region. In the Gulf of Finland, sp. I prevails in inshore waters and sp. II in the open sea; the distributions overlap in the outer archipelago zone. In the Gulf of Bothnia, only sp. II was found in the southern part (Bothnian Sea), whereas the two species coexist throughout the northerly Bothnian Bay. Both the local and large-scale distributions are salinity-related, but salinity alone does not explain the differences. The two species exhibit different patterns of geographical variation in their life histories. In strict sympatry in the north they have identical two-year life cycles with winter breeding. Further south (Gulf of Finland), sp. I exhibits a predominantly one-year winter-breeding cycle, whereas sp. II breeds throughout the year. The patterns comply with the concept of a great phenotypic flexibility and environmental control of life history characteristics in the Mysis relicta group, and make a contrast to the stable life cycle of the congeneric M. mixta. F1 hybrids between the two M. relicta group species were found at a low frequency (0.6%) in the Bothnian Bay, but not in other areas of sympatry.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	368						137	148		10.1023/A:1003237829779	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003237829779													WOS:000076259700015
J	Odland, A				Odland, Arvid			A long-term study of Carex vesicaria and Phalaris arundinacea population dynamics in permanent plots	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												It is well known that the population structure of plants in permanent plots change from year to year. Species abundances probably shift with time due to both species biology and variation in environmental factors. The main purpose of the study has been to describe and analyse long-term variation in the abundance (coverage) of blister sedge Carex vesicaria and reed canary grass Phalaris arundinacea in relation to time and space after a permanent lowering of a lake water level and exposition of new areas for species colonization. The study area lies in outer edge of a freshwater fluvial delta in the northern part of the Myrkdalen lake (229 m a.s.l.) West Norway, which was exposed after a permanent 1.4 m lowering of the summer water level in 1987. A 40 m long transect with ten 0.5 m x 4 m plot was established on the lower parts of the exposed delta in 1987. Study plots were situated at mean heights between 13 and 92 cm above the new summer water level. Floristic composition of the plots was monitored and analysed from 1988 to 2020, a total of 19 times. The plants show major differences in establishment, growth, and long-time dynamics in the permanent plots. The coverage of C. vesicaria and P. arundinacea was highly variable over the study period. Variations in coverage were related to time using regression analyses. The trends were mostly best described by cubic functions. Both species showed relatively low coverages between 18 and 26 years after the lake water drawdown, but increased again over the last study periods. Maximum coverage of the species was in time gradually separated by elevation. C. vesicaria became dominant in plots less than ca. 50 cm above the mean summer water, and P. arundinacea reached higher coverage above that elevation. The study indicates that elevation, as a proxy for flooding duration, and not aboveground species competition was the main factor for this difference in distribution.																			1505-2249					DEC	2023	71	2-3					49	57		10.3161/15052249PJE2023.71.2.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2023.71.2.001													WOS:001170467200001

A record of climate over the last millennium based on varved lake sediments from the Canadian High Arctic	HOLOCENE												A varved sediment record that extends back over the last millennium was recovered from Lower Murray Lake, northern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada (81 degrees 20'N, 69 degrees 30'W). Flatbed scan images and backscattered electron images were analysed to provide varve thickness and other quantitative sedimentary indices on an annual basis. In many studies of lakes from the High Arctic, varve thickness is a good proxy for summer temperature and we interpret the Lower Murray Lake varves in this way. On that basis, the Lower Murray Lake varve thickness record suggests that summer temperatures in recent decades were among the warmest of the last millennium, comparable with conditions that last occurred in the early twelfth and late thirteenth centuries, but estimates based on the sediment accumulation rate do not show such a recent increase. The coldest conditions of the 'Little Ice Age' were experienced from similar to AD 1700 to the mid-nineteenth century, when extensive ice cover on the lake led to widespread anoxic conditions in the deepest parts of the lake basin. An overall decline in median grain size over the last 1000 years indicates a reduction in the energy available to transport sediment to the lake. Many of these features of the record are also observed in other palaeoclimatic records from the North American Arctic. The very recent appearance of the diatom Campylodiscus, which was not observed throughout the record of the last millennium, suggests that a new threshold in the ontogenetic development of the lake has now been passed.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Stoner, Joseph Stephen/0000-0002-4848-5452; Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2008	18	1					169	180		10.1177/0959683607085607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607085607													WOS:000254220200014

J	von Rohden, C; Boehrer, B; Ilmberger, J				von Rohden, C.; Boehrer, B.; Ilmberger, J.			Evidence for double diffusion in temperate meromictic lakes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												We present CTD-measurements from two shallow meromictic mining lakes. The lakes, which differ in size and depth, show completely different seasonal mixing patterns in their mixolimnia. However, the measurements document the occurrence of similar seasonal convective mixing in discrete layers within their monimolimnia. This mixing is induced by double diffusion and can be identified by the characteristic step-like structure of the temperature and electrical conductivity profiles. The steps develop in the upper part of the monimolimnion, when in autumn cooling mixolimnion temperatures have dropped below temperatures of the underlying monimolimnion. The density gradient across the chemocline due to solutes overcompensates the destabilizing temperature gradient, and moreover, keeps the vertical transport close to molecular level. In conclusion, preconditions for double diffusive effects are given on a seasonal basis. At in general high local stabilities N-2 in the monimolimnia of 10(-4)-10(-2)s(-2), the stability ratio R was in the range of 1-20. This quantitatively indicates that double diffusion can become visible. Between 1 and 6 sequent steps, with sizes between 1 dm and 1 m, were visually identified in the CTD-profiles. In the lower monimolimnion of the deeper lake, the steps systematically emerge at a time delay of more than half a year, which matches with the progression of the mixolimnetic temperature changes into the monimolimnion. In none of the lakes, the chemocline interface is degraded by these processes. However, double diffusive convection is essential for the redistribution of solutes in the inner parts of the monimolimnion at longer time scales, which is crucial for the assessment of the ecologic development of such lakes.

Sediment showed drastic increases in fine fraction (silt and clay) after the dyke construction. TN, TP, and OC contents in the sediment showed the similar spatial variation to that of fine fraction. A mixing model indicated benthic fluxes of nutrients such as PO4, NH4, and SiO2, which were considerably elevated during the summer monsoon season. It is revealed that this phenomenon was associated with the development of strong salinity stratification, elevated water temperature, and increased groundwater discharge. However, a change in the sedimentation environment due to dyke construction is suggested as the primary reason for the enhanced benthic fluxes.					; Kim, Hyeong-U/AAV-2668-2021	Kim, Kangjoo/0000-0002-3642-1486; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2009	32	6					1165	1175		10.1007/s12237-009-9217-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-009-9217-1													WOS:000271398600012

Catch statistics specifically report "Edelfisch" until 1978. Because of dwindling catches, "Edelfisch" were not reported as such but were included in the collective "large-type whitefish" catches after 1978. The species was considered extinct as of 1980. The likely reason for the assumed extinction was lake eutrophication, with oxygen depletion at the depth of 100-200 m where the "Edelfisch" used to spawn. From 1995 on, "Edelfisch" started to appear again in commercial catches, though very rarely. In summer 2004, test fishing with gillnets targeting the "Edelfisch" on its traditional spawning grounds yielded 27 fish, all mature and ripe or close to spawning. Eggs from the only female with running eggs were stripped and fertilised, and incubated at 8.3 and 4.2 degrees C. Stages and duration of embryonic development at both temperatures are reported for the first time. Larvae from the 8.3 degrees C batch were reared on dry food in an aquarium. Mortality during the first 50 days was 73%, and only 10% survived eight months. The presently favourable lake conditions, in combination with gradually decreasing fishing intensity, will allow the "Edelfisch" population to eventually expand further on its own.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						419	430																WOS:000249090200035

In between the two cruises, a big flood event occurred in July, 2010. Elemental, stable C, N isotope, radiocarbon isotope (Delta C-14), black carbon (BC) analysis, and chemical biomarkers were utilized to study the effect of the sources, short-term events and physical processes on the composition, abundance, and age of the surface sedimentary OC in this dynamic system. Bulk N/C ratio of 0.10 to 0.14 and delta C-13 of -23.1%. to -20.9% in these samples indicated a mixture source of terrestrial, deltaic and marine derived OC during both cruises. The TOC was 1,980 to 5,040 yr old based on Delta C-14, and BC extracted from two 2009 sediment samples was older: 5,480 and 5,920 yr old. While the Changjiang River was a main source of the terrestrial derived OC, refractory BC and reworked marine organic matter seemed to comprise the older, less reactive carbon pool in the surface sediments of the ECS. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that more than 50% of the TOC was derived from the marine end-member, followed by the deltaic OC. The chlorophyll a of the 2010 sediment samples (11.06 +/- 10.15 nmol g(-1), OC, n=7) was significantly lower than that of the 2009 samples (34.58 +/- 20.29 nmol g(-1) OC, n=7). However, zeaxanthin, a biomarker for cyanobacteria, had significantly higher concentration in the 2010 sediment samples (9.26 +/- 3.48 nmol g(-1) OC, n=7) than that of the 2009 samples (5.50 +/- 4.62 nmol g(-1) OC, n=7). The lack of benthic-pelagic coupling of pigment concentrations in surface sediments after the flood of 2010 was likely due to lateral transport of surface sediments to and from this region. While there were no significant linkages between in situ shelf-derived phytoplankton sources of OC and surface sediment pigment concentrations in 2010, other algal inputs from local deltaic lakes may have contributed to the compositional changes in concentration of sediment carotenoids. The flood of summer 2010 likely played a critical role in the observed shift of the locations for the highest terrestrial biomarker concentrations in sediments. Little evidence remained from the 2010 flood event, which suggested that winter wind/wave energy and hydrodynamic sorting had a substantial effect on sediment OC redistribution.

Urban lakes wetlands can promote this deposition through their effects on the microclimate. To document these effects we investigated air PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in transects around by monitoring PM and land use of 16 urban lake wetlands in the spring in Wuhan. The results showed that (1) lake wetland land-use regression models for air PM10,2.5 were successfully developed with an adjusted R-(PM10)(2) (0.365-0.982) and adjusted R-(PM2.5)(2) (0.483-0.969). Based on the lake wetland land use regression (LW LUR) model, the traffic variable was determined to be the strongest predictor of PM10,2.5, followed by distance to the city centre and relative humidity for PM10 and open green space and distance to the city centre for PM2.5. (2) The landscape descriptors of the lake wetland (less than 0.2 km(2) lake area) significantly affected PM10,2.5 in the central areas of the city, and air PM10,2.5 concentration was negatively correlated with wetland area (WA), landscape shape index (LSI), and proportion of non-built up area in the 500-m buffer zone surrounding the lake wetland (PB). (3) The lake wetlands showed decreasing air PM10,2.5 concentration, and the maximum air PM10,2.5 concentration gap between the wetlands and their surroundings occurred at 12:00-14:00 am and was from 10 to 50 mu g/m(3) for PM10 and from 5 to 15 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5. Effective understanding of these PM10,2.5 effects can contribute to better planning of urban development when considering the rising concerns of global air pollution and continued rapid urbanization.																			1618-8667					APR	2018	31						142	156		10.1016/j.ufug.2018.02.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.02.008													WOS:000430594600014

We focus on the Peloponnese peninsula, SW Greece, characterized by a W-E rainfall/temperature gradient and a strong climate-sensitivity to shifts in the large-scale atmospheric patterns. A radiocarbon-dated sediment core, taken from the ancient Lake Lema, a former lake in NE Peloponnese, was analyzed for distribution and hydrogen isotope (delta D) composition of n-alkanes and bulk organic geochemistry (delta C-13, TOC). The predominantly macrophyte (submerged/floating)-derived delta D-23 profile exhibits the largest long-term fluctuation in the record and co-varies with delta D of long-chain n-alkanes providing evidence for precipitation and temperature changes over the last 5000 years. The Lerna delta D-23 signal is sometimes in agreement with other n-alkane delta D records from SW Peloponnese indicating wetter conditions in the peninsula at ca 5000-4600, ca 4500-4100, ca 3000-2600 (more unstable in SW) and after ca 700 cal BP with drier periods at ca 4100-3900 and ca 1000-700 cal BP. Conversely, a NE-SW climate see-saw is revealed at ca 4600-4500, ca 3200, ca 2600-1800, and ca 1200-1000 cal BP when the delta D-23 Lerna exhibits more positive trends (drier in NE) with a reversal at ca 3900-3300, ca 3200-3000 and ca 1800-1300 cal BP. These opposing and sometimes similar signals between NE and SW Peloponnese can be explained by the relative dominance of high-latitude atmospheric patterns over the peninsula. A similar signal would be expected when the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) exerts the main control with NAO (+) creating conditions of reduced moisture. The dipole pattern is likely driven by shifts in North Sea-Caspian Atmospheric pattern (NCP), which account for the present-day regional climate variability with NCP (+) leading to wetter and colder conditions in NE Peloponnese. The Asian monsoonal system likely has an additional impact on the delta D variabilities through influencing the summer temperatures. There is a consistency between the Peloponnesian delta D signals and monsoonal records after ca 4000 cal BP confirming the actualistic models. Strong monsoonal periods coincide with cooler summers (lower delta D values) in Lerna, due to the northerly winds, the Etesians. On the contrary, SW Peloponnese is dominated by warmer conditions during the same periods as the area is located on the lee side of the mountain and highly influenced by the adiabatic warming associated with the subsidence over the Eastern Mediterranean.

The chronology is based on eight radiocarbon dates in addition to two dated tephra horizons. The sediment contains eight cryptotephra layers attributable to Baitoushan, a volcano on the Korea/China border. Pollen, diatom and botanical macrofossil analyses indicate climate fluctuations during the Holocene and a compositional response of biodiverse mountain forests to changes in temperature and humidity. Widespread, diverse broadleaf-dominated forest marked a warm Early Holocene (similar to 9500-9280 cal. a BP). Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) rose to dominance in the Middle Holocene (after c. 7630 cal. a BP). Evergreen conifers, fir (Abies) in particular, became widespread after 2.9 ka BP and show a positive response to the Little Ice Age cooling. Over the c. 10 000-year record, moisture appears largely controlled by gradually declining intensity of the summer monsoon, trending from moist conditions in the Early Holocene to cooler and drier conditions in the Late Holocene with shorter-term hydrological changes superimposed. Peat composition indicates significant changes in mire vegetation, and diatom assemblages indicate four stages of inundation and three dry stages in the basin, probably controlled by precipitation changes. The initial importance of atmospheric precipitation shifted over time to a greater input from groundwater. During a long episode in the Late Holocene the basin may have dried out. Forest fires occurred during much of the Middle and Late Holocene, and their prominence, as marked by macro-charcoal, is related to changes in humidity. Human activities mark the past few centuries.

J	Blanchard, D; Aherne, J				Blanchard, Dane; Aherne, Julian			Spatiotemporal variation in summer ground-level ozone in the Sandbanks Provincial Park, Ontario	ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH												Ground-level ozone (O-3) is an atmospheric pollutant of concern owing to its impacts on both human and environmental health. In southern Ontario, Canada, air pollutants (including O-3) are continuously monitored through a network of active monitoring stations; however, these stations are largely located in urban areas. Passive samplers for O-3 and NO2 were deployed at 24 sites throughout the Sandbanks Provincial Park, on the shore of Lake Ontario during the summer of 2016 to assess the influence of lake-breeze circulation on air quality. Average O-3 measured at the park (39.4 ppb) was higher than inland sites at Belleville (32.6 ppb) and Peterborough (30.0 ppb). A negative-linear relationship (R-2 = 0.71) was observed between O-3 concentration and distance from shore (< 500 m from Lake Ontario). While a positive-linear relationship was observed between exposure wind speed and O-3 (R-2 = 0.84) when the predominant wind direction was W-SW. The results suggest that the Sandbanks was influenced by lake-breeze circulation, resulting in elevated summertime O-3. Similarly, average NO2 concentrations (4.3 ppb) were higher than the inland site at Peterborough (2.9 ppb), suggesting that lake-breeze circulation transported NO2 onshore from Lake Ontario. Elevated levels of O-3 at the Sandbanks may be a potential concern for human health; moreover, estimated three-month AOT40 suggest that O-3 may also damage vegetation.																			1309-1042					MAY	2019	10	3					931	940		10.1016/j.apr.2019.01.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2019.01.001													WOS:000466482900028

Haslea duerrenbergiana, Navicula salinarum, Nitzschia agnita, N. filiformis, Staurophora brantii, Seminavis strigosa, Tryblionella apiculata). One new genus Seminavis and 15 diatom species were noted for the first time for the diatom flora of Serbia. Dominant taxa changed over seasons without any regularity. In spring 2021, we have observed an increased abundance of centric species Thalassiosira pseudonana and Stephanodiscus part/us while in other seasons it was difficult to discern a pattern of dominance among benthic diatoms. Metabarcoding analysis of the same sample using 18S rRNA as a gene marker confirmed the dominance of centric diatoms. This study contributes to a better understanding of brackish diatom taxa found in inland habitats, many of which can be utilized as useful tools for the ecological status assessment.					; Dimkic, Ivica/GWR-2445-2022; Krizmanic, Jelena/GQZ-7822-2022; Gavrilovic, Bojan/I-1689-2012; Levkov, Zlatco/NBX-1786-2025	Krizmanic, Jelena/0000-0003-4020-7412; Dimkic, Ivica/0000-0002-0425-5938; Ciric, Milos/0000-0002-6835-3385; Levkov, Zlatko/0000-0002-1184-2356; Vidakovic, Danijela/0000-0002-8696-7743; Dojcinovic, Biljana/0000-0003-1479-8060; Gavrilovic, Bojan/0000-0001-8261-5954													2381-8107	2381-8115				JUL 3	2022	169	3					360	369		10.1080/23818107.2022.2087199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23818107.2022.2087199		JUN 2022											WOS:000812686600001

Paul; Brunk, Clifford			Natural Populations and Inbred Strains of Tetrahymena	TETRAHYMENA THERMOPHILA	Methods in Cell Biology											Tetrahymena typically is found in freshwater lakes, ponds, and streams in association with submerged or emergent vegetation. The genus consists of numerous breeding species with micronuclei and many asexual species without micronuclei. In summer months when most populations are at their peak, 30-50% of water samples may yield one or more species of Tetrahymena. This chapter describes both bulk and trapping procedures for collecting Tetrahymena and also evaluates barcode methods for species identification. The history and inbreeding of the laboratory model Tetrahymena thermophila is also discussed. There are numerous unresolved questions about Tetrahymena evolution and biogeography that may be solved by additional collecting.																			0091-679X		978-0-12-385967-9				2012	109						277	300		10.1016/B978-0-12-385967-9.00009-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-385967-9.00009-8								22444148					WOS:000303410900009
J	Cardenas, MP; Schwab, DJ; Eadie, BJ				Cardenas, MP; Schwab, DJ; Eadie, BJ			Sediment transport model validation in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A multiple sediment type, three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was applied to Lake Michigan to simulate conditions during the Spring 2000 resuspension event. Model predictions were compared to data gathered by the EEGLE project including turbidity and downward mass flux. The model predictions for turbidity compared well to observed data, especially in capturing the distinctive peaks in turbidity due to advection that occurred in the area of the resuspension feature. The advection peaks seemed tied to the presence of a highly-resuspendable pool of sediments that was transported by weaker winds during early Spring 2000. The model predictions at depths of 40 m in the area of the resuspension feature were more problematic, as the observed data in one location showed a significant turbidity peak at the time of maximum winds. The model underestimated turbidity at that particular location, yet model predictions of a very similar turbidity peak were seen at a similar depth. The different turbidity predictions at these locations were due to underestimation of offshore flow by the hydrodynamic model. The model generally underestimated downward mass flux, though the predictions for the time-intervals that included the time of peak winds and the following week were good to excellent. These intervals generally showed the highest downward mass flux. This work highlights the importance of multiple sediment types, their associated critical shear stresses for resuspension, and the presence of a very easily resuspendable sediment layer. The availability of comprehensive data set was also important.

Record-setting algal bloom in Lake Erie caused by agricultural and meteorological trends consistent with expected future conditions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.					; Steiner, Allison/AAC-7029-2020; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Daloglu, Irem/AAP-2716-2021; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018; Verhamme, Edward/KYQ-4334-2024; Steiner, Allison/F-4942-2011; Michalak, Anna/KBA-4622-2024; Posselt, Derek/I-4912-2012; Confesor, Remegio/AAZ-6237-2020; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020; kuo, kevin/GXM-4399-2022	Verhamme, Anne/0000-0002-2201-1865; Scavia, Donald/0000-0002-2784-8269; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; Steiner, Allison/0000-0002-3823-1512; Confesor, Remegio/0000-0002-7306-1432; Evans, Mary Anne/0000-0002-1627-7210; Daloglu Cetinkaya, Irem/0000-0002-9456-4610; Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; Posselt, Derek/0000-0002-5670-5822; 													0027-8424					APR 16	2013	110	16					6448	6452		10.1073/pnas.1216006110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216006110								23576718					WOS:000318041500050

Reconciliation of vegetation and climatic interpretations of pollen profiles and other regional records from the last 60 thousand years in the Savanna Biome of Southern Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Long environmental proxy records are very scarce in semi-dry continental areas and often those available present conflicting interpretations. However, more in-depth investigation of apparent contradictions, can address these problems. For example, comparison of the upper parts of pollen and sediment sequences from the Tswaing Crater and Wonderkrater spring (South Africa) and isotopes in a speleothem at Lobatse Cave (Botswana) from the Savanna Biome establishes a basis for understanding of long-term regional environmental processes in central Southern Africa over the last 60 ka. The different proxies for the vegetation can hypothetically be reconciled on condition that the chronologies on which they are based and environmental controls are firm. We discuss the ratio of woody elements, under-storey herb-cover and the vegetation's general C-4/C-3 status in the central savanna region, in relation to seasonal rainfall and temperature variations and long-term climate forcing.

In 1995 and 1996,62 and 55 charr, respectively, were captured, radio-tagged, and released back into the lake. A fixed data acquisition system recorded limited movements of radio-tagged charr in the upper reaches of the Ruggles River. the only outlet from the lake to the sea, in 1995. When movements of radio-tagged charr within Lake Hazen were monitored opportunistically in 1995, most of the relocated charr were found in warmer, more productive waters associated with inflowing streams. No movements of radio-tagged charr in the Ruggles River were recorded in 1996 when the data acquisition system was operated in the lower reaches of the river. These observations supported the conclusions of a study of Lake Hazen charr otolith strontium distribution that Lake Hazen charr were non-anadromous. The Ruggles River may be a detriment to anadromous behaviour because of its length (ca. 29 km), velocity (up to 2.25 m.s(-1)), and the year-round presence of aufeis (layered ice buildup). In summer, instead of migrating to the sea to feed, Lake Hazen charr appear to move to feed on abundant prey found in areas where inlet streams enter the lake.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2001	54	4					418	424																WOS:000173097000006
J	ANDERSEN, JM				ANDERSEN, JM			EFFECT OF NITRATE CONCENTRATION IN LAKE WATER ON PHOSPHATE RELEASE FROM THE SEDIMENT	WATER RESEARCH												Danish eutrophic lakes [31] were investigated routinely over 1 yr during 1978-1980. Nine lakes were dimictic with anoxic hypolimnia and 22 were very productive and shallow, polymictic lakes. Phosphate release from the sediment resulted in large increases in phosphate concentrations in anoxic hypolimnion, if concentrations of oxidized N in hypolimnion were less than .apprx. 0.1 g N m-3. If concentration of oxidized N (mainly nitrate) in hypolimnion was .apprx. 1 g N m-3 or higher, no release of phosphate from the sediment to anoxic hypolimnion occurred. In lakes with no summer stratification a release of phosphate from the sediment to the well oxygenated water resulted in summer maxima of phosphate in the lake water, when nitrate concentration in the water was < .apprx. 0.5 g N m-3, but no release took place if nitrate concentration exceeded .apprx. 0.5 g N m-3. This effect of oxidized N in preventing phosphate release from the sediment demonstrates the ability of oxidized N to buffer the redox potential of the surface sediment at a level high enough to prevent a release of phosphate. Among the efforts to limit phytoplankton biomass in lakes, an artificial enrichment with nitrate may in some cases be an important supplement to the usually necessary reduction in P loading, but the possibility of a stimulation of phytoplankton growth through the addition of nitrate must be carefully considered.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1982	16	7					1119	1126		10.1016/0043-1354(82)90128-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(82)90128-2													WOS:A1982NT13500007

Much of this difference is attributed to differences in management systems. This study was conducted to determine the effect of management systems on the yield and yield components of winter wheat cultivars adapted to the Great Lakes region of the USA, and to evaluate the environmental influences on the response of cultivars to different management inputs. Field studies were conducted in 1985 and 1986 near Columbus, OH, East Lansing, MI, and Madison, WI, for a total of six environments. The study consisted of nine cultivars subjected to each of six management treatments (MT) differing in seeding and N rates, the use of a fungicide, and a plant growth regulator. Care was taken to standardize procedures such that the seed of each cultivar at each location was of the same seed lot. Likewise, fungicides, herbicides, and the plant growth regulator were acquired from the same production lot and were applied identically as to rate, amount of carrier, pressure, and growth stage. Seeding rates were established as seeds per foot of row and the same N form (urea) was applied at specific growth stages, although the rate was adapted to the soil type and previous crop so that similar amounts of N would be available to the crop at each location. Prior to harvest, grain heads were collected from each plot for yield component analysis. Location, cultivar, and the interaction of the two were significant for yield and its components, while management treatments affected only yield and heads per square foot. The cultivar-by-management interaction was significant for yield and kernel weight. Location, management, cultivar, and all their interactions were significant for yield. Yield differences due to management were reflected primarily in differences in the number of heads per square foot, while yield differences due to cultivar were reflected in all three yield components. Management systems must be specific for both cultivar and environment. Yield differences will most likely be due to the number of heads per unit area, which is influenced by both seeding rate and tillering capacity of the cultivar, but the number of kernels per head and kernel size can account for large yield differences in some cultivars if suitable conditions exist.																			0890-8524					JUL-SEP	1989	2	3					257	261		10.2134/jpa1989.0257	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jpa1989.0257													WOS:A1989AL22300013

L.; Sier, Mark J.; Davies, Gareth R.; Kroon, Dick			An astronomically-tuned climate framework for hominins in the Turkana Basin	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Understanding the influence of orbital climate cycles on hominin evolution remains a key challenge in paleoanthropology. The two major unresolved issues are: the absence of a climate proxy yielding high-resolution (< 20 kyr) terrestrial climate records, and the lack of age control on hominin fossil occurrences at sufficiently high resolution. Here we present a novel climate proxy, strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) of lacustrine fish fossils from the Turkana Basin, that solves these issues by recording orbitally forced variation in summer monsoon intensity over the Ethiopian Highlands. We successfully applied the climate proxy to a similar to 150 kyr time interval of similar to 2 million year old paleolake deposits containing hominin fossils. Existing age control of the studied interval was improved by a new magnetostratigraphic record precisely locating the base of the Olduvai chron (C2n) near the bottom of the sequence. Spectral analysis demonstrates that Sr-87/Sr-86 variability is primarily determined by precession, which enables us to place hominin fossils in an astronomically-tuned climate framework. The Sr climate proxy is potentially applicable to all hominin-bearing lake deposits in the Turkana Basin, ranging in age from similar to 4.2 to 0.8 million years ago (Ma). Our results demonstrate that between similar to 2 and 1.85 Ma the Turkana Basin remained well-watered and inhabited by hominins even during periods of precession maxima when summer monsoon intensity was lowest. This is in contrast to other basins in the East African Rift System (EARS) that were impacted heavily by precession-forced droughts. We hypothesize that during lake phases, the Turkana Basin was an aridity refugium for permanent-water dependent fauna - including hominins - over the precessional climate cycles.

The influence Of climate fluctuations on summer and fill reservoir inflows was investigated and a reservoir operation model developed to simulate Capilano Reservoir operations. Flow records for the gauge on the Capilano River above Intake were adjusted to account for releases from the upstream Palisade Lake. It was found that reservoir inflows for the June to September period are affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The 15 lowest June to September inflows over the period of gauge records have all been associated with warm or neutral ENSO conditions typically combined with warm or neutral PDO conditions. Annual reservoir drawdown, defined a, the annual extended period of no spill, was used as an indicator of stress on reservoir operations. Simulation of reservoir inflows and outflows from 1914 to 2005 showed that the longest reservoir drawdown durations were almost always associated with warm ENSO and warm PDO conditions. This shortest periods of drawdown were normally associated with both cool ENSO and cool PDO conditions. Due to the storage effects, reservoir drawdown is a good indicator of periodic climate variations because of amplification, similar to the sensitivity of glaciers to climate episodes.																			0701-1784					SUM	2008	33	2			SI		155	163		10.4296/cwrj3302155	http://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj3302155													WOS:000261499200005

In order to analyze the different situations during which thermal breezes were recorded, we used data over the period 1990-2022 from the weather station at Sidi Ahmed aerodrome and those from the DAVIS station that we managed in the summer of 2020. Mobile measurements were also carried out in August 2021 and August 2022. Lastly, remote sensing data were used: land cover, surface temperature, Sky View Factor (FVC) maps. The land-sea thermal contrasts give rise to the sea breezes and the land breezes. The latter are split by the breezes that flow on the slopes of jebel Ennadhour. The sea breezes are more frequent in summer, a season during which they are observed for two thirds of the days. They blow at an average speed of 6 m.s(-1) from the north and east because of the shape of the coastline. These sea breezes are often preceded by a breeze blowing from the Lake of Bizerte to the south. The land breezes have speeds not exceeding 3 m.s(-1). Their trajectory, influenced by the topography, runs along low plains and valleys. In the city, the urban morphology and the disposition towards the coast impact both the orientation and the speed of the breezes. For ways parallel to the direction of the sea breezes, when they are wide and shallow, average wind speeds oscillate between 3 m.s(-1) (at the start of afternoon) and 4 m.s(-1) (at the end of afternoon). The more deeply and less wide ways of the same orientation show higher average speeds, which rise from 4 to 7 m.s-1 between the beginning and the end of the afternoon.																			1958-573X						2024	20									10.4000/12ceh	http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/12ceh													WOS:001367167500002
J	Nolan, M				Nolan, M.			Quantitative and qualitative constraints on hind-casting the formation of multiyear lake-ice covers at Lake El'gygytgyn	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Analysis of the 3.6 Ma, 318 m long sediment core from Lake El' gygytgyn suggests that the lake was covered by ice for millennia at a time for much of its history and therefore this paper uses a suite of existing, simple, empirical degree-day models of lake-ice growth and decay to place quantitative constraints on air temperatures needed to maintain a permanent ice cover on the lake. We also provide an overview of the modern climatological and physical processes that relate to lake-ice growth and decay as a basis for evaluating past climate and environmental conditions. Our modeling results indicate that modern annual mean air temperature would only have to be reduced by 3.3 C 0.9 C to initiate a multiyear ice cover and a temperature reduction of at least 5.5 C 1.0 C is likely needed to completely eliminate direct air water exchange of oxygen, conditions that have been inferred at Lake El'gygytgyn from the analysis of sediment cores. Once formed, a temperature reduction of only 1-3 C relative to modern may be all that is required to maintain multiyear ice. We also found that formation of multiyear ice covers requires that positive degree days are reduced by about half the modern mean, from about +608 to +322. A multiyear ice cover can persist even with summer temperatures sufficient for a two-month long thawing period, including a month above +4 C. Thus, it is likely that many summer biological processes and some lake-water warming and mixing may still occur beneath multiyear ice-covers even if air water exchange of oxygen is severely restricted.																			1814-9324	1814-9332					2013	9	3					1253	1269		10.5194/cp-9-1253-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-1253-2013													WOS:000322859700017

Mean annual density of Diporeia was 1.7 times greater, and production was 2.7 times greater, at 50 in than at 30 in. Animals at both depths fed more or less continuously from April through November, but gilt fullness was greatest in spring. Isotopic analyses suggested that, whereas Diporeia preferentially consumes freshly deposited diatoms when they are available, most of their carbon is derived from bacteria. The importance of littoral diatoms appeared to increase with proximity to shallow water.																			0380-1330						2002	28	2					228	239		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70579-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70579-0													WOS:000176424300011

Magnitude and frequency of wet years under a megadrought climate in the western Great Basin, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Megadroughts are not devoid of interannual precipitation variability. However, the frequency and magnitude of occasional wet years must be limited in order to be consistent with geologic evidence indicating terminal lake lowstands during past megadroughts. We present a series of hydrologic model simulations of Walker Lake, a western Great Basin terminal lake, where varying return intervals of increased cool-season (October-April) precipitation are superimposed upon a megadrought climate. Estimated megadrought lowstands are achieved with wetter years returning every 5-10 years. Total cool season moisture transport derived from the 20th Century Reanalysis between 1895 and 2012 A.D. was positively correlated with cool-season precipitation during the corresponding year (0.49, p < 0.01). Daily moisture transport exceeding the 95th percentile is used as a surrogate for atmospheric river events. Wetter (drier) years had a greater (lesser) fraction of total cool season transport occurring on atmospheric river days, indicating their important role in driving western Great Basin hydroclimate variability.

Lake Temperature and Ice Cover Regimes in the Alaskan Subarctic and Arctic: Integrated Monitoring, Remote Sensing, and Modeling1	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Lake surface regimes are fundamental attributes of lake ecosystems and their interaction with the land and atmosphere. High latitudes may be particularly sensitive to climate change, however, adequate baselines for these lakes are often lacking. In this study, we couple monitoring, remote sensing, and modeling techniques to generate baseline datasets of lake surface temperature and ice cover in the Alaskan Subarctic and Arctic. No detectable trends were observed during this study period, but a number of interesting patterns were noted among lakes and between regions. The largest Arctic lake was relatively unresponsive to air temperature, while the largest Subarctic lake was very responsive likely because it is fed by glacial runoff. Mean late summer water temperatures were higher than air temperatures with differences ranging from 1.7 to 5.4 degrees C in Subarctic lakes and from 2.4 to 3.2 degrees C in Arctic lakes. The warmest mean summer water temperature in both regions was in 2004, with the exception of Subarctic glacially fed lake that was highest in 2005. Ice-out timing had high coherence within regions and years, typically occurring in late May in Subarctic and in early-July in Arctic lakes. Ice-on timing was more dependent on lake size and depth, often varying among lakes within a region. Such analyses provide an important baseline of lake surface regimes at a time when there is increasing interest in high-latitude water ecosystems and resources during an uncertain climate future.

Multiproxy analysis provides a deeper, multiangled interpretation of the palaeoclimate information recorded in speleothems. This work analyses the environmental information recorded by the 518O, 513C, growth rate, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of multiple stalagmites, and other proxies of lake sediments in Southwest China during the mid-to-late Holocene. The results indicate that (1) the 518O and 513C values of stalagmite FL2 showed a gradually positive trend and were consistent with the decreasing pattern of precipitation affected by the Asian summer monsoon during 6.2-0.69 ka BP. (2) In the three periods of 6.2-4.2, 4.2-2.2 and 2.2-0.69 ka BP, the 518O and 513C values of stalagmite FL2 showed positive-negative-positive trends, respectively. Accordingly, the Mg/Ca ratios showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing trend, corresponding to the decreasing-increasing-decreasing variation characteristics of precipitation. The growth rate was sensitive to the increased precipitation from 4.2 to 2.2 ka BP. (3) The 518O and 513C values changed positively, and the Mg/ Ca and Sr/Ca ratios increased when extreme climate events occurred (e.g. 5.5, 4.2, 2.8 and 1.0 ka event) in the mid-to-late Holocene. The multiple geochemical proxies of stalagmite FL2 corresponded well with the records in other stalagmites and lake sediments in Southwest China. (4) Principal component analysis (PCA) and power spectral analysis reveal that the 518O values of stalagmite FL2 mainly respond to the changes in the Asian summer monsoon intensity at decadal to centennial scales and even longer. The 513C values and Mg/Ca and Sr/ Ca ratios mainly reflect decadal and multidecadal variability in regional precipitation.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 15	2025	666								112831	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112831	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112831		FEB 2025											WOS:001435378500001

Paleolimnological records reveal how primary producers have responded to past environmental changes and thus provide insight on their future shifts. Sedimentary pigments are molecular biomarkers that can record detailed information about soft-bodied algae and cyanobacteria, which are not well represented by more conventional proxies. We analyzed diverse sedimentary pigments (echinenone, okenone, alloxanthin, canthaxanthin, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll-a and its degradation products) from two cores using HPLC-MS, as well as bulk sediment organic and inorganic geochemistry, to reconstruct Holocene changes in primary production in a small, subarctic lake in South Greenland. We find multi-proxy evidence for a multi-millennial, mid-Holocene period of hypolimnetic anoxia from 6650 to 3500 cal yr BP within part of the lake. We suggest that summer thermal stratification and high productivity driven by warmer-than-present temperatures and increased catchment-derived nutrient influx drove changes in summer lakewater oxygenation. Our reconstructions reveal two distinct steady ecosystem states associated with oxygen status: a eukaryotic algae-dominated community during oxic conditions, versus cyanobacterial dominance during periods with anoxic bottom waters. Notably, we find that markers of anoxia and associated ecosystem shifts are stronger and probably longer-lived at one coring site, secondarily revealing considerable spatial (in addition to temporal) heterogeneity in oxygenation. As such, we propose that multi-core comparisons in paleolimnology can capture biogeochemical changes across both space and time, even in small lakes, and that spatial variations can provide clues about potentially localized drivers of past limnological change. Overall, our work broadly indicates that primary producer communities in some subarctic lakes were highly sensitive to warmer-than-present temperatures in the mid-Holocene, with landscape processes and thermal stratification playing secondary roles in driving productivity shifts. This implies that future warming could prompt widespread transformations in Arctic lake ecosystems, biogeochemistry (including carbon cycling and oxygenation), and water quality.

Meteorites and impact structures in Chad	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The large surface of Chad (fifth largest country in Africa) as well as a desert climate over much of its area, makes the country a potentially prolific place to recover meteorites and identify impact structures. However, only two meteorite finds have so far been reported, from Tibesti, and two probable falls have been recovered in the vicinity of the capital N'Djamena in the early 1960s. We report on two more recent meteorite falls, Andila and Boutel-Fil, occurring in 2014 and 2023, respectively. All these meteorites are ordinary chondrites, one LL, one L and four H. Chad has two proven eroded impact structures circa 15-20 km in diameter: Aorounga and GweniFada. A number of potential impact structures have also been proposed. The most promising ones are the Faya, Lac Iro and Mousso structures, with diameters of 2, 13 and 3.5 km, respectively. Other previously proposed structures, near the Libyan border, are most probably of magmatic origin. Based on geomorphological and geological arguments, the presence of the Iro lake cannot be readily explained by any process other than impact and its investigation should be a priority based on its size and potential interest as a paleoclimatic recorder. We also suggest that a 35 km diameter structure named Ehi Gidaha, buried under the Devonian sandstones from south Tibesti, may be of impact origin. All proven or potential impact structures are located in the Sahara part of northern Chad, except Lac Iro.					; Gattacceca, Jerome/AAG-5651-2019; Rochette, Pierre/O-4612-2019	Rochette, Pierre/0000-0002-7362-0660; 													1464-343X	1879-1956				FEB	2024	210								105137	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105137		DEC 2023											WOS:001138650100001

A comparative study was carried out on the aquatic insect diversity of two different ponds, one in an urban area (urban pond, UP) and another in a rural area (Jalinga pond, JP). Two seasonal collections (postmonsoon and winter) were made to check the pollution status of the two ponds based on the aquatic insect community and physicochemical properties of water. Consequently, 29 species, 17 families, and 5 orders of aquatic insects from UP and 17 species, 8 families, and 3 orders from JP were recorded. Aphelonecta sp., Cloeon sp., and Micronecta sp. were the eudominant species recorded. According to the Shannon (H') index, UP was more diverse than JP. Family level biotic indices and scores further proved the better water quality of UP than of JP. Hence, it can be said that urban ponds have an important role to play in biodiversity conservation.

This study investigates the geochemical evolution of groundwater and the groundwater flow system in this volcanic aquifer system using hydrochemistry and environmental tracers. Water types of groundwater were found to transform from Ca-Mg-HCO3 (western part of Lake Abaya area) to Na-HCO3 (northwestern part), from the highland down to the Rift Valley. Silicate hydrolysis and Ca/Na ion exchange are the major geochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry along the flow path. Groundwaters are of meteoric origin. The delta O-18 and delta D content of groundwater ranges from -4.9 to -1.1 parts per thousand and -27 to 5 parts per thousand, respectively. The delta O-18 and delta D values that lie on the summer local meteoric water line indicate that the groundwater was recharged mainly by summer rainfall. delta C-13(DIC) values of cold groundwater range from -12 to -2.7 parts per thousand, whereas delta C-13(DIC) of thermal groundwater ranges from -8.3 to +1.6 parts per thousand. The calculated delta C-13(CO2(g)) using delta C-13(DIC) and DIC species indicates the uptake of soil CO2 for cold groundwater and the influx of magmatic CO2 through deep-seated faults for thermal groundwater. In the western part of Lake Abaya area, the shallow and deep groundwater are hydraulically connected, and the uniform water type is consistent with a fast flow of large gradient. In contrast, in the northern part of Lake Abaya area, water underwent deep circulation and slow flow, so the water types-e.g. high F- (up to 5.6 mg/L) and Na+-varied laterally and vertically.

For salmonid fish, migration creates opportunities for feeding and growth, but it is also associated with increased mortality risk. Such trade-offs likely differ between the sexes, since reproductive output is more closely tied to body size in females than males. However, testing hypotheses on sex-specific migratory behaviour in would-be first-time migratory salmonids is difficult, since sexes are generally morphologically indistinguishable prior to maturation. Previous studies have evaluated the influence of sex on migration based on dissection of migratory juveniles or the sex ratio of returning adults. However, both approaches are potentially biased by differential survival during migration. Here, we utilise advances in minimally invasive genetic sex-determination methods for salmonids to investigate sex-specific, spring out-migration propensity in potamodromous brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a pre-Alpine, central European lake. We show that there are marked differences in migratory behaviour between males and females, with small (similar to 10 cm) females being approximately twice as likely to migrate out of their natal river in spring compared to similarly sized males, which generally migrate for the first time at larger sizes (in similar proportions to larger females). This study highlights how novel genetic sex-determination techniques can provide insight into the sex- and size-specific life-history trade-offs that shape migration propensity. Moving forward, these techniques should become useful tools for ecologists and fisheries managers.					; Lavender, Edward/KIG-6734-2024; Selz, Oliver/AAH-7732-2020	Lavender, Edward/0000-0002-8040-7489; Stalder, Dominique/0000-0001-9649-580X													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2024	33	1								10.1111/eff.12745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12745		AUG 2023											WOS:001051237700001

Radiocarbon (C-14) dating, tephrochronology, and geochemical signatures, including bromine (Br), iodine (I), total sulfur (TS), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were applied to continuous sediment core from Lake Ogawara to estimate salinity changes. The core has two tephra layers, the Towada eruption (To-a; approximately 915 CE) and the Changbaishan eruption (B-Tm; 946 CE). An age model for the core was established using plant macro remain C-14 ages constrained by a B-Tm tephra. The depletion of marine-derived elements (Br, I, and TS) was observed in 2200-2000 cal BP layers, indicating a paleosalinity change from saline to brackish conditions caused by falling sea levels during the late Holocene. Variations in Br, I, TOC, and TN concentrations were significantly changed compared to those below the B-Tm layer. High correlations between Br and TOC and I and TOC above the B-Tm tephra layer to the surface indicated an organic source for the halogens post the Changbaishan eruption, indicating a change to the hydrological system of the lake's watershed. The increasing variation in the C/N atomic ratio in the post-B-Tm sediments also supported this hydrological change. Two recorded significant volcanic eruptions could have triggered these changes to the Lake Ogawara water inflow system.

J	Månsson, J; Hämäläinen, L				Mansson, Johan; Hamalainen, Louise			Spring stopover patterns of migrating Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus): temperature as a predictor over a 10-year period	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The decision by birds to stop or not (i.e. stopover decisions) during migration can affect their fitness and also the function of ecosystems, as well as, in a detrimental way, agricultural activities by grazing, trampling and nutrient translocation. We studied how temperature influences the stopover pattern of a large grazing waterfowl. Specifically, we compared the variation in the duration, start and end of the stopover period of Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) with temperatures during the pre-arrival period at Lake Tysslingen in south-central Sweden during a 10-year period. The start day of the stopover period was negatively correlated to the mean temperature of the pre-arrival period. However, the temperature during the pre-arrival period did not explain the variation in the end of the stopover period. Furthermore, the duration of the stopover period was negatively correlated to the start but not to the end of the stopover period. This pattern follows observations that temperature is closely linked to food supply and availability of open water in other waterfowl. In the light of our findings, we conclude that an increased temperature will result in a spatial and temporal shift in the stopover pattern of Whooper Swans along the migration route, and in our specific case the birds will probably arrive earlier in spring and consequently stay longer within the studied area. Moreover, the prolonged stay at the stopover site will probably also result in increased grazing pressure and risk of damage to crops.

J	Henne, PD; Hu, FS				Henne, Paul D.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Holocene climatic change and the development of the lake-effect snowbelt in Michigan, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake-effect snow is an important constraint on ecological and socio-economic systems near the North American Great Lakes Little is known about the Holocene history of lake-effect snowbelts, and it is difficult to decipher how lake-effect snowfall abundance affected ecosystem development. We conducted oxygen-Isotope analysis of calcite in lake-sediment cores from northern Lower Michigan to infer Holocene climatic variation and assess snowbelt development The two lakes experience the same synoptic-scale climatic systems, but only one of them (Huffman Lake) receives a significant amount of lake-effect snow. A 177-cm difference in annual snowfall causes groundwater inflow at Huffman Lake to be O-18-depleted by 2 3 parts per thousand relative to O'Brien Lake. To assess when the lake-effect snowbelt became established, we compared calcite-delta O-18 profiles of the last 11,500 years from these two sites. The chronologies are based on accelerator-mass-spectrometry C-14 ages of 11 and 17 terrestrial-plant samples from Huffman and O'Brien lakes, respectively. The values of delta O-18 are low at both sites from 11,500 to 9500 cal yr BP when the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) exerted a dominant control over the regional climate and provided periodic pulses of meltwater to the Great Lakes basin Carbonate delta O-18 increases by 2.6 parts per thousand at O'Brien Lake and by 1 4 parts per thousand at Huffman Lake between 9500 and 7000 cal yr BP, suggesting a regional decline in the proportion of runoff derived from winter precipitation The Great Lakes snowbelt probably developed between 9500 and 5500 cal yr BP as Inferred from the progressive O-18-depletion at Huffman Lake relative to O'Brien Lake, with the largest increase of lake-effect snow around 7000 cal yr BR Lake-effect snow became possible at this time because of increasing contact between the Great Lakes and frigid arctic air. These changes resulted from enhanced westerly flow over the Great Lakes as the LIS collapsed, and from rapidly rising Great Lakes levels during the Nipissing Transgression. The delta O-18 difference between Huffman and O'Brien lakes declines after 5500 cal yr BP, probably because of a northward shift of the polar vortex that brought increasing winter precipitation to the entire region However, delta O-18 remains depleted at Huffman Lake relative to O'Brien Lake because of the continued production of lake-effect snow.

Vertical distribution of fish biomass in lake superior: Implications for day bottom trawl surveys	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Evaluation of the biases in sampling methodology is essential for understanding the limitations of abundance and biomass estimates of fish populations. Estimates from surveys that rely solely on bottom trawls may be particularly vulnerable to bias if pelagic fish are numerous. We evaluated the variability in the vertical distribution of fish biomass during the U.S. Geological Survey's annual spring bottom trawl survey of Lake Superior using concurrent hydroacoustic observations to (1) test the assumption that fish are generally demersal during the day and (2) evaluate the potential for predictive models to improve bottom trawl-determined biomass estimates. Our results indicate that the assumption that fish exhibit demersal behavior during the annual spring bottom trawl survey in Lake Superior is unfounded. Bottom trawl biomass (B-BT) estimates (mean +/- SE) for species known to exhibit pelagic behavior (cisco Coregonus artedi, bloater C. hoyi, kiyi C. kiyi, and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax; 3.01 +/- 0.73 kg/ha) were not significantly greater than mean acoustic pelagic zone biomass (B-APZ) estimates (6.39 +/- 2.03 kg/ha). Mean B-APZ estimates were 1.6- to 4.8-fold greater than mean B-BT estimates over 4 years of sampling. The relationship between concurrent B-APZ and B-BT estimates was marginally significant and highly variable. Predicted B-APZ estimates using cross-validation models were sensitive to adjustments for back-transforming from the logarithmic to the linear scale and poorly corresponded to observed B-APZ estimates. We conclude that statistical models to predict B-APZ from day B-BT cannot be developed. We propose that night sampling with multiple gears will be necessary to generate better biomass estimates for management needs.

The study employs techniques such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition, MannKendall mutation and other methods to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme precipitation index in northern Shanxi and their correlation with atmospheric circulation. The research results show that: the absolute index, relative index, intensity index and sustained dry period index (CDD) in the continuous index appear from southwest to northeast. The spatial distribution characteristics of the central region decrease, while the continuous wet period (CWD) decreases from the central to the east and west. The three indices Rx1day, Rx5day, and CWD mutated in 1978, 1975, and 1983 respectively, and other extreme precipitation indices all appeared in a sudden change from a low-value period to a high-value period occurred around 2010. In the high-value years of the summer extreme precipitation index, there is a significant negative anomaly in the height field in the mid-high latitude regions of Eurasia. Northern Shanxi is controlled by a broad low-pressure trough in the Lake Baikal area. Water vapor transported via the east, west, and south routes converges in the northern Shanxi region and encounters cold air from the north. There is a strong upward motion anomaly at 500 hPa in the troposphere, and the dynamic conditions of upper-level divergence and lower-level convergence lead to more summer extreme precipitation in the northern Shanxi region. Conversely, in the low-value years of the summer extreme precipitation index, northern Shanxi is affected by a strong high-pressure ridge north of Lake Baikal. There is a downward motion anomaly at 500 hPa, and the northern Shanxi region lacks water vapor. The cold and warm air cannot converge, and both the water vapor conditions and dynamic conditions are poor, which is not conducive to the production of extreme precipitation in northern Shanxi.																			2097-1583	2949-7302				APR	2024	16	2					84	97		10.1016/j.rcar.2024.03.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcar.2024.03.007		JUN 2024											WOS:001273364300001

The younger dryas cooling in northeast Germany: summer temperature and environmental changes in the Friedlander Grosse Wiese region	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A lake sediment record from the Friedlander Grobe Wiese in northeast Germany was studied to reconstruct summer temperature changes associated with changes in vegetation development during the Weichselian Lateglacial. The record was analysed for pollen, chironomids, and oxygen and carbon isotopes of lake marl. The combination of radiocarbon dates, the presence of the Laacher See Tephra and correlation of lithological and palynological changes with other records from the region indicated that the record encompassed the Allerod to the early Holocene. Pollen assemblages reflect development of birch and later pine-dominated forests during the Allerod, comparable to other sites in the region. Chironomid-inferred mean July air temperatures (C-IT) for this period range between similar to 14.0 and 14.8 degrees C. A temporary decrease in C-IT of similar to 1 degrees C, a negative shift in the isotope records, and a minor decline of birch may correspond to Greenland Interstadial 1b. Even though the transition to the Younger Dryas appears to be affected by reworking and redeposition processes, a drop in C-IT to similar to 11.1 degrees C is reconstructed for the later part of the Younger Dryas, while it appears that pine locally persisted in the region. Comparison with a nearby pollen record further indicates a local expansion of wetland grasses during this period. At the transition to the Holocene, C-IT increased to similar to 15.7 degrees C, while birch and pine forests re-expanded.

Connectivity and habitat type shape divergent dispersal behavior in a desert-dwelling fish	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Dispersal has important fitness consequences for individuals, populations, and species. Despite growing theoretical insights into the evolution of dispersal, its behavioral underpinnings remain empirically understudied, limiting our understanding of the extent and impact of responses to landscape-level heterogeneity of environments, and increasing the risk of inferring species-level responses from biased population sampling. Objectives We asked if predictable ecological variation among naturally fragmented arid waterbodies is correlated with disparate dispersal responses of populations of the desert goby Chlamydogobius eremius, which naturally inhabits two habitat "types" (permanent springs, ephemeral rivers), and different levels of hydrological connectivity (high and low) that potentially convey different costs and benefits of dispersal. Methods To test for possible behavioral divergence between such populations, we experimentally compared the movement behaviors (correlates of emigration and exploration) of wild-caught fish. We used two biologically relevant spatial scales to test movement relevant to different stages of the dispersal process. Results Behavior differed at both spatial scales, suggesting that alternative dispersal strategies enable desert gobies to exploit diverse habitat patches. However, while emigration was best predicted by the connectivity (flood risk) of fish habitats, exploration was linked to their habitat type (spring versus river). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that despite a complex picture of ecological variation, key landscape factors have an overarching effect on among-population variation in dispersal traits. Implications include the maintenance of within-species variation, potentially divergent evolutionary trajectories of naturally or anthropogenically isolated populations, and the direction of future experimental studies on the ecology and evolution of dispersal behavior.					; Moran, Nicholas/AAX-8224-2021; Chapple, David/B-9073-2008	Wong, Bob/0000-0001-9352-6500; Moran, Nicholas/0000-0002-7331-0400; Chapple, David/0000-0002-7720-6280													0921-2973	1572-9761				MAY	2017	32	5					1065	1078		10.1007/s10980-017-0509-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-017-0509-8													WOS:000400233800010
J	Chapman, A; Lane, JAK				Chapman, A; Lane, JAK			Waterfowl usage of wetlands in the south-east arid interior of Western Australia 1992-93	EMU												This paper reports the use by 35 waterfowl species of 23 wetlands in the south-east interior of Western Australia following the wettest year on record for much of the region. The majority of the wetlands are saline with individual wetlands varying from brackish to hyper-saline over relatively short periods that markedly affected use by waterfowl. Some freshwater wetlands supported more species (but not individuals) than saline ones, although the salt lakes were significant functioning wetlands supporting greater numbers of certain species. Onset of breeding for early breeding species is two months after the rainfall event. Probably a short period of maximum biological productivity follows initial filling which also triggers breeding enhanced by the fact that these wetlands were all dry previous to this rainfall event. Breeding did not appear to extend into a second season despite adequate water levels and was not inhibited by low winter temperatures.																			0158-4197					MAR	1997	97		1				51	59		10.1071/MU97005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU97005													WOS:A1997XC17800005

This relationship is marked by periods of lower delta C-13(TOC) values corresponding to higher TIC and TOC. Along with TOC/TN, the correlation between delta C-13(TOC) and delta C-13(TIC) suggests that most of the organic matter in the core is from aquatic primary production within the lake. The combination of TOC, TIC, and delta C-13(TOC) is able to disentangle long-term glacial/interglacial cycles and, to a lesser extent, millennial scale climate variability. Over the longer term, delta C-13(TOC) shows modest variability, indicating that the delta C-13 of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool is stabilised by the supply of karst spring water characterised by delta C-13(DIC) influenced by the bedrock delta C-13 value, and the long residence time of the lake water and well mixed upper water column promoting equilibration with atmospheric CO2. However, comparison between arboreal pollen (AP%), TIC and TOC data indicates that the delta C-13(TOC) signal is modulated by the leaching of soil CO2 through runoff and spring discharge, changes in primary productivity, and recycling of organic matter within the lake, all affecting delta C-13(DIC). Exceptionally low delta C-13(TOC) during some interglacial periods (e.g. MIS7 and MIS9) possibly indicate rapid intensification of organic matter recycling and/or increasing stratification and enhanced methanogenesis, even if the latter process is not supported by the sedimentological data.

The waters and sediments in the Central California Coast agricultural region contain widespread and diverse L. monocytogenes populations, and all the isolates contain intact virulence genes. A 5-year survey of public access surface waters in an agricultural region of the Central California Coast was done to assess the prevalence of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In nature, L. monocytogenes lives as a saprophyte in soil and water, which are reservoirs for contamination of preharvest produce. Moore swabs were deployed biweekly in lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers during 2011 to 2016. L. monocytogenes was recovered in 1,224 of 2,922 samples, resulting in 41.9% prevalence. Multiple subtypes were isolated from 97 samples, resulting in 1,323 L. monocytogenes isolates. Prevalence was higher in winter and spring and after rain events in some waterways. Over 84% of the isolates were serotype 4b. Whole-genome sequencing was done on 1,248 isolates, and in silico multilocus sequence typing revealed 74 different sequence types (STs) and 39 clonal complexes (CCs). The clones most isolated, CC639, CC183, and CC1, made up 27%, 19%, and 13%, respectively, of the sequenced isolates. Other types were CC663, CC6, CC842, CC4, CC2, CC5, and CC217. All sequenced isolates contained intact copies of core L. monocytogenes virulence genes, and pathogenicity islands LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 73% and 63%, respectively, of the sequenced isolates. The virulence factor internalin A was predicted to be intact in all but four isolates, while genes important for sanitizer and heavy metal resistance were found in <5% of the isolates. These waters are not used for crop irrigation directly, but they are available to wildlife and can flood fields during heavy rains. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b and 1/2a strains are implicated in most listeriosis, and hypervirulent listeriosis stems from strains containing pathogenicity islands LIPI-3 and LIPI-4. The waters and sediments in the Central California Coast agricultural region contain widespread and diverse L. monocytogenes populations, and all the isolates contain intact virulence genes. Emerging clones CC183 and CC639 were the most abundant clones, and major clones CC1, CC4, and CC6 were well represented. CC183 was responsible for three produce-related outbreaks in the last 7 years. Most of the isolates in the survey differ from those of lesser virulence that are often isolated from foods and food processing plants because they contain genes encoding an intact virulence factor, internalin A, and most did not contain genes for sanitizer and heavy metal resistance. This isolate collection is important for understanding L. monocytogenes populations in agricultural and natural regions.

Individual Cell Based Traits Obtained by Scanning Flow-Cytometry Show Selection by Biotic and Abiotic Environmental Factors during a Phytoplankton Spring Bloom	PLOS ONE												In ecology and evolution, the primary challenge in understanding the processes that shape biodiversity is to assess the relationship between the phenotypic traits of organisms and the environment. Here we tested for selection on physio-morphological traits measured by scanning flow-cytometry at the individual level in phytoplankton communities under a temporally changing biotic and abiotic environment. Our aim was to study how high-frequency temporal changes in the environment influence biodiversity dynamics in a natural community. We focused on a spring bloom in Lake Zurich (Switzerland), characterized by rapid changes in phytoplankton, water conditions, nutrients and grazing (mainly mediated by herbivore ciliates). We described bloom dynamics in terms of taxonomic and trait-based diversity and found that diversity dynamics of trait-based groups were more pronounced than those of identified phytoplankton taxa. We characterized the linkage between measured phytoplankton traits, abiotic environmental factors and abundance of the main grazers and observed weak but significant correlations between changing abiotic and biotic conditions and measured size-related and fluorescence-related traits. We tested for deviations in observed community-wide distributions of focal traits from random patterns and found evidence for both clustering and even spacing of traits, occurring sporadically over the time series. Patterns were consistent with environmental filtering and phenotypic divergence under herbivore pressure, respectively. Size-related traits showed significant even spacing during the peak of herbivore abundance, suggesting that morphology-related traits were under selection from grazing. Pigment distribution within cells and colonies appeared instead to be associated with acclimation to temperature and water chemistry. We found support for trade-offs among grazing resistance and environmental tolerance traits, as well as for substantial periods of dynamics in which our measured traits were not under selection.

These rates were calculated on a spatial and temporal scale for the purpose of finding changes in response to wind action. In a spatial analysis, the rates of change of the phytoplankton presented a broader range in the North. This upper limit was recorded in spring (0.38 h(-1)). The rate of change in the phytoplankton community was very high on average (greater than or equal to0.10 h(-1)) indicating the occurrence of intense, rapid environmental changes. Sudden changes in the rates occurred in a point form, due to population substitution. These substitutions resulted from wind action, alternating periods of strong sediment resuspension with periods of quiet.					; de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; 													0018-8158					MAY	2003	497	1-3					1	12																WOS:000185009200001

Late Quaternary palaeoclimatic records from the Indian Himalaya and Ganga foreland basin: Assessment on current understanding and future prospective	QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												In this comprehensive review, an extensive analysis has been conducted on paleoclimate datasets from climat-ically sensitive regions in the Indian Himalaya and Indo-Gangetic plain. Our main objective was to gain valuable insights into the broad palaeoclimatic variability during the Late Quaternary-Holocene period. To achieve this, careful categorization was focused for various archives from multi-proxy studies into three groups: glacial moraine, glacio-fluvial and lake records, and speleothems. The compilation of climate records from different geographical settings has revealed an overall coherence during warm and humid phases, with minor variations influenced by variable moisture sources and topographic changes. The analysis reveals that Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) reached its peak during approximately 9-5 ka BP and subsequently weakened around the Mid-Holocene (ca. 4-5 ka BP). Notably, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and early Holocene were characterized by significant glacial advances in the Himalayan region. Furthermore, the sedimentation rates derived from lacustrine records in different regions exhibit considerable variability. In conclusion, the compilation and comparisons of diverse palaeoclimate records have significantly improved our understanding of the regions palaeoclimate. These findings hold substantial value for planning future focused studies in the crucial climatic zone. By refining our understanding of past climate dynamics in the Indian Himalaya and Indo-Gangetic allu-vium, a better comprehension of the regions susceptibility to climate change can be achieved. This, in turn, facilitates informed decisions for sustainable development and environmental management.					; Laskar, Amzad/K-5125-2019; Ambili, Anoop/AAR-7122-2020	Ambili, Anoop/0000-0002-4279-7842; Bohra, Dr. Archna/0000-0003-0597-0885; 													2666-0334					JAN	2024	13								100152	10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100152		DEC 2023											WOS:001136236800001

Summer diet analysis of the invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive species can have both negative and positive impacts on the trophic structure of aquatic systems. Rainbow smelt were first observed in Lake Winnipeg during late 1990 and their impact on upper and lower trophic levels is unclear. To begin to understand the impact of this invasive species in this large, shallow lake, dietary composition of smelt was described. During mid-summer 2008 and 2009, we simultaneously quantified the stomach contents of smelt and characterized the zooplankton community in the North Basin of Lake Winnipeg. Zooplankton and rainbow smelt (total length: 70-130 mm) were collected from ten stations in 2008 and six in 2009 on the M.V. Namao. The relative abundance of four zooplankton prey types (copepods. Daphnia spp., Eubosmina coregoni and Bosmina longirostris) was determined from the zooplankton samples and the smelt stomach contents. Using electivity indices, we found that rainbow smelt preferred Daphnia spp., as well as larger individuals of Daphnia spp., in both years. Preference for larger Daphnia spp. is likely due to conspicuousness (size, movement patterns) and slow swimming speeds relative to the other prey types. With detailed knowledge of the trophic linkage between rainbow smelt and the zooplankton community, we can begin to quantify the effects of invasive rainbow smelt on the food web structure of the lake.

This modu-lation has far-reaching consequences, particularly in facilitating societal shifts documented in northern China. Here, we present a well-dated lake-level record from the Daihai Lake Basin in northern China, providing quantitative assessments of Holocene monsoonal precipitation and the consequent mi-grations of the northern boundary of the EASM. Our reconstruction, informed by a water-and-energy balance model, indicates that annual precipitation reached -700 mm during 8-5 ka, followed by a rapid decline to -550 mm be-tween 5 and 4 ka. This shift coherently aligns with a significant -300 km northwestward movement of the EASM northern boundary during the Middle Holocene (MH), in contrast to its current position. Our findings underscore that these changes cannot be entirely attributed to orbital forcing, as corrob-orated by simulation tests. Climate model simulations deployed in our study suggest that the presence of the Green Sahara during the MH significantly strengthened the EASM and led to a northward shift of the monsoon rainfall belt. Conversely, the Sahara's reversion to a desert landscape in the late Ho-locene was accompanied by a corresponding southward retraction of monsoon influence. These dramatic hydroclimate changes during -5-4 ka likely triggered or at least contributed to a shift in Neolithic cultures and societal transformation in northern China. With decreasing agricultural pro-ductivity, communities transitioned from millet farming to a mixed rainfed agriculture and animal husbandry system. Thus, our findings elucidate not only the variability of the EASM but also the profound implications of a remote forcing, such as surface transformations of the Sahara, on climatic changes and cultural evolution in northern China.

The occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of 77 antibiotics in water and sediment samples from Danjiangkou Reservoir were investigated. Approximately 90% of the detectable concentrations of the 61 and 54 antibiotics found in water and sediment samples were lower than 5.0 ng/L and 1.0 ng/g, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole was the most abundant antibiotic found in water (1.65-149 ng/L, median 6.25 ng/L). In sediment samples, macrolides were frequently detected (42.7-54.5%) at concentrations of ND-4.34 ng/g. Greater diversity and higher levels of antibiotics were generally found in both water and sediment samples in spring than in the other seasons. Composition profiles of antibiotics differed between the two tributary river basins of Danjiangkou Reservoir, indicating different sources of contamination and the influence of water and sediment properties. Four criteria, namely widespread occurrence, correlation with the total antibiotic concentration, and risk to aquatic organisms or to human health, were suggested to select specific indicators for monitoring and pollution control of antibiotics. Five antibiotics were selected as appropriate indicators for Danjiangkou Reservoir, namely sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and anhydrochlortetracycline.

Summer Stream Water Temperature Models for Great Lakes Streams: New York	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Temperature is one of the most important environmental influences on aquatic organisms. It is a primary driver of physiological rates and many abiotic processes. However, despite extensive research and measurements, synoptic estimates of water temperature are not available for most regions, limiting our ability to make systemwide and large-scale assessments of aquatic resources or estimates of aquatic species abundance and biodiversity. We used subwatershed averaging of point temperature measurements and associated multiscale landscape habitat conditions from over 3,300 lotic sites throughout New York State to develop and train artificial neural network models. Separate models predicting water temperature (in cold, cool, and warm temperature classes) within small catchment-stream order groups were developed for four modeling units, which together encompassed the entire state. Water temperature predictions were then made for each stream segment in the state. All models explained more than 90% of data variation. Elevation, riparian forest cover, landscape slope, and growing degree-days were among the most important model predictors of water temperature classes. Geological influences varied among regions. Predicted temperature distributions within stream networks displayed patterns of generally increasing temperature downstream but were patchy due to the averaging of water temperatures within stream size-classes of small drainages. Models predicted coldwater streams to be most numerous and warmwater streams to be generally associated with the largest rivers and relatively flat agricultural areas and urban areas. Model predictions provide a complete, georeferenced map of summer daytime mean stream temperature potential throughout New York State that can be used for planning and assessment at spatial scales from the stream segment class to the entire state.

However, studies addressing wildfire impacts have traditionally focused first on terrestrial systems and second on lotic systems. This bias has left a gap in knowledge related to wildfire effects on some of the emblematic habitats of the Mediterranean region such as temporary ponds. We hypothesise that temporary ponds will experience indirect consequences of wildfires like those of other aquatic systems (e.g. nutrient increases or trophic alterations). However, the fact that temporary ponds are dry during the summer, when most wildfires occur, could add a new path of disturbance such as an impact on organisms aestivating in the pond sediment due to their direct burning. Based on these hypotheses, the present study analyses wildfire impacts on faunal communities adapted to temporality, focusing on species traits related to expected indirect and direct impacts (i.e. dispersal ability, life history or feeding habits). We took advantage of a wildfire (summer 2012) that partially affected a Mediterranean temporary pond network, comparing the environmental and the faunal community responses from before and after the wildfire, and between the burned and unburned ponds during the subsequent hydroperiod. As hypothesised, our results indicated different wildfire effects. First, changes in abundances of some trophic groups from before and after the wildfire but also strong fluctuations at the beginning of the hydroperiod between burned and unburned ponds. Second, a decrease in abundance of organisms that remain in the pond sediment during drought in burned ponds, being probably affected directly by the wildfire. Only one hydroperiod appears to be sufficient for burned ponds to recover their similarity to unburned ponds, which highlights the high resilience of these communities. Despite their resilience, these communities could become compromised in the future since global change scenarios predict increase wildfire frequency and intensity in the Mediterranean region.

Proglacial lake sediment records of Holocene climate change in the western Cordillera of Peru	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment records from proglacial lakes between 9 and 10 S in the western Cordillera of the Peruvian Andes document the waxing and waning of alpine glaciers since the end of the Lateglacial stage. These records from the southern tropical Andes provide supporting evidence that the early Holocene (between 12 and 8 ka) was relatively warm and dry, and the middle Holocene (between 8 and 4 ka) was marked by a shift to cooler, and possibly wetter conditions in certain regions, leading to glacial advances. Although there were multiple periods of brief ice advances that interrupted the overall trend, glaciers in multiple valleys generally retreated from similar to 4.0 ka through the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1.0-0.7 ka). This late Holocene pattern of ice retreat occurred during a period when lake level studies, and both lacustrine and speleothem stable isotopic records indicate wetter conditions relative to the middle Holocene, suggesting that higher temperatures contributed to the pattern of ice retreat. Following this period of glacial retreat, multiple proxy records suggest that the start of the Little Ice Age (similar to 0.6-0.1 ka) was a colder and wetter time throughout much of the tropical Andes. There appear to be two primary synoptic-scale climatic controls on temperature and precipitation linked to insolation dynamics that drive changes in ice cover in the southern tropical Andes during the Holocene: 1) the strength of the South America Summer Monsoon, which is linked to Northern Hemisphere temperatures and the mean position of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone over the Atlantic, and 2) sea surface temperature distributions in the tropical Pacific Ocean and its influence on atmospheric temperature, precipitation and circulation patterns.

Samples were taken from two lotic microhabitats: (i) Jankovac Spring (JS), a hypocrenal habitat with dense bryophyte clusters (90% bottom cover) and (ii) Jankovac Waterfall (JW), with scattered bryophyte clusters (50% bottom cover). At the same time, seston samples were collected during the spring as the source site and after the JW, as the outflow site. The goals of this study were to understand the (i) algal, protozoan and metazoan bryophyte community assemblages in these two lotic microhabitats, (ii) influence of environmental factors on the structuring of the bryophyte community and (iii) structure of seston along the longitudinal profile. A total of 172 taxa were determined: 68 algae, 55 protozoa, 24 meiofauna and 25 macroinvertebrates. Statistically significant differences between two microhabitats differing in percentage of bryophyte cover were established testing 13 environmental parameters. In dense bryophyte clusters, community structure was determined by flow velocity and pH, and macroinvertebrates achieved higher diversity and abundance. On the contrary, in scattered bryophyte coverage algae, protozoa and meiofauna reached higher abundance and diversity governed by the amount of suspended organic matter and epiphyton. In contrast to previous studies, the inverse ratio of community diversity and abundance versus percentage of bryophyte cover was established. We assume this to be the result of an enrichment of the scattered bryophyte clusters by upstream seston. Additionally, the effects of anthropogenic hydromorphological disturbance are reflected in macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance reduction.					; Spoljar, Maria/AAZ-8174-2020; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023	Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528; Spoljar, Maria/0000-0003-1006-8300; Milisa, Marko/0000-0003-3339-0044													0003-4088	2100-000X					2012	48	1					125	138		10.1051/limn/2011057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011057													WOS:000304431400013

Lake geomorphological and lacustrine sedimentological studies show that numerous high lake level stands and/or freshwater lakes occurred in large are;ls of western China at this time, including over the Tibetan Plateau where the area contains mostly shallow water and saline-hypersaline water lakes under extremely dry conditions of today. Pollen-based reconstruction of Tibetan vegetation shows systematic differences from the present: alpine steppe-forests were shifted ca. 400 km further north and the alpine conifer forest extended ca. 400-800 km beyond their present western limits. Variations in delta O-18 curves from ice cores from the Plateau suggest that the temperature was 2-4 degreesC higher and precipitation was 40% to over 100% higher than today. All of the evidence consistently suggests the existence of an exceedingly strong summer monsoon climate over the Plateau. The vigorous evaporation of the tropical ocean surface would also play an important role in promoting the penetration of moisture-rich southwest monsoon over the Tibetan Plateau. These climate patterns with strong summer monsoon circulation during the period 30-40 ka sp reflect the 20 ka earth orbital precessional cycle, when the Tibetan Plateau region received greater solar radiation which thus enlarged the thermodynamical contrast between the Plateau and the mid-south portion of the Indian Ocean.

Overwinter survival of stocked age-0 lake sturgeon	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>Knowledge of age-specific survivorship is critical when developing management prescriptions for imperiled species such as the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). Management has focused on population restoration through hatchery supplementation, largely in the absence of data about relationships between hatchery rearing conditions, size/age at release, and estimates of overwinter survival for stocked age-0 lake sturgeon. Young of the year lake sturgeon were reared from egg to age 3 months in two separate hatchery environments: a streamside hatchery on the natal Upper Black River, Michigan, and a traditional hatchery environment. From age 3 to 6 months all fish were reared in the traditional hatchery. Fish (n = 20) originating from each rearing environment were surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters at 6 months of age (mean total length: 31.4 cm; mean weight: 106.4 g) and released into Black Lake in December 2005. Tracking using manual and automated hydrophones was conducted during April and May 2006 to estimate overwinter survival and to test for differences in survival of fish reared in different hatchery environments. Eighteen fish (45%) were detected, 16 (40%) of which survived the winter (range of distance traveled between observations of surviving fish was 0.09-0.55 km). The remaining fish were not detected. No significant differences in survival were documented due to rearing environment or size at release. This study represents the first quantified estimate of overwinter survival for stocked age-0 lake sturgeon. The minimum estimate of 40% survival through the first winter is encouraging for hatchery programs, and will aid in the development of management prescriptions for this species.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A series of AMS radiocarbon measurements of terrestrial plant macrofossil remains are presented from a lake sequence in southernmost Sweden in an attempt to constrain the age of the Borrobol Tephra. This recently identified ash layer has been frequently suggested as a potentially significant marker horizon for assessing the precise timing of the initial warming in different parts of Europe at the start of Greenland Interstadial 1(GI-1). Two different methods are adopted in order to derive a calendar age estimate for this event. An age of ca 13,900 Cariaco varve yrs BP is derived from a visual wiggle match of the age series to the Cariaco Basin data-set. The second approach is based on Bayesian probability analysis and constrains the age of the Borrobol Tephra in southern Sweden to between 13,800-14,450 and 13,667-14,331 cal yrs BP (95% confidence), using the Cariaco and Lake Suigetsu records as calibration data-sets, respectively. These new age-depth models, together with the pollen stratigraphy, suggest that the Borrobol Tephra as found in southern Sweden falls within the late Older Dryas/GI-1d or the early Allerod/GI-1c, whereas other European sequences indicate that this tephra falls close to the GS-2/GI-1 transition. Whether or not this indicates that the different occurrences of the BT in northern Europe are coeval is discussed and the implications that arise for the application of tephrochronology during this period are outlined.

To address the absence of corresponding region-wide data on Hawaii's microbiota, we compiled the first 16S SSU rDNA clone libraries and cultivated bacteria from five Hawaiian lakes, an anchialine pool, and the Lo'ihi submarine volcano. These sites offer diverse niches over similar to 5000 m elevation and similar to 1150 nautical miles. Each site hosted a distinct prokaryotic community dominated by Bacteria. Cloned sequences fell into 158 groups from 18 Bacteria phyla, while seven were unassigned and two belonged in the Euryarchaeota. Only seven operational taxonomic units ( each OTU comprised sequences that shared greater than or equal to 97% sequence identity) occurred in more than one site. Pure bacterial cultures from all sites fell into 155 groups ( each group comprised pure cultures that shared greater than or equal to 97% 16S SSU rDNA sequence identity) from 10 Bacteria phyla; 15 Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were cultivated from more than one site. One hundred OTUs (60%) and 52 (33.3%) cultures shared < 97% 16S SSU rDNA sequence identity with published sequences. Community structure reflected habitat chemistry; most delta-Proteobacteria occurred in anoxic and sulfidic waters of one lake, while beta-Proteobacteria were cultivated exclusively from fresh or brackish waters. Novel sequences that affiliate with an Antarctic-specific clade of Deinococci, and Candidate Divisions TM7 and BRC1, extend the geographic ranges of these phyla. Globally and locally remote, as well as physically and chemically diverse, Hawaiian aquatic habitats provide unique niches for the evolution of novel communities and microorganisms.					; Pikina, Alla/J-1327-2018; Donachie, Stuart/O-6220-2016; Kempe, Stephan/A-8450-2008	Donachie, Stuart/0000-0002-8322-6915; Pikina, Alla/0000-0001-7232-3288; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				DEC	2004	48	4					509	520		10.1007/s00248-004-0217-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-004-0217-1								15696384					WOS:000226829500007

In the eutrophic Furuike Pond, seasonal successions of Microcystis species and related environmental parameters were investigated between May and November 2006. Microcystis aeruginosa was more abundant than M. wesenbergii in June, August to early October and M. wesenbergii was more abundant in July and between late October and November. The water temperatures during the dominance of M. aeruginosa were relatively higher (from 24.7 to 33.9 degrees C) than those during the dominance of M. wesenbergii (from 19.6 to 28.6 degrees C). In the laboratory experiments where each Microcystis species was cultured under various temperatures, growth rates of M. aeruginosa were significantly higher than those of M. wesenbergii at high temperatures (30 and 35 degrees C). However, growth rates of the two species were similar at lower temperatures (20 and 25 degrees C). Consequently, water temperature changes during summer may be an important environmental factor for the alternating succession of Microcystis species.

Satellite remote sensing of phytoplankton phenology in Lake Balaton using 10 years of MERIS observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton biomass is important to monitor in lakes due to its influence on water quality and lake productivity. Phytoplankton has also been identified as sensitive to environmental change, with shifts in the seasonality of blooms, or phenology, resulting from changing temperature and nutrient conditions. A satellite remote sensing approach to retrieving and mapping freshwater phytoplankton phenology is demonstrated here in application to Lake Balaton, Hungary. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration mapping using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) allows new insights into such spatiotemporal dynamics for Lake Balaton as bloom start, peak and end timing, duration, maximum chl-a concentrations, spatial extent, rates of increase and decrease, and bloom chl-a concentration integral. TIMESAT software is used to extract and map these phenology metrics. Three approaches to time series smoothing are compared and mapped metrics are evaluated in comparison with phenology metrics of in situ chl-a. The high degree of both spatial and temporal variability is highlighted and discussed, as are methodological limitations and correlation between phenology metrics. Both the feasibility of and novel insights permitted through such phenology mapping are demonstrated, and priority topics for future research are suggested. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Jones, BA				Jones, Benjamin A.			Infant health impacts of freshwater algal blooms: Evidence from an invasive species natural experiment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT												Economists are increasingly interested in causally interpretable estimates of environmental health externalities, particularly on infant health. This paper focuses on a specific case by investigating microcystin, a toxin produced by freshwater blue-green algal blooms. We exploit a natural experiment caused by a zebra mussel die-off in a large lake located in the state of Michigan, USA to identify changes in microcystin-related infant outcomes surrounding the lake. Using both the synthetic control method and a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that instances of low birth weight around the lake fell by 1.4 percentage points after lake water quality improved. Along the intensive margin, birth weight and length of gestation increased by 17.1 g and 0.47 weeks, respectively. Improvements to low birth weight result in $768,500 in average annual hospitalization cost savings. Many robustness and falsification tests are performed including using both annual and monthly data and accounting for possible weather confounders and seasonality. Results suggest that microcystin can affect infant health at levels below current water advisory guidelines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In western Slovakia, close to Male Bielice village at the northern margin of the Pannonian-Carpathian boundary, a peat-forming warm spring is uniquely preserved, and it still harbours a rare plant, Cladium mariscus. This site is located in a region that is noteworthy for the occurrence of many rare, light-demanding species that have disjunct distributions or are at the limits of their distributions, which may indicate a long history of treeless habitats there. The geographical position of this study site thus provides a great opportunity to address the perennial debate about in situ relicts and the continuity of grasslands throughout the forest optimum. We analysed a Holocene sediment core for macrofossils of vascular plants, bryophytes and molluscs, and for pollen, which were surprisingly preserved in rather high diversity, which enabled a detailed reconstruction of the landscape history. We further reviewed the archaeological evidence. Using this multi-proxy approach, we were able to confirm (i) the early expansion of mesophilous trees (Ulmus, Fraxinus, Tilia and Quercus) in northern parts of the Carpathian-Pannonian boundary, but the onset of this expansion could not be dated precisely, (ii) the continual persistence of the Cladium mariscus population in the fen, and (iii) existence of open steppes and/or dry grasslands and open wetlands in this region throughout the Holocene. Since the Bronze Age, there are coincidences in the history of human settlement, local development of the fen and regional changes in the representation of particular habitats, including managed wet, mesic and semi-dry grasslands.					; Jamrichová, Eva/JDR-6659-2023; Hájek, Michal/H-1648-2014; Hájková, Petra/H-1588-2014; Hajek, Michal/H-1648-2014	Horsak, Michal/0000-0003-2742-2740; Hajek, Michal/0000-0002-5201-2682; Jamrichova, Eva/0000-0003-1259-9463													0032-7786					SEP	2013	85	3					289	315																WOS:000325118300005

Static incubations of sediments have shown that reductive dissolution of ferric iron (Fe(III)) minerals in the sediment explain these P peaks. This study was set up to identify if that mechanism also dominates in a dynamic system, there by testing the roles of water flow velocity and sediment Fe/P ratio. Decreasing flow velocity was suspected to lower the flux of dissolved oxygen (DO) towards the sediment. The role of the Fe(III)/P ratio was tested by amending iron-rich glauconite sand (GS) to the sediment, in this manner testing possible remediation techniques. Eight flumes (1.80 m long) were constructed with duplicates of four treatments of two laminar flow velocities over the sediment (0.05 m s(-1) or 0.15 m s(-1)) that was either or not amended with GS (10% w/w). In all flumes a daily dose of sodium glutamate was added as a carbon source to mimic wastewater with high BOD, the flumes were operated for 28 days. A decreased velocity lowered the steady-state DO concentration and enhanced the sediment-water release of P by a factor 3. Sediment amendment with GS reduced solution P by factors 3 (low flow velocity) and 2 (high flow velocity). This effect is related to a combination of increasing binding sites for P and of lowering the DO consumption. These experimental data suggest that previously unexplained summer peaks of P in lowland rivers are related to low flow events that limit the DO flux. The internal loading of P requires management of DO in water and can be mitigated by enhancing sediment Fe. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Up to 97% of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy caught by anglers are released, and previous research on catch and release (C&R) for Muskellunge has suggested relatively low mortality rates (0-5%). However, those studies were all conducted within the range of water temperatures that are thermally optimal for Muskellunge and generally at water temperatures less than 25 degrees C. As many Muskellunge populations routinely experience temperatures greater than 25 degrees C during the summer months our objective was to quantify warmwater (>25 degrees C) C&R mortality rates in Muskellunge.Methods: We collected 102 adult Muskellunge (>760 mm) and stocked them into and identify factors influencing mortality by using experimental ponds. Adult Muskellunge (n = 102) were stocked into eight earthen or plastic-lined flow-through ponds (0.06-0.71 ha) at densities less than 16 fish/ha. Muskellunge (n = 50) were angled by utilizing specialized Muskellunge fishing gear at water temperatures of 19.6-32.6 degrees C, with 32 fish being caught at temperatures exceeding 25 degrees C. After being angled, fish were closely monitored for 2 weeks to assess mortality; fish that remained uncaught during the experiment were used as controls (n = 53).Result: Mortality was greater for angled fish (30.0%) than for control fish (11.3%). Differences in C&R mortality were compared across a range of temperature regimes using Firth logistic regression. Five-day cumulative temperature and net time were positively related to the probability of mortality, but size and sex were unrelated to mortality. Increasing C&R mortality with temperature was mitigated somewhat by lower catch rates at higher temperatures. Mortalities per 100 angler-hours were 0 at <25 degrees C, 4.98 at 25.00-27.49 degrees C, 2.48 at 27.5-30.0 degrees C, and 1.17 at >30 degrees C.Conclusion: Recent field studies have identified the importance of thermal refuge in mitigating summer C&R mortality of Muskellunge. This study identified specific temperature conditions responsible for elevated mortality in the absence of refugia. Although increasing temperatures above 25 degrees C led to increasing C&R mortality in our ponds, lower catchability seemingly provided some mitigation. The interactive effects of thermal refugia and catch rates with temperature warrant further investigations into population-level effects at varying levels of exploitation.

East Dongting Lake is a Ramsar site and especially important wintering ground for herbivorous geese along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In this paper, based on annual (2008/09-2016/17) waterbird census data, we investigated the spatial-temporal distributions of three herbivorous goose species (Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Bean Goose Anser fabalis, and Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons) within East Dongting Lake, and analyzed their distribution dynamics (denoted by percentage similarity index, PSI) relative to variations in hydrological regime. The results demonstrated that the distribution of the globally vulnerable Lesser White-fronted Geese changed obviously between years, whereas that of Bean Geese was more stable. Greater White-fronted Geese suffered drastic distribution variation during the study period. The PSI of Lesser White-fronted Geese was negatively correlated with between-year difference in water recession time and mean water level in October, whereas no obvious trend was found in Bean Geese. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to detect changes in food resources of the geese, and significant correlations were also found between NDVI and hydrological factors. It was inferred that the variations in hydrological regime affected the annual distribution dynamics of Lesser White-fronted Geese by changing food conditions; whereas the effect on Bean Geese were not reflected in this study. Species traits may explain the differences in distribution dynamics among the three goose species. It was speculated that Lesser White-fronted Geese might be more sensitive to habitat change, whereas Bean Geese were more resilient. We suggested that regulating hydrological regime was crucial in management works. Our study could offer scientific information for species conservation in the context of habitat changes in East Dongting Lake wetland and provide potential insights into habitat management in this area.

J	OMSTEDT, A; MURTHY, CR				OMSTEDT, A; MURTHY, CR			ON CURRENTS AND VERTICAL MIXING IN LAKE-ONTARIO DURING SUMMER STRATIFICATION	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Currents and vertical mixing characteristics were investigated on the basis of time series of current meter and temperature data from a summer-stratified period in Lake Ontario. The experimental set up consisted of seven current meters distributed in one vertical line from 12 m below the surface to 1 m above the lake bottom at a total depth of 143 m. The period considered for the analysis was from June to September, 1991. The currents showed pronounced oscillations with two significant kinetic energy peaks, one at about 17 hours due to inertial motions, and one at 10 days, probably due to meteorological forcing. The current shear in the hypolimnion was strong enough to overcome stability and generate turbulence (Richardson numbers below 0.25) and there was probably turbulence enough available to keep the matter (almost neutral buoyant particles) in the whole Nepheloid bottom layer in suspension. In the thermocline region the turbulence was mainly damped (Richardson numbers above 1), but some events with lower Richardson numbers were also calculated indicating increased mixing during these events. By analysing filtered and unfiltered current meter data it was found that the shear-generated turbulence in the hypolimnion was mainly due to the meteorologically forced currents. In the thermocline region, however, the vertical shear associated with the inertial oscillation had a greater impact on the mixing.

Altitude varies between 4 and 2315 m a.s.l. among the lakes. Gravity corer was used to take surface samples in the deepest location for contemporary training set. To standardise the taxonomic approach, all chironomid samples taken from the Turkish lakes have compared with the European subfossil larvae collection. In total 68 different subfossil chironomids werefound. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the assemblage data were performed to identify outlying samples. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to examine the distribution of chironomid taxa among the lakes and to relate their distributions to measured environmental variables in dataset. Weighted Averaging-Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) were used to assess the transfer function performance. The statistics of the inference model for summer surface water temperature were analysed as RMSE = 3.03 and r(2) = 0.60. These results are expected to become more consistent as the number of lakes. This study is innovative as the first Turkish chironom id-based temperature calibration set and this will offer much potential for work on temperature reconstructions in Turkey.

The aim of this study was to examine the spatial distribution and the possible source of CDOM for inland water in summer in the northeast china. Absorption spectra of inland water samples were measured from 200nm to 800nm. Highest mean-value of a(375) occurred in Chagan Lake. A significant spatial difference was found among four different inland waters, and evident spatial variation was in Chagan Lake. A consistent negative non-linear relationship was recorded between S value and CDOM absorption coefficient. Furthermore, S value was used as a proxy for CDOM composition and source. Fulvic acids is primary contribution for CDOM absorption in Songhua Lake and Shitoukoumen Reservoir, but humic acids in Nanhu Lake and Chagan Lake. The relationships between CDOM absorption and total suspended matter concentration and chlorophyll-a concentration were analyzed. It demonstrated the biological processes source for Nanhu Lake, Shitoukoumen Reservoir and Chagan Lake. But for Songhua Lake, the dominating source is from river inputs, but biological process was also an important portion for CDOM concentration.																			2153-6996		978-1-4244-9566-5				2010							386	388		10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653684													WOS:000287933800100

The Redon River is a typical case history affluent with a zone open to the lake but quickly closed to upstream migration by the lake dwelling trout. The stocking with fed fry at densities 40-60 ind./ 100(2) supplied an additional recruitment, which can constitute the dominant part of 0 + and 1 + in autumnal standing population. Fry were reared from wild lake dwelling trout eggs issued from an affluent different from the Redon River or from domestic spawned eggs. In open angling areas, colonized or not by lake dwelling spawners, the autumnal standing population sharply decreased between 1 + and > 1 + stages. The comparative results between zones opened or closed to angling suggest the important role played by angling in this evolution. The comparative dynamic of resident trouts and trouts issued from stocked alevins of lacustrine origin in a section closed to angling suggests the existence of a smaller settling rate for trouts of lacustrine origin. An experimentation with fed fry from lacustrine origin suggests the existence of an early downstream migration, concerning fry with the higher initial growth rate. The study showed that: - fed fry from lacustrine or domestic origin, stocked in late-spring or early-summer, supplied lake dwelling trout spawners coming back in the river of stocking, in smaller proportion however for the domestic origin. In spite of their strong contribution at juveniles 0 + and 1 + stages, trouts from domestic origin contributed very few to the return of lake dwelling trout spawners. - in the case of one of the four surveyed cohorts, a limited stocking (6 000 fed fry issued from an other river) has had a major contribution to the stock of lake dwelling trout spawners entering the Redon River. The other releases have had more limited but not null contributions. Results suggest that stocking practices repeated during several decades could have potentially affected the integrity of natural populations.																			0767-2861						2003		369					17	39		10.1051/kmae:2003020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:2003020													WOS:000221764400002

On the contribution of nocturnal heterogeneous reactive nitrogen chemistry to particulate matter formation during wintertime pollution events in Northern Utah	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Mountain basins in Northern Utah, including the Salt Lake Valley (SLV), suffer from wintertime air pollution events associated with stagnant atmospheric conditions. During these events, fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) can exceed national ambient air quality standards. Previous studies in the SLV have found that PM2.5 is primarily composed of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), formed from the condensation of gas-phase ammonia (NH3) and nitric acid (HNO3). Additional studies in several western basins, including the SLV, have suggested that production of HNO3 from nocturnal heterogeneous N2O5 uptake is the dominant source of NH4NO3 during winter. The rate of this process, however, remains poorly quantified, in part due to limited vertical measurements above the surface, where this chemistry is most active. The 2017 Utah Winter Fine Particulate Study (UWFPS) provided the first aircraft measurements of detailed chemical composition during wintertime pollution events in the SLV. Coupled with ground-based observations, analyses of day- and nighttime research flights confirm that PM2.5 during wintertime pollution events is principally composed of NH4NO3, limited by HNO3. Here, observations and box model analyses assess the contribution of N2O5 uptake to nitrate aerosol during pollution events using the NO3- production rate, N2O5 heterogeneous uptake coefficient (gamma(N2O5)), and production yield of ClNO2 (phi(ClNO2)), which had medians of 1.6 mu g m(-3) h(-1), 0.076, and 0.220, respectively. While fit values of gamma(N2O5) may be biased high by a potential under-measurement in aerosol surface area, other fit quantities are unaffected. Lastly, additional model simulations suggest nocturnal N2O5 uptake produces between 2.4 and 3.9 mu g m(-3) of nitrate per day when considering the possible effects of dilution. This nocturnal production is sufficient to account for 52 %-85 % of the daily observed surface-level buildup of aerosol nitrate, though accurate quantification is dependent on modeled dilution, mixing processes, and photochemistry.

Eleven daytime hydroacoustic surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012 enabled length-frequency spectra of fish communities to be calculated within LdB. Fish echoes tracked and converted to length (>5 cm) formed size spectra with significant linear regressions in all cases (p values < 0.05, R-2 values from 0.87 to 0.99). Fish abundance (spectral height) was greater in 2011 (mean +/- SD = 0.19 +/- 0.15) than in 2012 (-0.19 +/- 0.20), decreasing through the summer sampling season. Both abundance and size composition (spectral slope) of fish communities differed between three basins of varying bathymetry, with steepest slopes and lowest heights associated with the shallowest waters. We conclude that acoustically derived size spectra provide an efficient means to detect and monitor fish community dynamics over varied spatial and temporal scales in aquatic ecosystems where fish are not highly aggregated and hence single acoustic targets predominate.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2016	73	4					557	564		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0446													WOS:000375424700009

However, the causes and mechanisms of these extended events are still unknown. Here, we present a climate modeling experiment that explores the oceanic drivers and atmospheric mechanisms conducive to long-term precipitation variability in the southern Altiplano (18-25 degrees S; 70-65 W; >3500 masl). We performed a series of 100-year-long idealized simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, configured to repeat annually the oceanic and atmospheric forcing leading to the exceptionally humid austral summers of 1983/1984 and 2011/2012. The aim of these cyclical experiments was to evaluate if these specific conditions can sustain a century-long pluvial event in the Altiplano. Unlike the annual forcing, long-term negative precipitation trends are observed in the simulations, suggesting that the drivers of 1983/1984 and 2011/2012 wet summers are unable to generate a century-scale pluvial event. Our results show that an intensification of the anticyclonic circulation along with cold surface air anomalies in the southwestern Atlantic progressively reinforce the lower and upper troposphere features that prevent moisture transport towards the Altiplano. Prolonged drying is also observed under persistent La Ni & ntilde;a conditions, which contradicts the well-known relationship between precipitation and ENSO at interannual timescales. Contrasting the hydroclimate responses between the Altiplano and the tropical Andes result from a sustained northward migration of the Atlantic trade winds, providing a useful analog for explaining the divergences in the Holocene records. This experiment suggests that the drivers of century-scale hydroclimate events in the Altiplano were more diverse than previously thought and shows how climate modeling can be used to test paleoclimate hypotheses, emphasizing the necessity of combining proxy data and numerical models to improve our understanding of past climates.					astudillo, orlando/NOF-9088-2025															2073-4433				JUN 20	2025	16	7							751	10.3390/atmos16070751	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16070751													WOS:001544037000001

Falls in the lake outlet formed a barrier to natural ascent of anadromous fish until construction of a fishpass in 1962. Accounts of successful introduction and development of viable and self-sustaining runs of salmon where none previously existed and the lake was inaccessible are scarce in the history of salmon fisheries on the Pacific Coast. The 1st sockeye returning to Frazer Lake in 1956 were produced from egg plants in 1951. Annual sockeye returns have progressively increased over a 28 yr period reaching record passage of 141,981 in 1978. Sockeye spawning has extended into new areas as returns increased. Spawning area capacity is projected to be sufficient for 365,000 sockeye while rearing area is estimated to be sufficient to support fry production from 400,000 sockeye. Sockeye returns per spawner have averaged 3.2 for 6 parent years (1966-1971) in which returns are complete. A chinook run was created from plants of 160,000 fry over a 4 yr period beginning in 1966. Chinook have returned to spawn in specific sites of fry release above the falls and in the lower river.																									1979	36	10					1265	1277		10.1139/f79-181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f79-181													WOS:A1979HQ54700014

During 23.6 h of tracking in February 2003, we recorded 100 locations of 12 radio-tagged terns. Birds were located within a range of 165 km from the tagging area, and most locations were at sea (74 at sea vs. 26 roosting on the beach), due to frequent movement of the birds when feeding and most tracking during feeding periods. Each bird was located 4-14 times (mean = 8.3 locations/bird). Common Terns fed predominantly between 15-20 m isobaths (56% of at sea locations), and 10-15 m isobaths (32%), which corresponded to a maximum of 8 km offshore. Minimum distance traveled in five days of intensive tracking was 46 km, and maximum distance was 167 km. Daily movement was 19 km on average (minimum 6 kin d(-1), maximum 49 km d(-1)). Nine out of 12 birds were found at sea in both early morning and late afternoon periods. Eight out of 12 birds were recorded feeding at sea in consecutive periods of the day (morning and afternoon), indicating two feeding trips a day.

However, thermophilic isolates remain largely unrecovered from their habitats and are rarely systematically identified. In this study, we characterized using polyphasic approaches a thermophilic strain, PKUAC-SCTAE412 (E412 hereafter), recovered from Lotus Lake hot spring based in Ganzi prefecture, China. The results of 16S rRNA/16S-23S ITS phylogenies, secondary structure, and morphology comparison strongly supported that strain E412 represent a novel genus within Leptolyngbyaceae. This delineation was further confirmed by genome-based analyses [phylogenomic inference, average nucleotide/amino-acid identity, and the percentages of conserved proteins (POCP)]. Based on the botanical code, the isolate is herein delineated as Leptothermofonsia sichuanensis gen. sp. nov, a genus adjacent to recently delineated Kovacikia and Stenomitos. In addition, we successfully obtained the first complete genome of this new genus. Genomic analysis revealed its adaptations to the adverse hot spring environment and extensive molecular components related to mobile genetic elements, photosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism. Moreover, the strain was capable of modifying the composition of its light-harvesting apparatus depending on the wavelength and photoperiod, showing chromatic adaptation capacity characteristic for T1 and T2 pigmentation types. Other physiological studies showed the strain's ability to utilize sodium bicarbonate and various sulfur compounds. The strain was also shown to be diazotrophic. Interestingly, 24.6% of annotated protein-coding genes in the E412 genome were identified as putatively acquired, hypothesizing that a large number of genes acquired through HGT might contribute to the genome expansion and habitat adaptation of those thermophilic strains. Most the HGT candidates (69.4%) were categorized as metabolic functions as suggested by the KEGG analysis. Overall, the complete genome of strain E412 provides the first insight into the genomic feature of the genus Leptothermofonsia and lays the foundation for future global ecogenomic and geogenomic studies.

A homogeneity test in CAPE data using the Wilcoxon-rank-sum test showed that statistically significant change points mainly occurred between 2000 and 2003 probably due to changes in humidity sensors during this period. Therefore, the trend analysis was split into two categories: 1979-2013 for regions where no statistically significant change points in CAPE were detected and 1979-2001 and 2002-2013 for regions where statistically significant change points in CAPE were detected. The results show that increasing trends in CAPE and extreme precipitation indices dominate the eastern Atlantic coast of the US and some parts of the Great Lakes. Mixed increasing and decreasing trends were detected in the US mid-west while the western US and the Canadian Pacific coast had little trend in CAPE and extreme precipitation indices. Although both increasing and decreasing trends were detected, the average trends in RX1day and RX5day were about 0.2 mm/decade and 0.5 mm/decade over 1979-2013. However, the average trend for the 1979-2001 period was 0.2 mm/decade (RX1day) and 1.2 mm/decade (RX5day) as compared 1.2 mm/decade (RX1day) and 1.7 mm/decade (RX5day) for the 2002-2013 period. Temperatures also increased more during the 2002-2013 period (0.3 degrees C/decade) as compared to the 1979-2001 period (0.1 degrees C/decade). The higher increasing trend of the recent decades suggests that increasing temperatures could potentially lead to an overall increase in CAPE and extreme precipitation over the US and southern Canada.																			1474-7065	1873-5193				OCT	2021	123								103047	10.1016/j.pce.2021.103047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2021.103047		JUL 2021											WOS:000685195200001

Altaf			Comparison of tree-ring growth and eddy covariance-based ecosystem productivities in three different-aged pine plantation forests	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Key message This study utilized dendrochronology and long-term (2003-2017) eddy covariance (EC) carbon flux data to investigate the relationships between tree growth and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP(EC)) in different-age (15-, 42- and 78-year old) pine plantation forests in the Great Lakes region in eastern North America and found that tree-ring growth in these different-age pine forests was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with observed annual GEP(EC) values. Forests play a major role in the global carbon cycle. Understanding the dynamics of the forest carbon cycle and its driving factors is challenging. This study utilized dendrochronology and long-term (2003-2017) eddy covariance (EC) carbon flux data to investigate the relationships between tree growth and gross and net ecosystem productivities (GEP(EC) and NEPEC) in different-age (15-, 42- and 78-year old) pine plantation forests in the Great Lakes region in eastern North America. Tree growth in these different-age pine forests was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with observed annual GEP(EC) values, while coherence between tree growth and NEPEC was relatively poor. Current-year and 1-year lagged ring-width chronologies and climate variables, including spring (April-May) temperature (T-SPR) and Standardized Potential Evapotranspiration Index (SPEISUM) over the summer months (June-August) were used to test ten different linear regression models to simulate tree-ring-based GEP (GEP(TR)) values at all three sites. This analysis showed that current-year growth was the best predictor of GEP(TR) at all three sites, when compared to observed GEP(EC,) except during drought years, when GEP(TR) was underestimated. Current-year tree growth models were then used to reconstruct GEP(TR) over the life span of each stand. These reconstructions showed low GEP(TR) values from 1978 to 1988 and from 2002 to 2007. Low GEP(TR) in late 1970s occurred in response to below average temperatures when there were no major drought periods, while low GEP(TR) in early 2000s occurred following drought-like conditions in 2002. However, in recent years relatively higher GEP(TR) was observed at all three different-age forest sites. This interdisciplinary study will help to improve our understanding of carbon exchanges and the key environmental controls and associated uncertainties on tree growth in these different-age plantation stands in eastern North America. It will also help to determine how these forests may respond to climate change.					Arain, M./ABA-9750-2020	Arain, M.

The "static chamber" method was deployed at five or six stations located along the reservoirs, where the water column at its deepest slightly exceeds 2 m. Obtained values for the fluxes of CH4 varied across a wide (0-2513.48 mmol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)) range, with many of these values therefore exceeding those characteristics for large tropical reservoirs. The reservoirs studied were not found to differ significantly in terms of average CH4 flux, however. Where obtained values for CO2 fluxes in the range from -10.96 to 621.69 mmol center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) were concerned, most fell within the range given for temperate-zone reservoirs, while differences between reservoirs were noted for average values in this case.

Eared grebe diet on Great Salt Lake, Utah, and competition with the commercial harvest of brine shrimp cysts	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Interactions between wildlife and commercial harvest industries need to be understood to manage resources for all users. About 1.5 million eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), half the North American population, stage on Utah's Great Salt Lake (GSL) each fall. A $56 million commercial harvest industry also operates during fall when the harvest of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) cysts occurs. Eared grebes and commercial harvest both utilize brine shrimp cysts creating a potentially adverse relationship. We assessed the diet of eared grebes to determine the extent to which they are dependent on brine shrimp and their cysts. We collected individual birds to measure diets and examine changes in body condition of staging eared grebes. Cysts were consumed by 40% of collected eared grebes and made up >75% of aggregate biomass of stomach samples. Despite the high occurrence of cysts in stomach samples, cysts were not the primary food item of eared grebes. Cysts were held in the stomach for longer periods by feather mass, so esophagus samples were a better indicator of diet. Adult brine shrimp were the primary food collected from the esophagus from October until December. After cold water temperatures caused a die-off of adult brine shrimp, cysts became more prevalent in the diet of eared grebes. Concomitantly, eared grebe body weights decreased as their diet shifted to brine shrimp cysts. Current monitoring and management of commercial harvest are sufficient to maintain yearly populations of adult brine shrimp to sustain eared grebes populations.

We discovered a copulating compression fossil of the sciarid flies from the Pleistocene Shiobara Group, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, which is briefly described herein. The specimen represents one of the rare examples of a compression fossil showing mating dipteran insects. This finding implies that the small bodies of sciarid flies which readily fall onto the water surface may have contributed to the preservation of our copulating fossil. Moreover, the depositional environment of the paleo-Shiobara Lake was the main factor that served to preserve this specimen.

J	Werner, P; Smol, JP				Werner, P; Smol, JP			Diatom-environmental relationships and nutrient transfer functions from contrasting shallow and deep limestone lakes in Ontario, Canada	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatom assemblages were analysed in the surface sediments of 44 alkaline lakes in south-western Ontario, Canada, and combined with a pre-existing 58 south-eastern Ontario lake set: (1) to determine if shallow, polymictic Ontario lakes contain different diatom assemblages from deeper, dimictic lakes, and if so, which environmental variables most influence assemblages; (2) to improve the existing transfer functions; (3) to construct and compare transfer functions separately for dimictic, deep lakes and for polymictic, shallow lakes. Polymictic and dimictic lakes covered a similar nutrient range (spring total phosphorus (TP) = 454 mug/l, spring total nitrogen (TN) = 200-927 mug/l; n = 101) and spring pH levels (7.6-9; n = 101). However, polymictic lakes were shallower (median mean depth = 2.9 in vs. 7.3 in in dimictic lakes). Benthic diatoms (average 60% relative abundance) dominated the polymictic lakes, whereas planktonic diatoms (average 60%) dominated dimictic lakes. A Canonical Correspondence Analyses with forward selection (p < 0.05, 999 Monte Carlo permutations) identified TP, alkalinity, watershed to volume ratios and lake depth as the most important measured environmental variables influencing diatom distribution in both polymictic and dimictic lakes. Additionally, pH was identified as an important variable in polymictic lakes. whereas TN was also forward selected in the dimictic lakes. Adding more lakes to the original southern Ontario calibration set improved the TN transfer function (r(jack)(2) = 0.42, root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP)jak = 0- 11 [log ug TN/l]), although there was a high systematic error in the revised model 0.48). However, the strongest TP model was derived from the polymictic lakes bo t = 0.44, RMSEPboet = 0.20 [log ug TP/l]), which was the smallest lake set (n = 30) with the lowest number of diatom species. The stronger TP model from the polymictic lakes may be partly due to the relatively low macrophyte cover in our polymictic lakes, which may lead to stronger benthic pelagic coupling than in lakes with large macrophyte populations. Additionally, our study suggests that the Chrysophyceae cyst:diatom frustule ratio may be useful for indicating trends in TP levels of less than or equal to35 mug/l in alkaline lakes that are dimictic, but is not necessarily indicative of trophic state changes in shallow, polymictic lakes. Our study demonstrates that it may be important to construct separate diatom-based nutrient transfer functions for polymictic and dimictic lakes.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Werner, Petra/0000-0003-1418-4560													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 15	2005	533						145	173		10.1007/s10750-004-2409-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-2409-6													WOS:000226928900013

The long-term effects of azoxystrobin were evaluated on several structural (phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrate populations and communities) and functional (microbial decomposition, macrophyte and periphyton growth) parameters making use of freshwater mesocosms. Azoxystrobin was applied in two pulses of 2, 20, 200 mu g/L separated by 14 d using the commercial product ORTIVA (23 % azoxystrobin w/w). The results show that these two habitats responded differently to the fungicide application due to their distinct physico-chemical, functional, and structural characteristics. Although overall sensitivity was found to be similar between the two (lowest NOEC < 2 mu g/L), the taxa and processes that were affected differed substantially. In general, the most sensitive species to the fungicide were found in the water spring mesocosms, with some species of phytoplankton (Nitzschia sp.) or macrocrustaceans (Echinogammarus sp. and Dugastella valentina) being significantly affected at 2 mu g/L. In the eutrophic lake mesocosms, effects were found on phytoplankton taxa (Desmodesmus sp. and Coelastrum sp.), on numerous zooplankton taxa, on chironomids and on the beetle Colymbetes fuscus, although at higher concentrations. The hemipteran Micronecta scholtzi was affected in both treatments. In addition, functional parameters such as organic matter decomposition or macrophyte growth were also affected at relatively low concentrations (NOEC 2 mu g/L). Structural Equation Modelling was used to shed light on the indirect effects caused by azoxystrobin on the ecosystem. These results show that azoxystrobin is likely to pose structural and functional effects on Mediterranean wetland ecosystems at environmentally relevant concentrations. Moreover, it highlights the need to consider habitat-specific features when conducting ecotoxicological research at the population and community levels.					; Navarro Pacheco, Natividad Isabel/P-9952-2018; Vega, Constanza/LXB-6109-2024; Rico, Andreu/G-1102-2016; Crettaz, Melina/MIN-4826-2025	Crettaz Minaglia, Melina Celeste/0000-0003-4714-803X; Navarro Pacheco, Natividad Isabel/0000-0001-9064-0666; Amador, Pablo/0000-0002-3793-8794; Rico, Andreu/0000-0002-1820-4218; Vega Olivares, Constanza/0000-0001-5679-0687; 													0166-445X	1879-1514				FEB	2024	267								106828	10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106828		JAN 2024						38176168					WOS:001154873200001

This study reports new results of gas chemistry and isotopes (O, H, N, C, and He) of thermal spring samples (T = 36.8-83.5 degrees C; pH = 8.5-10.3) from the Magadi and Natron basin (MNB) in the East African Rift (EAR). Although a number of thermal springs are shown to ascend along normal faults and feed into major lakes (Magadi, Little Magadi, and Natron), volatile sources and fluxes of these fluids are poorly constrained. CO2 is the most abundant phase (up to 996,325 mmol/mol), and the N-2-He-Ar abundances show a mixture of dissolved gases from deep (mantle-derived) and shallow (air/air saturated water) sources. The H-2-Ar-CH4-CO2 geothermometers indicate that equilibrium temperatures range from similar to 100 to similar to 150 degrees C.delta O-18 (-4.4 to -0.2%.) and delta D (-28.9 to -3.9%.) values of the MNB thermal waters still lie slightly to the right of the local meteoric water lines, reflecting minor evaporation. Each mixing relationship of N-2 (delta N-15 = -1.5 to 0.4 parts per thousand.; N-2/He-3 = 3.92 x 10(6)-1.33 x 10(9), except for an anomalous biogenic sample (delta N-18 = 5.9%.)) and CO2 (delta C-13 = -5.7 to 1.6 parts per thousand; CO2/He-3 = 7.24 x 10(8)-1.81 x 10(11)) suggests that the predominant mantle component of the MNB volatiles is Subcontinental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM). However, N-2 is mostly atmospheric, and minor CO2 is contributed by the limestone end-member. He-3/He-4 ratios (0.64-4.00 Ra) also indicate a contribution of SCLM (R/Ra = 6.1 +/- 0.9), with radiogenic He-4 derived from a crustal source (R/Ra = 0.02). The MNB He-4 flux rates (3.64 x 10(11) to 3.34 x 10(14) atoms/m(2) s) are significantly greater than the reported mean of global continental flux values (4.18 x 10(16) atoms/m(2) s), implying that magma intrusions could supply mantle He-4, and related heating and fracturing release crustal He-4 from the Tanzanian craton and Mozambique belt. Total flux values (mol/yr) of He-3, N-2, and CO2 are 8.18, 4.07 x 10(7), and 5.31 x 10(9), which are 1.28%, 2.04%, and 0.24% of global fluxes, respectively. Our results suggest that the primary source of magmatic volatiles in the MNB is SCLM, with additional crustal contributions, which is different from the KRV volatiles that have more asthenospheric mantle components. Volatiles from SCLM in magmas stall in the crust to heat and fracture country rock, with accompanying crustal volatile release.

In this paper, the submerged area and dynamic changes of flooding area was monitored using 250m-resolution MODIS images from 2000-2010. Results indicate that the inundated area of the Poyang Lake in 2010 is larger than any other years. The inundated area rose up between 2000 and 2010 for the Poyang Lake, while the inundated area of the east Dongting Lake and the southwest Dongting Lake showed a clear downward trend. The longest duration of fluctuation is up to 5-6 months for the three lakes. Summer is the season with higher frequency of flooding. The submerged depth of three Lakes concentrated in 0-10m which accounts for more than 70%. During 2000-2010, the loss of land area gradually declined, however, the number of affected population has a upward trend.																			2153-6996		978-1-4577-1005-6				2011							807	810		10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049253													WOS:000297496300194
J	Saarinen, M; Taskinen, J				Saarinen, M; Taskinen, J			Burrowing and crawling behaviour of three species of unionidae in Finland	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												The aim of this study was to examine the burrowing and crawling behaviour of three unionid clam species in the field. Of the four study lakes in southern Finland, Anodonta piscinalis occurred in all, Pseudanodonta complanata in three and Unio pictorum in only one. In all three species, there was a positive correlation between the height of the above-sediment part of the shell and the burrowing angle (deviation from the horizontal position). When surfacing, the position of the clam became more vertical. Anodonta piscinalis was more visible in June than in August in one population, while in other populations monthly differences were not found. The result suggests that A. piscinalis may be more visible during its spawning period in early summer (June) than in late summer. This behaviour could have a reproductive function, ensuring external fertilization. Monthly differences in crawling activity of A. piscinalis were also found in one population: in Lake Alvajarvi, A. piscinalis crawled more in August than in June. No monthly differences in the burrowing or crawling of P. complanata were found. In Unio pictorum, no differences were observed in crawling, but the clams were more visible in August than in June. When compared with P. complanata, A. piscinalis and U. pictorum were more visible and in a more vertical position. In A. piscinalis, the bigger individuals were more visible than the smaller individuals, but this was not the case in P. complanata and U. pictorum.

The study period extends from the onset of thermal stratification in the spring until midsummer in 2005. During this time, wind forcing was periodic, with a period of 24 h (typical of land-sea breezes), and the thermal structure in the lake was characterized by the presence of a shallow surface layer overlying a thick metalimnion, typical of small to medium sized reservoirs with deep outtakes. Basin-scale internal seiches of high vertical mode (ranging from mode V3 to V5) were observed in the metalimnion. The structure of the dominant modes of oscillation changed as stratification evolved on seasonal timescales, but in all cases, their periods were close to that of the local wind forcing (i.e., 24 h), suggesting a resonant response. Nonresonant oscillatory modes of type V1 and V2 became dominant after large frontal events, which disrupted the diurnal periodicity of the wind forcing.

Willow Warbler and Garden Warbler occurred mainly on passage, with peak values in the first lunar quarter, the period in which lakeflies would normally swarm. Higher warbler densities have been reported from the north-western shores. This agrees with our idea that the prevailing eastern winds will result in a higher availability of lakeflies to warblers at the western side of the lake.																			0030-6525					MAR	2000	71	1-2					210	212		10.1080/00306525.2000.9639913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.2000.9639913													WOS:000088246100052

This constitutes a critical but poorly quantified feedback, primarily due to the limited observational capacity and an incomplete understanding of the bottom ablation processes within SGLs. In this study, we improved the SGL model GlacierLake_v2 by incorporating a specific albedo-depth parameterization developed from Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 observations and a meteorologically driven runoff module to account for meltwater input. Validating against in-situ observation suggests the GlacierLake_v2 shows promising performance in SGL bottom ablation estimation, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2 cm. Our simulations reveal that the SGL-albedo feedback has increased the summer ice melt rate by 122 % in Lake BlueSnow, and the feedback decreases exponentially with lake depth. Additionally, the presence of SGLs mitigates the temporary reduction in ice melt rates typically induced by summer snowfall. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating SGL-albedo feedback in the Greenland ice sheet hydrological and mass balance modeling in a warming Arctic.					sun, weijun/GZB-2595-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	662		B						134001	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134001													WOS:001547679900001

Few studies have investigated the sensitivity of D. brachyurum to toxic chemicals despite this species often being dominant in natural lakes and ponds. We performed acute toxicity tests of three heavy metals, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd), to D. brachyurum. For D. brachyurum, the lethal concentration (LC)(50) values of Cu (24-h LC50 = 16.4 mu g/L, 48-h LC50 = 10.4 mu g/L) and Zn (24-h LC50 = 253.4 mu g/L, 48-h LC50 = 174.1 mu g/L) were lower than those for D. magna, one of the most used test organisms for toxic chemicals. On the other hand, for D. brachyurum the 24-h LC50 of Cd (166.4 mu g/L) was much greater than that for D. magna, and the 48-h LC50 of Cd (69.8 mu g/L) was comparable. Our results indicate that D. brachyurum may be more strongly influenced by Zn and Cu than is D. magna. It is likely that the summer plankton community in which Diaphanosoma species is dominant is more sensitive to heavy metals than a community in which Daphnia species are dominant.

Wintering Swan Geese maximize energy intake through substrate foraging depth when feeding on buried Vallisneria natans tubers	AVIAN RESEARCH												BackgroundForaging theory predicts that animals select patches that offer the highest net rate of energy gain. Hence, prey distribution patterns and spatiotemporal heterogeneity play important roles in determining animal feeding patch selection. For waterfowl foraging on buried aquatic plant tubers, the distribution and biomass of these plant organs vary with depth in the substrate. Since excavation costs also increase with depth, the energy intake of the animals foraging on these plants is highly sediment depth dependent.MethodsHere, using observations of Swan Geese (Anser cygnoides) foraging on Vallisneria natans tubers, we test our hypothesis that geese feeding on tubers buried at intermediate sediment depth maximize their daily energy intake because of the interaction between tuber size and abundance with depth. To do this, we measured the distribution patterns of buried Vallisneria tubers under both undisturbed conditions and post-exploitation by geese (i.e. giving-up conditions). We investigated the relationship between tuber size and burial depth, and total tuber biomass within each sediment layer in undisturbed and exploited plots. Finally, we compared modelled Swan Goose daily energy intake feeding on Vallisneria tubers buried at different sediment layers (1-10, 11-20 and 21-30cm below the surface).ResultsDry weight of Vallisneria tubers linearly increased with burial depth, while average total dry weight density of tubers showed a unimodal relationship, peaking at intermediate levels. Not surprisingly, Swan Geese foraged most intensively on tubers buried at intermediate sediment depths, where they maximize their daily energy intake. Our results support our hypothesis that Swan Geese feeding on tubers at intermediate depths maximize their daily energy intake.ConclusionsOur study is the first to quantify foraging strategies of Swan Geese during the wintering period, emphasizing the importance of plant traits on foraging selection of belowground foragers.

A total of 12 mayfly taxa were recorded. Almost half of the collected specimens belonged to the genus Baetis Leach, 1815, which was recorded at every site, but we were unable to distinguish between two included species (B. rhodani and B. cf. nubecularis). Other abundant species were Centroptilum luteolum (Muller, 1776), Alainites muticus (Linnaeus, 1758), Habrophlebia lauta Eaton 1884, Paraleptophlebia submarginata (Stephens, 1835), Serratella ignita (Poda, 1761), Ephemera danica Muller, 1764 and Rhithrogena braaschi Jacob, 1974. The mayfly assemblages at all sites were dominated by species typical of the rhithral zone, but there was a shift in species composition along a longitudinal gradient (from 720 to 390 m a.s.l.) from dominance of eucrenal-epirhithral to metarhithral-hyporhithral elements and finally to appearance of metapotamal and littoral elements. Two environmental factors, maximum water temperature and mean pH, had the highest influence on the mayfly assemblages. Emergence mainly occurred between March and November and was related to the elevated water temperature. Emergence patterns of some species were in accordance with their typical Central European emergence patterns (e.g. S. ignita, H. lauta) while some others showed certain discrepancies (e.g. longer emergence period in Rh. braaschi and P. submarginata, one generation emergence in A. muticus and variable emergence patterns between the sites and between the two studied years in C. luteolum). The current study provides a significant contribution to the knowledge of mayfly ecology in karst freshwater habitats which forms a basis for further investigation and monitoring of mayflies in this area.

However, investigating flood events in urbanized plains is challenging as anthropogenic behaviors can change river flow without rainfall. In addition, while the frequency and magnitude of floods have been well examined, knowledge about variations in the rate of flood change is still limited. To fill these gaps, we proposed a scheme that focused on flood responses to rainfall to detect changes in flood characteristics in the Central Taihu Basin, a highly urbanized region in the Yangtze River Delta of China. Four characteristic metrics were adopted to summarize the flood hydrograph, including the peak, increment, rising rate, and falling rate. We then examined trends of these metrics based on the selected rainfall-flood events from ten hydrological stations during 1970-2020. Subsequently, the reduction method was used to separate the impacts of regional climate change and human activities on flood characteristics alterations. Furthermore, the importance of fifteen factors was quantified by the random forest model. We found that there is a significant upward trend in the evolution of flood characteristics, except for the increment of floods. Flood characteristics exhibit higher values when rainfall accumulates, indicating stronger responses of floods to a large amount of rainfall. The results also show that human activities dominate and impact the peak, rising rate, and falling rate of floods more than climate change. Meanwhile, although cumulative precipitation is the most important factor, flood characteristics are also susceptible to anthropogenic factors, such as land use change and hydraulic engineering construction. Our findings, which provide insights into flood event identification and enhance the understanding of regional flood changes, will serve as a reference for water resource management and flood mitigation in urbanized areas.

J	Pollentier, CD; Hull, SD; MacFarland, DM				Pollentier, Christopher; Hull, Scott; MacFarland, David			Sensitivity of multiple vital rates for Ruffed Grouse in the Upper Great Lakes Region	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Effective management of wildlife requires a full understanding of population dynamics and knowledge of potential drivers that influence population growth. The Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) is a popular upland game bird widely distributed across the northern United States and Canada that has experienced population declines within portions of its range in response to forest maturation and habitat loss. Although the species has been extensively studied, few efforts have been made to synthesize demographic data into a sensitivity analysis to guide management actions. We reviewed the literature and compiled Ruffed Grouse vital rates from 14 field studies conducted across four decades (1982-2018) within the Upper Great Lakes region of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, USA. We parameterized a deterministic matrix model to evaluate population dynamics and conducted sensitivity analyses to identify vital rates projected to have the greatest influence on the finite rate of population change (lambda). Our modeling effort projected a stable but highly variable annual rate of population change (lambda = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.88-1.14) for Ruffed Grouse in the Upper Great Lakes region. Stochastic rates of population change derived from spring drumming surveys (lambda = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.61-1.45) and Christmas Bird Count surveys (lambda = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.62-1.76) of the corresponding regional population provided validation of stable trends over the same time period as our demographic model. Prospective elasticities and variance-scaled sensitivities suggested lambda would be greatly influenced by components of reproductive performance: nesting success, chick survival, and post-fledging juvenile survival. Retrospective analysis indicated that much of the overall variability in lambda and annual productivity was also attributed to annual variation in nesting success. Management of this species has often focused on fall and overwinter survival, but population projection models provided little evidence that survival was the predominant factor affecting population growth of Ruffed Grouse in this region. A suite of confounding factors and demographic processes that drive population trends can differ significantly across a species' range. In the Upper Great Lakes region, management efforts aimed at maximizing reproductive success would likely have the greatest potential influence on Ruffed Grouse population growth. Other types of systematic, regional survey data can also be useful for validating population trends derived from demographic modeling studies.

Given the potential health consequences associated with swimming in contaminated water, health officials have made more effort in recent years to ensure that information about beach advisories is available through the media and other sources. A recent survey of over 800 single-day beach visitors during the summer of 1998 found that nearly two thirds of visitors take advantage of this information when making decisions about their beach trips. When accounting for this information in a travel cost model, we find that the average (across all visitors) seasonal benefits of reducing one advisory is approximately $28 per visitor. Individuals who use the media in advance of trips gain less, approximately $24 per year, while those who use only signs posted at the beach would gain more, $38 per year.

Even though archaeology and history provide substantial information about their past, their biological origin and the demographic consequences of their settlement in the Central Valley of Mexico remain unsolved. Two main hypotheses compete to explain the Mexica origin: a social reorganization of the groups already present in the Central Valley after the fall of the Classic centres or a population replacement of the Mesoamerican groups by migrants from the north and the consequent setting up of the Mexica society. Here, we show that the main changes in the facial phenotype occur during the Classic-Postclassic transition, rather than in the rise of the Mexica. Furthermore, Mexica facial morphology seems to be already present in the early phases of the Postclassic epoch and is not related to the northern facial pattern. A combination of geometric morphometrics with Relethford-Blangero analyses of within-versus among-group variation indicates that Postclassic groups are more variable than expected. This result suggests that intense gene exchange was likely after the fall of the Classic and maybe responsible for the Postclassic facial phenotype. The source population for the Postclassic groups could be located somewhere in western Mesoamerica, since North Mexico and Central Mesoamerican Preclassic and Classic groups are clearly divergent from the Postclassic ones. Similarity among Preclassic and Classic groups and those from Aridoamerica could be reflecting the ancestral phenotypic pattern characteristic of the groups that first settled Mesoamerica.

J	NEDWELL, DB; WATSON, A				NEDWELL, DB; WATSON, A			CH4 PRODUCTION, OXIDATION AND EMISSION IN A UK OMBROTROPHIC PEAT BOG - INFLUENCE OF SO42- FROM ACID-RAIN	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Factors influencing the rates of production and emission of CH4, CH4 oxidation and rates of SO42- reduction, were measured in the peat of an ombrotrophic bog in New Galloway, Scotland. Vertical concentration profiles of CH4 and O-2 showed that the water table essentially represented the oxic-anoxic boundary in the peat. This boundary was usually at the surface in the case of peat-bog hollows, but up to 20 cm of oxic peat occurred above the water table in peat-bog hummocks. Penetration of O-2 into the peat increased under illumination when photosynthesis was active, but decreased in the dark. Emission of CH4 from the pear surface was faster from peat-bog hollows than from hummocks, where most CH4 was reoxidized before emission. CH4 emission rates also varied seasonally, being greatest during summer. For most of the year the amount of organic C oxidized to CO2 by SO42- reduction by anaerobic bacteria exceeded that being transformed to CH4 by methanogenic bacteria, except during summer when SO42- reduction became SO42- limited. Laboratory experiments showed that the addition of SO42- to peat inhibited CH4 formation, confirming that there was competitive inhibition of CH4 formation by active SO42- reduction, as demonstrated in other environments. The degree of acid rain deposition of SO42- onto peat bogs may therefore be extremely important in regulating the production and emission of CH4 from peat. CH4 formation was most active in the strata of peat 5-15 cm below the water table, although actual rates of CH4 formation were slower in the peat beneath hummocks than that below hollows. In contrast, CH4 oxidation occurred nearer the peat surface (only 3-7 cm below the water table) where the methanotrophic bacteria could intercept vertically migrating CH4. Surprisingly, the peak for CH4 oxidation potential occurred at about 5 cm below the water table, in peat which was apparently anoxic. This may reflect either a transiently oxic peat environment, in which aerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria persisted, or the presence of a community of facultatively anaerobic CH4-oxidizing bacteria which, in anoxic conditions, metabolized substrates other than CH4. There was no evidence of anaerobic CH4 oxidation.																			0038-0717					JUL	1995	27	7					893	903		10.1016/0038-0717(95)00018-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(95)00018-A													WOS:A1995RB08300004
J	JUNNILA, RM; YOUNG, GM				JUNNILA, RM; YOUNG, GM			THE PALEOPROTEROZOIC UPPER GOWGANDA FORMATION, WHITEFISH-FALLS AREA, ONTARIO, CANADA - SUBAQUEOUS DEPOSITS OF A BRAID DELTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The upper Gowganda Formation is part of the Paleoproterozoic Huronian Supergroup (ca. 2.5-2.2 Ga) of the north shore of Lake Huron. The upper Gowganda Formation rests with sharp conformable contact on glaciogenic rocks of the lower Gowganda Formation and is gradational with cross-bedded sandstones of the overlying Lorrain Formation. At the southern margin of the Huronian fold belt, in the Whitefish Falls area, the upper Gowganda Formation is 380-750 m thick, and consists of four coarsening-upward cycles from 30 to 300 m in thickness. Each is comprised of the succession (a) laminated argillite deposited from suspension on the prodelta, (b) argillite and cross-laminated sandstone laid down on the delta front by normal fluvial input and flood episodes, (c) fine- to coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstone formed as distributary-mouth sand sheets influenced by shallow marine processes. Abundant soft-sediment deformation indicates rapid sedimentation and (or) contemporaneous fault-related seismicity. Erosional contacts between cycles resulted from marine reworking as sediment supply diminished. Each coarsening-upward cycle is interpreted as the subaqueous deposits of a braid delta that prograded into a moderately wave-influenced, tectonically active marine basin. In some respects, the succession of the deltaic deposits is comparable to those formed during the postglacial evolution of the Mississippi delta, but it is likely that the fluvial regime at the time of deposition of the Gowganda Formation was dominantly braided.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				FEB	1995	32	2					197	209		10.1139/e95-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-016													WOS:A1995QQ12600008

Recent water level changes across Earth's largest lake system and implications for future variability	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water levels on Lake Ontario, the most downstream of the Laurentian Great Lakes, reached a record high in the spring of 2017. This event was accompanied by widespread flooding and displacement of families. Water levels across all of the Great Lakes have risen over the past several years following a period of record low levels. When levels were low, public and expert discussion focused on the possibility that low levels would continue into the future due to climate change, diversions of water from the lakes, and dredging. During the current high water period, variability is being attributed to water management, despite evidence of unusually high precipitation and river flows across the region. Understanding and communicating the drivers behind water level variability, particularly in light of recent extremes, is a fundamental step towards improving regional water resources management and policy.

Methylation activity was only detected in the anoxic hypolimnia of lakes. The stable isotope was methylated at varying rates between lakes and depths within lakes ranging from 0.56%/day to 14.8%/day. A peak in methylation potential was typically observed just below the oxycline, which decreased with increasing depth. The depth and rates of methylation potential changed seasonally with no methylation activity occurring after fall turnover. A decrease in the sulfate concentration was concomitant with the zone of mercury methylation potential indicating the likely involvement of sulfate reducing bacteria in the methylation process. A simple correlation test between DOC concentrations and methylation rates indicated a positive relationship (r(2) =0.62; p=0.006; n=27). The demethylation rate constant in the anoxic hypolimnia was less than 0.12 d(-1).

Weak ISM intensity (1400-1150 cal yr BP) is indicated by low SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and high delta C-13, CaO, and CaO/MgO, with TOC/TN < 10. Strengthening ISM (1150-850 cal yr BP) aligns with the Medieval Warm Period, marked by increased sediment moisture, delta C-13, and TOC/TN > 10. A dry phase (850-650 cal yr BP) correlates with the Little Ice Age, showing low Al2O3 and Fe2O3, high CaO, CO3-2, and TOC/TN < 10. Increased precipitation (650-400 cal yr BP) shows the contribution of more soluble and mobile elements into the pond. From 400 cal yr BP-present is reflected by shifts in delta C-13, TOC/TN > 10, SiO2/Al2O3, and lower CaO/MgO shows less carbonate precipitation due to warm and humid climatic conditions.																			2662-5571	2447-9462				MAR	2025	10	1					129	141		10.1007/s43217-025-00217-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43217-025-00217-w		JAN 2025											WOS:001406035300001
J	GLOVER, BW; OBEIRNE, AM				GLOVER, BW; OBEIRNE, AM			ANATOMY, HYDRODYNAMICS AND DEPOSITIONAL SETTING OF A WESTPHALIAN-C LACUSTRINE DELTA COMPLEX, WEST-MIDLANDS, ENGLAND	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Studies, spanning a 3 year period, of Westphalian C strata exposed in an active quarry have enabled three dimensional reconstruction of a lacustrine delta complex. The sequence exhibits a complex history of lake infilling by sediment introduced by intermittent high energy, low sinuosity distributary channel flows. Deposition in the small 0-2 km2 lake prior to delta formation was dominated by organic matter and typified rheotrophic swamp conditions. Large lycopods colonized the swamp floor. The lake was filled by a prograding delta which comprised six horizontally and vertically stacked delta lobes. The presence of lycopods aided sediment accumulation. Fluctuations in river discharge and consequent lake level rise and fall exerted a fundamental control on delta progradation and aggradation. Flooding during low lake levels first produced erosion on the existing lobe followed by a lake level rise which created accommodation for aggradation of a new delta lobe. Further lobe erosion and low stand lobe formation occurred during lake level fall. The area's proximity to alluvial fans resulted in hyperconcentrated flood flow within the distributary channels. The occurrence upon in-channel surfaces of plant colonization, including lycopods, testifies to the ephemeral nature of the flow. The lacustrine delta complex formed at the front of a terminal alluvial fan. Northward progradation of the alluvial fan was achieved by the capture and infilling of lakes by northerly flowing distributary channels.																			0037-0746					FEB	1994	41	1					115	132		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01394.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01394.x													WOS:A1994MW58200006

We present a continuous geochemical record from the eastern Kimberley, Australia, which spans similar to 65 ka to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The record comes from the floodplain of the Bullo River, which is currently directly impacted by the IASM, and represents variations in the hydroclimate of its 2000 km(2) catchment. Results show that the hydroclimate during the glacial lacked the prolonged and high-amplitude changes that marked the hydroclimate following the LGM. Flooding was less frequent or of reduced magnitude than during the deglacial and early Holocene. While there was an absence of substantial long-term change, there is evidence of a subtle shift in mid Marine Isotope Stage 3 to less frequent or lower magnitude flooding and longer instances of dry conditions in the catchment. The low temporal resolution of these results means that centennial or shorter scale periods of enhanced IASM activity cannot be ruled out. These results extend our understanding of the long-term hydroclimate of monsoonal Australia during the glacial, which has, to date, largely been inferred from discontinuous geomorphic records.					; McGowan, Hamish/AAD-9607-2021; Moss, Patrick/AFM-9408-2022	Rudd, Rachel/0000-0003-1139-5805; Moss, Patrick/0000-0003-1546-9242													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 1	2025	667								112875	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112875		MAR 2025											WOS:001447080400001

We evaluated how cyanobacteria blooms, driven by agricultural eutrophication (in eutrophic Lake Koyliojarvi) or global warming (in mesotrophic Lake Pyhajarvi), influence the biomass and structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities. In terms of the nutritional value of food web components, we evaluated changes in the omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of phytoplankton and consumers at different trophic levels. Meanwhile, the lakes did not differ in their biomasses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities, lake trophic status greatly influenced the community structures. The eutrophic lake, with agricultural eutrophication, had cyanobacteria bloom throughout the summer months whereas cyanobacteria were abundant only occasionally in the mesotrophic lake, mainly in early summer. Phytoplankton community differences at genus level resulted in higher arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content of seston in the mesotrophic than in the eutrophic lake. This was also reflected in the EPA and DHA content of herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia and Bosmina) despite more efficient trophic retention of these biomolecules in a eutrophic lake than in the mesotrophic lake zooplankton. Planktivorous juvenile fish (perch and roach) in a eutrophic lake overcame the lower availability of DHA in their prey by more efficient trophic retention and biosynthesis from the precursors. However, the most efficient trophic retention of DHA was found with benthivorous perch which prey contained only a low amount of DHA. Long-term cyanobacterial blooming decreased the nutritional quality of piscivorous perch; however, the difference was much less than previously anticipated. Our result shows that long-term cyanobacteria blooming impacts the structure of plankton and fish communities and lowers the nutritional quality of seston and zooplankton, which, however, is mitigated at upper trophic levels.					; Litmanen, Jaakko/MYS-3796-2025; Taipale, Sami/HKE-2611-2023	Anttila, Lauri/0000-0002-4530-9912; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Litmanen, Jaakko/0000-0003-2828-3885; 													2045-7758					MAR	2022	12	3							e8687	10.1002/ece3.8687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8687								35342549					WOS:000774756900001

The distribution and evolution of supraglacial lakes on 79° N Glacier (north-eastern Greenland) and interannual climatic controls	CRYOSPHERE												The Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier (also known as the 79 degrees North Glacier) drains approximately 8% of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Supraglacial lakes (SGLs), or surface melt ponds, are a persistent summertime feature and are thought to drain rapidly to the base of the glacier and influence seasonal ice velocity. However, seasonal development and spatial distribution of SGLs in the north-east of Greenland are poorly understood, leaving a substantial error in the estimate of meltwater and its impacts on ice velocity. Using results from an automated detection of melt ponds, atmospheric and surface mass balance modelling, and reanalysis products, we investigate the role of specific climatic conditions in melt onset, extent, and duration from 2016 to 2019. The summers of 2016 and 2019 were characterised by above-average air temperatures, particularly in June, as well as a number of rainfall events, which led to extensive melt ponds to elevations up to 1600 m. Conversely, 2018 was particularly cold, with a large accumulated snowpack, which limited the development of lakes to altitudes less than 800 m. There is evidence of inland expansion and increases in the total area of lakes compared to the early 2000s, as projected by future global warming scenarios.					; Blau, Manuel Tobias/HZI-5695-2023	Turton, Jenny/0000-0003-0581-8293; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				AUG 20	2021	15	8					3877	3896		10.5194/tc-15-3877-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3877-2021													WOS:000687656100001

A predominant mineral nutrient limitation existed when external C supply was high. During autumn, both nitrogen and phosphorus additions stimulated bacterial growth, while community respiration was stimulated by N and P combined, but not N alone. Additions of excess labile carbon (glucose) never stimulated either bacterial growth or respiration, while glucose and mineral nutrients combined gave rise to a vigorous production, suggesting that a strict C limitation is unlikely for heterotrophic bacteria in these lakes. Increased anthropogenic loadings of N and P may thus stimulate heterotrophic activity in humic lakes, increase degradation of humic matter, and finally increase CO2 outputs to the atmosphere. A prevailing mineral nutrient limitation of the bacteria would strongly affect the algal-bacterial competition and constrain phytoplankton production.					; Hessen, Dag Olav/AFI-5448-2022; Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022	Vahatalo, Anssi/0000-0003-3434-5915; Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847; 													0160-4120						1994	20	1					67	76		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90068-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(94)90068-X													WOS:A1994MU01800009
J	Mackay, JR; Burn, CR				Mackay, JR; Burn, CR			The first 20 years (1978-1979 to 1998-1999) of ice-wedge growth at the Illisarvik experimental drained lake site, western Arctic coast, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												In August 1978, a large tundra lake was drained to study the aggradation of permafrost into newly exposed lake-bottom sediments. Ice-wedge growth, which started in the first winter following drainage, had ceased in most of the lake bottom within about twelve years. The gradual cessation of thermal contraction cracking can be attributed to rapid vegetation growth, snow entrapment, an increase in winter ground temperatures, and a decrease in the linear coefficient of thermal contraction associated with freeze-thaw consolidation of the initially saturated lake-bottom sediments. The tilt and separation of markers in the active layer revealed gradual convergence towards the troughs even after ice-wedge growth had ceased. For the first few years the ice-wedge growth rate was up to 3 cm/a as determined by excavation, drilling, separation of the bottoms of benchmarks installed into permafrost, and divergence of free-floating inductance coils placed on the sides of ice wedges well below the bottom of the active layer. The vertical extent of most ice wedges was probably about 2 m, as deduced from the depths of ice-wedge cracks and the geometries of the wedge tops. Many thermal contraction cracks propagated upward to the ground surface from the tops of the ice wedges rather than downward from the ground surface. Small, upward facing, horizontal steps and vertical slickensided surfaces in permafrost on both sides of an excavated ice wedge near its top indicated that the adjacent permafrost had moved upward, relative to the wedge, from thermal expansion during the warming period.																			0008-4077					JAN	2002	39	1					95	111		10.1139/E01-048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E01-048													WOS:000174216000008
J	García-Berthou, E				García-Berthou, E			Spatial heterogeneity in roach (Rutilus rutilus) diet among contrasting basins within a lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Habitat and diet variation of roach (Rutilus rutilus) were studied in Lake Banyoles (Spain), an oligotrophic karstic lake with strong spatial heterogeneity in food resources. In addition to seasonal variation in diet, roach displayed an ontogenetic shift from zooplanktivory (dominated by the cladoceran prey Daphnia longispina) to benthivory (based on detritus, plant debris, amphipods, algae, and other invertebrates). Strong patterns of spatial heterogeneity in roach diet were detected for this lake. Firstly, there was a winter aggregation of smaller fish in the deepest basin, where benthos was scarce but a patch of copepods had been previously described. These fish displayed a high condition and fed on zooplankton, particularly those copepods. Secondly, meiobenthos, mainly ostracods and other microcrustaceans, was more important in the diet in the shallowest basin. The ontogenetic diet shift was also mediated by spatial heterogeneity, because in basins where benthos was scarce, larger roach continued to feed on zooplankton.

To abate this problem, the Great Lakes Agricultural Stewardship Initiative (GLASI) was initiated in Ontario, Canada, with the primary aim of reducing phosphorus pollution. Therefore, a case-study analysis of the Wigle Creek watershed, one of the six priority watersheds under the GLASI program, was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of various existing and potential future Best Management Practices (BMPs) and to identify BMPs that might aid in mitigating the watershed's contribution to phosphorus loads reaching Lake Erie. Given the watershed's very flat topography, hydrological/nutrient modeling proved an extremely challenging exercise. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used in this evaluation. Several digital elevation model (DEM) options were considered to accurately describe the watershed and represent flow conditions. A 30 m resolution DEM, implementing a modified burning in of streams based on ground truthing, was finally employed to develop the SWAT model's drainage framework. The model was first calibrated for flow, sediment, and phosphorus loads. The calibrated model was used to evaluate the ability of potential BMPs (minimum tillage, no-till, retiring croplands into pasture, retiring croplands into forest, winter wheat cover crop, and vegetative filter strips) to reduce phosphorus loads compared to implemented practice. Converting all croplands into pasture or forest significantly decreased P loads reaching Lake Erie. Comparatively, a winter wheat cover crop had minimal effect on reducing phosphorus loading.					; Shukla, Rituraj/AAX-9876-2021; Daggupati, Prasad/D-8886-2017; Rudra, Ramesh/AAA-7267-2022	Shukla, Rituraj/0000-0003-4543-8981; Stammler, Katie/0000-0003-2930-203X; Goel, Pradeep/0000-0002-0695-5321														2079-9276				DEC	2023	12	12							142	10.3390/resources12120142	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources12120142													WOS:001130893700001
J	Wilber, RL				Wilber, RL			Detection of DNA-recombinant human epoetin-alfa as a pharmacological ergogenic aid	SPORTS MEDICINE												The use of DNA-recombinant human epoetin-alfa (rhEPO) as a pharmacological ergogenic aid for the enhancement of aerobic performance is estimated to be practised by at least 3 to 7% of elite endurance sport athletes. rhEPO is synthesised from Chinese hamster ovary cells, and is nearly identical biochemically and immunologically to endogenous epoetin-alfa (EPO). In a clinical setting, rhEPO is used to stimulate erythrocyte production in patients with end-stage renal disease and anaemia. A limited number of human studies have suggested that rhEPO provides a significant erythropoietic and ergogenic benefit in trained individuals as evidenced by increments in haemoglobin, haematocrit, maximal oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2)max) and exercise endurance time. The purpose of this review is to summarise the various technologies and methodologies currently available for the detection of illicit use of rhEPO in athletes. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned the use of rhEPO as an ergogenic aid in 1990. Since then a number of methods have been proposed as potential techniques for detecting the illegal use of rhEPO. Most of these techniques use indirect markers to detect rhEPO in blood samples. These indirect markers include macrocytic hypochromatic erythrocytes and serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfr) concentration. Another indirect technique uses a combination of 5 markers of enhanced erythropoiesis (haematocrit, reticulocyte haematocrit. percentage of macrocytic red blood cells, serum EPO. sTfr) to detect rhEPO. The electrophoretic mobility technique provides a direct measurement of urine and serum levels of rhEPO. and is based on the principle that the rhEPO molecule is less negatively charged versus the endogenous EPO molecule. Isoelectric patterning/focusing has emerged recently as a potential method for the direct analysis of rhEPO in urine. Among these various methodologies, the indirect technique that utilises multiple markers of enhanced erythropoiesis appears to be the most valid, reliable and feasible protocol currently available for the detection of rhEPO in athletes. In August 2000, the IOC Medical Commission approved this protocol known as the 'ON model', and it was subsequently used in combination with a second. confirmatory test (isoelectric patterning) to detect rhEPO abusers competing in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. This combined blood and urine test was approved With modifications by the IOC in November 2001 for use in the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.																			0112-1642	1179-2035					2002	32	2					125	142		10.2165/00007256-200232020-00004	http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/00007256-200232020-00004								11817997					WOS:000173943800004

Due to damming and climate change, the water level during the middle of dry season (MDS) had a significant tendency of increasing in the two lakes. The habitat suitability for Anatidae, Charadriidae, Ardeidae and Laridae between the MDS with increasing of water level (DIW) and those with normal water level (DNW) were compared in this study, using geo-spatial overlay calculation, to reveal the responses of habitat suitability for migratory birds to increased water level during MDS in DTL and PYL. The results showed that the increased water level during MDS 1) had a negative influence on the habitat suitability for Anatidae and Charadriidae in DTL and PYL, and this influence in PYL was stronger than that of DTL; 2) had a neutral influence on the habitat suitability for Ardeidae in DTL and PYL, and this influence in PYL also was stronger than that of DTL; and 3) had a lesser negative influence on the habitat suitability for Laridae in DTL and had no influence on that of PYL.

J	Michaletz, PH; Bonneau, JL				Michaletz, PH; Bonneau, JL			Age-0 gizzard shad abundance is reduced in the presence of macrophytes: Implications for interactions with Bluegills	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The abundance of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum may be reduced in the presence of macrophytes, which may lessen the frequently observed negative interactions with coinhabiting bluegills Lepomis macrochirus. We used a series of experimental pond studies and a small-lake data set to examine relationships among gizzard shad, bluegills, and macrophytes. Fall age-0 gizzard shad abundance was lower in vegetated experimental ponds than in unvegetated ponds, but mean total length (TL) did not differ. Larval gizzard shad abundance did not differ between vegetated and unvegetated ponds, but the relative survival of age-0 gizzard shad (ratio of fall juveniles to the total number of larvae collected) was higher in unvegetated ponds. In ponds with macrophyte coverage ranging from 0% to 100%, age-0 gizzard shad abundance declined with increasing macrophyte coverage; however, age-0 bluegill abundance was unrelated to macrophyte coverage. The abundance and size of age-0 gizzard shad and age-0 bluegills were unrelated in these ponds. By examining the small-lake data, we found that the proportion of lakes containing gizzard shad decreased with increasing macrophyte coverage. The proportion of bluegill populations containing large adults (> 203 mm TL) increased with macrophyte coverage for lakes with gizzard shad but not for lakes without gizzard shad. Although the actual mechanisms are not clear, we suggest that competitive interactions between gizzard shad and adult bluegills are density dependent and lessen with increasing macrophyte coverage because of decreasing gizzard shad abundance.																			0002-8487					JAN	2005	134	1					149	159		10.1577/FT04-011.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/FT04-011.1													WOS:000227156200013

Innate response of rainbow trout gill epithelial (RTgill-W1) cell line to ultraviolet-inactivated VHSV and FliC and rhabdovirus infection	FISH AND SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY REPORTS												Gills reportedly play a crucial role in induction of an antiviral immune response in fish. We investigated the expression of innate response genes in the rainbow trout gill epithelial cell line RTgill-W1 36 h after pretreatment with ultraviolet-inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (UV-VHSV), flagellin C protein from Edwardsiella tarda (FliC), VHSV and SVCV using an Agilent 4 x 44k cGRASP salmonid microarray. RTgill-W1 cells pretreated with UV-VHSV, triggered an independent gene expression profile from those treated with a recombinant flagellin C protein from Edwardsiella tarda. In addition, exposure of RTgill-W1 cells to live viruses spring viremia of carp virus and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus induced a less robust transcriptional change of 24 and 22 gene probes, respectively, when compared to 123 genes for UV-VHSV. Further the pretreatment of RTgill-W1 cells with (UV-VHSV) significantly reduced VHSV genome copy number at 6 d post infection (dpi) relative to the FliC-treated and untreated control. A quantitative PCR was used to study the transcriptional modulation of a set of 25 innate immune-related genes highlighted by the microarray data and a panel of 7 established antiviral genes in the protected cells. Notably, the expression of ifn1, ifn2, mx1 and mx3 were expressed more in untreated cells than in UV-VHSV-treated cells where virus replication was inhibited. The results from this study shed light on the mechanisms and pathways used by teleost gill epithelium innate immunity in combating viral and bacterial infection.

Gut content analyse of three dominant fish species, perch (Perca), roach (Rutilus) and bream (Abramis) was performed during the same period. The dominant year classes of adult perch were subjected to more detailed analyses of food ration. Consumption of planktonic prey was low before and during the peak of perch spawning (late April). An exponential increase of perch feeding activity coincided with the end of their spawning and with the formation of the warm epilimnion. Large-sized daphnids (adults>1.0 mm) were positively selected irrespective of their relative abundance. This was particularly important during the period of low density of daphnids in early spring when the population of perch was able to eliminate a significant proportion of the Daphnia production. Later, in the end of May, some perch (70% of females, 18% of males) switched to feeding on littoral organisms such as insect larvae, Polyphemus and cyprinid fish eggs, while the rest consumed pelagic zooplankton. Roach and bream consumed a wider spectrum of planktonic organisms including Bosmina and small Daphnia. Inability to prey on small plankton and the absence of larger prey items probably led to the collapse of the perch population in the subsequent two years.

Efforts have centered around producing a second winter season of irrigated rice. However, a series of droughts in the region have led to widespread crop failure. We carry out a re-evaluation of weather station and environmental data and combine this with new information from a key archeological site in Central Thailand, Phromthin Tai, whose occupation covers a long and critical period of Thai prehistory. Based on these data, we argue that farmers in the area employed an adaptive and resilient agricultural and wild-plant-food-based subsistence system that was adapted to the region's high variability in rainfall. This subsistence system bridged the divide between the wild and cultivated and between wet and dry farming. The temporal and spatial diversity inherent in this system makes it vulnerable to destruction by agricultural policies that focus singly on improving yields.					; Higham, Tom/JOZ-0794-2023	Higham, Tom/0000-0002-5949-598X; d'Alpoim Guedes, Jade/0000-0002-2627-7863; 													1866-9557	1866-9565				DEC	2019	11	12					6473	6484		10.1007/s12520-019-00794-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-019-00794-8		NOV 2019											WOS:000497189700001

Spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved N2O concentration, diffusive N2O flux and relevant functional genes along a coastal creek in southeastern China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Increased anthropogenic input of nitrogen into coastal creeks make them potential hotspots for N2O production and emission, but they are often excluded from regional and global N2O budget, and high-resolution sampling is required to characterize the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity within the creeks. In this study, we analyzed the N2O concentration and diffusive N2O flux within a coastal creek in the Shanyutan Wetland in southeastern China in high spatial resolution across four seasons. Ancillary hydrographical variables and N2O-related functional gene abundances were also measured. Results showed that the creek was consistently oversaturated in N2O, at a seasonal average of 5.6-14.2 nmol/L, relative to the overlying atmosphere. The spatial distribution of N2O followed the gradient of nitrogenous substrate but was inversely related to the salinity gradient, and the coefficient of spatial variation of N2O flux ranged from 66.3 % to 116.5 %. Nitrite reduction (based on nirK and nirS gene abundances) and ammonia oxidation (AOA amoA and AOB amoA) appeared to outpace N2O reduction (nosZ I and nosZ II), and these were the main microbial processes that determined N2O concentration and flux. Both N2O concentration and flux were substantially higher in autumn than those in the other seasons, but that did not appear to be related to precipitation. N2O diffusive flux from the creek averaged 322.2 nmol m- 2 h-1, which was over 2 times higher than the global average for lakes and reservoirs. Our results highlight that coastal creeks are strong atmospheric N2O sources with high spatiotemporal variability.					; Lin, Yongxin/ACQ-6177-2022; Lai, Derrick/B-1387-2009	Tan, Lishan/0000-0002-9714-1728; Yongxin, Lin/0000-0002-0305-5766; yang, ping/0000-0002-5212-6065													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2024	637								131331	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131331		MAY 2024											WOS:001293698500001

Short term P release (96 hr) under laboratory resuspension conditions for two sediment sample types, surface sediments which represent sediment accumulated over several years and trap sediments which represent current year sediment, was studied. The experiments were carried out in oxic conditions at different pH values. According to phosphorus fractionation, Fe-bound-P, Al-bound-P and Organic-bound-P comprised the largest phosphorus pool (80% of Total Phosphorus). Phosphorus release was from the Fe-P, Al-P and organic fractions. These represent 35% of the total phosphorus content at pH 10. At circumneutral pH, in oxic conditions, a lower quantity of P was released (roughly 4% of total P sediment content) than at pH 10. The organic matter mineralization occurring at the end of summer can also influence P release as illustrated by the difference in total phosphorus content between sediment samples of 2000 and of the last five years. This type of P release was observed in Lake Courtille. High soluble reactive phosphorus content was measured in the water column at the end of summer. Aluminium treatment was thus not efficient in preventing P release. Moreover, a higher alum dose was needed to reduce P content in the water column in order to decrease primary productivity and subsequent organic matter sedimentation.					; van Hullebusch, Eric/C-3086-2018; van Hullebusch, Eric D./C-3086-2018; BAUDU, Michel/ABF-9742-2020	Deluchat, Veronique/0000-0002-9433-5658; van Hullebusch, Eric D./0000-0002-1519-1925; BAUDU, MICHEL/0000-0001-8604-0510; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2003	146	1-4					75	91		10.1023/A:1023914805034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023914805034													WOS:000183108400005
J	Fortner, SK; Tranter, M; Fountain, A; Lyons, WB; Welch, KA				Fortner, SK; Tranter, M; Fountain, A; Lyons, WB; Welch, KA			The geochemistry of supraglacial streams of Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley (Antarctica), and their evolution into proglacial waters	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We have investigated the geochemistry of supraglacial streams on the Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Antarctica during the 2001-2002 austral summer. Canada Glacier supraglacial streams represent the link between primary precipitation (i.e. glacier snow) and proglacial Lake Hoare. Canada Glacier supraglacial stream geochemistry is intermediate between glacier snow and proglacial stream geochemistry with average concentrations of 49.1 mu eq L-1 Ca2+, 19.9 mu eq L-1 SO42-, and 34.3 mu eq L-1 HCO3-. Predominant west to east winds lead to a redistribution of readily soluble salts onto the glacier surface, which is reflected in the geochemistry of the supraglacial streams. Western Canada Glacier supraglacial streams have average SO42-:HCO3- equivalent ratios of 1.0, while eastern supraglacial streams average 0.5, suggesting more sulfate salts reach and dissolve in the western supraglacial streams. A graph of HCO3- versus Ca2+ for western and eastern supraglacial streams had slopes of 0.87 and 0.72, respectively with R-2 values of 0.84 and 0.83. Low concentrations of reactive silicate (> 10 mu mol L-1) in the supraglacial streams suggested that little to no silicate weathering occurred on the glacier surface with the exception of cryoconite holes (1000 mu mol L-1). Therefore, the major geochemical weathering process occurring in the supraglacial streams is believed to be calcite dissolution. Proglacial stream, Anderson Creek, contains higher concentrations of major ions than supraglacial streams containing 5 times the Ca2+ and 10 times the SO42-. Canada Glacier proglacial streams also contain higher concentrations (16.6-30.6 mu eq L-1) of reactive silicate than supraglacial streams. This suggests that the controls on glacier meltwater geochemistry switch from calcite and gypsum dissolution to both salt dissolution and silicate mineral weathering as the glacier meltwater evolves. Our chemical mass balance calculations indicate that of the total discharge into Lake Hoare, the final recipient of Canada Glacier meltwater, 81.9% is from direct glacier runoff and 19.1% is from proglacial Andersen Creek. Although during a typical, low melt ablation season Andersen Creek contributes over 40% of the water added to Lake Hoare, its overall chemical importance is diluted by the direct inputs from Canada Glacier during high flow years.

J	Watmough, SA; Dillon, PJ				Watmough, SA; Dillon, PJ			The impact of acid deposition and forest harvesting on lakes and their forested catchments in south central Ontario: a critical loads approach	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The impact of acid deposition and tree harvesting on three lakes and their representative sub-catchments in the Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario was assessed using a critical loads approach, As nitrogen dynamics in forest soils are complex and poorly understood, for simplicity and to allow comparison among lakes and their catchments, CLs (A) for both lakes and forest soils were calculated assuming that nitrate leaching from catchments will not change over time (i.e. a best case scenario), In addition, because soils in the region are shallow, base cation weathering rates for the representative sub-catchments were calculated for the entire soil profile and these estimates were also used to calculate critical loads for the lakes These results were compared with critical loads obtained by the Steady State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model, Using the SSWC model, critical loads for lakes were between 7 and 19 meq m(-2) yr(-1) higher than those obtained from soil measurements, Lakes and forests are much more sensitive to acid deposition if forests are harvested, but two acid-sensitive lakes had much lower critical loads than their respective forested sub-catchments implying that acceptable acid deposition levels should be dictated by the most acid-sensitive lakes in the region, Under conditions that assume harvesting, the CL (A) is exceeded at two of the three lakes and five of the six sub-catchments assessed in this study. However, sulphate export from catchments greatly exceeds input in bulk deposition and, to prevent lakes from falling below the critical chemical limit, sulphate inputs to lakes must be reduced by between 37% and 92% if forests are harvested. Similarly, sulphate leaching from forested catchments that are harvested must be reduced by between 16 and 79% to prevent the ANC of water draining the rooting zone from falling below 0 mueq 1(-1). These calculations assume that extremely low calcium leaching losses (9-27 mueq 1(-1)) from forest soils can be maintained without any decrease in forest productivity, Calcium concentrations in the three lakes have decreased by between similar to 10 and 25% over the past 20 years and calculations assume that calcium concentrations in lakes can fall to around 30% of their current values without any harmful effects on biota, Both these assumptions require urgent investigation.

Strong correlation between Aphanizomenon abundance in Lake Kinneret, Israel, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity suggests that inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation induces the PHO regulon and APase secretion [3]. Staining lake samples with DAPI [4] revealed a high level of polyphosphate bodies (PPB) in Aphanizomenon. Application of enzyme-labeled fluorescence (ELF-APase) [5] showed APase in various organisms, but not in Aphanizomenon. ELF-APase signals and extracellular APase activity in Aphanizomenon were detected only after exploiting PPB under prolonged Pi deprivation in cultures or toward the end of its autumn bloom. Pi deprivation of Aphanizomenon induces CYN production, high-affinity Pi uptake, and an internal, not external, APase. Addition of Aphanizomenon spent media or CYN to various phytoplanktons, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, induced genes typically upregulated under Pi limitation and a rise in extracellular APase activity, despite ample surrounding Pi. Coculturing Aphanizomenon with Chlamydomonas or with Debarya sp. showed positive ELF-APase signals, but not in Aphanizomenon. CYN producers promote Pi supply by inducing APase secretion by other phytoplanktons, possibly explaining their increased abundance despite reduced Pi supply from watersheds.

Modeling the thermal dynamics of Mediterranean reservoirs. Amadorio Reservoir application case (Alacant, Spain). Water Technology and Sciences (in Spanish). Vol. IV, No. 1, January-March, 2013, pp. 5-25. Water quality in lakes and reservoirs is influenced by several physical, chemical and biological processes. Among them, the thermal stratification cycle is one of the most influential factors. Increased water temperature leads to less solubility of oxygen and an increase in microbial activity. Therefore, modeling is highly important to the study of water quality in lake and reservoirs. This study presents the use of the DYRESM hydrodynamic reservoir model to simulate the thermal structure of the Amadorio reservoir during a six-year period. The Amadorio reservoir is a typical Mediterranean reservoir with high summer releases. The calibration and sensitivity analyses developed demonstrate the importance of the method to calculate cloud cover and the extinction coefficient in the results of the model. Otherwise, in this case and considering what is usual, wind velocity is not one of the determinant factors. Finally it is demonstrated that turbulence processes generated by high summer releases lead to hypolimnion temperatures, which are difficult to model using this tool.

The total catch in 57 seine hauls was 69 000 kg and the average catch per haul 1210 kg (250-6500 kg). The average biomass removed from the fishing area per haul was 120 kg ha(-1) (SD 116) in the deepest basins(depth > 15 m), where smelt (Osmerus eperlanus L.) dominated the catches. The corresponding catch was 192 kg ha(-1) (SD 187) in a shallower basin (<15 m) where the catch comprised mainly cyprinids, all age classes of bream (Abramis brama L.) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus L.) and juveniles (1 + and 2 +) of roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) and bleak. The catches were composed of aggregated fish since there was no correlation between the length of the haul and weight of the catch and the biomass removed from the fishing area was high. The under-ice pelagic schooling pattern of fish distribution was confirmed by scanning sonar monitoring which was effectively utilized in fishing. Winter seining is a suitable method for selective fish removal both in fisheries management and in biomanipulation of temperate lakes which are ice-covered for several months during a year.

The study focuses on differences among phytoplankton size fractions characterised by their surface area to volume ratio ([mm(2) l(-1): mm(3)l(-1)]), pigment distribution patterns and photosynthetic rates. Particular attention was paid to autotrophic picophytoplankton (APP, fraction < 2 mu m) since this size fraction differed significantly from the two larger size fractions. Among the three fractions, APP showed the highest surface area to volume ratios and a high persistence in the pattern of lipophilic pigments between temporarily and spatially successive samples (about 80% similarity of pigment composition between samples over seasons and depths). The epilimnetic abundance of APP varied seasonally with an annual maximum of 180 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) in June (at 4-9 m). The minimum (October at 12 m) was more than an order of magnitude lower (4.9 x 10(3) ml(-1)). APP peaked during autumn and contributed between 24% and 42% to the total area-integrated Chl a (10-23 mg m(-2)) and between 16% and 58% to total area-integrated production (5-64 mg m(-2) h(-1)) throughout seasons.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides nest in shallow littoral areas, making them vulnerable to negative effects of habitat alteration due to development of lake shorelines and fishing during the spring nesting period. For instance, alteration of shorelines may reduce the quality and abundance of nesting habitat, and the high visibility of nests and the aggressive guarding behavior of nesting males increase their vulnerability to fishing. In 2004. we monitored nest distribution and success and quantified local nest habitat features, lakewide angler effort, and lakeshore development patterns in five Michigan lakes to determine the extent to which habitat alteration and fishing limit the number of nests that produce swim-up fry. Lakes spanned a range of lakeshore dwelling densities (8-22 dwellings/km), allowing us to determine the extent to which nest success varies within and among lakes due to local (e.g., substrate and cover) and lakewide (e.g., dwellings/km and fishing effort) factors. Surprisingly, local habitat characteristics were not important determinants of the probability that a nest would produce swim-up fry (P > 0.05). At the whole-lake scale, however, nest success was negatively related to dwelling density; the probability of producing swim-up fry declined from 0.77 in the lake with the lowest dwelling density to 0.45 in the lake with the highest dwelling density (P = 0.018). Lakewide estimates of angling effort could not explain the difference among lakes, indicating the likely importance of quantifying angling at finer spatial scales. Knowledge of the magnitude of anthropogenic effects and the spatial scale at which they operate is integral for the management of black bass Micropterus spp.					Wagner, Tyler/MIU-0726-2025														0002-8487					JUL	2006	135	4					843	852		10.1577/T05-198.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-198.1													WOS:000240325200001

Study focus: This study investigates the influence of rainfall, river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the Tarago Reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. New hydrological insights for this region: In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the Tarago Reservoir. The model allowed 3D visualization of the thermal structure, and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the Schmidt stability index. The simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones. The bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability; furthermore, the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones. In addition, this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification. Moreover, the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies. The patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones.

J	Tanasevitch, AV; Rybalov, LB				Tanasevitch, Andrei V.; Rybalov, Leonid B.			Spatial distribution of spiders (Aranei) and other groups of soil macrofauna in the arctic tundra of northeastern Taimyr, Russia	ARTHROPODA SELECTA												Numerous materials have been processed on soil invertebrates collected by the International Arctic Expedition of the Institute for Evolutionary Morphology and Animal Ecology, Russian Academy of Sciences in 1991 in arctic tundra of eastern Taimyr, near Pronchishchev Lake. The samples revealed six spider species of the only family Linyphiidae, all of them being typical purely arctic. The most common species were Erigone psychrophila Thorell, 1872. Hilaira gertschi Holm, 1960 and Sent arcticus (Eskov. 1989). The first two species inhabited all the studied biotopes. whereas E. psychrophila was super-dominating in each of these biotopes. The fauna of spiders of zonal communities was poorer than that in intrazonal ones (3-4, vs 4-6 species). Spiders play the main role in the structure of the soil macrofauna population of arctic tundra of eastern Taimyr. This group is the most diverse, is the most vast component of the macrofauna, and most earlier in the activity after the winter diapause. The second important group are the beetles (Carabidae and Staphylinidae). While spiders are primary in abundance and the share in the total macrofauna in zonal communities, the intrazonal biotopes are characterized by approximate parity of these groups. The share of spiders in the macrofauna decreases during the summer due to diapause end in other invertebrate groups: the soil samples show a decrease from 38% in June to 30% in July, the data from pitfall traps show a decrease from 75% to 38%. In soil samples, spiders comprised 23-50% of the number of all soil macrofauna in the beginning of vegetation season (June). while declining to 18-36% in the mid season (July). The total number of soil macrofauna in zonal communities is about twice lower on the average than that in intrazonal ones (82, vs 149 spins/m(2)); the number of spiders is 1.5 times lower (31, vs 48 spms/m(2)), that of beetles is almost 4 times lower (16, vs 62 spms/m(2)). The share of spiders in the macrofauna of zonal communities is considerably higher than that of beetles (39, vs 19%). whereas their shares are approximately the same in intrazonal communities (36, vs 38%). According to data of pitfall traps, the share of spiders is high during the whole season and comprises 50-89%, the share of beetles is much inferior to that of spiders: 8-44%. In the zonal composition, both spiders and other groups of macrofauna are represented by arctic species. A list of spider species is provided for vicinities of Pronchishchev Lake and the nearby Maria Pronchishcheva Bay. The species Hilaira gertschi, H. nivalis Holm, 1937 and S. arcticus are for the first time registered in the fauna of eastern Taimyr, and Pronchishchev Lake is the northernmost locality (75. 287026 degrees N) of the presently known species distribution. The data on number and the population density are for the first time provided for various groups of soil macrofauna in arctic tundra.

J	Abu-Jaber, NS				Abu-Jaber, NS			A new look at the chemical and hydrological evolution of the Dead Sea	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Hydrological models of the Dead Sea (DS) indicate that subrecent equilibrium conditions have been maintained by input and evaporation of about 1600 x 10(6) m(3)/yr of surface waters. Recent diversions of the headwaters have led to a drop of about 0.95 m/yr, suggesting that waters stored in adjacent aquifers are being drained at a rate of about 200 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. Chemical modeling of the DS indicates that the chemical evolution of the waters can be explained by a simple mixture and evaporation model. This model requires the input of 50 x 10(6) m(3)/yr of hot spring waters similar to those emanating at Zohar and evaporation factors of about 50. This model suggests that the DS salts have accumulated over the past 5000 years. This indicates that the initiation of the present DS was triggered by the onset of the Mid Holocene pluvial stage as well as by draining of the freshwater lakes present upstream from the lake. Review of the data of the springs responsible for the chemical nature of the DS suggests that these waters are of meteoric-continental origin and that it is likely that these waters have experienced deep circulation in the rift system before discharging at the surface due to convective forces operating in the rift.

Geographic segregation and evidence of density-dependent changes in sex ratios in an abundant colonial waterbird	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY												Demographic information, such as geographic segregation of sexes and sex ratio data, is needed to develop, model and evaluate conservation and management strategies for wildlife. A variety of physiological, behavioral and environmental factors can influence segregation of sexes and sex ratios, many of which originate with density-dependent processes. Departure from 50:50 sex ratios of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected during control efforts in breeding and wintering areas across their eastern range of the USA were evaluated using using a Z-test as well as Stouffer's weighted Z-tests. In addition, a specifically-designed randomization test was used to evaluate density-dependent effects on primary sex ratios in cormorants from egg collections and colony nest count data over a 21-year period. Cormorants collected from breeding colonies were strongly male-biased, whereas cormorants collected from feeding flocks were slightly biased toward females. Cormorants were partly segregated by sex on the wintering grounds, with significantly more males found in areas with intensive channel catfish aquaculture. The null hypothesis that females produced a balanced sex ratio independent of number of nesting cormorants was rejected: more male embryos were produced during rapid population growth, whereas at maximum nesting number more female embryos were produced. Once populations stabilized, the sex ratio was more equal. This examination of sex ratios indicates that different management methods and locations result in sex-biased culling of cormorants. Sex-biased culling in cormorants could make population reduction efforts more efficient and reduce overall take. We suggest further research to examine density-dependent effects on primary sex ratios documented here.					; Guillaumet, Alban/MVW-5830-2025; Dorr, Brian/AAX-9033-2020	Dorr, Brian/0000-0001-6857-8560; Hanson-Dorr, Katie/0000-0003-4559-938X; Guillaumet, Alban/0000-0002-1021-7807; DeVault, Travis/0000-0001-6413-1104													1749-4877	1749-4869				NOV	2014	9	5					570	582		10.1111/1749-4877.12091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12091								24750575					WOS:000345695200003

Anoxia begets anoxia: A positive feedback to the deoxygenation of temperate lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Declining oxygen concentrations in the deep waters of lakes worldwide pose a pressing environmental and societal challenge. Existing theory suggests that low deep-water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations could trigger a positive feedback through which anoxia (i.e., very low DO) during a given summer begets increasingly severe occurrences of anoxia in following summers. Specifically, anoxic conditions can promote nutrient release from sediments, thereby stimulating phytoplankton growth, and subsequent phytoplankton decomposition can fuel heterotrophic respiration, resulting in increased spatial extent and duration of anoxia. However, while the individual relationships in this feedback are well established, to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic analysis within or across lakes that simultaneously demonstrates all of the mechanisms necessary to produce a positive feedback that reinforces anoxia. Here, we compiled data from 656 widespread temperate lakes and reservoirs to analyze the proposed anoxia begets anoxia feedback. Lakes in the dataset span a broad range of surface area (1-126,909ha), maximum depth (6-370m), and morphometry, with a median time-series duration of 30years at each lake. Using linear mixed models, we found support for each of the positive feedback relationships between anoxia, phosphorus concentrations, chlorophyll a concentrations, and oxygen demand across the 656-lake dataset. Likewise, we found further support for these relationships by analyzing time-series data from individual lakes. Our results indicate that the strength of these feedback relationships may vary with lake-specific characteristics: For example, we found that surface phosphorus concentrations were more positively associated with chlorophyll a in high-phosphorus lakes, and oxygen demand had a stronger influence on the extent of anoxia in deep lakes. Taken together, these results support the existence of a positive feedback that could magnify the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic pressures driving the development of anoxia in lakes around the world.

The Role of Cloud-Top Generating Cells and Boundary Layer Circulations in the Finescale Radar Structure of a Winter Cyclone over the Great Lakes	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Data from airborne W-band radar are used in conjunction with thermodynamic fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model and air-parcel back trajectories from the HYSPLIT model to investigate the finescale reflectivity, vertical motion, and airmass structure of the comma head of a winter cyclone in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. Cloud-top generating cells formed along an upper-level frontal boundary vertically separating dry air, which 48 h earlier was located in the upper troposphere over south-central Canada, from moist air, which was located in the lower troposphere over the southeast United States. The stronger updrafts within the generating cells had vertical velocities ranging from 1 to 3 m s(-1). The generating cells were important to precipitation production within the comma head. Precipitation trails formed within the generating cells could sometimes be followed to the boundary layer before merging. Boundary layer air beneath the cyclone's comma head exhibited convective circulations and was turbulent. Gravity waves were sometimes observed at the base of the stable layer atop the convective boundary layer. Trajectory analyses showed that boundary layer air sampled by radar beneath the aircraft path had a history of crossing the Great Lakes. The magnitude of updrafts and downdrafts in the boundary layer were 1-2 m s(-1), while wave circulations exhibited maximum updrafts and downdrafts of similar to 3 m s(-1). The tops of some boundary layer convective circulations and gravity waves exhibited enhancements in radar reflectivity. The data presented illustrate the impact of the Great Lakes on cyclone mesostructure during the passage of a cyclone through the region.					; McFarquhar, Greg/R-9154-2018	Rauber, Robert/0000-0003-2880-6148; Keeler, Jason/0000-0001-7812-882X; Plummer, David/0000-0002-2329-0552; McFarquhar, Greg/0000-0003-0950-0135													0027-0644	1520-0493				JUN	2015	143	6					2291	2318		10.1175/MWR-D-14-00350.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-14-00350.1													WOS:000355190900017

The Kuishan Member in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton, formed in association with general regression of an epicontinental sea, is composed of abundant volcanic deposits and nearshore sedimentary deposits. Three lithofacies assemblages together with eleven lithofades are identified in the study area including volcanic deposits of the turbidity lithofades assemblage, epidastic deposits of the nearshore lithofacies assemblage, and mixed volcaniclastic and epiclastic sedimentary deposits of the terrestrial lithofacies assemblage. These alternating volcanic-epiclastic lithofacies assemblages illustrate the depositional environments induced by volcanic activities and nearshore wave influence. Syn-eruptive lithofades, in the shallow water area, were formed by high density turbidity currents and ash fall into water introduced by rising sea levels and high rainfall due to volcanic eruptions to the north, whereas thin-bedded shallow marine silty mud developed in the distal area. Inter-eruptive lithofacies were represented by tuffaceous mudstone deposited in an exposed and oxidized setting due to falling sea level, whereas epidastic nearshore deposits accumulated by wave or current flow regimes. Paleocurrent measurements show that the predominant regression direction changes from uniform southwest to divergent southwest and southeast during volcanic inter-eruptive periods. The Kuishan succession therefore can be regarded as a volcano-related sequence, in which the input of volcaniclastic and epidastic deposits were significantly modulated by controls of volcanism, with frequently changing coastline position of the epicontinental sea and alternating depositional environments.

We performed a 5-month experiment (starting in winter, December) to elucidate the responses of three phototrophic communities (macrophyte-Potamogeton crispus, periphyton, phytoplankton) and their interactions to elevated temperature (4.5 A degrees C) under eutrophic, subtropical conditions. The biomass and composition of periphyton were not significantly affected by increased temperature, while the biomass of phytoplankton increased with a shift in phytoplankton composition towards higher dominance of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria. Warming also reduced the survival of P. crispus and accelerated the decline of P. crispus. At both ambient and heated temperatures, a shift occurred at the end of the experiment from a clear-state dominated by P. crispus to a clear-state dominated by filamentous algae and warming facilitated this shift. Our results thus indicated that, when submerged macrophytes diminished or disappeared, filamentous algae exhibited functional compensation that maintained low phytoplankton development, primarily at elevated temperatures.

Postglacial conditions, characterized by warmer than present summer temperatures, prevailed in Baffin Island and NE Labrador beginning about 7500 and 7000 C-14 yr BP, respectively, resulting in warmer than present conditions throughout the region by 6000 C-14 yr BP (+0.5degreesC to 1degreesC). Further south, in Quebec and W Labrador, July temperatures were 1-2degreesC colder than present until after 6000 C-14 yr BP, and only reached modern values after all residual Laurentide ice had melted. Increased summertime insolation and the final disappearance of Laurentide Ice during the middle Holocene probably caused July temperatures throughout eastern Canada to peak between approximately 5000 and 3500 C-14 yr BP. Mid-Holocene warming relative to today was more pronounced in Baffin Island and NE Labrador (+ 1degreesC to 2degreesC) compared to the boreal and subarctic regions of Quebec and W Labrador (< + 1degreesC). Over the past 4000 years, decreasing summertime insolation and colder sea surface temperatures in the Davis Strait and Labrador Sea contributed to a decline in July temperatures of 1-2degreesC throughout Baffin Island, and the tundra regions of N Quebec and Labrador. The absence of similar cooling in the records from the boreal forest may support the notion that the mean position of the summertime polar front blocked the colder Arctic air during the late Holocene.

Invasive goldfish (Carassius auratus) maintain aerobic scope across acute warm water temperatures	BIOLOGY OPEN												Goldfish (Carassius auratus) were first introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes when it was first introduced into Lake Ontario in the 1800s. In the past 15 years, there have been dramatic increases in both goldfish abundance and geographic spread across North America, including the Great Lakes, raising concerns about its potential for negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Climate studies suggest that habitat ranges suitable for goldfish will continue to expand in the future as water temperatures rise towards its thermal optima. We explore whether warmer temperatures are physiologically suitable for a population of wild, invasive goldfish (Hamilton, ON, Canada) by testing aerobic scope (AS) at current (26 degrees C) and predicted (30 degrees C) peak summer water temperatures. Goldfish were first acclimated to a common-garden average summer pond temperature (22 degrees C), then their AS was estimated by calculating the difference between routine and maximum metabolic rates (RMR and MMR) at the two test temperatures. Our results demonstrate that wild goldfish sustain their AS through increases in both RMR and MMR from 26 degrees C to 30 degrees C (mass-standardized means of 1.07 versus 1.17 mgO2h-1 at 26 degrees C versus 30 degrees C, respectively). This ability to sustain aerobic energy budget at high peak water temperatures could offer physiological benefits to this invasive population in a warming climate.

J	Park, C; Schmincke, HU				Park, Cornelia; Schmincke, Hans-Ulrich			Boundary conditions for damming of a large river by fallout during the 12,900 BP Plinian Laacher See Eruption (Germany). Syn-eruptive Rhine damming II	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Rhine River (Germany) - the largest river in Western Europe - was dammed by pyroclastic material multiple times during the major Plinian Laacher See Eruption (12.900 BP). Dams formed both upstream and downstream of the broad tectonic Lower Neuwied Basin (LNB) which interrupts the narrow Rhine canyon. Here we document upstream damming of the Rhine River at the entrance to the LNB close to the present city of Koblenz due to overloading with tephra fall into the Rhine and its major tributaries, the Moselle and the Lahn. The dam was formed repeatedly during rapid pumice tephra fall events and became breached during breaks in eruptive activity, causing extensive, high-energy flooding throughout the entire basin. The ephemeral Koblenz dams differed significantly from "normal" volcanically-induced darns by being composed principally of washed-together pumice lasts and some driftwood. The porous nature of pumice and its ability to absorb water were crucial factors. Thus, a large volume percentage of the tephra that had fallen into the Rhine floated submerged within the upper part of the water column or swam at the surface. Moreover, the absorption of the river water by the pumice clasts increased the sediment:water ratio of the two-phase flow considerably. We here present a model of dam formation resembling the formation of ice jams. We visualize the Koblenz dams to have been elongate, partly floating and partly grounded, permeable plugs several kilometers long and rising no higher than the flood plain. Damming was most plausibly initiated in the LNB within the area of maximum tephra loading and propagated upstream in a chain reaction similar to the formation of traffic jams. A major dam was finally accumulated at the bottleneck entrance to the LNB, a site combining several favorable conditions: the upstream multi-channel Rhine was confined to a single channel, change of flow direction by 125 degrees, extremely low gradient (0.19%.) starting already 24 km upstream of the bottleneck, constant decrease of flow velocity over several kilometers towards the bottleneck and the Moselle River - largest tributary of the Rhine within the LNB and an important conveyor of additional tephra masses - entered the Rhine only 700 m upstream of the bottleneck. We assume that the Koblenz dams could only have formed and been stabilized by an extremely long "foot region" that extended many kilometers downstream and that was possibly connected to one or several low-rise secondary jams/dams. The backwater of Lake Brohl that was dammed by pyrodastic flows 7 km downstream of the LNB about halfway through the eruption extended upstream into the LNB during the second Plinian stage of the Laacher See Eruption and was probably a major factor contributing to the formation and large size of Koblenz Dam No.4. The Koblenz dams were probably not completely sealed most of the time. This way, the major pre-eruptive Rhine channel received some water. An equilibrium condition was established that allowed the dams to remain stable as long as tephra fell into the Rhine relatively continuously. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In summer 2013, a distinct oxygen gradient in the metalimnion with the oxygen concentration sharply decreased to 0 mg/L and in succession a high mortality rate in a fish farm was observed. At the same time, the Koschen channel with a lock connecting the nearby pit lake Geierswalder See started operation and increased the input of ferrous iron. In June 2013, a flood of the river Schwarze Elster passed through the lake. The investigation of the causes of the observed distinct oxygen gradient was based on a systems analysis approach. All available meteorological, hydrological, limnological, hydrochemical, and biological data were analysed. A dynamic water balance model and a stratification model for the lake Senftenberger See were assembled. The stratification model was created as a 2D-model based on the model software CE-QUAL-W2 and was calibrated on the basis of measured temperature profiles. The thermal stratification behaviour of the lake Senftenberger See was simulated for a time series. The effect of specific water balance variables on the water quality of the lake Senftenberger See was quantified by modeling the migration of a conservative tracer. The investigation results showed that the meteorological conditions in the year 2013 caused the distinct temperature and oxygen gradient in the metalimnion. The channel between the lake Geierswalder See and the lake Senftenberger See as well as the flood in June 2013 could be excluded as a cause. The long-term monitoring shows that the distinct metalimnic oxygen gradient was not a singular event in summer 2013. Similar conditions were observed in the lake Senftenberger See in previous years and in 2013 in other pit lakes, too. It has been shown that the 2-dimensional limnophysical modeling with CE-QUAL-W2 is well suited to simulate the thermal stratification and the spatial migration of solutes in highly structured pit lakes. The simulated stratification of the Senftenberger See was in good accordance with the measured data. The model thus represents a good base for the further examination of additional water quality problems and its application to other pit lakes.																					978-3-86012-533-5				2016							261	268																WOS:000402663400044

This is a relevant issue in Saxony, Central East Germany, and many other regions worldwide, where drinking water is produced from raw waters with noticeable presence of chromophoric DOM (CDOM), which is assumed to originate from forested watersheds in spring regions of the catchment area. For improved comprehension of DOM molecular composition, the seasonal and spatial variations of humic-like fluorescence and elemental formulas in the catchment area of the Muldenberg reservoir were recorded by excitation emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). The Spearman rank correlation was applied to link the EEMF intensities with exact molecular formulas and their corresponding relative mass peak abundances. Thereby, humic-like fluorescence could be allocated to the pool of oxygen-rich and relatively unsaturated components with stoichiometries similar to those of tannic acids, which are suspected to have a comparatively high disinfection byproduct formation potential associated with the chlorination of raw water. Analogous relationships were established for UV absorption at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and compared to the EEMF correlation.

J	Mannio, J				Mannio, J			Recovery pattern from acidification of headwater lakes in Finland	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					6th International Conference on Acidic Deposition	DEC 10-16, 2000	TSUKUBA, JAPAN					Acid sensitive headwater lakes (n=163) throughout Finland have been monitored during autumn overturn between 1987-1998. Statistically significant decline in sulphate concentration is detected in 60 to 80 percent of the takes, depending on the region. Median slope estimates are from -1.1 mu eq L-1 in North Finland to -3.3 mu eq L-1 in South Finland. The base cation (BC) concentrations are still declining especially in southern Finland (slope -2.5 mu eq L-1), where every second lake exhibits a significant downward trend. The BC slope is steeper for lakes with less peatlands, more exposed bedrock, longer retention time and southerly location, but these factors are inter correlated. Gran alkalinity slope medians for the three regions range from 1.4 to 1.8 mu eq L-1 yr (-1). No significant negative alkalinity trends were detected. The similarity in the slopes of SO,, BC and alkalinity in this data compared to seasonal sampling data from Nordic Countries can be regarded as indirect evidence that autumnal sampling is representative for long term monitoring for these ions. There are no indications of increased organic carbon in lakes, as found in some recent trend analyses of similar regional data sets. Although the processes behind the positive development in these lakes have to be revealed with site- specific intensive studies, this data suggests, that the initial recovery from lake acidification in Finland is a regional phenomenon.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1427	1432		10.1023/A:1013904812254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013904812254													WOS:000172012000086

Voluntary or soft transportation policies have included air quality alert systems that encourage people not to drive on days when the air quality index is above a specified threshold and public education/action campaigns that focus on reducing automobile related travel. In this article, we evaluate the effectiveness of one such soft policy, the Clear the Air Challenge (CAC), in reducing ground-level ozone during the Wasatch Front's summer ozone season. Using daily ozone data and color-coded daily air quality designations from 2006 through 2012, we estimate a range of nonequivalent control group models. In only one of the models does the CAC generate a statistically significant but small reduction in ground-level ozone. Future research should assess the full range of costs and benefits to the public associated with such soft transport policies.

J	FEDERLE, TW; VESTAL, JR				FEDERLE, TW; VESTAL, JR			LIGNOCELLULOSE MINERALIZATION BY ARCTIC LAKE-SEDIMENTS IN RESPONSE TO NUTRIENT MANIPULATION	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Mineralization of specifically labeled 14C-cellulose- and 14C-lignin-labeled lignocelluloses by Toolik Lake, Alaska [USA], sediments was examined in response to manipulation of various environmental factors. Mineralization was measured by quantifying the amount of labeled CO2 released from the specifically labeled substrates. NH4NO3 and to a greater degree PO4-3 additions enhanced the mineralization of white pine (Pinus strobus) cellulose during the summer of 1978. N and P together had no cumulative effect. During the summer of 1979, N or P alone had only a slight stimulatory effect on the mineralization of a sedge (Carex auatilis) cellulose; together they had a dramatic effect. This variable response of mineralization to nutrient addition between 1978 and 1979 was probably attributable to year-to-year variation in nutrient availability within the lake. Cellobiose addition and oxygen depletion inhibited the amount of pine cellulose mineralized. Whereas addition of nitrogen to oxygen depleted treatments had limited effect, addition of phosphorus resulted in mineralization equal to or greater than that of the controls. N had no effect on mineralization of pine or Carex lignins. P inhibited mineralization of both lignins. With Carex lignin, the P inhibition occurred at a concentration as low as 0.1 .mu.M. The antagonistic role of P in cellulose and lignin mineralizations may be of significance in understanding the increased proportion of lignin relative to cellulose in decomposing litter.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1980	40	1					32	39		10.1128/AEM.40.1.32-39.1980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.40.1.32-39.1980								16345594					WOS:A1980KA46700006
J	Pomara, LY; Zuckerberg, B				Pomara, Lars Y.; Zuckerberg, Benjamin			Climate variability drives population cycling and synchrony	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim There is mounting concern that climate change will lead to the collapse of cyclic population dynamics, yet the influence of climate variability on population cycling remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that variability in survival and fecundity, driven by climate variability at different points in the life cycle, scales up from local populations to drive regional characteristics of population cycling and spatial synchronization. Location Forest in the US Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. Methods We tested hypotheses linking variation in vital rates of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), a declining species that displays decadal population cycles, to temperature and precipitation anomalies and land use intensity, using rate estimates from multiple locations in eastern North America. We used climatedemographic linkages to simulate spatially explicit population dynamics from 1982 to 2069, evaluated predictions against monitoring data and assessed predicted population dynamics under future climate projections. Results Nest success and winter survival were linked to temperature and precipitation anomalies, and demographic models explained important spatiotemporal characteristics of cycling and synchrony in monitoring data. The climate-driven vital rates were necessary for cycling and synchrony in models, even though the four included climate variables were not individually periodic. Cycling and synchrony were stronger at more northerly latitudes, but this transition occurred abruptly, reflecting regional variation in winter conditions. Forecasts suggested climate-driven cycling through mid-century, followed by desynchronization and dampening. Main conclusions Climate variability can drive spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates, and population cycling can result from these relationships. Pathways linking climate to broad-scale population dynamics involve responses of vital rates to several climate variables at different times of year and may be more complex than direct responses to known modes of climate variability. The wide-ranging impact of climate change on the demographics of northerly adapted species has the potential to degrade patterns of population synchrony and cycling.

C. flavicans possibly produced a 2nd annual generation. Fourth instars of both species were strong diel migrators and occupied similar strata at most times. C. punctipennis 4th instar diet consisted almost entirely of rotifers. C. flavicans ate rotifers but fed heavily also on daphnids in May and Aug. C. punctipennis 4th instars showed little growth until early spring, possibly owing to a sparseness of rotifers, then grew rapidly until pupation. C. flavicans had a slow, but relatively constant growth rate at all times during the open water season, presumably because its greater mouth gape allowed it a wider range of food items.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	107	2					155	164		10.1007/BF00017430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017430													WOS:A1983RT27700006
J	Lorenschat, J; Schwalb, A				Lorenschat, Julia; Schwalb, Antje			Autecology of the extant ostracod fauna of Lake Ohrid and adjacent waters - a key to paleoenvironmental reconstruction	BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding the ecology of bioindicators such as ostracods is essential in order to reconstruct past environmental and climate change from analysis of fossil assemblages preserved in lake sediment cores. Knowledge of the ecology of ancient Lake Ohrid's ostracod fauna is very limited and open to debate. In advance of the Ohrid ICDP-Drilling project, which has potential to generate high-resolution long-term paleoenvironmental data of global importance in paleoclimate research, we sampled Lake Ohrid and a wide range of habitat types in its surroundings to assess 1) the composition of ostracod assemblages in lakes, springs, streams, and short-lived seasonal water bodies, 2) the geographical distribution of ostracods, and 3) the ecological characteristics of individual ostracod species. In total, 40 species were collected alive, and seven species were preserved as valves and empty carapaces. Of the 40 ostracod species, twelve were endemic to Lake Ohrid. The most common genus in the lake was Candona, represented by 13 living species, followed by Paralimnocythere, represented by five living species. The most frequent species was Cypria obliqua. Species with distinct distributions included Heterocypris incongruens, Candonopsis kingsleii, and Cypria lacustris. The most common species in shallow, flooded areas was H. incongruens, and the most prominent species in ditches was C. kingsleii. C. lacustris was widely distributed in channels, springs, lakes, and rivers. Statistical analyses were performed on a "Lake Ohrid" dataset, comprising the subset of samples from Lake Ohrid alone, and an "entire" dataset comprising all samples collected. The unweighted pair group mean average (UPGMA) clustering was mainly controlled by species-specific depth preferences. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) with forward selection identified water depth, water temperature, and pH as variables that best explained the ostracod distribution in Lake Ohrid. The lack of significance of conductivity and dissolved oxygen in CCA of Ohrid data highlight the uniformity across the lake of the well-mixed waters. In the entire area, CCA revealed that ostracod distribution was best explained by water depth, salinity, conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Salinity was probably selected by CCA due to the presence of Eucypris virens and Bradleystrandesia reticulata in short-lived seasonal water bodies. Water depth is an important, although indirect, influence on ostracod species distribution, which is probably associated with other factors such as sediment texture and food supply. Some species appeared to be indicators for multiple environmental variables, such as lake level and water temperature.

Water samples from nine stations, sediment samples from 23 stations, plankton samples from five stations, and six species of macroalgae were collected and subjected to heavy metal analysis using atomic absorption spec-trophotometry (AAS). Only Cu and Zn were detected in the water samples. The plankton samples had only Zn, Cu, and Cr. The average metal concentrations in macroalgae fell in the decreasing order of Cu > Zn > Cr > Cd > Pb. In sediment samples, the metal order was as follows: Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd. Multivariate statistical an-alyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the source of the metal contamination. The metals were found to originate from a blend of both anthropogenic and geogenic sources. Pollution monitoring indices including geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor, contamination degree (Cdeg), pollution load index (PLI), and potential ecological risk (PER) were calculated using the metal data. In the study area, Igeo values of the metals showed pollution grades from 0 (uncontaminated) to 6 (extremely contaminated). Cdeg fell in classes from 1 (low contamination) to 4 (very high contamination). PLI values ranged between 0 and 5.68. PER values expressed that except for a few stations located at higher elevations in the glacial outwash plains, all other sites were highly polluted. The high level of pollution indices in the sites can be attributed to the anthropogenic activities persistent in the study area.

Filtered Baltic Sea water was exposed to solar radiation for 12-19 days. Along with dark controls, samples were inoculated with an indigenous nanoplankton (< 10 mu m) community and incubated under photosynthetically active radiation and N-limiting conditions (molar dissolved inorganic nitrogen to PO43- ratio of 0.2). The concentration of particulate nitrogen, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and the biomass of phytoplankton and protozoa increased more in the solar radiation-exposed waters than in dark controls, showing that the photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) supported both heterotrophic and autotrophic plankton. In order to calculate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for the photochemical reactions, the experimentally determined photoproduced bioavailable N (the formed particulate N and mineralized DON) and the phytoplankton biomass stimulated by DOM photochemistry were related to the number of photons absorbed by chromophoric DOM. Model calculations based on AQY indicated that DOM photochemistry produces 2226 mu mol bioavailable N m(-2) d(-1) and stimulates phytoplankton biomass by 12-14 mu g Chl a m(-2) d(-1) during summer in the northern Baltic Sea. Photoproduced bioavailable N potentially supports 1.2% and 3.6% of the new primary production and its N-demand, respectively, in this study region during summer. In N-limited surface waters, the photoproduction of bioavailable N from biologically recalcitrant, but photoreactive DOM can provide a new source of N and sustain the background productivity of a nanoplankton community, including phytoplankton.

Evidence suggests that the herbicide fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4(1H)-pyridinone) can be used to selectively target monotypic stands of invasive aquatic plants, while leaving native plant species and the habitat heterogeneity intact. We evaluate efficacy of a fall, low-dose treatment of fluridone on a Eurasian watermilfoil-infested Michigan Lake to enhance multi-species growth and habitat heterogeneity. In October 2000, approximately three liters of Sonar (R) AS (fluridone) were injected subsurface, covering the entire 15-ha lake to provide a whole-lake target application rate of 8 mu g/L. A second application was applied 40 days after initial treatment to boost the rate back to the original target level. Habitat heterogeneity was defined as biomass, stem density, relative abundance, diversity and species richness. Pre- and post-treatment measurements (N = 3) were made at 24 sites in the lake littoral zone. Total plant biomass decreased after treatment, due to the removal of Eurasian watermilfoil. Shifts in the plant community resulted in increased native plant abundance and stem density for two years following initial herbicide treatments suggesting enhancement in habitat heterogeneity within the littoral zone potentially important to the fishery.																			0146-6623					JAN	2006	44						26	31																WOS:000237173000004

Food Differentiation of Juvenile Brown TroutSalmo truttaL. as a Mechanism for Expanding the Food Supply of the Population	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The feeding habits of brown trout (age 2+ and 3+ years) in the small Orzega River (Lake Onega basin) are analyzed with an autumn decrease in the number of accessible food items. Along with the previously determined mechanisms for compensating for this phenomenon (feeding directly from the bottom and consumption of large items), a sharp increase in the variability of the individual feeding habits of sea trout in October is revealed both by the composition of the contents of its stomachs and by the amount of consumed feed. The food differentiation of individuals makes it possible to expand the food supply of the brown trout population in the river and effectively use the food resources of the small watercourse, which is particularly important during the period of low availability.

It was possible to reproduce the in situ observed AOBr increase in the laboratory. Batch experiments were performed with lake water from two different lakes and an algae culture. It could be shown that the AOBr production is not limited to strong waste water influenced lakes. Furthermore, the AOBr formation requires light and the presence of algae, and thus is most probably biotic in nature. A low content of nutrients favours the formation of organic bromine compounds. To our knowledge this is the first report about the seasonally occurrence of naturally produced organic bromine compounds in lakes/surface waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

MARINE GEOLOGY												Numerous small calcite mounds, up to 2.5 m in diameter and 0.75 m in height, accompanied by Ba, Hg and TI mineralisation, occur in shallow submarine hydrothermal vents on the sea bottom, at 10 m depth, near Punta Mita, on the western coast of Mexico. The hydrothermal activity consists in water and gas (mainly nitrogen and methane) venting at 85 degreesC, through a 100-m-long fissure hosted in basaltic rocks and partially covered by a thin layer of unconsolidated detrital sediments. The mounds consist of travertine-like calcite aggregates that develop around the main submarine hot springs amidst a hydrothermally altered basaltic host rock. Two main calcite generations are texturally recognisable: the first generation shows a radial-fibrous texture; the second is fine-grained calcite, which cements detrital grains and fills the pore spaces. The delta(13)C analyses of calcite reveal a strong depletion in C-13, with values as low as -39.2parts per thousand (Vienna PeeDee Belemnite), which suggest that microbial communities may have induced calcite precipitation through microbial methane oxidation. Barite, sulphides (mainly pyrite and cinnabar) and phosphates (carbonate-hydroxylapatite) are also present in the mounds in lower concentrations and form by direct precipitation from the hydrothermal fluid. The Punta Mita hydrothermal carbonate mounds represent a potentially novel environment for microbially induced carbonate mineralisation, which is characterised by high temperatures not encountered in areas of cold seep carbonate formation. Stable isotope results suggest that microorganisms responsible for the oxidation of methane may be present and active at temperatures near 85 degreesC at the Punta Mita vents. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Groundwater flow and heterogeneous discharge into a seepage lake: Combined use of physical methods and hydrochemical tracers	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Groundwater discharge into a seepage lake was investigated by combining flux measurements, hydrochemical tracers, geological information, and a telescopic modeling approach using first two-dimensional (2-D) regional then 2-D local flow and flow path models. Discharge measurements and hydrochemical tracers supplement each other. Discharge measurements yield flux estimates but rarely provide information about the origin and flow path of the water. Hydrochemical tracers may reveal the origin and flow path of the water but rarely provide any information about the flux. While aquifer interacting with the lake remained under seemingly steady state conditions across seasons, a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the discharge to the lake was observed. The results showed that part of the groundwater flowing from the west passes beneath the lake and discharges at the eastern shore, where groundwater springs and high discharge zones (HDZs) are observed at the lake bottom and at seepage faces adjacent to the lake. In the 2-D cross section, surface runoff from the seepage faces delivers 64% of the total groundwater inputs to the lake, and a 2 m wide offshore HDZ delivers 13%. Presence of HDZs may control nutrient fluxes to the lake.

We conducted extensive sediment incubation experiments to investigate CH 4 fluxes in Lake Stechlin, a deep, stratified temperate lake. Our results show contrasting spatial patterns in CH 4 fluxes between littoral and profundal sites. The littoral sediments, - 33% of the total sediment surface area, contributed - 86.9% of the annual CH 4 flux at the sediment -water interface. Together with sediment organic carbon quality, seasonal stratification is responsible for the striking spatial difference in sediment CH 4 production between littoral and profundal zones owing to more sensitive CH 4 production than oxidation to warming. While profundal sediments produce a relatively small amount of CH 4 , its production increases markedly as anoxia spreads in late summer. Our measurements indicate that future lake CH 4 emissions will increase due to climate warming and concomitant hypoxia/anoxia.

Here, annual water discharge and sediment load data (1956-2017) and rainfall data (1960-2016) from Dongting Lake in the middle catchment of the Yangtze River were analysed at four major inlets and one outlet, and their connections with lake level variations were evaluated using multiple analytical methods. The results show that minor fluctuations were found in rainfall and discharge during the study period, but the sediment load entering Dongting Lake decreased significantly from 231 mt/year (before 1969) to 123 mt/year (1970-2002) and then 17 mt/year (after 2003, post TGD). The variation in the sediment was mainly induced by increasing anthropogenic activities in the lake system. During period 1 (before 1969), human impact was weak compared to the dominant natural forces. However, anthropogenic force showed an increasing contribution to the loss of sediment load since then, as it increased from 43.0% (1970-1987, post cut-off engineering) to 64.8% (1988-2002, post Gezhou Dam) and extended to 90.2% during 2003-2017 (post TGD). Nevertheless, continuous sediment accumulation over the past decades in the lake has caused a rising water level. During period 1, high sediment input contributed to an average annual increase of 13.96cm in the lake level, but it decreased significantly to 1.94 cm year(-1) during 1970-2002 due to intensive anthropogenic regulations. Since 2003, the completion of the TGD intercepted abundant sediment, eventually leading to a shift from net deposition to net loss of the sediment budget in Dongting Lake, and consequently, the lake level fell. In the future, if the net sediment supply was kept below similar to 18 mt/year, the lake level would continue to fall, causing severe problems to the lake ecosystem, especially during drought years.

The objective was to see how precipitation and snowmelt chemistry is modified before it reaches the stream. Intermittent snowmelt occurred throughout winter, and 65 to 78% of total snowpack loss of H+, NH4+, NO3- and SO42- occurred before peak snowpack and snowmelt. From 70 to 95% of snowmelt H+, NH4+, and NO3- was retained in the forest floor and shallow mineral soil by exchange, adsorption, or biological uptake. Snowmelt SO42- concentration was enriched in forest: floor percolate and shallow soil water probably by organic mineralization, low adsorption, and perhaps desorption. The significant relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and SO42- concentration in forest floor percolate and shallow soil water indicates organics map contribute to reduced SO42- adsorption. Sulfate and organic anions were major contributors to base cation (C-B) flux in the forest floor while SO42- was related to C-B flux in shallow soils. A decline in mineral soil and streamwater DOC concentration and increase in streamwater HCO3- relative to concentrations in forest floor percolate suggests the relative importance of organic decomposition decreased and soil mineral weathering increased with soil depth, High streamwater Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3- concentrations indicated that soil mineral weathering was a major process altering snowmelt chemistry at the watershed level.																			0047-2425					JUL-AUG	1996	25	4					828	836		10.2134/jeq1996.00472425002500040026x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1996.00472425002500040026x													WOS:A1996UX56900052

This study was performed to assess whether the observed sex ratio of a Population of stinkpots (Sternotherus odoratus) was an artifact of sampling biases. A total of 989 stinkpots (637 males, 352 females) was captured from 1996 through 2000 at Spring Lake, Aquarena Center, Hays County, Texas. The overall sex ratio based on all census techniques was significantly male-biased (1.8M:1F). The sex ratio changed across size classes. Data from a bimonthly trapping experiment from May 1999 through May 2000, in which hoop traps baited with either a food source or a mature female stinkpot, reinforced the view that the observed sex ratio in this Population is inherently skewed, and not an artifact of sampling techniques.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				DEC	2003	48	4					543	549		10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0543:SAOCIT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0543:SAOCIT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000188387800006

Holocene development of Boreal forests and fire regimes on the Kenai Lowlands of Alaska	HOLOCENE												Several studies have noted a relationship between vegetation type and fire frequency, yet despite the importance of ecosystem processes such as fire the long-term relationships between disturbance, climate and vegetation type are incompletely understood. We analysed pollen, plant macrofossils and sedimentary charcoal from three lakes within the Kenai lowlands to determine postglacial relationships between disturbance, climate and vegetation for the Boreal forest of southwest Alaska. An herb tundra was established in the lowlands following deglaciation by 13 000 cal. BP. Salix, Alnus and probably Betula kenaica, expanded in the area after 10 700 cal. BP, followed by Picea glauca by 8500 cal. BP. Picea mariana became established by 4600 cal. BP. The early Holocene was probably the driest time during the postglacial, as determined by aquatic plant macrofossils and climate models. Lake levels reached near-modern conditions by at least 8000 cal. BP. Mean Fire Intervals (MFI) were longest during the shrub-herb tundra phase (138 +/- 65 yr), decreased after expansion of B. kenaica, Salix and Populus (77 +/- 49 yr) and Picea glauca (81 +/- 41 yr), and increased again with the arrival of P. mariana (130 +/- 66 yr). Unlike previous studies, our data demonstrate the highest fire frequencies during the early to mid-Holocene and less frequent fire during the late Holocene when P. mariana forests dominated the lowlands. Early Holocene forests of P. glauca and B. kenaica existed in summers that were longer and drier than today, while the increasingly wetter and cooler climates of the late Holocene probably hindered forest fire around Paradox Lake, perhaps because of less frequent summer drought.

Fracture propagation to the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet during supraglacial lake drainage	SCIENCE												Surface meltwater that reaches the base of an ice sheet creates a mechanism for the rapid response of ice flow to climate change. The process whereby such a pathway is created through thick, cold ice has not, however, been previously observed. We describe the rapid (< 2 hours) drainage of a large supraglacial lake down 980 meters through to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet initiated by water- driven fracture propagation evolving into moulin flow. Drainage coincided with increased seismicity, transient acceleration, ice- sheet uplift, and horizontal displacement. Subsidence and deceleration occurred over the subsequent 24 hours. The short- lived dynamic response suggests that an efficient drainage system dispersed the meltwater subglacially. The integrated effect of multiple lake drainages could explain the observed net regional summer ice speedup.

Measurements of complete CH4 flux components from subtropical rivers draining agricultural watersheds are particularly important since these rivers are subject to large organic and nutrient loads. Two-year measurements of CH4 fluxes were taken to assess the magnitude of CH4 emissions from the Lixiahe River (a tributary of the Grand Canal) draining a subtropical rice paddy watershed in China. Over the two-year period, annual CH4 emissions averaged 29.52 mmol m(-2) d(-1), amounting to 10.78 mol m(-2) yr(-1), making the river a strong source of atmospheric CH4. The CH4 emissions from rivers during the rice-growing season (June-October) accounted for approximately 70% of the annual total, with flux rates at 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those for rice paddies in this area. Ebullition contributed to 44-56% of the overall CH4 emissions from the rivers and dominated the emission pathways during the summer months. Our data highlight that rivers draining agricultural watersheds may constitute a larger component of anthropogenic CH4 emissions than is currently documented in China.					; Hu, Tao/JOZ-6744-2023; li, shuqing/KEI-9007-2024; ZOU, JIANWEN/B-3059-2012; WU, SHUANG/HRA-0836-2023	ZOU, JIANWEN/0000-0003-4689-9237; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 2	2019	53	7					3499	3507		10.1021/acs.est.8b05286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b05286								30865437					WOS:000463679600017
J	Coolbaugh, MF; Gustin, MS; Rytuba, JJ				Coolbaugh, MF; Gustin, MS; Rytuba, JJ			Annual emissions of mercury to the atmosphere from natural sources in Nevada and California	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The impact of natural source emissions on atmospheric mercury concentrations and the bio-geochemical cycle of mercury is not known. To begin to assess this impact, mercury emissions to the atmosphere were scaled up for three areas naturally enriched in mercury: the Steamboat Springs geo-thermal area, Nevada, the New Idria mercury mining district, California, and the Medicine Lake volcano, California. Data used to scale up area emissions included mercury fluxes, measured in-situ using field flux chambers, from undisturbed and disturbed geologic substrates, and relationships between mercury emissions and geologic rock types, soil mercury concentrations, and surface heat flux. At select locations mercury fluxes were measured for 24 h and the data were used to adjust fluxes measured at different times of the day to give an average daily flux. This adjustment minimized daily temporal variability, which is observed for mercury flux because of light and temperature effects. Area emissions were scaled spatially and temporally with GIS software. Measured fluxes ranged from 0.3 to approximately 50 ng m(-2) h(-1) at undisturbed sites devoid of mercury mineralization, and to greater than 10,000 ng m(-2) h(-1) from substrates that were in areas of mercury mining. Area-averaged fluxes calculated for bare soil at Steamboat Springs, New Idria, and Medicine Lake of 181, 9.2, and 2 ng m(-2) h(-1), respectively, are greater than fluxes previously ascribed to natural non-point sources, indicating that these sources may be more significant contributors of mercury to the atmosphere than previously realized.

The authors reflect on the challenges of defining Cultural Ecosystem Services and interpreting and translating these categorisations for the purposes of questionnaire research. Previous studies had noted the difficulties inherent in capturing many of the intangible elements inherent in the CES terminology. Familiarisation with CES categories arguably affords new opportunities to bring together many of the disparate elements which have often been managed independently in landscape and tourism studies (e.g. cultural and intangible heritage, eco-systems, socio-cultural impacts of tourism and community-based tourism). A questionnaire was designed consisting of nineteen statements which related closely to the CES categorisations. It was translated into eight languages and distributed in autumn 2015 to visitors in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Macedonia, Netherlands and Poland in six different kinds of landscape: forest, mountains, lakeside, seaside, mountains, desert and a combination of nature and manmade. In total, 876 valid questionnaires were obtained and were proven statistically to make a useful contribution to the field of CES research, landscapes and tourism studies.

This study aims to reveal the improvements seen in an urban river undergoing a practical water eco-remediation after being replenished with reclaimed water. A one-year monitoring of water quality, phytoplankton, and zooplankton was carried out in Dongsha River undergoing eco-remediation in Beijing, China. The results showed that compared to the unrestored river, the concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, TP, and TN decreased by 28.22 +/- 7.88 %, 40.24 +/- 11.77 %, 44.17 +/- 17.29 %, and 28.66 +/- 10.39 % in the restoration project area, respectively. The concentration of Chlorophyll-a in the restoration area was maintained below 40 mu g/L. During summer, when algal growth is vigorous, the density of Cyanophyta in the unrestored river decreased from 46.84 x 104cells/L to 16.32 x 104cells/L in the restored area, while that of Chlorophyta decreased from 41.61 x 104cells/L to 11.87 x 104cells/L, a reduction of 65.16 % and 71.47 %, respectively. The dominant phytoplankton species were replaced with Bacillariophyta, such as Synedra sp. and Nitzschia sp.,indicating that the restoration of aquatic plants reduces the risk of Cyanophyta blooms. Zooplankton species also changed in the restoration area, especially during summer. The density of pollution -tolerant Rotifer and Protozoa decreased by 31.06 % and 27.22 %, while the density of clean water indicating Cladocera increased by 101.19 %. We further calculated the diversity and evenness index of phytoplankton and zooplankton within and outside the restoration area. The results showed that the Shannon -Weaver index for phytoplankton and zooplankton in the restoration area was 2.1 and 1.91, which was higher than those in the river (1.84 and 1.82). This further confirmed that aquatic plant restoration has positive effects. This study can provide a practical reference and theoretical basis for the implementation of water ecological restoration projects in other reclaimed water rivers in China.					shi, Xinlei/AAD-1200-2021; Long, Xiaoyan/GXF-8672-2022; Liu, Yongze/ABE-2327-2021	Chen, Ai/0009-0008-3639-8563; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 20	2024	926								172024	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172024		APR 2024						38547989					WOS:001221457300001

Both lakes show strong similarity with other mining lakes in terms of low pH, high metal and sulphate contents. Still, they have distinctly limnological and geochemical characteristics. The results indicate Ravlidmyran Lake is oligotrophic and meromictic. It is permanently stratified due to vertical density gradients, which strongly controls the vertical elemental distributions. Udden is a dimictic lake. The autumn overturning cause most limnological parameters and chemical components distribute homogeneously. The thermal strata when stratified do not control the elemental distribution. In both lakes, it is found that the scavenging processes by particles are not a significant factor controlling trace metal distributions due to the low suspended particle concentration. Sulphate reduction was not observed, although the oxygen concentration is poor in the deep waters. Thus precluding an important precipitation of trace metals as metal sulphides.																					90-5809-593-2				2003							201	212																WOS:000186710100024

However, there are differences in the climate response of the vegetation in different regions during the LIA, and high-resolution quantitative research is lacking. Here, we present a high-resolution pollen analysis and the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) based on relative pollen productivity, combined with AMS 14C dating, to quantitatively reconstruct the vegetation response to climate and sea level change on the western coast of Bohai Sea. The main findings are as follows: (1) The coverage of the main plant taxa reconstructed using estimates of relative pollen productivity was closer to the actual vegetation conditions than that based on pollen percentages. (2) Since -1250 A.D., the study area was occupied by temperate deciduous broadleaved forest, dominated by Quercus, with a smaller proportion of Pinus forest. The regional vegetation types did not change significantly, but the forest cover decreased gradually from -60% in the Middle Warm Period (MWP, 1250-1310 A.D.) to -40% in the LIA (1310-1610 A.D.), due to the combined influences of climate and human activities. (3) The composition of herbaceous plants changed substantially during the LIA. In the early LIA (1310-1450 A.D.), the climate became cold and dry and the sea level began to fall, resulting in a substantial increase in the proportion of Poaceae (-10%). In the middle of the LIA (1450-1610 A.D.), the climate became colder and drier, the sea level fell further, and the lagoon shrank. In response, there was an increase in drought and salt-tolerant Chenopodiaceae (-10%) and Artemisia (-5%), a substantial increase in Selaginella sinensis supplied by fluvial processes.

Comparative Study of Trapping Methods for Ground-nesting Shorebirds	WATERBIRDS												Several methods exist to capture ground-nesting birds, yet questions remain concerning their effectiveness, cost and safety. An experiment was conducted comparing traps commonly used to capture ground-nesting shorebirds. Data were collected on Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) nesting at Great Salt Lake, Utah during the 2009 breeding season. The three most common traps used to capture nesting Snowy Plovers (spring trap, walk-in funnel trap, leg-hold noose mats) were compared in the time required to use the trap (e.g. time to install at nest), capture success and construction costs. These results indicated that the funnel trap had the lowest total time at the nest (P < 0.01) and per trapping attempt, highest capture rate, fewest failed set up attempts, low disturbance to the nest site and was the least expensive to build. Based on these findings, the funnel trap should allow avian researchers to maximize their time, resources and efforts when trapping ground-nesting shorebirds.

Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6+/-0.8degreesC higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 12-10ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada. The delayed warming in Quebec and Labrador was linked to the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet, which chilled the region through its impact on surface energy balance and ocean circulation. The lingering ice also attests to the inherent asymmetry of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that predisposes the region to glaciation and modulates the pattern of climatic change. The spatial asymmetry of warming during the HTM resembles the pattern of warming observed in the Arctic over the last several decades. Although the two warmings are described at different temporal scales, and the HTM was additionally affected by the residual Laurentide ice, the similarities suggest there might be a preferred mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation that generates a recurrent pattern of warming under positive radiative forcing. Unlike the HTM, however, future warming will not be counterbalanced by the cooling effect of a residual North American ice sheet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Secondary production of Chironomidae in a large eutrophic lake: implications for lake sturgeon production	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Most foodweb research in lentic systems has focused on pelagic primary (phytoplankton) and secondary (zooplankton) production as the primary energy sources for higher trophic-level production. Recent research has demonstrated that secondary production of benthic primary consumers can affect pelagic fish production and foodweb structure in lakes. We used the instantaneous growth method to calculate secondary production of chironomids in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin (USA), where previous research has shown that lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) rely heavily on the benthos (chironomids) as a food source. We also used literature-derived data and the instantaneous growth method to calculate annual production of lake sturgeon to test whether chironomid production is sufficient to support the current lake sturgeon population in Lake Winnebago. We collected benthic samples with an Ekman grab at 4 profundal sites during ice-free conditions on 11 dates from spring 2008 through spring 2009. We measured instantaneous growth rates for 7 chironomid length classes at 5 thermal regimes in the laboratory. Mean annual density of Chironomidae was 2714 individuals/m(2), mean biomass was 2.75 g dry mass (DM)/m(2), and mean annual production of Chironomidae was 7.59 g DM m(-2) y(-1). Estimated annual production of lake sturgeon was 0.02 g DM m(-2) y(-1) in 2007. We concluded that in 2008-2009 chironomid secondary production was sufficient to support the lake sturgeon population in Lake Winnebago. The annual production rates for chironomids in Lake Winnebago are higher than rates in many other lakes in North America, presumably because of the eutrophic condition of Lake Winnebago.

Impact of nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton production and bacterial community structure in two stratified Antarctic lakes: a bioassay approach	POLAR BIOLOGY												Arctic, Antarctic, and alpine ecosystems are recognized as sensors and sentinels of global change. As a consequence of their high sensitivity to minor climatic perturbations, permanently ice-covered lakes located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, represent end members in the global network of inland bodies of water. Episodic climatic events in the form of increased summer glacial melt result in inputs of organic sediment and nutrients from glacial streams to these closed basins. Phytoplankton communities residing in the oligotrophic water columns are highly responsive to pulses in nutrient availability; however, there is a lack of understanding on whether specific phytoplankton groups are more competitive during a summer flood event and how shifts in the phytoplankton community may influence heterotrophic bacteria. A bioassay approach in 3-l bottles was used to investigate the influence of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus availability on planktonic communities from the oligotrophic upper waters of two chemically distinct MDV lakes (Lakes Bonney and Fryxell) which differ in their external inputs and water column N/P stoichiometry. While microbial community responses varied between lakes and were nutrient-dependent, stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and productivity across all treatments was strongly linked with increased abundance of a single phytoplankton phylum (Chlorophyta). Despite stimulation of phytoplankton growth, primary and bacterial productivity was generally uncoupled; however, shifts in bacterial community diversity were observed in bioassays amended with either P or NP. We suggest that climate-associated increases in phytoplankton production and concomitant shifts in diversity will influence MDV bacterial community structure by altering the availability and composition of autochthonous carbon for heterotrophic production.

The median enterococcal numbers of 5 samples collected from each site over each season were compared to the guideline medians: 35 and 33 enterococci per 100 ml for marine and fresh waters, respectively. The ''5-sample median'' values generally agreed with longer-term medians (n = 24, 28) from river and estuary sites sampled between 1990 and 1994. During the summers of 1991 and 1993, high enterococcal numbers at marine and lake swimming sites were assumed to be derived primarily from sewage effluent and farm run-off, either directly or from freshwater inflows. Enterococcal numbers dropped significantly in these waters when effluents were either treated or removed from the waters. In 1995, all marine bathing waters complied with the guideline value of 35 enterococci per 100 mi. Evidence from long-term monitoring of estuary sites indicated that most marine bathing sites have high-quality bathing water with short-term variability caused by winds, tides, and outfall discharges. In 1995, all but one lake site complied with the freshwater median guideline of 33 enterococci per 100 mi. Most upstream river sites also complied with the freshwater guideline. However, river sites in the mid reaches and down stream recorded high enterococcal numbers which increased slightly at some sites from 1992 to 1995. The most significant increase in bacterial numbers was recorded in the small river and stream swimming holes which carry low volumes of water (< 1000 l s(-1)), particularly in the western area of Lake Rotorua. The main source of enterococci in river waters was most likely run-off from dairy farms on the flood plains of the various rivers of the Bay of Plenty.

Selected heavy metals in water, sediment, and plant samples from the lake were also comparatively determined. The results indicated that most general physico-chemical properties of the lake water fell within those recommended for drinking water. However, the lake water was found to be high in some heavy metals, which also accumulated in the sediment.

The data were analyzed to determine the atmospheric conditions under which the contrails formed and to measure several physical properties of the contrails, including areal coverage, spreading rates, fall speeds, and optical properties. Most of the contrails were located between 10.6 and 11.8 km in atmospheric conditions consistent with a modified form of the Appleman contrail formation theory. However, the Rapid Update Cycle-2 analyses have a dry bias in the upper-tropospheric relative humidity with respect to ice (RHI), as indicated by persistent contrail generation during the outbreak where RHI greater than or equal to 85%. The model analyses show that synoptic-scale vertical velocities affect the formation of persistent contrails. Areal coverage by linear contrails peaked at 30 000 km(2), but the maximum contrail-generated cirrus coverage was over twice as large. Contrail spreading rates averaged around 2.7 km h(-1), and the contrails were visible in the 4-km Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite ( GOES) imagery approximately 1 h after formation. Contrail fall speed estimates were between 0.00 and 0.045 m s(-1) based on observed contrail advection rates. Optical depth measurements ranged from 0.1 to 0.6, with consistent differences between remote sensing methods. Contrail formation density was roughly correlated with air traffic density after the effects of competing cloud coverage, humidity, and vertical velocity were considered. Improved tropospheric humidity measurements are needed for realistic simulations of contrail and cirrus development.

We used two data sets to determine if common measures of ecosystem health; abundance, species richness, diversity and evenness, were affected by the presence of hydrilla. Data Set 1 consisted of 27 Florida lakes, 11 of which had hydrilla present for approximately 4-8 years in varying abundances, and 16 did not have hydrilla. Given the number of lakes, each was sampled only once in the summers of 1986-1990 for community measures of aquatic plants, birds, and fish. Data Set 2 consisted of 12 lakes, six with abundant hydrilla for over 23 years and six without hydrilla. These lakes were sampled every year in the summer (with a few exceptions due to weather conditions) between 1999 and 2006 for community measures of aquatic plants and fish. The results for both data sets show that presence of hydrilla had no statistically significant effect (P > 0.05) on all community measures tested (i.e., richness, diversity, abundance). Our conclusions support the hypothesis that hydrilla in these Florida lakes has occupied a mostly vacant ecological niche and has not affected the occurrence or relative composition of native species of aquatic plants, birds, and fish. Because pond experiments have found negative effects of hydrilla, further focused research is needed to assist management decisions when considerable resources are to be spent each year on hydrilla suppression.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	4					331	338		10.1080/07438140809354843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354843													WOS:000269666900004

Low-volume overbank deposition of fine-grained alluvium by Yugu stream over the past 10,000 years has produced a sequence that is well suited for delta C-13 analysis of soil organic matter. The delta C-13 values varied between -25 parts per thousand and -20 parts per thousand during the Holocene, showing significant millennial-scale fluctuations in five stages (11,000-8900 cal BP, 8900-6100 cal BP, 6100-3300 cal BP, 3300-1200 cal BP, and 1200 cal BP to present). The abundance of C-4 plants, estimated from a binary mixing model, changed from approximately 17-57%. During the stages from 3300 to 1200 cal BP and from 8900 to 6100 cal BP, C-4 plant abundance and the percentage of arboreal pollen were high, but the percentage of spores (mainly moss) and the freshwater algal sum were low, indicating more arid environments. Temporal comparison of C-4 plant abundance change during the Holocene with other reconstructed climate data from East Asia suggests that millennial-scale vegetation change (or aridity change) in central South Korea was generally more synchronous with regional climate change during the late Holocene than during the early to mid-Holocene. This study suggests that the past vegetation in the Yugu area has evolved in response to summer monsoon intensity in a non-linear manner. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated associations between satellite-derived chlorophyll a data from the Barents Sea and 2 key abiotic factors: sea surface temperature and sea-ice concentration. Specifically, we investigated how climate variability, through the measured physical factors, associated with phytoplankton phenology between 1998 and 2014. Associations between sea surface temperature and phytoplankton bloom dynamics differed depending on the area. The spring phytoplankton bloom occurred earlier and had higher magnitude in warm compared to cold years in the northern part of the Barents Sea, but there was no significant association in the southern part. In seasonally ice-covered regions, the association between the timing of the sea-ice retreat and the phytoplankton peak was nonlinear: sea-ice retreat time before mid-May was not associated with bloom timing, whereas the phytoplankton bloom occurred before or immediately following the ice retreat when the ice retreated after mid-May. Although drivers that are relatively constant across years, such as insolation, probably influenced the spatial gradient in chlorophyll, a space-for-time substitution captured the predicted effects of sea-ice retreat on the timing and magnitude of the phytoplankton bloom quite well.					; Stige, Leif/P-6806-2015; Stige, Leif Christian/P-6806-2015; Kvile, Kristina/AAO-6084-2020; Stenseth, Nils/G-5212-2016	Kvile, Kristina Oie/0000-0003-2771-9077; Dong, Kaixing/0000-0002-6842-7145; Stige, Leif Christian/0000-0002-6808-1383; 													0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 6	2020	635						25	36		10.3354/meps13218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps13218													WOS:000521737900003

A study was made of the population dynamics of benthic cladocerans in the River Thames, U.K. These included three species of Chydoridae (Alona affinis Leydig, Disparalona rostrata (Koch 1841) and Leydigia leydigi Schodler) and one species of Macrothricidae Illiocryptus sordidus (Lievan). 2. The pattern of chydorid abundance was similar to that found in many lakes; a midsummer peak followed by a sharp decrease in number and subsequent low abundance. This was caused by a temporary decrease in natality, possibility due to food limitation, and a more permanent increase in mortality, thought to be due to predation. 3 Iliocryptus sordidus differed considerably from the chydorids, the major population peak occurring in the autumn. The lifestyle and adult size of Illiocryptus sordidus (Lievan) must render adults less vulnerable to invertebrate and fish fry predation. 4. A literature survey showed that the assemblage of species found in the unvegetated littoral of lakes and rivers included a taxocene of cladocerans.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1990	24	2					375	389		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00717.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00717.x													WOS:A1990ED56800014

This was done by random screening of clone libraries for the g20 gene and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed 35 distinct cyanomyovirus g20 genotypes among the 47 sequences analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these sequences fell into seven genetically distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The distances between these OTUs were comparable to those reported between marine clusters. Moreover, some of these freshwater cyanophage sequences were genetically more closely related to marine cyanophage sequences than to other freshwater sequences. Both approaches for the g20 gene (sequencing and DGGE analysis) showed that there was a clear seasonal pattern of variation in the composition of the cyanophage community that could reflect changes in its biological, chemical, and/or physical environment.

We report first observations on the thermal and radiation regime under ice of the largest freshwater lake of the Plateau. The results reveal that freshwater lakes on the Tibetan Plateau fully mix under ice. Due to strong solar heating, water temperatures increase above the maximum density value 1-2 months before the ice break, forming stable thermal stratification with subsurface temperatures >6 degrees C. The resulting heat flow from water to ice makes a crucial contribution to ice cover melt. After the ice breakup, the accumulated heat is released into the atmosphere during 1-2 days, increasing lake-atmosphere heat fluxes up to 500 W m(-2). The direct biogeochemical consequences of the deep convective mixing are aeration of the deep lake waters and upward supply of nutrients to the upper photic layer.

Planktonic metabolism in a Mediterranean reservoir during a near-surface cyanobacterial bloom	LIMNETICA												Summer blooms of large, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing and potentially toxic cyanobacteria are characteristic of many productive, warm monomictic reservoirs in the Mediterranean region, where they constitute stable assemblages. The accumulation of positively buoyant cyanobacteria at the surface layers of the water column favours among others the interception of light, inorganic carbon and nitrogen fluxes from the atmosphere, giving these prokaryotes a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause deleterious effects to water quality and reservoir ecosystem services. Although the structure of the plankton community in reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms is a well-known limnological issue, few studies have been undertaken on its functional characteristics. In this study, we used a high-resolution autonomous monitoring system to investigate the short-term changes in gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and community respiration (R) in the near-surface waters of a Mediterranean reservoir during a dense summer cyanobacterial bloom. Our results demonstrate that during the bloom, the surface waters of the reservoir showed a well-balanced planktonic metabolism, with a mean GPP:R ratio not significantly different than 1 and therefore close positive correlations between GPP and R. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the daily integrated incident light and the NEP:GPP ratio, while the mixed-layer depth and NEP:GPP ratio were negatively correlated, suggesting a central role for physical processes in the control of community metabolism and the persistence of the cyanobacterial bloom. The implications for the bloom stability and relevance for reservoir water quality management are noted.					; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; Escot, Carmelo/ABH-8609-2020	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Escot, Carmelo/0000-0002-5589-0579													0213-8409	1989-1806				JUN	2016	35	1					117	130																WOS:000379198200010

Here we present records of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca from precisely dated stalagmites from Baluk cave in Xinjiang (northwest China), spanning the past 9370 years. The co-variations of the trace element ratios, together with the slopes of the regression lines of the corresponding logarithmically transformed data, suggest that they are dominated by prior calcite precipitation (PCP) and thus can be used as reliable proxies of changes in moisture/precipitation. The trace element ratios are relatively high during 9 to 5 ka and lower from 5 ka to the present, indicating a trend of increasing mid-late Holocene moisture in ACA. The long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is correlative with two other records of speleothem trace element ratios from caves in ACA: Kesang cave (western Xinjiang) and Ton cave (Uzbekistan). This spatial coherency of the trend of inferred moisture conditions from three caves that are separated by hundreds of kilometers demonstrates that speleothem trace element ratios are indicative of large spatial scale rather than local hydroclimatic variability in ACA during the Holocene. However, the long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is the inverse of the corresponding oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records from the same cave sites, which implies that Holocene speleothem delta O-18 records do not represent changes in the precipitation amount in ACA; rather, they most likely reflect moisture sources and related water vapor transport controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI). Our findings provide new evidence for a 'westerlies-dominated climatic regime', which influenced hydroclimatic changes in ACA during the Holocene.

Zooplankton dynamics during autumn circulation in a small, wind-sheltered, Mediterranean lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Few studies have been undertaken on zooplankton dynamics during the transition from late stratification to early mixing in lakes. The Plankton Ecology Group ( PEG) model of plankton seasonality only considers water temperature, edible phytoplankton and fish predation as zooplankton-controlling factors during that period. The water-column edible algal and bacterial fractions, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were studied during 93 consecutive days of mixing-transition in a wind-sheltered, Mediterranean lake without planktivorous fish. Abundances of all zooplankton populations except ciliates, Daphnia longispina and copepodites, were related to water temperature. In addition to PEG controlling factors, time series analysis indicated competition between ciliates and Ceriodaphnia reticulata and Polyarthra dolichoptera and D. longispina, predation of Arctodiaptomus salinus on ciliates, herbivory of adult copepods on the 5-20 mu m phytoplanktonic size and delayed effects shorter than one week. The remaining zooplankton populations did not show any edible size preference. Ceriodaphnia reticulata showed evidence of herbivory on bacteria and picoplankton and competition with Hexarthra fennica in shorter periods. Phyto- and zooplankton production were decoupled. These results, and others from warmer periods and latitudes, suggest that the current model of lake plankton seasonality must be reviewed.

Sediment phosphorus release sustains nuisance periphyton growth when nitrogen is not limiting	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Nuisance periphyton growth influences the aesthetics, recreation, and aquatic life of waterbodies. Partners Lake is a shallow spring-fed lake in the headwaters of the Illinois River Watershed in Cave Springs, Arkansas, that experiences nuisance growth of periphyton (i.e., Spirogyra spp.) each year. The molar ratio of dissolved Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) in the lake water (N:P >= 285), as well as nutrient limitation assays, suggests that photoautotrophic growth should be P-limited. While the water column lacks sufficient P to promote phytoplankton growth, the sediments have the ability to release P to the overlying water; P-flux ranged from 1.63 mg m(-2) d(-1) to over 10 mg m(2) d(-1), reaching final P concentrations of 0.08 to 0.34 mg L-1 in the overlying water of the cores. Sediment P release is most likely the dominant source of P for periphyton growth; however, soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were consistently at or below 0.030 mg L-1 in the lake, suggesting that the periphyton were likely immobilizing P as quickly as it was released from the sediments. In the lab, maximal periphyton biomass (similar to 30 to 35 mg m(-2)) occurred in the 0.10 to 0.25 mg L-1 P treatments, over a 6-day incubation period. Similar levels of growth occurred when lake sediments were the P source, suggesting P released from the sediments is sufficient to support nuisance algal growth. We need to begin managing the legacy P stored in the sediments, in addition to external P loads, because internal P can sustain nuisance periphyton biomass when N is not limiting.

J	HUNT, TM; TOSHA, T				HUNT, TM; TOSHA, T			PRECISE GRAVITY MEASUREMENTS AT INFERNO CRATER, WAIMANGU, NEW-ZEALAND	GEOTHERMICS												Five precise gravity surveys have shown that the only significant gravity changes which occurred during a cycle of lake level fluctuation were at points within about 2 m of the edge of the lake. These data suggest that groundwater in the surrounding rocks is perturbed only within about 5 - 15 m of the lake edge. The mass of fluid which periodically overflows must come from deep (> 200 m) beneath the lake or outside its immediate vicinity.																			0375-6505					OCT-DEC	1994	23	5-6					573	582		10.1016/0375-6505(94)90020-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0375-6505(94)90020-5													WOS:A1994QG37600013

PS operations affect the water quality of the connected water bodies by exchanging water between them but also by deep water withdrawal from the upper water body. Here, we assess the importance of these two processes in the context of recommissioning a PS hydropower plant by simulating different scenarios with the numerical hydrodynamic and water quality model CE-QUAL-W2. For extended PS operations, the results show significant impacts of the water exchange between the two water bodies on the seasonal dynamics of temperatures, stratification, nutrients, and ice cover, especially in the smaller upper reservoir. Deep water withdrawal was shown to strongly decrease the strength of summer stratification in the upper reservoir, shortening its duration by similar to 1.5 months, consequently improving oxygen availability, and reducing the accumulation of nutrients in the hypolimnion. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the effects of different options for water withdrawal depths in the design of PS hydropower plants, as well as the relevance of defining a reference state when a PS facility is to be recommissioned.

A spring peak of D. ambigua occurred shortly after ice break-up. Decline of D. ambigua coincided with a high occurrence of sexual reproduction, the appearance of D. parvula which did not become abundant, and a substantial increase in Ceriodaphnia quadrangula. A 3rd cladoceran, Bosmina longirostris, was abundant before and after the period of numerical dominance by D. ambigua, but declined to very low numbers coincident with the increase in D. ambigua. Estimates of egg hatching rate at various temperatures demonstrate that these 3 cladocerans have different rate responses to temperature, and that seasonal succession of species is predictable from temperature alone. The importance of temperature versus species interactions in controlling species succession is discussed.

J	Külköylüoglu, O; Yilmaz, O				Kulkoyluoglu, Okan; Yilmaz, Ozan			Niche overlap and ecological tolerance of non-marine Ostracoda in Turkey	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												We applied niche overlap indices to for the first time show possible correlational occurrences among 40 non-marine ostracod taxa from seven aquatic habitats (lakes, creeks, ponds, springs, ditches, pools, troughs) in Turkey. Ecological tolerance and optimum estimates of each species were calculated and compared to explain possible reasons for habitat utilization. Eleven species were found suitable for the application of these indices. Overlap ranges of five of the species were found suitable for five variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and elevation; P < 0.05). Heterocypris incongruens (Ramdohr, 1808) and H. salina (Brady, 1868) were the only two species with common overlap for all the five variables. These two species generally showed common resource-utilization curves for each of these variables along with relatively similar tolerance ranges. Complete overlap was only possible for some cosmoecious species when they displayed wide-tolerance ranges and low optimum estimates for different environmental variables. Results suggest that cosmopolitan species do not only have wide geographical distributions but tolerance ranges higher than other species. Such wide tolerance ranges seem to help species coinhabit with each other and elevate their co-occurrence probabilities in different types of habitats. Applying the first usage of overlap indices on ostracods and attempting to show the relationship between niche overlap and species ecological tolerance could nevertheless provide a new tool to apply in future studies.

Size-mediated control of perch-midge coupling in Lake Erie transient dead zones	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Transient ecosystem-level disturbances such as oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in aquatic systems modulate species distributions and interactions. In highly eutrophic systems, hypoxic areas ("dead zones") have expanded around the world, temporarily preventing many demersal predators from accessing their food resources. Here, we investigate how yellow perch (Perca flavescens), an exploited, cool-water mesopredator, interact with their dominant invertebrate prey in benthic habitat-non-biting midge (chironomid) larvae-as bottom-water hypoxia develops in central Lake Erie (United States-Canada) during summer. We apply linear mixed-effects models to individual-level data from basin-wide field surveys on size-based interactions between perch and midge larvae under varying habitat conditions and resource attributes. We test if 1) midge populations (larval body size and density) differ among habitat states (unstratified normoxia, stratified normoxia, and stratified hypoxia); and 2) size-based perch-midge interactions (predator-prey mass ratio or PPMR) differ among habitat states with varying temperature and midge density. Midge populations remained highly abundant after bottom-water oxygen depletion. Despite their high densities, midge larvae also maintained their body size in hypoxic water. In contrast, perch on average consumed relatively smaller (by up to similar to 64%) midges (higher PPMR) in warmer and hypoxic water, while prey size ingested by perch shrunk less in areas with higher midge density. Our analysis shows that hypoxia-tolerant midges largely allow perch to maintain their consumer-resource relationships in contracted habitats through modified size-mediated interactions in dead zones during summer, revealing plasticity of their trophic coupling in the chronically perturbed ecosystem.					; Goto, Daisuke/F-7393-2013; Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; Goto, Daisuke/0000-0003-2668-1310; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2017	100	12					1587	1600		10.1007/s10641-017-0667-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0667-1													WOS:000417067100006

The fish are distributed in schools during the day and as scattered individual fish targets at night. Measurements of volume-backscattering strength and target strengths (TS) were carried out in a synchronous way using three echosounders operating at three frequencies (70, 120, and 129 kHz), with different characteristics (split beam, dual beam, beam shape, pulse length, etc.). Target-strength values show variability from one elementary sampling unit to another and from one device to another, but the mean global TS values are similar, independently of the frequency. The volume-backscattering strengths measured on precise schools by the three acoustic devices give significantly similar results. Acoustic measurements on YOY perch are completely independent of the frequency and the characteristics of the echosounders. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration ofthe Sea.

J	Yin, JN; Zhang, YC				Yin, Jingnan; Zhang, Yaocun			Decadal changes of East Asian jet streams and their relationship with the Mid-high Latitude Circulations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study investigates the concurrent location and intensity changes of the East Asian polar front jet (EAPJ) and subtropical jet (EASJ) on decadal time scale using NCEP/NCAR, ERA5 and JRA-55 reanalysis data, along with the relationship with the mid-high latitude circulation changes. Results show that EAPJ was intensified accompanied by the weakening of EASJ after 1985, and shifted equatorward in conjunction with the poleward migration of EASJ after 1999. The three-dimensional structures of the atmospheric circulation over East Asia exhibited distinct changes corresponding to the two regime shifts. Dipole anomalous sea level pressure (SLP) between the Arctic and the North Pacific, a NAM-like geopotential height anomalous pattern, and a deepened polar vortex occurred after 1985, accompanied with the out-of-phase intensity changes of the two jets. In comparison, dipole SLP anomalies between the mid-high latitudes and Tibetan Plateau, a zonal wave train over Eurasia accompanied with a meridional wave train over East Asia, and a polar vortex shifting toward the Siberia were observed after 1999, when the two jets approached each other. These circulation changes exerted pronounced effects on the East Asian climate anomalies. After the mid-1980s, the positive SLP anomaly over the northern North Pacific led to decreased land-sea SLP contrast, and the positive mid-tropospheric geopotential height center near Lake Baikal implied weakened East Asian trough (EAT). Such changes favored the warming of southern East Asia and the weakening of the southern mode of East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In contrast, the high latitude positive SLP anomalies denoted enhanced Siberian high (SH) and the East Asian meridional wave train resulted in tilted EAT after the late 1990s, benefitting the cold anomalies over northern Eurasia with the northern mode of EAWM intensified. Possible mechanisms for the decadal changes of the jets are discussed from the perspective of the dynamic forcing of the synoptic-scale transient eddy activities (STEA), and the thermal forcings from the East Asian landmass, the North Pacific sea surface and the Arctic sea ice cover.

J	Gido, KB				Gido, KB			Feeding ecology of three omnivorous fishes in Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Feeding ecology of 3 omnivorous fishes in a large southern United States reservoir was investigated to develop hypotheses on the potential functional roles of these species in this ecosystem. I examined distribution, abundance, and diet of smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus), river carpsucker (Carpiodes carpio), and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepadianum) relative to the availability of potential resources during summer 1997 and 1998. In July and August, abundance of smallmouth buffalo was significantly greater at stations with depths of 10 m than at 1 m or 3 m stations. There was no significant difference in abundance of gizzard shad or river carpsucker by depth or month. Relative proportions of detritus and zooplankton in the diet varied among species. Smallmouth buffalo primarily ate copepods, whereas gizzard shad primarily ate detritus. The diet of river carpsucker was intermediate in relative proportions of zooplankton and detritus to that of smallmouth buffalo and gizzard shad. Of the 3 species examined, only gizzard shad showed a significant decline in dietary crude protein, phosphorus, and organic content over the summer. This corresponded to a decline in condition of gizzard shad. Overall, benthic invertebrates had a heterogeneous distribution within the reservoir, and organic content of sediments was not different across sample stations. Relative importance to ecosystem functioning of these species, all of which are highly abundant in southern reservoirs, likely depends on species-specific feeding ecology and environmental conditions.

J	CUKER, BE; MOZLEY, SC				CUKER, BE; MOZLEY, SC			SUMMER POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS, FEEDING, AND GROWTH OF HYDRA IN AN ARCTIC LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												During 1977, the population density of Hydra in the rocky littoral community in Toolik Lake, Alaska [USA], increased from June to a maximum in late July or early Aug., then remained stable or decreased slightly through late Aug. The summer increase of Hydra corresponded to increases in the availability of copepods and Bosmina (the preferred prey) until late July. Hydra kept at lake temperatures in the laboratory with unlimited prey reproduced fast enough asexually to account for these increases: at 19.degree. C the intrinsic rate of increase (r, biomass) was 0.53 g .cntdot. g-1 day-1, and at 11.degree. C, r = 0.31 day-1. These rates, much higher than those for other Hydra at comparable temperatures, seem to be a metabolic adaptation to arctic conditions. Failure of the Hydra population to continue to increase while food resources increased in Aug. is attributed to predation by Lymnaea, displacement by epilithic algal growth, endogenously controlled emigration from the rock littoral, or some combination of these. Hydra appears to be the most important predator on Bosmina. Hydra at densities of 135 .cntdot. m-2 on the rocky shoals could take 1620 Bosmina .cntdot. m-2 day-1 during late July and early Aug. 1977, .apprx. 10%/day consumption of the estimated lake standing crop of Bosmina. This is the 1st evidence that Hydra plays a major role in controlling a prey population.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1981	26	4					697	708		10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0697	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0697													WOS:A1981MB81000009

Trends in Lake Erie zooplankton biomass and community structure during a 25-year period of rapid environmental change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zooplankton play a key role in aquatic ecosystems, providing potential top-down control on phytoplank-ton and linking primary production to higher trophic levels. Thus, knowledge of zooplankton dynamics is fundamental to any assessment of the impacts of human driven rapid environmental change on lakes. Lake Erie has undergone eutrophication since the 1990s, resulting in summer harmful cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa, since approximately 2003 in the western basin (WB) and 2008 in the central basin (CB). The effect of eutrophication on zooplankton in Lake Erie is unclear; few studies have characterized trends in zooplankton biomass and community structure during this period of rapid change. We used the Lake Erie Plankton Abundance Study (LEPAS) zooplankton dataset to ana-lyze interannual trends in the dynamics of eight major zooplankton groups in the WB and CB during 1995-2020. In both basins, we found directional change in zooplankton biomass and community struc-ture. These directional trends in zooplankton biomass overlaid approximate five-year cycles in nearly all taxa, potentially linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Eutrophication was associated with an increase in the summer biomass of total zooplankton, calanoids, and large cladocerans but surprisingly, not cyclopoids, rotifers or small cladocerans. The surprisingly positive or neutral effect of eutrophication and M. aeruginosa on zooplankton biomass may be due to a combination of bottom-up (e.g. concurrent increases in more edible algae) and top-down (e.g. changes in planktivory) forces.(c) 2023 The Authors.

The fluctuation of lithogenic element concentration in the lake sediments can readily be explained by a particle sorting effect induced by the Asian monsoon. The variation of atmospheric deposition of Cu and Pb shows a similar profile in the lower part of the core sediments, and coincides with environmental change, with high atmospheric deposition coupled with wet, temperate period; while low deposition with dry, cold period, indicating a transport variation of heavy metal pollutants entrained by the Asian summer monsoon. From the beginning of nineteenth century, the atmospheric deposition of Cu and Pb decreased and then slowly increased. This may be associated with the destroyed industry induced by long-term wars in China and the less heavy metal pollutants relative to the weak Asian summer monsoon in this period. Comparison between atmospheric-derived metal and sediment trap metal using Ga as the reference element shows that atmospheric Cu and Pb budgets do not exceed the fluvially-induced Cu and Pb budgets in the indirectly disturbed area. On average, there have been approximately 5.4 mg m(-2) yr(-1) of Cu and 5.1 mg m(-2) yr(-1) of Pb atmospherically deposited in the region.

The total volume of crude oil that was spilled in the project area was estimated be over 1 million barrels. The spills created the threat that a large volume of this oil could be transported by a series of tributaries to the nearby Kolva River and then into the Pechora River. The Pechora drains through a populated region into the Arctic Ocean and is important as a regional waterway, and in terms of ecology, fishing, potable water, and other human use activities. The first phase of the project, initiated to contain the spilled oil, was completed in May 1995. Attention was then focused on the removal of gross concentrations of mobile oil that could be washed to the rivers by future stream flow and floods. The removal activities were conducted in a wide range of upland, lowland, and stream terrain types and a number of different terrain-specific treatment techniques were developed. The construction of dams across the streams and the consequent creation of temporary lakes resulted in increases in localized stream bank and floodplain oiling conditions, in addition to the damage resulting from the construction activities. Although the treatment techniques used by the management team were developed based upon minimizing damages, alternative techniques employed by other parties resulted in extreme damages as well as inefficient removal. Support activities (e.g., roads and borrow pits) also resulted in damages in some areas. However, if these bulk concentrations had not been removed, the large volumes of viscous oil would have degraded and weathered only very slowly with a consequent long-term (decades) effect on the habitats. The choice facing the management team was either to remove the oil and accept the local effects of those actions or to risk the remobilization of the oil and the associated off-site damage in the Kolva and Pechora Rivers. The project is described in the context of the regional and site-specific response objectives and strategies, the trade-offs that were made, the consequences of the management decisions, and in terms of the Net Environmental Benefit of the response actions.																									1997							389	413																WOS:000085691200023
J	Zeman-Kuhnert, S; Thiel, V; Heim, C				Zeman-Kuhnert, Sebastian; Thiel, Volker; Heim, Christine			Effects of Weather Extremes on the Nutrient Dynamics of a Shallow Eutrophic Lake as Observed during a Three-Year Monitoring Study	WATER												The formation of algal and cyanobacterial blooms caused by the eutrophication of water bodies is a growing global concern. To examine the impact of extreme weather events on blooms, eutrophication-related parameters (e.g., water temperature, nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP)) were quantitatively assessed monthly over three years (2017-2019) at Lake Seeburg (Central Germany), a shallow eutrophic lake with regular cyanobacterial blooms. In addition, SRP concentrations in sediment pore water were assessed monthly for one year (2018). The monitoring period included a three-day extremely heavy rain event in 2017 as well as a severe drought in summer 2018. No such extreme weather conditions occurred in 2019. After the heavy rain event in 2017, anoxic water containing high levels of ammonium and SRP entered the lake from flooded upstream wetlands. This external nutrient spike resulted in a heavy but short (3 weeks) and monospecific cyanobacterial bloom. A different situation occurred during the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 2018. Especially favored by high water temperatures, SRP concentrations in sediment pore waters gradually increased to extreme levels (34.4 mg/L). This resulted in a strong and sustained internal SRP delivery into the water column (69 mg/m(2)center dot d(-1)), which supported the longest-lasting cyanobacterial bloom (3 months) within the three-year monitoring period. Subsequent biomass decay led to oxygen-depleted conditions in the bottom waters, elevated ammonium, and, later, nitrate concentrations. Our observations demonstrate the particular effects of extreme weather events on nutrient dynamics and the phytoplankton composition in the lake. As the frequency and intensity of such events will likely increase due to climate change, their impacts need to be increasingly considered, e.g., in future remediation strategies.

A study of the diet of roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) in the lake of Pareloup (Massif Central, France)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The diet preferences of roach in the lake of Pareloup have been determined by analyses of their gut contents from January to July 1990. Changes in the food composition have been established by using a weight index that illustrates a hierarchy of prey in relation to the season. These analyses show that roach in the size range 10-21 cm have a diet of chiefly detritus and zooplankton whilst the oldest individuals are detritivores. There is a seasonal variation in the roach diet : detritus dominates in winter, it is replaced progressively by zooplankton (Cladocera) and, in lesser quantity, by macroinvertebrates (Chironomidae) from March. Phytoplankton (diatoms) are ingested in large quantities, but their contribution in terms of weight of food is always small. The roach of Pareloup fed actively throughout the study period and in a rather opportune way.																			0003-4088	2100-000X				JAN	1992	28	3					245	252		10.1051/limn/1992021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1992021													WOS:000208073500006
J	Liu, L; You, XY				Liu, Lei; You, Xue-yi			Study of water quality response to water transfer patterns in the receiving basin and surrogate model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The spatio-temporal response of water quality in the receiving basins to water transfer remains unclear when considering more practical factors. Moreover, a much fast surrogate model is highly required to realize the purpose of rapid prediction of water quality. In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was primarily established by considering the most comprehensive important pollution sources so far to investigate the water quality variation in Baiyangdian Lake, China. The pollution sources include atmospheric deposition, sediment release, village and tourism domestic sewage, livestock breeding, rainfall runoff, aquatic plants, and animals. The water quality at different sample sites was assessed using the water quality index (WQI). Subsequently, a surrogate model was proposed using the nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), and the NARX model can realize fast prediction of the annual time series of water quality in a few seconds. The results showed that there are significant differences in water quality at different sample sites in each season. The highest WQI value occurred in autumn (65.46), and the average values at different sample sites were between 47.54 and 58.22 in this season. The water quality at Nanliuzhuang site and Caiputai site was significantly affected by water transfer patterns. In addition, the correlation coefficient R-2 between the predicted results and the simulated ones except that of parameter TP was larger than 0.90. The prediction performance of surrogate model was shown to be very high efficiency and accurate. The proposed models and the results of this approach are guiding significance for lake management.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2022	29	17					24774	24792		10.1007/s11356-021-17469-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17469-4		NOV 2021						34826074					WOS:000722824700007

The control sill for Lake Erie levels was at first the Fort Erie/Buffalo sill, before the Lyell/Johnson sill in Niagara Falls took over due to isostatic rebound. This sill, in time, was eventually eroded by the recession of Niagara Falls and the Fort Erie/Buffalo sill regained control. The environmental picture is complicated by catastrophic outbursts from glacial Lake Agassiz and Lake Barlow-Ojibway, changes in outlet routes, isostatic rebound and climatic changes over the Great Lakes basins. Today, the flow of water into Lake Erie from the streams and rivers surrounding it only accounts for about 13% of the flow out of it, therefore, the importance of flow from the Upper Great Lakes, specifically the flow from Lake Huron, has a great effect on Lake Erie levels. While the changing control sills, Lyell/Johnson and Buffalo/Fort Erie would affect Lake Erie levels, overall they are mostly input driven by the amount of waters received from the Upper Great Lakes. Since Lake Erie's water level changes are so closely tied to Lake Huron's water level changes we have decided to use names assigned to Lake Huron such as the two Mattawa highstands and three Stanley lowstands rather than inflict a whole new set of names on the public. While the duration of each high and lowstand in Erie and Huron may not always be the same, they always happen within the same time frame. The datum elevations used for Lake Huron (175.8 m) and Lake Erie (173.3 m) are historically recorded averages. The Lake Erie levels proposed in this paper reflect Lake Hurons effects on Lake Erie and the levels occuring at the eastern end of the Erie Basin throughout the last 12 600 years. All dates in this paper are uncorrected C-14 dates unless the date was obtained from shells, then the date has been corrected for hard-water effects. Also, all heights are given as modern day elevations and are not adjusted for isostatic rebound.																			0921-2728					MAY	1997	17	4					377	402																WOS:A1997XH70900003
J	STAUFFER, RE; CANFIELD, DE				STAUFFER, RE; CANFIELD, DE			HYDROLOGY AND ALKALINITY REGULATION OF SOFT FLORIDA WATERS - AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Natural waters in ridge provinces of Florida and southeast Georgia were classified geographically, by degrees of cultural disturbance. and according to the dominant hydrologic and biogeochemical processes controlling chemistry. The ionic composition of lakes, upland streams, and surficial aquifer (water table) springs in relatively undeveloped catchments reflects the geographic variations in bulk deposition corrected for evapotranspiration (Na, Cl), plus a slight gain (net watershed mobilization) of Mg, and partial to nearly complete losses (net retention) of nitrate, sulfate, Ca, and K. Recharge to the Floridan aquifer in infertile, forested. sandy ridge provinces of northern Florida contains 360-580-mu-mol CO2. On the basis of indirect geochemical evidence, sulfate retention appears less important in lake sediments than in the region's highly weathered, ferruginous, kaolinitic, sand soils. Silica concentrations in upland streams and water table springs closely reflect the predicted equilibrium between kaolinite and gibbsite. Along with other evidence, the Si concentrations in ridge lakes indicate that seepage inflow is much more important than assumed in Baker et al.'s (1988) regional model. Lakes and streams are acidified either by humic acids or nonmarine sulfate but rarely by both, as reflected by the significant inverse correlation between these two components. Contrary to previous reports, there is no significant difference in alkalinity for culturally undisturbed lakes in the northern Trail versus southern Highlands Ridge areas.																			0043-1397					JUN	1992	28	6					1631	1648		10.1029/92WR00360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92WR00360													WOS:A1992HX30900012

Fluctuations in the lake level were mostly driven by the intensification of climatic oscillations (wet periods during North Atlantic Oscillation intervals and summer drought during Azores High intervals) and anthropogenic influences (e.g. the extraction of drinking water). The anthropogenic impact of local deforestation is encountered, associated with a peak in phosphorous in the deeper parts of the lake cores. As a consequence of these impacts ten diatom abundance zones (DZs) and the water/sediment interface (WSI) were recorded from the deeper core (CS-51) and two from the shallower (CS-52) core, along with the WSI, based on which an abrupt fluctuation in the level of the lake was interpreted. A dominance of Epithemia adnata in the deeper core, and Gomphonema pumilum in the CS-51, and in the CS-52 indicated a shallow phase connected with the summer drought recorded in the lake. A dominance of Amphora inariensis, Pseudostaurosira spp., Cyclotella spp. and Pantocsekiella ocellata in the rest of the cores indicated deeper, more alkaline lake conditions during the wet periods. The DZs accord with depth variations in Adriatic coastal lakes that are key sites of more extreme recent changes in the local climate.

J	Horne, BD; Rutherford, ES; Wehrly, KE				Horne, BD; Rutherford, ES; Wehrly, KE			Simulating effects of hydro-dam alteration on thermal regime and wild steelhead recruitment in a stable-flow Lake Michigan tributary	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Hydroelectric dams may affect anadromous fish survival and recruitment by limiting access to upstream habitats and adversely affecting quality of downstream habitats. In the Manistee River, a tributary to Lake Michigan, two hydroelectric dams potentially limit recruitment of anadromous rainbow,trout (steelhead) by increasing tailrace water temperatures to levels that significantly reduce survival of young-of-year (YOY) fish. The objectives of this study were to determine whether proposed restoration scenarios (dam removals or a bottom withdrawal retrofit) would alter the Manistee River thermal regime and, consequently, improve wild steelhead survival and recruitment. Physical process models were used to predict Manistee River thermal regimes following each dam alteration scenario. Empirical relationships were derived from historical field surveys to quantify the effect of temperature on YOY production and potential recruitment of Manistee River steelhead. Both dam alteration scenarios lowered summer temperatures and increased steelhead recruitment by between 59% and 129%, but total recruitments were still low compared to other Great Lakes tributaries. Considering only temperature effects, bottom withdrawal provides the greatest promise for increasing natural steelhead recruitment by decreasing the likelihood of year-class failures in the warmest summers. Results of this study may allow managers to evaluate mitigation alternatives for Manistee River dams during future relicensing negotiations, and illustrate the utility of physical process. temperature models in groundwater-fed rivers.

J	Brümmer, B; Pohlmann, S				Brümmer, B; Pohlmann, S			Wintertime roll and cell convection over Greenland and Barents Sea regions: A climatology	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Wintertime cold-air outbreaks from the polar ice and land surfaces over the open sea lead to organized convective patterns (OCP) in the atmosphere, visible as cloud streets and cellular cloud structures on satellite images. Large amounts of energy are transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere and convective organized flows contribute substantially to the vertical fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum in the boundary layer. However, little is known about the frequency of OCP occurrence. The paper is aimed to fill this gap and presents a climatology of OCP occurrence over the Greenland Sea and Barents Sea. The study is based on daily NOAA satellite images of 10 winters (November till March) for the years from 1985/1986 to 199411995. It covers the area from 70 degrees N to 82.5 degrees N and from 20 degrees W to 60 degrees E and is subdivided into 40 subareas with a grid size of 10 degrees in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude. OCP occur in more than 50 % of the time averaged over the 10 winters. Complete absence of OCP is observed in less than 5 % of the time. OCP occur most frequently over the Westspits-bergen current and around the border between the Greenland Sea and the Barents Sea. Cloud streets are the dominating OCP mode close to the ice edge, whereas cellular structures dominate at farther distances. Variability of OCP occurrence may be large on all timescales. A relation between ice extent and frequenzcy of OCP occurrence is present occasionally.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2000	105	D12					15559	15566		10.1029/1999JD900841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999JD900841													WOS:000087844900030

Estimating supraglacial lake depth in West Greenland using Landsat 8 and comparison with other multispectral methods	CRYOSPHERE												Liquid water stored on the surface of ice sheets and glaciers impacts surface mass balance, ice dynamics, and heat transport. Multispectral remote sensing can be used to detect supraglacial lakes and estimate their depth and area. In this study, we use in situ spectral and bathymetric data to assess lake depth retrieval using the recently launched Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We also extend our analysis to other multispectral sensors to evaluate their performance with similar methods. Digital elevation models derived from WorldView stereo imagery (pre-lake filling and post-drainage) are used to validate spectrally derived depths, combined with a lake edge determination from imagery. The optimal supraglacial lake depth retrieval is a physically based single-band model applied to two OLI bands independently (red and panchromatic) that are then averaged together. When OLI- and WorldView-derived depths are differenced, they yield a mean and standard deviation of 0.0 +/- 1.6 m. This method is then applied to OLI data for the Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbrae) region of Greenland to study the spatial and intra-seasonal variability of supraglacial lakes during summer 2014. We also give coefficients for estimating supraglacial lake depth using a similar method with other multispectral sensors.					; Moussavi, Mahsa/B-4051-2016; Grigsby, Shane/ACH-9177-2022; Scambos, Ted/B-1856-2009	Shean, David/0000-0003-3840-3860; Pope, Allen/0000-0001-9699-7500; Grigsby, Shane/0000-0003-4904-7785; SCAMBOS, Ted A./0000-0003-4268-6322													1994-0416	1994-0424					2016	10	1					15	27		10.5194/tc-10-15-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-15-2016													WOS:000377602600002

In this study, temperature functions of embryonic development time (EDT) were determined in the copepod Eodiaptomus japonicus from Lake Biwa, in the cold and warm seasons, to clarify synergistic effects of egg size and temperature on EDT. EDT was longer for cold season eggs than warm ones, but both seasons were well fitted by Belehradek's function. Egg size was significantly correlated with female body size within seasons, but the relationship did not differ significantly between seasons. These results suggest that seasonal variation in EDT, which was associated with egg size, may result from temperature-mediated variation of female body size, because larger females produced larger eggs as temperature decreased. Larger eggs may enhance fitness under severe food conditions in winter due to high hatchability and naupliar survival.

Cosmogenic Be-10 concentrations measured in modern river sands have been used to estimate 10(2)- to 10(4)-year sediment fluxes in these types of catchments, where upstream drainage areas are often in excess of 10 000 km(2). It is commonly assumed that within large catchments, the effects of stochastic sediment inputs are buffered such that Be-10 concentrations at the catchment outlet are relatively stable in time. We present 18 new Be-10 concentrations of modern river and dated Holocene terrace and floodplain deposits from the Ganga River near to the Himalayan mountain front (or outlet). We demonstrate that Be-10 concentrations measured in modern Ganga River sediments display a notable degree of variability, with concentrations ranging between similar to 9000 and 19 000 atoms g(-1). We propose that this observed variability is driven by two factors. Firstly, by the nature of stochastic inputs of sediment (e.g. the dominant erosional process, surface production rates, depth of landsliding, degree of mixing) and, secondly, by the evacuation timescale of individual sediment deposits which buffer their impact on catchment-averaged concentrations. Despite intensification of the Indian Summer Monsoon and subsequent doubling of sediment delivery to the Bay of Bengal between similar to 11 and 7 ka, we also find that Holocene sediment Be-10 concentrations documented at the Ganga outlet have remained within the variability of modern river concentrations. We demonstrate that, in certain systems, sediment flux cannot be simply approximated by converting detrital concentration into mean erosion rates and multiplying by catchment area as it is possible to generate larger volumetric sediment fluxes whilst maintaining comparable average Be-10 concentrations.

After harvest of planted agricultural areas around the wetlands, reed fires were set by shepherds who graze animals through there. Fires were seen most frequently at Lake Norsin. Although, most of reeds through in. shore of Lake Norsin were damaged, reeds on island in center of the lake were not affected by fires. Due to distance of Lake Arin to settlements, reed fires were seen seldomly there.																			1680-5593	1993-601X					2013	12	1					58	61																WOS:000321389100012

The BNL was enriched in tert-PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl], p,p''-DDE and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) but deficient in dissolved organic carbon relative to surface waters. Resuspension events in midsummer resulted in a 50% increase in the PCB burden in the water column. Seasonal cycling of PCB congeners was strongly dependent on their degree of chlorination, with heavier chlorinated congeners lost from the water column (t1/2 [half-life] = 17-28 days at 2 sites). Steady-state tert-PCB concentrations in the BNL were maintained over the summer by transport of lighter chlorinated congeners from the underlying sediments. DDE was an effective tracer of sediment resuspension in Lake Superior. Recycling of trace organic pollutants in the BNL served to increase their residence times in the lake.

J	Kishel, HF; Gerla, PJ				Kishel, HF; Gerla, PJ			Characteristics of preferential flow and groundwater discharge to Shingobee Lake, Minnesota, USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Small-scale heterogeneities and large changes in hydraulic gradient over short distances can create preferential groundwater flow paths that discharge to lakes. A 170 m 2 and within an area of springs and seeps along the shore of Shingobee Lake, Minnesota, was intensively instrumented to characterize groundwater-lake interaction within underlying organic-rich soil and sandy glacial sediments. Seepage meters in the lake and piezometer nests, installed at depths of 0.5 and 1.0 m below the ground surface and lakebed, were used to estimate groundwater flow. Statistical analysis of hydraulic conductivity estimated from slug tests indicated a range from 21 to 4.8 x 10(-3) m day(-1) and small spatial correlation. Although hydraulic gradients are overall upward and toward the lake, surface water that flows onto an area about 2 m onshore results in downward flow and localized recharge. Most flow occurred within 3 m of the shore through more permeable pathways. Seepage meter and Darcy law estimates of groundwater discharge agreed well within error limits. In the small area examined, discharge decreases irregularly with distance into the lake, indicating that sediment heterogeneity plays an important role in the distribution of groundwater discharge. Temperature gradients showed some relationship to discharge, but neither temperature profiles nor specific electrical conductance could provide a more convenient method to map groundwater-lake interaction. These results suggest that site-specific data may be needed to evaluate local water budget and to protect the water quality and quantity of discharge-dominated lakes.

This study investigated the possible effects of the colony's excreta on the mass, nitrogen (N) content, and decomposition of woody debris. Study plots were established in forest stands representing four stages from breeding colony establishment to post-abandonment. The mass of fallen branches (diameter 1-5 cm) and coarse woody debris (logs, snags, and stumps; diameter >= 10 cm) was greater in forest stands colonized by Cormorants than a control stand never colonized by Cormorants. This was primarily attributed to Cormorant activity that caused increased mortality of standing trees and by Cormorants breaking branches for nesting materials. Nitrogen content of branches and logs that had fallen to the forest floor was negatively correlated with the relative density of wood. Nitrogen content of branches was consistently higher (at a given value of relative density) in the colonized stands than in the control stand. The increase of branch N content was possibly caused by the incorporation of N into decomposing branches with excreta-derived N supplied as throughfall and/or soil solution. The mean value of 2-year mass loss of recently dead branches and logs was significantly greater for woody debris in the smallest diameter class but was not significantly different among the forest stands. This suggests that the excessive supply of excreta-derived N and concomitant enrichment of N in soil had negligible effects on the initial stages of decomposition of woody debris.

We established an EASM record in the Late Miocene from lacustrine sediments in the Qaidam Basin, northern China, which appears to exhibit a dominant 100-ky periodicity similar to the EASM records during the Late Quaternary. Because evidence suggests that partial or ephemeral ice existed in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Miocene, we attribute the 100-ky cycles to CO2 and Southern Hemisphere insolation-driven Antarctic ice sheet forcing. This indicates a >6-million year earlier onset of the dominant 100-ky Asian monsoon and, likely, glacial and CO2 cycles and may indicate dominant forcing of Northern Hemisphere climate by CO2 and Southern Hemisphere ice sheets in a warm world.					; Necula, Cristian/C-1063-2015; Liu, Qingsong/AAK-4672-2020; Song, yougui/I-8813-2014; Nie, Junsheng/E-5047-2010; Su, Qingda/KIH-2636-2024; Zhang, Shihong/G-8926-2013; Heslop, David/G-6412-2011; Song, Yougui/I-8813-2014	Nie, Junsheng/0000-0002-1700-7116; Heslop, David/0000-0001-8245-0555; Song, Yougui/0000-0003-0064-3260													2375-2548					MAR	2017	3	3							e1600762	10.1126/sciadv.1600762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1600762								28435857					WOS:000416722700003

Data from both surface monitoring and field survey at the dry-up bottom of Aiby Lake present that clay-rich lacustrine deposits are easily broken down and eroded away by wind in the seasonal alternation process under the natural and environment, and are the significant source of air dust. The surface of the clay-rich deposits is broken and softened by the freezing-and-thawing action in winter season and/or by salt and alkali action with precipitation. Impact of wind-input particles and plow of plant branches with wind force drive the clay-rich sediments moving. Wind picks up the clay pebbles and repeats the impaction further-ward onto the dry-up surface. Tremendous fine materials, including soft salts, are contributed to air dust, and transported in long distance.																			1006-9313					DEC	2002	45			D			157	164		10.1007/BF02878403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02878403													WOS:000182514600022
J	SHIOZAWA, DK; BARNES, JR				SHIOZAWA, DK; BARNES, JR			MICRODISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION TRENDS OF LARVAL TANYPUS-STELLATUS COQUILLETT AND CHIRONOMUS-FROMMERI ATCHLEY AND MARTIN (DIPTERA-CHIRONOMIDAE) IN UTAH LAKE, UTAH	ECOLOGY												The microdistributional patterns and life histories of larval T. stellatus and C. frommeri were studied in Goshen Bay of Utah Lake, Utah [USA], from July 1973-Aug. 1974. Vertical distribution data showed that over 90% of the larvae were located in the top 7.5 cm of the substratum. Depth of penetration into the substratum increased with the later instars. C. frommeri larvae penetrated deeper than those of T. stellatus. Biomass was distributed bimodally. The mode at the 0-2.5-cm depth was due to high numbers of early instar larvae. The 2nd mode, at the 17.5-20.0-cm depth was due to the presence of 4th instar C. frommeri larvae. T. stellatus showed a contagious distribution in the early instars with a trend towards randomization with age. Larvae of C. frommeri rarely showed contagious distributions. This was likely related to their low abundance in the samples making detection of a contagious distribution difficult. The larvae of T. stellatus overwintered in the 1st and 2nd instar. This overwintering generation emerged in early July and gave rise to a 2nd summer generation which emerged in Aug. C. frommeri overwinter mainly as 3rd and 4th instar larvae. Emergence occurred throughout the summer although 2 strong emergence pulses were seen, 1 in May and the 2nd in July-Aug.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1977	58	3					610	618		10.2307/1939010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939010													WOS:A1977DR20800013
J	Millerd, F				Millerd, Frank			The potential impact of climate change on Great Lakes international shipping	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The higher temperatures of climate change may result in a fall in Great Lakes water levels. For vessels carrying imports into and exports out of the Great Lakes lower lake levels will lead to restrictions on vessel drafts and reductions in vessel cargos, increasing the number of trips and the cost of moving cargo. Estimates of these impacts are derived from simulations of a recent year's international cargo movements, comparing a base case with no climate change to various climate change scenarios. The impacts vary from a 5% increase in vessel variable operating costs for a climate change scenario representing the possible climate in 2030 to over 22% for a scenario representing a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Impacts vary by commodity and route. For years of naturally occurring low water the impacts are up to 13% higher for even the most moderate climate change scenario. Climate change may also result in a shorter time of ice cover leading to an extension of the navigation season. Climate change is also expected to increase the threat of damage from aquatic invasive species, possibly leading to further requirements for ships to undertake preventive measures.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				FEB	2011	104	3-4					629	652		10.1007/s10584-010-9872-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9872-z													WOS:000286204300011

The geochemical and petrochemical characteristics of the Rila massif are well-suited to study the relative significance of different weathering mechanisms occurring along the year in a mountain aquatic system. In such an area the atmospheric input contribution to the surface water quality could be assessed. A first sampling survey in summer-time allowed us to get some data on major and minor elements in the soluble phase. The results show that the Iskar upper watershed is well-suited because of no mixing with long residence time groundwaters and of the low population density which results in insignificant anthropic input.

One example is the creation of natural protected areas in zones of predominantly private property, giving them exclusive rights and increasing real estate values and investments in tourism. As a result, tourist paradises have sprung up in places of high biodiversity, offering exclusivity to their owners and clients while violating agrarian rights, creating social conflict, and destroying ecosystems.

We hypothesized that deeper peat historically existing beneath the water table would produce significant CO2 efflux during summer droughts. To test this hypothesis, we collected saturated peat cores, partitioned them into depth intervals, incubated the peat under conditions that resulted in peat drying, and monitored daily CO2 production together with potential drivers of CO2 production, including peat quality, microbial biomass, and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. Peat CO2 production (mu mol CO2 min(-1) g(-1) dry soil) was highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile, with the highest production at intermediate volumetric water content (VWC). Peat substrates fuelling CO2 production had quotients of C to N of <20 and were characterized by more labile forms of C. Microbial biomass C (mg C g(-1) dry soil) and most microbial extracellular enzymes (nmol g(-1) h(-1)) were also highest in the top 30 cm of the peat profile. Activities of microbial extracellular enzymes shifted in their contribution to CO2 production as the peat dried, with hydrolases positively related to CO2 under dry conditions (5-35%) and negatively under wet conditions (65 and 85%), with phenol oxidase showing the opposite pattern. Currently, the relatively poor quality (i.e., high C/N) of peat in catotelm limits rapid release of CO2 with water table declines. However, this substantial C store may be vulnerable to decomposition if constraints on quality are alleviated.

J	Mironov, D; Ritter, B; Schulz, JP; Buchhold, M; Lange, M; Machulskaya, E				Mironov, Dmitrii; Ritter, Bodo; Schulz, Jan-Peter; Buchhold, Michael; Lange, Martin; Machulskaya, Ekaterina			Parameterisation of sea and lake ice in numerical weather prediction models of the German Weather Service	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A bulk thermodynamic (no rheology) sea-ice parameterisation scheme for use in numerical weather prediction (NWP) is presented. The scheme is based on a self-similar parametric representation (assumed shape) of the evolving temperature profile within the ice and on the integral heat budget of the ice slab. The scheme carries ordinary differential equations (in time) for the ice surface temperature and the ice thickness. The proposed sea-ice scheme is implemented into the NWP models GME (global) and COSMO (limited-area) of the German Weather Service. In the present operational configuration, the horizontal distribution of the sea ice is governed by the data assimilation scheme, no fractional ice cover within the GME/COSMO grid box is considered, and the effect of snow above the ice is accounted for through an empirical temperature dependence of the ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation. The lake ice is treated similarly to the sea ice, except that freeze-up and break-up of lakes occurs freely, independent of the data assimilation. The sea and lake ice schemes (the latter is a part of the fresh-water lake parameterisation scheme FLake) show a satisfactory performance in GME and COSMO. The ice characteristics are not overly sensitive to the details of the treatment of heat transfer through the ice layer. This justifies the use of a simplified but computationally efficient bulk approach to model the ice thermodynamics in NWP, where the ice surface temperature is a major concern whereas details of the temperature distribution within the ice are of secondary importance. In contrast to the details of the heat transfer through the ice, the cloud cover is of decisive importance for the ice temperature as it controls the radiation energy budget at the ice surface. This is particularly true for winter, when the long-wave radiation dominates the surface energy budget. During summer, the surface energy budget is also sensitive to the grid-box mean ice surface albedo with respect to solar radiation. Considering the crucial importance of the surface radiation budget, future efforts should go into the development of a refined formulation of the grid-box mean surface albedo, including the albedo of ice itself and the fractional ice cover. NWP models may also benefit from an explicit treatment of snow above the ice. As the results from single-column experiments suggest, a bulk snow parameterisation holds promise but improved formulations of the snow density and the snow temperature conductivity are required.

The proportion of different items was assessed through analysis of gut contents in order to establish differences and similarities between the phenotypes. In addition, temporal changes through the growing season, the influence of fish weight on proportion of main items ingested and the relationship between gut content and natural food availability was also assessed. The results showed no difference in feeding behaviour between minor and scaly carp, the two phenotypes displaying a diet overlap of around 0.8. A shift in food resources from benthic to planktonic organisms was observed between early and late summer, which was reflected in changes in electivity index for some taxa. Fish weight did not influence the proportion of organisms ingested. No correlation was found between natural food in the pond and that in the gut, any variation in diet probably reflecting the microhabitats in which individual carp choose to feed.

WATER ECOLOGICAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF THE MULING RIVER BASIN BASED ON ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS IN NORTHEAST CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In order to explore the water ecological health of the Muling River, the largest tributary of Wusuli River in northeast China The environmental factors and aquatic organisms of the Muling River were investigated in different seasons. During the investigation, 83 species and 17 functional groups of phytoplankton, and 36 species and seven functional groups of zooplankton, and 158 genera/species and six functional feending groups of macroinvertebrates, and 46 species and seven fish functional groups were found. The evaluation system of water ecological health in the Muling River Basin, including 27 indexes, was established by analytic hierarchy process by calculating, which values in each season were 0.4177, 0.4428, 0.5071, 0.4699, 0.4799 and 0.6434, respectively. The seasonal changes of water ecological health classification rise from level III to level II, and the health status rises from the general level to the sub -health level. The overall trend is rising, the average value is 0.4935, the health classification is level III, and the health status is general. Generally speaking, the water ecological health level of the Muling River Basin is the highest in autumn.

Remote sensing has been increasingly used to complement in situ monitoring or to provide water colour data for unmonitored inland water bodies. However, due to spatial, radiometric, and spectral constraints, it has been heavily focused on large lakes. Sentinel-2 MSI is the first sensor with the capability to consistently retrieve a wide range of essential water quality variables, such as chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) and water transparency, in small water bodies, and to provide long time series. Here, we provide and validate a framework for retrieving two variables, chl-a and turbidity, over lakes with diverse optical characteristics using Sentinel-2 imagery. It is based on GRS for atmospheric and sun glint correction, WaterDetect for water detection, and inversion models that were automatically selected based on two different sets of optical water types (OWTs)-one for each variable; for chl-a, we produced a blended product for improved spatial representation. To validate the approach, we compared the products with more than 600 in situ data from 108 lakes located in the Adour-Garonne river basins, ranging from 3 to similar to 5000 ha, as well as remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data collected during 10 field campaigns during the summer and spring seasons. Rrs retrieval (n = 65) was robust for bands 2 to 5, with MAPE varying from 15 to 32% and achieving correlation from 0.74 up to 0.92. For bands 6 to 8A, the Rrs retrieval was much less accurate, being influenced by adjacency effects. Glint removal significantly enhanced Rrs accuracy, with RMSE improving from 0.0067 to 0.0021 sr(-1) for band 4, for example. Water quality retrieval showed consistent results, with an MAPE of 56%, an RMSE of 11.4 mg m(-3), and an r of 0.76 for chl-a, and an MAPE of 47%, an RMSE of 9.7 NTU, and an r of 0.87 for turbidity, and no significant effect of lake area or lake depth on retrieval errors. The temporal and spatial representations of the selected parameters were also shown to be consistent, demonstrating that the framework is robust and can be applied over lakes as small as 3 ha. The validated methods can be applied to retrieve time series of chl-a and turbidity starting from 2016 and with a frequency of up to 5 days, largely expanding the database collected by water agencies. This dataset will be extremely useful for studying the dynamics of these small freshwater ecosystems.

J	Luo, K; Wu, ZL; Bai, HT; Wang, ZJ				Luo, Kang; Wu, Zhaolu; Bai, Haotian; Wang, Zijiang			Bird diversity and waterbird habitat preferences in relation to wetland restoration at Dianchi Lake, south-west China	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: Restoration projects have been implemented worldwide to mitigate the adverse effects of the loss and degradation of wetland habitats. Much research has been carried out on the impacts on birds of wetland restoration and management projects in China. Studies have mainly investigated central or coastal wetlands, while inland wetlands in remote areas have been much less studied. We focused on examining the response of wild birds to wetland restoration in Dianchi Lake, south-west China. Methods: The line transect method was performed at 26 sampling plots. Three of these were in the city, and to acquire all wild bird data 23 plots were located every 2-8 km along the shore of Dianchi Lake, between December 2011 and November 2013. We collected all related bird records by searching the available literature, articles, newspapers and records of birdwatchers to compare species variation before and after implementation of wetland restoration. To measure the relationships between waterbird assemblages and habitat structures, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to pair the main matrix of bird assemblages with a second matrix of habitat variables. Results: We recorded 182 bird species belonging to 51 families and 17 orders. Of the species, 42 were new records for Kunming City and 20 were new records for Yunnan Province. Ten waterbird species were found to have disappeared from the shore of Dianchi Lake. CCA results indicated that waterbirds could be divided into four categories based on their habitat preference: synanthropic (wintering gulls), special habitat (shorebirds), semi-natural (wintering coots and ducks) and disturbance-tolerant (resident) species. Conclusions: Our study is the first to consider the entire wild bird community throughout the year and discuss the species variation before and after wetland restoration projects launched for Dianchi Lake. Distinct habitat requirements of different waterbird groups were detected in our study, suggesting different types of restoration and management should be implemented.					; Wang, Zhaohui/G-2077-2010; Luo, Kang/KEJ-4771-2024	Luo, Kang/0000-0002-8043-1171; 													2053-7166					JUN 6	2019	10								21	10.1186/s40657-019-0162-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-019-0162-9													WOS:000472090200001
J	Sullivan, M; Warwick, JJ; Tyler, SW				Sullivan, M; Warwick, JJ; Tyler, SW			Quantifying and delineating spatial variations of surface infiltration in a small watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The focus of this project is to determine which data collection techniques are best suited for quantifying and delineating spatial variations in surface infiltration and for estimating infiltration parameters used in computer models for simulation of runoff quantity following summer rainstorm events from a small watershed (Incline Creek watershed, Nevada) in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Field tests which give the infiltration parameters of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity, two parameters found in the Philip infiltration model, were performed in the watershed using a disk permeameter. These field data were combined with coverages in an existing Geographical Information System (GIS) database and held observations of surface attributes (soil type and vegetation) which are known to contribute to variation in infiltration rates. Statistical tests performed on the field-test data indicate that the only surface attribute which influences variations in infiltration rates in this watershed (owing mainly to limited variations in soil type) is vegetation. Further, time-to-pending calculations which indicate when and if runoff might occur following the start of a precipitation event indicate that for most precipitation events likely to occur in this area during the summer, infiltration in all but nonforested areas is unlikely. The coverages in the GIS database were used to develop a map of the watershed which delineates areas of low potential infiltration from areas of high potential infiltration which can be used in parameter estimation and watershed conceptualization in computer modeling of runoff.																			0022-1694					JUN	1996	181	1-4					149	168		10.1016/0022-1694(95)02908-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(95)02908-7													WOS:A1996UU52400008

Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia, known for its rich freshwater environment, is an ideal location for studying these insects in the long term. Our study aimed to uncover the types of chironomids present, understand their seasonal patterns, and identify factors influencing their emergence in Plitvice Lakes. For 14 years, we set up traps at a tufa barrier within the National Park to collect chironomids on a monthly basis. During this time, we discovered more than 80 chironomid species. Interestingly, we found that water temperature and organic matter were the key factors affecting chironomid emergence in this area. Toward the end of our study, we noticed that the time these insects spent in flight seemed to increase. Although we have not yet found statistical significance, this could be related to the higher water temperatures in winter. In summary, our research sheds light on the fascinating world of chironomids in Plitvice Lakes, highlighting their diversity, seasonal patterns and the environmental factors influencing their behavior.Abstract Chironomids are found in all types of freshwater habitats; they are a ubiquitous and highly diverse group of aquatic insects. Plitvice Lakes National Park is the oldest and largest national park in Croatia and consists of numerous and diverse freshwater habitats, making the area an ideal location for long-term research into the chironomid emergence patterns and phenology. The main objectives of this study were to identify the composition of the chironomid community, determine the phenology of the identified species, and assess the main factors influencing their emergence in Plitvice Lakes. During 14 years of research, more than 13,000 chironomids belonging to more than 80 species were recorded. The most abundant species was found to be Parametriocnemus stylatus. The highest abundance of chironomids was recorded in lotic habitats with faster water current over substrates of moss and algae and pebbles. Water temperature and the availability of organic matter were found to be the main factors that drive chironomid emergence at the tufa barrier studied. In the last years of this study, a prolonged flight period was observed. Although this is not statistically significant (at this stage of the study), it could be due to a higher water temperature in winter.

However, the response of aquatic AOA to long-term climate change remains unclear. Here, we obtained a continuous sediment record from a deep, oligotrophic lake (Lake Fuxian, China) and reconstructed changes in AOA productivity over the past 26 thousand years (cal ka BP) using a multi-proxy approach. AOA productivity (estimated using diagnostic archaeal lipids) was low during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) before peaking during the cold-dry Heinrich event 1 (H1, 17.7-15.9 cal ka BP). As the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensified and the climate became warmer and wetter, aquatic AOA productivity progressively declined. We show that a combination of factors modulates millennial-scale AOA productivity. In particular, low lake levels under cold-dry climate conditions strengthen lake mixing and nutrient upwelling, promoting AOA productivity; in contrast, high lake levels during warm-humid climate conditions weaken upwelling, resulting in reduced AOA blooms. Changes in terrestrial nutrient availability also exert a secondary control on aquatic primary production and by extension, AOA productivity.

The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has greatly extended its range since the 1990s, with commercial shipping being the main vector. However, our knowledge regarding their secondary dispersal from points of introduction is surprisingly limited. In this study, a series of field experiments were undertaken on a mid-sized river to assess goby dispersal patterns within an established population, following a simulated release of a large number of propagules, or at a simulated invasion front. Most of the established population remained stationary and just a few individuals undertook long-distance dispersal (principally upstream). Mean distance travelled was 1.1 m.day(-1) (max. 29.6 m.day(-1)). While site fidelity appeared to last for most of the year (including winter), it was surprisingly relaxed during the spawning season. Concentrated release of a large number of propagules resulted in appreciably greater movement rates than in the established population, with upstream movement again dominating. In general, smaller, mostly male fish tended to move further and appeared as first colonizers in uninvaded areas.

Mean latewood densities (LWD) were measured by X-ray densitometry; individual series were first cross-dated and then combined to form a standard chronology. We developed a warm-season (JuneAugust) temperature reconstruction of Zajsan Lake area in East Kazakhstan that spans 16002002 based on the standard chronology (LWD). The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 39.1% of the temperature variance from 1901 to 2002 and shows cold phase during the late 1600s early 1700s followed by a warmer period, with cooling again in the late 1700s early 1800s. Several severely cold warm seasons coincide with major volcanic eruptions. Some of the temperature variations also correspond to variations in solar activity. The similarities in trends of the Zajsan chronology (LWD) and the Qinghe chronology (LWD) in Altai Mountain show that there are common large-scale climatic forcings in Central Asian. The low-frequency change of temperature reconstruction is correlated positively with Northern Hemisphere temperatures.

Animal behaviour under the ice is poorly understood, but given that spatial and temporal gradients for temperature and oxygen develop throughout the winter, behavioural thermoregulation may allow the selection of aerobic microenvironments that are conducive to overwintering survival. Accordingly, we have examined the thermoregulatory behaviour and metabolism of cold-submerged frogs in an experimental 'gradient chamber' designed to mimic overwintering conditions in nature. The preferred temperature of 7 degrees C in normoxia decreases to 1.5 degrees C in severe hypoxia, and coincides: with an aerobic metabolic saving of 70-85% and a delay in the onset of a runaway lactacidosis. Following intense exercise, temperature preferences are also lowered from 6.7 degrees C to 3.6 degrees C for upwards of 7 hours in a fashion reminiscent of the 'behavioural hypothermia' response to hypoxia. Cold-submerged frogs are also able to detect isothermal variations in dissolved oxygen and spend 70% of their time at oxygen partial pressures that promote aerobic metabolism. The ability to exploit gradients of oxygen and temperature has strong ecological relevance to over-wintering since the behavioural selection of preferred microhabitats is consistent with minimising the metabolic stresses associated with either hypoxia or hypothermia and promoting survival.

Based on AMS C-14 dating, high resolution records of the humification degree and n-alkane distributions reveal that the region experienced a relatively warm and dry early Holocene (10.0-8.0 ka) and a cold and wet early mid-Holocene (8.0-6.3 ka), followed by a warm and dry mid-Holocene (63-5.5 ka). A shift to cold and wet conditions occurred between 5.5 and 4.0 ka, and then the climate entered into a warmer period from 4.0 to 2.5 ka. In the late Holocene (2.5-1.0 ka), the region experienced a colder and wetter climate. A gradual shift to warm and dry conditions occurred during the last 1.0 Icy in this region. The regional climate patterns have been generally dominated by alternations of warm-dry and cold wet episodes during the Holocene that were quite different from the warm-wet and cool-dry episodes in the Asian summer monsoon region. Regional comparisons indicate that the climate changes in arid central Asia have been mainly influenced by the North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) via the westerlies. However, owing to the mountainous character of the study areas, glacial meltwater, and other local factors, the climate changes in the Altai Mountains region have not always been concordant with variations of North Atlantic Ocean SSTs. We postulate that the history of moisture balance between regional precipitation, glacier and snow meltwater, and evaporation has been modulated by air temperatures that were mainly influenced by changes in the summer insolation of the Northern Hemisphere.

Hypoxic conditions developed in the epilimnion as water temperatures increased following the spring thaw in 1985. Deoxygenation was attributed to respiration by bacteria which formed a gelatinous slime layer on the underside of submerged logs. The observed decrease in juvenile sockeye salmon numbers in affected areas of the log dump site appeared to be a response to epilimnetic hypoxia.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR	1990	24	3					337	343		10.1016/0043-1354(90)90010-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(90)90010-4													WOS:A1990CY81300010

In these closed-basin systems, aqueous geochemistry and mineralogy are intimately linked, whereby the removal of elements through mineral precipitation controls the lake water geochemistry. The resulting extreme water chemistry of alkaline lakes produces minerals that are rare in other environments, including low-temperature minerals that record valuable environmental information and that are commonly extracted as mineral resources.

Fish communities of the Pantanal wetland in Brazil: evaluating the effects of the upper Paraguay river flood pulse on baia Cai‡ara fish fauna	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The physicochemical variables and the ichthyofauna associated with aquatic macrophyte beds in two stretches of the baia Cai double dagger ara were evaluated seasonally between September 2005 and May 2007. Low depth, high water transparency, and relatively well-oxygenated waters characterized both stretches during the low water season, whereas the flooding of the upper Paraguay River correlated with drastic alterations in these variables: depth registered a fivefold increase, and turbid and anoxic waters predominated during the high water season. During the falling and low water seasons, species richness, fish abundance, biomass, and diversity were significantly higher than during periods of rising and high waters. The presence of large-sized migratory species, however, was strictly associated with the high water season. The results suggest strong relationships between the abiotic and biotic components of the system and indicate an overall high degree of dependence of the system on the hydrological seasonality of the upper Paraguay River.

Although consisting mainly of poorly bioavailable lignin, with low protein and lipid content, the carbohydrates from fallen tree leaves and shoreline vegetation may be utilized by aquatic consumers. Here we show that during phytoplankton deficiency, zooplankton (Daphnia magna) can benefit from terrestrial particulate organic matter by using terrestrial-origin carbohydrates for energy and sparing essential fatty acids and amino acids for somatic growth and reproduction. Assimilated terrestrial-origin fatty acids from shoreline reed particles exceeded available diet, indicating that Daphnia may convert a part of their dietary carbohydrates to saturated fatty acids. This conversion was not observed with birch leaf diets, which had lower carbohydrate content. Subsequent analysis of 21 boreal and subarctic lakes showed that diet of herbivorous zooplankton is mainly based on high-quality phytoplankton rich in essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. The proportion of low-quality diets (bacteria and terrestrial particulate organic matter) was < 28% of the assimilated carbon. Taken collectively, the incorporation of terrestrial carbon into zooplankton was not directly related to the concentration of terrestrial organic matter in experiments or lakes, but rather to the low availability of phytoplankton.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020; Aalto, Sanni/AAY-5338-2021	Aalto, Sanni L/0000-0002-6724-2632; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; 													2045-2322					AUG 11	2016	6								30897	10.1038/srep30897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30897								27510848					WOS:000381199500001

Springer Earth System Sciences											Data from terrestrial pollen records in the Chilean sector show that Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) was characterized by the Heinrich (stadials)/Dansgaard-Oeschger (interstadials) oscillations. At central Chile (32-38 degrees S) an open beech/podocarp woodland was apparently established during the last ice age under cold and humid climates, where nowadays grows a semiarid, broad sclerophyllous vegetation, while episodes of aridity with rise of temperature were indicated by expansion of chenopods-amaranths. At the Southern Lake District and northern Isla Grande de ChiloE (40 degrees-42 degrees 30' S), the stadial events were characterized by higher amounts of grasses indicative of the Subantarctic Parkland vegetation. This vegetation implied summer temperatures of similar to 6 degrees C (similar to 8 degrees C below present). The interstadials were represented by expansion of the Valdivian-North Patagonian Evergreen Forest-Subantarctic Evergreen Forest implying summer temperatures of similar to 12 degrees C. In the Argentine sector, the steppe environmental conditions prevailed. Interstadial conditions are pointed out at 39 degrees S, in NW Patagonia. Meanwhile, in southern Patagonia at 51 degrees-52 degrees S, and Tierra del Fuego at 54 degrees S, the climatic conditions during MIS 3 are interpreted as colder and drier than today.

Since 9000 cal BP a mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest dominated by Cyclobalanopsis and Quercus developed in this area, indicating a warm climate condition with enhanced insolation. A mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest was fully developed between 6600-4500 cal BP, which corresponds to the Holocene Climate Optimum with the strong influence of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). After 3000 cal BP the broad-leaved forest decreased rapidly, while land herbs and ferns increased. It seems that the climate condition in East China was similar to the present after Holocene Climate Optimum. Pollen results show a potential interface between environment changes and human activities. Pollen diagram demonstrates that human impacts on the natural vegetation remained weak at the early stage but significantly enhanced upwards. The distinctive fluctuations of the pollen contents among AP (trees and shrubs), and the possible agriculture indicators might infer the potential human behaviors for environment changes. Due to the enlargement of organized farming and increase in population, natural forest was eventually replaced by farmland since 3000 cal BP. This study would increase our knowledge of Holocene vegetation transition related to the monsoon dynamics on a long timescale in East China and provide an environmental background for more detailed studies on cultural developments in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region.

J	Barbieri, R; Cavalazzi, B				Barbieri, Roberto; Cavalazzi, Barbara			Microterracettes in Sabkha Oum Dba (Western Sahara, Morocco): Physical and Biological Interactions in the Formation of a Surface Micromorphology	ASTROBIOLOGY												Small-scale terracing (microterracettes) is a surface geomorphic feature that recurs under a range of environmental settings, such as those existing in high to low temperature geothermal springs and evaporitic environments, through the single or combined action of physicochemical agents and microbiological processes. Such morphology can also be observed in a confined sector of the Sabkha Oum Dba, which is an inland sabkha of the Western Sahara (Morocco), where field and laboratory investigations revealed that they primarily depend on the accumulation of naviculoid diatoms. Through their biofilm production ability, these benthic diatoms are able to stabilize surface morphologies and make organic alveolar frameworks where the precipitation of low Mg calcite occurs in areas subjected to active oxygenic photosynthesis. Because microterracettes arise in a specific set of environmental conditions, they have environmental significance and, thanks to a high fossilization potential due to mineral precipitation, they can be an effective source of biomorphological and chemical evidence for life. The relationship with aqueous environments, considered to be widespread on Mars especially during a period of intense hydrologic activity as in the late Noachian and Hesperian periods, make the understanding of surficial processes useful (such as the formation of microterracettes) whose formation is frequent in terrestrial analogues for martian environments, such as ephemeral saline continental lakes (sabkhas) and related to the products of bacterial and eukaryotic life, as in the case of biofilms, in search for similar life forms beyond Earth.

The geothermal water emerged from a porous lava flow and rapidly cooled in contact with seawater except at low tide. The bacterial species represented by strains FRR-10(T) and FRR-11 was nonpigmented, strictly aerobic, and organotrophic. Several genes, bchZ, pufB, pufA, pufL, or pufM, encoding the photosynthetic reaction center proteins and the core light-harvesting complexes were not detected in these strains. The organism oxidized thiosulfate to sulfate with enhancement of growth. The organism did not require additional NaCl in the culture medium for growth, but NaCl at 1.0% enhanced growth. Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain FRR-10T indicated that the new organism represented a new species of the alpha-3 subclass of the Proteobacteria and that it branches within the species of the genus Rhodovulum. The contradiction of classifying an organism which branches within the radiation of the genus Rhodovulum but does not possess the hallmark characteristics of this genus is discussed. However, the absence of several of these characteristics, namely, the lack of photosynthesis and pigmentation, which could be related to colonization of dark environments, and growth at high temperatures, leads to our proposal that strains FRR-10T and FRR-11 should be classified as a new species of a novel genus, Albidovulum inexpectatum, representing, at present, the most thermophilic organism within the a-3 subclass of the Proteobacteria.					; Rainey, Fred/AAG-7996-2019; Empadinhas, Nuno/G-3118-2011	da Costa, Milton/0000-0003-4027-4412; Albuquerque, Luciana/0000-0002-6957-4673; Empadinhas, Nuno/0000-0001-8938-7560													0099-2240					SEP	2002	68	9					4266	4273		10.1128/AEM.68.9.4266-4273.2002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.68.9.4266-4273.2002								12200275					WOS:000177718000014

In the littoral zone, the zooplankton is affected by a number of unaccounted factors, and the influence of planktophagous fish, mainly inhabiting deepwater areas, is less pronounced. A significant increase in biomass of planktophagous fish in 2016-2017 leads to a reduction in the quantitative characteristics of zooplankton, resulting in decreased water clarity.

Effects of temperature and food supply on the growth of whitefish Coregonus lavaretus larvae in an oligotrophic peri-alpine lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The relative roles of temperature and food availability on the seasonal and daily growth of whitefish Coregonus lavaretus larvae were investigated in the oligotrophic peri-alpine Lake Annecy, France. During the spring from 2004 to 2007, surface water temperature and density of potential zooplankton prey were monitored, and 2688 larvae were caught and measured. In addition, the daily growth of 130 larvae was estimated retrospectively by investigating the microstructure of their otoliths. Temperature played the predominant role in controlling both seasonal and daily growth of early larvae. In contrast, the abundance of Mesocyclops leuckarti and larval density was only slightly correlated to larval growth, suggesting no food limitation nor strong interindividual competition over the study period. Overall, these findings run counter to concerns about potential food limitation, but sound a warning about the potential impact of climate change on fish ecology and fisheries management.					; perrier, charles/ABE-7961-2020	PERRIER, Charles/0000-0001-5820-9374; 													0022-1112					OCT	2012	81	5					1501	1513		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03393.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03393.x								23020558					WOS:000309452800004

Here, we conducted U-Th dating of tufa deposits exposed along the shoreline of Longmu Co Lake in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau to reconstruct its water level history during the middle-late Holocene. Our data demonstrate that Longmu Co Lake reached its highest level (61 m above the present level) at around 7.4 ka in response to the strengthened Indian Summer Monsoon and increased glacial meltwater; its lake level subsequently decreased due to solar insolation-induced decline in summer monsoon and glacial meltwater. Moreover, we find that the lake level experienced an abrupt decline at similar to 2.2 ka with a maximum amplitude of 13 m, probably owing to the rapid cooling of the local climate. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 of Longmu Co tufa also show a covariance trend, which supports the regional climate change reflected by the lake level fluctuation of Longmu Co. Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation between initial delta U-234 content in tufa and lake level variation, suggesting that initial calcium delta U-234 can serve as a proxy for reconstructing environmental changes. Our study therefore implies that lake tufa as a reliable archive for accurately reconstructing lake level changes.

Chronostratigraphic palaeo-climate phasing based on southern African wetlands: From the escarpment to the eastern seaboard	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												This paper aims to identify chronostratigraphic palaeo-climatic boundaries based on proxy indications from mountain -and coastal wetlands in eastern South Africa and Lesotho. Phase boundaries were identified from timing of climate change inferred by proxies, as well as regime shifts in climate variability. Sometimes magnitude and/or frequency of change was also considered. Summarizing the common palaeo-climatic indications suggest the following chronostratigraphic climate phases: 25 to 18 ka, 18 to 15 ka, 15 to 11.5, 11.5 to 8 ka, 8 to 5.5 ka, 5.5 to 2 ka and 2 to 0 ka. The most robust boundaries were identified at 18 ka, 15 ka and 2 ka, i.e. these boundaries were supported by several proxies/sites. The other boundaries were less clearly detected from available proxies/sites and should be regarded tentative. The timing of a climate shift often coincides at coast and mountain sites. However, the climate conditions within each chronostratigraphic phase sometimes vary between coast and inland sites. The 25 to 18 ka phase was cool and dry with strong and frequent storms, followed by the ca. 18 to 15 ka period when conditions were less severe but still generally cool and dry. At ca. 15 to 11.5 ka several proxies infer warmer climate, with less winter rains. During 11.5 to 8 ka a general increase in wetness is inferred, followed by warming over the 8 to 5.5 ka phase. Between 5.5 and 2 ka a successive change towards wetter is indicated, although timing differ between sites. After 2 ka generally a more variable climate is seen, often with high magnitude shifts between dry and wet. The data resolution, i.e. the number of available wetland records, increases with time from very low during glacial times, to highest resolution during late Holocene. Geographically, sites in the mountain region are overrepresented compared to coastal sites. A comparison with coastal lake records suggests a more variable climate at coastal sites compared to mountain sites during mid-and late Holocene, although different proxy resolution and methodology cannot be ruled out as an explanation. A case study compares multiproxy records from Drakensberg (Sekhokong, Ntsikeni) and the coast (Mfabeni), discussing advantages and problems associated with proxy-comparisons within and between sites.

J	Chen, X; Wang, YQ; Zhu, ZW; Tang, JY; Zhou, MJ				Chen, Xiao; Wang, Yuqian; Zhu, Zhiwei; Tang, Jingyue; Zhou, Maojun			A comprehensive study on the impacts of isolation heat exchangers on the energy performance of surface water heat pump systems	GEOTHERMICS												Surface water heat pumps are included as a subset of ground-source heat pumps for the utilization of shallow geothermal energy. For the surface water heat pump applications in which the location of the heat pump plant is remarkably higher than water surface, the pump energy consumption of an indirect system with isolation heat exchangers (IHE) will be lower than that of a direct system without IHE. However, the entering fluid temperature of heat pumps in an indirect system is higher/lower than that in a direct system in cooling/heating modes due to the existence of IHE, which will bring a certain decrease in heat pump performance. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the impacts of IHE on system energy performance. The energy performance models for indirect and direct systems are developed, and a method for energy-saving judgment between indirect and direct systems is proposed. The case study results show that a direct system is more energy efficient for cooling than an indirect system because the elevation difference between water surface and plant is less than the critical value. Under low surface water temperature condition in winter, an indirect system using antifreeze fluid can eliminate the defect that the heating capacity of heat pumps in a direct system decreases much and auxiliary heat is needed. An optimized system configuration that combines the advantages of direct and indirect systems is proposed. The proposed system can operate without auxiliary heat in winter even though the surface water temperature drops to a low level, and can acquire cooling performance close to that of the cooling systems including chillers and cooling towers.
