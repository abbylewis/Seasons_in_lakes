J	Pandey, P; Ali, SN; Simon, A				Pandey, Pratima; Ali, Sheikh Nawaz; Simon, Allen			Rock glacier Oasis: An alternative for agro-pastoralism in a changing environment in the Himalayan cold desert COMMENT	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												The unprecedented climate change has catastrophic repercussions for high mountain communities and these issues need a multi-disciplinary understanding for adaptation and mitigation strategies. The limited cultivable agricultural land and pastures along with an abridged cultivation season and water scarcity, all have severely impacted local communities in the cold desert of Ladakh. The indigenous people relying on glacier and snow-melt have developed unique water management and agro-pastoralism practices and are searching for additional alternatives owing to continuous climate and lifestyle changes. People are increasingly relocating to higher valleys in search of adequate cultivable land. In this endeavour, people are found to be practicing agro-pastoral activities adjacent to the thermokarst lakes (Oasis) present on the rock glaciers. The present study is a one-of-a-kind overview of such innovative and adaptive farming strategies to encourage research towards the water storage in such features, and how long it will remain sustainable.					ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025														0016-7398	1475-4959				DEC	2022	188	4					585	590		10.1111/geoj.12468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12468		AUG 2022											WOS:000839528400001

In this study. we examined the dynamics of anopheline adult mosquitoes their larval habitats, and egg survival potential during the dry season in the basin region of Lake Victoria western Kenya. Through field surveys, we demonstrated two survival strategies of An. gambiae sensu stricto during the dry season: continuous reproduction throughout the year and embryo dormancy in moist soil for at least several days. We further demonstrated that An. gambiae shows a strong preference for moist soil as an oviposition substrate rather than dry soil substrate under the insectary conditions. The observation that anopheline eggs remain a dormant stage to resist desiccation clearly contrasts the conventional wisdom that anopheline eggs hatch shortly after they are laid. Our results from western Kenya are consistent with the suggestion that anopheline mosquitoes do not necessarily suffer a severe population bottleneck during the dry season and thus maintain a large effective population size.						, Noboru/0000-0003-3664-9605													0022-2585					MAY	2001	38	3					388	392		10.1603/0022-2585-38.3.388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585-38.3.388								11372963					WOS:000168588900007

In this study, 10 IPB strains were isolated from the sediments of a lagoon suffering from macroalgal blooms dominated by Chaetomorpha linum - Rongcheng Swan Lagoon, China - and their taxonomy was determined by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The phosphate-solubilizing characteristics of the obtained IPB strains were evaluated using a liquid medium, and the ability of IPB strains to dissolve P from sediments and the transformation of inorganic phosphorus (IP) fractions were investigated by inoculating IPB strains into a sediment-water experimental system. The 10 isolated IPB strains belonged to one family, two genera, and four species. All IPB strains in the liquid medium culture dissolved tricalcium phosphate, but the phosphate-solubilizing ability of IPB varied greatly between strains and appeared to be promoted when the strains were grown in mixed-strain cultures. Bacillus megaterium showed the strongest phosphate-solubilizing ability. The IPB inoculation experiment showed a large decrease in the Ca-bound P (HCl-P) concentration of sediments in various IPB inoculation treatments, especially in sediments from the central lake. Our results indicate that, under the action of IPB, there is great potential for the release of HCl-P, which is the primary IP fraction of lagoon sediments, and more attention should be given to the endogenous P pollution in Swan Lagoon Wetland.

The current status of glacial lakes in this region has not been reported in recent years. Therefore, this study investigates the variations of glacial lakes in the Kyrgyz and Teskey ranges using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope optical satellite images from 2017 to 2019. Results confirm that there are 800 glacial lakes, of which 351 were in the Kyrgyz and 449 were in the Teskey Range. We found seasonality in the character of glacial lakes, most of which have been found to be unstable during our observation period. 242 glacial lakes showed significant variations in area. We found 46 newly emerging glacial lakes, five of which have rapidly expanded in the year since they formed, while 18 were found to have vanished. Thirteen lakes were found to be short-lived or unstable. In this study, 14 lakes showed a significant expansion of area. Such large variations in the glacial lakes are closely linked to local geomorphological conditions, local climate and glacier melt. We also identified a significant shift in the number of glacial lakes at altitudes over 3,500 m asl. It is associated with the mountain permafrost zone and variations of the glacier terminus. The current study recommends detailed investigation of glacial lakes in each season with the use of remote sensing and field surveys.

The Laguna Timone is situated within a maar of the Pali Aike Volcanic Field, a Quaternary volcano-tectonic complex in southernmost South America and represents one of hundreds of "pools " of brines developed after explosive volcanic eruptions in a periglacial environment. The lake consti-tutes an endorheic hydrological system where processes leading to carbonate precipitation took place under ex-treme physicochemical conditions and biological influences that can be explored. Laguna Timone is recharged by groundwater and sporadic episodes of precipitation (ca. 200 mm/year) and high evaporation rates are controlled by regimes of strong wind (westerlies) and seasonal solar radiation. Carbonate precipitation was studied in microbialite fragments of tufa deposits and carbonate crust located in the edge of the lake, and the mineralogy of all samples is calcite. The clay fraction of the sediment underlying the carbonates was characterized and HRTEM analysis shows that authigenic smectites have influence on calcite crystal precipitation. The positive delta O-18 values (2.28 parts per thousand) in thin crust layers are associated with evaporation processes. In contrast, the negative delta O-18 values (-6.52 parts per thousand) in the microbialites show meteoric and/or groundwater influences. The delta C-13 (-0.43 parts per thousand to 2.50 parts per thousand) values indicate physico-chemical and biochemical processes controlling the precipitation. The carbon-ate precipitation involves the interrelations of hydrogeological properties, climate and biological influences. Laguna Timone provides a natural laboratory for understanding mineral precipitation processes that register continuous climatic and environmental archives. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we examine expression of Kir2 channels in the heart of three Gadiformes species, polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and navaga (Eleginus nawaga) of the Arctic Ocean and burbot (Lota lota) of the temperate lakes to find out the role of Kir2 channels in cardiac adaptation to cold. Five boreal freshwater species: brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius), and zebrafish (Danio rerio), were included for comparison. Transcript expression of genes encoding Kir2.1a, - 2.1b, - 2.2a, - 2.2b and - 2.4 was studied from atrium and ventricle of thermally acclimated or acclimatized fish by quantitative PCR. Kir2 composition in the polar cod was more diverse than in other species in that all Kir2 isoforms were relatively highly expressed. Kir2 composition of navaga and burbot differed from that of the polar cod as well as from those of other species. The relative expression of Kir2.2 transcripts, especially Kir2.2b, was higher in both atrium and ventricle of navaga and burbot (56-89% from the total Kir2 pool) than in other species (0.1-11%). Thermal acclimation induced only small changes in cardiac Kir2 transcript expression in Gadiformes species. However, Kir2.2b transcripts were upregulated in cold-acclimated navaga and burbot hearts. All in all, the cardiac Kir2 composition seems to be dependent on both phylogenetic position and thermal preference of the fish.

Roost site selection by ring-billed and herring gulls	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Gulls (Larus spp.) commonly roost in large numbers on inland and coastal waters, yet there is little information on how or where gulls choose sites for roosting. Roost site selection can lead to water quality degradation or aviation hazards when roosts are formed on water supply reservoirs or are close to airports. Harassment programs are frequently initiated to move or relocate roosting gulls but often have mixed results because gulls are reluctant to leave or keep returning. As such, knowledge of gull roost site selection and roosting ecology has applied and ecological importance. We used satellite telemetry and an information-theoretic approach to model seasonal roost selection of ring-billed (L. delawarensis) and herring gulls (L. argentatus) in Massachusetts, USA. Our results indicated that ring-billed gulls preferred freshwater roosts and will use a variety of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Herring gulls regularly roosted on fresh water but used salt water roosts more often than ring-billed gulls and also roosted on a variety of land habitats. Roost modeling showed that herring and ring-billed gulls selected inland fresh water roosts based on size of the water body and proximity to their last daytime location; they selected the largest roost closest to where they ended the day. Management strategies to reduce or eliminate roosting gulls could identify and try to eliminate other habitat variables (e.g., close-by foraging sites) that are attracting gulls before attempting to relocate or redistribute (e.g., through hazing programs) roosting birds.

Genesis and provenance of a new Middle Pleistocene diamicton unit at Happisburgh, NE Norfolk, UK	PROCEEDINGS OF THE YORKSHIRE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Glacigenic deposits at Happisburgh, NE Norfolk, record the earliest known expansion of glaciers into lowland eastern England during the Quaternary. The sequence comprises two regionally extensive till units, the Happisburgh Till and Corton Diamicton members of the Happisburgh Glacigenic Formation, deposited during separate ice advances, and intervening glacilacustrine and outwash deposits laid down during ice-marginal retreat. During 2012, a new diamicton unit was discovered within the intervening sorted sediments and its significance is outlined here. Sedimentological and structural evidence suggests, tentatively, that the diamicton forms a small debris fan generated subaerially by a series of water-saturated hyperconcentrated or debris flows. The precise trigger mechanism for these flow deposits remains unclear, but may relate to seasonal melting of surface or buried ice followed by mass-movement, or to more abrupt geological events including periods of intense rainfall, moraine dam failure or a glacier outburst flood.

The invasion window for warmwater fish in clearwater lakes: the role of ultraviolet radiation and temperature	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimIn clear, cold-water lakes, ultraviolet radiation (UV) and temperature are two important stressors that may prevent the establishment of aquatic invasive species by inhibiting the survival of sensitive early life history stages. In this study, we develop a UV-temperature response model to predict the establishment potential of a warmwater fish, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), in a large subalpine lake based on the ability of bass larvae to tolerate UV and temperature stress along a UV-temperature stress gradient. LocationLake Tahoe (California/Nevada, USA). MethodsWe compared the UV tolerance of largemouth bass larvae to that of the native redside minnow (Richardsonius egregius) in outdoor UV exposure-response experiments. A UV-temperature response model for larval bass was developed that combined the experimentally derived UV exposure response from our outdoor experiments with a temperature response curve derived from the literature. We used the UV-temperature response model to predict reproductive success (i.e. larval survival) over the range of UV exposure and temperature conditions in nearshore Lake Tahoe. The model predictions were validated with in situ incubation experiments at nearshore locations. ResultsNon-native bass were significantly less UV tolerant than native redside minnows. The UV-temperature response model predicted that larval bass survival varies seasonally, spatially and over depth gradients in nearshore Lake Tahoe and is constrained by UV and temperature conditions. In situ incubation experiments confirmed model predictions. Main conclusionsOur findings provide important insights into the potential for species invasion in clear, cold-water lakes that are experiencing significant changes in both temperature and transparency. The conceptual model and approach that we employ is a potentially powerful tool for exploring unanswered questions in invasion biology, including the role of alternate stable states in facilitating invasion and the potential for invasive species to promote invasional meltdown' through their impacts on water clarity and temperature.

The components of beta diversity (e.g., species turnover and nestedness) and underlying factors are still poorly understood. Here, we report an investigation of two alternative approaches-beta diversity (beta diversity) partitioning and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD)-including their responses to selected environmental factors and representativeness of samples in estimating the ecological fitness of a lake. The beta diversity of diatoms and their local contributions could be explained by the effects of environmental variables (p < 0.01). The random forest method showed the most contribution to the variance for NO3- , Cl-, and SO42-. PERMANOVA as well as a network analysis in JASP (Jeffrey's Amazing Statistics Program) showed significant differences between the seasons in diatom assemblages and in the diatom index for Polish lakes (IOJ). Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for community organizations along environmental gradients from the perspective of beta diversity components, and mechanisms of the indication value of diatoms for lakes; the results could be used especially by countries implementing ecological assessments.

Tropical environmental change in North Sumatra at the Last Glacial Maximum: Evidence from the stable isotope composition of cave guano	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Insular Southeast Asia is of critical importance to global biodiversity, climate, and socioeconomics. Past environmental histories are a crucial factor influencing contemporary patterns and, in this region, fluctuating sea-level and climate change during the Last Glacial Period (LGP) resulted in drastic changes in both land extent and vegetation cover. However, understanding the past environments of this tropical region is hampered by its sheer size and relative lack of traditional continental proxy records, such as lake sediments. To provide further insight into the response of vegetation to the changing environmental conditions, we use the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of a bat guano sequence from Liang Mbelen Cave in North Sumatra, to determine whether tropical grass (C-4 vegetation) or forest (C-3 vegetation) was present in the area from c. 30 to 10 cal kyr BP. Our results confirm the presence of C-4 vegetation during the LGP; however, we find that the timing of grass expansion was just prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 23-19 kyr BP). Comparing Liang Mbelen with the other evidence from across the region, we find a generally consistent pattern of peak tropical grasses often occurring prior to the LGM in Sundaland, with the timing of forest encroachment variable, although beginning at c. 25 cal kyr BP. We find that the timing of the shift from savanna to forest systems in Sundaland is similar to changes in obliquity, likely resulting in a decrease or elimination of the dry season that favoured forest expansion. Understanding past vegetation history will help the management and protection of the fragile and ecologically valuable ecosystems of SE Asia.

The lakes in Taihu Lake Basin play an important role in maintaining regional ecological stabilities; however, the optical characteristics of the CDOM in the upstream and downstream lakes in this basin have not yet been systematically studied. Here, the optical characteristics of CDOM in ten lakes of upstream and downstream of the Taihu Lake Basin were studied using UV-Visible and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopies. Three different fluorophores consisting of two humic-like components (C1, C2) and one protein-like component (C3) were identified by parallel factor analysis. Soil or surface erosion was responsible for the higher abundance of C1 in the upstream lakes, and increased biological activities accounted for the higher abundance of C3 in the downstream lakes. Rainfall erosion in the wet season led to an increase in CDOM. We also found that the photodegradation and flocculation degree, which played a significant role in reducing CDOM, were higher in downstream lakes than in upstream lakes. Optical analysis of CDOM provides a promising method for monitoring water qualities (e.g., total phosphorus and potassium permanganate index) in each lake. Reductions in soil or surface erosion in the upstream are needed to improve water quality.

Typically, ecosystems with submersed aquatic vegetation are relatively shallow, physically stable and of moderate hydrodynamic energy. Wind-waves are often important to sediment resuspension. These are open systems that receive flows of material and energy to various degrees around their boundaries. Bed shear-stress, erosion, light extinction and submersed aquatic vegetation influence each other. Therefore, it is difficult to uncouple these components in model systems. Spatial changes in temperature, salinity, dissolved and particulate material depend on hydrodynamics. Water motions range from wind-wave scales on the small end, which might be important to erosion, to sub-tidal or seasonal scales on the large end, which are generally important to flushing. Seagrass modifies waves and, therefore, affects the relationships among the non-dimensional scaling parameters commonly used in wave analysis. Seagrass shelters the bed, often causing aggradation and changes in grain size, while increasing total resistance to flow. Hydrodynamic friction can not be well characterized by a single-parameter equation in seagrass beds, and models need appropriate enhancement when applied to these systems. Presently, modeling is limited by computational power, which is, however, improving. Other limitations include information on seagrass effects expressed in frictional resistance to currents, bed-sheltering, and wave damping in very shallow water under conditions of both normal and high bed roughness. Moreover, quantitative information on atmospheric friction and shear stress in shallow water and seagrass areas are needed. So far, various empirical equations have been used with wind or wave forcing to describe resuspension in shallow water. Although these equations have been reasonably successful in predicting suspended sediment concentrations, they require site-specific data. More detailed laboratory and field measurements are needed to improve the resuspension equations and model formulation pertaining to seagrass beds.					stelling, gustaaf/M-7775-2014; Garcia, Marcelo/A-9982-2016														0018-8158					FEB	2001	444	1-3					1	24		10.1023/A:1017524430610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017524430610													WOS:000168334400001

Few of these efforts, however, have focused on the underlying mechanisms of the seasonal alterations of in rotifer clone groups. To gain insights into the seasonal variation patterns of genetic differentiation in rotifer populations, 158 clones of the Brachionus calyciflorus Pallas species complex, with seasonal sampling from Guangzhou and Wuhu in China, were sequenced and analyzed based on the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. DNA taxonomy provided estimates of evolving entities ranging from 3 to 21 by combining the mitochondrial and nuclear markers with the different ABGD, PTP, and GMYC models. The most conservative number of the three evolving entities was used for further phylogenetic and population structure analyses. The B. calyciflorus species complex was found to have extreme nucleotide diversity, revealing twice the diversity from the COI dataset than from ITS. The similar patterns of seasonal succession in B. calyciflorus were investigated in the two habitats of Guangzhou and Wuhu, and the clonal groups involved in seasonal succession were actually sibling or cryptic species within the B. calyciflorus complex. We assume that these cryptic species are specialized for their ecological niches, especially in terms of temperature preference. The spatio-temporal patterns of population genetic structure varied with cryptic species, e.g. cryptic species II (-COI/-ITS) had much greater genetic differentiation among sampling sites than among seasonal populations and cryptic species III (-COI/-ITS) displayed a reverse pattern.

Approaches for Monitoring Pacific Lamprey Spawning Populations in a Coastal Oregon Stream	BIOLOGY, MANAGEMENT, AND CONSERVATION OF LAMPREYS IN NORTH AMERICA	American Fisheries Society Symposium				American-Fisheries-Society Symposium 72 on Biology and Conservation of Lampreys in North America	SEP 06, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Amer Fisheries Soc				We evaluated two methods for assessing Pacific lamprey Lampetra tridentata spawning populations (visual counts of spawning adults and redds) and one method for assessing larval production (emergent ammocoete counts from drift nets) in the South Fork Coquille River, Oregon in 2004 and 2005. All three methods generally provided similar portrayals of timing, duration, and magnitude of spawning, including greater abundance in 2004 and seasonally bimodal spawning in 2005. We found a linear relationship between adult and redd counts but a high redd to adult ratio that varied seasonally in both years. The high redd to adult ratio can be attributed to short residence time in spawning areas and temperature or habitat-dependent differences in detection of adults, both of which can undermine adult count data. Redds had relatively longer persistence and larger numbers compared to adults and therefore may be a more practical survey method, but variable redd shape, size, and age, as well as superimposition, presented significant counting errors. Both adult and redd counts had no clear-cut way to quantify errors. Sampling emergent ammocoetes in the drift allowed detection of low density early and late season spawning and would be the preferred survey method when surveys of spawning adults and redds are impractical due to river size, visibility, or access. Even when spawning surveys are practical, emergent ammocoete counts may be better for detecting and monitoring small populations. Disadvantages of ammocoete sampling include nighttime work hours, extra laboratory time, and difficulties with species identification. The general absence of a stock-recruit relationship in lampreys means adult and redd counts are poor predictors of ammocoete production and emergent ammocoete abundance is a poor predictor of spawning abundance. The relationship breaks down because of variability in early survival, which is best detected using data from both spawning surveys and larval drift samples.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-13-4				2009	72						203	+																WOS:000277990500012
J	Shealer, DA; Buzzell, JM; Heiar, JP				Shealer, DA; Buzzell, JM; Heiar, JP			Effect of floating nest platforms on the breeding performance of Black Terns	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												In 2003 and 2004, we placed 41 floating nest platforms on Grassy Lake in southeastern Wisconsin (USA) to test the hypothesis that reproductive success of Black Terns (Chlidonias niger) is limited by the quality of suitable nesting habitat. Extreme differences in water levels between these 2 yr provided a natural experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the nest platforms during a drought year (2003) when natural nesting substrate was abundant, and a flood year (2004) when natural substrate was limited during the peak nesting period. Terns nested on 27 of 41 (66%) of the platforms in 2003 and 26 of 41 (63%) in 2004. No difference in the occupancy rate of platforms and natural nests was evident in 2003, but the pattern of clutch initiations early in the season in 2004 indicated that platforms were preferred over natural substrates. In 2003, nest survival rates did not differ between nests placed on platforms and those placed on natural substrates, but platform nests had significantly higher hatching success and nest survival rates in 2004. Both the Kaplan-Meier and Apparent Nest Success methods of calculating nest survival provided similar estimates. In both years, eggs laid on platforms were significantly larger than those laid on natural substrates, suggesting that platforms were occupied by high-quality birds. Our study indicates that floating nest platforms can be an effective management tool to enhance nesting habitat for Black Terns and other aquatic birds that construct floating nests, primarily because platforms provide nest sites when natural sites are not available due to flooding. Nest platforms also may be useful for addressing questions concerning habitat selection and parental quality.																			0273-8570					SPR	2006	77	2					184	194		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2006.00040.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1557-9263.2006.00040.x													WOS:000237706500013

Over these 6 years, specific spatial and time differences in water isotope composition of Ladoga and small water bodies and streams were found. These differences depended firstly, on wetland type and the lakes distribution on the water-shed and secondly, on groundwater discharge and type of lithological substrate (geological sediments or crystalline rocks). Besides landscape, climate (air temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration) is a main physical factor which controls all scales of the stable isotope variations. In modern times, the sub-latitudinal gradient of climate but also presence of permafrost in the past effects the stable isotope variation. The isotopic composition divides the tributaries of Ladoga into three groups with a wide range of delta O-18 seasonal variations, and a significant atmospheric component. The isotopic composition of Ladoga water is generally stable ranging from delta O-18 =-11.7 to-9.5 parts per thousand (average delta O-18 =-10.6 parts per thousand;), 82H =-84 to-74 parts per thousand; (average 82H =-78 parts per thousand). The effect of evaporation is clearly seen due to accumulation of deuterium and oxygen-18 and a shift to the right from the Local Meteoric Water Line of 82H versus 818O diagram. In Lake Ladoga there is a local deviation of delta O-18 which can be explained by subaqueous discharge of ground-water from Riphean sediments.

Implications for post-comminution processes in subglacial suspended sediment using coupled radiogenic strontium and neodymium isotopes	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Enhanced physical weathering rates in subglacial systems promote high levels of comminution, transport, and deposition of fine-grained sediment within the subglacial drainage network. The impact of shifts in sediment loads from variations in meltwater flux, and their effects on downstream ecosystems, remains poorly quantified and places a fundamental importance on our ability to characterize subglacial depositional environments. Here, for the first time, we assess the seasonal evolution of the subglacial suspended sediment using coupled radiogenic strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86) and neodymium (Nd-143/Nd-144) isotopic ratios with elemental ratios and in situ measurements. Weathering rates in fluvial and riverine systems have been traditionally assessed using radiogenic isotopic tracers: Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios relate to the crustal age whereas Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios relate to age and preferential mineral dissolution. Thus relative shifts in these ratios will allow us to characterize distinct sediment transport networks. We apply this technique to the Lemon Creek Glacier (LCG), Alaska, USA, and to the Athabasca Glacier (AG), Alberta, CA. At the LCG, the Nd-143/Nd-144 values range from epsilon(Nd) of -4.6 (0.9) to -8.7 (0.2), which suggests a poorly mixed sediment flux. However, the greatest period of variability may correlate with the drainage of a supraglacial lake and suggests caution should be exerted in time-scale Nd-143/Nd-144 provenance studies that may be affected by climatic disturbances. In contrast, limited variation is observed within the AG Nd-143/Nd-144 seasonal record. A consistent, direct relation between the Rb/Sr elemental ratio and the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio proves interesting as it enables us to unravel incongruent weathering trends in the radiogenic Sr record. Correlation between the Sr-87/Sr-86 and total discharge suggests that the process is partially controlled by mantling of the bedrock, which can be detected using post-comminution ages. While the subglacial structure may be enabled by the subglacial till beneath the AG, our study supports the use of Sr-Nd as a new proxy in the subglacial environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we determined the vertical distribution of C. pengoi in Lake Ontario with respect to other zooplankton species and possible biotic and abiotic controlling factors and used seasonal time series of potential prey species, both before and after C. pengoi invasion. to make inferences about predatory impacts of C. pengoi. The highest abundances of C. pengoi generally Occurred at the bottom of the epilimnion or at the top of the metalimnion, and strong diet vertical migration was not observed. The vertical distribution of cyclopoid and calanoid nauplii and copepodids was deeper in 1999 than had historically been observed, which Suggest possible avoidance of C. pengoi or localized predatory depletion. Seasonal analyses of normalized biomass size spectra from the Bay Of Quinte supported an impact of C. pengoi on organisms <0.1 mu q, dry weight. The hypothesized predatory effect on juvenile copepods was supported by an analysis of seasonal time series, where we observed that high abundances of C. pengoi coincided with marked decreases in these groups. Consequently, the presence of C. pengoi likely decreases the production Of juvenile copepods both through direct predation and through a shift of copepod vertical distribution to colder waters. Among the cladocerans, only Bosmina longirostris abundance declined in the presence of C. pengoi in the analysis of seasonal time series.

J	Dubus, IG; Hollis, JM; Brown, CD				Dubus, IG; Hollis, JM; Brown, CD			Pesticides in rainfall in Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Papers and published reports investigating the presence of pesticides in rainfall in Europe were reviewed. Approximately half of the compounds that were analysed for were detected. For those detected, most concentrations were below about 100 ng/l, but larger concentrations, up to a few thousand nanograms per litre, were detected occasionally at most monitoring sites. The most frequently detected compounds were lindane (gamma-HCH) and its isomer (alpha-HCH), which were detected on 90-100% of sampling occasions at most of the sites where they were monitored. For compounds developed more recently, detection was usually limited to the spraying season. A classification of pesticides according to their deposition pattern is proposed.

A simple index explains annual atrazine transport from surface runoff-prone watersheds in the north-central USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Year-to-year dynamics in weather affect both the timing of application and the potential hydrologic transport of pesticides. Further, the most commonly used pesticides dissipate in the environment during the growing season. Interactions among these factors - hydrology, timing of application and dissipation kinetics - hinder the detection of temporal trends in transport. It is increasingly important to be able to discern such trends, to judge effectiveness of management practices or to determine whether observed changes were caused by management or weather. In previous work, a cumulative vulnerability index was developed to account for these three factors. It explained 63% of annual variation in atrazine load in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW). The objectives of the current work were (i) to generalize the cumulative vulnerability index to explicitly account for variation in watershed size, area treated with atrazine and average application rate; (ii) to test the overall performance on watersheds showing such variation; and (3) to test whether the generalized index properly accounted for the additional input parameters. The generalized index was tested using data from GCEW (73.7km(2)) and seven additional watersheds in the northeast Missouri claypan region that varied in size from 212 to 1180km(2) and from 4% to 23% of watershed area planted to corn or sorghum. Across 32 site-years, the generalized index explained 84% of variation in annual atrazine load. Further, tests of residuals showed no dependence on either watershed area or fraction of area planted to corn and sorghum, indicating that these parameters were properly integrated into the index. The performance of the index supports the conclusion that data obtained from GCEW is representative of the Mark Twain Lake Basin and likely the entire Central Claypan Major Land Resource Area.

J	Chen, J; Xie, P				Chen, Jun; Xie, Ping			Accumulation of hepatotoxic microcystins in freshwater mussels, aquatic insect larvae and oligochaetes in a large, shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Chaohu) of subtropical China	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												This paper studied the seasonal changes of two common microcystins (MCs), MC-RR and -LR, in the commercially important mussel Corbicula fluminea in Lake Chaohu, where there occurred dense cyanobacteria. Occasional measurements were also made for MC in the mussel Arconaia lanceolat, the oligochaete Limnodilus hoffineisteri and the insect larva Chironomus sp. Mean MC of C. fluminea was much higher in hepatopancreas than in intestine and foot. Our study is the first to report accumulation of MCs in oligochaetes and aquatic insect larvae. The hi-h contents of MCs in the insect larvae suggest a great possibility for the transfer of MCs to benthos-feeding omnivores like common carp. According to the provisional standard by the WHO, 28.6% of the collected C. fluminea were harmful for human consumption, assuming a daily consumption of 300 by a person. It is recommended that edible mussels should not be collected for human consumption during toxic cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Chaohu.

The Lake Van represents an interesting ecosystem in the world, known as the biggest soda lake in the world, in that its water is highly alkaline with a pH of 9.8. C. tarichi has bright-silver color, its back is grayish green, and the abdominal region is silver. Its body is covered with small scales, and its eyes are large. It feeds on phyto and zooplanktons. Its average life span is 7 years, and the fish reaches reproductive maturity at 3 years old. C. tarichi is an diadrom fish that lives in the lake, but during the reproduction period it immigrates to the surrounding freshwater rivers returning after the reproduction period of April-July. In the past, pearl mullet was an attractive fresh fish for the local people and was easily caught during the spawning migration, resulting in over-fishing. The species was one of the highly endangered animals of Turkey before conservation studies, some 10 years ago, have started. At present, illegal fishing activities declined, although some locals are continuing to fish during the spawning season.

Mysis in the Okanagan Lake food web: a time-series analysis of interaction strengths in an invaded plankton community	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Mysis introductions to the lakes of western North America have shown they are important predators on zooplankton, especially daphnids, and intercept energy flows that would otherwise be available to pelagic fishes. However, understanding of the ecological roles of Mysis within invaded communities following their establishment remains weak. We analyzed zooplankton and phytoplankton data collected from Okanagan Lake, British Columbia, within a time-series framework to evaluate the strength of ecological interactions between Mysis and the other dominant plankton. Top-down effects of Mysis in the plankton community were only detected on cyclopoid copepods and cyanophytes. Mysis dynamics were mostly driven by bottom-up effects from diatoms and from small cladocerans whose dynamics were driven primarily by the abundance of edible phytoplankton. This result supports the growing appreciation of the importance of omnivory in mysids and was consistent between the two main basins of the lake. We also analyzed published stable C and N isotope data from the plankton of Okanagan Lake with an isotope mixing model to estimate the relative importance of various potential energy sources to Mysis. This analysis supported the time-series results suggesting the importance of diatoms and small zooplankton to Mysis. However, the isotopes also suggested important resource flows from Daphnia to Mysis, an interaction not detected in the time-series analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that Mysis is a strong interactor in the Okanagan Lake food web, relying in part on energy flow through Daphnia. However, subsidies from diatoms likely decouple seasonal Mysis population dynamics from the seasonal population dynamics of Daphnia.

This species has frequently been characterized either as an omnivore, insectivore or detritivore, the latter, in part, because of its benthic feeding habitats and possession of a gizzard (thick-walled pyloric stomach). We examined diets of two populations of H. niloticus in the So River in southern Benin. A population from the river channel and seasonally flooded marginal plains was dominated by juvenile and subadult size classes. Adults size classes were common in a second population from Lake Hlan, a natural lake in the river floodplain located upstream from the channel study region. Heterotis of all sizes consumed a variety of food resources, ranging from aquatic invertebrates to small seeds. Aquatic invertebrates composed a large proportion of the diets of juveniles, and adults consumed a mixture of aquatic invertebrates, seeds, and detritus. Seasonal dietary variation was observed in both populations, and diet breadth was not significantly different between populations. Aquatic invertebrates remained significant in diets of larger size classes; diets of fish between 100 and 200 mm began to include seeds and detritus, with a marked increase in the volumetric proportion of detritus in diets of fish between 300 and 400 mm in Lake Hlan and between 500 600 mm in the river. Relative gut length was inversely related to body size, which supports the notion that Heterotis is an omnivore and not a specialized detritivore. The thick-walled gizzard of Heterotis, which generally contained sand, probably aids digestion of seed coats. Because Heterotis consume mostly invertebrates and grass seeds in shallow waters of seasonal aquatic habitats and lakes the river floodplain, foraging success and fishery production should be strongly dependent on the annual flood pulse.

Two Microenvironments at the Soil Surface of Saline Wetlands in Monegros, Spain	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Non-trodden soils free of human and livestock pedestrian activity occur on the floors of hypersaline playa-lakes in the Monegros' inland wetlands in Spain. A soil surface vesicular crust (herein designed as A1v horizon) organized in decimetric polygonal plates is the main observable feature of these rare soils inhabited by the perennial halophyte shrub Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moric.) Moris (A.m.). The vesicular organization of the A1v, together with its discontinuity with the soil underneath, suggests the existence of two contrasting soil microenvironments. Thirty-three sites of seven wetlands inhabited by A. m. were sampled: the A horizon from 0 to 15 cm, that is, including A1v; and separately the A1v and the underneath A2 horizon up to 15-cm depth. Measurements included Munsell color, moisture, and salinity at different soil/water ratios, during both the dry and wet seasons along with determinations of gypsum content, calcium carbonate equivalent, and organic matter. Evidence of the mulching effect of A1v and its contrasting conditions against the underlying A2 is supported by the significant differences in 1: 5 soil/water extracts electrical conductivity, with a July mean EC1:5 of 22.3 dS m(-1) in A1v vs. 14.0 dS m(-1) in A2, and by similar significant differences in all major ions, except Ca. In July, total dryness (0%) can be achieved by A1v whereas A2 retained some moisture (5% minimum). Significant moisture differences were found for A1v and A2 in December together with a homogenizing effect. These are significant traits to be considered both in halophyte germination and establishment studies, and in ecological and restoration plans.

Nutrient inputs versus piscivore biomass as the primary driver of reservoir food webs	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used an ecosystem-based modeling approach, Ecopath with Ecosim, to explore the relative importance of a top-down biotic management lever (top predator introduction) versus a bottom-up abiotic management lever (alteration of nutrient inputs) in regulating biomass in reservoir food webs. To do so, we modeled three Ohio reservoirs that varied in ecosystem productivity. For each, we simulated five hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops x Morone saxatilis) (introduced top predator) biomass levels at three nutrient input levels (n = 15 simulations per reservoir). Nutrient inputs influenced the food web more than introduced predators within each reservoir. Further, across all three reservoirs, the impact of stocked hybrid striped bass on the equilibrium biomass of phytoplankton, prey fish (gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum), and native top predators (e. g., large mouth bass, Micropterus salmoides) was <3%, <14%, and <20%, respectively, of the maximum impact of changes in nutrient inputs on these components. Thus, in mesotrophic to hypereutrophic reservoirs that are dominated by omnivorous gizzard shad, manipulating allochthonous inputs of nutrients offers agencies a more powerful means to regulate food web structure than manipulation of top predator biomass.

J	Dettmers, JM; Wahl, DH; Soluk, DA; Gutreuter, S				Dettmers, JM; Wahl, DH; Soluk, DA; Gutreuter, S			Life in the fast lane: fish and foodweb structure in the main channel of large rivers	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												We studied the main channel of the lower Illinois River and of the Mississippi River just upstream and downstream of its confluence with the Illinois River to describe the abundance, composition, and/or seasonal appearance of components of the main-channel community. Abundance of fishes in the main channel was high, especially adults. Most adult fishes were present in the main channel for either 3 or 4 seasons/y, indicating that fishes regularly reside in the main channel. We documented abundant zooplankton and benthic invertebrates in the main channel, and the presence of these food types in the diets of channel catfish and freshwater drum. All trophic levels were well represented in the main channel, indicating that the main channel supports a unique food web. The main channel also serves as an important energetic link with other riverine habitats (e.g., floodplains, secondary channels, backwater lakes) because of the mobility of resident fishes and because of the varied energy sources supplying this food web. It may be more realistic to view energy flow in large-river systems as a combination of 3 existing concepts, the river continuum concept (downstream transport), the flood pulse concept (lateral transport to the floodplain), and the riverine productivity model (autochthonous production). We urge additional research to quantify the links between the main channel and other habitat types in large rivers because of the apparent importance of main-channel processes in the overall structure and function of large-river ecosystems.

J	Dugan, HA; Lamoureux, SF				Dugan, Hilary A.; Lamoureux, Scott F.			The chemical development of a hypersaline coastal basin in the High Arctic	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated a hypersaline, seasonally isolated marine basin (SIMB) in the Canadian High Arctic to elucidate the role of brine rejection, tidal forcing, and groundwater input over the formation of hypersalinity. Analyses of physical parameters and seasonal sampling of ionic and isotopic composition were carried out on a coastal basin near Shellabear Point, Melville Island, Northwest Territories (75 degrees N, 113 degrees W). Observations reveal daily and seasonal variability in the water column due to a seasonal tidal connection during the ice-free season, which lasts substantially longer than the period of freshwater inflow from the catchment. An ice formation model of the volume of brine rejected from surface ice formed from marine water indicates that rapid saline enrichment of the basin due to ice formation is possible from tidally replenished marine water, and that the current hypersalinity may have formed in less than a decade. Modeled isotopic composition of brines are consistent with observations and provide an alternative to freshwater isotopic dilution suggested by other workers. A tidal connection is a critical consideration in lake evolution, and many hypersaline polar lakes could have developed their current chemical composition before full marine isolation. By contrast, in some coastal lakes, marine stratification caused by ice shelves before isolation provides a setting for minimal brine formation and subsequent meromictic conditions to develop. Hence, the marine setting at the time of isolation represents a key factor in explaining divergent lake chemical evolution in the High Arctic.																			0024-3590					MAR	2011	56	2					495	507		10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0495	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0495													WOS:000290677800007
J	Alfonso, NR				Alfonso, NR			Evidence for two morphotypes of lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, from Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, is generally characterized as a morphologically stable specialized deepwater piscivore. Empirical observations suggested the existence of two or more morphotypes of lake charr in Great Bear Lake, NWT. I gathered morphological data over two seasons from a total of 72 individuals and used principal components analysis to summarize variation in the dataset. UPGMA classification showed that there were two groups in the dataset. I classified individuals into one of two morphotypes using discriminant function analysis. The two forms differed primarily in head proportions. I developed a function, usable in the field, that classifies 80% of all specimens correctly. This study represents one of the first documentations of sympatric morphotypes of lake charr outside the Laurentian Great Lakes and provides the basis for further investigation into origins of and genetic, morphological and ecological differences between the forms.

In this study, a random forest (RF) model was used to investigate the changes of the relationship between water level and discharge of the Yangtze River and local tributaries in Poyang Lake, China, based on daily hydrological data from 1980 to 2018. The results indicated that RF exhibited robust capability for water level prediction in Poyang Lake, with average R-2 of 0.95, 0.88, 0.92, and 0.94 for the dry, rising, wet, and recession seasons, respectively. Predictor importance analysis showed that the discharge of the Yangtze River had greater influence on the water level than the discharge of local tributaries except for the dry season in Poyang Lake, where the influence on the water level was evident with discharge less than 5,000 m(3)/s. The influence of the Yangtze River also showed a clear attenuation pattern as the distance from the outlet of the lake increased, where the water level was constantly regulated by the Yangtze River. In addition, the partial dependence plots also indicated that the Yangtze River discharge changes after the TGD operation have resulted in remarkable water level decreases in the wet and recession seasons, especially for the recession period. Meanwhile, a slight increase in water level was predicted under identical discharge of local catchment in the dry season, which was only concentrated in the outlet of the lake. This study indicated the RF model as a robust technique for water level predictions and attribution analysis under multiple temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, this study confirmed the uneven influences of the Yangtze River and local tributaries on water level across different seasons, gauging stations, and phases.

J	Bockheim, JG; Hinkel, KM				Bockheim, JG; Hinkel, KM			Characteristics and significance of the transition zone in drained thaw-lake basins of the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska	ARCTIC												In the three-component conceptual model of arctic soils, the transition zone is recognized as a layer intermediate between the seasonally thawed active layer above and the stable permafrost below. Although typically frozen and therefore part of the near-surface permafrost, the transition zone episodically thaws over a time period ranging from sub-decadal to multicentennial. From an analysis of 138 pedons from the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, Alaska, we were able to delineate the upper boundary of the transition zone in 78% and the lower boundary in 70% of the pedons. The transition zone exhibits the effects of cryoturbation, contains abundant redistributed organic carbon, is enriched by ice in the forms of lenses, veins, and nets (reticulate vein ice) and has abundant soil moisture. The surface (upper boundary) of the transition zone is found at an average depth of 34 +/- 7 cm below the ground surface and has an average thickness of 23 +/- 8 cm. We observed no significant differences in the thickness of the transition zone or the depth of its boundaries in drained thaw-lake basins ranging in age from 300 to 5500 years BP, suggesting that the processes leading to the development of this zone occur rapidly in Arctic Alaska. Recognition of the transition zone has implications for understanding pedogenic processes in permafrost-affected soils and for determining the response of near-surface permafrost to climate warming.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2005	58	4					406	417		10.14430/arctic454	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic454													WOS:000234189000009
J	Thiet, RK; Boerner, REJ; Nagy, M; Jardine, R				Thiet, RK; Boerner, REJ; Nagy, M; Jardine, R			The effect of biological soil crusts on throughput of rainwater and N into Lake Michigan sand dune soils	PLANT AND SOIL												Biological soil crusts composed of cyanobacteria, green algae, bryophytes, and lichens colonize soils in and and semiarid ecosystems worldwide and are responsible for significant N input to the soils of these ecosystems. Soil crusts also colonize active sand dunes in more humid regions, but studies of structure and function of such sand dune crusts are lacking. We identified the cyanobacterial, algal, and bryophytic constituents and N production and leachates of biological soil crusts that colonize beach dunes at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore along southern Lake Michigan in Indiana, USA. To determine the role of these crusts in this system, we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which intact soil cores with biological crusts were subjected to artificial rainfall over a full growing season. The volume and N content of leachate from the cores were quantified in relation to degree of crust development, taxonomic composition, rainfall volume and intensity, light intensity, and the presence of plant litter. Net N throughput significantly exceeded N inputs to cores in rainwater. Net N outputs from crusts to subsurface soil ranged from 0.01 to 0.19 g NH4+-N m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.01 to 0.61 g NO3 m(-2) yr(-1) stop. Thus, total inorganic N inputs associated with biological soil crusts ranged from 0.02 g N m(-2) stop yr(-1) stop to 0.8 g N m(-2) stop yr(-1) stop. High volume (>= 2 cm) rainfall resulted in more N leaching than low volume events, and plant litter added over the surface of crusted soil cores significantly increased the amount of N in leachate. Exploratory path analysis revealed direct and indirect linkages among environmental factors, crust development, and crust composition in regulating the throughput of H2O and N from these intact soil cores. Biological soil crusts at this site, combined with other properties of the soil surface, substantially increase N inputs to this water- and nutrient-limited sand dune ecosystem.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2005	278	1-2					235	251		10.1007/s11104-005-8550-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-8550-9													WOS:000233643000020
J	Bonner, TH; Wilde, GR				Bonner, TH; Wilde, GR			Changes in the Canadian River fish assemblage associated with reservoir construction	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The fish assemblage of the Canadian River in Texas historically was dominated by Hybognathus placitus and Notropis girardi. These species represented > 90% of fishes collected from the Canadian River in 1954-1955. Construction of two reservoirs on the Canadian River in the 1960s (Ute Reservoir, New Mexico, 1962; Lake Meredith, Texas, 1965) altered hydrologic conditions in the river and affected the fish assemblage. Downstream from Ute Reservoir, mean annual discharge decreased by about 38% after impoundment, but N. placitus, N. girardi, and other mainstem species still dominate the assemblage. Downstream from Lake Meredith, mean annual discharge decreased by 76% and the historic mainstem fish assemblage has been almost completely replaced by species that formerly were restricted to tributary streams. The magnitude of post-impoundment changes in the fish assemblage of the Canadian River appears to be related to the degree that discharge has declined, especially during the spawning season.

J	Ye, ZY; Mao, HT; Driscoll, CT				Ye, Zhuyun; Mao, Huiting; Driscoll, Charles T.			Impacts of anthropogenic emissions and meteorology on mercury deposition over lake vs land surface in upstate New York	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Atmospheric deposition is a major input of mercury (Hg) to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. To evaluate Hg pollution mitigation strategies for inland lakes, the two Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie) adjacent to New York State (NYS), and rural land areas of Upstate New York, the relative contributions to atmospheric Hg deposition from anthropogenic emission reductions and meteorological variations were investigated using a regional three-dimensional chemical transport model with detailed Hg and bromine chemistry (CMAQ-newHg-Br). Our simulations suggested that NYS in-state emissions and the Northeastern US emission reductions from 2005 to 2011 did not significantly alter Hg wet and dry deposition in all study areas when averaged over time and space. However, such emission changes significantly altered intensive emission sources (>10 lb/year) with subsequent effects on deposition to nearby water bodies. For the Great Lakes, Hg dry deposition was enhanced by a factor of 2-5 in the adjacent model grids (within distances of similar to 12 km downwind), and the enhancements decreased to negligible values over similar to 50 km distances. Over land, anthropogenic emissions contributed 30% of the spatial variation in Hg dry deposition and 46% in ambient concentrations of gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM). Spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and foliar characteristics were found to affect both Hg wet and dry deposition. Convective precipitation significantly contributed to spatial and seasonal variations (similar to 65%) in Hg wet deposition over both lake and land surfaces, whereas wind speed and surface heat flux were the main factors contributing to the spatial variation in Hg dry deposition over the lake surfaces through their impacts on dry deposition velocities of GOM and PBM. Leaf area index, which regulates deposition velocity, contributed 14% of the spatial variation in dry deposition flux over land. Variation in solar radiation, which influences photochemical formation of GOM and PBM, explained similar to 10% of the spatial variation over lake and land surfaces alike. Findings from our highly focused study suggested broad implications. Future climate change will likely serve to enhance Hg concentrations in biota via increases in Hg dry and wet deposition to varying degrees contingent on land surface type. Hence, liminating the health risks of Hg requires mitigation of both anthropogenic Hg emission hotspots and human-induced climate change.					; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Ye, Zhuyun/ABR-7171-2022	Ye, Zhuyun/0000-0002-6074-228X; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Mao, Huiting/0000-0003-0067-8746; 													0963-9292	1573-3017				DEC	2020	29	10			SI		1590	1601		10.1007/s10646-019-02113-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02113-2		OCT 2019						31586287					WOS:000489466600001

Formation of dissolved gaseous mercury in a tropical lake (Petit-Saut reservoir, French Guiana)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Formation of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and its volatilization from aquatic systems can be considered as a natural attenuation process, which limits the methylation of mercury (Hg) and Hg accumulation in fish. Although gold-mining activity and erosion of tropical soils lead to increased Hg concentration in aquatic systems, little is known about DGM production and distribution in tropical aqueous systems. Our work explores the vertical distribution and principal sources of DGM in a meromictic Amazonian reservoir. Dissolved gaseous mercury measurements carried out in Petit-Saut reservoir (French Guiana, South America) revealed DGM increase in the surface waters and at the bottom layers of the reservoir during the dry season. As in arctic and temperate lakes, high DGM concentrations in surface waters were attributed to sunlight-mediated photochemical processes. Dissolved gaseous mercury concentrations in the anaerobic hypolimnion were larger than in temperate or arctic lakes. In order to elucidate Hg(II) reduction pathways in the bottom layer of tropical reservoir, laboratory Hg(II) reduction experiments were performed with anoxic aqueous suspensions of surface sediments either untreated or treated by gamma-ray and NaN3. Our results indicated that DGM production at the bottom layer of Petit-Saut reservoir was biologically mediated. Dissolved gaseous mercury formation rates in the surface sediment suspensions were of the same order of magnitude as formation rates in freshwater lakes reported in literature.

Total zooplankton abundance varied from 1 x 10(3) to 4.7 x 10(6) ind m(-3). Salinity had a negative effect on the abundance of copepods and rotifers which were absent in the pond with the highest salt concentration (180parts per thousand) in which the number of taxa was low and Artemia or the ciliate Fabrea largely dominated the zooplankton community. Temperature and the presence of Dunaliella salina as prey appeared as key factors in controlling the abundance of Artemia, while organic detritus appeared as important in the diet of Fabrea. Change in zooplankton species composition along the hypersaline gradient (40-90parts per thousand) was primarily related to salinity. However, our data suggest the importance of both the abundance and composition of food in the spatial and temporal variations of some zooplankton species.

Toxicity of waters from the Rochester Embayment Area of Concern to the plankton species Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Ceriodaphnia dubia	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lower Genesee River and Rochester Embayment of Lake Ontario are a designated Area of Concern (AOC) under the binational Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The "degradation of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations" or plankton Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) was classified as unknown and in need of further assessment in this AOC because water quality data suggested plankton communities could be effected and community data were either unavailable or indicated impacts. The plankton BUI may now be obsolete because local contaminant sources have been largely eliminated. The present study was conducted between July 2013 and August 2014 to assess the BUI-removal criteria: "AOC plankton bioassays confirm that toxicity in ambient waters (Le., no growth inhibition) is not significantly higher than comparable non-AOC controls". Acute and chronic toxicity of waters from 13 sites were quantified seasonally using standardized bioassays with the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and water flea Ceriodaphnia dubia to test the hypothesis that toxicity of waters from AOC sites was not higher than that of waters from comparable non-AOC reference sites. Survival and reproduction of C. dubia did not differ significantly between site types, systems, or months. The growth of P. subcapitata did not differ between site types, but differed among systems and months. All results indicate that waters from AOC sites were no more toxic to both plankton species than waters from reference sites. Assuming test species represent natural plankton assemblages, water quality should not negatively affect survival and growth of resident plankton populations in the Rochester Embayment AOC.

Our objective was to provide a better understanding of the lake's ecosystem dynamics under different forcing mechanisms. Simulations and validation were performed over a dry month period. Wind speed ranged between 0 and 7.7 m s(-1), whilst air temperature ranged between 22.0 and 35.6 A degrees C. Advective transport driven by wind stress was the dominant physical force that shaped the water quality variations during the dry season. Convective circulation intermittently influenced the circulation during calm conditions. Nutrient concentration and stratification of dissolved oxygen (DO) varied between the lakes. Wind events saw patterns of the surface DO concentrations move spatially in the direction of the wind. The ecosystem model simulation suggested that the water quality in Chini Lake was influenced by macrophyte production, although the dissolved and particulate organic carbon accounted for the major fraction of organic matter content in the lake.

J	van Dijk, HFG; Guicherit, R				van Dijk, HFG; Guicherit, R			Atmospheric dispersion of current-use pesticides: A review of the evidence from monitoring studies	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					Workshop on Fate of Pesticides in the Atmosphere Implications for Risk Assessment	APR 22-24, 1998	DRIEBERGEN, NETHERLANDS					Recently, evidence has accumulated that the extensive use of modern pesticides results in their presence in the atmosphere at many places throughout the world. In Europe over 80 current-use pesticides have been detected in rain and 30 in air. Similar observations have been made in North America. The compounds most often looked for and detected are the organochlorine insecticide lindane and triazine herbicides, especially atrazine. However, acetanilide and phenoxyacid herbicides, as well as organophosphorus insecticides have also frequently been found in rain and air. Concentrations in air normally range from a few pg/m(3) to many ng/m(3). Concentrations in rain generally range from a few ng/L to several mu g/L. In fog even higher concentrations are observed. Deposition varies between a few mg/ha/y and more than 1 g/ha/y per compound. However, these estimates are usually based on the collection and analysis of (bulk) precipitation and do not include dry particle deposition and gas exchange. Nevertheless, model calculations, analysis of plant tissue, and first attempts to measure dry deposition in a more representative way, all indicate that total atmospheric deposition probably does not normally exceed a few g/ha/y. So far, little attention has been paid to the presence of transformation products of modern pesticides in the atmosphere, with the exception of those of triazine herbicides, which have been looked for and found frequently. Generally, current-use pesticides are only detected at elevated concentrations in air and rain during the application season. The less volatile and more persistent ones, such as lindane, but to some extent also triazines, are present in the atmosphere in low concentrations throughout the year. In agricultural areas, the presence of modern pesticides in the atmosphere can be explained by the crops grown and pesticides used on them. They are also found in the air and rain in areas where they are not used, sometimes even in remote places, just like their organochlorine predecessors. Concentrations and levels are generally much lower there. These data suggest that current-use pesticides can be transported through the atmosphere over distances of tens to hundreds, and sometimes even more than a thousand kilometres. The relative importance of these atmospheric inputs varies greatly. For mountainous areas and remote lakes and seas, the atmosphere may constitute the sole route of contamination by pesticides. In coastal waters, on the other hand, riverine inputs may prevail. To date, little is known about the ecological significance of these aerial inputs.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	1999	115	1-4					21	70		10.1023/A:1005293020536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005293020536													WOS:000083023300003

The intriguing dynamics of Rastrineobola argentea fishery in the Kenyan waters of Lake Victoria	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Lake Victoria ecosystem once hosted a diverse fish community dominated by a large species flock of haplochromine cichlids. Today this fish assemblage is highly altered by anthropogenic activities, with at least half of the indigenous species either extinct or very rare. The fishery has been reduced to three fishes of economic importance: introduced Nile Perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and Indigenous Minnow, Rastrineobola argentea, locally known as Omena. Decline in fish stocks in the lake is still continuing; however, in order to rejuvenate stocks therein, a fishing ban (closed season) was imposed in November, 2001 between 1 April and 31 July of each year through a Kenyan government gazette and legal notice (L.N.214/2003). The ban was not only intended to protect the Omena fishery but was also used to anchor efforts towards protecting and rejuvenating dwindling stocks in the lake. However, whether the Kenyan approach has made any gains for the region is still equivocal. It is on this basis that we reviewed existing information on both historical and current stock levels of R. argentea, and the closed fishery implication on the livelihoods of the riparian communities. Our review results indicate that Omena biomass in Lake Victoria has increased considerably from approximately 500,000 MT in 2001 to 911,328 MT in 2011. Rastrineobola argentea is now the most important fish stock by mass in Kenyan waters contributing almost 61.5% of the total fish landings (10,339.0 MT), with ex-vessel value of total fishers' earnings of about Kshs. 207 million (approx. USD 2.5 million). In response to the emerging uncertainties regarding the closed season or ban, we recommend and advise for a balanced, win-win approach balancing the biological cycle of stocks against the socio-political and economic issues, in order to sustain the stocks and enable the fisher folks to eke their daily food and earnings.

J	Dube, A; Jayaraman, G				Dube, Anumeha; Jayaraman, Girija			Mathematical modelling of the seasonal variability of plankton in a shallow lagoon	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS & APPLICATIONS												The quality of coastal waters can be markedly influenced by the growth and distribution of phytoplankton. In this study, a non-linear mathematical model is used to explain the seasonal variability of plankton in shallow coastal lagoons. A local stability analysis for dynamical systems is undertaken in order to estimate the range of values of model parameters. Numerical experiments and sensitivity tests with different parameters show that of the thirteen parameters in the model, the main parameter affecting the productivity is the growth rate of the phytoplankton, which depends on light and nutrients. The time of maximum planktonic growth, in particular, is mostly dependent upon the parameter values within the growth rate term. As a case study, the model is then applied to Chilika Lagoon (19 degrees 28'N-19 degrees 54'N and 85 degrees 06'E-85 degrees 36'E), the largest brackish water lagoon with estuarine character on the east coast of India. Interest in detailed analysis of the ecology of the lagoon and the various factors affecting it is due to the opening of the new mouth on 23 September 2000 to resolve the threat to its environment from various factors - eutrophication, weed proliferation, siltation, industrial pollution and depletion of bioresources. The model is tested for different sectors of the lagoon which have distinct characteristics in terms of depth, light penetration, nutrients and hence planktonic growth. A fine-tuning of the model parameters, with the help of the stability analysis discussed for a general model, was performed in order to validate the model results with the data available for the lagoon. Even in its simplest form, the model is able to reproduce most of the significant characteristics of the planktonic distribution in the lagoon - the bimodal oscillations, and major plankton peaks.

J	Wilcox, DA; Sweat, MJ; Carlson, ML; Kowalski, KP				Wilcox, DA; Sweat, MJ; Carlson, ML; Kowalski, KP			A water-budget approach to restoring a sedge fen affected by diking and ditching	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY					7th INTECOL Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS					A vast, ground-water-supported sedge fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA was ditched in the early 1900 s in a failed attempt to promote agriculture. Dikes were later constructed to impound seasonal sheet surface flows for waterfowl management. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which now manages the wetland as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge, sought to redirect water flows from impounded C-3 Pool to reduce erosion in downstream Walsh Ditch, reduce ground-water losses into the ditch, and restore sheet flows of surface water to the peatland. A water budget was developed for C-3 Pool, which serves as the central receiving and distribution body for water in the affected wetland. Surface-water inflows and outflows were measured in associated ditches and natural creeks, ground-water flows were estimated using a network of wells and piezometers, and precipitation and evaporation/evapotranspiration components were estimated using local meteorological data. Water budgets for the 1999 springtime peak flow period and the 1999 water year were used to estimate required releases of water from C-3 Pool via outlets other than Walsh Ditch and to guide other restoration activities. Refuge managers subsequently used these results to guide restoration efforts, including construction of earthen darns in Walsh Ditch upslope from the pool to stop surface flow, installation of new water-control structures to redirect surface water to sheet flow and natural creek channels, planning seasonal releases from C-3 Pool to avoid erosion in natural channels, stopping flow in downslope Walsh Ditch to reduce erosion, and using constructed earthen dams and natural beaver dams to flood the ditch channel below C-3 Pool. Interactions between ground water and surface water are critical for maintaining ecosystem processes in many wetlands, and management actions directed at restoring either ground- or surface-water flow patterns often affect both of these components of the water budget. This approach could thus prove useful in guiding restoration efforts in many hydrologically altered and managed wetlands worldwide.

Lake Puma Yumco (28degrees34'N, 90degrees24'E) has the following morphometric properties: maximum length 31km, maximum width 14km, mean width 9km, shoreline 90 km, surface area 280 km(2), and shoreline development 1.5. Transparency was approximately 10m, even in the thawing season. The extinction coefficient of the lake water was calculated as 0.15m(-1). Annual maximum transparency was estimated from the depth of the Chara zone to be 30m. Dissolved oxygen was 7mg O-2 l(-1) and showed saturated values, and salinity was 360mg l(-1). The chemical type of the lake water was Mg-Ca-HCO3-SO4, and it was slightly alkaline in character. Total nitrogenous nutrients (sum of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and urea nitrogen), phosphate, and silicate were extremely low at 1, 0.02, and 9muM, respectively. Dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations were 160, 11, and 0.08muM and the molar ratio was calculated as 2100:140:1. Chlorophyll a concentration was 0.2mg m(-3). Phytoplankton and zooplankton were dominated by Aphanocapsa sp. and Diaptomidae. Both nitrogen and phosphorus appear to be the limiting parameters for phytoplankton growth. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents in lake sediments were low and the sediments contained a large amount of CaCO3. The grain size of sediment was that of silt-sand in most cases. The present results indicate that the pre-Himalayan alpine freshwater Lake Puma Yumco is an ultraoligotrophic lake.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2003	4	3					167	175		10.1007/S10201-003-0101-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/S10201-003-0101-6													WOS:000187075200007

Some of these compartments may be considered as the most critical zones because they encompass severe changes in the recent past and one of the geomorphological features mostly impacted by these changes are the Amazon floodplains. In this study we report data from a floodplain lake, Quistococha, in Peru. The sediment was dated, radiographed, described and bulk density, granulometry, mineral composition, and total organic carbon were determined. Two distinctive sedimentary depositional phases were identified. During the first one, between 6100 and 5600 cal years BP, Quistococha Lake was strongly influenced by the Amazon River constraining high sediment accumulation rates. The influence of Amazon River decreased and ceased around 5600 cal years BP, due to an avulsion of the River toward its present-day position. Between 5600 and 2600 cal years BP a gap in sedimentation is observed, probably related to the dry mid-Holocene climate conditions. The sedimentation re-started about 2600 cal years BP, now the lake is an isolated lake. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Capoeta erhani Turan, Kottelat et Ekmekci, 2008 has an economic importance in commercial and recreational fisheries in Turkey. Knowledge of the biology of this species is very scarce. Despite the importance of this species, no research on the population dynamics such as age and growth rates has been conducted. The aim of this study was to determine the age, growth rate, and the relations between the fish size and the otolith size for C. erhani from the Menzelet Reservoir, Turkey. Materials and methods. This study was carried out seasonally in the Menzelet Reservoir, between January and December 2012. Samples were collected using gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 18 to 30 mm. Results. A total of 134 otoliths obtained from Capoeta erhani that ranged from 15 to 33.8 cm TL were used in the analyses. The overall male : female ratio (M : F = 1.25 : 1.00) was biased in favour of males. The Mann-Whitney test revealed significant differences between sexes, regarding TL (P < 0.05). The calculated length-weight relations were W = 0.0097TL(3.0015) (r(2)= 0.986) for females, W = 0.0054TL(3.2011) (r(2) = 0.975) for males and W = 0.0075TL(3.0892) (r(2) = 0.979) for all specimens. The von Bertalanffy growth models were L-infinity = 33.83 cm (TL), K = 0.964, t(0) = -0.573 for females; L-infinity = 32.02 cm (TL), K = 0.843, t(0) = -0.562 for males; L-infinity = 33.85 cm (TL), K = 0.821, t(0) = -0.482 for all specimens. Conclusion. This study provides the first information on age, growth, and otolith morphometric parameters of Capoeta erhani. Determining the parameters of C. erhani age and growth rates will lead to the estimates of relevant parameters of population dynamics and to better understanding of the long-term changes of the stock sizes.

It lies in a fertile semi-arid basin. The Lake has no surface water outlet and is presumed to be under stress. Dissolved metals are directly taken up by bacteria, algae, plants, and planktonic and benthic organisms. Dissolved metals can also adsorb to particulate matter in water column and enter aquatic organisms through various routes. Cadmium, copper, lead and zinc may bioaccumulate within lower organisms, yet they do not biomagnify up the food chain as do mercury and selenium. This study reports on the levels and distribution of dissolved heavy metals and investigates the influence of physicochemical parameters on metal mobilization. The bioavailability of selected metals was investigated by relating the levels of dissolved metals to that in fish. Water abstraction for irrigation and domestic use, compounded with organic matter inflow will affect physicochemical parameters and hence influences the mobilization of heavy metals. Dissolved Zn correlated highly with sediment pH (r = 0.67) indicating that dissolution increases with increase in pH. In addition, the fact that the pH also correlated positively with organic matter r = 0.50, Eh r = 0.63, temperature r = 0.56 and dissolved oxygen r = 56, would suggest that organic bound Zn contributed significantly to the concentration of dissolved Zn. In situ flux experiments indicated that the fringing papyrus reeds located along the shores of Lake Naivasha provided sites for metal immobilization due to their coprecipitation on redox sensitive.

Results showed that cyanobacterium Phormidium tenue was the predominant species; twenty-six cyanobacteria species were identified in water samples collected from the two reservoirs, among which fourteen were identified with the morphological method and sixteen with the PCR-DGGE method. The cyanobacteria community composition analysis showed a seasonal fluctuation from July to December. The cyanobacteria population peaked in August in both reservoirs, with cell abundances of 3.78 x 10(8) cells L-1 and 1.92 x 10(8) cells L-1 in the Tiegang and Shiyan reservoirs, respectively. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied to further investigate the correlation between cyanobacteria community dynamics and environmental factors. The result indicated that the cyanobacteria community dynamics was mostly correlated with pH, temperature and total nitrogen. This study demonstrated that data obtained from PCR-DGGE combined with a traditional morphological method could reflect cyanobacteria community dynamics and its correlation with environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater bodies.

This analysis develops a climatology of non-lake-effect snow squall events in southern New England for 1994-2018 and investigates the synoptic environment and mesoscale factors conducive to their formation. NationalWeather Service surface observations were used to identify events; sea level pressure maps, composite radar charts, and a cell-tracking algorithm were used to determine their organization and movement; and ERA5 hourly reanalysis data were used to analyze the associated synoptic and infer mesoscale features, as well as convective and symmetric instability. A total of 100 events were identified and categorized into four distinct types on the basis of the direction of movement of the associated radar echoes, which is closely linked to characteristic synoptic structures and mesoscale factors. The four types are Classic (squall movement from the northwest; 72 events), Atlantic (from the southwest; 15 events), Northern (from the north; 9 events), and Special (varying; 4 events). All types have a 500-hPa trough over the Northeast but differ in the structure of the trough and its relation to lower-level flow, which accounts for the differences in movement of the squalls. The snow events occur in shallow, convective squall lines, and the ingredients for convection were present in all cases. Both upright and symmetric instability are typically present, all cases had at least one lower-tropospheric layer with cyclonic differential vorticity advection, and many cases were also associated with frontogenesis.

In this study, we selected a typical floodplain-lake system to explore the seasonal role of coupled C and Si as mat-ter is imported and exported through lotic water processes. Results showed considerably higher dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved to-tal carbon (DTC) concentrations during the transitional stage between the dry and wet season (here referred to as TDW) compared to the other seasonal stages (5.81 mg/L-28.80 mg/L), indicating that imported runoff significantly effects the transport of C and Si. Rock weathering was the main source of dissolved silicon (DSi). The dilution effect and water temperature may also impact DIC, DOC, and DTC concentrations. Except for the wet sea-son, Bacillariophyta was the dominant phytoplankton taxon, and diatom growth as well as the growth of other algae taxon may influence DSi and DTC concentrations through sev-eral biochemical processes.

Seasonal and interannual variability of residence time and total phosphorus in a small hypereutrophic lake in the Brazilian northeast	WATER SA												This study evaluates the residence time (RT) and total phosphorus (TP) in a small hypereutrophic lake in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. The results indicate that RT predicted by a complete-mix model is very similar (R-2 = 0.83) to that simulated with a 2-D hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2). Simple power-laws were fitted to describe RT and TP concentration at the lake inlet as functions of lake inflow, yielding correlations of R-2 = 0.84 and 0.70, respectively. The combination of these correlations with a complete-mix approach provided a comprehensive model that predicted TP values measured at the lake outlet reasonably well (R-2 = 0.60). In addition, a direct empirical correlation between simulated TP concentration and precipitation was also obtained. The simulations indicate a nearly periodic behaviour of RT and TP, with the seasonal variations being much higher than the interannual ones. Finally, an application of the model showed that a reduction of 99% of the input TP load was required to reach 100% compliance with the required water quality standards; this could be achieved by connecting the residences to the sewage network. The methodology proposed in this research can be easily applied to other lakes in the Brazilian northeast and extended to other tropical regions around the globe.

At the same time, this complex orography creates diverse precipitation regimes (unimodal, bimodal, and three-modal) that make it difficult to establish a relationship with the local amount. Nevertheless, stations along these regions show a similar intra-annual isotopic variability, with lower values during MAM and ON. In contrast, higher values are found during DJF and JAS in a w-shaped pattern, suggesting a common regional controller. A monthly delta H-2(p) and delta O-18(p) collection campaign was established in Central Ecuador (n = 30) to complement stations biased towards the northern and southern parts. Based on back trajectory analysis, the results demonstrated that moisture arrives from two primary sources: the Tropical North Atlantic (DJFM) and the Amazon Basin (JAS). Nevertheless, their convergence (AMJ and ON) is the crucial factor modulating the lowest isotopic values. Precisely, this convergence is stronger at the V-Index region (5 degrees S-5 degrees N, 65 degrees-75 degrees W), where the wind seasonality and reversal at low levels are enhanced, allowing the inter-hemispheric moisture flux transport (cross-equatorial flow). We propose that the amount of rainfall located at the V-Index region is a more robust approach for explaining the delta H-2(p) and delta O-18(p) variability rather than the local amount.

However, there are still limitations in understanding how different sampling scales affect the spatial heterogeneity of Rs and whether the spatial scale effect will change with habitat types. Our objectives were to explore the effects of different sampling scales on the spatial variability of Rs and the relative importance of soil abiotic characteristics and plant traits in influencing the spatial variability of Rs. The Rs, soil properties, and plant traits were measured through field investigation and indoor analysis in the Tugai forest desert plant community in the Ebinur Lake Basin in northwest China. The Rs showed significant water gradient changes, with a coefficient of variation of 35.4%-58%. Plot types had significant effects on Rs, while the change of sampling scale did not lead to significant differences in Rs. At the plot scale, Rs spatial variation at the 5 m x 5 m sampling scale mainly depended on plant traits (leaf length, leaf thickness, leaf dry matter content, and leaf phosphorus content, p < 0.05), while Rs spatial variation at the 10 m x 10 m scale mainly depended on soil properties (soil total phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, soil water content, and pH, p < 0.05). At the local scale, soil nutrients (soil available phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen) and plant traits (maximum plant height, leaf length, and phosphorus content) at the 5 m x 5 m scale jointly explained 49% of the spatial change of Rs. In contrast, soil microclimate (soil water content), soil nutrients (soil pH, available phosphorus, and nitrate nitrogen), and plant traits (leaf thickness) jointly explained 51% of the spatial variation of Rs at the 10 m x 10 m scale. These results demonstrate the potential to predict the spatial variability of Rs based on the combination of easily measured aboveground functional traits and soil properties, which provides new ideas and perspectives for further understanding the mechanism of Rs change in Tugai forests.

Wetlands, the transitional zones that occupy an intermediate position between dryland and open water, regulate the ? ow of water and nutrients, thereby facilitating optimum functioning of the physical and biological cycles of nature. Harike wetland in the Indian State of Punjab has been declared a wetland of international importance. Thus it is felt necessary to reclaim and develop Harike wetland for its optimum potential use, but a reliable and accurate wetland database is not available. This study aimed at the generation of a database in terms of landuse/landcover, extent of waterspread and its seasonal variation, aquatic vegetation status and turbidity levels of lake water, using multidate satellite data. The threats of the Harike wetland have been identified and adequate measures for its conservation and management suggested.																			0143-1161					JAN	2001	22	1					89	98		10.1080/014311601750038866	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/014311601750038866													WOS:000165844400006
J	Bozau, E; Göttlicher, J; Stärk, HJ				Bozau, Elke; Goettlicher, Joerg; Staerk, Hans-Joachim			Rare earth element fractionation during the precipitation and crystallisation of hydrous ferric oxides from anoxic lake water	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												An enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREE) is characteristic for most of the acidic, Fe- and SO4-rich pit lakes and groundwaters in the lignite mining area of Lower Lusatia (Germany). One of these acidic lakes - the pit lake "RL 1223" - has a strong thermal and chemical stratification. The upper water layer (0-9 m) shows pH values of about 3 during all seasons. The monimolimnion (10-17 m) of the lake is anoxic and has pH values of about 7. The rare earth element (REE) patterns of the upper lake water show enriched LREE (La-N/Yb-N = 1.6) whereas the opposite patterns (depletion of LREE, La-N/Yb-N = 0.4) are found in the anoxic water of the monimolimnion. Experiments were conducted to observe the behaviour of REE during Fe oxidation in water from the monimolimnion (depth 14 m). The sampled monimolimnion water was placed in plastic bottles, and the changing water chemistry was observed for 40 weeks after sampling. Due to the initial anoxic conditions almost all Fe precipitated in the investigated water, and the pH value decreased from about 7 to 3 during the oxidation. The Fe precipitates are identified as ferrihydrite which is transformed into goethite within the oxidation process. Stable pH conditions (pH 3.0) were reached after about 10 weeks of oxidation. The original REE patterns of the investigated water are generally reflected in the Fe precipitates collected at the beginning of the experiment as well as after up to 40 weeks of oxidation. However, in the corresponding water LREE were temporally enriched with a maximum La-N/Yb-N ratio of 1.0 and a maximum La-N/Sm-N ratio of 2.3 after 6 weeks of oxidation time (pH 3.8-4.9). Although complex geochemical changes took place between the start and the end of the experiment REE patterns observed at these points in time are nearly identical. These differences of the REE pattern can be explained by the sampling procedure. The experimental findings can be transmitted to the mining dump aquifers of the study area where geochemical conditions comparable to the experimental oxidation time from 3 to 6 weeks are found and hydrous ferric oxides are precipitating. Groundwater passing through the mining dumps can preferentially desorb LREE from the Fe precipitates and display the typical LREE enrichment and carry it to the epilimnion of the acidic pit lakes in Lower Lusatia.

To assess the biomonitoring potential of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm Adenoscolex oreini and the possible impact of water quality on fish species, a study was carried out in three lakes with marked eutrophication and pollution gradients. The A. oreini infection level in three host fish species of the genus Schizothorax and corresponding fish health status were determined. The pattern of cestode infection varied significantly in the three fish species across the pollution gradient. The prevalence of infection in two fish species (Schizothorax esocinus and S. curvifrons) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the eutrophic lake than in the reference lake, whereas in S. niger, the maximum was reached in the hypereutrophic lake. The estimated marginal mean intensity and other infection indices varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the inter and intra-pollution gradients of lakes. Multivariate statistical analysis results revealed maximum cestode infection in the eutrophic lake. An altered seasonal pattern was observed in the highly stressed lake. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor values were significantly greater in fish collected from the reference lake than in those collected from the other lakes. A significant negative relationship between GSI and cestode prevalence was observed in the hypereutrophic lake as compared to least eutrophic lake. These findings indicate that infection indices of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm and health attributes of fish can act as surrogates for the environmental quality of deteriorated lentic water bodies of the north-western Himalayan region, which is currently undergoing environmental degradation.					; zargar, ummer/AAT-2979-2021	Rather, Mohmmad Irshad/0000-0002-6968-4880; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2017	81						503	513		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.025													WOS:000417229100049
J	Gaedke, U; Seifried, A; Adrian, R				Gaedke, U; Seifried, A; Adrian, R			Biomass size spectra and plankton diversity in a shallow eutrophic lake	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Biomass size spectra collate structural and functional attributes of plankton communities enabling standardised temporal and cross-system comparisons and may be rapidly obtained by automated particle counters. To examine how differences in plankton communities from highly eutrophic and more oligotrophic lakes are reflected in size spectra, a three-year time series of biomass size spectra was established for polymictic, eutrophic Lake Maggelsee, based on approximately weekly sampling and microscopic enumeration. The continuous but often bumpy size spectra reflected appropriately the seasonal and trophy-related variations in the plankton composition and growth conditions and the potential impact of daphnids on smaller plankton. We tested the hypothesis that more diverse plankton communities have smoother size spectra than impoverished ones. The spectra of Lake Muggelsee and other more or less eutrophic lakes covaried roughly with the functional diversity in total plankton composition but were unrelated to taxonomical diversity within the phyto- or mesozooplankton. The slopes of the normalised size spectra of Lake Muggelsee were generally more negative than -1, exhibited a recurrent seasonal pattern and were strongly correlated with crustacean biomass. In contrast to less eutrophic systems, slopes could not be used to quantify energy fluxes within the food web due to highly variable algal P/B ratios and frequently bumpy size distributions. The latter indicated stronger deviations from the ideal concept of a steady energy flow along the size gradient than found in e.g. large, mesotrophic Lake Constance.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2004	89	1					1	20		10.1002/iroh.200310661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200310661													WOS:000189195400001

Updated species checklist of fishes from Lake Dongting in Hunan Province, South China: Species diversity and conservation	ZOOKEYS												A lack of an updated checklist of freshwater fish species from Lake Dongting is a great hindrance to further biodiversity analysis. A seasonal survey of fishes in the lake was conducted from October 2017 to January 2019. Based on the data obtained during the field survey and coupled with known literature and the latest taxonomic development of relevant taxa, the species checklist of fishes from Lake Dongting was updated. A total of 130 species from 12 orders, 30 families and 76 genera has been documented, containing 126 native species and four alien species. Its fish fauna is dominated by the Xenocyprididae that has the highest number of included species (30), followed by the Gobionidae (25) and Acheilognathidae (11). This checklist comprises 20 species undergoing nomenclatural changes and 11 new records, eight of which are native and three exotic. It excludes 20 species, which have been reported in error in historical works, due to synonyms, erroneous records, taxonomic changes and unconfirmed records. Unsampled in this survey were 34 species that are ecologically specialised: migratory, rheophilic, predatory, shellfish-dependent or pelagic-egg-spawning. While some of these species eluded capture likely due to the paucity of population, others may have been extirpated in Lake Dongting perhaps owing to human perturbations, such as river damming across affluents or the Chang-Jiang mainstem, sand dredging, overfishing or water pollution. The updated checklist lays a sound foundation for biodiversity conservation of fishes in Lake Dongting.

C.; Pouilly, Marc			Seasonal oxygen isotope variations in freshwater bivalve shells as recorders of Amazonian rivers hydrogeochemistry	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												Freshwater bivalve shell oxygen isotope values (delta O-18(S)) may act as a recorder of river delta O-18 variations that can then be interpreted in terms of hydrology (e.g. precipitation-evaporation balance, precipitation and river discharge patterns). We investigated the potential of this proxy measured across the hinge of South American unionid shells: Anodontites elongatus collected in Peru and A. trapesialis in Brazil. The isotopic signatures were reproducible between individuals of the same species. A. trapesialis clearly showed a strong delta O-18(S) cyclicity in accordance with its growth patterns while A. elongatus presented less clear delta O-18(S) with lower amplitude. We confirm that the deposition of successive growth lines and increments is annual, with growth line corresponding to the wet season. Also, we suggest that low amplitude of delta O-18(S) in the A. elongatus shells indicates a habitat close to the river while large amplitude of delta O-18(S) cycles observed in A. trapesialis shells would reflect a floodplain lake habitat, seasonally disconnected from the river and thus subjected to higher seasonal fluctuations in water delta O-18. Considering these promising first results, future studies could be directed towards the use of fossil shells to reconstruct the past and present hydrological and geochemical conditions of the Amazon.					; Freitas, Carlos/I-5386-2012; Lazareth, Claire/Q-3070-2017; Pouilly, Marc/E-9119-2014; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014	Dufour, Elise/0000-0001-8865-7055; Lazareth, Claire E./0000-0001-7167-0800; Pouilly, Marc/0000-0003-4209-3367; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998; LESTRELIN, Hugo/0000-0002-4226-2098													1025-6016	1477-2639				NOV 2	2019	55	6					511	525		10.1080/10256016.2019.1666120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2019.1666120		SEP 2019						31533477					WOS:000486880400001

Our goals were (1) to assess the relative importance of chronic warming (with field greenhouses) and increased N and P availability (by fertilization) in controlling gross ecosystem photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration (plant plus heterotrophic respiration), and ultimately ecosystem C balance; and (2) to attempt to partition ecosystem responses to these treatments between plant and soil contributions. We present results of the effects of these manipulations on whole-system CO2 exchange over seasonal and diel cycles, and on nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration using in situ soil incubations. Wet sedge control plots were, at best, a weak sink for carbon even during the peak growing season. Chronic nutrient additions of N + P shifted wet sedge carbon balance to a strong sink throughout the growing season; nutrient availability regulated seasonal and diel CO2 exchanges in these two wet sedge ecosystems. The N + P plots had significantly higher photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration in spite of the unanticipated effect of similar to 30% reduction in thaw depth in these plots, apparently due to a twofold increase in litter accumulation insulating the soil surface and/or possible shading from greater plant cover in these plots. These results highlighted the prevailing importance of nutrient-carbon interactions in controlling ecosystem processes and ecosystem C balance in arctic tundra. In contrast, warming had only subtle effects on CO2 exchanges. Increased temperatures in the warmed plots had little effect on instantaneous rates of photosynthesis or respiration. After eight years of chronic warming with an average 5.6 degrees C higher air temperature over the growing season and a 40-200% increase in net N mineralization rate, it was surprising that warming did not have more profound effects on CO2 exchange and plant cover. If there were an effect of warming, increased temperatures might cause early canopy development and lengthen the growing season, rather than directly affect instantaneous rates of photosynthesis, Based on photosynthesis-light response curves developed from the early- and late-season diel measurements, we demonstrated that the main effect of warming was to accelerate the development of the canopy early in the season. By midseason, however, there were no significant differences in C exchange between warmed and control plots. Perhaps the most important and novel result emerging from this study is the prevailing importance of plant C exchange, not soil processes, in driving ecosystem C fluxes. First, nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration as estimated CO2 flux from in situ soil incubations was a small fraction of whole-system respiration and did not vary among treatments. This suggests that anaerobic conditions or some other factor may limit soil microbial respiration more than do temperature or nutrients. Second, plant respiration contributed most (90%) of the ecosystem respiration in fertilized plots. This unanticipated and large contribution from plant respiration highlights the critical importance of understanding the response of plant respiration to global environmental change in these wet sedge ecosystems.

Eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) from four ice-on seasons between 2014 and 2019 are compared to three different bulk transfer models: one with a constant transfer coefficient and two with stability-adjusted transfer coefficients: the Lake Heat Flux Analyzer and SEA-ICE. All three models correlate well with the EC results in general while typically underestimating the magnitude and the standard deviation of the flux in comparison to the EC observations. Differences between the models are small, with the constant transfer coefficient model performing slightly better than the stability-adjusted models. Small difference in temperature and humidity between surface and air results in low correlation between models and EC. During melting periods (surface temperature T-0 > 0 degrees C), the model performance for LE decreases when compared to the freezing periods (T-0 < 0 degrees C), while the opposite is true for H. At low wind speed, EC shows relatively high fluxes (+/- 20 W m(-2)) for H and LE due to non-local effects that the bulk models are not able to reproduce. The complex topography of the lake surroundings creates local violations of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, which helps explain this counterintuitive result. Finally, the uncertainty in the estimation of the surface temperature and humidity affects the bulk heat fluxes, especially when the differences between surface and air values are small.					; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016	Kohonen, Kukka-Maaria/0000-0001-9258-1225; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356													1991-959X	1991-9603				JUN 21	2022	15	12					4739	4755		10.5194/gmd-15-4739-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4739-2022													WOS:000813456800001
J	Adams, JK; Finkelstein, SA				Adams, Jennifer K.; Finkelstein, Sarah A.			Watershed-scale reconstruction of middle and late Holocene paleoenvironmental changes on Melville Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Arctic regions have heightened sensitivity to climatic changes, however regional scale differences exist in the magnitude and timing of biotic responses. Melville Peninsula in the east-central Canadian Arctic is a transitional area with respect to modern climate, with a continental climate to the west, and more maritime influences to the east. This, and the presence of Thule archaeological sites, make the Peninsula an area of high importance for paleoclimate reconstructions. Lake sediment cores from two adjacent ultra-oligotrophic and very dilute lakes (SP02 and SP04) from interior Melville Peninsula (68 degrees 33'N and 83 degrees 17'W, 220 m a.s.l.) were analyzed for diatom assemblages (microscopic algae) to track paleoclimatic changes. High magnetic susceptibility, coarse-grained sediments, low organic matter, and lack of diatoms in sediments older than 6000 years BP confirm earlier suggestions of a persistent ice cap on the Peninsula. Peak diatom concentration and biogenic silica, and maximum values for sediment organic matter, between 4400 and 2900 years BP may indicate the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). The timing of the HTM is similar to that of the Baffin region to the east. Decreases in these proxies, as well as small shifts in diatom assemblages following 2900 years BP indicate the advancement of Neoglacial cooling. The changes of the pre-industrial portion of the last millennium were of smaller magnitude than those of the HIM, but subtle changes in diatom assemblages after 750 years BP may be indicative of the Little Ice Age, the timing of which agrees well with that of Boothia Peninsula to the west. The Anthropocene is well marked in these records, with increases in diatom species richness from a pre-industrial maximum of 28-51 diatom species in the modern assemblage at Lake SP02. Planktonic diatoms appear in the 20th century, signalling profound ecological changes associated with longer ice-free seasons. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The shape and crystal structure of the resulting N-doped TiO2 were investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray spectroscopy (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis reflection spectrum. The results showed that doping TiO2 with nitrogen can lower its band gap and apparently shift its optical response to the visible region. Under the visible light (lambda>420 nm) irradiation, the MC-LR was degraded by the synthesized N-TiO2 nano-material. The variation of MC-LR amount and its intermediates were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and LC-MS, respectively. The mineralization of MC-LR was determined by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Simultaneously, transient oxidative species generated during photocatalysis were tracked by electron spin resonance (ESR) and Peroxidase method. All these results indicated that visible-light excited N-TiO2 can activate molecular oxygen and thereby achieve degradation of MC-LR completely within 14 h. The removal of 59% of TOC was achieved after 20 h irradiation. The major oxidative species in the system were hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and H2O2. 13 Kinds of intermediates were primarily identified in the process. Based on these results, a reasonable conclusion was drawn for the degradation of MC-LR wherein its four positions are easy to be attacked by the photo-generated OH radical followed by the hydrolyzation of peptides.					huang, Ying/OKR-7879-2025; Dejiang, Li/I-8134-2016														1674-7291	1869-1870				AUG	2010	53	8					1793	1800		10.1007/s11426-010-4013-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11426-010-4013-0													WOS:000281403400025

From March 2007 to March 2008, the average concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were (1553 +/- 484) mu g.L-1 and (62 +/- 31) mu g.L-1, respectively. The mean value of chlorophyll was (9.07 +/- 0.91) mu g.L-1. The trophic level of XBA was meso-eutrophic, while the general nutrient limitation was phosphorus. The results indicated that XBA has a strong ability to purify itself and has non-point source pollution from terrestrial runoff. The variation of TN/TP ratio was caused by a variation in TN rather than in TP when TN/TP < 22. N-fixation from cyanobacteria occurred and became an important process in overcoming the nitrogen deficit under a low TN/TP ratio. When TN/TP >= 22, the variation of TP affected the TN/TP ratio more significantly than TN. The increase of TP in XBA was caused mainly by particulate phosphorus, which could originate from a non-point source as adsorptive inorganic forms after heavy rainfall and surface runoff. An increase in the river's flow could also contribute to an unstable environment for the growth of phytoplankton.																			1673-7415	1673-7520				SEP	2009	3	3					334	340		10.1007/s11783-009-0039-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-009-0039-y													WOS:000270333700012
J	Rocek, Z; Böttcher, R; Wassersug, R				Rocek, Zbynek; Boettcher, Ronald; Wassersug, Richard			Gigantism in tadpoles of the Neogene frog Palaeobatrachus	PALEOBIOLOGY												We describe three giant palaeobatrachid fossil tadpoles of the genus Palacobatrachus (Nieuwkoop-Faber [NF] stages 60-64) from the Miocene of Randecker Maar, Germany. The largest was 150 mm at the beginning of metamorphosis (stage 60), whereas the smallest was 100 mm and approaching the end of metamorphosis (stage 64). In contrast, normal palaeobatrachid tadpoles and their pipid relatives, both extinct and extant, rarely exceed 60 mm in length. We review here both ecological and pathological conditions that are conducive to the development of gigantism in tadpoles. Tadpoles that lack a thyroid gland become exceptionally large and arrest development at early hindlimb stages (NF stages 53-56). However, the advanced metamorphic stages of the giant Palaeobatrachus tadpoles indicate that they were able to metamorphose, and thus were not athyroid. Environmental factors-pond size and permanence, predators, duration of the growing season - may all contribute to tadpole gigantism in certain extant anuran species. We identify suites of ecological features that distinguish extant anurans, with large tadpoles from high-latitude and high-altitude permanent lakes in temperate regions (e.g., certain Rana and Telmatobius) from tropical species, such as Pseudis paradoxa, whose tadpoles normally achieve large size in temporary seasonal ponds. The paleoecology of Randecker Maar suggests that Palaeobatrachus tadpoles lived in a permanent semitropical lake, but one with few predators.

J	Bially, A; MacIsaac, HJ				Bially, A; MacIsaac, HJ			Fouling mussels (Dreissena spp.) colonize soft sediments in Lake Erie and facilitate benthic invertebrates	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We conducted survey and transplant studies to determine whether colonization and residency on soft sediments by introduced, fouling mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) were affected by physical disturbance, and whether Dreissena presence in turn influenced the diversity and population densities of other benthic invertebrates. Surveys revealed that colony density was typically higher at moderate depths than at shallower and greater ones. However, the largest, midsummer colonies and greatest coverage of sediments by mussels occurred at deeper sites. 2. Disturbance of transplanted colonies varied by depth and colony size, with deeper and larger colonies experiencing the lowest destruction rates. Colony destruction rate was positively correlated with current velocity adjacent to the lakebed. 3. Absence of mussel colonies at shallow sites was not determined by recruitment or substrate limitation, as recruit density was higher and sediment characteristics more suitable for postveliger settlement at shallow than at deeper sites. Rather, seasonal storms have much stronger effects in shallow than in deep water. 4. Mussel residency on soft sediment has profound effects on invertebrate biodiversity. Invertebrate species (taxon) richness and total abundance were positively correlated with mussel colony area. Mussel-sediment habitat supported between 462 and 703% more taxa, and between 202 and 335% more individuals (exclusive of Dreissena) than adjacent soft-sediment lacking mussels. 5. Results from this study illustrate-that physical disturbance directly limits the distribution of mussels on soft sediments, and the diversity and abundance of other benthic invertebrates in consequence.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020														0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2000	43	1					85	97		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00526.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00526.x													WOS:000085242000006
J	Kingston, DG; Webster, CS; Sirguey, P				Kingston, Daniel G.; Webster, Clare S.; Sirguey, Pascal			Atmospheric circulation drivers of lake inflow for the Waitaki River, New Zealand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Hydro-electricity is a critical resource in New Zealand, and as such improved understanding of the drivers of water resource availability is a key research goal. Large-scale atmospheric circulation is the principal driver of surface climate and water resource variability over New Zealand. Focusing on the Waitaki River (located in the South Island; one of the most important rivers for hydro-electricity in New Zealand), a comprehensive analysis is presented of the large-scale atmospheric circulation drivers of monthly inflow to the three main headwater lakes, Ohau, Pukaki and Tekapo. Analyses are undertaken using composite, correlation, partial least-squares (PLS) regression and cross-wavelet analyses. Environment-to-climate composite analysis indicates that variation in lake inflow is driven primarily by the strength of the NE-SW pressure gradient over the three lakes (i.e. parallel to the axis of the Southern Alps, from which the lakes are fed). Relatively strong winds from a north-westerly direction are associated with high lake inflow; weaker winds from a more south-westerly direction occur during times of low inflow. Climate-to-environment composites of lake inflow, together with correlation, PLS and wavelet analysis, indicate that inflow is described well by the MZ1 and MZ2 New Zealand-based circulation indices, but not larger-scale modes of atmospheric circulation. The MZ1 and MZ2 indices have rarely been considered previously as explanatory variables for water resources in the South Island of New Zealand, but here it is suggested that these indices represent a promising new direction for future studies, particularly relating to season-ahead prediction of water resource availability.					; Sirguey, Pascal/B-9550-2008; Kingston, Daniel/ABC-2010-2021	Webster, Clare/0000-0002-6386-6392; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 15	2016	36	3					1102	1113		10.1002/joc.4405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4405													WOS:000371541400005

However, this lake has received little attention for hydrobiological studies, although it is subject to heavy pollution. Therefore, the present study aims to contribute to the monitoring of Lake Aheme, by assessing the diatom flora. For this purpose, eight sites were surveyed during the dry and wet seasons between September 2014 and 2016. Physico-chemical parameters were measured and diatoms were collected using a phytoplankton net. Margalef, Simpson, Shannon-Weaver, Pielou Equitability and Berger-Parker diversity indices showed significant diversity in Lake Aheme. The n-MDS and ANOSIM analyses of the diatom communities showed heterogeneity according to seasons and sites. SIMPER analysis revealed that Aulacoseira granulata, Entomoneis paludosa, Nitzschia sigma, Nitzschia linearis, Tryblionella debilis, Thalassiosira lacustris, Cyclotella sp., Iconella capronii, Iconella robusta and Cerataulina bicornis contributed to the changes in diatom community structure. Redundancy analysis showed that temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen were driving factors in the distribution of diatoms species in Lake Aheme. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean on Lake Aheme is noted through the presence of high salinity tolerant species such as Entomoneis paludosa, Nitzschia closterium, Nitzschia sigma and Coscinodiscus wailesii. Further taxonomic research is needed to better understand diatom ecology and species biogeographical distribution.

Twenty five taxonomic groups, with the dominance of chironomids (79%), were recorded at three stations during the investigation from July 14 to September 8, 2004. Nematodes and large predatory larvae of Zygoptera with 6% were second in dominance, followed by oligochaetes with 5%. Weed-bed invertebrates on C. demersum were more abundant than on Myriophyllum spicatum L. due to different morphology of the host plants. Environmental parameters within C. demersum stands were found in the same range at all stations, but they changed during the season. They indicated eutrophy with the tendency to hypertrophy which is reflected by the composition of the weed-bed invertebrate community.

New site at Olduvai Gorge (AGS, Bed I, 1.84 Mya) widens the range of locations where hominins engaged in butchery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Outstanding questions about human evolution include systematic connections between critical landscape resources-such as water and food-and how these shaped the competitive and biodiverse environment(s) that our ancestors inhabited. Here, we report fossil n-alkyl lipid biomarkers and their associated delta C-13 values across a newly discovered Olduvai Gorge site (AGS) dated to 1.84 million years ago, enabling a multiproxy analysis of the distributions of critical local landscape resources across an explicit locus of hominin activity. Our results reveal that AGS was a seasonally waterlogged, largely unvegetated lakeside site situated near an ephemeral freshwater river surrounded by arid-adapted C4 grasses. The sparse vegetation at AGS contrasts with reconstructed (micro)habitats at the other anthropogenic sites at Olduvai Gorge, suggesting that central-provisioning places depended more heavily on water access than vegetation viz. woody plants as is often observed for modern hunter-gatherers. As hominins at AGS performed similar butchering activities as at other Bed I sites, our results suggest they did not need the shelter of trees and thus occupied a competitive position within the predatory guild.

In this paper, we studied the fish assemblages in 27 floodplain lakes, with perennial connection to the river, in the middle section of the Magdalena River (Colombia), to examine spatial pattern in freshwater fish diversity in relation to some environmental parameters. Our objective was to examine relationships between floodplain-lake fish communities and environmental variables associated with lake morphology, water chemistry and river-floodplain connectivity in a large river-floodplain ecosystem. During the study, a total of 18 237 fish were caught from 50 species (regional richness; 17 were migrants and 33 residents). In the present study, the most diverse order was Characiformes with 20 species, followed by Siluriformes, with 19 species. Characidae and Loricaridae were the richest families. The range of species richness (local richness) varied between five and 39 species. Similarity of local assemblages (using the presence-absence data) depends on the distance between lakes. A positive relationship was observed between the Ln of the total abundance of each species and the number of lakes where they were found. Out of all the environmental parameters taken in the lakes, only the size (Log Area) and relative perimeter length are significantly related to local assemblage species richness. It has not been possible to demonstrate that the connectivity (distance) from lakes to the main river can be considered a predictor of the local richness.					; Carvajal, Juan/K-8178-2014	Granado Lorencio, Carlos Antonio/0000-0002-3322-4276; Carvajal-Quintero, Juan David/0000-0001-6758-8118													0266-4674	1469-7831				MAY	2012	28		3				271	279		10.1017/S0266467412000181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467412000181													WOS:000302908400005
J	Ridgway, MS; Middel, TA; Pollard, JB				Ridgway, Mark S.; Middel, Trevor A.; Pollard, J. Bruce			Response of double-crested cormorants to a large-scale egg oiling experiment on Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We report on a management experiment examining the effects of large-scale egg oiling on double-crested cormorant nest abundance and measures of seasonal cormorant density (bird-days/km2) from 2000 to 2005. We employed the staircase design to distinguish transient responses to management treatments from site and year effects that generally contribute to variation in populations. The response to egg oiling in Georgian Bay was as expected with a decline in nest abundance attributable to egg oiling. In the North Channel, nest abundance did not decline because of egg oiling but increased, reflecting either retention of nesting adults or recruitment to colonies. This surprising outcome may stem from fish escapement from pen rearing facilities in the vicinity of the oiling experiment in the North Channel. We observed no effect of egg oiling on the JulyAugust seasonal density of cormorants. The strongest effect size was associated with site effects followed by year effects for nest abundance and seasonal density. The effect size of egg oiling on variation in nest abundance did not exceed 5% for any year in both the North Channel and Georgian Bay. Fish pen culture appears to affect coastal distribution of cormorants. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

J	Yagbasan, O; Yazicigil, H				Yagbasan, Ozlem; Yazicigil, Hasan			Assessing the impact of climate change on Mogan and Eymir Lakes' levels in Central Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Global warming is likely to have significant effect on the hydrological cycle. Some parts of the world may see significant reductions in precipitation or major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons. Climate change is one of the serious pressures facing water resources and their management over the next few years and decades. As part of the southern belt of Mediterranean Europe, Turkey is highly vulnerable to anticipated climate change impacts. The changes in global climate will seriously affect inland freshwater ecosystems and coastal lakes. Mogan and Eymir Lakes located in Central Turkey are shallow lakes that may be impacted significantly by climate change. The interaction between the lakes and groundwater system has been modelled in order to analyse the response of lake levels to climate change over a planning period of 96 years, beginning from October 2004 and ending in September 2100. The impacts of the emission scenarios of A2 and B1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on lake levels have been analyzed with the help of the lake-aquifer simulation model. The fluctuations in lake levels due to climate change scenarios are compared with the results of a scenario generated by the assumption of the continuation of the average recharge and discharge conditions observed for 1999 and 2004. The results show that very small, but long-term changes to precipitation and temperature have the potential to cause significant declines in lake levels and temporary drying of the lakes in the long-term. The impact of climate change on lake levels will depend on how these water resources are managed in the future.					, Hasan/AAT-2055-2021; Yağbasan, Özlem/AHB-6233-2022														1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2012	66	1					83	96		10.1007/s12665-011-1209-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1209-3													WOS:000302744100008
J	Tuvikene, L; Noges, T; Noges, P				Tuvikene, Lea; Noges, Tiina; Noges, Peeter			Why do phytoplankton species composition and "traditional" water quality parameters indicate different ecological status of a large shallow lake?	HYDROBIOLOGIA					2nd European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS)	AUG 10-14, 2009	Norrtaijle, SWEDEN					Long-term data on phytoplankton species composition in large and shallow Lake Vrtsjarv indicated a sharp deterioration of the ecological status at the end of the 1970s. The more traditional water quality indicators, such as the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass, and Secchi depth, failed to capture this tipping point or even showed an improvement of the status at that time. As the shift coincided with a large increase of the lake's water level (WL), we hypothesized that direct effect of the changing WL on traditional water quality indicators might have blurred the picture. We removed statistically the direct effect of the WL and the seasonality from the traditional water quality indicators in order to minimize the effects of natural variability. The average of the standardised water quality indicators, used as a proxy for the ecological status, distinguished a period of fast eutrophication in the first half of the 1970s (not captured by the phytoplankton species index), a fast improvement at the end of the 1970s (when the species index showed deterioration) followed by a continuous deterioration trend (when the species index remained rather constant). The causes of this inconsistency are discussed in the light of the alternative stable states theory and the priority of biotic indicators stipulated by the EU Water Framework Directive.

One objective of many field studies is to assess the predictability of bloom toxicity. Here we present data of a four-year monitoring of microcystins in lake Muggelsee together with data on spatial distribution and diversity of the predominant toxin-producer Microcystis sp. Microcystins were detectable in all seasons when Microcystis-biovolumes were detectable with seasonal maximum concentrations of 1-3 mug/L. In spatially resolved samples, the microcystin concentrations spanned more than an order of magnitude between up-wind and down-wind sites with highest concentrations at the latter ones. The bloom development of Microcystis and Aphanizomen was significantly correlated to the ratio of DIN: SRP and it is discussed whether this reflects a causal relationship or rather similar trends in both variables related to third one, like water temperature. The microcystin content of Microcystis was negatively correlated to Microcystis abundance, thus blooms were relatively less toxic during their peak. A metabolic typing of strains isolated from a single bloom sample revealed that the Microcystis bloom was composed of a multitude of toxin-producing and non-producing strains that differed in their production of microcystins and other non-ribosomal peptides. The number of distinguishable chemotypes clearly exceeded the number of microscopically determined morphotypes. Given the high clonal diversity of the Microcystis community we argue that a quantitative prediction of bloom toxicity is not possible without a better understanding of the molecular ecology of Microcystis and that an avoidance of toxic blooms of Microcystis is best to be done by appropriate restoration measures.

In this study - clastic light and dark laminae from lava-dammed Paleolake Alf in the Late Pleistocene in the Quaternary West Eifel Volcanic Field are analyzed to clarify how they formed and if they are of annual origin and comparable to assumed periglacial varves from neighboring Lake Holzmaar. Therefore, a multiproxy approach is applied combining sediment thin section analysis which focuses on composition and structure with C-14 dates. The results are compared to recently-formed annually-laminated clastic sediments of, e.g., the High Canadian Arctic. Observed sedimentation structures reveal sediment delivery by over- and interflows and deposition from suspension forming two characteristic microfacies: Type I graded laminae and Type II laminae with graded sublayers. Additionally, erosional bases and event deposits indicate episodic underflows. Thus, lamination is potentially seasonal but is significantly veiled by extreme runoff causing erosion and resuspension processes or a mixed water body preventing sediment delivery into the lake basin. However, sedimentation processes between watershed and lake could be reconstructed by comparing recent and paleosediment structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biogeochemical Stratification and Carbonate Dissolution-Precipitation in Hypersaline Microbial Mats (Salt Pond, San Salvador, The Bahamas)	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Microbial mat communities host complex biogeochemical processes and play a role in the formation of most carbonate rocks by influencing both carbonate precipitation and dissolution. In this study, the biogeochemistry of microbial mats from the hypersaline Salt Pond, San Salvador, Bahamas are described using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, microelectrode profiling, fatty acid methyl esters, and carbon and nitrogen analyses. These microbial mats are distinctly layered both chemically and with regard to composition of microbial community, where significant (rho < 0.05) differences are noted between layers and cores. Furthermore, an oxic upper zone and an H(2)S-rich lower zone dominate the Salt Pond microbial mats, where H(2)S concentrations were measured approaching 8 mM. The high H(2)S concentrations along with the lacking evidence of mineral precipitation in SEM images point to the prevalence of carbonate dissolution. Moreover, the high concentrations of organics (3-9%) reveal that the mats are self-sourcing and can provide ample fuel to sustain the highly active heterotrophic (both aerobic and anaerobic) metabolism. Seasonal differences in sulfide and oxygen concentrations in Salt Pond mats indicate that the carbonate dissolution and precipitation reactions are dynamic in this hypersaline lake.

Dynamics of natural populations of the dertitivorous mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray) (Hydrobiidae) in two interconnected Lakes differing in trophic state	SPRINGERPLUS												Here we investigate the allocation of resources between growth and reproduction by surveying the dynamics of natural populations of the aquatic detritivorous mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum from two interconnected lakes that differ in trophic state. The size distributions and reproductive output of the snail populations was analyzed monthly by field surveys spanning 3 years, and in a controlled microcosm experiment to evaluate the reproductive potential under laboratory conditions. Snails in the meso-oligotrophic lake showed reduced growth and a smaller size compared to snails in the eutrophic lake. However, the numbers of eggs and nearly-neonates per adult snail did not differ significantly between the two populations. It is speculated that P. antipodarum populations living under meso-oligotrophic conditions may consistently invest more internal energy in reproduction at the expense of growth and that food quantity may be an important driver for macro-invertebrate resource allocation in detrital food webs.					; Hunting, Ellard/B-3177-2010	Hunting, Ellard/0000-0002-8794-3452; 													2193-1801					DEC 15	2014	3								736	10.1186/2193-1801-3-736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-3-736								25674467					WOS:000359123000003

To describe the variabilities in water quality due to the climate, seasonalities and sub-daily fluctuations, such a model should be able to generate long-time output series on a sub-daily basis. This is established by extending the existing program codes of SWAT. While SWAT enables long-time simulations of agricultural pollution on a daily time step, ESWAT uses a time step of a user-defined fraction of an hour and an hourly time step to calculate the rainfall/runoff and the in-stream river routing processes, respectively. The hydrology part was further improved by including a convolution module and modifications of the evapotranspiration module of SWAT. A new module based on the QUALM concept was included to simulate the in-stream water quality processes. Also, an autocalibration module has been incorporated for the optimization of the process parameters. The method is based on a new approach for multi-objective calibration and incorporates the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) alogrithm. The optimization uses a global optimization criterion, whereby several output variables can be taken into account simultaneously. A new statistical method enables the aggregation of the objective functions for individual variables, hereby avoiding the weighting problem. ESWAT is applied on the Dender basin and the Wister Lake basin in Oklahoma, USA. These basins have different characteristics regarding pollution sources, hydrometeorology and scale, and thus provide a wide evaluation of the performance of ESWAT.

Seasonality of energy sources of Colossoma macropomum in a floodplain lake in the Amazon -: lake Camaleao, Amazonas, Brazil	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Stomach content and stable isotopes of tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum (Cuvier), were use to determine seasonality of energy sources in a floodplain lake in the central Amazon. The turnover time of carbon in young tambaqui was fast enough to detect a broad seasonal variation both in stomach content and tissue isotopic signal of carbon and nitrogen. The relative importance of food items varied with water level. C-3 plants (seeds and fruits) contributed between 55% and 95% of the biomass fraction of tambaqui. Zooplankton contributed a minimum of 26% of the nitrogen fraction during periods of flooding, and a maximum of 67% in the dry season. C-4 plants (macrophyte leaves and roots) contributed a maximum of 26% of the biomass fraction and 13% of the N fraction mainly during the flooding period.

Phytoplankton dynamics and hypoxia in Lake Erie: A hypothesis concerning benthic-pelagic coupling in the central basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent changes in the Lake Erie ecosystem suggest that reductions in phosphorus loads and invasion by dreissenid mussels, have enhanced light penetration, and altered phytoplankton distribution patterns in the lake. In this paper, we evaluate possible links between phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Erie, and seasonal development of hypoxia in the central basin by studying seasonal pattern of the vertical distribution of algae. On four occasions in 2002, the biomass of major algal assemblages was measured (epilimnion, metalimnion, hypolimnion, and benthos) at six sites in the central basin (n = 96). Pelagic chlorophyll concentrations in the central basin varied by several fold among the six sampling sites and three dates (range, 0.80 to 5.99 mg/m(3)). The greatest values were measured in the metalimnion. Benthic chlorophyll concentrations in the central basin were large. Values were highest in June and decreased dramatically thereafter. Mean (+/- SD) concentrations for the benthic assemblages at two stations were 31.1 +/- 18.9 mg/m(2), compared with values of 43.2 +/- 9.2 mg/m(2) for the pelagic assemblage at the same two stations. The consistent presence of a benthic algal assemblage in the central basin, whose species make-up was dominated by planktonic diatoms, suggests that the benthic assemblage in the central basin is more aptly viewed as a meroplanktonic algal maximum (MAM); an algal assemblage that spends part of its life history associated with both the pelagic and benthic environments. On a unit area basis, this MAM layer supported biomass comparable to that for the entire water column, suggesting that the MAM figures prominently into the development of hypoxia.

On the Seasonal Changes in the Surface Water Chemistry of Museum Lake, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India	POLLUTION												The surface water chemistry of Thiruvananthapuram Museum Lake was carried out in the period of February 2013 to January 2014. Correlation study of the parameters and overall CCME WQI (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water quality Index) was also prepared in the study for the lake water. The parameters analysed are cations such as Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+ and K+ and the anions like PO4-, Si-4(-), NO3- and NO2-. Abiotic factors like water pH, Temperature, Conductivity, TDS, Total Alkalinity and Total Hardness were also analysed. The pH ranged between 6.5 to 7.4. The total hardness ranged between 50.8-99 mg/L which shows the water is moderately hard one. During the pre monsoon period, water temperature showed a positive correlation with total alkalinity (r=0.915) pH (r=0.841) and TDS (0.876). Dissolved Oxygen (DO) value showed a positive correlation with Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) (r=0.999). The overall CCME water quality index was 80.81 which indicate the water body is protected with only a minor degree of threats. The quality of the water is an essential element of the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo environment with respect to both healths of the ecosystem and zoo tourism enjoyment. Moreover, if maintained properly, this water body can be treated as a major drinking water source for the zoo animals.

These two ecosystems have relatively similar areas, edaphic and environmental properties but are subjected to different levels of fishing exploitation (low at Manantali, high at Selingue). The comparison is based on two indicator parameters: the abundance indices and the size spectra distributions, obtained by the three methods at two contrasting hydrological seasons (April and October). The results were compared first between the two seasons, and then between the two lakes. The present work is based on two main hypotheses: (1) that there is a higher fish abundance in October associated with smaller overall sizes, after spawning; (2) a lower abundance and smaller sizes in the Selingue reservoir than in Manantali, because of the much higher fishing pressure in Selingue. The relevance of each method to the selected indicators is discussed. On the one hand, the three methodologies on the whole gave similar conclusions and they also complement each other. On the other hand, some results do not match the hypotheses because of biases due to difficulties and technical limitations of each method in such ecosystems (shallow water with vegetation and stumps of former forests).

This paleolimnological study was initiated to detect if the occurrence of sulphur bacteria was related to cultural eutrophication or reflected natural conditions. Therefore, diatoms, algal pigments, okenone, geochemical proxies, and Pb-210 and Cs-137 were used in four sediment cores to investigate historical changes in trophic development, hypolimnetic redox conditions, anoxia and phototrophic sulphur bacteria abundances. Fossil diatoms, pigments, the ratio of chlorophyll derivatives to total carotenoids and the ratio of chlorophyll a to its derivatives suggest two phases of eutrophication coupled with hypolimnetic anoxia over the last similar to 80 years: a first phase from about 1923-1932 and a second from 1952 to 1982. In the first phase the ratios of Fe-Mn as well as Fe-Ca increased, suggesting seasonal anoxia. However, hypolimnetic anoxia was only weak because low levels of okenone suggest no mass development of sulphur bacteria. In contrast, sulphur bacteria increased during the early stages of the second eutrophication phase, suggesting increased temporal and spatial hypolimnetic anoxia. Surprisingly, the ratios of Fe-Mn as well as Fe-Ca decreased during this time. Possibly Fe, Mn and Ca were equally reduced through the intense anoxia. In the final stage, sulphur bacteria decreased again. As these bacteria need both anoxic conditions and a certain amount of light, the increased nutrient load probably led to low Secchi depth and therefore insufficient light conditions. In more recent years, diatoms and pigments suggest a decrease in nutrient levels. A second mass development of sulphur bacteria occurred, probably due to improved light conditions and continued anoxia in the upper hypolimnion. We conclude that the recent development of phototrophic sulphur bacteria do not represent natural conditions in Lake Dudinghausen. Furthermore, the upper sediments contain a completely new diatom flora that never occurred in older sediments of Lake Dudinghausen. Therefore, nutrient levels may eventually reach natural conditions, however they may not represent biological background reference conditions.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2007	37	2					205	219		10.1007/s10933-006-9013-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9013-x													WOS:000243617400003

Effect of fire and thinning on fine-scale genetic structure and gene flow in fire-suppressed populations of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Historically, frequent, low-severity fires in dry western North American forests were a major driver of ecological patterns and processes, creating resilient ecosystems dominated by widely-spaced pine species. However, a century of fire-suppression has caused overcrowding, altering forest composition to shade-tolerant species, while increasing competition and leaving trees stressed and susceptible to pathogens, insects, and high-severity fire. Exacerbating the issue, fire incidence is expected to increase with changing climate, while fire season has been observed to begin earlier and last longer than historic trends. Forest thinning and prescribed fire have been identified as important management tools to mitigate these risks. Yet little is known of how thinning, fire, or their interaction affect contemporary evolutionary processes of constituent pine species that influence fitness and play an important role in the opportunity for selection and population persistence. We assessed the impact of widely used fuel reduction treatments on fine-scale gene flow on an ecologically important and historically dominant shade-intolerant pine species of the Sierra Nevada, Pinus lambertiana Dougl. Treatment prescription (no-thin-no-fire, thin-no-fire, and fire-and-thin) was found to differentially affect both fine-scale spatial and genetic structure as well as effective gene flow in this species. Specifically, the thin-no-fire prescription increases genetic structure (spatial autocorrelation of relatives) between adults and seedlings, while seed and pollen dispersal increase and decrease, respectively, as a function of increasing disturbance intensity. While these results may be specific to the stands at our study site, they indicate how assumptions relating to genetic effects based on spatial structure can be misleading (for instance, in many stands the presence or absence of spatial structure was not indicative the presence or absence of genetic structure). It is likely that these disequilibrated systems will continue to evolve on unknown evolutionary trajectories. The long-term impacts of management practices on reduced fitness from inbreeding depression should be continually monitored to ensure resilience to increasingly frequent and severe fire, drought, and pest stresses.					; North, Malcolm/AAW-8897-2020; Eckert, Andrew/E-4788-2011	North, Malcolm/0000-0002-9090-784X; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				SEP 1	2019	447						115	129		10.1016/j.foreco.2019.04.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.04.033													WOS:000474329400012

We tested this hypothesis in four types of experiments with juvenile rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) foraging on Daphnia longispina in an indoor twin column tank system. In each experiment of the first three types, one column contained one of three types of experimental treatments differing from the control treatment (in the other column) by the following: (i) elevated temperature in the epilimnion, (ii) hypoxia in the metalimnion and (iii) simultaneous elevated temperature in the epilimnion and hypoxia in the metalimnion. In the fourth type of experiment, the gradients of temperature and oxygen concentration in both columns were the same, but prior to the experiments, Daphnia and fish in the control treatment were acclimated to normoxia and, in the experimental treatment, to hypoxia. The results confirmed our hypothesis, since the predation rate of fish was greater in each of the first three experimental treatments than in the control. We did not detect an effect of the acclimation to hypoxia on the predation rate of the fish.

Based on statistical analyses of the data collected by measuring nineteen physicochemical variables, and applying an index, the comprehensive pollution index, to those data, the quality of the waters of Lake Dayat Roumi, Morocco, were assessed. Waters of the lake are currently characterized by a salinity of 921.7 mg Cl-/L and 124.2 mg sulfates/L. The concentration of chloride exceeds the value indicated in the standard norms. This can affect the composition of the sediment, overlying water, and specific composition of biota in the lake. Status and trends of values of other parameters also indicate deterioration of water quality in this lake. Multivariate statistical analysis made it possible to differentiate four clusters of samples according to their physicochemical characteristics. These groups are due to inputs from three sources of materials: leaching of rocks from the watershed and plantations, discharge of domestic wastewater and runoff water. Samples taken from deeper parts of the lake indicate a depression of concentrations of dissolved oxygen during the hot season. The analysis results demonstrate the heterogeneous degradation of the water quality in the peripheral areas and deep parts of the lake, favored by the leaching of soils by rainwater, which, when sufficiently severe, can cause repeated mortalities of fishes. This situation requires regular water quality monitoring to develop a management plan for restoration of water quality in the lake to preserve valued ecological services.					salamatullah, Ahmad/AAM-1108-2020; Ali, Gomaa/I-5067-2013; Aboul-Soud, Mourad/F-8111-2010; Giesy, John/MXJ-7032-2025	Aboul-Soud, Mourad/0000-0001-9395-0563; Ali, Gomaa/0000-0002-7152-531X; Giesy, John/0000-0003-1931-9962; lahcen, ouahmane/0000-0002-7378-549X; , Ahmad/0000-0003-1685-1400; bourhia, mohammed/0000-0003-3707-8461; Rezouki, Sanae/0000-0003-2748-6680														2071-1050				JUN	2022	14	11							6689	10.3390/su14116689	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116689													WOS:000810228200001
J	Kirk, K; Dusek, G; Tissot, P; Sweet, W				Kirk, Katie; Dusek, Gregory; Tissot, Philippe; Sweet, William			An Approach to Approximate Wave Height from Acoustic Tide Gauges	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The demand for nearshore wave observations is increasing due to spatial gaps and the importance of observations for accurate models and better understanding of inundation processes. Here, we show how water level (WL) standard deviation (sigma, sigma) measurements at three acoustic NOAA tide gauges that utilize an Aquatrak sensor [Duck, North Carolina, Bob Hall Pier (BHP) in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Lake Worth, Florida] can be used as a proxy for significant wave height (H-m0). Sigma-derived H-m0 is calibrated to best fit nearby wave observations and error is quantified through RMSE, normalized RMSE (NRMSE), bias, and a scatter index. At Duck and Lake Worth, a quadratic fit of sigma to nearby wave observations results in a R-2 of 0.97 and 0.83, RMSE of 0.11 and 0.11 m, and NRMSE of 0.09 and 0.22, respectively. A linear fit between BHP sigma and H-m0 is best, resulting in R-2 0.62, RMSE of 0.22, and NRMSE of 0.26. Regression fits deviate across NOAA stations and from the classic relationship of H-m0 = 4 sigma, indicating H-m0 cannot be accurately estimated with this approach at these Aquatrak sites. The dynamic water level (DWL = still WL & PLUSMN; 2 sigma) is calculated over the historic time series showing climatological and seasonal trends in the stations' daily maximums. The historical DWL and sigma wave proxy could be calculated for many NOAA tide gauges dating back to 1996. These historical wave observations can be used to fill observational spatial gaps, validate models, and improve understanding of wave climates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There is a large spatial gap in nearshore real-time observational wave data that can provide critical information to researchers and resource managers regarding inundation and erosion, help validate coastal hydrodynamic models, and provide the maritime community with products that help ensure navigational safety. This study utilizes existing infrastructure to help fill the demand for nearshore wave observations by deriving a proxy for wave height at three sites. This work shows spatial variability in the regression fits across the sites, which should be explored at more stations in future work. Multidecadal length time series were also used at the sites to investigate climatological and seasonal trends that provide insight into wave climates and wave driven processes important for coastal flooding.

Application to the Bolivian Altiplano	HYDROLOGY												As many other regions worldwide, the Bolivian Altiplano has to cope with water scarcity during dry periods, which in turn impacts on crop production as flood irrigation is overwhelmingly extended in the region. Since farming is the main income in the Altiplano for most families, the availability of greenhouses with water harvesting systems may represent a solution to warrant all year round production and food access. We study the daily satisfied water demand from a balance between rainfall collected by a greenhouse roof and water used for indoor crop irrigation assuming a tank is available for water storage. This balance is analyzed for 25 greenhouses spread over Batallas Municipality, close to Titicaca Lake, Bolivia, and for two case studies: (i) using irrigation data collected from farmers in the frame of a regional project; (ii) using theoretical daily water requirements assuming an intense greenhouse farming. Our evaluation includes a sensitivity analysis of relevant parameters, such as the influence of the time window of rainfall used in the simulation, the runoff coefficient, the roof surface area, the irrigation drip system, the irrigation frequency, the crop coefficient, the volume of water used for crop irrigation, and the capacity of the water tank. Overall, we find that the runoff coefficient has little impact on the satisfied demand rate, while all other parameters can play an important role depending on the greenhouse considered. Some greenhouses are able to irrigate crops normally during the wet season, while during the dry season, greenhouses are not able to satisfy more than 50% of the theoretical water requirements, even when large tanks are considered. Based on these results, we recommend the construction of greenhouses with a ground surface of <50 m(2) attached to the largest available covered water tank. The information here provided can be used by stakeholders to decide their policies of investment in infrastructures in the Altiplano. Finally, the approach we follow can be applied to any other region where rainfall, temperature, and greenhouse data are available.					Vigo Aguiar, M.

Sylhet Basin in Bangladesh subsides relatively rapidly and presents a topographically favorable channel course for the Brahmaputra River. Holocene occupations of this region remained routed along the basin's western margin, depositing tens of meters of amalgamated channel sands but leaving the central basin under-filled. The localized backwater effect from a seasonal lake that forms in Sylhet Basin, referred to as a "hydraulic barrier," has been proposed as a mechanism for keeping the channel pinned to the western margin. Using a 1-D channel profile model and a 2-D depth-averaged hydrodynamic model, we test the preferred flow path between two possible channel courses under a range of physical conditions. Results show that the hydraulic barrier interpretation is implausible unless water depths are increased beyond the physical dimensions of Sylhet Basin. Reducing topographic slope along the two pathways does not sufficiently enhance the local backwater to steer the channel to the basin center. Only the introduction of a scoured antecedent channel along the western margin induces a strong preference for bypass of the central basin. These results corroborate field evidence that Holocene outburst floods scoured a paleochannel that became the preferred course for the Brahmaputra within Sylhet Basin in the mid to late Holocene. We conclude that modification of basin topography by large, infrequent flood events can exert a persistent influence on channel steering that is comparable to previously documented effects of monsoon variability and tectonic deformation.

From this sequence, which is Karpatian in age, a teleost fish fauna (otoliths, teeth) is described that consists of 15 species, including Cypriniclae, Mugilidae, Atherinidae, Cyprinodontidae, Gobiidae, and Channidae. In addition. charophytes, vascular plant remains, bivalves, gastropods, ostracods, amphibia, reptilia, and mammals are recorded. Palacoccological analyses indicate that the fishes lived in a large, oligohaline, warm, and oligo- to mesotrophic lake with a water depth of five metres or more. Sedimentation rate estimates suggest that the lake existed for approximately 18.000 to 20.000 years. A remarkable enrichment of otoliths and teeth in the uppermost part of the lacustrine sequence is indicative of increased fish mortality, due perhaps to decreasing water-levels and seasonal occurrences of anoxic conditions. The persistence of a large lake in the Molasse Basin of central Switzerland during the Karpatiah was certainly favoured by low sedimentation rates during this period of time.

J	Arzayus, KM; Dickhut, RM; Canuel, EA				Arzayus, KM; Dickhut, RM; Canuel, EA			Fate of atmospherically deposited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Chesapeake Bay	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Factors controlling polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) distributions in southern Chesapeake Bay surface sediments were investigated with samples collected seasonally from five sites. Principal components analysis (PCA) suggests unique sources (combustion vs petroleum) and partitioning differences (volatile vs particle reactive) among PAHs, but a common mode of entry for these contaminants to Chesapeake Bay sediments. The fractional concentrations of all PAHs in Bay sediments, with the exception of perylene, were positively correlated with their atmospheric dry deposition fluxes (F(dry)) to the Bay indicating that atmospheric deposition of aerosol-bound PAHs to the watershed controls their influx to Bay sediments. Overall, PAH concentrations in Chesapeake Bay sediments were well explained by a multiple-regression model (r(2) = 0.88, p = 0.0001) with F(dry) and sediment total organic carbon (TOC) content explaining most of the variance (57% and 43%, respectively). However, for many PAHs gas. exchange across the air-water interface is of similar or greater magnitude even when Fdry is scaled to the watershed surface area. The fate of PAHs input to the Bay from gas deposition was determined to he uptake and metabolism within the aquatic food web rather than deposition to sediments.																			0013-936X					JUN 1	2001	35	11					2178	2183		10.1021/es001672s	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es001672s								11414016					WOS:000169052800026

Based on the types of waterbodies, concentrations of inorganic N of different forms, concentrations of PO(4)(3-), delta (15)NH(4) values in river and lake waterbodies, the pollution sources of N in the river, lake and well waters are distinguished, and comparisons are made of trend of variation and amplitude of concentration between years, seasons and N pollutants in waterbodies. The increase in N(2)O concentration in different waterbodies and high delta (15)NO(3)(-) value in different waterbodies are deemed as an evidence of the existence of denitrification in the river, lake and well waters. Moreover, the role of denitrification in the waterbodies plays in stabilizing chronically concentration of N as pollutant in the waterbodies and mitigating N load in the waterbodies.																			1006-9291					JUN	2001	44	3					304	314		10.1007/BF02879621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02879621													WOS:000169765500009

Separating genetic and environmental influences on temporal spawning distributions of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental and genetic factors influence fish spawning periodicity (i.e., the distribution of spawning events during the breeding season), but their relative contributions have rarely been evaluated. We evaluated the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on spawning periodicity by rearing Florida largemouth bass (FLMB, Micropterus salmoides floridanus) from Lake Okeechobee and intergrade largemouth bass (ILMB, Micropterus salmoides salmoides x M. s. floridanus) from Lake Seminole in a similar environment. Fish from each genetic source population were translocated to experimental ponds at an intermediate latitude in Gainesville, Florida, in September 2003. We used estimated ages of offspring as an index of spawning events to compare spawning distributions between brood sources in ponds and related those results to spawning distributions at source populations for 2004. FLMB began spawning earlier than ILMB in all ponds, and FLMB had a longer spawning season than ILMB. Similarly, FLMB at Lake Okeechobee began spawning earlier and had a longer spawning season than ILMB at Lake Seminole. Environmental factors (e.g., temperature effects) influenced spawning periodicity for both FLMB and ILMB, but spawning periodicity was also influenced by genetic composition in ponds because translocated fish reflected characteristics of their source populations. Thus, both environmental factors and genetic composition influenced spawning periodicity.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2006	63	11					2391	2399		10.1139/F06-122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-122													WOS:000241965000001

Consistent with the P-limitation hypothesis, declines in egg production and population density coincided with seasonal increases in the seston C:P ratio from 300 to 400-500 (molar) in all three lakes. Adult Daphnia collected from Lake Breukeleveen exhibited a linear increase in specific P content during the first 36 h of feeding on a P-rich diet in the laboratory (r(2) = 0.99), which confirms that field Daphnia experienced P deficits in their tissues. Laboratory experiments tested the growth of juvenile D. cucullata in controls with natural seston and in seston supplemented with phosphate or the P-rich cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Growth was also estimated in filtered lake water with Scenedesmus (2 mg C L-1) as food. This design allowed us to partition differences between the control and Scenedesmus growth rates into limitation by phosphorus, energy and residual factors. In each of 10 experiments, D. cucullata exhibited improved growth in response to the phosphate and Synechococcus supplements. In agreement with predictions, Daphnia exhibited the lowest control growth rate and the strongest response to P addition in seston from the lake with the highest seston C:P ratio. However, animals in seston from two lakes with very similar seston C:P ratios differed in their growth responses. Our results confirm dietary P limitation but show that energy limitation and residual factors also contributed to between-lake differences in Daphnia growth.

The analysis of the sex ratio showed a higher proportion of males than that of females, The average size of the eggs was 6.12 (+/- 0.55) mm(3) in the non-eyed stage (stage A) and 7.20(+/- 0.86)mm(3) in the eyed stage (stage B). The reproductive output (RO) calculated with the dried-body weight of an incubating female and the weight of the eggs in dried condition was 26.97% (n = 17) of the average females weight. Incubating prawn appeared in April, and the gonadosomatic indices (GSI) showed the highest value during three months from January to March. Based on the month when there was a high proportion of incubating females with a high GSI, the estimated spawning season of P paucidens was April, The maturity of the female was evaluated by the development of the ovaries and the existence of eggs, The average body length when 50% of the females in the group reached maturity was 8.55 (+/- 2.74) mm. The analysis of the length-frequency distribution showed that the life span of P. paucidens ranged from 12 to 13 months. Females mature faster than males.

J	Lycariao, TA; Dantas, EW				Alves Lycariao, Thaina; Wocyli Dantas, Enio			Interactions between different biological forms of aquatic macrophytes in a eutrophic tropical reservoir in Northeastern Brazil	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The aquatic plants and biological processes have different interactions and their knowledge may contribute to the understanding of environmental dynamics in wetlands. The aim of this study was to report the type of interactions that different biological forms of macrophytes stand in the eutrophic tropical reservoir of Penha reservoir, Northeastern Brazil. Data collection was captured every two months from October 2009 to October 2010, considering the hydrological cycle in one-year period. For this, twelve perpendicular transects (separated by 10 m) at the reservoir's water edge were defined; each transect had two plots of 625 cm(2) (25 x 25 cm, separated by one meter) from which samples were obtained. Plants were collected and transported in identified plastic bags for subsequent quantification of the dry weight biomass; additionally, pressed samples were made in the field for identification purposes. The relative interaction index (RII) was used to identify the existence of positive and/or negative interactions between the biomass of the biological forms of aquatic plants. Student's t-tests were used to analyze variations in the abiotic data and biomass over time, and to determine differences between the dry and rainy seasons. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between the biological forms and the biomass of the macrophytes, as well as environmental variables and RII. In the dry season, the environment was mainly composed of floating macrophytes (1 013.98 g/m(2)), with mats of submerged macrophytes (98.18 g/m(2)) that demonstrated a range of positive (RII= 1.0) to negative (RII= -0.2) interactions. The biomass of emergent macrophytes increased throughout the dry season (4.87 to 106.91 g/m(2)) due to the nurse plant effect that served as a substratum (RII= 1.0). During the rainy season the biomass of submerged macrophytes was reduced by 97 % due to direct and indirect relationships (RII= -1.0) to other macrophytes. Rainfall and emergent plants contributed to a reduction in the biomass of floating macrophytes (19.16 g/m(2)). The emergence of a third group of plants (emergent) lead floating plants to occupy other areas and excluded submerged plants. Overall, the interactions among plants within ecosystems were not definite due to stand composition and seasonality.					; Dantas, Ênio/I-2011-2015	Lycariao, Thaina/0000-0002-5255-7367; 													0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2017	65	3					1095	1104		10.15517/rbt.v65i3.29441	http://dx.doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v65i3.29441													WOS:000412620100020

Estimating water balance components of tropical wetland lakes in the Pantanal dry season, Brazil	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Water balance studies with stable water isotopes have rarely been conducted in remote and tropical wetland areas. As such, little is known regarding the water balance and groundwater-surface water interaction in the Pantanal, one of the largest and most pristine wetlands in the world. We applied MINA TreS, a water balance model utilizing stable water isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) and chloride (Cl-) to assess the dry-season hydrological processes controlling groundwater-surface water interactions and the water balance of six floodplain lakes in the northern Pantanal, Brazil. Qualitatively, all lakes exhibited similarity in hydrological controls. Quantitatively, they differed significantly due to morphological differences in controlling groundwater inflow and lake volume. Our approach is readily transferable to other remote and tropical wetland systems with minimal data input requirements, which is useful in regions with sparse hydrometric monitoring.

Sound production of spawning lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) in the Lake Winnebago watershed, Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				The primary goal of this study was to obtain accurate data of previously undocumented lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) spawning sounds, generated during wild sturgeon reproduction. Biologists have long known that lake sturgeon produce low-frequency sounds during spawning bouts; energy from these sounds can break the surface of the water occasionally and propagate harmonics in the terrestrial atmosphere, creating a faint drumming popularly known as sturgeon thunder'. Understanding the contribution of this sonic behavior in context is essential for gaining a more comprehensive scientific appreciation of the process of sturgeon spawning, and accurate acoustic data should prove useful for fisheries managers seeking to monitor or enhance sturgeon stocks for reproductive activity. Recordings were made at several locations on the Wolf and Embarrass rivers during the 2011-2013 spawning seasons. Drumming sounds ranging from 5 to 8Hz fundamental frequency were evident. Other characteristic noises associated with spawning lake sturgeon, including low-frequency rumbles and hydrodynamic sounds, were identified. Other high frequency sounds were also discovered. All of these sounds coalesce into a distinctive acoustic signature of lake sturgeon spawning activity. Knowledge of this sonic signature can be used to accurately document reproductive activity at multiple locations over extended periods using remote recording tools and techniques.

Net Snowpack Accumulation and Ablation Characteristics in the Inland Temperate Rainforest of the Upper Fraser River Basin, Canada	HYDROLOGY												This study examines the net snow accumulation and ablation characteristics and trends in the Inland Temperate Rainforest (ITR) of the Upper Fraser River Basin, British Columbia (BC), Canada. It intends to establish whether elevation and/or air temperature play(s) a dominant role in hydrological year peak snow water equivalent (SWE) and whether regional patterns emerge in the interannual variability in peak accumulation. To that end, SWE and air temperature data from seven snow pillow sites in the Upper Fraser River Basin at elevations ranging from 1118 to 1847 m above sea level are analyzed to infer snowpack characteristics and trends for hydrological years 1969-2012, with 2005-2012 being the actual period of data overlap. Average peak SWE ranges from 391.3 mm at Barkerville, BC on 16 April to 924.4 mm at Hedrick Lake, BC on 27 April. Snow cover duration lasts 206-258 days, with snow onset dates from mid-October to early November and snow off dates from late May to early July. Statistically-significant (p = 0.05) cross correlations exist between peak SWE at nearly all sites, indicating regional coherence in seasonal synoptic activity across the study area. However, the lack of relationships between peak SWE and elevation as well as air temperature parameters indicate that mesoscale to local processes lead to distinct snow accumulation and ablation patterns at each site. Four sites with the longest records exhibit no trend in peak SWE values between 1990 and 2012. Changes to snowpack regimes may pose a threat to the productivity and immense biodiversity supported by the ancient western red cedar and hemlock stands growing in the wet toe slopes of the ITR. Thus, it is imperative that continued monitoring of snowpack conditions remains a top priority in the Upper Fraser River Basin, allowing for a better understanding of ecosystem changes in a warming climate.																				2306-5338				DEC	2014	1	1					1	19		10.3390/hydrology1010001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology1010001													WOS:000457910800001

The response to enrichment was assessed using chlorophyll a, photosynthesis, particulate stoichiometric ratios, PO4 turnover and N and P debt assays. The response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and iron (Fe) enrichments indicated that although N is the nutrient that becomes deficient most consistently, P deficiency is common as well. When Fe was added with N and P, the response by chlorophyll was four times the response to N and P without Fe. This suggests that, after N and P, Fe is the next most limiting nutrient in Lake Malawi. Light was a factor controlling phytoplankton growth in situ during the deep mixing season, and grazer removal experiments demonstrated that zooplankton > 50 mum are important in modifing the response of algae to light and nutrients. In Lake Victoria, experiments demonstrated that phytoplankton were primarily light-limited during the early-stratified season. Increased light levels resulted in N deficiency. Fe additions stimulated N uptake in both Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi and N-2 fixation in Lake Victoria.

A Case Study From the Dongting Lake Wetlands	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The distribution range of plants is usually related to their competitiveness. The competitive ability between common widespread, which are generally considered to be invasive, and common endemic species, is still not very clear. Five plant communities were monitored in the field to compare the competitive abilities of widespread species, Phragmites australis, and endemic species, Triarrhena lutarioriparia, in the Dongting Lake wetlands. The ratios of individual numbers of T. lutarioriparia to P. australis per square meter were found to be 9:0, 14:1, 10:5, 7:6, and 0:11 in the five respective communities. A manipulation experiment was then performed with five planting modes (T. lutarioriparia: P. australis was 4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4, respectively). Results from field monitoring showed that the two plant species exhibited similar decreased survival percentages during flooding. P. australis had higher aboveground biomass before the flooding and a higher relative elongation rate, whereas T. lutarioriparia had higher aboveground biomass after flooding and a higher relative growth rate (RGR). P. australis had a higher competitive ability than T. lutarioriparia before and after the flooding. The manipulation experiment revealed that P. australis had a higher survival percentage than T. lutarioriparia, with no differences in plant biomass, RGR, and the relative elongation rate between the two species. P. australis was found to have a higher competitive ability than T. lutarioriparia in the early growing stage and a lower competitive ability in the middle and later stages. The relative yield total in the field monitoring and manipulation experiment was 1, indicating that T. lutarioriparia and P. australis occupied different niches in the experimental conditions. It was concluded that, compared with T. lutarioriparia, P. australis has a higher competitive ability in submerged habitats and a lower competitive ability in the non-submerged habitat. The niche differences between the two species enabled their coexistence in the Dongting Lake wetlands with seasonal flooding.					; DU, YUHANG/AAJ-7745-2021	Peng, Zenghui/0009-0007-4510-8524; 													1664-462X					MAY 24	2022	13								864316	10.3389/fpls.2022.864316	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.864316								35685024					WOS:000807417600001

Variations in the species' abundance (in time and across several lakes) in relation to environmental variables were explored using statistical methods. In five shallow, nutrient-rich, Danish takes, the seasonal abundance of C. dubius was modelled using multiple linear regression techniques. Four significant variables (NO2 + NO3 and silica concentrations, Secchi depth and zooplankton abundance) explained 24% of the variation in the seasonal diatom data. The abundance of C. dubius was positively correlated with [NO2 + NO3] and negatively correlated with [SiO2], Secchi depth and zooplankton abundance. In a dataset of 29 surface-sediment samples from Danish lakes, significant species response curves could be modelled for C. dubius with lake depth, and concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), silica and chlorophyll a. Analyses of species data over different timescales demonstrate that multiple, interactive factors and dynamic processes influence the abundance of the diatom in the phytoplankton and in sediment assemblages.																			0967-0262					AUG	2003	38	3					265	276		10.1080/0967026031000136349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0967026031000136349													WOS:000185768100009

Evaluating the effect of wind-driven patchiness on trophic interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured spatial patterns of zooplankton and chlorophyll concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton) with continuous sensors along horizontal transects that were repeatedly sampled (n = 150) under varying wind conditions throughout a growing season in two basins (South Arm and Annie Bay) of Lake Opeongo, Ontario, Canada. Spatially explicit in situ simulations that included activity costs associated with feeding were used to examine the effects of chlorophyll patchiness on the energy gain in different zooplankton communities. Simulations were repeated for several zooplankton size classes (small, large, and bulk) and two communities (all copepods and all cladocerans). For each simulated combination, a spatial energetic differential (SED) was estimated by contrasting the energy that zooplankton could gain using observed spatial patterns in chlorophyll and water temperature with the energy they could gain using uniform concentrations of chlorophyll and water temperature. Large zooplankton showed the greatest SED range across all communities, from a decrease of 8% to a maximum increase of 20%, assuming relatively low costs associated with feeding activity. Small zooplankton had the narrowest SED range. Zooplankton energy gain is sensitive to both the degree of zooplankton-chlorophyll spatial overlap and energetic costs associated with zooplankton feeding activity. SED values as high as 485% can occur under plausible estimates of activity costs. Wind-driven increases in spatial overlap between predator and prey can be large enough to substantially alter planktonic trophic interactions.

The effect of submergence on seed germination in M. bimucronata was firstly studied. Patterns of water absorption by M. bimucronata seeds were investigated thereafter to assess the imbibition phases of scarified and unscarified seeds. The germination percentage was significantly higher in scarified than in unscarified seeds, and the velocity of seed germination also increased considerably in scarified seeds. Submergence duration did not significantly affect germination percentages of scarified and unscarified seeds. Therefore, seed viability after submersion suggests that M. bimucronata may display hydrochorous dispersal and also that seeds are able to germinate successfully in areas with frequent seasonal flooding. With respect to imbibition phases, phase II was very short or even absent for scarified and unscarified seeds; therefore, a plateau, where water absorption by seeds is established, was not observed. Finally, we verified that the passage from phase I to III was very tenuous and took a long time in seeds without scarification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The function of habitat change during brood-rearing in the precocial Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus	ACTA ETHOLOGICA												Food availability is often variable during the breeding season. Parents with nonmobile, altricial young have no choice but to accept changes in local food availability, whereas in precocial animals, the parents may lead their young away from poor sites to areas that have rich resources and/or are safe from predators. We investigated the latter hypotheses in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus, a precocial shorebird that raises its young in two habitats: on lakeshore and in saltmarsh. Parents move with their broods from saltmarsh to lakeshore, especially late in the breeding season, and we hypothesized that lakeshores provide more food than the saltmarsh. Consistent with our hypotheses, plover chicks grew faster on the shore, and the difference in growth rates between the two habitats was amplified later in the breeding season. In addition, brood survival was higher on lakeshore than in saltmarsh and decreased with hatching date. Taken together, our results suggest that Kentish plover parents increase their reproductive success by switching brood-rearing habitats strategically.					; Kosztolanyi, Andras/B-8008-2016; Szekely, Tamas/I-7089-2016	Cuthill, Innes/0000-0002-5007-8856; Kosztolanyi, Andras/0000-0002-9109-5871; Szekely, Tamas/0000-0003-2093-0056													0873-9749					NOV	2007	10	2					73	79		10.1007/s10211-007-0032-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10211-007-0032-z													WOS:000249441500004

Adult common carp in Lake Mead, Nevada. were collected from a contaminated site (Las Vegas Bay) that receives municipal and industrial effluent and from a reference site (Overton Arm) with a relatively low level of contamination. Fish were sampled seven times over a 1-year period extending over two separate spawning seasons. Morphometric and histopathological parameters of gonadal and germ cell development were determined. In males, the pattern of seasonal changes in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was similar between the sites and showed no clear association with site-specific seasonal temperature profiles. However, Las Vegas Bay males had consistently lower GSI values and, on one of the sampling dates, a lower proportion of sperm relative to other germ cell stages (determined histologically). Further, Las Vegas Bay males had a higher incidence of gonadal macrophage aggregates, which are putative tissue biomarkers of contaminant exposure in fishes. In females, seasonal GSI profiles, the frequency of fish with postovulatory follicles (an index of spawning activity), and the timing of new follicle recruitment all showed differences between sites, but these differences generally matched differences in water temperature profile. Also, the peak size-frequency of full-grown follicles did not differ between sites, and estimates of fecundity for the second spawning season indicated that females from the reference site unexpectedly produced a lower number of gametes. Overall, site differences in gonadal condition were observed in carp of both sexes but they seemed to be associated with site differences in contaminant levels only in males. The apparent lack of association between contaminant level and gonadal condition in female carp from mildly mesotrophic Lake Mead may indicate a lack of contaminant effects in females or a confounding effect of the higher nutrient loads in the Las Vegas Bay environment.

Morbidity and mortality of the Critically Endangered Lake Oku clawed frog Xenopus longipes	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Between 2006 and 2010, recurring morbidity and mortality of the endemic Lake Oku clawed frog Xenopus longipes was observed at its only known locality, Lake Oku, Cameroon. During repeated visits in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we found large numbers of dead frogs around the lake shore, as well as a higher than expected prevalence of diseased frogs. No significant relationships between disease occurrence and environmental parameters were found, with the exception of a significant but unexplained association between phosphate concentration and disease incidence. Tissue samples from X. longipes collected during 3 field seasons were negative for the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) using a Bd-specific real-time PCR test, although other species of sympatric amphibians were positive for this pathogen. Only 1 of 48 tissue samples from diseased frogs was positive for ranavirus infection using a ranavirus-specific PCR, suggesting that this pathogen is not necessarily the cause of this disease. No evidence of pathogens was found in tissues examined histologically from 10 X. longipes which had been collected and fixed when freshly dead. The cause(s) of the morbidities and mortalities remain(s) unknown, as does their consequence to the population of this Critically Endangered species. Identifying the causative factor(s) of the X. longipes mortality and its impact on the population is crucial for planning conservation actions.

A limnological study of the Merja Sidi Boughaba in 2009 has shown that there are many common features between the physico-chemical and biological conditions of this site and previous data reported from some of the wetlands of the Do ana National Park (South-West Spain). Both are Ramsar sites located on extensive dune systems of the Atlantic coast with a Mediterranean climate. They have a common palaeoenvironmental history that is largely responsible for their similar hydrology and water composition. Oceanic influence has probably produced a slight disproportion of Mg2+ over Ca2+ through airborne sea salt deposition and the surface evaporation of groundwater feeding these wetlands during annual flood and drought cycles. The wide spectrum of environmental conditions encountered in the Do ana wetlands is epitomised by the Merja Sidi Boughaba, where water and sediment gradually change in the same water body from north to south: from humic-coloured waters and a sandy substrate to a calcium-rich substrate with turbid and silted waters which eventually dry out. As a consequence, the community of submersed macrophytes is very rich and dominated by dense charophyte beds. The high primary production coupled with high biodiversity found in the Merja Sidi Boughaba is also shared by the Do ana wetlands. The high conservation status of both sites enables a useful comparison to be made of the water quality of shallow aquatic systems at a regional scale which, contrary to the trophic classifications developed for deep stratified lakes in temperate regions, is not based on regressions between the concentrations of chlorophyll and total phosphorus (Tot-P) but on the proportions of dissolved and particulate P pools. In these Mediterranean sites, nutrients are more efficiently recycled through the sediment (whether deposited at the bottom or suspended in the water column) while seasonal fluctuations of the water level are stronger than in deep stratified lakes and, hence, no significant correlation was found between chlorophyll and either total or particulate P in our study.

In a laboratory setting, using eggs collected in the field, we investigated the relationship between the date of hatching of five successive cohorts of this fish and certain spawning parameters of each cohort at adulthood. Depending on the cohort, adult females spawned on average 3,000-4,000 eggs apiece in 1.5-3.5 mean spawning events between early April (water temperature 10.5 degrees C) and mid-July (25.9 degrees C). Spawning occurred at intervals of 3 to 9 days in May and June in one cohort, but irregularly in the other cohorts. More than 80% of the eggs released were spawned early in the breeding season (at <20 degrees C water temperature) in the three earlier-hatched cohorts, but the two later-hatched cohorts spawned less than 70% of the eggs during the same period. These data show that G. caerulescens is a multiple spawner with spawning occurring intermittently several times during the spawning season; they also suggest that the date of hatching affects the spawning pattern at maturity.																			0021-5392					JAN	2013	79	1					31	37		10.2331/suisan.79.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.79.31													WOS:000316591300004

Among the four lakes, Lake Taihu and Chaohu are situated in the mid-lower Yangtze Plain near sea level, and Lake Dianchi and Xingyunhu are located on the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau. A total of 102 ciliate species, representing 15 orders and 66 genera, were studied. Ciliate communities in Lake Taihu and Chaohu were characterized by abundant algivorous and mixotrophic oligotrichs and prostomatids, while Lake Dianchi and Xingyunhu ciliate communities were primarily characterized by voracious bacterivorous scuticociliates and peritrichids. Cluster analysis based on the transformed square root of ciliate abundance showed that samples from Lake Taihu and Chaohu composed one group whereas samples from Lake Dianchi and Xingyunhu composed another group in each season. Our results indicated that all dominant ciliate species are ubiquitous and that species dominance is regulated by different factors in different subtropical eutrophic lakes.

Comparison of tropospheric NO2 vertical columns in an urban environment using satellite, multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy, and in situ measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities have been retrieved and compared for the first time in Toronto, Canada, using three methods of differing spatial scales. Remotely sensed NO2 vertical column densities, retrieved from multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy and satellite remote sensing, were evaluated by comparison with in situ vertical column densities estimated using a pair of chemiluminescence monitors situated 0.01 and 0.5 km a. g. l. (above ground level). The chemiluminescence measurements were corrected for the influence of NOz, which reduced the NO2 concentrations at 0.01 and 0.5 km by an average of 8+/-1% and 12+/-1 %, respectively. The average absolute decrease in the chemiluminescence NO2 measurement as a result of this correction was less than 1 ppb. The monthly averaged ratio of the NO2 concentration at 0.5 to 0.01 km varied seasonally, and exhibited a negative linear dependence on the monthly average temperature, with Pearson's R = 0.83. During the coldest month, February, this ratio was 0.52+/-0.04, while during the warmest month, July, this ratio was 0.34+/-0.04, illustrating that NO2 is not well mixed within 0.5 km above ground level. Good correlation was observed between the remotely sensed and in situ NO2 vertical column densities (Pearson's R value ranging from 0.72 to 0.81), but the in situ vertical column densities were 52 to 58% greater than the remotely sensed columns. These results indicate that NO2 horizontal heterogeneity strongly impacted the magnitude of the remotely sensed columns. The in situ columns reflected an urban environment with major traffic sources, while the remotely sensed NO2 vertical column densities were representative of the region, which included spatial heterogeneity introduced by residential neighbourhoods and Lake Ontario. Despite the difference in absolute values, the reasonable correlation between the vertical column densities determined by three distinct methods increased confidence in the validity of the values provided by each measurement technique.					; Evans, Greg/C-7441-2014	Evans, Greg/0000-0002-9641-4499; 													1867-1381	1867-8548					2013	6	10					2907	2924		10.5194/amt-6-2907-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-6-2907-2013													WOS:000326547100025

Interactions between Striped Bass and Other Game Fish in Reservoirs	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF INLAND STRIPED BASS AND HYBRID STRIPED BASS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Striper 2009: Inland Striped Bass and Hybrid Striped Bass Management / 139th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	AUG 31-SEP 02, 2009	Nashville, TN	Amer Fisheries Soc, So Div, Striped Bass Tech Comm, US Fish & Wildlife Serv, SE Reg, US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Panama City Field Off, US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Welaks Natl Fish Hatchery, Arkansas Game & Fish Commiss, S Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Texas Pk & Wildlife, Harry Hampton Mem Wildlife Fund, Duke Energy, Amer Fisheries Soc, Fisheries Management Sect, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Cent Div, Amer Fisheries Soc, Oklahoma Chapter, Santee Cooper Country, Striped Bass Conservat Coalit, Striper Kings, Amer Fisheries Soc, Tennessee Chapter, Amer Fisheries Soc, Texas Chapter, Midlands Striper Club, Amer Fisheries Soc, Arkansas Chapter, Jordan Lake Striper Club, Amer Fisheries Soc, S Carolina Chapter, Amer Fisheries Soc, Virginia Chapter, Appalachian Aquat				Competitive interactions among reservoir fishes may be pronounced because fish assemblages in these artificial environments have had little time to develop niche-partitioning strategies that alleviate negative interspecific interactions. Such interactions may at times have been intensified by introductions of predators such as striped bass Morone saxatilis, introduced to create additional fisheries and control pelagic clupeids. Possible interactions between existing fish assemblages and striped bass include predation and competition. While there is a perception among angler groups that predation by striped bass on coexisting game fish is significant, most studies have reported little or no predation on game fish by striped bass and have considered predation rare and inconsequential. Moreover, predation that occurs will likely be compensatory and fail to reduce overall game fish survival. Any indirect effect of striped bass predation by restricting prey-sized game fish to limited refuge sites remains unknown. Exploitative competition may be more common. Although infrequently, introduced striped bass have depleted prey resources shared with other piscivores, particularly when stocking rates have been high, when there is a high rate of natural reproduction, or when prey supply has plunged in response to environmental fluxes. Fluctuation in prey supply, associated with ordinary environmental variability, and associated time lags in prey supply and predator demand, preclude adjusting predator densities to exactly balance demand with supply. The frequency of low supply demand ratios varies across systems and exhibits seasonal trends. Nevertheless, chronic supply demand imbalances are manageable where the predator assemblage is at least partially controlled through stocking, harvest regulations, or both. Because of the poor state of knowledge concerning the parameters defining balance and because uncontrollable annual fluctuations preclude exact management of alternating prey levels, we suggest adjusting stocking to manage demand so that it equals the median historical prey supply. Simulating the removal of striped bass and predicting the aftermath may be the most cost-effective way to provide decision support for stakeholders involved in determining if a striped bass stocking program is beneficial to most users.

Lacustrine mudstones of the Msec Member were acquired from two shallow boreholes 80 km apart and were analysed for lamination structure and periodicity, mineral composition and dispersed organic matter, in order to obtain more detailed information on the palaeoenvironmental change with a near annual resolution. Two hydrological states of the lake were identified, including high lake-level periods with dysoxic conditions on the lake floor, under a permanently thermally stratified hypolimnion favouring organic matter production and storage during periods of condensed sedimentation producing an irregular lamination pattern. A series of continuous regular couplet lamination reflect conditions of partially, possibly seasonally stratified hypolimnion with advanced lake-water mixing and organic matter oxidation. The couplet lamination results from an alternation of organic-clay laminae, consisting of variable proportions of autochthonous algal and microbial organic remnants, with detrital silt laminae accompanied by authigenic siderite and humified or burnt terrestrial plant debris. Similarly as in some modern tropical lakes, such regular high-frequency variations in sediment supply suggest seasonal changes in rainfall to be responsible for couplet formation. Couplet thickness distribution shows statistically significant periodicities, resembling multiannual to multidecadal scales observed in recent sediment archives, and so indirectly supports seasonality in precipitation in Pangaean low-latitudes, at least during part of the Stephanian B.					; Laurin, Jiri/H-6396-2014; Matysová, Petra/M-8022-2015; Matys Grygar, Tomas/L-6014-2013; Laurin, Jiří/H-6396-2014	Matys Grygar, Tomas/0000-0003-0931-0390; Lojka, Richard/0000-0002-9719-2656; Laurin, Jiri/0000-0001-6674-1117; 													1214-1119						2010	85	4					709	734		10.3140/bull.geosci.1210	http://dx.doi.org/10.3140/bull.geosci.1210													WOS:000285651000014

It is known that they live attached to hard surfaces. They have never been linked with any animal, in particular not with Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel), which is known to have only endosymbionts. This study was conducted in March 2004 in Cingi-Lingi Lake. The lake is an oligo-mesotrophic man-made gravel pit in northeast Croatia. During this study, polyps were found singly or in colonies of two to five on willow twigs and on the shells of D. polymorpha collected from 8 m depth and on metal barrels. Brown hydra (Pelmatohydra oligactis) individuals were also present next to polyps of Craspedacusta on zebra mussel shells, collected from metal barrels.

J	Gray, CA; Kennelly, SJ				Gray, CA; Kennelly, SJ			Catch characteristics of the commercial beach-seine fisheries in two Australian barrier estuaries	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A scientific observer programme was used to estimate the retained and discarded catches taken in two of the largest commercial beach-seine fisheries (Lake Macquarie and St. Georges Basin) in New South Wales, Australia. Catches were sampled in each estuary in each of four seasons throughout 1998/1999 and the data were used to estimate the quantities and length compositions of species caught, retained and discarded in these fisheries and to assess potential interactions with other fisheries. A total of 118 catches were sampled which yielded 72 finfish and 10 invertebrate species. Multivariate analyses showed that the mix of species in catches varied between estuaries, with 70 species (41 of which were retained) captured in Lake Macquarie and 37 species (26 retained) in St. Georges Basin. Despite these differences, the predominant species taken and patterns of discarding were similar in the two fisheries. The sparids Rhabdosargus sarba, Acanthopagrus australis and the gerreid Gerres subfasciatus were three of the four most abundant species caught in each estuary, with 99, 88 and 34% of these species discarded, respectively. Compliance with minimum legal length (MLL) accounted for most discarding practices, but for those species with no MLL, discarding was generally market-driven and size-based. An estimated 65% by number and 57% by weight of the catch in Lake Macquarie, and 77% by number and 59% by weight of the catch in St. Georges Basin, was discarded. We estimated that a total of 468 t (269 t discarded) was caught in Lake Macquarie and 143 t (85 t discarded) was caught in St. Georges Basin throughout the I year survey. We discuss our findings in relation to interactions with other fisheries and future management strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The result of hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three distinct clusters corresponding to the pre-monsoon (35.42%), post-monsoon (52.08%), and monsoon (12.50%) seasons. The factor analysis yielded three principal components suggesting the sediment flux, farming discharge, domestic waste, bacterial oxidation of sulfur compounds, and dissolution of plant matters associated with dissolved feldspar minerals as the influential factors. The lake hydrochemistry also varied significantly, both spatially and temporally implying geogenic weathering processes from rock-soil-water interactions. Overall, sixteen aquatic macrophytes were identified, and their monthly and daily net primary productivity varied considerably in different seasons. Regression analysis highlighted the effect of temperature, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and turbidity on the seasonal fluctuations in macrophyte productivity. Overall, the study provides insights into seasonal variation in the lake water chemistry and highlights the role of statistical tools in understanding the fragile aquatic ecosystems over cost-, labor-, and time-intensive inventory studies.

This isolate had identical biochemical reactions. The 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA of bacterial colonies were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers (27F and 1492R). A phylogenetic analysis on the base of 16S rRNA gene sequences presented that novel Weissella sp. named Taj-Apis represented a different lineage near to the genus Weissella and showing only 90% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to their nearest neighbor or Weissella sp. PSMS4-4 and deposited in GenBank. Weissella species have been isolated from a diversity of sources and sonic of them play significant roles in fermentation. However, the sequences had remarkable differences. Hence, this is the first investigation appraising the use of 16S rRNA sequence analysis for identification of known and new species of honeycomb Weissella of giant honey bee Apis dorsota obtained from Malaysia. Our findings would serve as a basic and fundamental data and provide general knowledge about the characteristics of the microorganisms in honeycomb for their importance in human gastro-intestinal tract health.

Geophysical surveys have characterized the lake, its subglacial catchment, and the thickness, structure, and flow of the overlying ice sheet. Covering 28.9 km(2), Ellsworth Subglacial Lake is located below 2.9 to 3.3 km of ice at depths of -1361 to -1030 m. Seismic reflection data have shown the lake to be up to 156 m deep and underlain by unconsolidated sediments. Ice sheet flow over the lake is characterized by low velocities (<6 m yr(-1)) flow convergence, and longitudinal extension. The lake appears to be in steady state, although the hydrological balance may vary over glacial-interglacial cycles. Direct access, measurement, and sampling of Ellsworth Subglacial Lake are planned for the 2012/2013 Antarctic field season. The aims of this access experiment are to determine (1) the presence, character, and maintenance of microbial life in Antarctic subglacial lakes and (2) the Quaternary history of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Geophysical data have been used to define a preferred lake access site. The factors that make this location suitable for exploration are (1) a relatively thin overlying ice column (similar to 3.1 km), (2) a significant measured water depth (similar to 143 m), (3) >2 m of sediment below the lake floor, (4) water circulation modeling suggesting a melting ice-water interface, and (5) coring that can target the deepest point of the lake floor away from marginal, localized sediment sources.					; Bentley, Michael/F-7386-2011; Makinson, Keith/A-2495-2013; Wadham, Jemma/G-3138-2014; Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008; Maher, Barbara/K-6234-2012; Corr, Hugh/C-5398-2011; Woodward, John/I-1046-2013; Whalley, Brian/AAF-6547-2020; Smith, Angela/AAV-5948-2021; Pearce, David/KLD-8369-2024; Hindmarsh, Richard/C-1405-2012; Tranter, Martyn/E-3722-2010	Maher, Barbara/0000-0002-8759-8214; Bentley, Michael/0000-0002-2048-0019; Makinson, Keith/0000-0002-5791-1767; Rivera, Andres/0000-0002-2779-4192; Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Mowlem, Matthew/0000-0001-7613-6121; Pearce, David/0000-0001-5292-4596; Hindmarsh, Richard/0000-0003-1633-2416; 													0065-8448		978-0-87590-482-5				2011	192						221	233		10.1029/2010GM000936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010GM000936	10.1029/GM192												WOS:000290418300013

A total of 35 zooplankton taxa, belonging to Rotifera (28), Cladocera (5), and Copepoda (2), were identified. Rotifera was the dominant group in all sampling surveys and accounted for 97% of the zooplankton density in the lake. The average total zooplankton abundance ranged from 993 to 476,912 ind/m3. The maximum and the minimum densities were measured in April and August of 2003, respectively. Seasonal Quantitative contributions of Cladocera and Copepoda to the zooplankton community were insignificant. Keratella During the study period, only rotifer species were found to be quantitatively dominant in the zooplankton community. quadrata, Keratella cochlearis, and Hexarthra oxyuris were the dominant species and were present during the whole year. fluctuations of zooplankton found in the current study disagreed with the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. Shannon's diversity index ranged from 0.61 to 1.67.

Microinvertebrates in aquatic systems have a regulatory effect on juvenile fish production. Microinvertebrates in this study refer to both non- and planktonic microscopic invertebrates such as rotifers, cladocerans, copepods and ostracods. To understand the response of microinvertebrates to flooding of different types of temporary floodplains of the Delta, selected floodplains from primary, secondary and rarely inundated floodplains were sampled for microinvertebrates between May 2009 and February 2010. Field sampling coincided with different hydrological phases of flooding; flood rising, peak flooding and flood recession phase. Vegetation cover, woody debris, and a suite of physicochemical water parameters were assessed at each study floodplain. Woody debris, oxygen saturation (%), turbidity and conductivity were all significantly highest in rarely flooded floodplains (ANOVA, p < 0.05) whereas aquatic vegetation cover was highest in the primary floodplains. Fifty-five species and four taxa of microinvertebrates were identified in the study floodplains. Copepods were the most abundant by density across the study floodplains. During the early stages of flooding micrinvertebrate species richness and diversity were significantly highest in frequently flooded floodplains (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05) and they were lower in rarely flooded floodplains. Soon after inundation of the temporary floodplains until peak flooding, highest microinvertebrate densities (ANOVA, p < 0.05) were observed in the rarely flooded floodplains. Findings of this study indicate that, high flooding frequency of the primary floodplains may be important for the maintenance of high microinvertebrate species richness whereas flooding of rarely flooded floodplains might contribute the highest densities of microinvertebrates to the temporary floodplain food webs. Findings of this study imply that substantial reduction of flooding regimes in the Delta may negatively affect both composition and density of microinvertebrates. Therefore, management and conservation efforts in the Okavango Delta are encouraged to consider balancing human water needs and water needed for the ecological functioning of the system.

The hydrodynamic sub-model solves the non-linear, reduced-gravity equations in which wind is the dominant forcing. The ecological sub-model for the epilimnion comprises nutrients, primary production, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton biomass. In the absence of significant terrestrial input of nutrients, the nutrient loss is compensated for by seasonal, wind-driven, turbulent entrainment of nutrient-rich hypolimnion water into the epilimnion, which gives rise to high plankton productivity twice in the year, during the transition between two seasons. Model simulations predict well the seasonal contrasts of the measured physical and ecological parameters. Numerical tests indicate that the half saturation constant for grazing by zooplankton and the fish predation rate on zooplankton affect the zooplankton biomass measurably more than that of phytoplankton biomass. This work has implications for the application of this model to predict the climatological biological productivity of Lake Tanganyika. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lamb, AL; Leng, MJ; Sloane, HJ; Telford, RJ				Lamb, AL; Leng, MJ; Sloane, HJ; Telford, RJ			A comparison of the palaeoclimate signals from diatom oxygen isotope ratios and carbonate oxygen isotope ratios from a low latitude crater lake	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The analysis of oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) from authigenic lake carbonates has become a well-established palaeoclimate technique. Less common is the use of delta O-18 in biogenic silica (e.g. diatoms, sponge spicules, phytoliths), but the technique is being increasingly utilised for non-carbonate lakes. This paper aims to compare delta O-18(diatom) with delta O-18(carbonate) in a low latitude, closed basin lake. Due to the influence of pH, rarely are both carbonate and diatoms preserved in lake sediments in concentrations high enough to measure oxygen isotopes. The delta O-18 composition of both carbonate and silica should reflect the isotope composition and temperature of the lake water at the time of precipitation and hence theoretically they should be delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(carbonate) currently exists and that found differences between their equivalent. Only one comparative study of delta O-18 compositions, probably because they precipitated in different seasons. Unless there is evidence to suggest that silica and carbonate precipitate at the same time, their delta O-18 records are likely to be different but complementary. In this study, we show that delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite) from Lake Tilo, Ethiopia show some similar broad climate trends. However, the delta O-18(diatom) curve is generally more variable and does not record two regional and events, picked up by the delta O-18(calcite) data. Several possible reasons for this are discussed: the precision of the delta O-18(diatom) extraction technique, contamination of the diatom samples from tephra (volcanic glass), vital effects in the diatom samples, differences in their respective equilibrium isotope fractionation rates and the possibility that the dominant diatom, Aulacoseira granulata, and calcite precipitated in different seasons during this time. Currently, the problems associated with the cleaning and extraction of delta O-18(diatom) suggests that details found in delta O-18(calcite) records may be lost in delta O-18 records where contaminants such as tephra and clay minerals are difficult to remove.

J	Mekkawi, M; Grasso, JR; Schnegg, PA				Mekkawi, M; Grasso, JR; Schnegg, PA			Long-lasting relaxation of seismicity at Aswan reservoir, Egypt, 1982-2001	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The Aswan reservoir seismicity is accepted as an example of reservoir-induced seismicity with the M 5.4 event of 1981, which occurred 15 years after the reservoir impoundment started. During the 1982-2001 period, the Aswan seismicity separates into shallow and deep seismic zones, between 0 and 15 and 15 and 30 km, respectively. These two seismic zones behave differently over time, as indicated by the seismicity rate, depth migration, b-value, and spatial clustering. For the deep events, the rate decreases with time, the depth remains at a constant or increasing depth, and the b-value is lower than for the shallow events, which migrate toward the surface with a close to constant seismicity rate. Of all the previous parameters, only the seismicity rate correlates with seasonal variations of the lake level. This is positive evidence for the Aswan reservoir seismicity to be reservoir triggered in the 1982-2001 period. Clustering over time and space expresses that numerous aftershock sequences are activated, that is, a minimum of 35% of the seismicity, similarly to tectonic seismicity. The observed decrease of the b-value with depth is also a property suggested for natural events. Our results suggest that the Aswan seismicity emerges both from the water-level loading and the interplay between induced earthquakes themselves through numerous standard aftershock sequences. This latter process induces stochastic fluctuations in the seismicity patterns that inhibit a recovery of a simple seismic response to water-level changes. Even though aftershock sequences dominate the temporal fluctuations of seismicity, this does not negate the importance of influence of the reservoir in sustaining this unusual long-lasting seismic episode. During the 1982-2001 period, the Aswan seismicity appears as a power-law relaxation response to the 1981 M 5.4 shock, this response being decorated by long-term (larger than 100 days) water-level changes.					grasso, jean/F-3634-2017; grasso, jean-robert/F-3634-2017	grasso, jean-robert/0000-0002-9580-7864; Mekkawi, Mahmoud/0000-0002-2319-8561													0037-1106	1943-3573				APR	2004	94	2					479	492		10.1785/0120030067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120030067													WOS:000221200900010
J	Bamford, HA; Ko, FC; Baker, JE				Bamford, HA; Ko, FC; Baker, JE			Seasonal and annual air-water exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls across Baltimore Harbor and the northern Chesapeake Bay	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												As part of the Atmospheric Exchange Over Lakes and Oceans Study (AEOLOS), air-water exchange fluxes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined along a transect in the Baltimore Harbor from the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, MD, to the mainstem of the northern Chesapeake Bay to assess the overall contributions of urban source PCBs through air-water exchange and their impacts on coastal waters. Six sites were sampled during three intensive sampling periods in June 1996, February 1997, and July 1997 and at two sites (urban and rural) every ninth day between March 1997 and March 1998 to measure spatial and temporal variability in the PCB air-water exchange fluxes. During the intensive sampling campaigns, net total PCB (t-PCBs) volatilization fluxes ranged between 5 and 2120 ng m(-2) day(-1), varying on both temporal and spatial scales. Volatilization fluxes were highest in February, driven by, high winds and elevated dissolved PCB concentrations: Throughout the annual sampling period, t-PCB volatilization fluxes were similar between urban (130,mug m(-2) yr(-1)) and rural (120 mug m(-2) yr(-1)) sites. Approximately 10% of the dissolved t-PCB inventory in the water column in Baltimore Harbor exchanges with the atmosphere each day: From air-water exchange alone, the estimated residence time of dissolved t-PCBs in the harbor is approximately 10 days (estimated hydraulic residence time of water in the harbor is between 7 and 14 days), indicating that air-water exchange is an efficient removal mechanism of t-PCBs from urban coastal waters. Furthermore, the annual flux of t-PCBs volatilizing from Baltimore Harbor is approximately 12% of the gas-phase t-PCB inventory over the water, and at the northern Chesapeake Bay site, the t-PCB flux is approximately 40% of the gas-phase t-PCB inventory. This suggests that air-water exchange of t-PCBs has the potential to be a significant source of PCBs to the rural atmosphere.

The spatial and temporal structure of EC measurements at this station is evaluated by using the comprehensive software package TK2 together with a footprint model. The obtained high-quality turbulent flux data are used to study the occurrence of FCCs, which can be detected with the EC system by calculating the stability parameter. Two types of generation of FCCs can be identified. (1) During the wind direction change of a diurnal thermally forced land-lake circulation system in the morning, strongly reduced wind speeds and simultaneously high buoyancy fluxes lead to a period of dominance of buoyancy over shear, and hence, to the occurrence of FCCs. (2) On days with the appearance of clouds, the land-lake circulation is weakened or reversed, dependent on the temperature gradients between the land and the Nam Co Lake. During the period of adaptation of the land-lake breeze to the alternating situation of heating differences, wind speeds decrease and buoyancy again dominates over shear near the ground. These are the situations where FCCs are also detected during the entire day at Nam Co station. The investigation of FCCs regarding the whole measurement period shows that FCCs can be mainly attributed to case (1) during the non-monsoon period, while FCCs are generated by both mechanisms (1 and 2) during the monsoon season. An impact of the FCCs on the near-ground profiles of air temperature and humidity is demonstrated. The FCCs are assumed to play an important role for the land surface-atmosphere exchange processes and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions on the TP by providing an effective transport mechanism of near-ground air mass characteristics into upper parts of the ABL.					; Foken, Thomas/HGF-2971-2022	Babel, Wolfgang/0000-0002-5699-5727; Foken, Thomas/0000-0003-4562-9083; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2011	105	1-2					217	228		10.1007/s00704-010-0393-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-010-0393-5													WOS:000293021500019
J	Tricas, TC; Maruska, KP; Rasmussen, LEL				Tricas, TC; Maruska, KP; Rasmussen, LEL			Annual cycles of steroid hormone production, gonad development, and reproductive behavior in the Atlantic stingray	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												The mating season of the Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), which begins in August and continues through April, is the longest documented for any elasmobranch fish. Despite :this protracted mating period, female stingrays ovulate synchronously at the end of the mating season and there is no evidence for sperm storage by females. Thus, the proximate causal factors and ultimate function of this extended preovulatory mating are unknown. Annual cycles of the gonadal steroids testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), and progesterone (P-4) were measured for 26 months in a wild estuarine population of Atlantic stingrays to test for associations with their reproductive biology, gametogenesis, and sexual behavior. Serum androgen levels in males showed four phases within an annual cycle: (1) androgen suppression between reproductive seasons (April-July), (2) primary androgen increase during the onset of spermatocyte development (August-October), (3) androgen decrease following maximum testis growth and spermatocyte development (November-December), and (4) secondary androgen increase during the peak of sperm maturation (January-March). Increases in male E-2 and P-4 were correlated with spermatocyte/spermatocyst formation, maximum testis weight, and the primary (but not secondary) androgen surge. We propose that the production of male androgens across the full seven-month preovulatory:mating period promotes their aggressive reproductive behavior and drives the protracted mating season of this species. In females, serum T and DHT showed relatively brief increases near ovulation, whereas E-2 and P-4 showed brief increases near both ovulation and parturition. The increase in female androgens near ovulation may increase female aggression when they are impregnable by courting males and enhance their choice of mates. This estuary sample population shows higher absolute steroid levels and distinct differences in temporal cycles compared to another Florida fresh water lake population, but the cause and significance of these differences are unknown. Experiments are needed to confirm that the aggressive and protracted mating behavior is the result of prolonged male androgen production and to determine whether the sustained preovulatory mating serves some function related to female reproduction.

Age validation, growth and mortality of introduced Tilapia zillii in Crater Lake Nkuruba, Uganda	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Periodicity and timing of opaque zone formation in otoliths of introduced redbelly tilapia, Tilapia zillii (Gervais), in Crater Lake Nkuruba, Uganda, were validated using marginal increment. Age and growth were assessed through readings of biannuli in thin-sectioned sagittal otoliths. Deposition of opaque zone formation in T.zillii otoliths was bimodal (March-May and September-November), corresponding to two seasonal peaks of precipitation characteristic of this equatorial region. Ages of T.zillii ranged from 2 to 8years, with fish gillnetted offshore having a faster growth and attaining larger size-at-age than fish captured inshore in minnow traps, suggesting that use of multiple gears is needed when estimating the growth of T.zillii. Total instantaneous mortality (Z), estimated using catch curve analysis, was 0.74 for gillnetted fish and 0.71 for trapped fish. These estimates were at the low end of the total mortality reported for other tilapia species. Natural mortality (M) was estimated as 0.52-0.54 by applying Rikhter and Efanov's maximum age at maturity and Hoenig's maximum age methods, respectively. Fishing mortality (F) in Lake Nkuruba was 0.17-0.22, indicating a low exploitation level in the lake.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				FEB	2016	23	1					66	75		10.1111/fme.12163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12163													WOS:000368830700007

Investigation of freshwater sponges spicules deposits in a karstic lake in Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The environmental conditions which contributed to the formation of the notorious quaternary deposits of freshwater sponge spicules in karstic lentic environments in Brazil have been subject of some speculation. No investigation has yet been conducted to test whether these deposits currently originate in karstic lakes. To provide for such an investigation, Serra Negra Lake, which is formed on an ultramafic-alkaline-carbonatite dome at central western Brazil, close to the area of occurrence of the paleo-deposits was selected for the study. Bottom sediments were sampled at 10 stations across the lake, and water was sampled at five of the stations, in June/2011 (rainy season) and October/2011 (dry season). Analysis of granulometry, organic matter and presence of spicules were carried out in the sediments. Lake water was analysed for the main physical and chemical characteristics. Deposit of spicules was restricted to the northern area of the lake, which is rich in macrophyte. The taxonomic analysis of the spicules indicated the contribution of five sponge species, Dosilia pydanieli, Metania spinata, Radiospongilla amazonensis, Trochospongilla variabilis and Heterorotula fistula, which formed large deposits in neighbouring areas. The high silica concentration, derived from the dome volcanic rocks, constant water level and available substrate are credited for the continuous production of sponges and spicules, confirmed by the rare presence of gemmoscleres. The lake is classed as a minerotrophic fen type of bog with a heavy contribution from the surrounding creeks. Lake sediments are fine with high levels of organic matter and peat, which contributed to the trapping of spicules in the sediments.

The spatial and temporal analysis has shown the main relationships between the local forcing factors and the ecological state of the aquatic ecosystems. The spatial geomorphologic characteristics of the wedand were strongly related to the spatial distribution of the limnological variables. According to this, the macrosystem has been classified into three large regions that enclose lakes that share diverse characteristics. (i) Northwestern region encloses few open water areas, mainly of small size. (ii) Rounded large lakes (probably originated as oxbow floodplain lakes) are characteristics of the Northeastern region. (iii) Elongated large lakes (probably originated as levee floodplain lakes) are characteristics of the Southern region. These lakes showed the highest S-d and DOM values and the lowest T-n. The different water drainage of the regions seems to be the main cause of the limnological differences of the wetland. The described spatial classification agrees also with other ecological characteristics such as the degree of macrophytes development or composition of the fish community. Different disturbed local areas, overlapping the regional classification, were also identified in the borders of the wetland. These areas have been related with the presence of anthropogenic activities, revealing the sensitivity of these shallow lakes. The whole system showed a relatively homogenous seasonal pattern of water transparency related with solar irradiance cycle. The variability of active floodplains lakes of the Upper Parand was found to be more strongly influenced by the rainfall, presenting a more unpredictable behaviour. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Keeley, JE				Keeley, JE			CAM photosynthesis in submerged aquatic plants	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a CO2-concentrating mechanism selected in response to aridity in terrestrial habitats, and, in aquatic environments, to ambient limitations of carbon. Evidence is reviewed for its presence in five genera of aquatic vascular plants, including Isoetes, Sagittaria, Vallisneria, Crassula, and Littorella. Initially, aquatic CAM was considered by some to be an oxymoron, but some aquatic species have been studied in sufficient detail to say definitively that they possess CAM photosynthesis. CO2-concentrating mechanisms in photosynthetic organs require a barrier to leakage; e.g., terrestrial C-4 plants have suberized bundle sheath cells and terrestrial CAM plants high stomatal resistance. In aquatic CAM plants the primary barrier to CO2 leakage is the extremely high diffusional resistance of water. This, coupled with the sink provided by extensive intercellular gas space, generates daytime CO2(p(i)) comparable to terrestrial CAM plants. CAM contributes to the carbon budget by both net carbon gain and carbon recycling, and the magnitude of each is environmentally influenced. Aquatic CAM plants inhabit sites where photosynthesis is potentially limited by carbon. Many occupy moderately fertile shallow temporary pools that experience extreme diel fluctuations in carbon availability. CAM plants are able to take advantage of elevated nighttime CO2 levels in these habitats. This gives them a competitive advantage over non-CAM species that are carbon starved during the day and an advantage over species that expend energy in membrane transport of bicarbonate. Some aquatic CAM plants are distributed in highly infertile lakes, where extreme carbon limitation and light are important selective factors. Compilation of reports on diel changes in titratable acidity and malate show 69 out of 180 species have significant overnight accumulation, although evidence is presented discounting CAM in some. It is concluded that similar proportions of the aquatic and terrestrial floras have evolved CAM photosynthesis. Aquatic Isoetes (Lycophyta) represent the oldest lineage of CAM plants and cladistic analysis supports an origin for CAM in seasonal wetlands, from which it has radiated into oligotrophic lakes and into terrestrial habitats. Temperate Zone terrestrial species share many characteristics with amphibious ancestors, which in their temporary terrestrial stage, produce functional stomata and switch from CAM to C-3 Many lacustrine Isoetes have retained the phenotypic plasticity of amphibious species and can adapt to an aerial environment by development of stomata and switching to C3 However, in some neotropical alpine species, adaptations to the lacustrine environment are genetically fixed and these constitutive species fail to produce stomata or loose CAM when artificially maintained in an aerial environment. It is hypothesized that neotropical lacustrine species may be more ancient in origin and have given rise to terrestrial species, which have retained most of the characteristics of their aquatic ancestry, including astomatous leaves, CAM and sediment-based carbon nutrition. In both terrestrial and aquatic CAM plants, dark CO2 fixation may result in net carbon uptake plus the conservation of carbon by refixation of respiratory CO2. In aquatic plants, CAM's contribution to the total carbon budget is variable. Exemplary studies of the contribution of CAM to the carbon budget, such as those by Boston and Adams, Madsen, and Robe and Griffiths for lacustrine species, are needed in a greater range of habitats. Quantitative estimates of the CAM contribution to the carbon budget are likely to provide more insights than attempts to typologically categorize variation with terms such as "idling," "cycling," AAM, SCAM, TAAM, and so forth. Although we have a reasonably good understanding of the selective factors favoring CAM in seasonal pools and oligotrophic lakes, there are other habitats (Section VII.C) where the role of CAM is not apparent. These species need to be examined in greater detail. Future research should focus on species with predictable diel acid fluctuations, but with characteristics that do not fit recognized criteria for CAM. Of particular interest is the seasonal pool species Downingia bella (Campanulaceae), which may reflect an innovative CAM mechanism. Other roles for dark CO2 fixation should be examined. Dark CO2 fixation may be important as a source of carbon skeletons for both carbon and nitrogen assimilation, particularly in nutrient-poor habitats. Of practical concern is the manner in which lake acidification and eutrophication alter carbon budgets (e.g., Robe & Griffiths, 1994). Also, in many parts of the globe aquatic CAM spe-` cies are threatened: I. andicola of Peru, for instance, is clearly threatened by habitat loss (Leon & Young, 1996), and two of the three primitive Isoetes, morphologically similar to the extinct Isoetites, are apparently extinct (Hickey, 1986). At the other extreme, the aquatic CAM Crassula helmsii is an aggressive alien (Dawson & Warman, 1987), in need of further studies such as those of Newman and Raven (1995) in a greater range of habitats. Isoetes, being the oldest lineage of CAM plants, potentially holds further interesting discoveries with respect to photosynthetic patterns. The most primitive species in the group are distinct in their lack of the typical terete "isoetid" leaf. These species are restricted to isolated sites in South America and have seldom been collected. They are apparently basal to the group, sharing the laminate leaf characteristic with the extinct and possibly ancestral Isoetites (Hickey, 1986). The hypothesized amphibious origin for CAM suggests the possibility that these primitive species may lack CAM. Further study of the photosynthetic metabolism and habitat characteristics of these would be a stimulating contribution to the story of aquatic CAM photosynthesis. Here, and in other aspects of aquatic CAM photosynthesis, a multitude of possibilities are presented with new molecular genetic techniques, now being applied to terrestrial CAM plants (Cushman & Bohnert, 1997).																			0006-8101	1874-9372				APR-JUN	1998	64	2					121	175		10.1007/BF02856581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02856581													WOS:000075203700002
J	Mokgedi, L; Nobert, J; Munishi, S				Mokgedi, Leokeditswe; Nobert, Joel; Munishi, Subira			Assessment of lake surface dynamics using satellite imagery and in-situ data; case of Lake Ngami in North-West Botswana	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					18th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Development and Management - Innovative Technological Advances for Water Security in Eastern and Southern Africa	OCT 25-27, 2017	Swakopmund, NAMIBIA	WaterNet, WARFSA, GWPSA				The understanding of surface dynamics of Lake Ngami, a part of Okavango river system is hindered by paucity of data. The aim of this study was to assess the lake surface dynamics using satellite imagery and in-situ data. Surface dynamics of Lake Ngami were monitored using remote sensing methods to complement the available inadequate in-situ measurements. Landsat imagery of the year 1979 to year 2016 were used. The Lake boundary was mapped using the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), where use was made of Histogram thresholding segmentation method in extracting the water pixels. Remotely sensed actual evapo-transpiration (ETa) was estimated using Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) Modelling Approach; while the satellite derived rainfall estimates were obtained from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43V7 satellite imagery product. Precipitation and potential evaporation data from meteorological stations were used to correct the bias of the satellite products. The SSEB method involved the estimation of evaporation fraction using the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-day product (MOD11A2) and GLDAS 0.25 degrees Potential Evapotranspiration version 2.1 for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration. The lake extraction process displayed good results with the average Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of 0.93 and 96.6%, respectively. The maximum extent of Lake Ngami was observed in the year 2012 at 272 km(2). The ETa was found to be in range of 700 mm/year in dry regions to about 2000 mm/year in Okavango delta swamps. From the study, it was observed that after the 2009 flood-event, the precipitation occurring during the rainy season (October-March) at Angola Highlands had a positive relationship with the Lake Ngami surface area, with Pearson correlation of 0.70. Similar findings were noticed when the lake surface area trend was observed against the in-situ flow data at the Mohembo hydrometric station, which is the inflow of the Okavango delta. This suggests that since the floods of 2009, the precipitation in the Angola Highlands has a major influence in the surface dynamics of Lake Ngami.					; Nobert, Joel/ABE-7045-2020	Nobert, Joel/0000-0002-6537-9950; MUNISHI, SUBIRA/0000-0002-4976-0305; 													1474-7065	1873-5193				AUG	2019	112				SI		175	186		10.1016/j.pce.2018.12.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2018.12.008													WOS:000491169000020

Consequently ice, permafrost and snow meltwater is the main source of the Urgos Nala (stream), which supports agriculture and replenishes drinking water sources downstream in the watersheds. The effect of small amount of glacier retreat and changes in seasonal snow cover is critical for the functioning of meltwater and high natural resources dependent mountain communities. Agriculture, vegetation, fodder and pasture land in the watershed are all entirely dependent on meltwater. Therefore, the study aims to make a quantitative and large-scale map of the study area in relation to rural livelihood. Resource mapping (1:5000) and quantitative characterization of Urgos watershed are achieved using high-resolution satellite images, digital elevation models, Total Station mapping, differential Global Positioning System and collection of field evidences. The landform evolution in the watershed is a result of intense glaciofluvial processes in the past as well as present. The geomorphic features mapped in the area reveal multiple glacial advances in the watershed, in the past. This has direct links with climatic fluctuations and its impact on agriculture and allied activities for the sustenance of people. The analysis shows 22.49% area under glacier and only 1.04% area of the entire watershed under agriculture, fodder, pasture and vegetation land. This 1.04% area of the watershed plays a significant role in the livelihood of the people.					; Pandey, Vijendra/AAF-4898-2020; Chand, Pritam/H-5804-2016; Deswal, Sanjay/AAD-9934-2020; Prakash, Satya/HNS-9397-2023	Chand, Pritam/0000-0001-7388-0393; SHAHNAWAZ, Shahnawaz/0000-0002-6403-3528; Deswal, Sanjay/0000-0001-9913-7098													0255-660X	0974-3006				AUG	2019	47	8					1295	1305		10.1007/s12524-019-01002-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-019-01002-9													WOS:000478760100003

This article investigates the predrainage and early postdrainage spatial extent, lake stages, and changes to plant communities. Two periods of time were assessed: predrainage (prior to 1880) and early postdrainage (1880-1945). Analyses were conducted by integrating written historical accounts, lake stages, and hydrographs with a geospatial analysis derived from nautical charts and other historical maps from additional points in time (1913 and 1926). Results indicate that predrainage lake stages were much higher than the current water management regime, but the spatial extent of the lake open water is relatively unchanged. We estimated a reduction in storage volume of Lake Okeechobee from 6,922 million m(3) to 4,347 million m(3) during the early postdrainage period (1880-1945) at high lake stages. This represents a loss in volume of 2,575 million m(3) at a high lake level and of 3,016 million m(3) at a low lake level. The loss in storage volume has changed the historical flow patterns from the Lake Okeechobee region with consequences to downstream watersheds.

Seasonal water quality and trophic status of shallow lentic waters and their association with water levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Extreme hydro-climatic changes associated with floods and drought greatly influence the ecosystem dynamic of tropical lakes in Malaysia, resulting in negative impacts on their water quality and trophic status. This study examined the seasonal changes in water quality and trophic state connected to hydro-ecological changes in a natural lake and two reservoirs. Water levels in the three water bodies varied with changes in rainfall regime, and water regulation for irrigation or water supply. Multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant relationship between season and temperature, pH, conductivity, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a (p<0.05). Drought events and the associated period of low water levels were characterized by high temperature, conductivity and chlorophyll-a levels in these shallow lakes, which probably led to high photosynthetic rates with concomitant increase in dissolved oxygen and pH and decrease in total nitrogen concentration. Elevated chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations were also associated with drought events and the decrease in water level in Bukit Merah Reservoir, possibly due to the release of phosphorus from internal loading resulting from sediment re-suspension by wind. Salinity increase in Durian Tunggal Reservoir during dry season was possibly due to seawater intrusion into river. During the rainy season, transparency in Bera Lake and Bukit Merah Reservoir was strongly influenced by the influxes of the main river that transported elevated levels of suspended solids and nutrients.					; Sharip, Dr. Zati/F-6300-2012; Yusoff, Fatimah/N-7065-2018	Sharip, Zati/0000-0003-3523-1178; Yusoff, Fatimah/0000-0003-4438-9065													1735-1472	1735-2630				AUG	2019	16	8					4851	4862		10.1007/s13762-018-2172-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-2172-2													WOS:000475910400082

Evaluation of constructed wetlands by wastewater purification ability and greenhouse gas emissions	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Domestic wastewater is a significant source of nitrogen and phosphorus, which cause lake eutrophication. Among the wastewater treatment technologies, constructed wetlands are a promising low-cost means of treating point and diffuse sources of domestic wastewater in rural areas. However, the sustainable operation of constructed wetland treatment systems depends upon a high rate conversion of organic and nitrogenous loading into their metabolic gaseous end products, such as N2O and CH4. In this study, we examined and compared the performance of three typical types of constructed wetlands: Free Water Surface (FWS), Subsurface Flow (SF) and Vertical Flow (VF) wetlands. Pollutant removal efficiency and N2O and CH4 emissions were assessed as measures of performance. We found that the pollutant removal rates and gas emissions measured in the wetlands exhibited clear seasonal changes, and these changes were closely associated with plant growth. VF wetlands exhibited stable removal of organic pollutants and NH3-N throughout the experiment regardless of season and showed great potential for CH4 adsorption. SF wetlands showed preferable T-N removal performance and a lower risk of greenhouse gas emissions than FWS wetlands. Soil oxidation reduction potential (ORP) analysis revealed that water flow structure and plant growth influenced constructed wetland oxygen transfer, and these variations resulted in seasonal changes of ORP distribution inside wetlands that were accompanied by fluctuations in pollutant removal and greenhouse gas emissions.																			0273-1223						2007	56	3					49	55		10.2166/wst.2007.517	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2007.517								17802837					WOS:000249058000008
J	Kerkar, S; Bharathi, PAL				Kerkar, S.; Bharathi, P. A. Loka			Stimulation of sulfate-reducing activity at salt-saturation in the salterns of Ribandar, Goa, India	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												In order to address the question if sulfate-reducing activity (SRA) ever becomes arrested at salt saturation, it was measured at 0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 cm depth in sediment cores from the saltpans of Ribandar (Goa) using S-35-sulfate. The activity was related to the abundance of culturable sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and the prevailing environmental conditions. The salinity in these ponds ranged from 10 to 350 psu during the salt producing season. The present study compares the rates ofSRAunder mesohaline (85 psu) and hypersaline conditions (330 psu) as are available in the saltpans during the salt producing season. Variation in culturable abundance of SRB governed 98% and 75% of the variation in SRA at hypersaline and mesohaline conditions, respectively. Though SRA of 3.34 nM center dot g(-1) center dot hr(-1) could be measured at hypersaline conditions of 330 psu, higher SRA of 116.03 nM center dot g(-1) center dot hr(-1) could be measured in mesohaline conditions of 85 psu. These values seem to be higher than the rates reported for Black Sea or tropical mangrove forests. The present study shows that SRA is optimal between a salinity of 60 to 120 psu. Contrary to earlier reports, we hypothesize that SRA is not totally arrested at salt saturation but could instead get retarded. Further, our studies show that availability of an extraneous carbon source could serve to stimulate, and thus counter, the retardation. Our findings suggest that SRA in saturated saltpans is apparently more carbon limited than sulfate limited.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					2007	24	2					101	110		10.1080/01490450701266597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450701266597													WOS:000248266100003

Annual averages of the delta N-15 of plankton (C, LT, E > D, H > POM) matched expected differences in trophic position, but seasonal patterns differed among species. During midsummer, the delta N-15 of D, H, and LT increased above the delta N-15 of E and C, despite little temporal or spatial variation in the delta N-15 of POM (< 41 mu m). Larger size fractions of POM (41-200 mu m) helped explain some of the temporal variability of zooplankton delta N-15. Body size of zooplankton was correlated with delta N-15 for D, C, and E, which could indicate size-based, trophic-level variation; selective feeding; or physiological differences in N-15 enrichment. We propose that detailed time series of delta N-15 for multiple zooplankton species can help determine the seasonal variability of trophic structure in zooplankton assemblages.

The paleoshoreline features were first identified on RADARSAT satellite SAR imagery. We investigated the features during the 1998 field season of the Joint Mongolian-Russian-American Archaeological Expedition to the Gobi-Altai region. We identified paleoshorelines of multiple elevations in the field, which are considered to be relict beach ridges and wave-cut terraces. Other paleolake landforms include spits and Gilbert-type deltas. These landforms are complex, large and well established, implying that the paleolakes were stable for extended periods. The reconstructed paleolakes cover extensive areas of the valley floor, implying that hydrological and climatic conditions were very different in the past. Paleolake expansions may have occurred under a variety of circumstances. One hypothesis is that the high lake stands occurred during the wetter period corresponding to the Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), during the warmest early Holocene and the late Holocene, or during all these periods. If low evaporation rates due to lower temperatures, glacier meltwater and possibly increased precipitation are important factors, then the expansions may have occurred during the terminal Late Glacial period after the Last Glacial Maximum. The greatly expanded lakes in the Gobi-Altai could have significantly affected the Quaternary human demography and migration in the region. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The earliest lithic assemblages, 14,000 to 13,000 calibrated years B.P., at Healy Lake (Chindadn complex) and Swan Point (East Beringian tradition) are distinguished by the presence of microblade and burin technology reminiscent of Dyuktai culture; whereas, the earliest assemblages at Broken Mammoth (Zone 4) and the Mead site lack evidence for this technology. All of these early assemblages are incorporated into an interval called the Beringian Period, at which time a land connection existed between Alaska and Siberia. A similar pattern is exhibited for assemblages dating between about 13,000 and 9500 calibrated years B.P. (the Transitional Period), i.e., Healy Lake, Swan Point, and Gerstle River have microblade and burin technology assigned to the Denali complex, while Broken Mammoth (Zone 3) and Mead do not. Recovered fauna (e.g., elk, bison, small mammals, and birds) show a broad-based economic strategy during both periods. Sample size, seasonality, and site specific activities are explored as possible explanations for the differences among these lithic assemblages.																			0066-6939						2001	38	2					154	170																WOS:000179550800010

To do so, we constructed a preliminary reservoir fish assemblage index (RFAI) to assess the effect of predominantly agricultural land use on two oligotrophic neotropical reservoirs that differed in disturbance level. We first determined the disturbance levels around each reservoir through use of an integrated disturbance index (IDI). The IDI was calculated from the combination of land use metrics at local (Local Disturbance Index - LDI) and buffer scales (Buffer Disturbance Index - BDI). Afterwards, we employed the IDI to assess the response of candidate metrics to environmental disturbance in the RFAI construction. The final RFAI included three metrics selected by range, responsiveness, and redundancy tests. Metrics were scored continuously, and the final RFAI was divided in four quality classes: very poor, poor, acceptable and good. The results showed a clear disturbance gradient in both reservoirs with the IDI values varying between 0.07 and 1.33. However, the IDI values were greater around Volta Grande reservoir because of the predominance of agriculture land use (at local and buffer scales). The RFAI scores in Nova Ponte reservoir were significantly higher than in Volta Grande. All the sites scored as very poor or poor were in Volta Grande and all the sites scored as good were in Nova Ponte. In addition, RFAI scores in the reservoir river arms did not differ from those in the reservoir main body, indicating that it was applicable to both habitat types. Finally, our RFAI scores indicated no significant seasonal difference in the two reservoirs; however, the rainy season produced a greater range and more low scores, particularly in Volta Grande. We related this result to the harmful effect of agriculture and the surface runoff of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Thus, the RFAI was effective in detecting agricultural impacts at the site scale, even in oligotrophic reservoirs.

Bulinus globosus (Planorbidae; Gastropoda) populations in the Lake Victoria basin and coastal Kenya show extreme nuclear genetic differentiation	ACTA TROPICA												Bulinus globosus, a key intermediate host for Schistosoma haematobium that causes urinary schistosomiasis, is a hermaphroditic freshwater Planorbid snail species that inhabits patchy and transient water bodies prone to large seasonal variations in water availability. Although capable of self-fertilizing, this species has been reported to be preferentially out crossing. In this study, we characterized the population genetic structure of 19 B. globosus populations sampled across the Lake Victoria basin and coastal Kenya using four polymorphic microsatellite loci. Population genetic structure was characterized and quantified using F-ST statistics and Bayesian clustering algorithms. The four loci used in this study contained sufficient statistical power to detect low levels of population genetic differentiation and were highly polymorphic with the number of alleles per locus across populations ranging from 16 to 22. Average observed and expected heterozygosities across loci in each population ranged from 0.13 to 0.69 and from 0.39 to 0.79, respectively. Twenty-five of the seventy-six possible population-locus comparisons significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions after Bonferroni corrections, mostly due to the deficiency of heterozygotes. Significant genetic differentiation was observed between populations and Bayesian inferences identified 15 genetic clusters. The excess homozygosity, significant inbreeding and population genetic differentiation observed in B. globosus populations are likely to be due to the habitat patchiness, mating system and the proneness to cyclic extinction and recolonization in transient habitats.

J	Duggan, IC				Duggan, IC			The ecology of periphytic rotifers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The ecology of rotifer assemblages in the periphyton has received little attention relative to that of pelagic rotifers. This paper reviews the ecology of periphytic rotifers, with particular emphasis on the role of macrophytes in the structuring of rotifer assemblages spatially and temporally, and compares these aspects with the dynamics of better known pelagic rotifer communities. Littoral rotifer periphyton communities are typically diverse in lakes, and have composition dissimilar to that of the open water. In rivers, diversity and composition in the pelagic and littoral appear to be similar. Rotifers show preference for macrophyte species they associate with, probably through differences in physical structure or complexity, food concentration or composition, chemical factors, macrophyte age, and differences in the degree of protection from predation provided by macrophytes. These mechanisms are in general not well investigated in rotifers. Factors affecting the seasonal dynamics of periphytic communities appear to be similar to pelagic communities, with seasonal dynamics of substrates and disturbance by flooding or drying also being important.

J	DAVISON, W				DAVISON, W			IRON AND MANGANESE IN LAKES	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The role of redox processes in determining the chemistry of iron and manganese is considered systematically. Both metals have soluble reduced forms and insoluble oxyhydroxides which are readily interconverted in the vicinity of a redox boundary. Although the oxyhydroxides are dominant in well-oxygenated waters, measureable concentrations of Fe(II) and Mn(II) can be observed, especially where photochemical reduction occurs. Differences in behaviour are largely attributed to Fe(II) oxidizing more rapidly than Mn(II) and the relative ease of reduction of manganese oxyhydroxides. Mechanisms of reduction and oxidation, including the role of micro-organisms, are considered. Particulate and colloidal forms, which are the products of oxidation, are seen to have diverse morphometries and compositions and are as yet poorly characterized. They appear to play a smaller role in the transport of trace metals and phosphorus than was once believed. Various lacustrine environments, sediments, the sediment-water interface and anoxic and oxygenated waters, are considered within a unifying context of the processes occurring at a redox boundary. Markedly elevated concentrations of Fe(II) and Mn(II) in anoxic bottom waters have encouraged detailed field studies of their production, transport and oxidation. Results from diverse sites are brought together to provide an overall understanding of the redox cycling of these two important elements in lakes.

Chl-a in temperate lakes oscillates on an annual scale. However, Chl-a oscillations in tropical lakes have hardly been documented, particularly over multiple years. Here, we described the periodicity of the Chl-a by performing a continuous wavelet analysis of 21 years (1998-2018), monthly Chl-a data from tropical, saline Lake Alchichica, Mexico. Parallel wavelet analyses were made on environmental time series (i.e., euphotic zone, mixed layer, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, soluble reactive silica). Throughout the time series, the wavelet transforms identified a regular and predictable annual cycle of the Chl-a associated with the warm-monomictic thermal-mixing pattern, the variability of the annual Chl-a cycle, and the presence of other cyclicities, 2-year and similar to 4-5 years, associated with external forcing agents (e.g., North Pacific Oscillation). The water quality variables display a recurrent annual cycle. At the same time, the trophic variables (nutrient concentration) showed the same cyclicity as Chl-a (1-year, 2-year, and 4-year), suggesting the external forcing agents promote Chl-a augment through nutrient increase made available from stronger, deeper, mixing periods.

However, it remains inadequately understood about what regulate spatial variability of global lake E across seasons. Here we show that vertical vapor pressure difference (e(D)) accounts for 66% of the spatial variability of annual E, followed by wind speed (16%). The e(D) is also the predominant factor modulating diurnal variability in E and causing greater E at night than during the daytime. As a consequence, spatial variability in nighttime E strongly regulates that in global E across seasons. Therefore, the observed widespread, heterogeneous changes in lake surface temperature that imply spatial variability in e(D) may have contributed to changes in global E variability.					; Shen, Lian/D-5718-2014; Farooq, Umar/JFA-0090-2023; Ma, Yulong/ITU-1885-2023	Shen, Lian/0000-0003-3762-3829; Farooq, Umar/0000-0001-6164-1889; 													1748-9326					MAY 1	2022	17	5							054006	10.1088/1748-9326/ac614b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac614b													WOS:000783684300001
J	Wymer, L; Vesper, S; Struewing, I; Allen, J; Lu, JR				Wymer, Larry; Vesper, Stephen; Struewing, Ian; Allen, Joel; Lu, Jingrang			Possible Antagonism between Cladosporium cladosporioides and Microcystis aeruginosa in a Freshwater Lake during Bloom Seasons	LIFE-BASEL												To ensure drinking-water safety, it is necessary to understand the factors that regulate harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) and the toxins they produce. One controlling factor might be any relationship between fungi and the cyanobacteria. To test this possibility, water samples were obtained from Harsha Lake in southwestern Ohio during the 2015, 2016, and 2017 bloom seasons, i.e., late May through September. In each water sample, the concentration of the filamentous fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, and Microcystis aeruginosa microcystin-gene transcript copy number (McyG TCN) was quantified by reverse-transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) analyses. The results showed that during each bloom season, the C. cladosporioides concentration and McyG TCN appeared to be interrelated. Therefore, C. cladosporioides concentrations were statistically evaluated via regression on McyG TCN in the water samples for lag times of 1 to 7 days. The regression equation developed to model the relationship demonstrated that a change in the C. cladosporioides concentration resulted in an opposing change in McyG TCN over an approximately 7-day interval. Although the interaction between C. cladosporioides and McyG TCN was observed in each bloom season, the magnitude of each component varied yearly. To better understand this possible interaction, outdoor Cladosporium spore-count data for the Harsha Lake region were obtained for late May through September of each year from the South West Ohio Air Quality Agency. The average Cladosporium spore count in the outdoor air samples was significantly greater in 2016 than in either 2015 or 2017, and the M. aeruginosa McyG TCN was significantly lower in Harsha Lake water samples in 2016 compared to 2015 or 2017. These results suggest that there might be a "balanced antagonism" between C. cladosporioides and M. aeruginosa during the bloom season.

How does diet influence the reproductive seasonality of tropical freshwater fish?

We explored this hypothesis by studying the relationship between diet and reproductive activity of Creagrutus guanes (Teleostei, Characidae). Our results showed that C. guanes had a generalist and omnivorous diet dominated by aquatic insects (mainly Diptera larvae) and seeds. Creagrutus guanes did not show intersexual or ontogenetic variation in diet. Peaks of feeding activity during rainy months were not synchronized with breeding in dry months. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the reproductive season has to be synchronized with high food consumption. We discussed the hypothesis fat reserves may be an important factor for the desynchronization of peaks of feeding and reproduction as explanation of seasonal breeding of this species.					; Ballesteros, Tania/P-9890-2019; Pinilla, Martha/G-6051-2010	Ballesteros, Tania/0000-0002-2056-5661; Ramirez-Pinilla, Martha Patricia/0000-0002-5921-6223													1679-6225					DEC 18	2009	7	4					693	700		10.1590/S1679-62252009000400019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252009000400019													WOS:000273613900019

The lake itself is the focus for an intensive horticultural industry based upon irrigation from the lake. The Malewa, however, is relatively independent of the impact of industry, and so its contribution to eutrophication of the lake was evaluated. Two periods of study, a very wet- dry and a ' normal' wet-dry season showed that the river contribution of phosphorus led to a total phosphorus loading of 1.4 g m(-2) lake surface ann(-1) in the very wet period compared to 0.2 in the ' normal'. Chlorophyll ' a' in the open water of the lake was significantly related to soluble reactive phosphorus. The lake is now eutrophic by normal limnological criteria.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2002	488	1-3					73	80		10.1023/A:1023362027279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023362027279													WOS:000182300700006

Mercury proxies and mercury dynamics in a forested watershed of the US Northeast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Although many studies focus on mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) dynamics in streams, challenges remain in identifying the relative importance of land cover and seasonality at regulating Hg and MeHg dynamics at the watershed scale. Developing robust proxies for Hg and/or MeHg determination also remains a challenge. Our study used Hg, MeHg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration measurements and various DOC fluorescence indices to characterize Hg and DOC dynamics in a forested watershed of the US Northeast. Principal component analysis indicated that land cover/landscape position (i.e., headwater vs. wetland-influenced area vs. lake-influenced area) explained 44 % of the variance in Hg, MeHg, DOC concentrations, and DOC quality during the snow-free season, while seasonality (i.e., air temperature and discharge) explained only 21 % of the variance in the results. Furthermore, finding a good proxy for Hg that is valid across a range of landscape positions remains a challenge; however, regression analysis indicated that the fluorescence peak Humic C (excitation = 350 nm; emission = max (420-480)), which corresponds to the presence of melanoidins in water, explained 21 % of the variability in MeHg concentrations across both space and time (p = 0.001), and thus appears to be a possible proxy for MeHg determination in our study watershed. From a management perspective, land cover modifications (lake, reservoir, and wetland) are likely to play more important roles at regulating Hg, MeHg, and DOC exports at the watershed scale than long-term changes in the climate of this region.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2014	186	11					7475	7488		10.1007/s10661-014-3941-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3941-0								25017991					WOS:000343051400037
J	Hieber, M; Robinson, CT; Uehlinger, U; Ward, JV				Hieber, M; Robinson, CT; Uehlinger, U; Ward, JV			Are alpine lake outlets less harsh than other alpine streams?	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We investigated the intra-annual chemical and physical properties of 16 lotic systems situated in the Swiss Alps that comprised alpine lake outlets and streams of kryal and rhithral origin. A primary goal of the study was to examine whether alpine lake outlets are less harsh lotic habitats than alpine non-outlet streams, as expected from studies of lowland lake outlets. The presence of a glacier and associated seasonality in glacial melt were primary determinants of environmental conditions in alpine lotic systems through the influence on flow regime, water temperature, and seasonal changes in chemical variables. Lake outlets exhibited higher maximum water temperatures and lower daily temperature fluctuations compared to non-outlet streams. Channel stability of the lotic systems was analyzed using estimates of shear stress, the Pfankuch score (PSI) and a multivariate habitat index (MHI). Indices using shear stress characterized channels with stream slopes greater than or equal to15% as least stable and lake outlets with slopes less than or equal to4% as most stable. PSI and MHI mainly separated rhithral sites as stable and kryal sites as unstable, resulting from differences in discharge patterns. None of the indices resulted in distinct differentiation between the habitat stability of lake outlets and respective streams. Assessment of these indices suggested that it is necessary to incorporate both spatial and temporal changes in habitat parameters to provide a valid measure of the stability of a particular alpine stream type. Our results indicated that the habitat characteristics of alpine lotic systems are mainly controlled by the presence of a glacier and its seasonality, and on a lower hierarchical level by the presence of an upstream lake.

J	Mangan, SA; Adler, GH				Mangan, SA; Adler, GH			Seasonal dispersal of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by spiny rats in a neotropical forest	OECOLOGIA												Many species of neotropical rodents consume and subsequently disperse viable spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Consequently, rodents may be important determinants of both AMF and tree community composition in neotropical forests. We examined the influence of both availability of other food resources and season on the consumption and subsequent dispersal of AMF spores by Proechimys semispinosus (the Central American spiny rat) from seven island populations located in Gatun Lake, Panama over a 13-month period. For each island population, we examined the relationship between monthly spore occurrence in fecal pellets and monthly density of trees and lianas producing ripe fruit. During the last 3 months of this study, five islands were provisioned with extra food, while two islands remained unmanipulated to test experimentally whether spiny rats consumed AMF only as an alternative resource when primary resources (fruit) were scarce. Consumption of AMF was highly seasonal, with spores being most common in fecal samples at the end of the rainy season and least common at the end of the dry season. Cross-correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis indicated that spore occurrence in feces varied synchronously among islands and was related positively to soil moisture and unrelated to natural fruit availability. After inoculation with AMF spores isolated from feces, AMF colonized roots of Paspalum notatum (bahia grass) grown in sterilized soil, and total dry weights of host plants increased, confirming the viability of AMF spores passed by spiny rats. The ubiquity of viable spores from several species of AMF occurring in feces of P. semispinosus implicates this rodent as an important AMF disperser. Furthermore, dispersal of AMF spores by spiny rats was not limited to ephemeral periods of primary resource scarcity, thus suggesting that P. semispinosus may influence tree seedling survival by making spores of their mutualistic fungi available throughout the rainy season, a period critical to the establishment of newly germinated seedlings.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2002	131	4					587	597		10.1007/s00442-002-0907-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0907-7								28547554					WOS:000176218000014

Lake water samples (ca. 5 L) were filtered to separate intracellular microcystin (cell fraction) from extracellular microcystin (filtered lake water fraction). These fractions were analyzed to measure the total quantity of microcystin in lake water. Total amounts of extra-and intracellular microcystin were measured with high performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of intracellular microcystin usually exceeded concentrations of extracellular microcystin (24 out of 26 times). High concentrations of intracellular microcystin were found during the exponential growth phase of the blooms, whereas concentrations of extracellular microcystin were highest at the end of the blooms. However, concentrations of extracellular microcystin remained very small (<4 mu g/L) compared to the levels of intracellular microcystin. The relatively higher percentages of microcystin in filtered lake water (> 20%) at the end of blooms suggests that release of microcystin from cells occurs during senescence and the decomposition period of Microcystis cells.

Isotopic evolution of Glacial Lake Agassiz: New insights from cellulose and porewater isotopic archives	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Significantly differing estimates of the oxygen-isotope composition of Lake Agassiz have been obtained from two coexisting isotopic archives within a sediment core originating from Montcalm, Manitoba, in the southern basin of the ancient proglacial lake. Oxygen-isotope analysis of cellulose extracted from the sediments, which originated during the Lockhart phase similar to 11,700-11,000 C-14 yr BP, suggests that phytoplankton lived in surface waters having delta O-18 around -18 +/- 1%o VSMOW, substantially enriched relative to connate porewaters in the same core, which indicate bottom waters had much lower values of around -24.5 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand VSMOW. This difference may be attributable to seasonal isotopic stratification of the upper part of the water column in the 250 m-deep lake. Modem observations from analogous environments in northern Canada suggest that inflow of evaporatively enriched runoff from the large area of deglaciated terrain contributing to Lake Agassiz, possibly enhanced by evaporation from the surface of the lake itself, could readily account for sufficient seasonal O-18 enrichment in the epilimnion. Sediment porewaters, in contrast, have preserved the isotopic signature of hypolimnion waters supplied by a mixture of glacial meltwater and precipitation-derived runoff from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and lack discernable isotopic alteration by evaporation. These new estimates are combined with inferred lake water compositions from other isotopic archives to develop a speculative framework for the isotopic evolution of the lake, providing improved constraints on the probable isotopic composition of Lake Agassiz outflow over time, which has important implications for efforts to trace and model its changing discharge.

Data on the number of transcranial Dopplers (TCD) performed, HU dosing escalation, and vaccine rates were collected along with the number of school and home visits completed. Results Fifty-three children, adolescents, and young adults completed 288 SCORE clinic visits during the study period; over 75% completed at least three clinic visits. Mean HU dose increased significantly with SCORE clinic care. TCD screening rates increased every year starting in 2018 through 2020 when we added local care coordination. One hundred seventy-three vaccines were administered in SCORE outreach clinics. The PPSV23 vaccines had a 100% acceptance rate, and seasonal influenza had a 75.8% acceptance rate. Conclusion Access to care coordination services and local hematology specialty care alleviates barriers to care and enables comprehensive SCD care delivery to children in need. Prior to the establishment of the SCORE clinic, 75% of children in Lake County were not receiving recommended stroke screening. The SCORE clinic model demonstrates feasibility and impact when delivering on the promise of high-quality care for children with SCD.					; Bloom, Ellen/KFQ-8131-2024	Bloom, Ellen/0000-0003-4816-9094; 													1545-5009	1545-5017				AUG	2022	69	8							e29619	10.1002/pbc.29619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29619		APR 2022						35441446					WOS:000783746200001
J	Peterson, MI; Kitano, S				Peterson, Miles, I; Kitano, Satoshi			Spawning season and nest guarding behavior of invasive smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in a Japanese Lake	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Spawning of invasive smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) was studied in 2020 and 2021, in Lake Nojiri, Nagano, Japan. Male smallmouth bass began nest construction once water temperatures reached 14 degrees C, and eggs progressed to fry dispersal in approximately 2 weeks. The main spawning season was in late May through early June, with a smaller second peak of nests in late June through early July. Nests were constructed primarily under dock cover, and nest size and depth were positively correlated with male body size. Of the nests that received eggs, nearly all progressed successfully to fry dispersal. Time lapse videos of male guarding behavior revealed that as nests progressed, males rotated less and were suspended off the bottom substrate. Similarly, the presence of egg predators was determined by experimental removal of guarding males. Freshwater gobies (Rhinogobius kurodai) were the only egg predators observed and arrived on all nests in the egg stage. However, only a handful of gobies visited each nest, the total number of eggs predated was low, and eggs or alevins in the progressed stage were rarely predated. These results indicate that in Lake Nojiri, smallmouth bass spawning is highly successful and egg predators appear to have minimal effect on egg survival. The stable smallmouth bass fishery without stocking at this lake is likely a product of these favorable spawning conditions. The lack of native egg predators may also be a driving factor in the continued spread of smallmouth bass throughout Japan.

Early Holocene environments on October Revolution Island, Severnaya Zemlya, Arctic Russia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pollen, palynomorphs, and rhizopods were studied from several < 1 m thick, peaty and silty sediment sections on southwestern October Revolution Island, Severnaya Zemlya. Six AMS radiocarbon ages from the sections show that peat accumulation started at ca. 11,500 and stopped after 9500 cal. yr BP, consistent with several previously reported 14 C ages. Open steppe-like vegetation existed on the island during the late Glacial, shortly before the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Environmental conditions on the island were most favourable for local biota during the early Holocene, ca. 11,500-9500 cal. yr BR when tundra-like sedge-grass communities dominated the vegetation. Low shrub tundra associations with dwarf birch and willow grew in more wind-sheltered localities. The temperatures during the growing season were at least 4 degrees C higher than today. The Vavilov Ice Cap was at or behind its present margins. Environmental conditions in the region changed significantly ca. 9400 cal. yr BP as a result of colder and drier conditions, when vegetation became similar to the modern, sparse lichen-moss-grass cover.

Development of abundance and size structure of young-of-the-year perch populations using three methods	FISHERIES RESEARCH					Conference on Fish Stock Assessment Methods for Lakes and Reservoirs - Toward the True Picture of Fish Stock	SEP, 2007	Ceske Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC					The reliable assessment of fish populations, which can vary in their spatial and demographic structure, assumes that the results are independent of the assessment method used. To test this assumption for the size structure of the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of perch, three gravel pit lakes and four shallow ponds were monitored using three sampling methods from May to October. While bongo nets were used for early juveniles in the pelagic zone, electrofishing and multi-mesh gillnets were used later in the year when perch had moved to the littoral zone. Since bigger perch (post-larvae) switch from the pelagic to the littoral zone during ontogenesis, bongo net catches during June in the pelagic area of the lakes sampled only the smaller perch, while Simultaneous electrofishing in the littoral zone caught bigger perch. Layer in the season in the littoral zone, smaller perch were caught only by electrofishing and the bigger ones with gillnets. Monthly samples caught by electrofishing and gillnets in the experimental ponds from June to September showed even larger differences between the sizes of perch. Because the size distribution of the YOY perch cohort in the ponds had broadened considerably, there was sometimes no overlap in the length-frequency distributions between the two methods used, clearly demonstrating that using a single method is not Sufficient for drawing a complete picture of the population size structure. This was verified by the removal of fish from the experimental ponds in October. Our results give clear evidence (and thus confirm previous studies) that using one method alone would result in an incomplete picture of the development of the size structure of the YOY perch population, due to the facts that (I) not all perch switch simultaneously between different habitats during ontogenesis and (2) that swimming performance, habitat-specific occurrence and activity change with size, thus affecting the method-specific catchability. Consequently, at least two appropriate methods must be used in an overlapping/parallel sampling design in order to draw a reliable picture of the development of the YOY perch population in any given body of water.

J	Houston, SH; Shaffer, WA; Powell, MD; Chen, J				Houston, SH; Shaffer, WA; Powell, MD; Chen, J			Comparisons of HRD and SLOSH surface wind fields in hurricanes: Implications for storm surge modeling	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Surface wind observations analyzed by the Hurricane Research Division (HRD) were compared to those computed by the parametric wind model used in the National Weather Service Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model's storm surge computations for seven cases in five recent hurricanes. In six cases, the differences between the SLOSH and HRD surface peak wind speeds were 6% or less, but in one case (Hurricane Emily of 1993) the SLOSH computed peak wind speeds were 15% less than the HRD. In all seven cases, statistics for the modeled and analyzed wind fields showed that for the region of strongest winds, the mean SLOSH wind speed was 14% greater than that of the HRD and the mean inflow angle for SLOSH was 19 degrees less than that of the HRD. The radii beyond the region of strongest winds in the seven cases had mean wind speed and inflow angle differences that were very small. The SLOSH computed peak storm surges usually compared closely to the observed values of storm surge in the region of the maximum wind speeds, except Hurricane Emily where SLOSH underestimated the peak surge. HRD's observation-based wind fields were input to SLOSH for storm surge hindcasts of Hurricanes Emily and Opal (1995). In Opal, the HRD input produced nearly the same computed storm surges as those computed from the SLOSH parametric wind model, and the calculated surge was insensitive to perturbations in the HRD wind held. For Emily, observation-based winds produced a computed storm surge that was closer to the peak observed surge, confirming that the computed surge in Pamlico Sound was sensitive to atmospheric forcing. Using real-time, observation-based winds in SLOSH would likely improve storm surge computations in landfalling hurricanes affected by synoptic and mesoscale factors that are not accounted for in parametric models (e.g., a strongly sheared environment, convective asymmetries, and stably stratified boundary layers). An accurate diagnosis of storm surge flooding, based on the actual track and wind fields could be supplied to emergency management agencies, government officials, and utilities to help with damage assessment and recovery efforts.

J	Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA				Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA			Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon mass balances in central Ontario lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO2 evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derive DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.

Evaluating climatic and non-climatic influences on ion chemistry in natural and man-made lakes of Nebraska, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Conductivity and major ion chemistry data were analyzed for a suite of Nebraska (USA) natural lakes, reservoirs, sand pits, and barrow pits to evaluate the magnitude of climatic versus non-climatic influence on ionic concentration and composition. In both natural lakes and sand and barrow pits, conductivity is positively related to longitude and reflects decreasing effective moisture from east to west. Reservoirs showed no relationship between lake conductivity and location, probably because the reservoirs are very strongly influenced by groundwater and surface water inflow and have shorter residence times relative to the other lake types. At smaller spatial scales, conductivity among natural lakes is variable. Lakes that are at low elevation within a groundwater flow system were fresh, because of substantial input of fresh groundwater. In contrast, lakes at high elevation exhibited a wide range of conductivity, probably because of differences in the degree of connection to groundwater and surface to volume ratio impacts on evaporation rates. Differences also were evident among natural lakes in terms of their response to seasonal changes in precipitation. Sub-saline and saline lakes showed more seasonal variation in conductivity than freshwater lakes, and lakes in the more arid part of the state showed larger responses to precipitation change than those in areas to the east that receive higher precipitation.																			0018-8158					OCT	2007	591						103	115		10.1007/s10750-007-0798-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0798-z													WOS:000248975700010

Consumption of two exotic zooplankton by alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) in three Laurentian Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Introductions of the zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi into the Great Lakes have drawn attention surrounding their suitability as prey for zooplanktivorous fishes. We used gut contents and stable carbon isotopes to quantify differential consumption and selection of the exotics by alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Ostnerus mordax) in Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario. The exotics were more often consumed by alewife (up to 70% of gut content biomass) than by smelt (up to 25% of gut content biomass). Measured stable carbon isotope ratios of fish and ratios predicted from mixing models confirmed that the "snapshot" descriptions of diet through gut contents were representative of longer-term diets. While B. longimanus generally was selected for (14 of 17 sampling dates), C. pengoi was not a preferred prey item. Cercopagis pengoi was sometimes a large component of alewife diet because of its high densities in the environment. The exotic zooplankton are more important for alewife than for smelt, and consumption of the cladocerans varies throughout the growing season and among lakes, generally related to patterns of exotic abundance. Effects associated with consumption of the exotics should be high in alewife-dominated systems invaded by B. longimanus or large numbers of C. pengoi.

Evaluating Multiple Arthropod Taxa as Indicators of Invertebrate Diversity in Old Fields	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Biodiversity, often quantified by species richness, is commonly used to evaluate and monitor the health of ecosystems and as a tool for conservation planning. The use of one or more focal taxa as surrogates or indicators of larger taxonomic diversity can greatly expedite the process of biodiversity measurement. This is especially true when studying diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna. Before indicator taxa are employed, however, research into their suitability as indicators of greater taxonomic diversity in an area is needed. We sampled invertebrate diversity in old fields in southern Michigan using pitfall trapping and morphospecies designations after identification to order or family. Correlation analysis was used to assess species richness relationships between focal arthropod taxa and general invertebrate diversity. Relationships were assessed at two fine spatial scales: within sampling patches, and locally across four sampling patches. Cumulative richness of all assessed taxa increased proportionately with cumulative invertebrate richness as sampling intensity increased within patches. At the among-patch scale, we tentatively identified Hemiptera and Coleoptera as effective indicator taxa of greater invertebrate richness. Although Hymenoptera, Araneae and Diptera exhibited high species richness, their total richness within patches was not associated with overall invertebrate richness among patches. Increased sampling throughout the active season and across a greater number of habitat patches should be conducted before adopting Hemiptera and Coleoptera as definitive indicators of general invertebrate richness in the Great Lakes region. Multiple sampling techniques, in addition to pitfall trapping, should also be added to overcome capture biases associated with each technique.

Burbot travelled at a greater rate during all seasons (3.36 km day(-1)) at discharges > 300 m(3) s(-1) (mean = 1.84 km day(-1)) than at discharges > 300 m(3) s(-1) but no difference was found for the pre-spawning and spawning period.

Eggs were collected from fish in a mercury (Hg)-polluted environment (Clay Lake, Ontario, Canada), and from fish in two relatively pristine lakes (Lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba). Both bioaccumulation of Hg into muscle and its mobilization into eggs was significantly higher in Clay Lake females. Maternal muscle MeHg concentration was positively correlated with female length and egg MeHg was positively correlated with muscle MeHg concentration in all three populations. Hatching success of eggs from all three stocks declined significantly with increasing waterborne MeHg (0.1-7.8 ng l(-1)). Hatching success was not significantly affected by egg MeHg concentration. Embryonic heart rate declined with increasing waterborne MeHg concentration, but larval growth was not affected.. Occurrence of larval deformities was negatively correlated with size of female, but was not significantly correlated with MeHg in either eggs or water. Larval MeHg was positively correlated with the concentrations of MeHg in eggs demonstrating transmission of MeHg from females. Uptake of ambient MeHg was higher in larvae exposed to higher waterborne MeHg concentrations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model incorporates pond water depth, food availability, fish stocking densities, fish and fingerling weights at stocking, reproduction rate, manure type and application rates. The ponds were fertilized fortnightly with 1042 kg ha-1 chicken manure. The model captured the dynamics of hydrology, nutrients and fish and demonstrated that similar fundamental processes underlie fish production in these systems. The model predicted annual fish yields of up to 2800 kg ha-1. Simulated fish production, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic N concentrations were comparable with field measurements. Using the model, N budgets and estimates of all N flows were made. Most of the N input into the ponds (60-70%) accumulated in the bottom detritus of the pond and only 8-10% was converted into fish biomass, of which about half consisted of small fish. Fish production in Fingerponds was limited by turbidity induced light limitation and by nutrient limitation. Reduction of variability of fish production should come from reduced turbidity and sufficient nutrient input to minimize light limitation and maximize fish growth.					van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013; KIPKEMBOI, JULIUS/ABF-1956-2021														1355-557X					DEC	2010	42	1					74	90		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02563.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02563.x													WOS:000285206000010

Sm. a structuring factor for macrozoobenthos and selected abiotic parameters of water and bottom sediments throughout the year?	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Studies on the role of nymphaeids in water bodies are uncommon, despite the fact that they often dominate in eutrophic lakes. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effect of a nymphaeid Nuphar lutea on its environment. We hypothesised that its presence can increase the diversity and abundance of zoobenthos, as well as modify selected abiotic parameters, both during the growing season (in the presence of leaves) and outside it (with underground structures only). Three pairs of stations (within and outside Nuphar stands) were established in two shallow, eutrophic lakes and sampled monthly during an entire year. Zoobenthos taxon richness, biodiversity and total density were higher among nymphaeids throughout the year. On the other hand, total zoobenthos biomass was not affected by the presence of plants. Most macroinvertebrates reached higher densities within Nuphar stands, the most abundant being Polypedilum nubeculosum, Potamothrix bavaricus, Ephemeroptera and Ceratopogonidae. In turn, Potamothrix hammoniensis, Chaoborus sp. and Tanypus sp. were more abundant outside the stands. Other taxa, including the dominants (Chironomus sp., Procladius spp., Einfeldia dissidens, Valvata piscinalis), were not affected by the presence of Nuphar. Nuphar did not influence water temperature, oxygen concentration, and conductivity, though sediments within the stands exhibited lower water content and higher proportion of large organic particles. Thus, Nuphar effect on macroinvertebrates was probably direct, through increased habitat heterogeneity, physical stability of substratum and food availability. Our study has shown that nymphaeids, despite their structural distinctness, can affect positively bottom fauna similarly to other morphological groups of plants.

J	Smith, LK; Lewis, WM; Chanton, JP; Cronin, G; Hamilton, SK				Smith, LK; Lewis, WM; Chanton, JP; Cronin, G; Hamilton, SK			Methane emissions from the Orinoco River floodplain, Venezuela	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Methane emissions were measured over a 17-month interval at 21 locations on the Orinoco fringing floodplain and upper delta (total area, 14,000 km(2)). Emissions totaled 0.17 Tg yr(-1), or 7.1 mmol d(-1) (114 mg d(-1); standard deviation, +/- 18%) per m(2) of water surface. Ebullition accounted for 65% of emissions. Emission rates were about five times as high for floodplain forest as for open water or macrophyte mats. Emission rates were positively correlated with carbon content of sediment and amount of methane in the water column, and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, but the correlations were weak. Emission from floodplain soils occurred only when the water content of soil exceeded 25%, which occurred within 20 m of standing water during floodplain drainage (3 months/yr). Bare soils emitted 60 mmol/day per m of shoreline length; soils covered by stranded macrophyte beds emitted five times this amount. Total emissions were accounted for primarily by flooded forest (94%); macrophyte mats, open water, and exposed soils made only small contributions. The flux-weighted mean delta(1)3C for the floodplain was -62 +/- 8 parts per thousand; for delta D the mean was -271 +/- 27 parts per thousand. The delta(13)C and delta D were negatively correlated. Overall emission rates were notably lower than for the Amazon. The depth and duration of flooding are considerably less for the Orinoco than for the Amazon floodplain; oxygen over sediments is the rule for the Orinoco but not for the Amazon. The Orinoco data illustrate the difficulty of generalizing emission rates. Current information for tropical America, including revised estimates for inundated area along the Amazon, indicate that methane emissions from tropical floodplains have been overestimated.

Survival and mortality of green-winged teal banded on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Despite the importance of green-winged teal (Anas crecca) as a harvested species in North America, recent information on variation in vital rates among regions is lacking. We used band recovery data and hierarchical autoregressive models to examine temporal and age-sex-class variation in survival, hunting mortality, and nonhunting mortality probabilities of green-winged teal banded at Kgun Lake on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, USA, from 1997-2019. We used data from 10,554 adult and juvenile green-winged teal of known sex and age banded and released at Kgun Lake, and 1,245 hunter recoveries. Estimates of annual survival probability for adult females and males ranged from 0.44 (95% CI = 0.29-0.54) to 0.49 (95% CI = 0.37-0.68) and 0.56 (95% CI = 0.50-0.61) to 0.58 (95% CI = 0.50-0.64), respectively, during our study period. Estimates of annual survival probability for juvenile females and males ranged from 0.36 (95% CI = 0.18-0.56) to 0.46 (95% CI = 0.31-0.71) and 0.51 (95% CI = 0.38-0.61) to 0.56 (95% CI = 0.44-0.71), respectively. Hunting mortality probability was greatest for juvenile males and least for adult females. Hunting mortality probability of juvenile males increased from 0.09 (95% CI = 0.05-0.13) in 1997 to 0.14 (95% CI = 0.11-0.18) in 2015. Nonhunting mortality probability was greater and more variable than hunting mortality probability for all age-sex classes, indicating nonhunting mortality contributed most to total mortality of green-winged teal banded at Kgun Lake during our study. Additionally, survival probability of female green-winged teal banded at Kgun Lake is less than published estimates for green-winged teal banded in the boreal forest of Alaska. We recommend continuing consistent banding operations for green-winged teal on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and other important breeding areas to further understand factors influencing nonhunting mortality and how they may vary seasonally and geographically.

Massey			SOURCES AND FATE OF CHIRAL ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES IN WESTERN US NATIONAL PARK ECOSYSTEMS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The enantiomer fractions (EFs) of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), cis-, trans-, and oxychlordane, and heptachlor epoxide were measured in 73 snow, fish, and sediment samples collected from remote lake catchments, over a wide range of latitudes, in seven western U.S. National Parks/Preserves to investigate their sources, fate, accumulation and biotransformation in these ecosystems. The present study is novel because these lakes had no inflow or outflow, and the measurement of chiral organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) EFs in snowpack from these lake catchments provided a better understanding of the OCP sources in the western United States, whereas their measurement in fish and sediment provided a better understanding of their biotic transformations within the lake catchments. Nonracemic alpha-HCH was measured in seasonal snowpack collected from continental U.S. National Parks, and racemic alpha-HCH was measured in seasonal snowpack collected from the Alaskan parks, suggesting the influence of regional sources to the continental U.S. parks and long-range sources to the Alaskan parks. The alpha-HCH EFs measured in trout collected from the lake catchments were similar to the alpha-HCH EFs measured in seasonal snowpack collected from the same lake catchments, suggesting that these fish did not biotransform alpha-HCH enantioselectively. Racemic cis-chlordane was measured in seasonal snowpack and sediment collected from Sequoia, indicating that it had not undergone significant enantioselective biotransformation in urban soils since its use as a termiticide in the surrounding urban areas. However, nonracemic cis-chlordane was measured in seasonal snowpack and sediments from the Rocky Mountains, suggesting that cis-chlordane does undergo enantioselective biotransformation in agricultural soils. The trout from these lakes showed preferential biotransformation of the (+)-enantiomer of cis-chlordane and the (-)-enantiomer of trans-chlordane. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:1533-1538.

J	Xu, YY; Shao, ML; Han, XQ; Cai, QH				Xu, Yaoyang; Shao, Meiling; Han, Xinqin; Cai, Qinghua			Temporal Asynchrony of Trophic Status Between Mainstream and Tributary Bay Within a Giant Dendritic Reservoir: The Role of Local-Scale Regulators	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Limnologists have regarded temporal coherence (synchrony) as a powerful tool for identifying the relative importance of local-scale regulators and regional climatic drivers on lake ecosystems. Limnological studies on Asian reservoirs have emphasized that climate and hydrology under the influences of monsoon are dominant factors regulating seasonal patterns of lake trophic status; yet, little is known of synchrony or asynchrony of trophic status in the single reservoir ecosystem. Based on monthly monitoring data of chlorophyll a, transparency, nutrients, and nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) during 1-year period, the present study evaluated temporal coherence to test whether local-scale regulators disturb the seasonal dynamics of trophic state indices (TSI) in a giant dendritic reservoir, China (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR). Reservoir-wide coherences for TSI(CHL), TSI(SD), and TSI(TP) showed dramatic variations over spatial scale, indicating temporal asynchrony of trophic status. Following the concept of TSI differences, algal productivity in the mainstream of TGR and Xiangxi Bay except the upstream of the bay were always limited by nonalgal turbidity (TSI(CHL)-TSI(SD) < 0) rather than nitrogen and phosphorus (TSI(CHL)-TSI(TN) < 0 and TSI(CHL)-TSI(TP) < 0). The coherence analysis for TSI differences showed that local processes of Xiangxi Bay were the main responsible for local asynchrony of nonalgal turbidity limitation levels. Regression analysis further proved that local temporal asynchrony for TSI(SD) and nonalgal turbidity limitation levels were regulated by local dynamics of NVSS, rather than geographical distance. The implications of the present study are to emphasize that the results of trophic status obtained from a single environment (reservoir mainstream) cannot be extrapolated to other environments (tributary bay) in a way that would allow its use as a sentinel site.

J	Käki, T; Ojala, A; Kankaala, P				Käki, T; Ojala, A; Kankaala, P			Diel variation in methane emissions from stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and Typha latifolia L. in a boreal lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												Methane emission from Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia stands was quantified in Lake Vesijarvi, southern Finland. There were differences in emission rates at different times of the day in all the vegetation zones studies, but a clear pattern was found only occasionally. In the inner reed zone with shallow water (<2 cm) the lowest emissions were usually recorded at night when the rates varied from 0.5 to 11.8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The pattern in diel emissions became more obvious towards the end of the growing season and the difference between the night and day emissions was highest in August, when the rates were 3.3 and 85.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) at 00.00 and 12.00 h, respectively. Significant differences in emission rates between night and day were only recorded in August and September. In the mixed cattail-reed zone the pattern in emission rates was more obscure than in pure stands of reed. The ratios between the lowest and highest emissions were similar to those determined in the inner reed zone; in August, when the pattern was clearest, the ratio was 0.18. No patterns of emissions were observed in the outer reed zone, where the water depth was > 10 cm and the number of shoots low. The emissions were highest in this zone, but most of them took place through ebullition. In July, when the emissions were maximal, the plant-mediated rates of emissions varied from 15.5 to 80.0 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and ebullition from 29.5 to 55.8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). In the inner reed zone the diel changes could be related to irradiance, whereas in the mixed cattail-reed zone this relation was not clear. The role of temperature in diel variations was even more modest than that of irradiance. Neither of the species closed stomata at night, but still showed diel patterns in lacunal methane concentrations. Methane probably escaped through the lower part (< 10 cm above the sediment surface) of the stems as the lacunal methane concentrations were always highest here. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Laval, BE; Imberger, J; Findikakis, AN				Laval, BE; Imberger, J; Findikakis, AN			Dynamics of a large tropical lake: Lake Maracaibo	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The dynamics of a large tropical lake, Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, are described using field data and the 3D Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM). ADCP data from November 1998 and CTD data spanning September 1998 to April 1999 are presented. Seawater enters Lake Maracaibo via an augmented natural connection to the Gulf of Venezuela, which allows an influx of seawater and results in almost perenial salt stratification within the lake. Spatially varying wind forcing is found to be necessary to simulate an observed basin-scale cyclonic gyre. The gyre maintains a doming of isopycnals through a geostrophic balance that lifts high-salinity bottom water closer to the surface where it is entrained into the surface mixing layer and subsequently advected by wind-induced circulations. Horizontal excursions of saline bottom water result in considerable variability of salinity stratification at any given location in the lake. September to December (wet season) was characterized by relatively high river inflow and weak winds, resulting in weak forcing of lake circulation and weak basin-wide vertical salt flux. January to April (dry season) was characterized by relatively weak river inflow and strong winds, resulting in strong forcing of lake circulation and enhanced, basin-wide vertical salt flux. The dry season of 1999 was relatively wet (compared with other dry seasons, but still drier than the previous wet season) and there was no indication of a saline underflow occurring from Maracaibo Strait into Lake Maracaibo. The combination of strong wind forcing, low river inflow (compared with the wet season), and little or no saline intrusion during the dry season of 1999 resulted in almost complete flushing of saline bottom water.

J	Aresco, MJ				Aresco, MJ			Reproductive ecology of Pseudemys floridana and Trachemys scripta (Testudines: Emydidae) in northwestern Florida	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												The Cooter, Pseudemys floridana, and the Pond Slider, Trachemys scripta, are two abundant freshwater turtles in the southeastern United States, but little is known of their reproductive ecology in northwestern Florida. I studied their nesting phenology and behavior, clutch size and frequency, rates of nest predation, and hatchling overwintering behavior from 2001-2003 at Lake Jackson, Leon County Florida. Both species nested from mid-April to mid-July with peaks in May (47% of P. floridana and 55% of T. scripta nests). All 43 nests of P. floridana had a central chamber and two side holes. Nest predation on both species was high and may have been caused by a combination of artificial habitats (road-side and drift fences). Mammalian predators and imported red fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) destroyed all or part of 99 nests (98%; P. floridana, N = 30; T. scripta, N = 69) found at drift fences. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) destroyed eggs in all three chambers in 24 of 26 nests of P. floridana. Mean clutch size for P. floridana was 12.4 eggs and female size and clutch size were positively related. Mean clutch size for T. scripta was 6.6 eggs. There was a weak positive relationship between female size and clutch size of T. scripta. Some hatchling P. floridana and T. scripta emerged from mid-July to early October in the year of oviposition, whereas others remained in nests for up to 10 months and emerged from February to May in the following year. A review of published literature reveals that some reproductive traits, such as nesting season, that vary geographically in P. floridana do not vary substantially among populations of T. scripta. Geographic variation in some reproductive characteristics of P. floridana is apparently the result of a gradient in temperature whereas others (e.g., unique behavioral traits) may be adaptations to past or present regional conditions.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				JUN	2004	38	2					249	256		10.1670/169-03A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/169-03A													WOS:000222452800014
J	Leavitt, SW				Leavitt, SW			Prospects for reconstruction of seasonal environment from tree-ring δ13C:: baseline findings from the Great Lakes area, USA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Plant delta(13)C and discrimination (Delta approximate to delta(13)C(air) - delta(13)C(plant)) embody ecophysiological response to environmental conditions influencing rates of carbon fixation and stomatal conductance. This study scrutinizes the seasonal variation of delta(13)C and Delta in growth rings developed in 1990, as represented in trees of 11 species at three sites along a 5degrees latitude transect in Illinois and Wisconsin, USA. Radial stem xylem growth of the trees was monitored with monthly punch cores, and the resulting growth curves precisely identified the growth period represented in the five segments into which each growth ring was subdivided. Seasonal delta(13)C variation of cellulose was usually 1-1.5parts per thousand, and the seasonal patterns were similar among angiosperm and conifer trees at a site, with angiosperms generally C-13-depleted by 0.5-1.5parts per thousand. Seasonal delta(13)C (and Delta) patterns was different among sites, however, and regression with several environmental parameters revealed most frequent significant correlation with soil moisture (Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]). The site-averaged seasonal patterns track each of their divergent local seasonal drought index chronologies very well, even when isotopic curves of the different trees are simply averaged without adjustment for different growth rates. Seasonal tree-ring delta(13)C analysis is affirmed as a valuable method for assessing seasonal moisture status. Furthermore, results favor successful extension to ancient tree rings where different species and slope aspects may be represented in wood samples at a collection site, and where rates of ring development and seasonal delta(13)C(air) are not likely to be known.

Diversity and Distribution of Freshwater Fish Assemblages in Lake Taal River Systems in Batangas, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												An ichthyofaunal survey was conducted to evaluate the diversity and distribution of freshwater fishes in Looc, Magapi (inlets), and Pansipit (outlet) rivers surrounding Lake Taal (Batangas, Philippines) during the wet (July) and dry season (January) of 2011. The study collected 3,342 individuals comprising 37 species (19 families). In terms of fish species richness, 36 species were identified in Pansipit, whereas Looc and Magapi had 21 species each. The fish samples were mostly included eurayhaline, secondary freshwater fishes. The three most abundant groups were eleotrids, cichlids, and gobiids. Shannon-Weiner's diversity indices ranged from 2.17-3.05, which suggest that the studied rivers were moderately to slightly impacted Significant differences in the composition and abundance of native and introduced fishes for the two sampling seasons were also observed (P<0.05), with native species being generally more diverse and abundant than non-native species. A high similarity level (>76%) was computed in the abundance data among the studied rivers. Canonical correspondence analysis identified the distance to the adjacent sea, depth, and vegetation as the most important environmental parameters influencing the distribution of fish assemblages. Baseline dataset from this study can be coordinated to concerned entities as a rational basis for future conservation and rehabilitation endeavors of Lake Taal river systems.																			0119-1144						2016	19	1					85	95																WOS:000379093400009

AUTOMATED WETLAND DELINEATION FROM MULTI-FREQUENCY AND MULTI-POLARIZED SAR IMAGES IN HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd ISPRS Congress	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Water scarcity is one of the main challenges posed by the changing climate. Especially in semi-arid regions where water reservoirs are filled during the very short rainy season, but have to store enough water for the extremely long dry season, the intelligent handling of water resources is vital. This study focusses on Lac Bam in Burkina Faso, which is the largest natural lake of the country and of high importance for the local inhabitants for irrigated farming, animal watering, and extraction of water for drinking and sanitation. With respect to the competition for water resources an independent area-wide monitoring system is essential for the acceptance of any decision maker. The following contribution introduces a weather and illumination independent monitoring system for the automated wetland delineation with a high temporal (about two weeks) and a high spatial sampling (about five meters). The similarities of the multispectral and multi-polarized SAR acquisitions by RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X are studied as well as the differences. The results indicate that even basic approaches without pre-classification time series analysis or post-classification filtering are already enough to establish a monitoring system of prime importance for a whole region.

Paleogeography of Accumulation of the Middle-Upper Permian Red Mudstones in the Kazan Volga Region	UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI												In this work we focus on sedimentology, mineralogy, grain size, and geochemistry of red mudstones of the Urzhumian (Wordian) and Severodvinian (Capitinian) reference section of the Monastyrskii ravine to specify their depositional settings and paleoclimatic conditions. In the section, two types of mudstones have been identified based on their structure: a) massive and b) laminated. The former ones do not contain faunal and plant remains and are often altered by pedogenic processes, the latter ones may have ostracod and bivalve shells or fish scales and sometimes bear the sings of short-term shallowing and drying. The bulk geochemical analysis of siliciclastics has revealed a high degree of weathering (chemical index of alternation, CIA similar to 72-79) of both types of mudstones, as well as their source rocks (Permian red beds of the Cis-Ural plains). Massive mudstones have non-erosional contacts, they are confined to the regressive stages of sedimentary cycles, and their composition is dominated by fine and medium silt with angular grains. In the geochemical profile of paleosols developed on massive mudstones, under almost constant CIA values, there have been found levels with the high Ti/Zr ratio, which corresponds to the bimodal distribution of grain size. This could be an evidence of an input of clastic material during the pedogenesis process, and the surface morphology of quartz grains indicates their aeolian origin. The study of the paleosol profiles widely represented in the section has allowed reconstruction of the semi-arid climate with distinct rainfall seasonality. The clastic material has been transferred into the Urzhumian sedimentary basin from the Cis-Ural plains by the fluvial way under the semi-arid climate conditions, thereby leading to the formation of laminated mudstones in shallow lakes with periodical drying and on floodplains. An increase of the aeolian silt transport occurred in dry seasons during the stages of lake regressions, when the fluvial plains prograded basinwards simultaneously with the formation of soil cover.

In the present paper we study the succession of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the semi-arid Mediterranean Nabhana reservoir (Central Tunisia) and its relationships with environmental factors during the period from May 2005 to January 2006 in the deepest area of this oligo-mesotrophic reservoir. Water temperature was a keystone factors in the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community throughout the study year 2005-2006 (94-99%) and Microcystis aeruginosa contributed for 93% of the total cyanobacteria abundance. The zooplankton community was dominated by copepods (66%) and cladocerans (28%). The dominant species was Copidodiaptomus numidicus (66% of total zooplankton) followed by Diaphanosoma brachyurum (22% of the total zooplankton). In addition, our results showed that the peak of phytoplankton abundance (5.6 x10(6) cells l(-1), June) coincided with that of zooplankton abundance (2.1 x10(2) ind l(-1), June) contrary to the clear-water phase model. The cyanobacteria and copepods were responsible for these exceptional peaks that occurred in June, accounting respectively for 99% of the total phytoplankton and 82% of the total zooplankton. In the Nabhana reservoir, the trophic relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton were implicated in the phytoplankton abundance and dynamics. The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms is determined by biotic and abiotic factors. The dynamics between cyanobacteria and their grazers may emerge as a regulator of blooms.

We first define the basic reproduction number for the model system, and then show that the trivial periodic state is globally asymptotically stable, and algae is washed out eventually if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, while there exists at least one positive periodic state and algal blooms occur when it is greater than unity. There are several types of productions for dissolved toxins, related to the algal growth rate, and nutrient limitation, respectively. For the system with a specific toxin production, the global attractivity of positive periodic steady-state solution can be established. Numerical simulations from the basic reproduction number show that the factor of seasonality plays an important role in the persistence of harmful algae.

J	Zhu, BQ; Yu, JJ; Rioual, P				Zhu, Bingqi; Yu, Jingjie; Rioual, Patrick			Geochemical Signature of Natural Water Recharge in the Jungar Basin and Its Response to Climate	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This paper analyzed the physico-chemical characteristics of natural waters in a drainage system of the Jungar Basin, northwestern China to identify chemical evolution and recharge mechanisms of natural waters in an arid environment. The waters studied are different in mineralization, but are typically carbonate rivers and alkaline in nature. No Cl-dominated water type occurs, indicating an early stage of water evolution. Regolith and geomorphological parameters controlling ground-surface temperature may play a large role in the geological evolution of the water. Three main morphological and hydrological units are reflected in water physico-chemistry. Climate influences the salinization of natural waters substantially. Direct recharge from seasonal snow and ice-melt water and infiltration of rain to the ground are significant recharge processes for natural waters, but recharge from potential deep groundwater may be less important. The enrichment of ions in lakes has been mainly caused by evaporation rather than through the quality change of the recharged water.

An exploratory GIS-based method to identify and characterise landscapes with an elevated epidemiological risk of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Background: Specific land cover types and activities have been correlated with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense distributions, indicating the importance of landscape for epidemiological risk. However, methods proposed to identify specific areas with elevated epidemiological risk (i.e. where transmission is more likely to occur) tend to be costly and time consuming. This paper proposes an exploratory spatial analysis using geo-referenced human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) cases and matched controls from Serere hospital, Uganda (December 1998 to November 2002) to identify areas with an elevated epidemiological risk of HAT. Methods: Buffers 3 km from each case and control were used to represent areas in which village inhabitants would carry out their daily activities. It was hypothesised that the selection of areas where several case village buffers overlapped would enable the identification of locations with increased risk of HAT transmission, as these areas were more likely to be frequented by HAT cases in several surrounding villages. The landscape within these overlap areas should more closely relate to the environment in which transmission occurs as opposed to using the full buffer areas. The analysis was carried out for each of four annual periods, for both cases and controls, using a series of threshold values (number of overlapping buffers), including a threshold of one, which represented the benchmark (e. g. use of the full buffer area as opposed to the overlap areas). Results: A greater proportion of the overlap areas for cases consisted of seasonally flooding grassland and lake fringe swamp, than the control overlap areas, correlating well with the preferred habitat of the predominant tsetse species within the study area (Glossina fuscipes fuscipes). The use of overlap areas also resulted in a greater difference between case and control landscapes, when compared with the benchmark (using the full buffer area). Conclusions: These results indicate that the overlap analysis has enabled the selection of areas more likely to represent epidemiological risk zones than similar analyses using full buffer areas. The identification of potential epidemiological risk zones using this method requires fewer data than other proposed methods and further development may provide vital information for the targeting of control measures.					; Atkinson, Peter/JOZ-0803-2023; Wardrop, Nicola/C-3031-2012; Atkinson, Peter/L-9508-2013	Fevre, Eric/0000-0001-8931-4986; Atkinson, Peter/0000-0002-5489-6880; Welburn, Susan/0000-0002-9903-7086; Wardrop, Nicola/0000-0001-7401-4841													1471-2334					NOV 21	2012	12								316	10.1186/1471-2334-12-316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-316								23171150					WOS:000312376500001

Amphidromous fishes spawn in rivers, and hatched larvae descend to the sea (or standing water body such as lakes) immediately after hatching, grow there typically for a few months, and then ascend rivers as small juveniles. Landlocked populations of amphidromous fishes above dams and their migration between dam reservoirs and inlet streams (landlocked migration) have often been reported. In these cases, population density in the inlet streams may be increased by dam reservoirs, owing to reduced migration distance, which results in higher return rates. On the other hand, dams without reservoirs do not promote landlocked migration and merely act as a barrier to their upstream migration, resulting in decreased population density. In this study, we examined such contrasting effects of dams with and without reservoirs on the population density of an amphidromous goby, Rhinogobius fluviatilis, in two river systems (the Shigenobu and Yoshino Rivers) of Shikoku Island, Japan. In the Shigenobu River, where more than 300 sediment-control dams and weirs (barriers without reservoirs) have been installed, our analysis showed that the goby density decreased sharply with increasing the number of barriers higher than or equal to 2m. On the other hand, in the Yoshino River, where we investigated both landlocked populations above water storage dams (with reservoirs) and non-landlocked populations in tributaries without water storage dams, the analysis showed that the goby density increased with decreasing the distance from standing water body (i.e. the sea or dam reservoirs). Furthermore, monthly surveys at sites above and below a water storage dam showed that the recruitment of ascending juveniles above the dam was more abundant and seasonally earlier than that below the dam, probably owing to reduced migration distance and increased return rates. Our results have implications for understanding how dams alter natural distribution patterns of amphidromous fishes.

This study develops a method for evaluating the comprehensive impacts of water transfer projects on regional development. In the qualitative assessment, the comprehensive index method is employed, and an evaluation index system is established from economic, social and environmental perspectives. In this approach, the weights are determined by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy combined method. In the quantitative assessment, the sharing coefficient method is used. The procedure is applied to the water transfer project from the Yangtze River to the Taihu Lake. The qualitative results indicate that the conclusion of the water transfer project had a 'large positive impact' in 2016. In the quantitative assessment, the comprehensive benefit of increasing water supply via the project was 1.87 billion CNY in 2016. In addition, the integrated impact assessment method can be implemented at the seasonal scale to produce refined results. These results show that the proposed method can provide technical support for project operation and policy formulation.

Alarming waterweeds proliferation in the Vembanad Lake System might significantly increase water loss through transpiration	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Eichhornia crassipes and Monochoria vaginalis are waterweeds, and their uncontrolled proliferation in fresh and brackish water habitats is a serious ecological problem in many parts of the world. These weeds are quite common in the Vembanad Lake System (VLS), India's second-largest Ramsar wetland. During the non-monsoon season, the Thannermukkom saltwater barrage divides the VLS into two zones: saline water downstream and freshwater upstream. The field sampling of the current study was carried out in the upstream zone of the VLS during the Pre-Monsoon (March 2017). Fresh Eichhornia and Monochoria samples were collected, transported to the lab, and experiments were conducted under natural light conditions to determine how much extra water they transpire into the atmosphere. The results showed that the water loss in experimental tanks with Eichhornia (evapotranspiration) is roughly twice that in control tanks without them (only evaporation). Monochoria transpires fairly more water to the atmosphere than Eichhornia. These results reveal that the proliferation of waterweeds has a significant adverse effect in conserving water in all freshwater bodies infested with them. The current study also points out that the expansion of waterweeds has the potential to worsen drought conditions as they cause excess water loss into the atmosphere and a faster drying up of freshwater reservoirs. Two possible approaches for managing the waterweeds in the VLS include reducing nutrient loading upstream and more frequent opening of the Thannermukkom saltwater barrage to allow saltwater intrusion, which could inhibit the growing waterweeds.

Predictive models are efficient approaches for anticipating eutrophication or algal blooms because ecologists and environmentalists can estimate water pollution levels and take appropriate precautionary steps ahead of time. In aquatic ecosystems, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) can be employed as a water quality indicator, revealing information on man-made physical, chemical, and biological changes variations or seasonal interventions. In the present study, a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was developed to forecast monthly Chl-a concentrations in the North Lagoon of Tunis, a Ramsar site, and one of the most important lagoons in Tunisia, using approximately three decades of historical data, starting from January 1989 to April 2018. SARIMA (2,0,2)(2,0,2)(12) was found to be the best-fitting model for Chl-a forecasting in the North Lagoon of Tunis. The resulting SARIMA model was validated with actual monthly Chl-a concentrations from our last observations. Furthermore, with only one input variable, the SARIMA model showed greater applicability as a eutrophication early warning system using actual past Chl-a data. Finally, the SARIMA model was utilized to anticipate Chl-a levels from May 2018 to December 2025 as an early warning system for ecosystem managers and decision-makers for next generations.																			1400-0350	1874-7841				APR	2022	26	2							10	10.1007/s11852-022-00858-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-022-00858-3													WOS:000776190300002
J	Du, YX; Song, KS; Liu, G				Du, Yunxia; Song, Kaishan; Liu, Ge			Monitoring Optical Variability in Complex Inland Waters Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data	REMOTE SENSING												Optical classification for water bodies was carried out based on satellite remote sensing data, which avoided the limitation of having a limited amount of in situ measured spectral data. Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed on 53,815 reflectance spectra extracted at 500-m intervals based on the same season or quasi-same season Landsat 8 SR data using the algorithm of fuzzy c-means. Lakes and reservoirs in the study area were comprehensively identified as three optical types representing different limnological features. The shape and amplitude characteristics of the reflectance spectra for the three optical water types indicated that one corresponds to the clearest water, one corresponds to turbid water, and the other is moderate clear water. The novelty detection technique was further used to label the match-ups of the in situ data set collected during 2006 to 2019 in 12 field surveys based on mathematical rules of the three optical water types. The results confirmed that each optical water type was associated with different bio-optical properties, and the total suspended matter of the clearest, moderate clear and turbid water types were 14.99 mg/L, 41.06 mg/L and 83.81 mg/L, respectively. Overall, the clearest, moderate clear and turbid waters in the study area accounted for 49.3%, 36.7% and 14.0%, respectively. The spatial distribution of optical water types in the study area was seamlessly mapped. Results showed that the bio-optical conditions of the water distributed across the southeast region were roughly homogeneous, but in most of other regions and within some water bodies, they showed a patchy distribution and heterogeneity. This study is useful for monitoring water quality and provides a useful foundation to develop or tuning algorithms to retrieve water quality parameters.																				2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1910	10.3390/rs14081910	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081910													WOS:000787400200001

Moss bags were used to enrich PTEs from atmospheric deposition, and eight monitoring sites that best represented geographic variation were established around Caohai Lake. Moss bags were collected and examined at every 3 months to identify spatiotemporal patterns of dry and wet atmospheric deposition of PTEs. Zn was the most abundant metal identified from deposition in Caohai (72.07%-95.94%), followed by Pb and Cd, while Hg was the least abundant (0.008%-0.354%). The contributions of wet deposition of PTEs were greater than those of dry deposition, and deposition during the heating season from December to April was greater than that between April to July. Hg was mainly derived from atmospheric dry deposition (65.38%-84.44%). Spatial distribution analysis indicated that atmospheric deposition was associated with the intensity of human activities and heating emissions. Exposure via hand-to-mouth contact accounted for over 99% of the total exposure risk although overall exposure was lower than threshold acceptable levels for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic metals, indicating an overall lack of risk towards human health. Nevertheless, the health risk from atmospheric deposition of PTEs in Caohai Lake may be reduced by focusing on Zn, Pb, and Cd deposition in rainfall and minimizing the hazards associated with hand-to-mouth exposure to PTEs.

Assessment of shoreline restoration using macroinvertebrates in a Great Lakes Area of Concern	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Macroinvertebrate community assemblages were examined in three areas of the littoral zone of an impacted, drowned river mouth lake in west Michigan, USA. Muskegon Lake has an extensive history of environmental abuse, resulting in its listing as a Great Lakes Area of Concern. A multi-organizational, shoreline restoration initiative was started in 2009 and completed in 2012. Despite pre- and post-restoration monitoring of water quality, fish assemblages, and macrophytes, no studies had examined the shifts in the littoral zone macroinvertebrate community. Using Hester-Dendy samplers, we collected macroinvertebrates monthly in submergent, emergent, and open macrophyte zones, at two restored sites and one reference site from August 2018 to October 2019. No pre-restoration samples were collected at these sites but we could examine the changes in restored vs. reference sites. In total, 22,931 individuals were observed, with Gammarus spp., Echinogammarus spp., Chironominae, and Dreissena polymorpha being among the most abundant taxa. NMDS results revealed overlap among macroinvertebrate communities between the two restored sites and separation from the reference site, with some overlapping seasonal differences and communities influenced by macrophyte habitat type. Principal components analysis revealed that the environmental factors were strongly influenced by seasonal changes and drove habitat-level differences, rather than spatial variations among sites. Our results indicate that although the macroinvertebrate community composition at the restored sites differed from that at the reference site, the macroinvertebrate assemblage at each site was dominated by tolerant generalist species. Pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa may have been reduced or eliminated in the lake due to decades of environmental abuse. Periodic monitoring is recommended to determine if these sensitive taxa return, as Muskegon Lake conditions continue to improve.

Dynamics of Higher Aquatic Vegetation of Protected Shallow Water in Relation to Water-Level Regime in the Volga Reach of the Rybinsk Reservoir	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Changes in the higher aquatic vegetation (HAV) of the protected shallow water "Krasnyi Ruchei" from 1989 to 2019 have been analyzed based on aerial imageries, multidate satellite images, and direct field studies. Images from the second half of July to late September are used to study of the overgrowing. An inverse relationship has been found between the degree of overgrowing and water level. The degree of overgrowing of the shallow water is highest (82-86%) at low values of the water level (99.6-99.7 m) and slightly lower (63-78.8%) at higher values (100.3-100.7 m). This is inconsistent with the data on the Rybinsk Reservoir published before 2013; therefore, further research based on a more representative material is required. The specificity of the regulation of the Rybinsk Reservoir water level, as well as the predominant shallow water phase during the freeze-up period and throughout most of the vegetation season and high sedimentation rates, create favorable conditions for the distribution of HAV. By 2019, HAV in the shallow water had spread to a depth of 1.8 m and the area of overgrowing reached 73% of the normal water level. Helophytes occupied about 70% of the optimal shallow water area, while hydrophytes only 20%. Taking into account the high rate of sedimentation and shallowing, the rates of overgrowing of the studied shallow water will be more rapid in the nearest future, which can be controlled by maintaining a water level close to the normal water-surface elevation level of 101.81 m.

The obtained homogenization temperatures (Th) of fluid inclusions range from 6.5 to 49.2 degrees C, with a relative lower Th from transparent halite samples than from gray halite samples. This suggests different temperature conditions and a probable association with seasonal changes. The ion contents of halite fluid inclusions reveal the lake brine is a Na-Mg-K-Ca-Cl type and reached the initial stage of halite deposition. The transparent halite samples plotted within different phase regions than the gray halite samples on plots of ion contents and showed significant change within phase regions. Combined with the observed cm-scale rhythm in the evaporite sequences of the Shulu Sag, these results suggest a shallow water environment and frequent dilution by inflows of fresher water caused by seasonal climate change. The gray halite formed under higher temperatures and increased inflow conditions, and the transparent halite formed under lower temperatures and decreased inflow conditions. Compared with the Jiangling Sag in Hubei Province in southern China, the Shulu Sag may have been less affected by igneous rocks in the Es1 Formation due to the material source, and the concentration of trace elements such as lithium, strontium and boron in the ancient salt lake brine was lower.					; wang, mingquan/HJA-0140-2022	Zhao, Yanjun/0000-0002-1137-9277; 														2075-163X				APR	2022	12	4							410	10.3390/min12040410	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min12040410													WOS:000787419500001
J	Burba, GG; Verma, SB; Kim, J				Burba, GG; Verma, SB; Kim, J			Surface energy fluxes of Phragmites australis in a prairie wetland	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Components of the surface energy balance were measured in three communities (Pragmites australis, Scirpus acutus, and open water) in a wetland located in northcentral Nebraska, USA, during the growing season of 1994. This paper includes results from the area covered by Phragmites australis (reedgrass). The Bowen ratio - energy balance method was used to calculate sensible and latent heat fluxes. During daytime, with a water depth of about 0.5 m, the heat storage term (G) consumed 20-30% of the net radiation (R-n). At night, G was a significant source of energy (on average, about -40 W m(-2)). The magnitude of the daily (24 h) averaged G was small. Evapotranspiration (ET) was a major consumer of the incoming solar energy. During early and peak growth, the daily ET ranged between 2.5 and 6.5 mm per day. During senescence, evapotranspiration was between 0.5 and 3.1 mm per day. ET was partitioned into transpiration (E-v) and evaporation (E-s) using a dual-source modification of the Penman-Monteith equation. Results indicated that transpiration contributed 40-45% of the total ET in the beginning of the early growth stage. During the second half of the early growth stage and the entire peak growth stage, it contributed 53-62% of ET. The contribution decreased to 505 in the beginning of senescence, and to near zero in late senescence. The daytime variation of E-s did not follow R-n, and seemed to be controlled by thermal stability and air dryness. Before senescence, the ratio of the actual to equilibrium evapotranspiration (ET/ETeq) averaged 1.3. It decreased to about 0.5 during senescence. The McNaughton and Spriggs (1989, IAHS Publ. 177, 86-101) model, developed primarily for dryland vegetation significantly overestimated the ET/ETeq ratio in Phragmites when the canopy stomatal resistance was larger than 150 s m(-1). The model prediction improved significantly when the contribution of evaporation was eliminated by substituting the ET/ETeq ratio by E-v/E-veq (transpiration/equilibrium transpiration).

J	Wolfer, SR; Straile, D				Wolfer, SR; Straile, D			Spatio-temporal dynamics and plasticity of clonal architecture in Potamogeton perfoliatus	AQUATIC BOTANY												Above- and below-ground clonal growth architecture was compared for two neighbouring patches of Potamogeton perfoliatus L. in Lake Constance, representing typical sparse and dense growth types. A detailed map of individual ramets and their corresponding rhizome network was produced and the seasonal development of ramet sprouting and rhizome growth was reconstructed. Rhizomes extended at rates ranging between 40 and 63 cm per year, and added a new shoot for every 1-20 cm of rhizome produced. The main rhizome axis grew in a semi-linear fashion, with deviation means of 15 and 24degrees, and developed 0-0.5 branches per plant, with an insertion angle from 15-90degrees. Total rhizome length of all plants amounted to 5 and 11 m m 2 at the two sites. The total biomass produced at the two sites differed by 10-fold. The neighboring patches also showed different allocation patterns which are interpreted as foraging. Contrary to the prediction of the foraging hypothesis, there was only a small difference in mean spacer length between sites. On the other hand, the spacer length was plastic relatively to total biomass. We propose that spacer length is not an independent part of the foraging strategy, but rather a result of overall productivity and biomass allocation. Phosphorus content of plant tissue at the more productive site was two-fold higher than that at the less productive site which suggests that the different growth types may be due to differences in sediment nutrient availability: in situ fertilization of a less productive site increased the P content to those levels of the productive site.

J	Anthony, EJ; Oyédé, LM; Lang, J				Anthony, EJ; Oyédé, LM; Lang, J			Sedimentation in a fluvially infilling, barrier-bound estuary on a wave-dominated, microtidal coast:: the Oueme River estuary, Benin, west Africa	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Oueme River estuary is located on the seasonally humid tropical coast of Benin, west Africa. A striking feature of this microtidal estuary is the presence of a large sand barrier bounding a 120 km(2) circular central basin, Lake Nokoue, that is being infilled by heterogeneous fluvial deposits supplied by a relatively large catchment (50 000 km(2)). Borehole cores from the lower estuary show basal Pleistocene lowstand alluvial sediments overlain by Holocene transgressive-highstand lagoonal mud and by transgressive to probably early highstand tidal inlet and flood-tidal delta sand deposited in association with non-preserved transgressive sand barriers. The change in estuary-mouth sedimentation from a transgressive barrier-inlet system to a regressive highstand barrier reflects regional modifications in marine sand supply and in the cross-barrier tidal flux associated with barrier-inlet systems. As barrier formation west of the Oueme River led to an increasingly rectilinear shoreline, the longshore drift cell matured, ensuring voluminous eastward transport of sand from the Volta Delta in Ghana, the major purveyor of sand, to the Oueme embayment, 200 km east. Concomitantly, the number of tidal inlets, and the tidal flux associated with a hitherto interlinked lagoonal system on this coast, diminished. Complete sealing of Lake Nokoue has produced a large, permanently closed estuary, where tidal intrusion is assured through the interconnected coastal lagoon via an inlet located 60 km east. Since 1885, tides have entered the estuary directly through an artificial outlet cut across the sand barrier. Although precluding the seaward loss of fluvial sediments, permanent estuary-mouth closure has especially deprived the highstand estuary of marine sand, a potentially important component in estuarine infill on wave-dominated coasts. In spite of a significant fluvial sediment supply, estuarine infill has been moderate, because of the size of the central basin. Estuarine closure has resulted in two co-existing highstand sediment suites, with limited admixture, the marine-derived, estuary-mouth barrier and upland-derived back-barrier sediments. This situation differs from that of mature barrier estuaries characterized by active fluvial-marine sediment mixing and facies interfingering.

J	Brandao, ILD; Mannaerts, CM; Saraiva, ACF				Brandao, Isabel Leidiany de Sousa; Mannaerts, Chris M.; Fonseca Saraiva, Augusto Cesar			Seasonal variation of phytoplankton indicates small impacts of anthropic activities in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Knowledge about phytoplankton community structure helps in assessing the quality of a water body. However, variables related to it are not routinely surveyed in most of the water quality monitoring programs. Our approach included studying the diversity of these organisms, in a large tropical reservoir in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve. The research was carried out in the rainy and dry season when measurements were performed every three hours and at five different depths. A total of 40 water samples were collected to analyze temporal variations of abiotic and biotic factors. Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed to characterize the ecosystem and relationships between these variables and phytoplankton functional groups were statistically tested. The data were examined using analysis of variance and canonical correspondence analysis. We identified 9 functional groups in both seasons. The functional group M, which represents organisms with developed adaptations to high insolation and stable environments, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the rainy season. Group P, which tends to be present in the more eutrophic lakes and is tolerant to carbon deficiency, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the dry season. This study indicated that the fluctuations of the water level reflected in seasonal changes of phytoplankton biomass and environmental variables. Additionally, this experiment permitted to advise on sampling strategies for monitoring phytoplankton in lakes and reservoirs.

They are affected by nutrient and light availability and seasonal changes. In this study, we investigated the changes of C/N metabolism and growth of three natural submersed macrophyte populations (i.e., each in a different site), Potamogeton maackianus, in response to water depth gradients with 0.5 m interval in a freshwater lake for four seasons. Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0 m to 5.5 m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3-N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4-N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that: Compared with the dry season, the species and content of PHAs in Liuxi River are fewer in the plentiful season. In the plentiful season, 7 kinds of PHAs were detected, and the total PAHs content ( n-ary sumation PAHs) in each sampling point ranges from 73.2 to 258.5 ng/g. While in the dry season, 13 kinds of PHAs were detected, and the n-ary sumation PAHs ranges from 26.3 to 1701.5 ng/g. To trace the sources of PAHs, the molecular ratio methods, such as LMW/HMW, Fla/(Fla + Pyr) and BaA/(BaA + Chr), were used respectively. In most cases, PAHs in Liuxi Ricer were pyrogenic. These sources included combustion of petroleum fuel, and burning of biomass fuels like coal and wood. The toxicity of fluorene and fluoranthene in Liuxi River was evaluated. The results showed that there was oxidative damage induced by H2O2 at a fluorine concentration of 50 mg/L, and fluoranthene could induce oxidative stress and DNA damage. In addition, the damage stress induced by fluoranthene was stronger than by fluorine under the same concentrations.

Nesting Ecology of Red-breasted Mergansers in a Common Tern Colony in Eastern New Brunswick	WATERBIRDS												Nest-site selection and nest success for Red-breasted Mergansers (Mergus senator) breeding on a barrier island complex (Tern Islands) with >10,000 Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, were studied in 2005 and 2006. Concealment was the most important feature for nest placement as 153 of 156 nests were in dense stands of Marram Grass (Ammophila breviligulata), and overhead concealment, vegetation density and vegetation height were all greater at nests than at random locations. Apparent. success for all nests was 57% and was similar between years. Few nests were depreciated (N = 3), but abandonment was responsible for 95% of nest losses and was most common early in the season. Nest success was <45% for nests initiated before 25 May but >75% for nests initiated after 10 June. Nest. abandonment was influenced by intraspecific nest parasitism and investigator activity. Red-breasted Mergansers selected nest sites adaptively on Tern Islands because: 1) nests were more concealed than random sites; 2) avian predation at nests in the Common Tern colony was lower than at nests on nearby islands without terns; 3) nests were not exposed to mammalian predators; and 4) nest success and nest densities were high.																			1524-4695					JUN	2009	32	2					282	292		10.1675/063.032.0208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.032.0208													WOS:000268266400008

Abundance and bacterial production (BP) of heterotrophic bacteria (HBact) were measured in the north and south basins of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, during seasonal sampling series between 2002 and 2007. The major objective of the study was to assess whether BP can supplement phytoplankton particulate primary production (particulate PP) in the pelagic waters, and whether BP and particulate PP are related in this large lake. HBact were enumerated in the 0-100 m surface layer by epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; BP was quantified using H-3-thymidine incorporation, usually in three mixolimnion layers (0-40, 40-60 and 60-100 m). 2. Flow cytometry allowed three subpopulations to be distinguished: low nucleic acid content bacteria (LNA), high nucleic acid content bacteria (HNA) and Synechococcus-like picocyanobacteria (PCya). The proportion of HNA was on average 67% of total bacterial abundance, and tended to increase with depth. HBact abundance was between 1.2 x 10(5) and 4.8 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), and was maximal in the 0-40 m layer (i.e. roughly, the euphotic layer). Using a single conversion factor of 15 fg C cell(-1), estimated from biovolume measurements, average HBact biomass (integrated over a 100-m water column depth) was 1.89 +/- 1.05 g C m(-2). 3. Significant differences in BP appeared between seasons, especially in the south basin. The range of BP integrated over the 0-100 m layer was 93-735 mg C m(-2) day(-1), and overlapped with the range of particulate PP (150-1687 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) measured in the same period of time at the same sites. 4. Depth-integrated BP was significantly correlated to particulate PP and chlorophyll-a, and BP in the euphotic layer was on average 25% of PP. 5. These results suggest that HBact contribute substantially to the particulate organic carbon available to consumers in Lake Tanganyika, and that BP may be sustained by phytoplankton-derived organic carbon in the pelagic waters.

The aquifer system of DoA +/- ana (southwest Spain) has been studied over recent decades from a hydrogeological point of view, although nothing is known about its biological or ecological aspects. In order to describe the general characteristics of its microbial communities, bacterial abundance, cell biomass, bacterial biomass and microbial activities of functional groups were investigated by sampling, over a 2-year period, 13 wells located in the vicinity of four very productive shallow lakes in the most superficial part of this coastal, sandy aquifer system. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated differences in abundance and biomass variables among sampling locations, seasons and sampling locations x seasons. Principal component analysis showed that temperature and dissolved oxygen appeared to be the most important factors controlling the temporal variability of microbial communities. Hydrological connectivity between surface water and groundwater was important in the control of the spatiotemporal distribution of microbial communities. Due to this hydrological connection, the aquifer system and the wetlands constitute a unique entity, a unique ecosystem, called the "hydroecosystem", where microbial communities could play a central ecological role.

Associations between watershed characteristics, runoff, and stream water quality: hypothesis development for watershed disturbance experiments and modelling in the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE					12th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering	MAY 16-19, 2004	Edmonton, CANADA					The FORWARD project, based on the Boreal Plain of Alberta, was initiated to develop models to predict the influence of watershed disturbance on runoff and stream water quality. To generate hypotheses relating to watershed controls on streams in the presence and absence of disturbance, we quantified relationships between stream variables and soil distribution in nine undisturbed small (M = 5.4 km(2)) watersheds for two relatively dry and snowmelt-dominated seasons (May through October 2002 and 2003). We also considered data from one harvested and two burned watersheds. Among soil types, only peatland cover had an association with runoff and water quality. Runoff and ammonium exports were positively related to peatland cover in both years (r(2) = 0.50 to 0.90; P < 0.05). In the first year, additional relationships to peatland cover existed for particulate phosphorus and suspended sediment exports (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.65, respectively), whereas in the second year they existed for dissolved phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon exports (r(2) = 0.67 and 0.78, respectively). Hypotheses generated relate to the role of peatlands as sources for water moving toward stream channels, water exchange between streams and riparian groundwater, and the influence of disturbance and precipitation patterns on runoff generation.

Seven mountain lakes lay above the timberline (Ovre Neadalsvatn and Stavsvatn, Norway; Lochnagar, Scotland; Starolesnianske pleso and Nizne Terianske pleso, Slovak Republic; Chuna ozero, Russia; Lago Paione Superiore, Italy) and four acidified lakes (Cerne, Certovo, Plesne and Prasilske jezero, Sumava Mountains, Czech Republic) in the mountain forest. Additionally, thr tropical high latitude Lago de Alchichica (Mexico) was analysed. Ciliate taxons were identified using the quantitative protargol staining approach, and feeding patterns were tentatively detected by using fluorescence microscopy methods. Nano- to microphytoplankton hunters and/ or mixotrophic ciliates prevailed in all acidic lakes. Numbers of ciliates were very low (seasonal lake mean below 200 cells/l) except in two Tatra lakes (to 21000 cells/l). Prostomes of the genera Urotricha, Holophrya and Prorodon dominated in most of the samples, both numerically as well as in biomass (seasonal lake mean from 13.6 to 100 % and 4.6 to 99.7 %, respectively), particularly in acidified water lakes (Starolesnianske, Certovo and Prasilske jezero). Among mixotrophs, oligotrichs of genera Pelagostrombidium and Limnostrombidium were the most prominent (up to 49.9 and 64.6 %, respectively). The picoplankton-feeders (minute oligotrichs, peritrichs and scuticociliates) were found to be an important component even in the oligotrophic environment but this ecological type never dominated within the water column (up to 22.2 and 30.3 %, respectively). Major food sources of gymnostomes, prevailing only in Lochnagar (82.5 and 87.5 %, respectively; Mesodinium sp.), remained unclear; large Askenasia spp. were apparently mixotrophic. Using a cluster analysis, the lakes were grouped according to the total numbers of ciliates and contributions of distinct ecological groups with different feeding patterns. Within low acidic lakes, Lochnagar differed from all others. The rest of the lakes was divided into two subgroups: remote pristine lakes of the Northern transect (the Norwegian lakes and Chuna ozero), and the others, geographically affiliated to the south transect (Pyreneans, Alps, Tatra Mts.). Such a differentiation is in good agreement with the clustering based on chemical parameters reported for the lakes. No marked differences in the ciliate distribution were detected when the above timberline- and forest surrounded mountain lakes were compared.

Environmental factors affecting biomass and distribution of Stuckenia pectinata in the Heron Lake System, Minnesota, USA	WETLANDS												The Heron Lake System historically has been an important resource for waterfowl in Southern Minnesota, USA. In the early 1900s, the system was a major nesting, feeding, and staging area for breeding and migrating waterfowl mainly due to the extensive growth of sago pondweed, Stuckenia pectinata. In recent years, the abundance of S. pectinata has decreased dramatically. We conducted a study from 2002 through 2003 to identify factors limiting the success of S. pectinata. Distribution and biomass of S. pectinata differed significantly over the years of this study. Biomass was related to environmental factors, including water transparency and water temperature early in the season. Water transparency during May (time of early growth) had a negative relationship with maximum biomass at each site over all years. Water temperature had a positive relationship with increases in seasonal biomass yield of S. pectinata in the Heron Lake System.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2006	26	2					313	321		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[313:EFABAD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[313:EFABAD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000238701700004
J	Herb, WR; Stefan, HG				Herb, WR; Stefan, HG			Seasonal growth of submersed macrophytes in lakes: The effects of biomass density and light competition	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The long-term growth and succession of aquatic plant species in lakes have been documented in many field studies, but there has been little insight to quantify the mechanisms which determine the outcome of competitive growth. In this paper, a process-based macrophyte growth model is formulated and used to investigate the light limited growth of individual macrophyte species and of two species in competition. Closed form solutions for integral biomass production over I day are derived, reducing the time and depth resolution required for seasonal growth calculations. For growth in monoculture, seasonal biomass production is found to be most sensitive to the base growth and respiration rate coefficients and the temperature dependence of growth, and relatively insensitive to biomass density, and the half-saturation constant for light. The sensitivity of seasonal biomass production to basic physiological, morphological, and physical lake parameters is found to be significantly higher for growth in competition compared to growth in monoculture. For published growth parameter values, invasive species are predicted to suppress the growth of native species over a well-defined range of water depths and turbidities, largely by reaching the water surface early in the season and subsequently forming a dense surface canopy.

These reflect plant available moisture. and more latterly human impact. The record from Chenevo shows: from 7260 to 6930 C-14 yr BP, open savanna vegetation and gallery forest along the drainage system; from 6930 to 4000 C-14 yr BP, forest and gallery forest expanded from 5500 C-14 yr BP, Mauritia palm forest increased and particularly so from 4000 to 2380 C-14 yr BP also in combination with gallery forest expansion; from 2380 C-14 yr BP to present-day gallery forest, Mauritia and Mauritiella palm forest is most abundant. The from Mozambique is hampered by C-14 reversals, but appears to show the following development: from 3440 to 610 C-14 yr BP abundant Mauritia swamp forests from 600 C-14 yr BP Mauritia swamp forest was replaced by gallery forest in which Byttneria, Mimosa and Sapindaceae are presents from 600 to 350 C-14 yr BP, gallery forest replaced woody grass savanna; during the last 350 C-14 yr BP, savanna increased and gallery forest decreased, as Cecropia, Mauritia and Zea mays point to human impact. Comparison of pollen records from six savanna lakes located along 400 km east-west transect (Sardinas, Angel, El Pinal, Carimagua, Chenevo and Mozambique) shows the following regional vegetation and climate development. From 18000 to 10700 C-14 yr BP, patchy gallery forest, non-permanent lake conditions and maximum abundance of grasses reflect low precipitation and long dry seasons. From 10700 to 9700 C-14 yr BP, gallery forest expansion reflects a more humid climate. From 9700 to 5800 14C yr BP, grasslands were at a maximum, reflecting dry climatic conditions.

A new, mathematically justified methodology for fuzzy inference-total fuzzy similarity-is used and compared with the more traditional Sugeno-style method. Specifically, the seasonal variation in both hydrological variables and operational targets is examined by considering the inputs as season-dependent relative values. instead of using absolute values. The inference drawn in several stages allows a simple, accessible model structure. The control model is illustrated using Lake Paijanne, a regulated lake in Finland. The model is calibrated to simulate the actual operation, but also to better fulfill the new multipurpose operational objectives determined by experts. Relatively similar results obtained with the inference methods and the strong mathematical background of total fuzzy similarity put fuzzy reasoning on a solid foundation.

Results of a macro-fractures analysis	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Grotta di Pozzo is a small cave at 720 m asl and 42 degrees N in the Apennine range of Abruzzo (Central Italy), formerly opening on the edge of a now drained large lake, the Lake Fucino. The archaeological sequence starts on the top of a fluvial-lacustrine deposit at 23,000 cal. BP, with layers including lithic industry of the Early Epigravettian. Later on, from 15,500 cal. BP and up to 14,000 cal. BP, the lithics belong to the Final Epigravettian. Previous zooarchaeological analysis provided evidence of the seasonal hunting of chamois, followed by ibex and red deer, as well as marmot and black grouse, while trout eventually became another important food resource. Here we analyse the lithic industry in order to identify the projectile points using analysis under the microscope coupled with access to a reference collection and with experimental training. We conclude that microlithic backed tools were definitely projectile points, as widely assumed in the case of the Epigravettian but rarely confirmed by focused investigation. Furthermore, use-wears due to hafting suggest that after the Last Glacial Maximum the hunting gear possibly included complex weapons in the mountain environment of the Central Apennine.

Luke			SURVIVAL OF TRANSLOCATED GREATER SAGE-GROUSE HENS IN NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Translocation success of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is generally measured by documenting whether translocated individuals survive and reproduce at the release site. However. demographic parameters, such as annual survival of translocated individuals, provide a more accurate measure of translocation success. We translocated 60 female sage-grouse from Oregon and Nevada to Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge, California, during 2005-2010 to augment a small population of resident grouse. We radio-marked each translocated female and a sample of resident female sage-grouse, recorded their locations, and monitored their survival at monthly intervals over the study period. We observed most (55/60) translocated birds near (<100 m from) the only lek in the study area within one week of their release, To examine factors influencing survival, we developed a set of a priori models that included the effects of translocation status, season (breeding vs. nonbreeding), year, and age on annual survival and compared the models AlCc values using program MARK. The null model was the best supported model and received 335 of the model weight. Models that included survival during the first year posttranslocation, age, and season, however, were competitive (<2 Delta AlCc) with the top model. However, the 1 coefficient distinguishing breeding from nonbreeding season survival was the only coefficient whose 95% confidence interval did not overlap zero; monthly survival during the breeding season (0.952 +/- 0.014) was lower than during the nonbreeding season (0.960 +/- 0.008). The model average estimate of annual survival for female sage-grouse in our study area was 59.6% (95% CI 47.9-70.1). Our analyses provide little support for a difference in survival between translocated and resident sage-grouse, :mud our annual survival estimates were comparable to annual survival estimates of resident sage-grouse in other locations. Our results suggest that when current recommendations for translocation protocols are followed, translocated female sage-grouse survive just as well as resident individuals and quickly integrate into the local population.

J	Outcalt, KW; Wade, DD				Outcalt, KW; Wade, DD			Fuels management reduces tree mortality from wildfires in southeastern United States	SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY												The objective was to determine the effectiveness of a regular prescribed burning program for reducing tree mortality in southern pine forests burned by wildfire. This study was conducted on public and industry lands in northeast Florida. On the Osceola National Forest, mean mortality was 35% in natural stands and 43% in plantations two growing seasons after a June 1998 wildfire. Burn history significantly affected mortality with those stands prescribe-burned 1.5 yr prior to the wildfire having the lowest mortality, while stands prescribe-burned 2 or more years prior had higher mortality. Although significant tree mortality did occur on the Osceola National Forest, with all trees killed in some stands, many trees in other burned stands did survive. The overall mortality was lower in both plantations and natural stands on the Osceola than at Tiger Bay where prescribed burning had been less frequent. The highest mortality rates occurred on the Lake Butler Forest where prescribed burning had not been used since plantation establishment. Thus, a regular prescribed burning program will reduce mortality following wildfires in both natural and planted stands of southern pines on flat woods sites, even when wildfires occur under severe drought conditions.																			0148-4419					FEB	2004	28	1					28	34		10.1093/sjaf/28.1.28	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sjaf/28.1.28													WOS:000189036200004

Match-Mismatch Regulation for Bluegill and Yellow Perch Larvae and Their Prey in Sandhill Lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Food availability may regulate fish recruitment, both directly and indirectly. The availability of zooplankton, especially to newly hatched larvae, is thought to be crucial to their early growth and survival. We examined stomach contents of larval bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and yellow perch Perca flavescens in Pelican Lake and Cameron Lake, Nebraska, in 2004 and 2005. We also determined zooplankton availability and calculated prey selection using Chesson's alpha. In addition, we investigated potential match-mismatch regulation of recruitment from 2004 to 2008. Bluegill positively selected copepod nauplii and Bosmina spp., and yellow perch often selected copepods. Abundant zooplankton populations were available for consumption. Matches of both larval bluegill and yellow perch abundance to zooplankton abundance were detected in all years; exact matches were common. Mismatches in predator and prey production were not observed. Predation by age-0 yellow perch on age-0 bluegill was not observed, even though yellow perch hatched 2 mo prior to bluegill. Given that zooplankton were abundant and well-timed to larval fish relative abundance over the time span of this study, the match-mismatch hypothesis alone may not fully account for observed recruitment variability in these populations. Environmental conditions may also affect recruitment and warrant further investigation.

J	Komárková, J; Tavera, R				Komárková, J; Tavera, R			Steady state of phytoplankton assemblage in the tropical Lake Catemaco (Mexico)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton of the tropical lake Catemaco (Veracruz, Mexico) showed similar species composition during samplings from 1993 to 1995. There were two small dominant cyanobacterial species Cylindrospermopsis catemaco Kom.-Legn. et Tavera and Cylindrospermopsis philippinensis (Taylor) Kom., and a group of larger algae and cyanobacteria that were always present, however in smaller numbers: Aulacoseira granulata (Ehr.) Simons morphotype curvata, A. cf. italica (Ehr.) Simons mf. curvata, Fragilaria construens (Her.) Grun., Achnanthes minutissima Kutz., Planktolyngbya circumcreta (G.S. West) Anagn. et Kom., Chroococcus microscopicus Kom.-Legn. et Cronberg. Moreover we found several other scarcely present species. The percentage of total biomass of the two dominant species of Cylindrospermopsis varied between 34 and 81%, but they accounted for 80 to 95% of abundance. Apart from geomorphological features and climate conditions, biological variables played an important role. Fish-stock was formed by filter-feeding native herbivorous species of fish Dorosoma petenense (Gunther), Bramocharax caballeroi (Contreras et Rivera), Astyanax mexicanus (Filippi), and an introduced, also herbivore Oreochromis niloticus (L.). Feeding activity of fish removed large species of algae and cyanobacteria as well as detrital remnants and zooplankton from the water. Smaller, inedible cyanobacteria remained in the water and formed the stable portion of the phytoplankton, dominant both in biomass and abundance. CANOCO analysis of samples and species variability demonstrated results of competition between two species of Cylindrospermopsis: steady state during the dominance of C. catemaco lasting probably for the whole year 1993 (one dry and one wet season) and steady state during the dominance of C. philippinensis in 1994 and 1995. According to the functional classification of phytoplankton suggested by Reynolds et al. (2002), Catemaco dominant assemblage would belong to the functional group S-N.

J	Hoffman, AL; Forest, CE; Li, W				Hoffman, Alexis L.; Forest, Chris E.; Li, Wei			Estimating the sensitivity of regional dust sources to sea surface temperature patterns	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Exploring the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly patterns on local climate in major dust source regions helps clarify our understanding of variability in the global dust cycle. In contrast to previous work, this research focuses explicitly on the influence of SST anomalies on dust emissions and attempts to explain the mechanisms by which SST anomalies affect seasonal dust emissions. This study investigates the seasonal sensitivity of mineral aerosol emissions to SST anomaly patterns from the Bodele Depression, West Africa, Sahel, Kalahari Desert, Arabian Desert, and Lake Eyre basin. The global teleconnection operator, which relates regional climate responses to SST anomaly patterns, is estimated for relevant variables in an ensemble of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 forced by randomly perturbed climatological SST fields. Variability in dust emissions from major dust sources is linked to tropical SST anomalies, particularly in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Teleconnections excited by remote SST anomalies typically impact dust emissions via changes in near-surface wind speeds and friction velocity. However, SST-driven impacts on the threshold friction velocity can be of the same order of magnitude as changes in the friction velocity, suggesting the impact of SST anomalies on precipitation and soil moisture is also significant. Identifying SST anomaly patterns as a component of internal variability in regional dust emissions helps characterize human influences on the dust cycle as well as improve predictions of climate, nutrient cycles, and human environments.

Analysis of vegetation, small mammals, amphibians, and songbirds	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We compared vegetation structure, flora, and fauna in forest stands at varying distances from small lakes in the boreal mixedwood zone of Alta., Canada, with that in the surrounding upland landscape. We tested the hypothesis that lakeside riparian forest is more structurally diverse, hosts different biotic communities, and has greater floral diversity and greater abundance and richness of other biota, as compared with similar forest in areas far from open water. Lakeside forest was characterized by greater canopy cover, and aspen height and diameter (breast height) than upland forest, but absolute differences were quite small and there was no evidence of greater structural diversity. Contrary to expectations, herb richness and diversity were lower in lakeside forests and the understory community there could not be differentiated from that of upland forests. Two species of anuran amphibians [wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and boreal toad (Bufo boreas boreas)] were more abundant in forest up to 100 m from lakes than in upland areas 400-1200 m away from open water. However, differences in abundance between trapping sites in the non-forested riparian zone and sites up to 100 m into the lakeside forest were small. Use of upland habitats by amphibians (juvenile wood frog in particular) was substantial during the latter part of their active season, possibly because they used upland areas for dispersal and overwintering. The two most abundant species of small mammal [red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)] were trapped less often in the non-forested riparian zone, while the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonicus), and shrews (Sorex spp.) were more abundant in those areas. Abundance did not differ significantly among trap lines located in forest from 50 m to > 600 m from open water. Songbird abundance and richness were higher near lakes, possibly because of the additional niches available at the forest/lake interface and increased food supply for insectivorous birds. Overall, our results did not strongly support our hypotheses concerning the ecological attributes of lakeside riparian forest. If any part of these lakeside riparian areas can be considered ecologically unique or species-rich it appears to be the nonforested riparian zone and, for birds, the natural lakeshore ecotone (similar to 50 m into the forest). We encourage those responsible for forest management to re-think prescriptive placement of fixed-width forested buffers around all lakes, and instead consider a landscape-scale planning approach that determines the appropriate placement of uncut forest on the landscape to meet broad conservation objectives.

It is a terminal moraine, monomictic, acidic lake that is typically oligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic. The current situation of the lake was assessed using phytoplankton data from the growing seasons of 2013. In addition, data from the 1980s were used to evaluate any variation from former conditions. The planktonic communities were analyzed using biomass measurements (Chlorophyll-a and biovolume) and several composition metrics (IGA, PTSI, PTI and IGA2). Considering the applicable Spanish legislation for ecological quality assessment, the ecological status in 2013 was High. According to both the biomass and composition metrics, no change in the trophic status was apparent, although there was some evidence of a shift in species contribution to biomass from the 1980s samples to the current ones. The shift from cyanobacterial taxa to diatoms was one of the changes observed, but this does not necessarily imply a change in the trophic status.

This study employed stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) for Coilia nasus from the lower Yangtze River and the adjacent East China Sea to distinguish different ecotypic groups, ascertain trophic nutrition positions, and reflect environmental influences on C. nasus. delta C-13 signatures of C. nasus sampled from Zhoushan (ZS), Chongming (CM), and Jingjiang (JJ) waters were significantly higher than those from the Poyang Lake (PYL) (P < 0.05). By contrast, delta N-15 signatures of C. nasus in ZS, CM, and JJ groups were significantly lower than those in PYL group (P < 0.05). Basing on delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures, we could distinguish anadromous (ZS, CM, and JJ) and non-anadromous (PYL) groups. The trophic level (TL) of anadromous C. nasus ranged from 2.90 to 3.04, whereas that of non-anadromous C. nasus was 4.38. C. nasus occupied the middle and top nutrition positions in the marine and Poyang Lake food webs, respectively. C. nasus in Poyang Lake were significantly more enriched in delta N-15 but depleted in delta C-13, suggesting that anthropogenic nutrient inputs and terrigenous organic carbon are important to the Poyang Lake food web. This study is the first to apply delta N-15 and delta C-13 to population assignment studies of C. nasus in the Yangtze River and its affiliated waters. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) is shown to be a useful tool for discriminating anadromous and non-anadromous C. nasus.																			1672-5182	1993-5021				DEC	2015	14	6					1053	1058		10.1007/s11802-015-2611-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11802-015-2611-3													WOS:000364572000016
J	Timms, BV				Timms, Brian V.			The biology of the saline lakes of central and eastern inland of Australia: a review with special reference to their biogeographical affinities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In 1984 when Bill Williams highlighted the regionalization of salt lakes in Australia, little was known about lakes in the remote inland. It was thought the invertebrate fauna of such lakes was depauperate due to their being poor evolutionary loci associated with extreme episodicity. However, work in the last two decades, has shown the fauna of many inland lakes is relatively rich. Part of the reason for restricted faunas in the larger lakes is habitat homeogeneity. Nevertheless there is little diversification at the species level, indicating restrictions on speciation. There are also limits on diversity imposed by the harsh environment, as indicated by the lack of forms unable to survive severe desiccation, e.g. higher crustaceans. Lakes in central and the eastern inland are dominated by characteristic lower crustaceans such as Parartemia minuta, Daphniopsis queenslandensis, Moina baylyi, Trigonocypris globulosa and a new mytilocyprid ostracod, as well as some forms widespread in Australia and in salt lakes on other continents. This invertebrate fauna is just as distinct as those of other salt lake districts in southern Australia, further reinforcing the concept of regionalization in Australia. The fish fauna of central and eastern salt lakes is also largely specific, but the waterbirds are not as they have responded to the episodicity by nomadism and habitat flexibility.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2007	576						27	37		10.1007/s10750-006-0290-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0290-1													WOS:000243089500004
J	Bergan, T; Rodhe, H				Bergan, T; Rodhe, H			Oxidation of elemental mercury in the atmosphere; Constraints imposed by global scale modelling	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												We use the global mercury model published by Bergan et al. (1999) to evaluate the potential role of ozone and the hydroxyl radical as gas phase oxidants for the oxidation of elemental mercury in the atmosphere. The magnitude of natural and man-made mercury emissions are taken from recent literature estimates. We consider only two mercury reservoirs, elemental mercury, Hg-0, and the more soluble divalent form, HgII. Wet and dry deposition of HgII is explicitly treated. Applying monthly mean fields of ozone for the oxidation of gas phase Hg-0 and using the reaction rate by Hall (1995) yields a global transformation of Hg-0 to HgII which is too slow to keep the simulated concentration of Hg-0 near observed values. This shows that there must be additional important removal processes for Hg-0 or that the reaction rate proposed by Hall (1995) is too slow. A simulation in which the oxidation rate was artificially increased, so that the global turn-over time of Hg-0 is one year and the simulated average concentration of Hg-0 realistic, produces latitudinal and seasonal variations in Hg-0 that do not support the hypothesis that gas phase reaction with O-3 is the major oxidation process for Hg-0. Recent studies indicate that OH may be an important gas phase oxidant for Hg-0 (Sommar et al., 2001). Using OH as the sole oxidant and applying the oxidation rate by Sommar et al., we calculate a concentration of Hg-0 well below (about a factor of three) the observations. By prescribing a slower rate, corresponding to a turn-over time of Hg-0 of one year, we calculate concentrations of both Hg-0 in surface air and HgII in precipitation which correspond reasonably well, both in magnitude and temporal variation, with seasonal observations in Europe and North America. This result supports the suggestion that the oxidation by OH is an important pathway for the removal of Hg-0. In view of the uncertainties associated with our calculations, this conclusion should still be regarded as tentative.																			0167-7764	1573-0662				OCT	2001	40	2					191	212		10.1023/A:1011929927896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011929927896													WOS:000171145600004

We explored seasonal variation of C gas production by simulations of the anaerobic decomposition of Utricularia breviscapa within the sediment of a tropical aquatic system, using a bioassay response, within the context of carbon cycling. We incubated U. breviscapa detritus in lake water from A"leo Lagoon, Brazil, and measured rates of CO2 and CH4 production over 138 days at four distinct temperatures simulating seasonal conditions of the lagoon from which the plant was collected. Periodically, subsamples of gases contained in the headspace of the decomposition chambers were collected, and the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 were quantified by gas chromatography. Methane production was limited at temperatures below 20 A degrees C. Higher temperatures favored formation of CO2, while CH4 was a secondary product. The CO2 from the anaerobic metabolism of the sediment was the dominant final product. Based on the responses from the bioassays simulating the anaerobic decomposition of the prevalent U. breviscapa, we conclude that in the cooler (< 20 A degrees C) season (June and July), CH4 production is limited, and that year-round dominant mineralization product is CO2. Our warmer incubations (i.e., > 20 A degrees C temperatures) indicate that CO2 and CH4 productions are both favored during warmer seasons, but CH4 appears with a delayed response. Within the range of temperatures of this tropical environment, biogenic C gas emissions from anaerobic degradation processes in sediments contribute strongly to the accumulation of C gas through carbon dynamics.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				SEP	2013	13	8					1461	1468		10.1007/s11368-013-0735-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0735-x													WOS:000323251600014
J	Hoyos, R; Urrego, LE; Lema, A				Hoyos G., Rossalyn; Estela Urrego G., Ligia; Lema T., Alvaro			Natural regeneration response in mangroves of the Gulf of Uraba (Colombia) to the environmental and intra-annual climate variability	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The natural regeneration process allows the mangrove forests remain over time. Both, biological and physical factors can affect the establishment and early stages along the development of trees. This study examined the response of natural regeneration of mangroves in the Turbo River delta and El Uno bay (Uraba Gulf, Colombia) to intra-annual environmental variability. We quantified mortality, survival and recruitment of seedlings of three mangrove species, seasonally during one year, in 72 semi-permanent sub-plots of 1m(2). In the sub-plots, the total height and the diameter at the base of the stem of all mangrove seedlings with basal diameter less than 2.5cm were measured. Damage by herbivores was also recorded to each seedling. While Laguncularia racemosa recorded the highest rates of mortality, Rhizophora mangle showed the highest survival rate during the study period, although Avicennia germinans dominated the natural regeneration. Through a Redundancy Analysis these processes were associated to environmental variables such as: Direct Site Factor-DSF (sunlight), sediments input rate, herbivory, distances from mangroves to the river, to inner lakes, and to the coastline. These variables explained 43% of the natural regeneration variation; sedimentation rate was the most important variable, while light was very representative for the R. mangle survival. Based on historical records of precipitation, Turbo River flow rate and associated sediment loads, it was established that during the highest precipitation peak, the survival of all species decreases and during the dry season, when the conditions of flooding and sediments input were lower, it was improved. The results indicated that the sediments input rates and sunlight play an important role in the survival of natural regeneration of evaluated mangrove species.

Brian			Analysis of arsenic speciation in mine contaminated lacustrine sediment using selective sequential extraction, HR-ICPMS and TEM	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In order to determine how As speciation in lacustrine sediment changes as a function of local conditions, sediment cores were taken from three fakes with differing hydrologic regimes and subjected to extensive chemical and TEM analysis. The lakes (Killarney, Thompson and Swan Lakes) are located within the Coeur d'Alene River system (northern Idaho, USA), which has been contaminated with trace metals and As, from over 100 a of sulfide mining. Previous analyses of these lakebed sediments have shown an extensive amount of contaminant metals and As associated with sub-pm, grains, making them extremely difficult to analyze using standard methods (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction). Transmission electron microscopy offers great advantages in spatial resolution and can be invaluable in determining As speciation when combined with other techniques. Data indicate that because of differences in local redox conditions, As speciation and stability is dramatically different in these lakes. Killarney and Thompson Lakes experience seasonal water-level fluctuations due to drawdown on a downstream dam, causing changes in O-2 content in sediment exposed during drawdown. Swan Lake has relatively constant water levels as its only inlet is dammed. Consequently, Killarney and Thompson Lakes show an increase in labile As-bearing phases with depth, while Swan Lake data indicate stable As hosts throughout the sediment profile. Based on these observations it can be stated that As in lakebed sediments is much less mobile, and therefore less bioavailable, when water is kept at a constant level.

J	Vidal, J; Casamitjana, X				Vidal, Javier; Casamitjana, Xavier			Forced resonant oscillations as a response to periodic winds in a stratified reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE												The response of the Sau reservoir to a wind field characterized by having marked periodicities of 12 h and 24 h has been studied. Measurements of temperature, with a thermistor string, and currents, with an acoustic Doppler current meter, show that the reservoir also responds with the same water periodicities. During certain times of the stratified period, some of the natural oscillation modes of the reservoir are close to these forcing wind periods. In particular, in mid-July the vertical Mode V2 is close to 12 h and in mid-to end of September the vertical Mode V3 is close to 24 h. In these situations, these modes are selected out of the spectrum of possible internal waves and the reservoir behaves as a forced oscillator in resonance with the wind. The structure and the period of these vertical modes have been elucidated by using the 3D model ELCOM reservoir.						casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076													0733-9429					APR	2008	134	4					416	425		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:4(416)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:4(416)													WOS:000254486100006
J	Graham, NE; Georgakakos, KP; Vargas, C; Echevers, M				Graham, Nicholas E.; Georgakakos, Konstantine P.; Vargas, Carlos; Echevers, Modesto			Simulating the value of El Nino forecasts for the Panama Canal	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal's primary storage facility, for operations-principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July-December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914-1997. Operational capabilities to predict tropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment "virtual" canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981-1998. The results show the following main points: (i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate. (ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies. (iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments. (iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately SUS 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.

A Note of a Unique Inland, Saline Water Fishery: Brine Flies (Diptera: Ephydridae) of Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico	WATER												Fisheries in Cuitzeo, the second largest Mexican lake, used to take place on the permanent freshwater East and Central Basins as opposed to the temporal, saline, and initially thought barren West Basin. The 1980 fisheries collapse forced fishers to look for non-conventional fishing products elsewhere in the lake. The West Basin's temporal, saline-alkaline, and shallow water provides exceptional habitat for ephydrids to flourish. Locally known as "pupa", ephydrids are collected in large numbers. Although consumed since pre-Hispanic times, no other commercial fisheries of ephydrids are known worldwide. This study records the species composition and abundance of the "pupa" throughout an annual cycle in the West Basin, where fisheries occur. Two species were found: Ephydra hians and Lamproscatella muria. Ephydrids co-occurred in June and July at the end of the dry season when salinity was highest. L. muria was more abundant (954 +/- 2385 ind m(-2)) than E. hians (94 +/- 38 ind m(-2)). The relatively low salinity of the West Basin favoured L. muria over E. hians, which prefers higher salinities. This "pupa" fishery is still unpredictable due to the astatic nature of the lake, and hence limited economic importance to the local fishers.

Grassland degradation directly affects the soil water storage capacity. However, the impact of degradation on specific soil storage capacity, especially alpine shrubs, is rarely studied. Here, we chose two plots of alpine non-degraded shrub and degraded shrub, using the automatic soil moisture monitoring system to study the change process of soil moisture storage, and then adopted the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to quantitatively evaluate the relative influence of environmental variables on soil water storage. Our results show: (1) The soil water storage in the growing season (May-September) is higher than that in the non-growing season (January-April and October-December), and the soil water storage reaches its highest in mid-July. (2) During the growing season, the 100 cm soil temperature was the most important factor affecting the seasonal variation in soil water storage, accounting for 51% of the total variation. During the non-growing season, the 40 cm soil temperature was the most important factor affecting the variation in soil water storage, accounting for 80% of the total variation. (3) The soil water storage of non-degraded Potentilla fruticosa shrub meadow increased by 6-25%, compared with degraded grassland shrub meadow during growing-season. (4) Various meteorological factors have a weak impact on soil water storage.					; zhang, shiju/GWV-2688-2022; xiaowei, guo/ADO-5309-2022; guo, xiao wei/ADO-5309-2022	Li, Jing/0000-0002-2854-542X; guo, xiao wei/0000-0002-2519-7087														1424-2818				MAR	2022	14	3							185	10.3390/d14030185	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14030185													WOS:000775449000001

Point counts along the shoreline of the lake were employed to identify and record birds. Potential threats to the lake were identified through field observation and via key informant interviews. A total number of 56 bird species belonging to 23 families, and 11 orders were observed. One species, the Blue winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) was endemic, three species were near-endemic, and five species were vulnerable in their conservation status. A significantly higher number of species (i.e., 47) was recorded in the dry season than in the wet season (i.e., 24). The relative abundance of birds was also significantly higher during the dry season (t = 2.23, P > 0.05). The study also showed that Lake Arekit is under severe threats including urbanization with unwise waste disposals, siltation, and intensive agricultural expansion. Therefore, urgent stakeholder actions are required to save this lake and thereby the vast array of its biodiversity particularly the birds.					; Kidane, Teklebrhan/MUL-9783-2025; Tilahun, Belete/AAR-8815-2021; Bezabih, Azmeraw/AAA-4724-2021	Tefera, Belete Tilahun/0000-0001-8831-6672; 													1565-9801	2224-4662				MAR	2022	68	1-4					74	83		10.1163/22244662-bja10032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22244662-bja10032													WOS:000879200800001

Diets of breeding Southwestern willow flycatchers in different habitats	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We identified arthropods in fecal samples from 56 Southwestern Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii extimus) at three localities in Nevada and Arizona with different plant communities during the 2004 breeding season. We concurrently collected arthropods in flight with Malaise traps and on different plant species by sweep net. These potential prey were identified to Order and counted. Fecal samples contained 57 taxa of spiders and insects including 32 families in 8 Orders. Flycatchers consumed similar diversities (numbers of taxa), but different taxonomic compositions (abundances in Orders) of arthropods among localities. Diets of E. t. extimus more closely resembled compositions of arthropods swept from plants than those trapped in flight with Malaise traps. Fecal samples at Upper Pahranagat Lake in southern Nevada contained arthropod compositions most related to those swept from Salix gooddingii. Fecal samples at the Virgin River near Mesquite in southern Nevada, where Salix exigua and naturalized Tamarix ramosissima grow, contained arthropod compositions most related to those swept from S. exigua. Fecal samples at Topock Marsh in western Arizona contained arthropod compositions most related to those swept from T. ramosissima, the dominant vegetation. The relation between flycatcher diet and arthropod composition on plants was least at Topock Marsh, suggesting prey from other communities are important in supplementing the fauna that develop on introduced Tamarix. The diverse diet of Southwestern Willow Flycatchers may take advantage of the increased nitrogen and sulfur contents of spiders and predaceous insects.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				DEC	2007	119	4					547	557		10.1676/06-101.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/06-101.1													WOS:000252113600003

This work presents a detailed characterization of the methane cycle in a tropical coastal lagoon (La Mancha, Veracruz, Mexico) and its tributary river over three distinct seasons, along a transect from the river to the sea connection. In addition to several physicochemical parameters, the dissolved methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen concentrations were measured with high resolution in the sediments and the water column, combined with production/uptake rates. Methane and carbon dioxide cycles were further constrained by determining atmospheric flux over the entire river and lagoon sections. The results indicate that La Mancha is a highly contrasted ecosystem. The river section is characterized by a strong pycnocline, relatively high methane concentration, and active methanogenesis and methanotrophy, discharging into a relatively homogeneous lagoon section where the methane and carbon cycles are less active. Overall, both the river and the lagoon were a net source of methane and carbon dioxide, with an annual emission of 2.9 metric tons of methane and 2757 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The spatial structure of the main components of the methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen cycles was established, and it was observed that depthwise heterogeneities predominated in the river section. In contrast, lengthwise heterogeneities dominated in the lagoon section.

J	Ghosh, D; Biswas, JK				Ghosh, Dipankar; Biswas, Jayanta Kumar			Catch per unit efforts and impacts of gears on fish abundance in an oxbow lake ecosystem in Eastern India	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Background: Oxbow lakes are abundant in indigenous fishes, but they are subject to unsustainable fishing practices, potential overexploitation, and indiscriminate use of fine-meshed fishing gear. To quantify the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and impact of fishing gears on fish abundance, a survey was carried out in an oxbow lake in eastern India. Methods: The gear-wise CPUE for fish caught in per unit hour of operation was calculated by dividing the total sampling gear catch in biomass, which is the observed value of fish caught by a particular gear, by the total sampling effort hours. A value of P < 0.05 was accepted as statistical significance. Results: Average annual values of the CPUE of triangular push nets, gill nets, long lines, seine nets, drag nets, stationary dip nets, cone-framed cast nets, and line and hook were calculated as 328.34, 4.12, 36.71, 572.92, 3928.57, 237.78, 235.80, and 0.44 grams of fish per hour of operation, respectively. All the 8 different gears exhibited lower CPUE during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons than in the pre-monsoon season. The line and hook was dominant (>71%). Cone-framed cast net hauled the maximum catch in biomass (31.51%), and gill nets contributed the maximum number of fish (64.92%). The lower CPUE values of line and hook, gill net, cone-framed cast net and long lines identified them as the most harmful among all gears. Conclusion: Indiscriminate use of gear, particularly line and hook, gill nets, cone-framed cast nets, and long lines, demands regulations and preventions concerning such gear to obtain higher fish abundance.

Coastal lakes are recipients of, and thus are connected to, both marine and terrestrial environments. Thus, they may host microbial assemblages that reflect the relative degree of influence by, and connectivity to, either system. In order to address this idea, we interrogated microbial community diversity at 49 sites in seven ponds in two seasons in the Lake MacLeod basin, a system fed by seawater flowing inland through underground karst. Environmental and spatial variation within ponds explain <9% of the community structure, while identity of the pond that samples were taken from explains 50% of community variation. That is, ponds each host distinct assemblages despite similarities in size, environment and position in the landscape, indicating a dominant role for local species sorting. The ponds contain a substantial amount of previously unknown microbial taxa, reflecting the unusual nature of this inland system. Rare marine taxa, possibly dispersed from seawater assemblages via the underground karst connection, are abundant within the inland system, suggesting an important role for regional dispersal within the metacommunities.

J	Pu, P; Zhang, Z; Wang, M				Pu, Peng; Zhang, Zhi; Wang, Min			Seasonal Variation and Significance of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity on Algal Blooming in Chongqing Urban Section of Jialing River	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Water samples were collected in a main branch of upstream Yangtze river, Jialing river, from 5 sampling sites along Chongqing to study the significance of alkaline phosphatase activity to algal blooming in discharging stage of three Gorges reservoir. The seasonal evolution of phosphorus fraction, alkaline phosphatase activity, algal cells amount and enzymatic kinetic parameters were investigated from 2011 to 2012. Results showed the amount of algal cells was highest in discharging stages with low dissolved inorganic phosphorus and was lowest in flood stages with, high dissolved inorganic phosphorus. An expected negative correlation (y = 0.0054x(-1.6428), R-2 = 0.5153) between alkaline phosphatase activity and dissolved inorganic phosphorus and positive correlation (y = 0.0821x(+0.3867), R-2 = 0,7266) between alkaline phosphatase activity and algal cells amount were found. However a higher ratio of total nitrogen and total phosphorus indicated phosphorus limitation during discharging stage. The co-occurring of high alkaline phosphatase activity and algal blooming can be explained that alkaline phosphatase activity induces dissolved organic phosphorus decomposition and mineralization into dissolved inorganic phosphorus, which is bio-avaiiable and supports algal growth when algal blooming occurs. The lower K-m values and higher V-max, values during discharging stage indicated high substrate affinity and catalysis efficiency. The study covered a full operating period Of three Gorges reservoir, focusing on phosphorus fraction, kinetic parameters and their relationship with algal blooming, provided possible explanations of the Mechanism of algal blooming under phosphorus limiting conditions and highlighted the ecological significance of alkaline phosphatase activity.					yang, zhiwen/HTS-4958-2023														0970-7077	0975-427X				SEP	2014	26	18	B				6067	6072		10.14233/ajchem.2014.16675	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.16675													WOS:000343955700035
J	Wang, H; Zhou, YY; Pang, Y; Wang, XM				Wang, Hua; Zhou, Yiyi; Pang, Yong; Wang, Xianmin			Influence of Dredging on Sedimentary Arsenic Release for a Tide-Influenced Waterfront Body	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												We evaluated the influence of sediment dredging on sedimentary As release for the Inner Lake, a typical tide-influenced waterfront body in the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Zhengjiang, China. By field investigation and laboratory experiment, the As content in the deposited sediment before dredging was analyzed and the relationship between dynamic disturbance and sedimentary As release intensity was established. Using a numerical model in which the factors of water current, suspended sediment, and As were coupled, the processes of As migration were simulated for typical years and tidal cycles before and after dredging. The results show that: (i) the amounts of sedimentary As release during the tidal cycles in the flood season and the dry season after dredging were reduced by 14.6 and 28.1%, respectively, compared with before dredging; (ii) after removal of the surface polluted sediment, the annual volumes of internal released As in the high-water year, common-water year, and low-water year were decreased to 11.89, 4.94, and 4.89 Mg, respectively; and (iii) the highest reduction rate could reach 27.5% in the common-water year, while the lowest was 10.92% in the high-water year because the massive water exchange with the Yangtze River in the high-water year resulted in an enhanced dynamic disturbance that played a more dominating role in the internal As release than the surface sediment removal. The results of this study may be useful for other researchers of water environment protection for waterfront bodies.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2014	43	5					1585	1592		10.2134/jeq2013.09.0351	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.09.0351								25603244					WOS:000343154200008
J	Zhang, CZ; Kaneko, A; Zhu, XH; Lin, J				Zhang Chuanzheng; Kaneko, Arata; Zhu Xiaohua; Lin Ju			Nontidal sea level changes in Hiroshima Bay, Japan	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Nontidal sea level changes generated in Hiroshima Bay of the Seto-Inland Sea in Japan are studied over various time scales, from the sub-tidal (2 d to 1 month) to inter-annual scales (>2 years). The total sea level variation produces a standard deviation (STD) of 12.5 cm. The inter-annual component of the sea level variation in Hiroshima Bay oscillates with a STD of 3.4 cm, forming a long-term trend of 4.9 mm/a. The STD of the sea level variation is 9.8 cm for the seasonal component (8 months to 2 years) and 4.7 cm for the intra-seasonal one (1 month to 8 months). Significant sea level variations with a STD of 4.2 cm also occur in the sub-tidal range. Special attention is paid to the sub-tidal sea level changes. It is found that the upwelling and associated transient sea level changes generated along the north coast of Hiroshima Bay (opened southward) by the strong northerly wind, play a significant role in sub-tidal sea level changes. The transient sea level changes are over 10 cm in most cases when caused by typhoons that pass through the Pacific Ocean off the Kii Peninsula, located at about 400 km east of Hiroshima Bay.

We conducted a sunlight exposure experiment and developed a method to estimate the degree of photodegradation by using DSBP/DAS1 ratio in environmental samples. The observed seasonal pattern of the vertical distributions of the Ph/As in the water column can be explained by stratification of the water, photodegradation in the euphotic zone, the subsurface loading of river water, and their seasonal changes. The DSBP/DAS1 ratio was much lower in the lake water (0.12-0.52) than in sewage (6.4 +/- 1.1), indicating intensive photodegradation in rivers and the lake. A mass balance calculation and DSBP/DAS1 ratio demonstrated that similar to 95% of DSBP and similar to 55% of DAS1 supplied in sewage were photodegraded in inflowing rivers and the lake, and that sedimentation to the lake bottom is insignificant for DSBP and similar to 35% for DAS1. More intensive photodegradation of FWAs, especially more photodegradable DSBP, in Lake Biwa than in Greifensee, a lake in Switzerland, was suggested, attributable to the longer residence time of water in and the larger size of Lake Biwa. These results demonstrate that photodegradation is important to the fate of FWAs in lacustrine environments, and that FWAs and the DSBP/DAS1 ratio are useful markers for understanding the role of direct photodegradation in the behavior of water-soluble chemicals in aquatic environments.					; Takada, Hideshige/G-1096-2013	Hayakawa, Kazuhide/0000-0001-9434-9729; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2010	44	20					7796	7801		10.1021/es100465v	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es100465v								20809589					WOS:000282727500013

However, little is known about the sulfate-reducing communities inhabiting petroleum hydrocarbon (PHQ-contaminated freshwater aquifer sediments. The purpose of this study was to identify the groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) selectively stimulated when sediment from a PHC-contaminated freshwater aquifer was incubated in sulfate-reducing aquifer microcosms that were amended with specific carbon sources (acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, and citrate). After 2 months of incubation, the SRB community was characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis combined with multivariate statistics as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Molybdate was used to specifically inhibit SRB in separate microcosms to investigate the contribution of non-SRB to carbon source degradation. Results indicated that sulfate reduction in the original sediment was an important process but was limited by the availability of sulfate. Substantially lower amounts of acetate and butyrate were degraded in molybdate treatments as compared to treatments without molybdate, suggesting that SRB were the major bacterial group responsible for carbon source turnover in microcosms. All of the added carbon sources induced changes in the SRB community structure. Members of the genus Desulfobulbus were present but not active in the original sediment but an increase of the fatty acids 15:1omega6c and 17:1omega6c and FISH results showed an enrichment of these bacteria in microcosms amended with propionate or lactate. The appearance of cy17:0 revealed that bacteria affiliated with the Desulfobacteriaceae were responsible for acetate degradation. Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum spp. were not important populations within the SRB community in microcosms because they did not proliferate on carbon sources usually favored by these organisms. Metabolic, PLFA, and FISH results provided information on the SRB community in a PHC-contaminated freshwater environment, which exhibited stimulation patterns similar to other (e.g. marine) environments.

Natural disturbance patterns provide one baseline for such management, What has been largely ignored is the pattern of human habitation patterns (i,e,, housing), on landscapes. The objective of this study is to discuss landscape level management options for the northwest Wisconsin Pine Barrens based on both landscape ecology and the human demographics of the region. Using the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census we examined current housing density, seasonal housing unit concentration, historic housing density change and projected future housing densities, These data were related to land cover and land ownership data using a GIS. Housing density increase was particularly pronounced in the central Pine Barrens, an area where seasonal housing units are common. Lakes and streams were more abundant in areas that exhibited highest growth. Within national forest lands, 80% of the area contained no housing units, In contrast, only 12% of the area in small private land ownership contained no housing. These results are integrated with previous studies of presettlement vegetation and landscape change to discuss landscape level management suggestions for the Pine Barrens.

A Hybrid Dataset of Historical Cool-Season Lake Effects From the Eastern Great Lakes of North America	FRONTIERS IN WATER												The moistening of cold air passing over the Great Lakes of North America has a profound impact on the cool season climate of regions downwind, from relatively benign air mass modification to highly-impactful snowfall events. The importance of lake effects has led to the development of varying techniques for systematically identifying lake-effect days. The results of two such methods are merged here to yield a more thorough record of lake-effect days for the eastern Great Lakes. Comparative analysis of the data sets illustrates the different objectives of the two methodologies, where one identifies days with a synoptic setup conducive to lake-effect snowfall, and the other identifies days with lake-effect modification of the overlying air mass. A smaller population of "absolute" lake-effect days are those identified by both methods, while a larger population of "hybrid" lake-effect days are absolute days plus those identified by one method but not the other. For a 51-year study period ending with the 2014-15 cool season, the absolute data set yields a mean of about 15 lake-effect days per year, or 8% of the November through April season, while the hybrid data set yields a mean of 56 lake-effect days per year, or 31% of the season. The frequencies of absolute, air mass modification-defined, and hybrid lake-effect days decreased through the study period, with days within the hybrid data set declining at a statistically significant rate of 2.8 days per decade, although most obviously from the late 1970s through the early 2000s. The result is a general drying of the cool-season lake-effect hydroclimate. The merged data set offers a more thorough historical record of days available for atmospheric and hydroclimatic study of the lake-effect phenomenon within the eastern Great Lakes region.

Shoot density, total aboveground and belowground biomass and their C, N, P and S contents were also determined. Samples were collected from three vigorous and three die-back sites of Lake Ferto/Neusiedler See in 1996 and 1997. Reed stands were compared when the biomass was maximal in both years. Reed shoots were significantly (p = 5%) shorter, thinner and had less internodes at the die-back sites than at the vigorous sites, where the aboveground biomass was 1.5-2.0 times and the leaf area index (LAI) 1.7-2.5 times higher. The belowground biomass was nearly the same at the vigorous and die-back sites. The amount of decaying belowground biomass was less than 50% of the total belowground biomass at the vigorous sites, while it reached 75% at the die-back sites. Different N, C, P and S concentrations were found in the reed organs studied (leaves, culm, rhizome and roots). The N concentration in leaves, culm and rhizome was higher at the die-back sites, where the P concentration was the lowest. There were no significant differences in the S concentration of the examined reed organs as comparing the vigorous and degraded reeds. The C concentration of culms were higher, while that of the living rhizomes were lower at healthy than at the die-back sites. The N, P, C and S standing stocks in the aboveground biomass were significantly lower at the die-back sites than at the vigorous sites. In the belowground biomass the P standing stock was significantly lower, while the N standing stock was significantly higher at the die-back sites than at the vigorous sites. Not more than 17% of the total dry mass m(-2), 17% of the C, 24% of the N, 14% of the S and 27% of the P standing stock was found in the aboveground phytomass produced in the actual year.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				APR	2010	65	2					237	247		10.2478/s11756-010-0006-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-010-0006-x													WOS:000274743500010
J	Rennie, MD; Collins, NC; Purchase, CF; Tremblay, A				Rennie, MD; Collins, NC; Purchase, CF; Tremblay, A			Predictive models of benthic invertebrate methylmercury in Ontario and Quebec lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Multivariate analyses on benthic invertebrate methylmercury concentrations ([MeHg]) and water chemistry from 12 Quebec water bodies were used to guide the construction of simple, predictive models of benthic invertebrate [MeHg] in 23 lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Separate predictive models for collector-shredder and predatory benthic invertebrates were constructed using multiple regression and were assessed for their predictive utility by cross-validation. Predatory benthic invertebrate [MeHg] was negatively related to pH and positively related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (cross-validation r(2) = 0.31). Collector-shredder [MeHg] was positively related to [DOC] only (cross-validation r(2) = 0.13). Predictive utility of our models is similar to or surpasses that observed in previously published zooplankton MeHg models tested against independently collected data. Significant environmental variables and their contribution to the overall explanatory power of benthic invertebrate MeHg models are similar to those found in zooplankton models, suggesting that in both pelagic and benthic food webs, pH and DOC are important indicators of MeHg bioavailability. Although seasonal patterns in invertebrate [MeHg] were examined, none was detected. These models represent an effective means of identifying water bodies of interest for researchers and for reconstructing past benthic invertebrate [MeHg] patterns using archived water chemistry data.					; Purchase, Craig/Q-5496-2018	Collins, Nicholas/0000-0002-6901-6604; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2005	62	12					2770	2783		10.1139/F05-181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-181													WOS:000233799100010
J	Aguilar, P; Vila, I; Sommaruga, R				Aguilar, Pablo; Vila, Irma; Sommaruga, Ruben			Bacterioplankton Zonation Does Exist in High Elevation, Polymictic Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The assessment of distribution patterns or zonation of planktonic microbes along the water column is a crucial step to interpret their function in the ecosystem. In lakes without seasonal thermal stratification or polymictic systems such as high elevation tropical lakes, planktonic bacterial taxa are probably homogeneously distributed in the water column in contrast to what is known for thermally stratified lakes. However, we know little about bacterial distribution patterns in polymictic lakes and their relation to environmental gradients other than temperature. Here we assessed the diversity, microdiversity, and bacterial community composition at different discrete depths in three high elevation lakes (4,400-4,550 m above sea level) from the Andean plateau to test whether bacterial zonation patterns exist along the water column. For this objective, we analyzed bulk DNA and the putatively active fraction (cDNA) of the 16S rRNA gene. Although a clear gradient of temperature and oxygen was not detected along the water column, a significant vertical spatial zonation of the bacterial communities was present in two out of the three lakes, with microdiversity contributing to such pattern. Our results provide a reference for understanding how changing environmental conditions could affect high elevation aquatic ecosystems, particularly when warming is amplified with elevation, accelerating changes in hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Finally, our results highlight the importance of incorporating the whole water column in ecological studies of aquatic ecosystems lacking temporal or permanent thermal stratification.

J	Kamenir, Y; Dubinsky, Z; Zohary, T				Kamenir, Y; Dubinsky, Z; Zohary, T			Phytoplankton size structure stability in a meso-eutrophic subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of the present study was to analyze seasonal and inter-annual variability, and examine the stability of several parameters describing the size structure of the phytoplankton assemblage of Lake Kinneret (Israel). Phytoplankton biomass size spectrum (BSS) patterns were analyzed using cell-volume data based on microscopic counts of samples collected biweekly over 4 years (1996-1999). A typical pattern of Lake Kinneret phytoplankton BSS emerged, as being quasi-stable in spite of unprecedented man-induced lowering of the lake's water levels during those years, atypical phytoplankton biomass dynamics, and extreme inter-annual variations in phytoplankton species composition. The present study included all phytoplankton greater than ca. 2 mum diameter, which comprise most of the lake's autotrophic biomass, and phytoplankton alone. Statistical descriptors of separate size classes elucidate two zones of pronounced variability within Kinneret BSS and a zone of stability near its center. The phytoplankton biomass variability is produced mainly by two bloom zones, at relatively large cell size classes (V = 2048-4096 and V = 65 500-131000 mum(3)), corresponding with proliferation of the bloom-forming species Aulacoseira granulata and Peridinium gatunense, respectively, while the stability zone at the center of the BSS, essentially a 'nanoplankton plateau', corresponds with a diverse assemblage of nanoplanktonic species, of different taxonomic composition at different times. Statistical parameters of BSS approximation provide a tool for the quantitative estimation of the stability/variability of whole phytoplankton assemblages. According to these parameters, Kinneret BSS is comparable to BSS of eutrophic lakes of Canada and Spain but differs from the more stable BSS typical of oligotrophic systems.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2004	520	1-3					89	104		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027729.53348.c7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027729.53348.c7													WOS:000221391900008

This study focuses on application of satellite microwave images to estimate the spatial distribution of snow depth and SWE over the Great Lakes area. To estimate SWE, we have proposed the algorithm which uses microwave brightness temperatures (Tb) measured by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) radiometer along with information on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The algorithm was developed and tested over 19 test sites characterized by different seasonal average snow depth and land cover type. Three spectral signatures derived from SSM/I data, namely T19V-T37V (GTV), T19H-T37H (GTH), and T22V-T85V (SSI), were examined for correlation with the snow depth and SWE. To avoid melting snow conditions, we have used observations taken only during the period from December 1-February 28. It was found that GTH, and GTV exhibit similar correlation with the snow depth/SWE and are most should be used over deep snowpack. In the same time, SSI is more sensitive to snow depth variations over a shallow snow pack. To account for the effect of dense forests on the scattering signal of snow we established the slope of the regression line between GTV and the snow depth as a function of NDVI. The accuracy of the new technique was evaluated through its comparison with ground-based measurements and with results of SWE analysis prepared by the National Operational Hydrological Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) of the National Weather Service. The proposed algorithm was found to be superior to previously developed global microwave SWE retrieval techniques.

Marshall			Prairie Wolf Slough Wetlands Demonstration Project: A Case Study Illustrating the Need for Incorporating Soil and Water Quality Assessment in Wetland Restoration Planning, Design and Monitoring	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In northeastern Illinois, restored wetlands are used to improve water quality in streams degraded by agriculture and urban development. Using freshwater wetlands to reduce nitrogen loading to lakes and rivers is well documented; however, there are fewer studies addressing their use to remove phosphorous. In 1998, a systematic water quality monitoring project was begun at Prairie Wolf Slough Wetland Demonstration Project, a restored palustrine emergent marsh wetland located on an abandoned farm field north of Chicago. The wetland drains 98 ha of mixed land uses into the Chicago River. Our objectives were to assess spatial and temporal variations in total suspended solids, soluble reactive and total phosphorous concentrations, and mass loadings and compute a mass balance and retention efficiency for these constituents. Water sampling was conducted from 1998 to 2003. In 2004, soil samples were collected from the marsh and an adjacent abandoned farm site and analyzed for soil test (Bray) phosphorus. The marsh effectively traps suspended solids but acts as a source of soluble reactive and total phosphorous to the river both during the growing and nongrowing seasons. Net export of phosphorous from the wetland was likely due to mobilization of orthophosphate as a result of anoxic conditions produced during inundation events. Often little consideration is given to the link between soil and water quality when locating restoration sites. Our study adds to a growing body of literature that clearly demonstrates the need for both soil and water quality assessments in wetland restoration planning, design, and monitoring.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				DEC	2008	16	4					618	628		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00492.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00492.x													WOS:000261273200012
J	WEIHER, E; KEDDY, PA				WEIHER, E; KEDDY, PA			THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERIMENTAL WETLAND PLANT-COMMUNITIES	OIKOS												The ability to predict the composition of communities from environmental factors is a central goal of community ecology. We carefully selected a pool of species and subjected it to a range of environmental factors to determine which factors were able to filter out subsets of species. We began with a pool of 20 species and sowed them into 120 wetland microcosms representing 24 different habitat treatments and monitored them for 5 yr. The treatments were fertility, water depth, fluctuations in water depth, soil texture, leaf litter, length of the initial growing season, and invasion by Typha. After 5 yr 14 species persisted; no rare species survived. The experimental communities differed from random expectation and were assembled by rules that constrained their organization. There were strong and consistent effects of fertility, water level, and leaf litter on community composition. Community assembly was modeled as a series of environmental filters. Some aspects of assembly were deterministic: trajectories were constrained within two ''pathway basins'' and species rank abundances were significantly concordant within treatments. Other factors indicated that assembly has a strong stochastic component: 50% of species were present only occasionally and we cannot accurately predict species ranks. Community stochasticity did not show any clear patterns among treatments.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				SEP	1995	73	3					323	335		10.2307/3545956	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545956													WOS:A1995TA64800004

Brazilian research on extremophiles in the context of astrobiology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY												Extremophiles are organisms adapted to grow at extreme ranges of environmental variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth. Most extremophiles are micro-organisms that belong to the Archaea and Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies, and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite the tropical climate, Brazil has a wide range of ecosystems which include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example, the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+3 concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example, these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent. The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives in this area.

Climatic and human impacts on the hydrogeochemical functioning of Lake Ifrah (Middle Atlas, Morocco)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Climatic and human impacts on the hydrogeochemical functioning of Lake Ifrah (Middle Atlas, Morocco) Monitoring hydrogeochemical seasonality of Lake Ifrah (Morocco) was carried out between 2003 and 2006 in order to characterize the hydrogeochemical processes in the context of climatic and anthropogenic impacts. Lake Ifrah has declined significantly over the last decade. The waters are fairly alkaline, oxygenated, fairly turbid and oversaturated alkaline. The suspended load is moderately high. The hydrogeochemical facies is typically chloro-sodium bicarbonate magnesium. The lake is experiencing a significant water deficit as a result of recurrent droughts over the last three decades and marked human pressure. This is reflected by the increase in salinity manifested primarily by increased electrical conductivity and alkali contents (Na+ and K+) and chloride. This deficit is also assessed by lower levels of alkaline earth (Ca2+ and Mg2+) as a result of their precipitation as endogenic carbonates. The saturation index of calcite, aragonite and dolomite is always greater than zero. The increase in nutrients (phosphorus and nitrates) and degradation of water oxygenation reflect the acceleration of the eutrophication of the lake which is also evident from the increased particulate load and turbidity of the water.					; ETEBAAI, Issam/AAX-4819-2021; MICHE, Hélène/B-9597-2014	Brahim, Damnati/0000-0002-5813-3282; ETEBAAI, Issam/0000-0001-5941-656X													0262-6667						2012	57	3					547	561		10.1080/02626667.2012.660158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2012.660158													WOS:000304453200012

Differing temporal patterns of Chara hornemannii cover correlate to alternate regimes of phytoplankton and submerged aquatic-vegetation dominance	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Cover of the alga Chara hornemannii Wallman and water-quality parameters were measured over a 3-year period in adjacent mangrove subestuaries in Florida Bay, so as to describe temporal variability and infer relationships between Chara cover and water quality that will assist resource managers to restore Chara abundance to historically higher levels. A seasonal pattern of Chara cover was observed in the Alligator Creek subestuary that coincided with seasonal changes in water transparency in a relatively high-nutrient and phytoplankton environment. In contrast, higher Chara cover in the relatively low-nutrient and phytoplankton-abundance McCormick Creek subestuary did not exhibit a repeatable seasonal pattern, but was temporally negatively correlated with salinity and water depth. These observations suggest that water transparency may determine the importance of the salinity driver in these Chara communities. The present study demonstrates the differential importance of water quality and environmental drivers in estuaries distinguished by alternate regimes of phytoplankton and submerged aquatic-vegetation (SAV) dominance, and explains how differences in local estuarine geography may filter the response of SAV communities to environmental stressors.					; Fourqurean, James/AAY-9611-2020	Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500; Barr, Jordan/0000-0002-6460-3463													1323-1650	1448-6059					2012	63	11			SI		1005	1014		10.1071/MF12036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12036													WOS:000311409300006

Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify influential parameters and Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to assess model uncertainty. The calculated and measured values of the model were in good agreement except for suspended solids, which might be due to disregarding the plankton in water. The major source of alpha-HCH was an input from atmospheric advection, while the major environmental outputs were atmospheric advection and sediment degradation. The net annual input and output of alpha-HCH were approximately 0.294 t and 0.412 t, respectively. Sediment was an important sink for alpha-HCH. Seasonal patterns in various media were successfully modeled and factors leading to this seasonality were discussed. Sensitivity analysis found that parameters of source and degradation were more important than the other parameters. The sediment was influenced more by various parameters than air and water were. Temperature variation had a greater impact on the dynamics of the model output than other dynamic parameters. Uncertainty analysis showed that the model uncertainty was relatively low but significantly increased in the second half of the simulation period due to the increase in the gas-water diffusion flux variability.					; Kong, Xiangzhen/JCD-7439-2023; He, Wei/C-7426-2015; Li, Qing/KCZ-1775-2024; Yang, Yongyong/HIZ-8645-2022	He, Wei/0000-0002-3671-8650; 													1537-744X						2012									691539	10.1100/2012/691539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1100/2012/691539								23365527					WOS:000312852400001

Detecting Invasive Round Goby in Wadeable Streams: A Comparison of Gear Types	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The invasion of round goby Neogobius melanostomus into tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes poses concerns for the conservation of native fish communities and the functioning of stream ecosystems. In streams, where standard methods for detection are lacking, development of sensitive sampling methods to identify round goby-invaded sites is a prerequisite for the implementation of effective management strategies. We sampled 34 stream sites that spanned a range of goby densities with two active gears (electrofishing and seining) and one passive gear (minnow traps) to compare gear efficiency at detecting invasive round goby. Naive occupancy, defined as the number of sites where goby were detected with each gear divided by the total number of sites, was 0.79 (27/34 sites) for seining, 0.68 (23/34) for electrofishing, and 0.50 (17/34) for traps. The probability of detecting a single round goby in a single pass (determined with single-season, constant-probability models) was 0.75 +/- 0.065 (mean +/- SE) for minnow traps, 0.69 +/- 0.056 for seining, and 0.47 +/- 0.075 for electrofishing. Mean +/- SE catch per unit effort (CPUE; round goby/min) was 0.716 + 0.158 for seining, 0.137 +/- 0.043 for electrofishing, and 0.078 +/- 0.022 for minnow traps, seining being significantly more efficient than minnow traps and electrofishing. The CPUE did not differ between electrofishing and traps. Mean goby size did not differ among gear types, but a size bias was detected when data from a related study were included in the analysis, seining capturing smaller round goby. Based on the sensitivity and efficiency of seining, we conclude that when stream conditions allow, this gear is a practical means of detecting round goby and determining their abundance in streams.					tiegs, scott/JXM-6032-2024														0275-5947	1548-8675					2012	32	2					360	364		10.1080/02755947.2012.678964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.678964													WOS:000303601100016
J	Dowling, TE; Marsh, PC; Kelsen, AT; Tibbets, CA				Dowling, TE; Marsh, PC; Kelsen, AT; Tibbets, CA			Genetic monitoring of wild and repatriated populations of endangered razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus, Catostomidae, Teleostei) in Lake Mohave, Arizona-Nevada	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The Native Fishes Work Group, formed in 1991, developed and implemented a protocol to enhance the dwindling razorback sucker population in Lake Mohave, Arizona-Nevada. This large, genetically diverse population is severely reduced in size as a result of recruitment failure associated with predation on larvae. To circumvent this problem, wild larvae are captured, reared in protective custody until they are large enough to escape predation, and then released back into the lake. We present results of a monitoring program designed to assess the effectiveness of the sampling design in transmitting the high genetic diversity found in wild adults. Variation in a fragment from the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome b was examined by analysis of single-stranded polymorphisms and direct sequencing. Samples were characterized from three life history stages. Characterization of wild adults verified previous results that identified considerable diversity and provided baseline data. Samples of larvae from several temporal collections from throughout the spawning season and four geographical areas were characterized for 7 years (1997-2003) to assess the transmission of genetic variation from wild adults to larvae. Several analyses identified significant differences among temporal collections, resulting from sampling errors associated with finite number of females spawning at a given time and place. Comparisons among areas and years failed to identify significant variation, indicating that pooled collections for each year possess the same levels and patterns of genetic variation. Examination of repatriates representing 11 years (1992-2002) also failed to identify significant differences among cohorts; however, some sample sizes were small and the AMOVA may lack sufficient power to detect differences. Contrasts of wild adults, larvae, and repatriates identified statistically significant differences among collections within these three groups; however, levels of variation are small and not biologically meaningful. More importantly, this analysis failed to detect significant differences among adults, larvae, and repatriates indicating that the program has been achieving its goal of transmitting variation from adults through the larvae and into the repatriate population. The reproductive capability of repatriates has not been examined, so it is unknown if the program will maintain genetic variation found in the original adult population. This will be most easily achieved by periodic monitoring of genetic variation in larval samples. If levels of variation become reduced in repatriates, levels and patterns of diversity in larvae are also expected to become reduced, and deviations in estimates of genetic diversity may become larger and more frequent. If this is the case, intervention may be necessary to ensure that certain individuals are not over-represented in the repatriate population.																			0962-1083	1365-294X				JAN	2005	14	1					123	135		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02408.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02408.x								15643956					WOS:000226421000011
J	Powell, LM; Bowman, JP; Skerratt, JH; Franzmann, PD; Burton, HR				Powell, LM; Bowman, JP; Skerratt, JH; Franzmann, PD; Burton, HR			Ecology of a novel Synechococcus clade occurring in dense populations in saline Antarctic lakes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The seasonal distribution and abundance of Synechococcus-like morphotypes was investigated in meromictic lakes and coastal areas of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. Populations were monitored by flow cytometry utilising phycoerythrin content and small cell size to distinguish the cells from other phytoplankton. In Ace Lake, the Synechococcus bloom commenced in September at the water temperature minimum and peaked in late November. Populations (up to 8 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) were maximally stratified at a depth of 11 m, corresponding to waters which were supersaturated with oxygen, high in phosphate and which received > 5 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1) of light. At this depth, salinity (30 g kg(-1)) was constant throughout the year and temperature ranged from 4.5 degrees C in October to 10.5 degrees C in February. In late November, high numbers of Synechococcus cells also occurred in the moderate salinity water bodies Lake Abraxas and Pendant Lake (salinity 16.5 to 31.0 g kg(-1)), with populations highly stratified in Lake Abraxas (up to 1.5 x 10(7) cells ml(-1), temperature 8.0 degrees C, salinity 20.3 g kg(-1)) but less so in the colder waters of Pendant Lake (max. 1.5 x 10(7) cells ml(-1), temperature 0.1 to 1.1 degrees C, salinity 31.0 g kg(-1)). Synechococcus populations did not occur in brackish, coastal marine or hypersaline water bodies in the Vestfold Hills. Populations appear to be controlled primarily by temperature and to a lesser extent by light availability and grazing. Characterization of non-axenic cultures indicated that the Antarctic lake Synechococcus populations were similar to other polar picocyanobacteria in terms of cardinal growth temperatures (minimum, optimum, maximum: T-min -17.0 degrees C, T-opt, 19.8 degrees C, T-max 29.5 degrees C) and slow growth. Related only peripherally to Synechococcus sp. Cluster 5.2 (Marine Cluster B), the Antarctic strains represent a unique and highly adapted clade in the stable water columns of some saline Antarctic lakes.

These blooms have occurred each year since 1991, with subsurface concentrations of >50 000 cells mL(-1). Periods of greater cyanobacterial abundance are characterized by reduced rates of vertical mixing of the water column, reduced mixed: euphotic depth ratios and high epilimnetic temperatures (>25 degreesC). Surface scums were not observed and, in general, this species displays a fairly uniform distribution throughout the euphotic zone and below. An isolate of C. raciborskii taken from Lake Julius during a bloom in November 1995 and grown in pure culture produced no symptoms of poisoning when tested by mouse bioassay, and absence of detectable concentrations of the hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin was confirmed by HPLC/MS-MS. Low concentrations of cylindrospermopsin (similar to1-2 mug L-1) were detected in the lake during blooms of C. raciborskii.																			1323-1650						2001	52	6					907	915		10.1071/MF00110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF00110													WOS:000171849400009
J	Sirivedhin, T; Gray, KA				Sirivedhin, T; Gray, KA			Part I. Identifying anthropogenic markers in surface waters influenced by treated effluents: a tool in potable water reuse	WATER RESEARCH												In potable water reuse, treated wastewater becomes part of the drinking water supply. An important question associated with this practice is whether or not the organic quality of the treated wastewater is chemically different from that of non-human impacted water. This question was addressed in a case study of indirect potable water reuse where the organic matrix of the South Platte River was analyzed upstream and downstream of the discharge of treated wastewater effluent using conventional water quality parameters combined with pyrolysis-GC/MS. Effluent-derived organic material (EfOM) was found to be more aliphatic and had higher organic nitrogen and halogen content compared to organic material derived from "natural" (non-anthropogenic) sources (NOM). Seasonal changes that resulted from the change in the contributions of aquatic and terrestrial sources were not observed in EFOM; but they were strongly observed in NOM under the control of natural processes. Using principal component and factor analyses, the pyrolysis fragments of phenol, alkyl-phenols, and acetic acid were identified as the seasonal indicators for the NOM set of samples. In contrast, benzaldehyde, benzonitrile, chlorobutanoic acid, furancarboxaldehyde, and methylfurancarboxaldehyde were identified as the indicators for wastewater inputs for the EFOM set of samples. Overall, the results from conventional water quality parameters and pyrolysis-GC/MS revealed that: (1) EfOM bears a chemical signature distinct from NOM and (2) under the conditions of this study, EfOM discharged to the South Platte River persisted and controlled organic quality at downstream points.

J	Palstra, AP; De Graaf, M; Sibbing, FA				Palstra, AP; De Graaf, M; Sibbing, FA			Riverine spawning and reproductive segregation in a lacustrine cyprinid species flock, facilitated by homing?	ANIMAL BIOLOGY												This paper aims at assessing the reproductive segregation within the endemic Barbus (renamed Labeobarbus) species flock of Lake Tana (Ethiopia). Migration, followed by temporal and spatial reproductive segregation in the upstream tributaries of two inflowing rivers was studied systematically over the 1999 and 2000 spawning seasons. Physical events that may trigger lacustrine migration and characterise suitability of spawning grounds were analysed. Six species migrate 3040 km upstream Gumara River during declining flow, just after the rainy season. Spawning occurs in the well-oxygenated gravel beds of four Gumara tributaries. Eight 'large barb' species were absent from the rivers, or found only incidentally, thus segregating them at a macro-spatial scale from the six river-spawners. The missing species spawn either in the lake or in other rivers not sampled. Long distance migration and species-specific spawning sites suggest that homing may have facilitated reproductive isolation and speciation. A fine-tuning between homing and gonad development is suggested since females reach spawning maturity only as they arrive at the spawning grounds. This study provides convincing evidence for reproductive segregation, and contributes in unravelling the evolution of this unique Labeobarbus species flock. Collective migration and riverine spawning of six Labeobarbus species makes them very vulnerable for overfishing at the spawning areas.

Of 44 chum salmon tested, 28 fish showed upstream movement to one of the choice arm, and 24 fish (85.7%) of those moved fish were found in the arm running the artificial home stream water. When the artificial home stream water flowed from the left and right arms, 88.9% and 80% of fish were observed in the left and right arms, respectively.

J	Cline, DW; Bales, RC; Dozier, J				Cline, DW; Bales, RC; Dozier, J			Estimating the spatial distribution of snow in mountain basins using remote sensing and energy balance modeling	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We present a modeling approach that couples information about snow cover duration from remote sensing with a distributed energy balance model to calculate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE) in a 1.2 km(2) mountain basin at the peak of the accumulation season. In situ measurements of incident solar radiation, incident longwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were distributed around the basin on the basis of topography. Snow surface albedo was assumed to be spatially constant and to decrease with time. Distributed snow surface temperature was estimated as a function of modeled air temperature. We computed the energy balance for each pixel at hourly intervals using the estimated radiative fluxes and bulk-aerodynamic turbulent-energy flux algorithms from a snowpack energy and mass balance model. Fractional snow cover within each pixel was estimated from three multispectral images (Landsat thematic mapper), one at peak accumulation and two during snowmelt, using decision trees and a spectral mixture model; from these we computed snow cover duration at subpixel resolution. The total cumulative energy for snowmelt at each remote sensing date was weighted by the fraction of each pixel's area that lost its snow cover by that date to determine an initial SWE for each pixel. We tested the modeling approach in the well-studied Emerald Lake basin in the southern Sierra Nevada. With no parameter fitting the modeled spatial pattern of SWE and the mean basin SWE agreed with intensive field survey data. As the modeling approach requires only a remote sensing time series and an ability to estimate the energy balance over the model domain, it should prove useful for computing SWE distributions at peak accumulation over larger areas, where extensive field measurements of SWE are not practical.

J	Peti, L; Augustinus, PC				Peti, Leonie; Augustinus, Paul C.			Micro-XRF-inferred depositional history of the Orakei maar lake sediment sequence, Auckland, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake sediment records offer insights into past climate and environmental changes. There are, however, few continuous lake sediment records from the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes that span the last glacial interval (LGI) and have the requisite chronological control and sampling resolution. Orakei maar paleolake in the Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand, is an exception, as it contains a high-resolution record of continuous lacustrine sedimentation from its formative phreatomagmatic eruption similar to 130 ka, until post-glacial sea-level rise breached the crater tuff rim and connected the lake to the sea similar to 9 ka. We used micro-XRF core scanning, dry bulk density, loss-on-ignition and visual facies descriptions to investigate the depositional history of Orakei maar lake as a response to regional and global drivers of climate change, and to erosional events in the lake catchment. The climate history of the lake was divided into six depositional phases: (I) Early warming with frequent in-wash events, followed by climate fluctuations coeval with marine isotope stages (MIS) 5e to mid-5c, (II) Warm, quiescent depositional conditions during mid-MIS 5c to 5a, (III) A colder, windier interval during MIS 4, (IV) Warmer conditions with dominantly autochthonous sedimentation during MIS 3, (V) Cold conditions followed by a slow temperature increase and the onset of sea-level rise during late MIS 2, (VI) Warm conditions that culminated in formation of a peat unit at the top of the Orakei lacustrine sediment sequence, which was terminated by an influx of massive marine muds into the basin at 9.75 ka. Comparison of the inferred climate evolution at Orakei with climate inferences from the global marine benthic MIS record during LGI shows general agreement, though inferred climate changes consistently occur earlier at Orakei than in the MIS. There is also general agreement in temperature changes inferred from the Orakei record and from other regional lake sediment records, but more detailed comparison requires additional proxy climate data such as pollen, organic geochemistry and biomarkers, to better understand discrepancies between some records. This study demonstrated the great potential of the Orakei record for paleoclimate inference and the applicability of micro-XRF core scanning data for addressing questions about paleoclimate and paleoenvironment. It also highlighted past intervals that require further study.

J	Shaked, Y; Erel, Y; Sukenik, A				Shaked, Y; Erel, Y; Sukenik, A			The biogeochemical cycle of iron and associated elements in Lake Kinneret	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Iron biogeochemical cycling and distribution between particulate, reactive (colloidal + dissolved, oxine-labile, Fe(II)) fractions were studied in the seasonally stratified, mesotrophic Lake Kinneret. This article presents various aspects of the Fe budget in the lake and relates them to the chemical reactivity of various physicochemical forms of Fe. The budget of Fe in Lake Kinneret is dominated by fluvial Fe load, rather than by internal recycling of Fe from the sediment, as shown by the fact that 75 to 94% of the variance in Fe concentrations in the lake can be explained by the fluctuation in the water discharge of the Jordan River. Iron associated with phytoplankton accounts for 9-16% of the bulk particulate Fe in the lake. However, within patches of the dominate algae, the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense, algal Fe accounts for more than 70% of the lake's particulate Fe. The algal Fe is predominantly intracellular, and the Fe: chlorophyll a ratios were within the range of published values for dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Iron associated with particles larger than 0.025 mum (20-300 nM) accounts for 80-95% of total Fe in the epilimnion of Lake Kinneret throughout the year. In contrast, this fraction of Fe is dominant in the hypolimnion only during the period of lake mixing. Iron concentration of different size fractions (<0.025 mum, <0.2 mum and >0.025 mum) in the surface water covaried throughout the research period. These covariations suggest dynamic transformations of Fe between different size fractions, either due to partial dissolution/precipitation or desorption/adsorption. Oxine-labile Fe concentrations, the Fe fraction considered chemically labile and available for phytoplankton, ranged from 15 to 75 nM. In wintertime, the oxine-labile Fe accounts for only 10-20% of the total Fe, while in other seasons most of the Fe is oxine-labile. Oxine-labile Fe concentrations always exceed the 0.025 mum-filtered Fe, implying that some of the larger particles contain oxine labile-Fe, and therefore are reactive. The fraction of reactive particles in Lake Kinneret (10-80%) is high relative to that of the marine environments, and can most likely be attributed to its fluvial source, which contains a significant proportion of reactive Fe oxide and hydrous oxide particles. The annual variability in the epilimnetic concentrations of other trace elements and nutrients, such as Al, Mn, Cd, Zn, Pb, and P were studied and grouped according to their resemblance with river water discharge, redox processes, or biological uptake and scavenging. Distribution patterns of Al, Pb and Cd resembled that of Fe, suggesting that similar processes control the concentrations of these metals, namely significant contribution from the watershed, high affinity to particulate matter and little control of biota on their fate in the lake. Other elements such as Zn and P are more affected by biological uptake, while Mn is more affected by redox cycling within the lake. Copyright (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Miller, SM; Green, ML; Depinto, JV; Hornbuckle, KC				Miller, SM; Green, ML; Depinto, JV; Hornbuckle, KC			Results from the Lake Michigan mass balance study:: Concentrations and fluxes of atmospheric polychlorinated biphenyls and trans-nonachlor	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In this paper, we summarize the data and methods used to estimate atmospheric exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trans-nonachlor with Lake Michigan. This work was conducted as part of the Lake Michigan Mass Balance (LMMB)study. For the atmospheric component of the LMMB, more than 400 gas- and particulate-phase samples were collected at eight sites on the shore around the lake (shoreline) and at 14 sites on the lake (overwater). We review the quality of the data set; describe the concentrations in atmospheric gas and particulate phases; report local, instantaneous, net gas fluxes; and estimate annual deposition of the particle-associated compounds. The quality of the data set is high except for a subset of over-water samples where PCB contamination is suspected. Gasphase trans-nonachlor concentrations (although not the resulting gas fluxes) are inversely correlated with latitude and positively correlated with temperature. Gas-phase Sigma PCBs (sum of 98 congener groups) are highest in concentration at the Chicago site and lowest at the Sleeping Bear Dunes site. The resulting Sigma PCB gas fluxes exhibit a seasonality that reflects elevated summertime gas-phase concentrations not compensated by temperature-corrected Henry's law coefficients.

Pete; Thomas, Mike			Local fisheries conservation and management works: implications of migrations and site fidelity of Arapaima in the Lower Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Effective conservation must account for fish migrations to minimize threats to freshwater fishes. Many floodplain fishes, like giant Neotropical arapaima (genus Arapaima), migrate laterally into seasonally flooded habitats to feed and reproduce. Effects of seasonal migrations on conservation efforts like community-based management remain uncertain. Acoustic telemetry was applied to arapaima in floodplain habitats (Lower Amazon) to characterize (1) lake fidelity, (2) lake population connectivity, and (3) migrations beyond managed units. During low water of 2014, 24 arapaima were captured and implanted with acoustic tags in three lakes within a 10-km diameter and across two fishing communities. During floods, the entire study area was connected, including tagging lakes. Monitoring was continuous over two annual flood cycles using an array of 19 fixed acoustic receivers in four lakes. Additional nearby lakes were surveyed with portable receivers for unaccounted individuals during subsequent dry seasons. On average, 74% of unharvested arapaima returned to the same lake; no arapaima were found outside their lake of tagging origin during subsequent dry seasons. During high water, arapaima migrations were not contained within community management units; three arapaima were found outside their community zone. Overlapping distributions of arapaima from each of three lake populations showed connectivity during flooding, especially near known spawning grounds. Results demonstrate that management by local fishers to regulate fishing within lakes can work because arapaima show fidelity to their lake of tagging origin. Current management efforts could be improved by delineating management units to networks of habitats that sustain arapaima over complete life histories.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2022	105	12			SI		2119	2132		10.1007/s10641-021-01171-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01171-y		FEB 2022											WOS:000750704300002

Seasonal prediction of lake inflows and rainfall in a hydro-electricity catchment, Waitaki river, New Zealand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Waitaki River is located in the centre of the South Island of New Zealand, and hydro-electricity generated on the river accounts for 35-40% of New Zealand's electricity. Low inflows in 1992 and 2001 resulted in teh threat of power blackouts. Improved seasonal rainfall and inflow forecasts will result in the better management of the water used in hydro-generation on a seasonal basis. Researchers have stated that two key directions in the fields of seasonal rainfall and streamflow forecasting are to a) decrease the spatial scale of forecast products, and b) tailor forecast products to end-user needs, so as to provide more relevant and targeted forecasts. Several season-ahead lake inflow and rainfall forecast models were calibrated for the Waitaki river catchment using statistical techniques to quantify relationships between land-ocean-atmosphere state variables and seasonally lagged inflows and rainfall. Techniques included principal components analysis and Multiple linear regression, with cross-validation techniques applied to estimate model error and randomization techniques used to establish the significance of the skill of the models. Many of the models calibrated Predict rainfall and inflows better than random chance and better than the long-term mean as a predictor. When compared to the range of all probable inflow seasonal totals (based oil the 80-year recorded history in the catchment). 95% confidence limits around most model predictions offer significant skill. These models explain LIP to 19% of the variance in season-ahead rainfall and inflows in this catchment. Seasonal rainfall and inflow forecasting oil a single catchment scale and focussed to end-user needs is possible with some skill in the South Island of New Zealand.

J	Chin, YP; Traina, SJ; Swank, CR; Backhus, D				Chin, YP; Traina, SJ; Swank, CR; Backhus, D			Abundance and properties of dissolved organic matter in pore waters of a freshwater wetland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The abundances, molecular weights, molar absorptivities, and polydispersities of sediment pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ferrous iron, Fe(II), were measured from three sites within a freshwater wetland (Old Woman Creek) adjacent to Lake Erie. DOM concentrations (expressed as organic carbon) increased with depth. Number-average molecular weight, weight-average molecular weight, and molar absorptivities (at 280 nm) also increased with depth up to 5 cm and remained relatively constant below this depth. These properties are indicative of the respective changes in the size of the DOM constituents and the number of aromatic moieties present. Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between Fe(II) and DOM, which suggests that both constituents coaccumulate in these pore fluids. It is hypothesized that reduction of iron oxides coated with organic matter releases both DOM and Fe(II). Increases in the molecular weights and molar absorptivities of the DOM constituents suggest that the "sorbed" component released by iron oxide dissolution is composed of larger and more aromatic molecules. The molecular-weight data also suggest that much of the refractory organic carbon in the interstitial waters comprises smaller-than-expected polymeric molecules. Thus, the release of the sorbed organic materials during the reductive dissolution of the oxide phases in anoxic sediments coupled with the selective preservation of refractory organic components may play an important role in both the DOM-mediated fate of pollutants and the cycling of carbon in wetlands.																			0024-3590					SEP	1998	43	6					1287	1296		10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1287	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1287													WOS:000076791700022

Taking Liao River and Estuarine as an example, the pollution characteristics, temporal and spatial distribution and change features of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments in recent 20 years were studied from two different analysis perspectives of land and ocean. The research showed that the pollution of PAHs in the sediments of Liao River and Estuarine was not optimistic. The concentration of sigma(16)PAHs was 48-28,000 ng/g. The carcinogenic risk to humans shouldn't be ignored, which could cause the loss of life expectancy 0.03-4.2 years. The traceability analysis showed that the use and combustion of fossil fuels were the main sources of PAHs. In addition, the leakage of oil during the intensive transportation of ships in coastal waters might also contribute to PAHs. The concentrations of PAHs had obvious temporal and spatial distribution characteristics. Spatially, estuaries < tributaries < main streams; temporally, wet season < normal season < dry season in Liao River. Whereas, the variation of PAHs in estuarine sediments was slight. In the past 20 years, the concentration of PAHs in Liao River had increased first and then decreased, reaching maximum in 2010; However, the concentration of PAHs seldom decreased in estuarine sediments, in which showed a more serious situation of PAHs pollution control.

Geophysical Characterization in the Shallow Water Estuarine Lakes of the Southern Everglades, Florida	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Anthropogenic activities have greatly modified freshwater flows through Everglades National Park (ENP) such that saltwater has intruded extensively inland from the coastline, causing coastal lakes and their ecosystems to be exposed to varying salinity conditions. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) makes an effort to restore the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of freshwater flow in ENP with a goal of reducing salinity conditions within the coastal communities and adjacent estuaries. An understanding of the temporal and spatial variations of surface water and shallow groundwater salinity in the coastal lakes of ENP is needed to evaluate restoration efforts. Geophysical surveys were conducted between 2016 to 2019 using electrical resistivity and electromagnetic (EM) methods in the coastal lakes of ENP. A mean local formation factor of 10.7 +/- 1.8 was calculated for the region by comparing the lakes' bottom formation inverted electrical resistivity soundings with coincident pore water resistivity measured in groundwater wells. The conductivity of surface and groundwater increased during the dry season, reflecting decreased precipitation, increased evapotranspiration, and the increasing influence of saline water from Florida Bay. Spatially, salinity in the lakes increased from west to east in the surface water with an opposite trend observed in the shallow groundwater. Along the south to north inland direction, the salinity of both surface water and groundwater decreased. This study demonstrates that floating electrical resistivity and EM methods can characterize the subsurface formation resistivity and describe temporal and spatial patterns of surface and shallow groundwater conductivity.					; Kiflai, Michael/H-4788-2018	Frankovich, Thomas/0000-0002-3367-9190; Price, Rene/0000-0003-1050-7270; madden, chris/0000-0002-0120-8589; whitman, dean/0000-0002-0300-5777; Kiflai, Michael/0000-0001-7662-4563														2076-3417				FEB	2022	12	3							1154	10.3390/app12031154	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12031154													WOS:000759001200001
J	Tyagi, N; Sahoo, S				Tyagi, Nutan; Sahoo, Santanu			Assessing the status of changing regimes of water bodies in Gorakhpur District, Uttar Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water bodies play a very important role in maintaining and restoring the ecological balance, but they are one of the most threatened habitats in the world. Anthropogenic intervention is changing the regimes of wetlands almost everywhere particularly in the developing countries. Gorakhpur District is dotted with many big and small flood plain-related water bodies like rivers, streams, tanks, dead arms, oxbow lakes, etc. Some of these water bodies are worst affected and are degraded by encroachment for agriculture and other economic and developmental activities. Channel migration, aggravated by human intervention, on alluvial plain is also very frequent, which has direct impact on the nature of water bodies and land use transformations of the region. In this paper, the authors have made an attempt to (a) bring current geographical and historical background of water bodies/wetlands for the district. It aims to assess long-term (1917-2018) and short-term (pre- and post-monsoon) changes in the water bodies of Gorakhpur District; (b) provide changes in the regime of water bodies/wetlands and their conversion to different types of land use/land cover classes due to human intervention and due to annual rainy season, which inundates a large extent of the area every year; (C) assess the channel characteristics and morphometric analysis of main rivers of the region during the last hundred years. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) have been used to prepare the inventory and to perform change detection, using land use/land cover maps. The floodplain areas of water bodies have almost changed their morphological characters due to encroachment by the nearby areas. Canals, drainage channels, and lakes are the most affected water bodies in the region, which have recorded - 65.38% and 43.37% loss in their area. Even permanent rivers have recorded a decrease of - 16.96% in the area. As per the seasonal change, agriculture land suffered the greatest conversion (18.33%) due to floodwater inundation. The study provides a platform to planners to chalk out their policies and also for monitoring the water bodies. Furthermore, analysis on channel migration will help predict the future course of the main rivers.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2022	194	2							67	10.1007/s10661-021-09630-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09630-w								34993684					WOS:000739972500012
J	Weekley, D; Li, XG				Weekley, David; Li, Xingong			Maximizing Multi-Decadal Water Surface Elevation Estimates With Landsat Imagery and Elevation/Bathymetry Datasets	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Identifying patterns and trends in long-term lake dynamics is essential to establish effective water management procedures and boost our understanding of inland water's role in the global water cycle. This research leverages Google Earth Engine to estimate multi-decadal water surface elevations for 52 lakes and reservoirs with varying physical properties. Water surface elevation was estimated using the entire Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 Landsat Top-of-Atmosphere Tier-1 Collection-1 archive from August 1982 through December 2017 via shoreline boundary statistics extracted from the National Elevation Dataset merged with lake bathymetry. Image contamination was identified and removed to provide elevation estimates for images with varying levels of image contamination. To improve accuracy, data filtering techniques were identified which retained over 70% of images with detectable water boundaries producing 26 lakes with sub-meter root-mean-square-error accuracy and 40 lakes with sub-meter mean-absolute-error-accuracy using a general overall parameter model. Additionally, lake-specific locally optimized models were also determined with 45 of the 52 lakes producing sub-meter root-mean-square-error accuracies and 49 with sub-meter mean-absolute-errors with individual lake accuracy as low as 0.191 m RMSE CI95%[0.129, 0.243]. In general, individual lake accuracy is highly correlated with the mean slope of the surrounding terrain with low-slope shorelines having greater accuracy than high-slope shorelines. Seasonal patterns in estimate accuracy were also identified. This research extends our ability to track lake dynamics over long time periods to lakes lacking traditional in-situ monitoring, enables rapid assessment of lake dynamics across large areas, and balances a need for both high-accuracy measurements and maximum temporal resolution.					; 李, 海星/ABE-6456-2021	Weekley, David/0000-0002-4123-6023; ?, ??/0000-0003-1636-2922; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2022	58	2							e2021WR029680	10.1029/2021WR029680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR029680													WOS:000763453500037

Phylogeography of an Australian termite, Amitermes laurensis (Isoptera, Termitidae), with special reference to the variety of mound shapes	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												In northern Australia, the debris-feeding termite Amitermes laurensis builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds in the northern part of Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land, where their habitats are seasonally flooded, and small dome shaped mounds in the southeastern part of Cape York Peninsula, where their habitats are well-drained. Phylogeographic analyses were conducted in 238 individuals from 30 populations using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene. DNA sequences of 50 haplotypes were used to construct NJ, NIP and ML trees. Phylogenetic trees for 16 Amitermes species showed monophyly of A. laurensis and the variation of A. laurensis mounds did not strongly correspond to the intraspecific phylogeny. It was observed that mounds with the same shape were constructed by phylogenetically different groups under similar environmental conditions and different mounds shapes were built by phylogenetically closely related groups under the different environmental conditions. Thus, phylogenetically close groups of A. laurensis, in different habitats, may adapt to environmental conditions by constructing different mound shapes. We also investigated the phylogeographic structure of A. laurensis. The significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances indicated isolation by distance, reflecting restricted dispersal ability of alates. Although the overall genetic structure of A. laurensis showed isolation by distance, we also identified two exceptions: (i) secondary contacts of genetically divergent lineages in southern Cape York Peninsula, and (ii) low genetic differences between geographically separated populations of Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land. Therefore, the phylogeography of A. laurensis may reflect continuous gene flow restricted to short distances and past changes of gene flow associated with the fluctuation of environmental conditions accompanying the changing sea levels in the Quaternary.

J	Paik, IS; Kim, HJ; Lee, YI				Paik, IS; Kim, HJ; Lee, YI			Dinosaur track-bearing deposits in the Cretaceous Jindong Formation, Korea: occurrence, palaeoenvironments and preservation	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												Dinosaur track deposits of the Upper Cretaceous Jindong Formation, Korea, were examined from a sedimentological viewpoint to interpret their palaeoenvironments and conditions of preservation. The general depositional environment of the Jindong Formation was lake-margin to shallow lacustrine. Lake-margin deposits comprise most of it but the stable isotope values of the carbonates suggest an open lake. There are two types of dinosaur track beds. One is a discrete trackway deposit and the other is a dinoturbated deposit. All of the dinosaur trackways in the formation are preserved in interlaminated fine-grained sandstone to siltstone-mudstone deposits, which were deposited on a dry mudflat at the lake margin by sheetfloods and then underwent calcareous pedogenesis. The dinoturbated deposit was originally calcareous silty mud, reflecting deposition in a shallow lake of low energy. It was also modified later by calcareous pedogenesis. The trampling traces of dinosaurs in the Jindong Formation are recognized both on bedding surfaces and in sections. In places dinosaur tracks occur as 'overtracks' which are preserved in layers above the true tracks. The Jindong dinosaur track deposits are usually associated with pedogenic calcretes, which indicates that the climate at the time was seasonal and arid. Consequently, it is interpreted that the extensive and frequent preservation of dinosaur tracks in the Jindong Formation is the result of repeated deposition by sheetfloods on a mudflat associated with a perennial lake, which was utilized by dinosaurs as a persistent water source during drought, and subsequent development of calcareous pedogenesis in an arid climate.

It menders through various coal mining regions is now under serious threats due to industrial and sewage discharge which is rich in TOC, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (primary nutrient plants). Hence, present research work was formulated with the hypothesis of river sediment possess high concentration of primary nutrients which can be used in mine site reclamation. In this regard, spatiotemporal and seasonal variations in concentration of these nutrients were studied to know its sources. Nutrient index of the sediment was assessed to compare its fertility with soil for its utilization in mine site reclamation and pollution control of the river. Study area has momentous spatial variation; Garga river (site 12) carry sewage and effluent from Bokaro steel city having maximum concentration of TOC, available N, and P, while available K was maximum at Chandrapura thermal power plant (site 9). Substantial seasonal and temporal disparity in nutrient concentration was also found. In 2014, TOC (0.82 and 0.5)%, available N (12.3mg/kg and 7.9mg/kg), P (11.3mg/kg and 6.2mg/kg), and available K was (218mg/kg and 201.7mg/kg), respectively, in pre- and post-monsoon. These amplified to 39% for TOC, 19-29% for nitrogen, more than 35% for phosphorus and 2.9-3.9% for K by 2016. The nutrient index was medium for TOC and pH except low in 2014 post-monsoon. Nutrient index for nitrogen was low while high for phosphorus and potassium during the study.

J	Huang, LD; Qiu, W; Xu, XF; Zhang, YS				Huang, Lidong; Qiu, Wen; Xu, Xiangfei; Zhang, Yongsong			Opposite response of phosphorus sorption to pH and ionic strength: a comparative study in two different shallow lake sediments	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Phosphorus (P) sediment sorption is regarded as the most important buffering process against P increases in overlying water. In this study, two shallow eutrophic sediments (Mei and Hua) with distinct compositions were selected to assess effects of pH (from 6 to 9) and ionic strength (IS) (0, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1M KCl) on P sorption. In Mei sediments, the P sorption decreased as pH increased (6.97-9.13), but it increased as IS increased over the pH range in question. These results could be attributed to the negatively charged surface of Mei sediments, as indicated by the salt titration curve, and the high cation exchange capacity (CEC). P sorption in Hua sediments was facilitated by a pH increase (6.12-7.49), but it was hindered by an IS increase. A reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that calcium phosphate precipitates at high pHs and that Cl- exchanges with P because the surface is weakly charged (small CEC). These results indicate that the sediment P sorption may have trends opposite to one another in relation to the salt change (e.g. drought and rainy season) in the lake water between the two sediments. These data provide additional support to explain P concentration variations in lakes.																			0275-7540					AUG 1	2013	29	6					519	528		10.1080/02757540.2013.810726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2013.810726													WOS:000321609200004

Bloom cycles (chlorophyll > 10 mg m(-3)) were observed to evolve over several weeks but on occasion did change rapidly. Total chlorophyll concentration revealed the majority of the lakes did not follow the typical seasonal succession of biomass associated with temperate waters. Particle and chlorophyll concentration maxima did not always coincide, cautioning the use of chlorophyll a as a surrogate for algal biomass. Phytoplankton near the base of the euphotic zone, including a deep chlorophyll maximum in an oligotrophic system, were found to exhibit significant chromatic adaptation. Unique absorption peaks identified the ubiquitous presence of cyanobacteria in all four lakes.

Using a combination of dissection, light, and transmission electron microscopy, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), in situ microelectrode studies, and S-35 isotope incubations, we documented the major differences between wet and dry seasons. During the wet season (precipitation 177 mm), cyanobacterial (green layer) and anoxyphototrophic (pink layer) communities, as well as the black FeS layer were well-developed, and T-RFLP patterns indicated a diverse community. The rate of oxygenic photosynthesis was 49 mu M min(-1). Aerobic respiration was 29 mu M min(-1), and sulfate reduction was 264 nmol cm(-3) h(-1). During the dry season (precipitation 51 mm), cyanobacteria and anoxyphototrophs were less diverse and abundant, and T-RFLP patterns were less complex. The O-2 production rate was reduced to 9 mu M min(-1), as was O-2 consumption (7 mu M min(-1)) and sulfate reduction (26 nmol cm(-3) h(-1)). Aragonite, calcite, halite, and quartz were the predominant minerals. Seasonal differences were found in the green and pink layers for both halite and quartz. Gypsum was not observed, likely due to a sample handling artifact. The fluctuations in community composition and metabolic activity, principally reflected in fluctuations in binding and trapping potential of the uppermost mat community, might be responsible for the observed differences in mineralogy.

J	Naithani, J; Deleersnijder, E; Plisnier, PD				Naithani, J; Deleersnijder, E; Plisnier, PD			Analysis of wind-induced thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												An analysis is presented of the wind-induced thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. The region undergoes a four month dry season and the wet season for the rest of the year. The dry season is characterised by nearly constant high southeasterly winds, while for the rest of the year mild wind blows generally from the northeast. Observations show that the dry season high winds cause tilting of the thermocline, being higher/lower than normal at the southern/northern ends of the lake. The thermocline tries to restabilise itself after the cessation of dry season winds and oscillates for the rest of the year. A non-linear reduced-gravity model is used to study the thermocline oscillations of the lake. The numerical simulations satisfactorily represent the oscillations, their period and amplitude. Different forcing conditions (thermocline depth, wind stress and stability) are used in the model and their effect on the period and amplitude of the oscillations are studied. The amplitude of oscillations ranges from 15 to 45 m, while their period varies from 3 to 4 weeks according to the variation in the model parameters. Wavelet transform is used to study the evolution of periods of oscillations with depth in the time series of observations and along the length of the lake using model simulations. Wavelet spectra presents several dominant modes including the semidiurnal, diurnal, synoptic, intraseasonal variability, besides the modes representing the wind-induced thermocline oscillations.

It has been found that Vembanad Lake contributes significant amount of methane to the atmosphere. Average emissions varied spatially within the lake. Methane emissions were 193.2 +/- 24.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) at Kumaragam (fresh water) as compared to 9.3 +/- 9.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) at Pullot (brackish water) site. Seasonal variation was significant between pre- and post-monsoons. Soil temperature, time of the day, salinity sediment organic carbon, all control the rate of methane emissions from the Vembanad Lake. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The 165 clones studied were grouped into four phylogenetically different clusters, Most of the clones isolated from both the aerobic epilimnion and the sulfide-rich hypolimnion were defined as cluster I, belonging to the Halobacteriaceae family, The three additional clusters were all isolated from the anaerobic hypolimnion. Cluster II is phylogenetically located between the genera il Methanobacterium and Methanococcus, Clusters III and TV relate to two previously documented groups of uncultured euryarchaeota, remotely related to the genus Thermoplasma. No crenarchaeota were found in the water column of the Solar Lake. The archaeal community in the Solar Lake under both stratified and mixed conditions was dominated by halobacteria in salinities higher than 10%. During stratification, additional clusters, some of which may possibly relate to uncultured halophilic methanogens, were found in the sulfide- and methane-rich hypolimnion.

Samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the dry season in standardized surveys of six seasonally isolated lakes and six lakes permanently connected to the river mainstem. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that among the environmental descriptors of lakes, only Secchi transparency and maximum depth were significantly related to fish community structure. Most of the patterned variation in community structure was associated with married seasonal changes in lake transparency (means: early dry season = 90.8 cm; late dry season = 33.2 cm) and depth (means: early dry season = 4.6 m;late dry season = 2.0 m). Visually oriented fishes had highest abundance in clear lakes, whereas fishes with adaptations to low visibility were most abundant in turbid lakes. The type of isolation of lakes from the river channel had no apparent effect on community structure. The results suggest that sensory adaptations for detection of prey under prevailing optical conditions play a major role in the organization of these communities, as predicted by a model of fish community organization originally developed for floodplain lakes of the Orinoco River, Venezuela.

J	Alexander, CR; Windom, HL				Alexander, Clark R.; Windom, Herbert L.			Material Mobilization and Transport in the Anadyr River-Estuarine System, Eastern Siberia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Water and sediments samples collected from the Anadyr River, one of the most pristine Siberian watersheds, and its associated estuarine and coastal region were analyzed for a variety of inorganic constituents, trace metals, and stable and radioisotopes to assess the mobilization and fate of materials transported along this fluvial marine pathway. Sampling campaigns occurred during high and waning river discharge: the former concentrated primarily on the fluvial part of the system and the latter, the estuarine and coastal areas. A major focus of this report is on trace metal geochemistry, but results also address sediment provenance, transport, and deposition. The fluvial concentrations of most of the trace metals analyzed (i.e. Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni) are elevated in thermokarsted areas along the river course because of groundwater inputs to surface waters, presumably resulting from seasonal thawing of permafrost. Further down, river concentrations decrease, most likely because of removal to particles. The estuarine distribution of dissolved trace metals indicates that there is little biogeochemical alteration during their transport through the estuarine/coastal region. Estuarine concentrations of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, U, and Fe are generally conservative with respect to salinity. The estuarine concentrations of the other trace elements studied (Mn, Co, Mo, and V) show no distinct pattern relative to salinity. Pb-210 and Cs-137 activities and trace metal, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and delta C-13 in surface and down-core sediments indicate that the Onemen Bay-Anadyr Bay estuarine system effectively traps particles originating from the watershed and from the Bering Sea. Onemen Bay is dominated by fluvial sources, whereas Anadyr Bay appears to be dominated by particles of a more oceanic provenance.

J	Gelwick, FP; Akin, S; Arrington, DA; Winemiller, KO				Gelwick, FP; Akin, S; Arrington, DA; Winemiller, KO			Fish assemblage structure in relation to environmental variation in a Texas Gulf coastal wetland	ESTUARIES												We described seasonal fish-assemblages in an estuarine marsh fringing Matagorda Bay, Gulf of Mexico. Habitat zones were identified by patterns of fish species abundance and indicator species optima along gradients in salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and depth in our samples. Indicators of the lower brackish zone (lower lake and tidal bayou closest to the bay) were gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) at salinity > 15 parts per thousand, DO 7-10 mg 1(-1), and depth < 0.5 m. Indicators of the upper brackish zone (lake and fringing salt marsh) were pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) at salinity 10-20<parts per thousand>, DO > 10 mg 1(-1), and depth < 0.5 m. In the freshwater wetland zone (diked wetland, ephemeral pool, and perennial scour pool), indicators were sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) at salinity < 5 parts per thousand, DO < 5 mg 1(-1), and depth <greater than or equal to> 1 m. In the freshwater channelized zone (slough and irrigation canal), indicators were three sunfish species (Lepomis), white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) at salinity < 5<parts per thousand>. DO < 5 mg 1(-1), and depth > 1.5 m. In brackish zones, seasonal variation in species diversity among sites was positively correlated with temperature, but assemblage structure also was influenced by depth and DO. In the freshwater zones, seasonal variation in species diversity among sites was positively correlated with depth, DO, and salinity, but assemblage structure was weakly associated with temperature. Species diversity and assemblage structure were strongly affected by the connectivity between freshwater wetland and brackish zones. Uncommon species in diked wetlands, such as tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and fat sleeper (Dormitator maculatus), indicated movement of fishes from the brackish zone as the water level rose during natural flooding and scheduled (July) releases from the diked wetland. From September to July, diversity in the freshwater wetland zone decreased as receding waters left small isolated pools, and fish movement became blocked by a water-control structure. Subsequently, diversity was reduced to a few species with opportunistic life histories and tolerance to anoxic conditions that developed as flooded vegetation decayed.					; Akin, Senol/AAK-8444-2021	Akin, Senol/0000-0002-3851-4360; Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Arrington, Donald/0000-0002-1138-2580													0160-8347					APR	2001	24	2					285	296		10.2307/1352952	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352952													WOS:000169052900013

Three clones (216 and 271[(O-3 tolerant] and 259 [O-3 sensitive]) have been characterized for O-3 sensitivity by growth and biomass responses, foliar symptoms, gas exchange, chlorophyll content, epicuticular wax characteristics, and antioxidant production. In this study we compared the responses of these same clones exposed to O-3 under field conditions along a natural O-3 gradient and in a Free-Air CO2 and O-3 Enrichment (FACE) facility. In addition, we examined how elevated CO2 affected O-3 symptom development. Visible O-3 symptoms were consistently seen (5 out of 6 years) at two of the three sites along the O-3 gradient and where daily one-hour maximum concentrations were in the range of 96 to 125 ppb. Clonal differences in O-3 sensitivity were consistent with our OTC rankings. Elevated CO2 (200 ppm over ambient and applied during daylight hours during the growing season) reduced visible foliar symptoms for all three clones from 31 to 96% as determined by symptom development in elevated O-3 versus elevated O-3 + CO2 treatments. Degradation of the epicuticular wax surface of all three clones was found at the two elevated O-3 gradient sites. This degradation was quantified by a coefficient of occlusion which was a measure of stomatal occlusion by epicuticular waxes. Statistically significant increases in stomatal occlusion compared to controls were found for all three clones and for all treatments including elevated CO2, elevated O-3, and elevated CO2 + O-3. Our results provide additional evidence that current ambient O-3 levels in the Great Lakes region are causing adverse effects on trembling aspen. Whether or not elevated CO2 in the future will alleviate some of these adverse effects, as occurred with visible symptoms but not with epicuticular wax degradation, is unknown.

J	Mack, GH; Leeder, M; Perez-Arlucea, M; Bailey, BDJ				Mack, GH; Leeder, M; Perez-Arlucea, M; Bailey, BDJ			Early Permian silt-bed fluvial sedimentation in the Orogrande basin of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, New Mexico, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Lower Permian (Wolfcampian) Abo Formation of south-central New Mexico was deposited by a silt-dominated fluvial system along the western half of the Orogrande basin a few degrees north of the equator in western Pangaea. Fluvial channel deposits consist primarily of. (1) inclined siltstone stratasets up to 4.5 m thick and 25 m wide interpreted as point bar deposits, and (2) symmetrically infilled siltstone stratasets up to 2.4 m thick and 14 m long that may represent avulsion crevasse channels. Both types of channels are dominated by climbing ripple cross-laminae and plane bed laminae, but trough cross-beds are also present, as are several types of soft-sediment deformation structures and desiccation cracks. Red silty mudstones interpreted as floodplam deposits comprise up to 70% of the formation and are interbedded with thin (< 2 m) tabular siltstone beds of crevasse-splay/levee origin, as well as rare lacustrine carbonates (similar to 0.5 m thick) and structureless siltstones (< 1 m thick) interpreted as loessites. Common pedogenic features in floodplain strata and on the tops of some fluvial channel beds include root traces, peds, and calcic nodules/tubules, whereas gypsum, gley colour mottling, and translocated clay and/or iron oxides are rare. Also present is an ichnofauna dominated by opportunistic arthropods that colonized the moist upper surfaces of recently deposited crevasse-splay/levee beds and the uppermost surfaces of fluvial channels following avulsion. The relative abundance of channel and crevasse-splay/levee deposits increases eastward in response to moderate asymmetrical subsidence of the basin, whereas calcic paleosols are more numerous on the more slowly subsiding western margin of the basin. A semi-arid to sub-humid palaeoclimate with seasonal precipitation favoured relatively deep rivers whose point bars were seasonally exposed, the formation of calcic and vertic soils, a sparse ichnofauna and flora, periodic desiccation of small carbonate lakes, and perhaps reworking of loess from the floodplain and/or upstream catchments.

J	Murase, J; Sakai, Y; Sugimoto, A; Okubo, K; Sakamoto, M				Murase, J; Sakai, Y; Sugimoto, A; Okubo, K; Sakamoto, M			Sources of dissolved methane in Lake Biwa	LIMNOLOGY												The spatial distribution and seasonal variation in the concentration and carbon isotopic composition of dissolved methane in a river-lake ecosystem were studied in Lake Biwa, Japan, and its tributary rivers. Methane concentrations in all subsystems examined were supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. The epilimnion showed higher concentrations of dissolved methane than the hypolimnion in the pelagic zone. Peak methane concentrations were observed at the thermocline. The largest amount of methane in the pelagic water column was recorded at the end of a stagnant period, at which the bottom water of the sublittoral zone (30m in depth) exhibited increased methane concentration. Transect observation of dissolved methane revealed three methane peaks at different water depths in the lake, and river water and the sediments in littoral and sublittoral zones were suggested to be the corresponding sources. Water at the river mouth was replete with dissolved oxygen but also contained a high concentration of methane. The present results suggest that river water and littoral sediment are potential sources of dissolved methane in Lake Biwa, and other sources, such as internal waves, are responsible for increased methane in the pelagic zone at the end of stagnant periods. Carbon stable isotope analysis indicated that there were different sources of dissolved methane, although it was difficult to identify the origins due to high variation of the isotopic composition of methane from different sources.																			1439-8621					AUG	2003	4	2					91	99		10.1007/s10201-003-0095-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0095-0													WOS:000185183700004
J	Bush, MB; Miller, MC; De Oliveira, PE; Colinvaux, PA				Bush, MB; Miller, MC; De Oliveira, PE; Colinvaux, PA			Two histories of environmental change and human disturbance in eastern lowland Amazonia	HOLOCENE												Two long palaeoecological records (pollen, diatoms, C-14, chemistry and charcoal) provide a detailed record of Holocene environmental conditions in the lowlands of the lower Amazon. Changes in the composition of the terra firme forest are evident but a forest cover is maintained throughout. Fluctuations in lake level and changes in seasonality are tracked in both sedimentary sequences. Rising early-Holocene sea levels and the consequent rise of local water tables probably caused the flooding of one of the sites. A stepped increase in precipitation is suggested with increases evident at 8800 yr BP, 7400 BP and between 6100 and 5800 yr BP. Increased storminess is suggested between similar to 7400 yr BP and similar to 6100 yr BP. Human disturbance is manifested in the palaeoecological records at one study site as early as 5500 yr BP (c. 6500 years ago), and an intensification, or onset, of agriculture is evident at c. 3350 yr BP. The terminating phase of the long record of disturbance is a period of forest regrowth that may correlate to the depopulation of Amazonia following European contact.					; De Oliveira, Paulo/B-4559-2017	Bush, Mark/0000-0001-6894-8613; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2000	10	5					543	553		10.1191/095968300672647521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968300672647521													WOS:000088581400001

We posited that CR=BR+phytoplankton respiration (PR)+zooplankton respiration (ZR). Based on the results of independent experimental series, PR was estimated as 0.3 x gross primary production (GPP) and GPP as 1.5 x PCF. ZR was determined by multiplying zooplankton carbon biomass, measured biweekly, with published respiration rates for major zooplankton groups. From these data, we calculated BR and consequently BGE, determined as BP/(BR+BP). Over the entire study period, BR averaged 49 (+/- 10)% of CR and was consistently higher during the first half of the year. Semi-annual averaged BGE ranged from 26% to 53%, mean 39 (+/- 9)%. Similar values of BGE were obtained if we did not use the measured values for ZR, but estimated BR+ZR from CR-PR and then assumed that BR ranged from two to three times ZR. The approach outlined in this paper can be useful for determining BGE in aquatic systems where long-term data sets of PCF, CR and BP are available.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR	2010	71	3					351	363		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00822.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00822.x								20041950					WOS:000274163000003

Lakes were predominated by Oscillatoriales: Planktothrix agardhii in one lake and Limnothrix spp. in the other two lakes. Considerable populations of Nostocales occurred in two of the lakes prior to mass developments of Oscillatoriales. The lake predominated by P. agardhii differed from the lakes predominated by Limnothrix spp. by higher total phosphorus concentrations and a larger surface area. Phosphorus is discussed as the crucial factor in the competition between Oscillatoriales, with P. agardhii as the stronger competitor under higher phosphorus concentrations. Both Oscillatoriales outcompeted Nostocales populations under a declining intensity of PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). The decline of PAR intensity was promoted by the cyanobacteria itself and had a positive feed back on the development of Oscillatoriales but a negative effect on the development of Nostocales populations. Furthermore, the presence and concentration of microcystin was related to the presence and biovolume of P. agardhii, respectively. No microcystins were found when only Limnothrix spp. were present.																			0003-9136					OCT	2002	155	3					383	400																WOS:000179384900003

The lightning flashes issued from WorldWide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) allow to contribute in highlighting some characteristics in agreement with the literature. Some new findings, that can be useful for future storm monitoring thanks to lightning data issued from the Lightning Imager (LI) onboard Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), have been noted and have to be confirmed with more case studies. Thus, a seasonal correlation is found between the daily flash number and the extent of large CAPE values. The lightning flash density exhibits the same location of its maximum, for December and March with about 3 and 2 flashes km(-2), respectively. This location is also reported in the literature for the annual activity in the study area. The storm developments often occur in the regions that combine the presence of lakes and mountains. The flash clusters allow to localize the strong convective activity and to follow the displacement of the storm systems when they move. The flash rate density (FRD) is larger in the convective systems well organized, as the typical MCS, during the development of the storms and when several cells merge. The daily cycle shows a lightning flash rate maximum between 14:00 and 15:00 UT that precedes the maximum development of the storm by one hour. It also shows that the storms that occur within the region of the main maximum of lightning activity, are more frequent and produce larger values of FRD.

SP (22 degrees 15' S and 47 degrees 49' W). Interviews (total 1,027) with sport fishers were accomplished in the three main fishing sites (Horto, Pier and Praia). This fishing was practiced with a simple fishing rod and reel. mainly in Horto, where the catches and fishing effort were higher. The catches were mainly composed of Cichlidae (Geophagus brasiliensis. Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia rendalli and Cichla monoculus). We tried to determine which factors (fishing sites, type of baits and season) and the covariate fishing effort, expressed in number of fishing rods Multiplied by fishing time, would affect catches, using a 3 way-ANCOVA. The final model showed that only fishing sites and effort determined the captures of sporting fishing in the reservoir. Some measures for managing fishing practices are discussed.					; Filho, Rinaldo/L-7493-2013	Antonio Ribeiro Filho, Rinaldo/0009-0006-9771-588X; Petrere Jr, Miguel/0000-0003-2000-6699													1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2008	68	4					721	731		10.1590/S1519-69842008000400006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842008000400006								19197489					WOS:000262904500006

Trait sorting in Daphnia colonising man-made lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We used a zooplankton metacommunity to ask how dispersal, genetic drift and selection act to determine the local and regional distributions of trait variation. Since the formation of the lakes 80 years ago, cladoceran species have sorted into local assemblages that cluster by lake depth. Given this species sorting, we ask whether intraspecific variation in an ecologically important phenotypic trait body size has sorted as well. 2. We quantified changes in body size through time by measuring ephippia from D.similar to pulicaria, D.similar to dentifera and D.similar to ambigua recovered from sediment cores from two lakes. We then estimated mean body size of contemporary populations of two competing species, Daphnia pulicaria and D.similar to dentifera, in a laboratory common garden experiment. Finally, we used microsatellite loci to characterise genetic diversity and gene flow among local sites in the metacommunity. 3. Body size was variable both within and among years for the three species of Daphnia examined using sediment cores. For two lakes where we examined body size distributions through time, we observed a significant shift in body size of the first species to arrive after colonisation by other Daphnia species, which suggests selection has occurred historically. 4. Despite heritable variation in body size in the laboratory, evidence for trait sorting was only found for D.similar to pulicaria, which was larger in deeper lakes. Mean body size varied among lakes, but did not sort relative to depth for D.similar to dentifera. 5. Microsatellite data indicated that neutral genetic diversity was low in the region; only 27% of the individuals assayed were unique multi-locus genotypes. We also found significant patterns of isolation by distance for both species. However, population structure was stronger in D.similar to dentifera than in D.similar to pulicaria. Hence, we conclude that a limited number of colonists have successfully invaded this metacommunity, and those genotypes arriving in this new region have experienced significant dispersal limitation among local sites. 6. Overall, while dispersal and selection have clearly led to the development of predictable community assemblages related to depth in this metacommunity, the distribution of phenotypic traits within species can differ substantially even between two trophically similar species. Our results highlight the complex roles of colonisation history, dispersal, selection and stochasticity in determining inter- and intra-specific patterns in metacommunities.

The population has been classified as near-threatened due to overexploitation and possible hybridization with the lake-spawning sparsely rakered whitefish form. Thus, knowledge of habitat use, movements, and migrations is important for threat assessment and management decisions. We employed conventional tagging and acoustic telemetry to provide information on movements and home range of the Koitajoki River whitefish. We tagged mature individuals at their spawning areas and followed fish movements by tag recoveries and continuously recording fixed receiving stations. The maximum movement distances were 40-50 km both upstream and downstream from the releasing site. There were indications of a clear seasonal migration pattern and spawning-site fidelity; riverine habitats were mainly occupied for spawning and overwintering, while feeding and growth mainly took place in lacustrine environments within several lakes of the river system. Due to their migratory nature, whitefish is vulnerable to environmental disturbances and overfishing in a large geographic area.

Seasonal variation in the hydrolytic exo-enzyme profile of Vibrio sp associated with the marine benthic environment of South India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Benthic sediment samples, from both east and west coast of peninsular India were evaluated for the different species of vibrios and their exoenzyme profile. About 800 isolates of Vibrio sp. were isolated and screened for hydrolytic exoenzymes. More than 91% of isolates showed multiple extracellular enzyme profile, synthesizing more than two hydrolytic enzymes. Hydrolytic exoenzyme production was more active during monsoon season. Among the species of vibrios, V. furnissi (30%) was dominant, followed by V. harveyi (23.75%), V. neries (15%) and V parahaemolyticus (11.25%). Vibrios from the benthic environment were a markedly diverse group playing an important role in mineralization process in the benthic environments.

Mercury speciation and exchanges at the air-water interface of a tropical artificial reservoir, French Guiana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The distribution and speciation of mercury (Hg) in air, rain, and surface waters from the artificial tropical lake of Petit-Saut in French Guiana were investigated during the 2003/04 period. In the air, total gaseous mercury (TGM) at the dam station averaged 12 +/- 2 pmol m(-3) of which > 98% was gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). GEM distribution depicted a day-night cycling with high concentrations (up to 15 pmol m(-3)) at dawn and low concentrations (down to 5 pmol m(-3)) at nightfall. Reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) represented < 1% of the GEM with a mean concentration of 4 3 fmol m(-3). Diel RGM variations were negatively related to GEM. In the rain, the sum of all Hg species in the unfiltered (HgTUNF) averaged 16 +/- 112 pmol L-1. Temporal distribution of HgTUNF exhibited a pattern of high concentrations during the late dry seasons (up to 57.5 pmol L-1) and low concentrations (down to 2.7 pmol L-1) in the course of the wet seasons. Unfiltered reactive (HgRUNF), dissolved gaseous (DGM) and monomethyl (MMHgUNF.) Hg constituted 20, 5 and 5% of HgTUNF, respectively. All measured Hg species were positively related and displayed negative relationships with the pH of the rain. In the reservoir surface waters, dissolved total mercury (HgTD) averaged 3.4 +/- 1.2 pmol L-1 of which 10% consisted of DGM. DGM showed a trend of high concentrations during the dry seasons (480 +/- 270 finol L-1 and lower (230 +/- 130 finol L-1) in the course of the wet seasons. Diel variations included diurnal photo-induced DGM production (of about 60 firiol L-1 h(-1)) coupled to minute to hour oxidation/ reduction cycles (of > 100 firiol L-1 amplitude). Finally, calculated atmospheric Hg inputs to the Petit-Saut reservoir represented 14 mot yr(-1) whereas DGM evasion reached 23 mol yr(-1). Apportionment among forms of Hg deposition indicated that up to 75% of the total Hg invasive flux follows the rainfall pathway. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Aukema, BH; Clayton, MK; Raffa, KF				Aukema, BH; Clayton, MK; Raffa, KF			Modeling flight activity and population dynamics of the pine engraver, Ips pini, in the Great Lakes region:: effects of weather and predators over short time scales	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Ascertaining the relative effects of factors such as weather and predation on population dynamics, and determining the time scales on which they operate, is important to our understanding of basic ecology and pest management. In this study, we sampled the pine engraver Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and its predominant predators Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Histeridae) in red pine plantations in Wisconsin, USA, over 2 years. We sampled both the prey and predators using flight traps baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromone of I. pini. Flight models were constructed using weather variables (temperature and precipitation), counts of bark beetles and their predators, and temporal variables to incorporate possible effects of seasonality. The number of I. pini per weekly collection period was temperature dependent and decreased with the number of predators, specifically T. dubius in 2001 and P. cylindrica in 2002. The number of predators captured each week was also weather dependent. The predators had similar seasonal phenologies, and the number of each predator species was positively correlated with the other. Including a term for the number of prey did not improve the model fits for either predator for either year. Our results suggest that exogenous weather factors strongly affect the flight activity of I. pini, but that its abundance is also affected by direct density-dependent processes acting over weekly time scales. Adult predation during both colonization and dispersal are likely processes yielding these dynamics.																			1438-3896					APR	2005	47	1					61	69		10.1007/s10144-004-0202-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-004-0202-z													WOS:000229109900008

Breb UTEX 1444, a cyanobacterial strain that produces high levels of siderophores under iron limitation. Various chelators of greatly varying affinity for Fe3+ (HEDTA, EDDHA, desferrioxamine mesylate, HBED, 8-hydroxyquinoline) were assayed for the degree of iron acquisition by iron-limited cyanobacterial cells. Iron uptake rates (measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry) varied approximately inversely with calculated [Fe3+] (calculated as pFe) and decreased with increasing chelator-to-iron ratio. No iron uptake was observed when Fe3+ was chelated with HBED, the strongest of the tested chelators. Iron-limited Anabaena cells were able to take up iron from 8-hydroxyquinoline (oxine or 8HQ), a compound sometimes used to quantify aquatic iron bioavailability. Iron bound to purified humic acid was poorly available but did support some growth at high humic acid concentrations. These results suggest that for cyanobacteria, even tightly bound iron is biologically available, including to a limited extent iron bound to humic acids. However, iron bound to some extremely strong chelators (e.g. HBED) is likely to be biologically unavailable.

In this paper the results of measuring campaigns and a comparison of radon levels observed in the hilly area north of the town and on the pre-Alps are reported. The general criteria of the measurements and the interpretative models of radon concentration are presented. The Lake Maggiore area shows evidence of a great nocturnal stability and frequent formation of Nocturnal Stable Layer. The peculiar findings in the high altitude stations confirm the use of radon as an indicator of atmospheric dispersion of pollutants in an area with complex orography. The afternoon minimum values are concordant for the different stations: this implies a remixing in afternoon hours over the whole area investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The seston biomass of over 500 samples was analyzed by HPLC to assess microcystin content. The highest microcystin content per dry weight was found when Planktothrix rubescens was dominant, followed by Planktothrix agardhii and Microcystis spp. The microcystin to chlorophyll-a ratio mostly varied between 0.1 and 0.5, with maxima of 1-2. In over 70% of the samples from pelagic water, particulate microcystin concentrations were below 10 mu g L-1. By contrast, spatial and temporal concentrations varied by 4 orders of magnitude (2-25,000 mu g L-1) at bathing sites in 1997 during a mass development of Microcystis sop. The seasonal peak of development of Microcystis spp. occurred from June to September and of Planktothrix agardhii from September to November. Planktothrix rubescens, however, was almost perennial. The seasonal levels of these cyanobacteria were clearly reflected by microcystin concentrations in the water bodies. (C) 1999 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Usually, several seismic stations are required to detect, characterize, and locate volcanic tremors, which can be difficult in remote areas or low-income countries. In these cases, alternative techniques have to be used. Here, we apply a data-reduction approach based on the analysis of three-component seismic data from two co-located stations operating in different times to detect and analyze long-duration tremors. We characterize the spectral content and the polarization of 355 long-duration tremors recorded by a seismic sensor located 9.5 km SE from the active vent of Copahue volcano in the period 2012-2016 and 2018-2019. We classified them as narrow- (NB) and broad-band (BB) tremors according to their spectral content. Several parameters describe the characteristic peaks composing each NB episode: polarization degree, rectilinearity, horizontal azimuth, vertical incidence. Moreover, we propose two coefficients C-P and C-L for describing to what extent the wavefield is polarized. For BB episodes, we extend these attributes and express them as a function of frequency. We compare the occurrence of NB and BB episodes with the volcanic activity (including the level of the crater lake, deformation, temperature, and explosive activity) to get insights into their mechanisms. This comparison suggests that the wavefield of NB tremors becomes more linearly polarized during eruptive episodes, but does not provide any specific relationship between the tremor frequency and volcanic activity. On the other hand, BB tremors show a seasonal behavior that would be related to the activity of the shallow hydrothermal system.

Consequently, a trap-and-transfer programme has been implemented to allow silver (migratory) eels access to the sea. The present study analysed data on the timing of captures and numbers of silver eels over four seasons, including the influence of possible migration cues. Silver eels were captured over an extended season of seven months (November-May), with peak numbers during December and January. Flow at the lake outflow was found to have a weak relationship with the number of eels caught, as did lake level, but moon phase and rainfall had no significant effect. These results highlight the variability in silver longfin eel behaviour both in terms of timing and response to potential environmental cues.

J	Håkanson, L; Gyllenhammar, A; Brolin, A				Håkanson, L; Gyllenhammar, A; Brolin, A			A dynamic compartment model to predict sedimentation and suspended particulate matter in coastal areas	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This paper presents a new dynamic mass-balance model for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sedimentation in coastal areas handling all important fluxes of SPM to, from and within coastal areas, as such areas can be defined according to the topographical bottleneck method. The model is based on ordinary differential equations and the calculation time (dt) is one month to reflect seasonal variations. An important demand, related to the practical utility of the model, is that it should be driven by variables readily accessed from standard monitoring programs or maps. Added to the dynamic core model are several (static) empirical regressions for standard operational effect variables used in coastal management, such as the Secchi depth, the oxygen saturation in the deep water, and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The obligatory driving variables include four morphometric parameters (coastal area, section area, mean and maximum depth), latitude (to predict surface water and deep water temperatures, stratification and mixing) and Secchi depth or SPM-concentrations in the sea outside the given coastal area. The model is based on four compartments: two water compartments (surface water and deep water; the separation between these two compartments is done not in the traditional manner from temperatures but from sedimentological criteria, as the water depth separating transportation areas from accumulation areas) and two sediment compartments (ET-areas, i.e., erosion and transportation areas where fine sediments are discontinuously being deposited, and A-areas, i.e., accumulation areas where fine sediments are continuously being deposited). The processes accounted for include inflow and outflow via surface and deep water, input from point sources, from primary production, from land uplift, sedimentation, burial (the transport of matter from surficial A-sediments to underlying sediments), resuspension, mixing and mineralization. The model has been validated with good results (the predictions of sedimentation are within the 95% confidence limits of the empirical data used to validate the model) against data collected by sediment traps placed in 17 Baltic coastal areas of different character. The paper also presents sensitivity and uncertainty tests of the model. The weakest part of the model concerns the sub-model to predict the ET-areas. Many of the structures in the model are general and have also been used with similar success for other types of aquatic systems (mainly lakes) and for other substances (mainly phosphorus, radionuclides and metals). We also present approaches to indicate how the model could be modified for coastal areas other than those included in this study, e.g., for open coasts, estuaries or areas influenced by tidal variations.

Temporal dynamics of soil erosion and rainfall erosivity as geoindicators of land degradation in Northwestern Argentina	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The subtropical region of Northwestern Argentina displays severe environmental deterioration due to a combination of factors, including seasonally contrasting weather, highly erodable loessic soils, a topography with varied slopes, and natural vegetation coverage restricted by deforestation and agricultural advance, in addition to exploitation of natural resources by people. The aim of the present research was to determine the landscape degradation, using as geoindicators the increase in erosion by water and the pluviometric gradient variations through time. Two regions were chosen as sample areas in the province of Tucuman: the eastern foothills and plain of the Southeastern Ranges (Western Chaco); and the intermountain valley of Tafi. Erosion increase was quantified by measuring the length of gullies and ravines; and the sedimentation in the artificial lake (La Angostura) located in the center of the valley of Tafi. Climate changes were analyzed by means of the rainfall erosivity variations in both sample areas during the last 30 years. The lineal increase in erosion is closely related to the pluvial dynamics. Nevertheless, this erosive intensification is also dependent on the interaction of environmental factors and human activities (deforestation, land use changes, unrestricted agriculture).

When delta(15)N values were used to estimate trophic levels, analyses of about 500 individual fish collected in two seasons at five sites showed that trophic level varied from 2 (herbivore) to 4.3 (second-level carnivore) among the 29 fish species examined. Lower trophic levels predominated among small fish caught at a littoral marsh site, and highest trophic levels were found among larger offshore fish. Marsh fish showed about three times the C isotope variation than did offshore fish, consistent with the wider array of foods in the marsh versus offshore food web. Ln addition to these community-level results, there were often unexpected large isotopic differences between individuals in almost all fish species examined, suggesting large differences in individual feeding behavior. Isotopic analyses indicate long-term differences in feeding among individuals, in addition to the short-term differences often observed in stomach content studies. Long-term individual variation in fish foraging may be important in understanding variation in other biochemical parameters measured in fish, such as Hg or PCB contents.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014; Fry, Brian/A-8321-2013	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0706-652X					APR	1999	56	4					590	600		10.1139/cjfas-56-4-590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-4-590													WOS:000081027900007

While the abundance and diversity of small lakes undermine the former approach, application of global models often biases estimations due to uncertainties of atmospheric correction. Here, we introduce a regional approach wherein local in situ data from select waterbodies is used to retrieve Chla in nearby lakes. We trained semi-empirical (SE) and machine-learning (ML) algorithms, namely 2band, LMDN, and SVR, over four ice-free seasons (2017-2020) using 193 pairs of near-surface Chla in Buffalo Pound Lake, Canada, and near-coincident satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance from Sentinel-2. Ability of locally trained models and a globally trained mixture density network (MDN) to retrieve Chla for unseen data (N = 50) was evaluated for six other catchment lakes. Regional approaches based on locally trained ML models (SVR, LMDN) unbiasedly estimated Chla in test sites (overall error approximate to 60%) and outperformed locally trained SE models and globally trained ML models (reduced error by 20%, bias by 50%). These findings suggest that ML-based regional models are capable of expanding regional Chla retrieval from optically-similar waterbodies.

Organic compounds and heavy metals from anthropogenic activities in the watershed have contaminated the river. Sample from the upper layer of the sediment from Saguling Lake were taken from 12 locations, representing the dry and the rainy seasons in the period 2015-2018. Sediment cadmium (Cd) classification was conducted through a sequential extraction technique to determine Cd's bioavailability and its risk to the water environment. During the rainy season, the total Cd concentration in the upper layer of the sediment was higher than during the dry season. The average dry and rainy season concentrations were 11.12 +/- 2.16 mg/kg and 14.82 +/- 1.48 mg/kgm in the sampling locations, distributed differently with the following order of the largest to the smallest concentration: 10B > 1A > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1B > 10A > 7 > 9 > 5 > 6 > 8 for the dry season, and 4 > 1A > 1B > 2 > 7 > 5 > 9 > 3 > 6 > 10A > 8 > 10B for the rainy season. All sampling locations (>6O%) showed Cd in the resistant fraction, indicating no significant anthropogenic input of Cd into the surface sediment but more geological input due to high erosion. The values of RAC, ICF, and GFC indicate that the Cd in the surface sediment can be categorized as low risk.

These two genera were distinguished by the presence of stalks in the Achnanthes genus and their absence in Achnanthidium. Before electron microscopy, the difference between Achnanthes and Achnanthidium was not clear, especially in Achnanthidium minustissimum sensu lato. The aim of the study is to describe three new species of Achnanthidium from Lake Salda. Material and methods - Lake Salda is located in southwestern Anatolia, in Turkey. The diatoms were collected seasonally from four stations in the lake between 2016 and 2020, from different substrata (epipelic, epiphytic, and epilithic). Key results - Three new species belonging to the genus Achnanthidium have been found in Lake Salda, Turkey. Based on the morphological observations, all new taxa are part of the Achnanthidium minutissimum complex. Achnanthidium barlasii sp. nov. and A. dumlupinarii sp. nov. show a high degree of similarity to each other, but can be separated based on valve outline and a denser areolation, especially in striae close to the apices of the raphe valve. Both species can be distinguished from A. minutissimum based on more separate apices and less elliptic valves. In the case of A. dumlupinarii sp. nov., large specimens show slight undulations of the valve, which is a unique feature. Achnanthidium anatolicum sp. nov. is the most characteristic based on its valve width, broadly rounded valve apices, and almost straight valves in girdle view. All newly described Achnanthidium species can be found in lentic environments, with alkaline water and high calcium ion content. Conclusion - The newly described taxa occurred in the unique habitat of a soda lake. The environment of the lake is highly alkaline, rich in magnesium and calcium, and derived from limestone and dolomitic limestone rocks.

Total species richness was 5 (Prevalence = Haemobartonella sp. 63.1 %, Bartonella grahamii 27.4 %, Hepatozoon erhardovae 31.4 %, Trypanosoma evotomys 15 degrees, and Babesia microti 1.0 % ) with 81.9 %, of the voles carrying at least 1 species and a mean infracommunity; species richness of 1 1. Variation in species richness was determined primarily by season and year, and the interaction of these factors. The observed frequency distribution of intracommunity species richness did nor differ from that predicted by a null model, suggesting that there were no marked associations between the species. Analyses of prevalence and abundance of infection with each species in turn, revealed that overall the principal causes of variation were temporal and seasonal and their interaction, intrinsic factors such as age and sex playing only a miller role. However,. the relative importance of specific extrinsic, and rarely intrinsic, factors varied and was distinct for each of the species in the study. Prevalence data revealed 1 sets of 2-way associations between en species, most varyingly dependent on combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Analysis of quantitative associations suggested 4 sets of positive 2-way interactions, 3 of which remained after controlling for the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the abundance of each species, but only one could be unequivocally accepted (Haemobartonella sp. + B. grahamii) after correction for multiple comparisons. These data are discussed in the context of the changing ecological profiles in this region of Eastern Europe and, in a wider context, in relation to current understanding of the factors which shape component community structures of haemoparasites in wild rodents.

J	Veira, A; Jackson, PL; Ainslie, B; Fudge, D				Veira, Andreas; Jackson, Peter L.; Ainslie, Bruce; Fudge, Dennis			Assessment of background particulate matter concentrations in small cities and rural locationsPrince George, Canada	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												This study investigates the development and application of a simple method to calculate annual and seasonal PM2.5 and PM10 background concentrations in small cities and rural areas. The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) and 2.5 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and between 6.3 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) and 8.5 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia. Implications: In rural areas like northern British Columbia, particulate matter (PM) monitoring stations are usually located close to emission sources and residential areas in order to assess the PM impact on human health. Thus there is a lack of accurate PM background concentration data that represent PM ambient concentrations in the absence of local emissions. The background calculation method developed in this study uses observed meteorological data as well as local source emission locations and provides annual, seasonal and precipitation-related PM background concentrations that are comparable to literature values for four out of six monitoring stations.

Patterns of Dissolved Oxygen, Productivity and Respiration in Old Woman Creek Estuary, Erie County, Ohio during Low and High Water Conditions	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Old Woman Creek wetland is composed of a stream and freshwater estuary and may act as a sink or transformer of nutrients entering Lake Erie. Primary productivity and respiration are indicators of ecosystem level trophic conditions and may be linked to the estuary's effectiveness as a nutrient sink or transformer. Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve has been collecting water chemistry data at 15 minute intervals using data loggers since 1995. Both diel and seasonal trends in water temperature, dissolved oxygen and water depth at selected sites in the creek and estuary were related to physical and biological processes. Daily primary productivity and respiration were estimated from diurnal changes in dissolved oxygen under both high and low water conditions. Mean water depth was higher in 1997 and 1998 (0.94-1.2 m) than in 2003 and 2004 (0.5-0.66 m). Water temperature was generally 1-2 degrees C higher in the open lower estuary and mouth than in the creek and upper estuary which is more shaded. Typical diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen ranged from less than 20% to greater than 150% saturation. Primary productivity rates in the creek and upper estuary were lower (0.5-3-5 gO(2)/m(2)/day) than in the lower estuary sites (2.0-10.1 gO(2)/m(2)/day). Through both periods of high water and low water, the GPP/R ratio was less than one, thus negating our hypothesis that the ratio would be greater than 1 during high water years when the estuary was primarily an open water system.																			0030-0950					JUN	2008	108	3					31	43																WOS:000269671800002
J	Park, JS; Wade, TL; Sweet, S				Park, JS; Wade, TL; Sweet, S			Atmospheric deposition of organochlorine contaminants to Galveston Bay, Texas	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric monitoring of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides (e.g., HCHs, chlordanes, and DDTs) in Galveston Bay was conducted at Seabrook, Texas. Air and wet deposition samples were collected from 2 February 1995 and continued through 6 August 1996. Vapor total PCB (tPCB) concentrations in air ranged from 0.21 to 4.78 ng m(-3) with a dominance of tri-chlorinated PCBs. Dissolved tPCBs in rain ranged From 0.08 to 3.34 ng l(-1), with tetra-chlorinated PCBs predominating. The predominant isomers found in air and rain were alpha- and gamma -HCH, alpha- and gamma -chlordanes, 4,4 ' -DDT, and dieldrin, The concentrations of PCBs and pesticides in the air and rain revealed no clear seasonal trend. Elevated levels of PCBs in the air occurred when temperatures were high and wind came from urban and industrialized areas (S, SW, NW, and W of the site). Concentrations of HCHs were elevated in April. May, and October, perhaps due to local and:or regional applications of gamma -HCH (lindane). Other pesticides showed no notable temporal variation. When winds originated From the G ulf of Mexico (southeasterly), lower concentrations of organochlorines were detected in the air. The direct deposition rate (wet + dry) of PCBs to Galveston Bay (6.40 mug m(-2) yr(-1)) was significantly higher than that of pesticides by a factor of 5-10. The net flux from gas exchange estimated for PCBs was from Galveston Bay water to the atmosphere (78 mug m(-1) yr(-1)). Gas exchange of PCBs from bay water to the atmosphere was the dominant flux.

Can interactive data visualizations promote waterfront best management practices?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Ward NK, Sorice MG, Reynolds MS, Weathers KC, Weng W, Carey CC. 2022. Can interactive data visualizations promote waterfront best management practices? Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Lake water quality management often requires private property owner engagement since land-use change generally occurs on private property. Educational components of lake management outreach must connect current property owner behaviors with future water quality. However, it may be challenging for property owners to associate their current behaviors with water quality outcomes due to the time lag between a behavior (e.g., fertilizer application) and a water quality outcome (e.g., decreased water clarity). Interactive data visualizations, characterized by user-determined selections that change visualization output, may be well suited to help property owners connect current behavior to future water quality. We tested the effectiveness of an online, interactive visualization as an educational intervention to alter property owners' perspectives related to applying lawn fertilizer and installing waterfront buffers. We used cognitive psychology measures to quantify intervention effectiveness. Since property owners' decision making may be driven by connections to their property, we also explored relationships between seasonal and permanent residents and intentions to apply fertilizer or install waterfront buffers and intervention effectiveness. Despite no significant difference in effectiveness between the interactive and noninteractive versions, the combined responses demonstrated a positive shift in behavioral beliefs and intentions related to lawn fertilizer application and waterfront buffer installation. Seasonal residents were less likely than permanent residents to apply lawn fertilizer before the intervention and more likely to shift their intentions after the intervention. This study provides evidence that brief educational interventions-regardless of their interactivity-can shift private property owner beliefs and intentions regarding lakefront property management.					; Sorice, Michael/JZT-5057-2024; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Weng, Weizhe/0000-0001-8821-4406; Weathers, Kathleen/0000-0002-3575-6508; Ward, Nicole Kristine/0000-0001-7549-0153; Sorice, Michael/0000-0001-9865-0965													1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2022	38	1					95	108		10.1080/10402381.2021.2021335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.2021335		DEC 2021											WOS:000756330500001
J	Davies, AL; Watson, F				Davies, Althea L.; Watson, Fiona			Understanding the changing value of natural resources: an integrated palaeoecological-historical investigation into grazing-woodland interactions by Loch Awe, Western Highlands of Scotland	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We aim to compare fine resolution pollen data from a former seasonal pasture with historical evidence for grazing and woodland use. We discuss the complexities and benefits of integrating qualitative and quantitative information, and the implications for studies of past wood-grazing interactions and their relevance to current conservation management. Location Corries is an abandoned farm township in Scotland's Western Highlands. Methods Two sources were used: (1) pollen evidence from a former seasonal pasture, analysed at c. 20-year intervals and dated using C-14 and Pb-210, provides a c. 1100-year local vegetation and land-use history; (2) written sources document resource regulation and changing socio-economic circumstances at local to national scales over the last c. 400 years. Results Each source records woodland and livestock management at different spatial and temporal scales: written evidence provides a clearer understanding of general (estate) rather than farm-scale changes, while small pollen basins record localized woodland-grazing dynamics, which can be difficult to extrapolate to the landscape scale. Both sources indicate a dynamic wood-grazing balance and together provide clearer evidence for incentives and drivers controlling this relationship. The first palynological phase of woodland incursion (AD c. 1210-1490) pre-dates the surviving written records, but a second (AD c. 1680-1760) occurs during a period of increasing market value for cattle, when farmers may have increased grazing despite regulations to protect woods. The site is not representative of grazing intensification associated with the introduction of extensive sheep farming because the farmer protected the woods (AD c. 1760-1880) until they were cleared (AD c. 1880-1920) for quarrying (AD 1885-1904), which accounts for the limited palynological evidence for grazing. Main conclusions Written evidence for past stocking levels is too fragmentary and ambiguous to allow long-term quantitative analysis, but a local historical context is important for interpreting local pollen records. Management decisions that determined grazing-woodland interactions were shaped by changing values, markets, agricultural practices and regulatory structures, which can result in nonlinear relationships between stocking levels and woodland continuity. Many woods were managed for multiple purposes in the past and promoting natural processes or pursuing pre-anthropogenic baselines will result in the erosion of cultural features that have shaped present landscape values.

J	Tajabadi, M; Zare, M; Alijani, F				Tajabadi, Mehdi; Zare, Mohammad; Alijani, Farshad			Unstable convection flow as a controlling process of increasing salinity in the saline lake coastal aquifers: case of Maharlu Lake coastal aquifer	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Deterioration of freshwater aquifers adjacent to saline lakes is a serious environmental and water resources management problem. Generally, different phenomena including saltwater intrusion, upconing, free and forced convection flow can lead to the salinization of fresh aquifers in the vicinity of saline lakes. The severity of this problem depends on hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions of coastal saline lake aquifers. Accordingly, Maharlu Lake in the southeast of Shiraz plain is one of these saline lakes and has an important impact on its adjacent fresh aquifers so that the salinity of these aquifers has increased in recent years. Since the lake has special conditions such as very flat and low permeable floor and variable water level fluctuation during a year, with the onset of the rainy season after a long-term well pumping in the adjacent aquifer, the lake water covers a wide extent of the lake area in a short time. Then, because of the higher permeability of the surface of the lake in its southeast margin, conditions for convection flow are provided there. In this study, salinity distribution in one of the aquifers (Bokat aquifer) in the southeast of the lake is investigated using resistivity tomography along several profiles. Interpretation of inverse models of these profiles showed that convection flow is an important process in increasing the salinity of fresh aquifer. Comparison of the results of geotomography sections with convection index map of the Bokat aquifer showed that getting closer to the lake, free convection flow becomes the dominant process in the salinity distribution. In addition, in farther distances relative to the lake, due to increasing the pumping rate of the extraction wells, forced convection flow is an important process.

Seasonal variability in the abundance of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) recorded using hydroacoustics in Windermere, UK and its implications for survey design	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					International Conference on Conservation and Management of Arctic Charr	JUN 30, 2004	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	Royal Soc Edinburgh, Scottish Nat Heritage & English Nature				Hydroacoustic surveys are an important tool for assessing the abundance of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in lakes, the requirement for which is increasing because of new environmental legislation. Consequently, survey demand is now such that assessments must be undertaken with the minimum of effort compatible with scientific validity. One major complication is seasonal variability in abundance, with which surveyors have attempted to deal by defining somewhat arbitrary seasonal sampling windows. The definition of more objective windows was pursued by analysing variations in the seasonal abundance of Arctic charr in Windermere, UK, recorded using day and night hydroacoustic surveys at monthly intervals from 1991 to 2001. Two alternative sampling windows for night surveys free of significant internal seasonal effects were revealed, i.e., December to September and September to December. It was also found that day surveys gave a useful, although lower, estimate of abundance as compared with night surveys.

J	Erbilgin, N; Raffa, KF				Erbilgin, N; Raffa, KF			Association of declining red pine stands with reduced populations of bark beetle predators, seasonal increases in root colonizing insects, and incidence of root pathogens	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Declining red pine, Pinus resinosa (Aitman), stands in the Great Lakes region appear to arise from a complex of biotic and abiotic factors. We monitored stem and root colonizing beetles in declining and healthy plantations in Wisconsin from 1997 to 1999. We also conducted systematic field excavations and laboratory isolations of various root pathogens, Multiple funnel traps were baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromones of the two most common bark beetle (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) species in the region, Ips pini (Say) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff). Lower-stem flight traps were baited with 1:1 (+)-alpha-pinene:75% ethanol, and pitfall traps were baited with 1:1 (-)-alpha-pinene:75% ethanol. Healthy stands had higher populations of predators, particularly Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Histeridae), and Platysoma parallelum Say than declining stands. Seasonal abundance patterns of predators and Ips also varied between declining and healthy stands. Declining stands had higher numbers of Ips and lower numbers of predators early in the season, whereas healthy stands had higher predator populations in the early season. Declining stands had more lower stem infesting bark beetles Dendroctonus valens LeConte (Scolytidae) and weevils (Curculionidae) Pissodes spp. Surprisingly, healthy stands had more root weevils, Hylobius pales (Herbst) and Hylobius radicis Buchanan, and root bark beetle Hylastes porculus Erichson, over the entire season. However, spatial by temporal patterns again were important. Populations of root colonizing insects were higher in healthy stands early in the season, but higher in declining stands throughout much of the ovipositional period. These results suggest dispersal patterns and overwintering behaviors are important in the interactions among herbivores, predators, and host plant condition in Red Pine Decline. The principal fungi isolated from roots were Leptographium procerum (Kendr.) Wingfield and Leptographium terebrantis Barras & Perry. These were more prevalent in declining than healthy stands. Staining fungi were more frequently isolated from roots of trees at the pocket margin than from trees in the asymptomatic portion of declining stands. Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref, was not isolated from root samples or stem disks, despite 40% recovery in positive controls using the latter method. Likewise, Armillaria spp. were not associated with declining plantations. Our results further support the view that forest declines are due to complex interactions among multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, and exhibit particular spatial and temporal patterns.

Ecological Characterization of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) at the Southern Coast of Mar Chiquita Lake, Argentina	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												In the southern coast of Mar Chiquita Lake, central Argentina, mosquitoes affect public health and community livelihood, since they transmit pathogens to human beings causing diseases such as malaria, filariasis, encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue, among others, and have a negative effect on cattle farming as well. To characterize the structure of the mosquito assemblage of the region, we determined the species composition and diversity, the temporal distribution of different species, and the patterns of species richness, abundance, and diversity across seasons. We collected adult mosquitoes over a two-year period (October 2004-September 2006) by means of CDC light traps baited with CO2 from 18:00 to 08:00 h during the warm season (October-April) and from 12:00 h to 18:00 h in the cold season (May-September). A total of 71,501 individuals from 30 species were collected, with Culex Linnaeus and Aedes Meigen genera representing more than 98% of collected specimens (61.5% and 37.3%, respectively). The higher values of richness and abundance of Culicidae were registered in warm seasons compared to cold seasons. Chao(1) estimates suggested that more than 90% of the species were detected in all seasons. Mosquito abundance distribution fit the logarithmic series and log-normal models. Aedes albifasciatus (Macquart), Ae. scapularis (Rondani), Culex interfor Dyar, Cx. saltanensis Dyar, and Cx. dolosus (Lynch Arribalzaga), vectors incriminated in arbovirus transmission, were abundant year-round, with Cx. saltanensis and Cx. dolosus most prevalent in cold seasons. Further studies are needed to assess the role of these species in arbovirus transmission in this region of central Argentina.

Water resource assessment along the Blue Nile River, north Africa with a one-dimensional model	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT												The water resource of the Blue Nile River in north Africa is under increasing pressure due to rapid population growth and economic development. The situation is aggravated by a lack of coordinated management and governance, partly caused by incomplete knowledge of the water supplies, uses and needs. Proper water management is particularly important now, considering the recently completed and planned mega dams on the Blue Nile River network. This paper reports on the construction of a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model covering the entire Blue Nile River system, from Lake Tana to the confluence with the White Nile, with the aim of quantifying water availability throughout the year, for different conditions. The work included an extensive field measurement campaign along the Blue River and its tributaries, both in Ethiopia and Sudan. Calibrated and validated with independent datasets, the model was used to quantify water uses in the period 2008-2010, which were then compared with the official figures. The results show that the dry season is characterised by extra water losses that should be taken into account when quantifying water needs, especially during the filling up phase of new reservoirs.

The applying the data to the equation W = aL(b), yielded a = 6.648 x 10(-6) and b = 3.0217. Weight residuals fluctuate during the fishing season, likely due to conditions of the fish, probably associated with gonad development. Additionally, the equations including maximum girth (G, cm) W = aG(b) and W = a(L x G)(6) were fitted using a subset of record fish totalling 186 specimens. Comparison of the equations W = aL(b) and W = aG(b) showed that weight was better described by maximum girth (AIC = 624.9) rather than by length (AIC = 690.0), but the best fit was obtained with the equation W = a(L x G)(b) (AIC = 566.3) with the parameters a = 2.426 x 10-3 and b =					; Milardi, Marco/ACZ-4214-2022; Lappalainen, Jyrki/IAM-3496-2023	Lappalainen, Jyrki/0000-0002-4631-3788; Milardi, Marco/0000-0001-6104-294X; 													0003-455X	1797-2450				JUN 30	2014	51	3					335	339		10.5735/086.051.0305	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.051.0305													WOS:000338391600005
J	Goel, A; McConnell, LL; Torrents, A				Goel, A; McConnell, LL; Torrents, A			Wet deposition of current use pesticides at a rural location on the Delmarva Peninsula: Impact of rainfall patterns and agricultural activity	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Event-based precipitation samples were collected during the main agricultural season (April-September) over 4 years (2000-2003) at one site in the Choptank River Watershed on the Delmarva Peninsula. The samples were analyzed for 19 agricultural pesticides to determine the contribution of wet deposition as a source of these compounds to the Chesapeake Bay and the factors affecting the temporal trends in deposition. Chlorothalonil was detected most frequently (92% samples) followed by metolachlor (66%) and endosulfans (49%). Although chlorothalonil is the single biggest contributor to pesticide flux (33-46%), pesticide wet deposition is dominated by herbicides (46-61%), with the greatest fluxes occurring during the time of herbicide application on corn and soybeans. The analysis suggests that the extent of wet deposition of herbicides depends on the timing of precipitation relative to herbicide application. The insecticide and fungicide flux was greater in years with above-average rainfall (2001 and 2003), suggesting that for these pesticides deposition flux is dependent on the total amount of rainfall in the agricultural season. The data indicate that the use of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide which is on the Toxics of Concern list for the Bay, is on the increase. Total pesticide flux ranged from go mu g/m(2) (2001) to 180 mu g/m(2) (2000). Wet deposition can account for up to 10-20% of the annual loadings of pesticides to the Bay.

Three paleoenvironmental phases are distinguished for the last 10,000 yr. The interval between 10,000 and 7000 yr B.P. shows gaps in sediment deposition in four sites and xerophytic vegetation in three other sites attesting to dry climatic conditions. The exception is one site located in the polar advections trajectory where moist and cold conditions are recorded. Influence of polar air masses was not taken into account in paleoclimatic model predictions. Between 7000 and 4000 yr B.P. a more seasonal climate is recorded. Moisture levels increased, attested by the development of swamp vegetation, semi-deciduous forest and gallery forest; respectively. This implies that polar advections probably were weakened. Between 4000 and 0 yr B.P. modern climatic conditions became established, shown by the development of cerrado vegetation to the north, semi-deciduous forest in the center and Araucaria forest to the south. Polar fronts remained restricted to their present day position between 25 and 30 degrees S latitude. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Raeder, U; Ruzicka, J; Goos, C				Raeder, Uta; Ruzicka, Johannes; Goos, Cornelia			Characterization of the light attenuation by periphyton in lakes of different trophic state	LIMNOLOGICA												In order to measure the attenuation of light by periphyton a method has been developed which assures that natural periphyton architecture and therefore its optical characteristics remain preserved. This method has been applied to analyze the transmittance of periphyton of four lakes of different tropic states situated in the Osterseen Lake District (Upper Bavaria, Germany). The seasonal variation of the periphyton's transmittance has been studied using standard microscope glass slides exposed 1 m beneath the water surface within macrophyte beds. The study ran from February to November 1997 in two eutrophic lakes (Lake Waschsee, Lake Sengsee) and from May to November 1997 in the meso-oligotrophic Lake Eishaussee and in the oligotrophic Lake Herrensee. Generally the exposure-period, the seasonality, and the tropic state of the habitat affected the transmittance spectra of the periphyton. In all lakes the attenuation by periphyton increased with longer colonization times but at a different time scale. The periphyton of the nutrient-rich and the nutrient-poor lakes differed clearly in composition and architecture. The eutrophic lakes were characterized by a relatively thick but loosely attached, unstable periphyton community, which was translucent to a certain degree even at the end of the growth period. The transmittance of this periphyton fluctuated considerably and high percentages of filamentous green algae in this periphyton contributed to attenuation maxima within the range 400-500 nm and 650-700 nm due to photosynthetic pigments. By contrast, the periphyton of the meso-oligotrophic and of the oligotrophic lake was quite compact and nearly impervious to light. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Distribution, status and conservation of the Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis in Cambodia	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												The Bengal Florican is a 'Critically Endangered' bustard (Otididae) restricted to India, Nepal and Southern Indochina. Fewer than 500 birds are estimated to remain in the Indian subcontinent, whilst the Indochinese breeding population is primarily restricted to grasslands surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle Sap region (19,500 km(2)). During 2005/06 and 2006/07 we systematically sampled 1-km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were detected within 90 1-km squares at a mean density of 0-34 males km(-2) which, accounting for unequal Survey effort across grassland blocks, provides a mean estimate of 0.2 males km(-2). Based on 2005 habitat extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333-502 +/- 95% CI), more than half of them in Kompong Thorn province. Tonle Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28% grassland cover within 10 grassland blocks between January 2005 and March 2007. Based on Mean 2005 population densities the remaining grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of 30% since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km(2) of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for biodiversity and local livelihoods. Conservation activities in these areas include participatory land-Use zoning, patrols reporting new developments to government officials, awareness-raising and incentive-led nest protection schemes.					; Dolman, Paul/AAK-3914-2020; Evans, Tom/HSG-2356-2023; Gray, Thomas/AAK-6800-2020	Dolman, Paul/0000-0002-9340-2791; 													0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2009	19	1					1	14		10.1017/S095927090800765X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095927090800765X													WOS:000264692000001
J	Howk, F				Howk, Forrest			Changes in Lake Superior ice cover at Bayfield, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This research documents a 150-year record pertaining to the duration of closed navigation for Bayfield harbor. Data were gathered recording the opening and closing of navigation in Bayfield, Wisconsin from 1857-2007. Data were primarily collected from the Madeline Island Ferry Line and microfilmed copies of the Bayfield County Press. Analysis of the data indicates that the duration of ice cover on Lake Superior at Bayfield, Wisconsin has decreased over the past 150 years at the rate of approximately 3 days/decade or 45 days over the course of the study. During the past 150 years, the date that the last boat is able to navigate in the Bayfleld harbor indicates the onset of ice cover. This date has occurred an average of 1.6 days later every decade. Conversely, the date that the first boat is able to navigate in Bayfield harbor marking the break up of ice cover has come to an average of 1.7 days earlier every decade. Although this represents the overall trend for the past century and a half, the most dramatic changes have occurred since 1975. During this period the ice season has begun an average of 11.7 days later and ended 3.0 days earlier every decade. Bayfield's ice season was compared to the lake's annual maximum ice concentration (AMIC) as compiled in a study by [Assel, R.A., Cronk, K., and Norton, D. 2003. Recent trends in Laurentian Great Lakes ice cover, Climatic Change 57: 185-204, 2003.] The fraction of the potential closed navigation season that the Bayfield harbor is ice covered decreased at a rate of 0.77% a year while the AMIC decreased at a rate of 0.39%/year during the period from 1964-2001. In general, the decline in the ice cover at Bayfield mirrors the pattern shown by the AMIC, suggesting that Bayfield's ice season could be used as a nonspecific indicator of overall lake trends.

Forty metazooplankton species were identified in Lake Wulihu, 37 in Meiliang Bay, and 34 in the central open water area. The annual average abundance of metazooplankton was 218 ind. l(-1) in the central open water area, 309 ind. l(-1) in Meiliang Bay, and 384 ind. l(-1) in Lake Wulihu. In Lake Wulihu, rotifers, Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus angularis, were the dominant species, which contributed 20.9% and 17.2% to the total metazooplankton abundance. Bosmina coregoni and Ceriodaphnia cornuta were the dominant species, contributing 20.4% and 11.3% of the total in Meiliang Bay, and contributing 21.6% and 16.2% of the total in the central open water area. There was a significant positive relationship between rotifers abundance and Secchi transparency. Cladoceran and copepod abundance were positively correlated with total phosphorus and water temperature. Our results show that structures of metazooplankton community differ between the three lake areas with different eutrophic states in Lake Taihu.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2009	150	1-4					445	453		10.1007/s10661-008-0243-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0243-4								18437517					WOS:000263159900037

Permafrost Dynamics and Degradation in Polar Arctic From Satellite Radar Observations, Yamal Peninsula	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												We investigate permafrost surface features revealed from satellite radar data in the Siberian arctic at the Yamal peninsula. Surface dynamics analysis based on SRTM and TanDEM-X DEMs shows up to 2 m net loss of surface relief between 2000 and 2014 indicating a highly dynamic landscape. Surface features for the past 14 years reflect an increase in small stream channels and a number of new lakes that developed, likely caused by permafrost thaw. We used Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to measure permafrost surface changes. Owing to limited observation data we analyzed only 2 years. The InSAR time-series has detected surface displacements in three distinct spatial locations during 2017 and 2018. At these three locations, 60-120 mm/yr rates of seasonal surface permafrost changes are observed. Spatial location of seasonal ground displacements aligns well with lithology. One of them is located on marine sediments and is linked to anthropogenic impact on permafrost stability. Two other areas are located within alluvial sediments and are at the top of topographic elevated zones. We discuss the influence of the geologic environment and the potential effect of local upwelling of gas. These combined analyses of InSAR time-series with analysis of geomorphic features from DEMs present an important tool for continuous process monitoring of surface dynamics as part of a global warming risk assessment.					; Teshebaeva, Kanaiym/AAD-2126-2022; Dolman, Albertus/B-8552-2012; Kovalevskaya, Nelley/B-1226-2016	Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457; van Huissteden, Jacobus/0000-0001-7730-2793; Teshebaeva, Kanayim/0000-0001-7931-6937														2296-6463				DEC 17	2021	9								741556	10.3389/feart.2021.741556	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.741556													WOS:000738840600001
J	Iliescu, D; Baker, I				Iliescu, Daniel; Baker, Ian			The structure and mechanical properties of river and lake ice	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The purpose of this paper is to relate the mechanical behaviors of seasonal lake and river ice to their grain structures. It is shown that for the lake ice the grain structure, and resulting mechanical properties, vary through the thickness of the ice and depend on the proximity to the shores and water inlets. The mechanical behavior of this natural ice is compared to that of S2 ice under similar loading conditions both in terms of strength and fracture mode. We conclude that while fracture models and strengths inferred from tests performed on laboratory-grown S2 ice can be used to provide strength estimates for accretion river ice, their use for the bulk of most lake ice covers is problematic due to microstructural differences between the two kinds of ice.

Seasonal samples from an oligotrophic alpine take (Redon, Pyrenees) mostly included species of chlysophytes, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes and chlorophytes. The chlorophyl a (Chl a) corresponding to each algal group was estimated using HPLC pigment analyses and the CHEMTAX program. Chl a estimates and biovolume showed a significant correlation for all the groups during the ice:free season except for chlorophytes. However, some of the samples from the initial phase of the ice cover presented a clear departure from the relationship during the ice:free period in most groups. On the other hand, the ratios between a specific marker pigment and the biovolume of the marked algal group were significantly constant within the photic zone (>1% surface irradiance) for most of the pigments and groups, including chlorophytes. Nevertheless, the ratios increased and showed a large variability for samples below the photic depth or below the ice cover. The violaxanthin-chrysophyte biovolume ratio presented an opposed tendency to other pigment-biovolume ratios, which increased in inverse proportion to the depth of the sample. The results are discussed in terms Of methodological limitations, acclimation responses and species composition.

Combustion-derived PAHs are most abundant in the Upper Triassic and late Lower Jurassic sediments. The abundances of land-plant-derived markers ail maximise in the upper part of the Lower Jurassic section, but vary independently of one another through time. The changes in the relative abundances of these markers have been related to the variation of regional climatic conditions, especially the changes in humidity and seasonality during the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic times.

J	Knudsen, R; Amundsen, PA; Klemetsen, A				Knudsen, R; Amundsen, PA; Klemetsen, A			Inter- and intra-morph patterns in helminth communities of sympatric whitefish morphs	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Infection patterns of trophically transmitted helminth parasites were compared with feeding ecology in two sympatric whitefish Coregonus lavaretus morphs from two lake systems in northern Norway. In both lakes, the pelagic morph was an obligate zooplanktivore, while the benthic morph utilized both the benthivore and zooplanktivore trophic niches. The differences in niche utilization between the two morphs were associated with differences in trophic morphology (gill raker numbers), suggesting that they were genetically dissimilar and reproductively isolated. The benthic morph had the highest number of helminth species, probably because they exhibited a broader niche width compared to the pelagic morph. In both lakes, the species composition and intensities of helminths reflected the trophic diversification of the whitefish ecotypes with respect to different habitat choice (benthic v. pelagic) and dietary specialization (benthivore v. zooplanktivore feeding strategies within the benthic whitefish morph). Zooplanktivorous fish from both morphs acquired parasites mainly from pelagic copepods and in almost equal quantities. The benthivore feeders within the benthic morph had the highest proportion of parasites with transmission stages from benthic organisms. Host feeding behaviour seemed to be a major determinant of the helminth community structure, and helminths appeared to be useful indicators of long-term trophic specialization of whitefish ecotypes.

Their structure and function are explained by its history, geomorphology, climate, nutrient rich soils drainages, and by man-produced modifications in land and water use. These characteristics explain, the high biomass of its biotic communities. A synchronous analysis, during the peak of the growth season, permits the discrimination of two types within the large lakes of permanent character: a) with relatively low phytoplankton biomass and abundant development Of aquatic macrophyte, and b) with abundant development of phytoplankton but scarce macrophyte development. The first type coincides with what is known as "clear" lakes, of waters relatively transparent and high abundance of large piscivorous fishes. Most of them are in the Pampa grasslands. The second type coincides with green, "turbid" lakes, with high abundance of visual planktivorous fishes. An increased relative abundance of filter feeding planktivores is noticeable in "highly turbid" lakes impacted by organic waste discharges. The shallow lakes were not completely "clear" or "turbid". Rather, a continuous distribution between definitely "clear" and "turbid" lake states was found. The relative abundance of "turbid" lakes is greater in zones with higher intensity of land use. The high temporal variability for the Pampa landscape is seen reflected in the operation of the lake ecosystem. The interaction of climatic factors and land use also would explain the non-periodic changes in the typology of a given lake.

Biogeochemistry and paleoclimate variability during the Holocene: a record from Mansar Lake, Lesser Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Investigation of biogeochemistry and amino acids on a 30-m-long core from Mansar Lake has thrown light on palaeoclimate variability during the Holocene period. The C/N ratio between 6 and 10 with some deviations and delta 13C mostly between -20 and -22aEuro degrees in the shallow core, as well as a C/N ratio greater than 13 reaching from 19 to 20 and correspondingly lower delta 13C of -28aEuro degrees in the deeper core suggest an aquatic source of carbon in the former and a cellulose-rich land plant source in the latter. This is supported by the abrupt increase in organic carbon content in the deeper core compared to the shallow core, which indicates a hot and wet climatic regime during the early Holocene and dry and cold during the late Holocene period. The amino acid data AA-C/C% and AA-N/N% are higher in shallow sediments compared to deeper sediments, indicating an aquatic plant source in the shallow core and greater supply of land plant sources in the deeper core. The lower percentage of the non-protein amino acids beta-alanine (ALA) and gamma-amino-butyric acid in the shallow core compared to the deeper core indicates different sources of organic matter in the lake basin. The higher amino acid ratio Asp/beta-Ala (16.99 av.) and Glu/gamma-Aba (18.18 av.) in the shallow core and lower ratios (10.32 and 12.41 av.) in the deeper core, and Asp/Glu (1.52 av.) and beta-Ala/gamma-Aba (1.61 av.) ratios in the former, which are potential indicators of the nature of the organic matter, are higher in the shallow core relative to the deeper core (1.33 and 1.23 av.), indicating relative biodegradation of organic matter in deeper sediments. It has been observed that the organic matter associated with the dry season is relatively less biodegraded, as evidenced from their higher ratios, and is more biodegraded in the wet season as their ratios are lower in the river sediments. In the absence of a bacterial contribution of organic matter from the soil source in this lake, since Mansar Lake is a non-drainage type, it is envisaged that the climatic variation may be responsible for biodegradation in the deeper core sediments. Therefore, the C/N ratio and delta 13C values supported by amino acid data, the latter being significant in revealing primary productivity and a terrestrial source of organic matter, suggest a hot and wet climatic regime during the early Holocene (ca. 7580 bp) and a dry and cold in the late Holocene period (ca. 4050 bp).

J	Gimenes, MR; dos Anjos, L				Gimenes, Marcio Rodrigo; dos Anjos, Luiz			Quantitative Analysis of Foraging Habitat Use by Ciconiiformes in the Upper Parana River Floodplain, Brazil	BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY												The aim of this study was to analyze the seasonal variations in habitat selection and abundance of Ciconiiformes species in four foraging habitats (rivers, channels, connected and disconnected lagoons) on the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, and to conduct the surveys of wading birds in 2002 and 2003. The largest number of species and highest abundances of most species were observed in the connected lagoons. Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), Roseate Spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and Jabirus (Jabiru mycteria) frequently used connected lagoons (habitat with the highest fish abundance) and abandoned the areas during floods, suggesting that they were able to find high quality patches for foraging. Cocoi Herons (Ardea cocoi), Great Egrets (Ardea alba), and Rufescent Tiger-Herons (Tigrisoma lineatum) used habitats with lower fish abundance and did not totally abandon these areas during floods, suggesting they were not dependent on high quality patches. Differences in foraging techniques and social behavior explained the difference between the two groups. The results showed that opportunism did not totally explain the foraging habitat selection and in low water level seasons there were higher differences in foraging behavior among the species.					dos Anjos, Luiz/F-9501-2012	dos Anjos, Luiz/0000-0002-8680-2375													1516-8913					MAR-APR	2011	54	2					415	427		10.1590/S1516-89132011000200025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132011000200025													WOS:000289856600025
J	Oseguera, LA; Alcocer, J; Vilaclara, G				Oseguera, Luis A.; Alcocer, Javier; Vilaclara, Gloria			Relative importance of dust inputs and aquatic biological production as sources of lake sediments in an oligotrophic lake in a semi-arid area	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The dustfall (DF) and mass sedimentation rate (MSR) in Lake Alchichica, Central Mexico, were studied from June 2006 to June 2008. DF ranged between 0.11-0.93 g m(-2) d(-1) in the warm and rainy season and 0.54-1.21 g m(-2) d(-1) in the cold and dry season. MSR varied from 0.52-2.40 g m(-2) d(-1) in the stratification season to 1.14-5.07 g m(-2) d(-1) in the circulation season. The timing of the highest fluxes of DF and MSR is most likely a product of several factors coinciding during the cold and dry season: (a) availability of dust sources and the presence of strong winds (>7.5 m s(-1)) in the DF case, and (b) the circulation period of the lake and the availability of nutrients in the MSR case. As expected, the DF in Alchichica was high and similar to that found in other arid and semi-arid areas. However, the MSR was higher than that reported for other oligotrophic lakes. Particles captured in the aerial traps consisted mainly of detrital minerals; in contrast, particles found in the water traps were mostly biogenic and, to a lesser extent, detrital minerals. The MSR was one to seven times higher than the DF. In spite of the oligotrophic status of Lake Alchichica, the large size of the settled phytoplankton (autochthonous, waterborne) is what leads to the high MSR, which surpasses the DF (allochthonous, airborne) derived from whirlwinds originating in easily eroded terrains that are characteristic of arid/semi-arid areas. Our results indicate that caution must be taken in considering that the DF amount measured through DF collectors located at the lake shore does actually represent the DF entering into the lake.

J	Wahlström, E; Persson, L; Diehl, S; Byström, P				Wahlström, E; Persson, L; Diehl, S; Byström, P			Size-dependent foraging efficiency, cannibalism and zooplankton community structure	OECOLOGIA												To examine size-dependent food web interactions in systems with cannibalism, we compared the abundances of zooplankton and phytoplankton over 2 years in four lakes with cannibalistic perch (Perca fluviatilis ) of which two also supported the top predator pike (Esox lucius). The abundance of perch 2 years and older was lower in lakes with pike than in lakes with only perch. In contrast, the abundance of small perch (young-of-the-year and I-year old) was lower in lakes with only perch suggesting that intense cannibalism reduced these size classes to low levels in lakes lacking pike. Functional response experiments with differently sized perch and zooplankton showed that the attack rate of small perch susceptible to cannibalism was much higher than that of large cannibalising perch. The optimal body size of perch with respect to attack rate was also lower for small zooplankton prey than for large zooplankton. The zooplankton communities in lakes with only perch were dominated by the relatively small species Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and Bosmina spp. and total zooplankton biomass was higher in these lakes than in lakes with both pike and perch. In contrast, the mean size of cladoceran zooplankton was largest in lakes with both pike and perch owing to a dominance of the large zooplankton species Holopedium gibberum in these lakes. We relate these patterns to (1) the low foraging efficiency of large perch on small zooplankton and (2) the low abundance of small zooplanktivorous perch (due to cannibalism) in lakes with only perch. The differences in zooplankton community structure also resulted in different seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton between lakes. Cannibalism introduces a vertical heterogeneity to food webs that causes consumer-resource dynamics that are not predictable from linear food chain models.

J	Sharp, ZD; Cerling, TE				Sharp, ZD; Cerling, TE			Fossil isotope records of seasonal climate and ecology: Straight from the horse's mouth	GEOLOGY												Isotope analysis of a bulk fossil tooth gives a "snapshot" impression of paleoclimatic conditions-a single point in time, However, hypsodont teeth grow over a period of a gear or more, so that stable carbon and oxygen isotope variations along their length are a "tape recorder" of shortterm seasonal variations from the distant past. We have used a new in situ micro-laser sampling method to determine submillimeter carbon and oxygen isotope variations in the enamel of individual fossil horse teeth to assess ancient annual meteoric water variations and feeding patterns, The delta(18)O values from a 6.8 Ma fossil horse tooth (Astrohippus ansae) from Texas vary cyclically along the 6 cm length of the tooth with a smoothed amplitude of >4 parts per thousand, similar to the monthly averaged amplitude measured in modern meteoric waters from the region, The seasonal delta(18)O values are similar to 3 parts per thousand to 4 parts per thousand higher than those calculated from modern meteoric water data, suggesting either a higher local meteoric water value in the Miocene of Texas, or that the animal received a high proportion of its dietary water from plants or highly evaporated water. A Holocene horse tooth from the shores of Glacial Lake Agassiz, North Dakota (Equus sp.), also has isotopic variations with the same 35 mm periodicity, but a smoothed amplitude of only 2 parts per thousand. This horse most likely had a buffered drinking supply. The calculated delta(18)O of the water in equilibrium with this tooth is the same as the modern measured annual average. The variations within a single tooth can be as large as those generally observed in entire stratigraphic sections of fossil teeth analyzed by bulk methods. The new method provides an important technique for evaluating fossil diagenesis; conventional bulk analyses of teeth fragments may not be representative of the whole tooth, thus explaining analytical scatter that has been previously attributed to diagenesis.

M.; Kim, Kichan			Soil mineral availability and human mineral status: A review and evidence from Malawi	APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY												We review literature demonstrating that soil zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) deficiencies drive human Zn and Se status in some developing contexts, largely through reducing local crop Zn and Se concentration. We then illustrate that in Malawi, human Se status is higher on calcareous soils (the only soils growing high-Se crops) and close to lakes (which hold Se-rich fish). We also show that human Se status is predicted by the soil type surrounding and lake proximity of one's nearest market. This makes sense, since Malawians depend heavily on crops from market, particularly during lean season when Se status was measured.

This paper describes a geospatial streamflow modeling system which is parameterized with global terrain, soils and land cover data and run operationally with satellite-derived precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets. Simple linear methods transfer water through the subsurface, overland and river flow phases, and the resulting flows are expressed in terms of standard deviations from mean annual flow. In sample applications, the modeling system was used to simulate flow variations in the Congo, Niger, Nile, Zambezi, Orange and Lake Chad basins between 1998 and 2005, and the resulting flows were compared with mean monthly values from the open-access Global River Discharge Database. While the uncalibrated model cannot predict the absolute magnitude of flow, it can quantify flow anomalies in terms of relative departures from mean flow. Most of the severe flood events identified in the flow anomalies were independently verified by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) and the Emergency Disaster Database (EM-DAT). Despite its limitations, the modeling system is valuable for rapid characterization of the relative magnitude of flood hazards and seasonal flow changes in data sparse settings.					; Pervez, Shahid/F-9163-2015	Asante, Kwabena Oduro/0000-0001-5408-1852; Pervez, Md Shahriar/0000-0003-3417-1871													1571-5124	1814-2060					2008	6	3					233	241		10.1080/15715124.2008.9635351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2008.9635351													WOS:000212509200005

Water chemistry of three Himalayan Lakes: Dal (Jammu & Kashmir), Khajjiar (Himachal Pradesh) and Nainital (Uttarakhand)	HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY												A comparative study of major elements composition (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl-) and nutrients (PO43-, NO3-, SiO2) of Dal Lake (Jammu & Kashmir), Khajjiar Lake (Himachal Pradesh) and Nainital Lake (Uttarakhand) situated in the Himalayas is discussed in the present work. All the three lakes are important tourist destinations and are characterized by varied lithology and land use. High total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, bicarbonate, sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the Nainital lake and the Dal lake reflect anthropogenic inputs in the form of sewage from surrounding areas, houseboats, hotels, etc. Total dissolved solid (TDS) concentrations are high in Nainital Lake followed by Dal Lake and Khajjiar Lake. The major ion chemistry of all the three lakes is dominated by carbonate source rock weathering. The lakes are characterized by high nutrient concentrations. Water quality index (WQI) determined for two of the lakes (Nainital and Dal) indicate high pollution index. The samples were collected during one season and hence the discussion pertains to the period of sampling only.					, purushothaman/ACS-7864-2022; PATRA, ASHOK/AAI-4898-2020	Patra, Ashok/0000-0003-0513-2267; , purushothaman/0000-0001-9439-8408; 													0971-8966						2008	29	1					63	72																WOS:000252500400006

Viral and bacterial abundances were studied in relation to environmental attributes over an annual period, for both planktonic and attached (sediment, aquatic macrophyte and submerged wood) habitats, in a riverine wetland. 2. Annual mean abundance of planktonic viruses ranged from 2.3x10(5)-3.8x10(5) particles mL(-1) and varied according to sampling site. Significant seasonal patterns in viral abundance were evident and appeared to be linked to variations in bacterial abundance, dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients. 3. Annual mean abundance of viruses associated with surfaces ranged from 1.3x10(6) particles cm(-2) on aquatic macrophytes to 1.1x10(7) particles cm(-2) on wood and also showed seasonal patterns. The difference in viral dynamics among the different sites emphasizes the importance of considering habitat diversity within wetlands when examining microbial communities.																			0046-5070					MAY	2003	48	5					841	851		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01052.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01052.x													WOS:000182183600008

Upwelling was observed in the south of the lake during the dry, windy season from May to September. Stratification was variable in strength but always present in the north. The lake showed a marked tilting of the epilimnion during the dry season (0-20 m in the South, 60-70 m in the North). This period was followed by oscillations of water masses towards an equilibrium when the strong winds from the south east ceased. Conductivity and pH fluctuations indicated dampened oscillations, particularly at the ends of the lake. Movements of the epilimnion toward an equilibrium position generated and/or re-inforced internal waves. These waves were inferred from fluctuations of chemical and physical characteristics of the lake. The concentrations of inorganic P and N commonly fluctuated by a factor of 3 or more in the epilimnion. The period of long-period internal waves was estimated to be ca. 28-33 days. Turbidity changes suggested pulse production caused by internal waves linked to non-random patchiness in nutrients and organisms. Turbulence resulting from highly dynamic physical events also induce random-patchiness in water composition. The lake water generally showed oligotrophic characteristics near the surface but had high concentrations of nutrients in deep water. The results showed that the trophic state of Lake Tanganyika, like that of the oceans, seems to depend largely on regeneration processes. The annual limnological cycle in Lake Tanganyika appears closely linked to the climatic conditions.

Cladocera and Copepoda of Montane Peatlands of the North Caucasus, Russia: Composition and Formation Patterns of Species Complexes	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												In 2018, the faunas of Cladocera and Copepoda of four mountain Sphagnum peatlands in the Republic of North Ossetia and five in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, Caucasus, Russia, were studied. For each area, species complexes peculiar both to the central part of the secondary water body and to the surrounding Sphagnum floating mat, at the edge of the water, were described. Altogether, 31 species of microcrustaceans were found in the material collected. Among them, two species of Cladocera and eight species of Copepoda were recorded from mountain water bodies of the North Caucasus for the first time. Montane Sphagnum peatlands were shown to be an outpost of northern species distributions, as confirmed by finding two Copepoda species typical of more northerly regions. The abundance of microcrustaceans in floating Sphagnum mats was often tens of times higher than in the water column. The habitat type, seasonality, latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, acidity, and mineralization combined were shown to explain only 32.3% of variations in the species complexes. This indicates a complex factor regulation of the community structure in high-altitude conditions.

Occurrence and behaviour of White-tailed Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla in Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis colonies in countries around the Baltic Sea	ARDEA												The recovery of the Baltic White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla population since the 1980s is a conservation success story. However, the re-establishment of this predator in coastal and lake areas appears to affect Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo during the breeding season. We collated published and unpublished records of White-tailed Eagle occurrence and interactions with Cormorant colonies as well as records of Cormorant anti-predator responses and effects on Cormorant breeding performance. We found evidence for immediate direct effects (mainly kleptoparasitism, predation of eggs and offspring) and indirect effects (facilitating nest predation by mainly gulls and corvids). Repeated disturbance from hunting White-tailed Eagles was also inferred to trigger changes in selection of nest sites, to cause complete abandonment of colonies and lead to regional redistributions of breeders. However, there are also observations of 'unproblematic' coexistence with White-tailed Eagles breeding inside Cormorant colonies. There is some evidence to suggest that nesting opportunities for Cormorants may become further restricted as White-tailed Eagle numbers continue to increase, and we argue that this - in some regions - will impose limitations on the distribution and size of breeding populations of Cormorants.					; Kouzov, Sergey/H-7984-2016; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/O-5444-2016; Kouzov, Sergei/H-7984-2016; Krone, Oliver/AAO-7944-2021; Bregnballe, Thomas/HOH-9413-2023	Krone, Oliver/0000-0002-4507-5124; Herrmann, Christof/0009-0008-4497-3345; Bregnballe, Thomas/0000-0003-2867-478X; Kouzov, Sergey/0000-0001-5261-087X; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/0000-0002-1989-277X; 													0373-2266	2213-1175				DEC	2021	109	3					565	582		10.5253/arde.v109i2.a24	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/arde.v109i2.a24													WOS:000825150800024

Due to their unique physicochemical characteristics, they have recently been receiving increasing attention on their effects in water treatment. Currently, TEP are commonly known as clear, gel-like polysaccharides. This review first introduced the definition of TEP in water treatment and the relationship between TEP and algal organic matter (AOM). Further, in the review, the authors attempt to offer a holistic view and critical analysis concerning the research on TEPs in source water reservoirs, water plants and membrane treatment processes. It was clearly demonstrated in this review that the formation of TEP in source water reservoirs is largely related to water quality and phytoplankton, and the seasonal water stratification may indirectly affect the formation of TEP. In the waterworks, the relationship between TEP and water treatment process is mutual and there is limited research on this relationship. Finally, the mechanism of TEP-induced membrane fouling and the effect of alleviating TEP-induced membrane fouling is discussed in this review. The TEP removed by ultrafiltration can be recombined after membrane, and the recombination mechanism may be an important way to reduce reverse osmosis membrane contamination.

Identification of seasonal varves in the lower Pliocene Bouse Formation, lower Colorado River Valley, and implications for Colorado Plateau uplift	GEOSPHERE												The cause of Cenozoic uplift of the Colorado Plateau is one of the largest remaining problems of Cordilleran tectonics. Difficulty in discriminating between two major classes of uplift mechanisms, one related to lithosphere modification by low-angle subduction and the other related to active mantle processes following termination of subduction, is hampered by lack of evidence for the timing of uplift. The carbonate member of the Pliocene Bouse Formation in the lower Colorado River Valley southwest of the Colorado Plateau has been interpreted as estuarine, in which case its modern elevation of up to 330 m above sea level would be important evidence for late Cenozoic uplift. The carbonate member includes laminated marl and claystone interpreted previously in at least one locality as tidal, which is therefore of marine origin. We analyzed lamination mineralogy, oxygen and carbon isotopes, and thickness variations to discriminate between a tidal versus seasonal origin. Oxygen and carbon isotopic analysis of two laminated carbonate samples shows an alternating pattern of lower delta O-18 and delta O-13 associated with micrite and slightly higher delta O-18 and delta O-13 associated with siltstone, which is consistent with seasonal variation. Covariation of alternating delta O-18 and delta O-13 also indicates that post-depositional chemical alteration did not affect these samples. Furthermore, we did not identify any periodic thickness variations suggestive of tidal influence. We conclude that lamination characteristics indicate seasonal genesis in a lake rather than tidal genesis in an estuary and that the laminated Bouse Formation strata provide no constraints on the timing of Colorado Plateau uplift.

Lawrence			Effects of Ice Freeze-Thaw Processes on U Isotope Compositions in Saline Lakes and Their Potential Environmental Implications	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The dissolved uranium (U) content in the water column of saline lakes varies little between ice-free seasons throughout the whole water column. Such uniformity allows for the potential absolute dating and/or paleohydrologic interpretations of lake sediments and biogenic shell materials using U isotopes. Before using these methods in cold regions, however, it is necessary to evaluate the effects that ice freeze-thaw processes have on the distribution of U isotopes in saline lake waters, and to determine the amount of variation in U isotopic values when such processes occur. In this paper, we collected ice and dissolved water samples from six lakes with variable salinity in February 2021. Five groundwater and three water samples from rivers into Qinghai Lake were sampled in November 2020. The sampled water was analyzed for dissolved concentrations of U-238 and the activity ratio of U-234/U-238 ([U-234/U-238](AR)). The results show that the U-238 concentration of ice samples was less than that of the underlying water. The [U-234/U-238](AR) of ice in the five saline lakes was similar to that of the underlying water with less than a 10 parts per thousand variation, suggesting no observable fractionation between ice and dissolved water. Thus, the ice freeze-thaw processes have almost no effect on the uranium content and [U-234/U-238](AR) of the sampled saline lakes, which were characterized by a limited recharge volume from surface runoff, groundwater, and ice volume, namely the close saline lake in arid alpine background. The results from the indoor freeze-thaw experiments also showed that the U isotopic composition of Qinghai Lake waters and ice were similar with the U-238 concentration of the ice was about 40% of that of the dissolved lake water, supporting the data obtained from natural saline lakes. The above results provide important insights into whether it is feasible to use U isotopes for absolute dating and/or paleohydrologic analysis of lake sediments or biogenic shell materials. In addition, the results are important for evaluating the [U-234/U-238](AR) and uranium concentrations in seawater when there exists a process of melting polar ice, and for determining the initial delta U-234 variations needed for dating of coral and other fossil materials.

Some needle-free connectors have been designed to decrease CRI, but there is a lack of data concerning their impact on infection. Objectives: The objective was to explore the impact of MaxZero (TM) connectors (BD; Franklin Lakes, US) on CRI in ICU. Methods: Observational, preepost design study (2011-2013 and 2014-2016) conducted in the surgical ICU of a tertiary care hospital (18 beds). Patients with a central venous catheter and a length of stay >48 h were included. The connectors replaced all disposable caps used on infusion stopcocks and ramps. The primary parameter was to compare the incidence of CRI between the "before" period and the "after" period. Results: A total of 1633 patients were included (789 "before" and 844 "after"). There was no difference between groups concerning the global duration of catheterisation (12.5 +/- 11.5 days vs. 12.1 +/- 10.9 days). There were 61 CRIs before and 28 CRIs after the introduction of connectors; the incidence of CRI in the "before" group was 20.33 CRI/year (6.18 CRI per 1000 catheter-days) vs. 9.33 CRI/year (2.73 CRI per 1000 catheter-days) in the "after" group (incidence rate ratio = 0.44; 95% confidence interval = 0.28-0.68, p < 0.001). However, after a global analysis of the 6-year period, when adjusting for seasonal effect and pre-existing linear trend, the effect was no longer significant (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval = 0.24-1.35, p = 0.20). Conclusions: Our results do not allow us to conclude to a potential beneficial effect of MaxZero (TM) on CRI but are compatible with its prolonged and safe use in ICU. Only future prospective works will be able to confirm the value of these connectors for CRI prevention. (c) 2018 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Resurgence of Salmonid Herpesvirus-3 Infection (Epizootic Epitheliotropic Disease) in Hatchery-Propagated Lake Trout in Michigan	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Over the past century, populations of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush have declined throughout the Great Lakes basin due to overfishing, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species, and associated recruitment issues from high thiaminase, as well as emerging infectious diseases. To combat these declines, state and federal fishery management agencies undertook substantial stock enhancement efforts, including more stringent regulation of sport and commercial catch limits and increasing hatchery propagation of Lake Trout stocked into Great Lakes basin waterways. One state fish hatchery involved in these rehabilitation efforts experienced mass mortality events in 2012 and 2017. In 2012, following a period of abnormally heavy rain, hatchery staff observed abnormal behavior followed by increased mortalities in two strains of Lake Trout fingerlings, reaching upwards of 20% mortality and totaling a loss of approximately 100,000 fish. In 2017, following another heavy-rain season, 6-8% of 2-year-old Lake Trout experienced morbidity and mortality similar to that observed in 2012. During the 2012 event, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis and splake (Lake Trout x Brook Trout hybrid) reared in flow-through systems receiving water from diseased Lake Trout remained clinically unaffected. Molecular analyses revealed all lots of affected Lake Trout were infected with the salmonid herpesvirus-3 (epizootic epitheliotropic disease virus [EEDV]), a disease that caused complete depopulation of this hatchery in the late 1980s and until 2012 was never again detected in this hatchery or in Michigan. Further sampling detected EEDV in apparently healthy 5-year-old Lake Trout and in wild Mottled Sculpin Cottus bairdii collected in the hatchery source water. The ability of the virus to replicate in tissues of infected fish was verified by exposing naive Lake Trout to the filtered tissue homogenates of infected fish resulting in similar disease signs. Despite the virus going undetected for many years, these two EEDV episodes clearly demonstrate the continued presence of this deadly herpesvirus in the Great Lakes basin.

A total of 1,557 individual fish belonging to 41 species, 25 genera and 13 families were recorded. The important fish species with respect to frequency of occurrence, abundance and weight, respectively, were as follows: Chrysichthys (100%; 43.03%; 17.93%), tilapias (100%; 28.97%; 17.86%), Alestes (100%; 14.13%; 32.10%) and Bagrus (91.67%; 5.65%; 12.80%) in that order. The composition of fish species and their temporal variation in experimental catches were similar to that of commercial catches. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in species abundance, weight and diversity indices between the dry and wet seasons. The modal class of length frequency distribution of the dominant species in the catch, Chrysichthys, reduced from 125mm in 2006 to 95mm in the current study indicating overfishing. Environmental variables considered showed little variation and within optimal ranges for fish survival and did not differ significantly between seasons. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that environmental variables explained 43.30% of the variation in species abundance with Lake water level, nitrite-nitrogen and total dissolved solids being the main environmental factors influencing the structure of the fish community.

These changes could influence the operating conditions of reservoir systems such as Jor hydropower reservoir system (Malaysia) with the total capacity of 150 MW. So, it is necessary to analyze the effect of changes in weather parameters on the river runoff and consequently, the hydropower production. Methods: In this research, LARS-WG was used to downscale the weather parameters such as daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation based on one of the general circulation sub-model (HADCM3) under three emission scenarios, namely, A1B, A2, and B1 for the next 50 years. Then, the artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed, while rainfall and evapotranspiration were used as input data and river runoff as output data to discover the relationship between climate parameters and runoff at the present and in the future time. Results: It was revealed that the monthly mean temperature will increase approximately between 0.3-0.7 degrees C, while the mean monthly precipitation will vary from -22% to +22% in the next 50 years. These changes could shift the dry and wet seasons and consequently, change the river runoff volume. In most months, the results of models integration showed reductions in river runoff. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the output of hydropower reservoir system is highly dependent on the river runoff. So, the impacts of climate changes should be considered by the reservoir operators/managers to reduce these impacts and secure water supplies.

Raptor habitat use in the Lake Chad Basin: insights into the effect of flood-plain transformation on Afrotropical and Palearctic raptors	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												West African flood-plains have undergone major land-use transformations in the second half of the 20th century. To obtain insight in the effect of flood-plain development for irrigated rice cultivation on the abundance, richness, and diversity of Palearctic and Afrotropical raptors, we conducted monthly transect surveys covering dry and wet seasons in four major habitats on the Waza-Logone flood-plain of Cameroon: dry grasslands, cultivated grasslands, rice fields, and seasonally flooded grasslands resembling natural flood-plain vegetation. We recorded 36 raptor species among 2,533 individuals, dominated by Black Kite Milvus migrans, which comprised 42% of counts. Although richness and diversity were not related to land-use for Palearctic raptors, Afrotropical raptor diversity was higher on the flooded grasslands compared to the newly created cultivated habitats and dry grasslands. The abundance of Afrotropical raptors did not significantly differ across habitats but was lower in rice-fields when Black Kite and Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus were excluded. Conversely, Palearctic raptor abundance was highest in post-harvest rice fields, demonstrating the importance of the rice fields as foraging habitat for Palearctic raptors. Further transformation of West Africa's flood-plains is expected, reducing their capacity for Afrotropical raptors, while Palearctic raptors may benefit from expansion of rice-fields, but more research is needed on their vulnerability to pesticide use.

J	Wollmann, K; Deneke, R; Nixdorf, B; Packroff, G				Wollmann, K; Deneke, R; Nixdorf, B; Packroff, G			Dynamics of planktonic food webs in three mining lakes across a pH gradient (pH 2-4)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Acidic mining lakes (ML) in Lusatia (Germany) are characterised by their geogenically determined chemistry. The present study describes the structure, main components and relationships within the food webs of three acidic mining lakes with different pH values (ML 111: pH 2.6; ML 117: pH 2.8; ML Felix: pH 3.6) in order to show their typical characteristics. The investigation covered the period 1995-1997. The number of species and the biomass are both low, but increase with increasing pH. Planktonic components in the most acidic ML 111 (pH 2.6-2.9) comprise bacteria, Ochromonas spp. and Chlamydomonas spp. and a few rotifers (E. worallii, C. hoodi). Heliozoans are the top-predators. In ML 117 (pH 2.8-3) Gymnodinium sp., ciliates, the rotifer B. sericus and the pioneer crustacean Chydorus sphaericus join the pelagial community. Heliozoans were not found in ML 117 or ML Felix (pH 3.4-3.8). ML Felix had the most taxa. The benthic food chain of all three lakes includes phytobenthic algae as producers, chironomids as primary consumers and corixids as top predators in the profundal. Corixids predate on small cladocerans inhabiting the pelagial in lakes with a pH above 2.8 such as ML Felix. They invade the pelagial and act as a connecting link between the benthic and the pelagic food chains, which are isolated in lakes with a lower pH. Occasionally primary producers and consumers were abundant in all three lakes. These organisms do not depend on the degree of acidity, but on the availability of essential ressources. Mass variations covered up any seasonal variation in the extremely acidic ML 111 (0.9 mm(3) l(-1)), while in the other two lakes seasonal patterns of biomass were found.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2000	433	1-3					3	14		10.1023/A:1004060732467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004060732467													WOS:000089613800002

The age model of the sediment core is based on varve counting and Cs-137/Pb-210 dating and reveals that the sedimentary record covers the last 70 years, during which the lake has undergone major changes in productivity and eutrophication in response to nutrient loading. Since 1965, TOC, TIC, TN and TP accumulation rates in general reflect the change from oligo-/mesotrophic to eutrophic level. The isotopic compositions of autochthonous organic matter and authigenic calcite (whitings) demonstrate that carbon isotope fractionation takes place in a CO2-limited pool. In accordance with the historical limnological observations, enhanced eutrophication is reflected by delta(13)C(TOC) increases of over 3 parts per thousand from 1934 to 1985 as a result of less C-12/C-13 fractionation by photosynthesis during intense primary productivity. Decreasing delta(13)C(TIC) values indicate that biogenically induced calcite formation occurred during enhanced primary production accompanied by CO2 limitation. The gradual trend to more light nitrogen isotopic signatures towards the sediment surface reflects the dominance of air nitrogen fixation of cyanobacteria blooms during the last decades. The delta(18)O(TIC) distribution suggests that plankton blooms between 1934 and 1978 had shifted towards the early season with lower temperatures as a result of increasing nutrient level, which subsequently favor plankton blooms even in colder waters. Since the mid 1980s, decreasing delta(13)C(TOC) and increasing delta(13)C(TIC) values since 1985 indicate a more efficient C-12/C-13 fractionation during photosynthesis with no CO2 limitation. This improvement in water quality is in accordance with several remediation measures carried out since the late 1970s, Linear isotopic trends are interrupted by high TIC, TOC, TN and TP accumulation rates in the early 1970s, which can be clearly attributed to the artificial drainage of a nearby wetland carried out during that time. This event can be considered an important external source for nutrient-loaded water and particulate matter and is displayed by significantly heavier delta(13)C(TIC) and delta(18)O(TIC) values in the sedimentary record.

These two sites are Crater Lake National Park (1981m) and Lassen Volcanic National Park (1798m). PMF can provide optimal point-by-point weighting by using the estimates uncertainty in the data and can permit efficient treatment of missing and below detection limit values. It also imposes the nonnegativity constraint on the factors. Seven and six sources were resolved from the Crater Lake National Park and Lassen Volcanic National Park data, respectively. The factors were normalized by using aerosol fine mass concentration data through multiple linear regression so that the quantitative source contributions for each resolved factor were obtained. Among the sources resolved at the two sites, six are common. These six sources exhibit not only similar chemical compositions but also similar seasonal variations at both sites. The Asian dust was represented by Al, Ca, Fe, NO3, S, K, and Ti with strong seasonal variation. Secondary sulfate with a high concentration of S and strong seasonal variation correlated with the Asian dust. Wood smoke was represented by organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and K; sea salt with the high concentrations of Na, S and NO3. Nitrate was dominated by NO3 and motor vehicle with high concentrations of OC, EC, and dust elements. A incinerator source with the presence of Cu and Zn also was resolved from the Crater Lake site. Generally, most of the sources at these two sites showed similar chemical composition profiles and seasonal variation patterns. The source profile of Asian dust resolved from this study agreed reasonably well with the source characteristics found in other Asian dust studies. This study indicated that PMF was a powerful factor analysis method to extract sources from the ambient aerosol concentration data.

J	Mitman, G				Mitman, G			Hay fever holiday: Health, leisure, and place in gilded-age America.	BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE												By the 1880s hay fever (also called june Cold, Rose Cold, hay asthma, hay cold, or autumnal catarrh) had become the pride of America's leisure class. In mid-August each year, thousands of sufferers fled to the White Mountains of New Hampshire, to the Adirondacks in upper New York State, to the shores of the Great Lakes, or to the Colorado plateau, hoping to escape the dreaded seasonal symptoms of watery eyes, flowing nose, sneezing fits, and attacks of asthma, which many regarded as the price of urban wealth and education. Through a focus on the White Mountains as America's most fashionable hay fever resort in the late nineteenth century, this essay explores the embodied local geography of hay fever as a disease. The sufferers found in the White Mountains physical relief, but also a place whose history affirmed their social identity and shaped their relationship to the natural environment. And, they, in turn, became active agents in shaping the geography of place: in the very material relationships of daily life, in the social contours of the region, and in the symbolic space that nature inhabited. In the consumption of nature for health and pleasure, this article suggests, lies an important, yet relatively unexplored, source for understanding changing perceptions of environment and place and the impact of health on the local and regional transformation of the North American landscape.																			0007-5140					FAL	2003	77	3					600	635		10.1353/bhm.2003.0127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2003.0127								14523262					WOS:000185262300005

I argue that both series produce the uncanny in formal ways made possible by conditions of a televisuality characterized by narrative complexity and a pronounced aesthetic. In their first season, both series draw on recognizable conventions of the police procedural genre, but each develops a dialectical narrative structure that rotates between a rational procedural plotline and an irrational, less linear narrative of a secretive community. In my exploration, I conceive of the televisual moment as a form of rupture and draw on Freud's original sense of "the uncanny" as making strange what was fundamentally familiar. I argue that ultimately each series mobilizes "the uncanny" in distinctive ways, resulting in two endings with very different implications.

USE OF BIOASSAYS FOR CYANOBACTERIAL MICROCYSTINS TOXICITY ASSESSMENT	CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING REPORTS												The issues presented in this study concern a very important problem of the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in surface water used for water supply purposes. The objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of cyanotoxic risk in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River (including Slawskie lake which is the beginning of the river), which is a source of drinking water for the inhabitants of Zielona Gora. In order to evaluate toxicity of cyanobacterial bloom it was conducted toxicological testing using aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna, Dugesia tigrina) and heterotrophic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas fluorescens). Test samples were collected from May to October, 2012. The most toxic was a sample collected from Lake Slawskie on 20th October when cyanobacteria bloom with a predominance of Microcystis aeruginosa occurred and the amount of microcystins was the largest.

Nutrient dynamics in a highly managed reservoir system: considering anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and nutrient restoration	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Scott DC, Harris SL, Hebert AS, van Poorten BT. 2017. Nutrient dynamics in a highly managed reservoir system: considering anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and nutrient restoration. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:14-22.Modeling nutrient flux in Alouette Reservoir, British Columbia, allowed us to (1) determine the relative importance of key factors that influence its nutrient dynamics and (2) evaluate the potential value of returning anadromous salmon to this highly altered reservoir. Annual surface water releases over the dam spillway have facilitated out-migration of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) produced by resident kokanee parents since 2005, and these juveniles have returned as adult sockeye annually since 2007, thus restoring an anadromous run lost for nearly 90years. This re-anadromization program may have an effect on the nutrient restoration program, which includes annual additions of nitrogen and phosphorus designed to enhance the recreational kokanee fishery within the reservoir. High flow release to facilitate juvenile out-migration resulted in a net export of nutrients because few adults returned, and a portion of nutrients added to the reservoir were flushed downstream. If only anadromous sockeye are considered, however, nutrient flux was positive in 5 of 6years for nitrogen (average 2.30 kg; range -1.06 to 5.97), and in 4 of 6years for phosphorus (average 0.24 kg; range -0.15 to 0.62). Overall, our results show the export of nutrients by the anadromy restoration project represents an average of just 1.54 and 0.60%, respectively, of the seasonal nitrogen and phosphorus budget for the system. Therefore, although the anadromy restoration results in a net loss of nutrients from the system, its effect on the nutrient restoration project is minimal.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					14	22		10.1080/10402381.2016.1247391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1247391													WOS:000396042900003

We studied its limnology and phytoplankton community to determine how the frequency and depth of water-column mixing influences nutrient cycling and seasonality in this aquatic ecosystem. Methods - Water-column temperature was measured continuously during a full annual cycle between August 2007 and August 2008. Other physical and chemical variables as well as diatom and other phytoplankton communities were investigated on three occasions, namely during the dry season in August of 2007 and 2008, and during the main wet season in April 2009. Key results and conclusions - The water column of Lake Kyaninga is permanently stratified (meromictic) below similar to 100 m depth. Above this depth, mixing frequency varies from daily (down to 8-12 m depth) over at least once per year (down to 39-47 m depth), to once in several years or decades (between 39-47 and similar to 100 m depth). Nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations as well as phytoplankton data classify the lake as low in aquatic productivity (oligotrophic). Its pelagic, open-water phytoplankton community is dominated by Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and Chlorophyta (green algae). Bacillariophyta (diatoms) contribute only a minor part of total phytoplankton biomass in both wet and dry seasons, and are characterized by an assemblage of small Nitzschia species. Epiphytic and epipelie diatoms are relatively few, because steep rocky crater slopes limit the littoral zone even though water-column transparency is high. The composition of recently deposited diatom assemblages preserved in offshore surface sediments gives a good, annually integrated representation of the present-day pelagic diatom community. The documented species richness of the diatom flora of Lake Kyaninga is moderate with about 150 taxa. Only similar to 17% of these are biogeographically restricted to tropical Africa; and most of these belong to the genus Nitzschia.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Rumes, Bob/0000-0001-8549-6743; Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; 													2032-3913						2010	143	3					365	377		10.5091/plecevo.2010.420	http://dx.doi.org/10.5091/plecevo.2010.420													WOS:000286649400012

The discovery of phosphine will shed new light on the mechanisms of P supplement and biogeochemical cycles. Since phosphine is converted to phosphate after complex oxidation via hypophosphite and phosphite, if it were present in the water column, understanding its production and emission could enhance our understanding of P speciation. Assuming that phosphine in the gas phase is an ideal gas and at equilibrium between water and gas interface, phosphine in water solution can be quantified from the equilibrated concentration in gas phase using the Henry's Law. Application of this approach to Lake Taihu, China, phosphine in unfiltered and filtered water samples (0.45 mu m) was analysed. Results showed that phosphine was universally present in Lake Taihu water. Phosphine concentration in unfiltered water ranged from 0.16 to 1.11 pg L-1, and was much less (0.01 to 0.04 pg L-1) in filtered samples. Over 90% of phosphine was adsorbed onto or incorporated into suspended materials with 510% dissolved in the water. Higher phosphine concentrations could be observed in warm seasons. Positive relationships were found between PH3 and TP (average R-2 = 0.59 +/- 0.22) and TSP (average R-2 = 0.37 +/- 0.13).					; Edwards, Marc/J-3557-2012	Edwards, Marc/0000-0002-1889-1193; 													0306-7319	1029-0397					2010	90	9					737	746		10.1080/03067310903013230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067310903013230													WOS:000278653200006

Solms-Laubach, 1883 (Commelinales: Pontederiaceae) in Taabo Lake, Ivory Coast	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												We examined aquatic macroinvertebrates associated with Eichhornia crassipes roots at five sampling sites in Taabo Lake. An average density of 1644 individuals (ind.)/m(2) was recorded. In total, 68 macroinvertebrate taxa belonging to 34 families and 14 orders were identified. Among these, Insecta was predominant (77.94%). The highest densities were recorded at Taabo cite during both rainy and dry seasons. Taxon diversity differences were not observed among all stations according to a Kruskal-Wallis test. High densities of predators were recorded. Next most prevalent in the trophic structure were detritivores. Indicator taxa analysis, using the Indval method, showed that stations upstream of the lake were characterized by eight taxa, while 11 appeared as indicators of the station near the dyke. Predators and herbivores dominated within those indicators. Sites near bays were distinguished by 18 indicator taxa with a predominance of predators and detritivores. Conductivity, NH4+, temperature, PO43-, turbidity and dissolved oxygen were parameters that strongly influenced the macroinvertebrate community.																			0022-2933	1464-5262					2010	44	5-6					257	278		10.1080/00222930903457208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930903457208													WOS:000274636400001

J	Talling, JF; Prowse, GA				Talling, J. F.; Prowse, G. A.			Selective recruitment and resurgence of tropical river phytoplankton: evidence from the Nile system of lakes, rivers, reservoirs and ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The recruitment of major species-components of phytoplankton is considered with reference to diverse water-bodies-rivers, headwater lakes, reservoirs and lateral waters-of the Nile system. The importance of massive 'inocula', carried in flowing and inter-communicating waters, is emphasised; the most direct evidence is from quantitative population dynamics in longitudinally sampled river-reservoir systems. Other indications of extraneous derivation are taken from geographical distribution and apparent invasions of newly recorded species. For five reservoirs, there are records of initial colonisation (in two) and of the annual colonisation of seasonally impounded water (in three). There was a selective recruitment of reservoir/river major species over 1 year to newly created ponds, from a massive inoculum of added river water, studied in relation to the novel and changing physical and chemical environment. Periods of predominant decomposition were there linked with the abundance of other species not observed in the original river water. Reservoir species can be carried to extend abundance far downstream, as observed in the Blue Nile where normal succession was altered by a new reservoir upstream; also in Egypt below the former Aswan Reservoir and the later High Dam Lake. The different and distinctive compositions of the phytoplankton communities in headwater lakes reflect large environmental differences that, with high downstream turbulence, probably make them insignificant for recruitment of most species typical of the downstream waters. There is evidence from hydrology and floristic similarities for recruitment from lateral standing waters along the river, especially those of one major swamp area.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2010	637	1					187	195		10.1007/s10750-009-9995-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9995-2													WOS:000273160800014

Here, monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LSWT data of 364 lakes during 2001-2015 were analysed to determine spatiotemporal patterns of daytime (LSWTd), nighttime (LSWTn), daily LSWT (LSWTm) and their drivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at monthly, seasonal and annual timescales. We focused on spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LSWT trends. Results showed climatological LSWT presented a saddle-shaped distribution along the northeast-southwest direction except for LSWTd in March, while highly heterogeneous LSWT trends without spatial dependence were observed at all timescales. Diurnal asymmetry of LSWT trends was evident with 56.04-88.19% lakes showing smaller LSWTd trends than LSWTn trends except for August and September. Further, we found lake surface albedo trend could effectively explain spatial patterns of LSWT trends at different timescales, and its interactions with other variable trends generally were the largest or second-largest.

Irradiance data from in situ measurements of ultraviolet and visible wavebands permitted to estimate the related attenuation coefficients. Laboratory extinction measurements on filtered (0.22 mu m) and unfiltered water samples were also performed. The integrated approach between in situ and laboratory measurements allowed the determination of the role of the suspended and dissolved matter in the attenuation and extinction of ultraviolet and visible radiation within the water column. As noted, the impact of the suspended and dissolved matter on the lake optical quality was influenced by wind resuspension of particulate matter: the relative role of dissolved matter in the absorption of UV and visible radiation was prevailing at low wind velocity conditions (less than 2.2 m s(-1)), while at high wind velocities (3.9 m s(-1)), particulate matter resuspension strongly influenced the attenuation and the extinction measurements. The extinction in the analyzed wavelengths of filtered and unfiltered water samples and the in situ irradiance measurements allowed us to define new optical parameters and important correlations with limnological and classical optical measurements. By sampling at high spatial resolution (18 stations in 4 km(2)), it was possible to evidence a spatial gradient of the optical and limnological properties, these distributions showed a consistent pattern in all three surveys, and were important for the characterization of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter that was estimated with the spectral slope of the extinction curve spectra. A relatively higher spectral slope was found in the southern basin with respect to the northern, where the maximum values of the attenuation coefficients and limnological parameters were found. These results suggest different sources of dissolved organic matter and/or a different level of photobleaching. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pollen evidence reveals that during the mid-Holocene (similar to8000-5500 cat yr B.P.) lowland tropical plant taxa were growing at elevations similar to200-250 in higher than at present, suggesting conditions about 1.0 degreesC warmer than those prevailing today. Cloud forest genera (Liquidambar, Juglans, Alnus, Ulmus) were also more abundant in the mid-Holocene, indicating greater cloud cover during the dry season. A gradual cooling and drying trend began by similar to5500 cat yr B.P., culminating in the modern forest composition by similar to3500 cal yr B.P. A rise in pollen from weedy plant taxa associated with agriculture Occurred similar to5000 cal yr B.P., and pollen from Zea first appeared in the record at similar to4440 cat yr B.P. Human impacts on local vegetation remained high throughout the late Holocene, but decreased abruptly following the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of Volcan Llopango at similar to1520 cat yr B.P. The past 1500 years are marked by higher lake levels and periodic depositions of exogenous inorganic sediments, perhaps indicating increased climatic variability. (C) 2004 University of Washington.

An understanding of the spatial behaviour of this crayfish could be the baseline for future research aimed at control and management. Following the same pattern as other freshwater decapods, P. clarkii, studied in an irrigation ditch system in Florence, Tuscany, displayed stationary phases (several marked individuals were recaptured in the area) interposed with nomadic bursts of movement (many marked crayfish disappeared). With a few exceptions, nocturnal activity prevailed in almost all the seasons in two different analysed habitats (irrigation ditches and the Massaciuccoli Lake, Lucca). However, in the laboratory, locomotion occurred mostly at daytime. Although still prevailing, P. clarkii's nocturnal activity appeared puzzling, because some of its major predators are nocturnal and this species is mostly herbivorous. The intercalation between stationary and wandering phases leaves open further promising studies on social structures in the field.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					2000	62	2					179	193		10.1007/PL00001330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001330													WOS:000088885000006

Occupancy of young-of-year Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in Barrenland streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is an iconic fish species that is present across the remote subarctic Barrenlands, yet our lack of understanding of their distributional patterns constrains predictions of anthropogenic effects on Barrenland populations. These adfluvial fish rely on seasonal lake-stream connections to migrate, spawn, and rear. We address knowledge gaps on what Barrenland stream attributes are suitable for rearing young-of-year Arctic grayling. Visual surveys of young-of-year Arctic grayling were conducted in 48 streams near Baker Lake, Nunavut, Canada. Occupancy modeling was used to relate stream habitat and landscape variables to fish presence/absence. The best predictors of occupancy were total area of contributing upstream lakes and landcover (upland/lowland); stream basins with larger contributing upstream lake area and more lowland cover were more likely to be occupied. Results suggest that occupancy reflects reliability of stream connectivity throughout the open water season and across years. The occupancy model developed here can adequately predict stream suitability for young-of-year Arctic grayling using lake area and land classification data that are remotely accessed. This may lessen the considerable financial and logistical constraints of conducting field research on Arctic grayling in the vast Barrenlands and facilitate more directed field programs to inform conservation and mitigation plans.

Retreating glaciers, degrading permafrost and rapid mass movements on the one hand and glacier-related disasters, on the other hand, are the sentinels of these phenomena. In this study, we focus our attention on the Makalu Barun region in the Nepal Himalaya, and characterize four main morphoclimatic zones, building on repeated field surveys and interpretation of remote sensing imagery. We distinguish four distinct zones: (i) extreme glacial zone; (ii) glacial zone; (iii) periglacial zone; and (iv) seasonally cold/warm humid zone. While extreme glacial zone is stagnant in its area, remaining three zones have been experiencing areal/location changes associated with changing climate, glacier extent and permafrost distribution. We describe dominant geomorphic processes and typical landforms of these zones in detail, highlighting the role of mass wasting processes and far-reaching process chains acting across distinct morphoclimatic zones. The study provides evidence of very dynamic landform evolution which indicates extreme geomorphological hazards in the Nepal Himalaya.					; Emmer, Adam/P-5500-2014; Kalvoda, Jan/H-6360-2017	Kalvoda, Jan/0000-0002-2789-5495; Emmer, Adam/0000-0002-8268-990X; 													0435-3676	1468-0459				OCT 2	2021	103	4					368	396		10.1080/04353676.2021.2000816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/04353676.2021.2000816		NOV 2021											WOS:000717872700001

To document the background to this phenomenon, we conducted comprehensive household interviews with surviving victims and witnesses of every case of lightning strike in seven administrative areas around Nkhata Bay, Malawi. We find that the consequential lightning strikes are significantly more common in the rainy season and during the morning. Among those victims struck by lightning, there is an average ratio of approximately one death to four injuries, which is substantially higher than the commonly accepted ratio of 1:10. Children and adults are at equal risk of being struck. If struck, the probability of death is greater when the victim is outside in the open or outside under cover than indoors under a tin or thatched roof, but is unaffected by different kinds of footwear or whether it is raining. Reported explanations for strikes often center on witchcraft or other forms of social conflict. Our findings extend the study of consequential lightning strikes in the developing world and highlight cultural factors associated with this hazard. We end with recommendations for reducing the risk of lightning for rural populations.																			0921-030X					JUL	2012	62	3					853	862		10.1007/s11069-012-0113-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-012-0113-9													WOS:000304626500006

The study was conducted in Machakos District, Kenya, to characterise limnochemistry and algal composition of three small man-made reservoirs Ngeki, Ngei and Kavovi, used for cage culture of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In Ngeki, the open water was compared with areas in between the cages and significant differences in dissolved oxygen were found. For N, P and chlorophyll-a, no differences were noticed. In all the reservoirs, temporal variations were noticed for all parameters except NO3N and NH4N. Peak concentrations of nutrients occurred during the rainy season with lower values in the dry season (below detectable limits for SRP). All reservoirs were classified as hyper-eutrophic with a strong positive correlation between chlorophyll-a and TP. Algal abundances changed with season. Chlorophyta dominated at the start of the rainy season, while cyanobacteria prevailed at the onset of thermal stratification. Diatoms prevailed in the dry season but were notably absent in the rainy season. It was concluded that all the reservoirs are suitable for cage culture of Nile tilapia, but this should be undertaken with caution considering critical periods when anoxic conditions may occur.

Identifying which factors are driving spatial patterns in aquatic communities is the central aim of ecology. In this study, data sets of phytoplankton communities and environmental data of two Portuguese reservoirs types (lowland "riverine reservoirs" and higher altitude "artificial lake reservoirs") were used to determine the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) on the community structure. In all the data sets, the multivariate ordination technique Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that regional and local scales explained the majority (9-18% and 13-19%, respectively) of the taxa variance. However, for "riverine reservoirs", time variables were more important, explaining 27% of the variability in phytoplankton assemblages. Variance partitioning was used to assess the individual importance of the three spatial scales and time for the community structure of the two reservoir types. The majority of among-site variability (5.9-21.4%) was accounted for by time variables, with local, regional, and geographical scale variables accounting for 3.3-5.6%, 3.7-4.5% and 2.6-2.9%, respectively. The effects of different spatial scales on phytoplankton communities were clearly interrelated; thus, implying that phytoplankton assemblages are capable of detecting stress from catchment to site scales.

J	Dabrowski, T; Berry, A				Dabrowski, Tomasz; Berry, Alan			Use of numerical models for determination of best sampling locations for monitoring of large lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The implementation of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) that requires all surface waters to achieve at least good status by year 2015 presents a challenge to local authorities responsible for the monitoring programmes. Obtaining a single representative value for each water quality parameter may be extremely difficult to achieve in the case of large lakes, which may be characterised by significant spatial and temporal variation of water quality parameters. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology, which can support the decision making as to the best locations for water quality sampling when developing monitoring systems of large lakes. The methodology is based on three-dimensional hydrodynamic and a conservative tracer transport numerical modelling and utilises the concept of flushing and residence time. The 3D numerical model of Lough Corrib located in the west of Ireland was created and used to calculate its residence time and flushing pathways. Based on the results it was possible to identify the areas in the lake that are characterised by the local residence time values close to the lake's average as well as by the values significantly lower and higher. Three water classes have been introduced and the authors recommend that sampling takes place in all three classes at various frequencies. Spatial distribution of the flushing pathways allows identifying the areas in the lake that best represent the lake's average conditions both in the long term and seasonally, where monitoring can be carried out at the required frequency; worst affected areas can also be identified. The methodology can be used to improve robustness of the monitoring programme and may also contribute towards the reduction of both sampling and analytical costs, both at the design and operational stages.

Climate Impacts on Northern Canada: Regional Background	AMBIO												Understanding the implications of climate change on northern Canada requires a background about the size and diversity of its human and biogeophysical systems. Occupying an area of almost 40% of Canada, with one-third of this contained in Arctic islands, Canada's northern territories consist of a diversity of physical environments unrivaled around the circumpolar north. Major ecozones composed of a range of landforms, climate, vegetation, and wildlife include: Arctic, boreal and taiga cordillera; boreal and taiga plains; taiga shield; and northern and southern Arctic. Although generally characterized by a cold climate, there is an enormous range in air temperature with mean annual values being as high as -5 degrees C in the south to as low as -20 degrees C in the high Arctic islands. A similar contrast characterizes precipitation, which can be >700 mm y(-1) in some southern alpine regions to as low as 50 mm y(-1) over islands of the high Arctic. Major freshwater resources are found within most north m ecozones, varying from large glaciers or ice caps d lakes to extensive wetlands and peat lands. Most of the North's renewable water, however, is found within its major river networks and originates in more southerly headwaters. Ice covers characterize the freshwater systems for multiple months of the year while permafrost prevails in various forms, dominating the terrestrial landscape. The marine environment, which envelops the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, is dominated by seasonal to multiyear sea ice often several meters thick that plays a key role in the regional climate. Almost two-thirds of northern Canadian communities are located along coastlines with the entire population being just over 100 000. Most recent population growth has been dominated by an expansion of nonaboriginals, primarily the result of resource development and the growth of public administration. The economies of northern communities, however, remain quite mixed with traditional land-based renewable resource-subsistence activities still being a major part of many local economies.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				JUL	2009	38	5			SI		248	256		10.1579/0044-7447-38.5.248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447-38.5.248								19714957					WOS:000268360100003

This lake is characterized by a phenomenon of ebb and flow of the Mekong River according to the rainy season. Its size varies from one to five, and it is the place where rice is cultivated. Rice is the main agricultural activity of the country and the main food of its population. The study of this agro-ecosystem, carried out through surveys in six rice-growing villages, shows a complexity in the understanding of these ecosystem services. Some are positive, others are negative. Some are positive up to a certain level but become negative afterwards. Some are co-produced by rice cultivation, which over time has shaped the ecosystem. We also show, from an analysis of agrarian systems, that production systems are more or less compatible with maintaining these services.

J	Villena, MJ; Romo, S				Villena, MJ; Romo, S			Phytoplankton changes in a shallow Mediterranean lake (Albufera of Valencia, Spain) after sewage diversion	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Phytoplankton from Lake Albufera, a shallow, polimictic, freshwater lake, was studied before and after sewage diversion. The lake is used as a reservoir for rice cultivation in the surrounding lake area. Due to antropogenic eutrophication in the 1960s, the lake turned from a mesotrophic to a hypertrophic, turbid state. In 1991, a restoration plan of the lake started which has reduced 30% of sewage effluents. Total phosphorus in the lake was reduced about 31%, from 0.49 to 0.34 mg l(-1), but nitrate did not vary. Chlorophyll-a mean annual values diminished to half, although hypertrophic levels remained (mean value from 318 mug l(-1) to 180 mug l(-1)). The algal community structure indicates a response to P reduction in the direction of increasing equal contribution of algal groups. Cyanobacteria are still the dominant group, but reduced their biomass by about 15%, due to filamentous cyanobacteria depletion (from 78% to 48% of total phytoplankton biovolume), in favour of chroococcal cyanobacteria (changed from 7 to 23% in the 1990s). Other algal groups, especially diatoms and chlorophytes, also increased their contribution in the phytoplankton after nutrient diversion, while euglenophytes, indicative of organic matter pollution in the lake, decreased. There were pronounced changes in phytoplankton composition and a general trend toward presence of smaller algal species. The dominant species in biovolume during the 1980s, Planktothrix agardhii, almost disappeared in the lake in the 1990s, and was replaced seasonally by the slender Pseudanabaena galeata. Disappearance of Planktothrix agardhii, allowed large Cladocera to control algae early in the year (dominant small diatoms and chlorophytes), during several clear water phases occurring in recent years that lasted up to five weeks. Even though some improvement of the lake water quality was observed, complementary restoration measures are suggested, such as a reduction of phosphorus below 0.05 mg l(-1), control of pesticides in the catchment area, and management of benthivorous-planktivorous fish species, in order to re-establish phytoplankton composition and submerged plants as at the beginning of the 20(th) century.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					281	287		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008565.23626.aa	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008565.23626.aa													WOS:000188455600037
J	Kalinowska, K				Kalinowska, K			Bacteria, nanoflagellates and ciliates as components of the microbial loop in three lakes of different trophic status	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The major components of the microbial loop (dissolved organic carbon, bacteria, nanoflagellates and ciliates) were examined in three Polish lakes (Masurian Lakeland, North-Eastern Poland): highly eutrophic (Lake Rynskie), mesotrophic (Lake Kuc) and humic, acid (Lake Smolak Duzy). Microbial loop was distinctly differentiated among studied lakes. In the eutrophic lake, the microbial loop was characterized by a wide variety of biotic components, great taxonomic, trophic and size differentiation of ciliates (dominated by bacterivorous and predatory taxa). Probably, in this lake autochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) prevailed. In the mesotrophic lake, the microbial loop comprised fewer components and the taxonomic and trophic variability of ciliates (dominated mainly by bacterivorous and algivorous taxa) was smaller. This lake contained almost the same amount of DOC, but part of it was probably less available and allochthonous origin. Much of the DOC in the humic lake being poorly available (humic substances prevailed) and hence there were lower densities of bacteria and still lower of nanoflagellates and ciliates (dominated by large-sized mixotrophic and small-sized bacterivorous species). The only significant correlation between bacteria and ciliates suggests that the food chain in this lake is short and that the high concentrations of DOC of allochthonous origin are not readily assimilated. Additionally, low pH values restricted growth of the studied groups of organisms and decomposition of DOC by bacteria. The number of significant correlations differed among lakes and in different temporal scales. In the eutrophic lake the relationships were stronger in both seasonal and diel cycle. Practically no relationships were found in the humic lakes in both scales. Generally, diel correlations were stronger than those in the seasonal scale.

The Gambia estuary has a normal salinity gradient, while the Saloum has an inverse gradient. Bonga shad Ethmalosa fimbriata were collected in both ecosystems during a 16 mo period (June 2001 to September 2002) at 5 locations, to investigate the role A of salinity on life history traits. The main traits were studied at a spatio-temporal scale: reproduction from macroscopic examination of the gonads, oocyte counting and measuring, and growth from interpretation and measurements of a sub-sample of otoliths. Analysis of genetic differentiation at 3 intronic and 1 anonymous nuclear gene loci was also carried out to investigate differences between estuaries and among locations. The results did not show any allelic frequency heterogeneity between populations, indicating that populations of both estuaries represent 1 single panmictic unit, and that selection is not significantly acting on these loci. Hence, the response of the different traits to environmental variation may primarily represent phenotypic plasticity. The seasonal cycle of reproduction was clearer in the Saloum, occurring during a long period (January to August). The calculated size at maturity was reduced for both sexes in the upper Saloum, where the salinity was highest. The relative fecundity and the oocyte size were larger in the Saloum. On the otoliths, translucent zones, formed each year at the end of the rains (September to October), were used to estimate the age in months. Growth rates were reduced in the hypersaline environment of the Saloum, whereas growth differences were smaller between the Gambia and the pooled Saloum data, with a salinity < 60 psu. Growth was faster in the lower parts of the Saloum, related to better conditions for fish. The results illustrate that an environment with high salinity (> 60 psu) affects the growth, reduces the size-at-maturity and increases the fecundity of E. fimbriata.					; Panfili, Jacques/J-9397-2016; Durand, Jean-Dominique/G-3713-2016; PANFILI, JACQUES/J-9397-2016	GUINAND, Bruno/0000-0002-6934-1677; Panfili, Jacques/0000-0003-0504-2384; Durand, Jean-Dominique/0000-0002-0261-0377; 													0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	270						241	257		10.3354/meps270241	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps270241													WOS:000221616700019

Over a period of twelve months, the spawning behaviour of gibel carp in Lake Pamvotis (NW Greece) was monitored. Females almost exclusively (97.7%) composed the population, indicating gynogenesis using the sperm of other species. Reproduction began in March and lasted through April. Contrary to the situation reported in other ecosystems, common carp was not present in the spawning grounds during the spawning season of gibel carp; the most abundant other species present at that time was Rutilus ylikiensis. To evaluate the sperm donating results of R. ylikiensis as compared with other species of the lake, eggs of gibel carp were fertilised with sperm of R. ylikiensis (group 1), Carassius auratus (group 2), and Cyprinus carpio (group 3). Also, gibel carp eggs attached to natural substrates were collected from the spawning grounds (group 4). Hatching success ranged from 9-29% in group 4, compared to 95-98% in groups 1, 2 and 3. Over a period of 60 days after hatching, mortality ranged from 35% (group 1) to 56% (group 3), and specific growth rate from 2.4% (group 3) to 2.9% (group 1). We conclude that gibel carp can successfully utilise sperm of ylikiensis roach, which was the best available sperm donor option for the gynogenctically reproducing gibel carp of the take.					; Nathanailides, Cosmas/C-6650-2008; Gouva, Evangelia/AAE-5676-2019; Perdikaris, Costas/H-5334-2012	Perdikaris, Costas/0000-0002-5417-6242; Nathanailides, Cosmas/0000-0001-9215-4127; 													0777-6276	2295-0451				JAN	2004	134	1					55	60																WOS:000220600000008

Coastal lakes and lagoons as dynamic sites of exchange among the Tlingit of Alaska	MARITIME STUDIES												Among the maritime Tlingit of the Northwest Coast of North America, little lakes or lagoons are defined by several terms, the most common of which is aak'w. The Tlingit term is applied to both freshwater lakes and salt water lagoons, and is relational (lagoons are small as compared to large freshwater lakes or saltwater bays) and processual (involving seasonal changes, permeability and even long-term transformation vis-a-vis contiguous features, such as rivers, bays, and wetlands) in its portrayal of these dynamic coastal features. Lagoons are also conceptualized, and in some cases even engineered, as rich and liminal ecological edges and sites of exchange. Birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, insects, along with humans, exploit them intensively at particular stages of the seasonal round or life cycle, while at other times they are perceived as relatively dormant, even forbidding, landscapes. This paper examines the complex Tlingit perceptions of and interactions with lagoons and their implications for contemporary coastal management.

Establishment of willows using the novel DeValix technique: ecological restoration mats designed for phytotechnologies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION												Successful willow (Salix spp., hybrids and cultivars) establishment is a major determinant of their effectiveness when grown for phytotechnologies. Vertically-planted hardwood cuttings have been shown to produce adequate willow growth and survival, although site conditions at phytoremediation installations can make vertical planting methods unsuitable. The DeValix willow mat restoration technique was designed and tested as an alternative horizontal planting method that can be installed by hand in a variety of environmental applications. The DeValix technique was evaluated by testing five willow clones ("Millbrook"; "Sherburne"; "SX61"; "SX67"; "Tully Champion") grown at two phytoremediation sites (Ontonagon, MI; Manitowoc, WI) for the 2019 growing season. Differences in survival and growth were tested among sites, genotypes, and their interactions. Stem height, diameter, and number of stems per mat were compared to identify clones with greater establishment success and higher phytoremediation potential. Results demonstrated significant effects of site (p < 0.0001) and clone (p < 0.0001) on shoot number. Additionally, the site x clone interaction significantly affected stem height (p = 0.0045) and diameter (p = 0.0166). Stem density ranged from 95,000 to 212,000 stems per hectare, indicating the DeValix technique is a viable establishment method for environmental applications, including phytoremediation and shoreline stabilization. Novelty statement This research analyzes the establishment success of the DeValix technique, a novel horizontal planting method for willow cultivars, and evaluates the DeValix technique as an alternative to other horizontal techniques and traditional vertical planting methods currently used in environmental applications. Results from this study add to the current knowledge of planting techniques and assesses the use of the DeValix technique for planting willow cultivars that are currently being tested in several phytotechnology systems.					; Pilipovic, Andrej/AAE-7788-2021	Pilipovic, Andrej/0000-0002-9458-0581; Vinhal, Ryan/0000-0001-7114-1853; Zalesny, Ronald/0000-0001-5118-5592; Rogers, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9631-9088													1522-6514	1549-7879				JUN 7	2022	24	7					730	743		10.1080/15226514.2021.1970102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.1970102		NOV 2021						34726556					WOS:000713899500001
J	Gao, YJ; Zhang, YQ				Gao, Yanjun; Zhang, Yongqiang			Effects of the Three Gorges Project on Runoff and Related Benefits of the Key Regions along Main Branches of the Yangtze River	WATER												The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is the largest hydroelectric project in the world. It is crucial to understand the relationship between runoff regime changes and TGP's full operation after 2009 in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). This paper defines core, extended and buffer areas of YRB, analyzes the effects of TGP on runoff anomaly (RA), runoff variation (RV) and change of coefficient of variation (CCV) between two periods (2003-2008 and 2009-2016), takes percentage of runoff anomaly (PRA) as the evaluation standard, assures alleviation effect on severe dry and wet years of the research area, and finally summarizes related benefits of flood control from TGP. Our results indicate the inter-annual fluctuation of runoff in the core and extended areas expanded, but reduced in the buffer areas, and the frequencies of severe dry and wet years alleviated in the buffer, core and extended areas. Generally, the extended and core areas become less wet, and the buffer areas become less dry. The RV and CCV are both strengthened in the extended and core areas, but are weakened in the buffer areas, and RV is well positively correlated (R-2 = 0.80) to CCV. Furthermore, the main benefits of TGP on flood control are remarkable in the reduction of disaster affected population, the decrease of agricultural disaster-damaged area, and the decline of direct economic loss. However, due to torrentially seasonal and non-seasonal precipitation, the sharp rebounds of three standards for Hubei and Anhui occurred in 2010 and 2016, and the percentage of agricultural damage area of five regions in the core and extended areas did not decline synchronously and performed irregularly. Our results suggest that the five key regions along the main branches of the Yangtze River should establish a flood control system and promote the connectivity of infrastructures at different levels to meet the significant functions of TGP. It is a great challenge for TGP operation to balance the benefits and conflicts among flood control, power generation and water resources supply in the future.

J	Wan, ML; Wang, J				Wan, Mingli; Wang, Jun			Nanshanopteris nervosa gen. et sp nov., a glenopterid foliage from the Changhsingian Sunan Formation in Yumen, western China	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												A new form of pinnate foliage, Nanshanopteris nervosa gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Changhsingian Sunan Formation in Dashankou, Gansu, western China. Pinnules are auriculate, semicircular and tongue-shaped. The apical and basal pinnules gradually decrease in size relative to those in the middle part of the frond. The venation is dichotomous and very dense. Veins are derived from the rachis at the base of lower leaf margin. Pinnules are amphistomatic. Epidermal cells of both lower and upper epidermis are polygonal, and stomata are located parallel to the subtle veins. Papillae occur on the subsidiary cells and overarch the stomatal pores; very few normal cells of the upper epidermis bear papillae. The frond morphology and cuticles suggest that the plant probably is a new member of the Peltaspermales. Based on the frond architecture, Nanshanopteris is attributed to a new form group of peltasperms named glenopteroids, which have distinctive pinnate, monopodial frond with a basally widened petiole, and alethopteroid-type pinnules. It might be an endemic species in the Cathaysian-Angaran mixed flora of western China. Judging from the characteristics of the new plant, such as the significant thickness of the cuticles, the occurrence of well-developed papillae around the deeply sunken stomata, and the association with other xeromorphic plants like conifers, and sedimentological observations suggest that the new plant probably grew along a lake margin under seasonally wet climate.

Breeding behaviour and distribution of the tucunare Cichla aff. monoculus in a clear water river of the Bolivian Amazon	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The breeding behaviour and distribution of tucunare Cichla aff. monoculus were studied for 2 months during the breeding season in the Paragua River, Bolivia. Tucunare were more abundant in the old remnant channels and isolated lakes than in the main river channel. The breeding period was delayed for c. 1 month in the river compared to the old remnant channels and lakes. The batch fecundity ranged between 3712 and 10 355 for females weighing 460 and 1380 g, respectively. Gonad analysis of egg-guarding or juvenile-guarding females showed that a female was able to spawn more than once during the breeding season. Nests were significantly larger and deeper in the isolated lakes than in the old remnant channels and in the main river. The maximum depth of the nests also differed significantly, being deeper in the isolated lakes than in the river channel and in the old remnant channels. (c) 2006 The Authors.

J	Bassukas, D; Emmanouilidis, A; Avramidis, P				Bassukas, Dimitrios; Emmanouilidis, Alexandros; Avramidis, Pavlos			Late Holocene Hydro-Climate Variability in the Eastern Mediterranean: A Spatial Multi-Proxy Approach	WATER												A total of thirteen (13) paleoclimatic coastal and hinterland archives of the broader eastern Mediterranean region were collected and examined statistically in search of underlying trends for the period 2800 to 200 BP. For each archive, a proxy record representative of hydro-climatic changes was selected, normalized using z-factors to facilitate intercomparison, and analyzed statistically. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using a clustering analysis (HCA) and dimension reduction (PCA), which led to groupings of similar records temporally, and allowed the identification of spatially underlying modes of variability. Two main modes of variability were identified, further supporting complex trajectories of paleoclimatic evolution in the region. The first mode was identified for sites presenting a trend from a wetter to an overall drier phase, with respective changes at major phase shifts at 1400 BP and 1100 BP. All sites were from the southern and northern Balkan region, as well as southwestern Turkey. A contrasting dry to wet trend was identified for a site in the Peloponnese (Greece) and the Levant, with a major phase shift at around 750 BP. The inclusion of different proxies from very different environmental settings and the 200-year window has complicated the connection of established short-term climatic events to the study's findings.

However, characterizing natal dispersal in fishes is complicated by the difficulties of tracking origins and movement during early life-history stages. We combined direct observation of natal dispersal based on otolith chemistry with indirect estimates of dispersal from population genetics to quantify intergenerational dispersal of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) inhabiting a river network. Average parent-offspring dispersal was estimated as 7.7 km from genetic isolation-by-distance and demographic population data. Otolith chemistry indicated that adults were captured an average of 8.3 km from their natal tributary, supporting the genetics-based estimate. Our estimate of intergenerational dispersal is higher than previous estimates for lotic fishes and considerably higher than estimates for smallmouth bass in lake systems. Differences in availability of seasonal habitats for small-mouth bass may account for the contrasting scales of dispersal between lake and river populations. The large intergenerational dispersal distance of riverine smallmouth bass should be considered in conservation of fisheries or efforts to control invasive populations in river networks.

Considered as a Class B wetland, the lake has been stayed within the metropolitan area of Istanbul overtime. The samples from the surface water were taken monthly by using Nansen bottles at 5 sampling sites through the period of March-November. After experimental procedures, a total of 46 taxa were recorded belonging to Bacillariophyta (20), Charophyta (4), Chlorophyta (6), Cryptophyta (1), Cyanobacteria (4), Euglenozoa (3), and Miozoa (8) divisions. The phytoplankton densities were found to be varied from 76 individual cm' to 3,283 individual cm(-3) throughout the channel and the variation for chlorophyll-a contents was between 0.99-55.32 mg m(3) . From our results, the heavy metal and nutrient concentrations were found to be as: 0.78-1.55 mg L-1 for Al, 4.2813.88 mg L-1 for B, 1,201-1,693 mg L-1 for Ca, 45.20-120.40 mu g L(-1 )for Cd, 432.40-1,398.40 mu g L-1 for Cr, 232.00-1,043.00 mu g L-1 for Cu, 663.40-2,315.60 mu g L-1 for Fe, 626.20-1,435.20 mg L-1 for K, 738.001,113.00 mg L-1 for Mg, 1,882-6,084 mg L-1 for Na, 30.00-317.80 mu g L-1 for Ni, 17.40-158.00 mu g L-1 for Pb, and 440.20-1,186.20 mu g L-1 for Zn.

J	Farahnak, A; Essalat, M				Farahnak, A; Essalat, M			A study on cercarial dermatitis in Khuzestan province, south western Iran	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Cercarial dermatitis' or swimmer's itch' is an itchy inflammatory response to the penetration of the skin by non-human schistosome parasites. In the hot season, (May to September) in Khuzestan province in the south west of Iran, swimming in canals and agriculture activities in swampy areas are common. This survey was made on people from villages north of Ahwaz city in south west Iran, to estimate cercarial dermatitis in this region. Methods: 2000 people were observed for clinical signs of cercarial dermatitis. Also 2000 Lymnaea gedrosiana snails were collected from agriculture canals and examined for animal schistosome cercariae during 1998-2000. Results: From this survey 1.1% of people had pruritic maculopapular rash on their feet, hands or other parts of body. From the total of examined snails, 2.4% were found to be infected with bird schistosome cercariae including Trichobilharzia species. Conclusion: Cercarial dermatitis could be a health problem in this area. This is the first report of cercarial dermatitis from this region of Iran.																			1471-2458					NOV 7	2003	3								35	10.1186/1471-2458-3-35	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-3-35								14604437					WOS:000187112900001

Aquatic invertebrate community structure and phenology of the intermittent treed swamps of the semi-arid Paroo lowlands in Australia	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The middle Paroo lowlands in semi-arid western New South Wales support numerous intermittent wetlands of various types. Differences between them are promoted by three ecological drivers: salinity, turbidity and hydroperiod. Community structure and phenology of the two most common types, saline lakes and claypans, are known but similar ecologies are lacking for the third most common wetland, the treed swamps. These are of six subtypes distinguished by dominant tree species, geomorphology and hydroperiod, all with similar community structure and phenology, but with differing invertebrate diversities. Summed diversity is not as high as in local creek pools, the shorter hydroperiods and simpler geomorphology of the treed swamps being restrictive so that there is almost no replacement of species during the early dominance of branchiopods and later of insects. Such treed swamps are uncommon in the semi-arid zone, but much more speciose treed swamps are known under similar and seasonally dry Mediterranean climates of the Western Australian Wheatbelt where hydroperiods are more stable.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2022	30	4			SI		771	784		10.1007/s11273-021-09846-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-021-09846-0		OCT 2021						34728897					WOS:000712234500002

At ELW, annual yield of N varied by a factor of S (0.4-3.2 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and was a linear function of runoff (R-2 = 0.89 and 0.74 for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen, respectively). Nitrogen yield increased faster than increases in runoff; that is, ecosystem processes enhanced N losses during years with high runoff and retarded losses during dry years. The timing of snowmelt runoff had a large effect on catchment inorganic N dynamics: nitrate pulses were greater and DIN retention was lower in years with deep, late melting snowpacks. We hypothesize that in the Sierra Nevada, labile N pools in soils are increasingly stocked during years with high snowfall amounts. These findings and modeling studies in high-elevation watersheds suggest that if current trends toward warmer air temperatures and earlier snowmelt continue, N retention will increase in the Sierra Nevada.																			0043-1397					MAY	2001	37	5					1445	1461		10.1029/2000WR900371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900371													WOS:000168266400028
J	Charmillot, PJ; Hofer, D; Pasquier, D				Charmillot, PJ; Hofer, D; Pasquier, D			Attract and kill: a new method for control of the codling moth Cydia pomonella	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The attract and kill technique has been formulated in a product under the trade name 'Sirene CM(R)'. It consists of a viscous paste containing 0.16% codlemone to attract the male moths and 6.0% permethrin to kill them. The formulation is applied by hand twice per season using a specially developed system which can be calibrated for application of the paste to the host plant in small droplets of either 100 mu l or 50 mu l. Between 1995 and 1997, 15 trials on control of the codling moth were conducted in isolated orchards in the Lake Geneva region. In each plot, depending on tree size, two applications varying between 52 and 537 g ha(-1) of Sirene CM were made. In 14 trials, the larval attack of the codling moth on fruit was below the economic threshold of 1% and the hibernating population stayed at a low level. One single plot (0.4 ha) had to be treated with a curative spray in 1995, because the initial population was much too high. According to the reductions in trap catch and of mating frequency measured by tethered codling moth females, efficiency of the attract and kill droplets lasted 5-7 weeks, after which it decreased slowly.

Distribution and fluctuations of backswimmers (Notonectidae) in a tropical shallow lake and predation on microcrustaceans	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Notonectids are widely distributed in freshwaters and can prey on zooplankton in temperate lakes. However, its role in structuring the zooplankton community is unknown in tropical lakes. Thus, our objective was to study the notonectid Martarega uruguayensis in a Brazilian tropical shallow lake to evaluate its potential as a zooplankton predator. Its horizontal distribution was analized in the lake throughout one year in fortnightly samplings. Backswimmers were more abundant (mean density 162.9 +/- 25.8 ind. m(-2)) in the cool-dry season, with a strong preference by the littoral zone (mean density 139.9 +/- 17.5 ind. m(-2)). Laboratory experiments were undertaken with young and adult notonectid and the two most abundant cladocerans, Daphnia gessneri and Ceriodaphnia richardi, as prey. Predation by backswimmers in the laboratory showed that only juveniles fed on microcrustaceans (mean ingestion rate of 1.2 +/- 0.2 Daphnia and 1.0 +/- 0.2 Ceriodaphnia per predator per hour), without size selectivity. Adult insects probably have difficulties in detecting and manipulating small planktonic organisms. On the other hand, young instars might influence zooplankton community, especially in the littoral zone of the lake. This study does contribute to a better understanding of trophic interactions in tropical shallow lakes and is the first to investigate the predation of a notonectid on microcrustaceans from Lake Monte Alegre.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				FEB	2017	77	1					108	117		10.1590/1519-6984.10815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.10815								27409228					WOS:000397873600015

This study proposes an application of a multimetric system for the bioassessment of the contamination during dry (May), rainy (July) and post-rainy conditions (November) in the main stream of the Lerma-Chapala basin. It included seven physiochemical determinations for the Water Cluality Index (WQI), an Extended Biotic Index (EBI) based on the macrobenthos communities and the application of bioassays on sorghum seeds. The results indicated that according to the levels of the WQI there was a big difference between the river and the lake; during the dry season, the river figures in the scale of polluted to highly polluted, including its entrance to Chapala Lake, the rest of the lake was placed within the interval between low pollution and acceptable. In rainy and post-rainy periods, the river improved and was found within the range of polluted to not very polluted, in the mean time the entire lake was mantained within not very polluted and acceptable. According to the I BE, which was only applied to the river, the upper basin was placed within the range of polluted to severe pollution, while the intermediate and lower basin maintained their highly polluted conditions; for rainy and post-rainy seasons, the conditions improved smoothly. According to the WQI, EBI and the bioassays on dry conditions, the most polluted area in the river was the intermediate basin.																			0188-8897						2007	17	1		S			17	30																WOS:000248955400004

Kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (lacustrine sockeye salmon), offer promise as systems for studying the physiological mechanisms of homing ability in salmon. Three types of physiological study, from behavior to molecules, were conducted using Lake Toya and Lake Shikotsu, Hokkaido, Japan, as model "oceans" and are reviewed here. The first study examined homing behavior of mature sockeye salmon in Lake Toya using ultrasonic tracking systems, testing for use of visual cues and magnetic orientation. Visual cues, but not magnetic orientation, appeared to be important in straight homing behavior. The second study examined the effect of hormonal controlling mechanisms, in relation to sexual differences, on homing duration (the time required to home) and homing accuracy during the spawning season in Lake Shikotsu. Administering gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog shortened homing duration. The third study examined the olfactory discriminating ability by salmon of home stream odorants using a two-choice test tank. Sockeye salmon exhibited preferential upstream selective movement toward artificial home stream water that had been prepared to mimic the composition of amino acids and related substance of the home stream. These results demonstrate the suitability of the lacustrine model for studying the physiological mechanisms of homing ability in sockeye salmon.

J	Chen, KH; Hwang, C; Chang, LC; Tanaka, Y				Chen, Kuan-Hung; Hwang, Cheinway; Chang, Liang-Cheng; Tanaka, Yoshiyuki			Infiltration coefficient, percolation rate and depth-dependent specific yields estimated from 1.5 years of absolute gravity observations near a recharge lake in Pingtung, Taiwan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An efficient underground reservoir management requires reliable hydrogeological parameters, such as infiltration coefficient, percolation rate and specific yield (S-y) values. The cross-well pumping test is a well-known method for determining S-y, but different unsaturated flow models can lead to various S-y results. Heterogeneity in unsaturated and saturated zones can restrict well-dependent methods in estimating these parameters on a regional scale, for which an alternative, gravity-based method is attempted in this study. We established an absolute gravity site at the Wanlong Primary school (WLPS) near a recharge lake (an artificial lake) in the Pingtung Plain and collected 1.5 years of gravity data in 2019-2020. Around a monsoonal rain event in late May 2020, gravity values underwent three stages of changes. The first stage experienced a rapid gravity rise of 18 mu gal from infiltrated rain, followed by stable gravity values in the second stage when the infiltrated rain recharged the aquifer, and the third stage showed a persistent gravity increase with rising groundwater level. The gravity-based estimate of infiltration coefficient is 0.84 +/- 0.14, and the percolation rate is about 15 m/day, suggesting that WLPS is over a high infiltration region. A depth-dependent S-y profile up to 30 m depth was constructed using gravity and groundwater data. In the dry season, it was found that S-y values are higher at the aquifer depths of 22-28 m than in the shallow part. However, some S-y values determined in the wet seasons are overestimated due to high soil water content (SWC) changes, which induced particularly large gravity changes in the 30-m unsaturated zone of WLPS when the wet season started. This study confirms the advantage of using high precise gravity measurements (at one mu gal level) and hydrology records for regional hydrogeological parameter estimation.

To examine the sources of DOG, carbon isotopes (C-14 and C-13) were analyzed in DOC from surface waters, groundwaters and soils in a small forested catchment on the Canadian Shield in central Ontario. A significant fraction (geater than 50%) of DOC in major inflows to the:lake is composed of carbon incorporated into organic matter, solubilized and flushed into the stream within the last 40 years. In contrast, C-14 in groundwater DOC was old indicating extensive recycling of forest floor derived organic carbon in the soil column before elution to groundwater in the lower B and C soil horizons. A small upland basin had a wide range in C-14 from Old groundwater values at baseflow under dry basin conditions to relatively modem values during high flow or wetter antecedent conditions. Wetlands export mainly recently fixed carbon with little seasonal range. DOC in streams entering the small lake may be composed of two pools; an older recalcitrant pool delivered by groundwater and a young labile pool derived from recent organic matter. The relative proportion of these two pools changes seasonally due the changes in the water flowpaths and organic carbon dynamics. Although changes in local climate (temperature and/or precipitation) may alter the relative proportions of the old and young pools, the older pool is likely to be more refractory to sedimentation and decomposition in the lake setting. Delivery of older pool DOC from the catchment and susceptibility of this older pool to photochemical decomposition may consequently be important in governing the minimum DOC concentration limit in lakes.

J	Shastria, Y; Diwekar, U				Shastria, Y.; Diwekar, U.			Optimal control of lake pH for mercury bioaccumulation control	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Mercury is recognized internationally as an important pollutant since mercury and its compounds are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, and pose human and ecosystem risks. A critical aspect of mercury cycling is its bioaccumulation, mainly as methylmercury, along the aquatic food web resulting in high risk of human exposure through contaminated fish consumption. Since lake acidity (pH) and mercury methylation are correlated, control of lake pH through lake liming is a possible option to mitigate mercury bioaccumulation. This work proposes to use optimal control theory to derive time-dependent lake liming strategies for a tighter control of lake pH. Since the behavior of the freshwater ecosystems such as lakes is often associated with considerable uncertainties, a robust and realistic analysis should incorporate such uncertainties. This work models the time-dependent uncertain variations in the basic lake pH value and derives the liming profiles in the presence of such seasonal pH fluctuations. Established techniques from real options theory are employed for modeling the uncertainty as a stochastic process, and stochastic optimal control is used for deriving liming profiles. The approach is critically evaluated through applications to various case study lakes. Considering the substantial costs associated with liming operations, the work formulates a multi-objective problem highlighting the tradeoff between accurate pH control and liming cost. The results of the control problem solution are also compared with heuristics based liming. The results, while highlighting the success of using time-dependent liming, put forth certain interesting aspects that might be helpful to a decision maker.

Based on 1-year data from the Zeya reservoir, China, we scaled the mixing depth throughout a whole year by utilizing cluster analysis, and then investigated its influence on phytoplankton dynamics and other physical and chemical parameters. Over the whole year, all physical and chemical parameters except TN and temperature had significant correlations with mixing depth, indicating that mixing depth is one of the important driving factors influencing water environment. According to mixing depth, a year can be divided into three different periods, including the thermally stratified period, isothermally mixed period, and transition period between them. When considering the former two different periods separately, mixing depth had no correlation with the phytoplankton biovolume. However, over the whole year a significant correlation was observed, which indicated that the influence of mixing depth on phytoplankton growth in the Zeya reservoir still followed Diehl's theory. Furthermore, according to the steady-state assumption, a unimodal curve (mixing depth-phytoplankton biovolume) with a significant peak appearing at a mixing depth of 2 m was observed, closely agreeing with Diehl' prediction.

J	Kaminskas, S; Humphries, P				Kaminskas, Simon; Humphries, Paul			Diet of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) (Mitchell) larvae in an Australian lowland river in low flow and high flow years	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Researchers have hypothesised that influxes of pelagic zooplankton to river channels after floods and high flows are necessary for strong recruitment of some native fish species, including Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) (Mitchell), in the Murray-Darling river system, Australia. This study investigated the composition of the diet and gut fullness of drifting Murray cod larvae weekly during two spawning seasons with contrasting flows, to determine if pelagic zooplankton comprised a greater proportion of the gut contents and guts were fuller in a high flow (2000) than in a low flow (2001) year. Gut fullness and yolk levels of 267 larvae were ranked, and prey identified to family level. Approximately 40 and 70% of individuals had been feeding in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Gut fullness increased with declining yolk reserves. Larvae in both the years had an almost exclusively benthic diet, irrespective of the flow conditions at the time. Substantial inundation of dry ground in 2000, albeit restricted to in-channel benches, anastomosing channels and oxbow lakes, did not lead to an influx of pelagic, floodplain-derived zooplankton subsequently exploited by Murray cod larvae. These results have the implications for the management of regulated temperate lowland rivers: high flows cannot automatically be assumed to be beneficial for the fish larvae of all species and their food resources, and caution should be exercised with the timing of flow releases.

The objective of the present study was to examine possible environmental factors that affect longitudinal distributional patterns of epilithic bacterial communities in 2 rivers (Yasu and Ado Rivers) draining the Lake Biwa basin, Japan. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) with oligonucleotide probes targeted to small subunit rRNA. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analysis of the DGGE profile indicated that a clear shift in community composition occurred at the middle reach of the Yasu River. This shift was most closely related to variation in the nitrogen stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) of epilithic materials (BIOENV analysis, rho(w) = 0.512), which is an indicator of the extent of anthropogenic nitrogen loading. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) also affected community composition (rho(w) = 0.510 for the combination of delta N-15 and DOC). The longitudinal pattern of the DGGE profile was less evident in the Ado River. In both rivers, FISH results indicated that Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria generally accounted for a large fraction (37 to 71%) of total bacterial abundance, indicating that species and clones affiliated with a limited number of the major phylogenetic groups occupy diverse epilithic habitats. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that nutrients and organic matter of anthropogenic origin are major determinants of epilithic bacterial community structure in rivers.

Bacterial indicator densities are also analysed throughout the catchment to assess the impacts and the potential hazards arising from agricultural activities, sewage treatment plant releases and urban runoff. The area is drained by the ephemeral Leichhardt River, which bisects Mount Isa City and the major Pb, Zn, Cu and Ag Mount Isa Mine. Runoff is captured downstream in Lake Moondarra, with the water being used following natural filtration via a lagoon-reed bed system for potable purposes by the residents of Mount Isa City. During the dry season, the channel is characterised by numerous pools that act as storage zones for sediment and water-soluble metals as well as urban and agriculturally derived nutrients and pathogens. Our results show that sediment and water quality within the Leichhardt River adjacent to and downstream of the mine frequently exceed Australian government sediment guidelines with average values of Cu, Pb and Zn found adjacent to the footprint of the mine being 1550, 510 and 470 mg kg(-1), respectively. Dry season analysis of water-soluble Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations within pools showed that Australian government low trigger guidelines are exceeded in 100, 46 and 100% cases, respectively. The densities of bacterial indicators in remnant pools throughout the Leichhardt River also exceeded acceptable guidelines. Maximum dry season faecal coliform densities of 2000 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL and Enterococcus counts of 900 organisms per 100 mL were recorded in dry season remnant pools compared to wet season maximum faecal coliform and Enterococcus densities of 119 000 CFU per 100 mL and 95 000 organisms per 100 mL, respectively. The impacts on biota were also examined by assessing the metal content of the tissue of seven fish from Lake Moondarra for their Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn concentrations. Tissue metal values were generally low with only a few samples having Cu and Zn values in excess of the recommended Australian retail guideline values for fish suitable for human consumption. The effectiveness of the City's natural reed bed potable water processing facility for removing metals held within the water body (soluble and particulate) was also assessed. The results show that the treated water generally meets Australian drinking water guidelines. Overall it is clear that sediment and water quality in the area upstream of the potable water storage zone is seriously impaired. The combined effects of industrial, agricultural and urban activities present a considerable risk to the consistency and reliability of water quality, especially during highly turbid wet season flows, which transfer highly elevated concentrations of water-soluble metal and microbial contaminants.

Fish were collected during two seasons (the rainy season in September 2000 and the dry season in May 2002) from the lakes Caracol, Rio, Enmedio, and Limon. Fish were sacrificed and EROD activities, hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticide and heavy metal concentrations were determined in the liver, while PAH metabolites and cholinesterase activity were measured in bile and muscle, respectively. Hydrocarbon concentrations in fish liver were moderately high, as compared with results reported for the other species in different coastal ecosystems in Mexico. The highest concentrations of total hydrocarbons were found in fish captured in Lake Limon, and the lowest in Lake Caracol. The highest EROD and PAH metabolites were found in fish collected from Limon and Enmedio lakes. A Spearman test showed significant negative correlations between EROD and BChE activity with fish weight. EROD correlated with total hydrocarbons, the metabolites of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene, and negatively with polychlorinated biplienyls (PCBs), endosulphan, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and pentachloroanisol. BChE activity in the four lakes was lower than the activity measured in laboratory Cultured tilapias, indicating the presence of anti-cholinergic pollutants ill the area; Caracol was the lake with the lowest enzyme activity, This study demonstrated that high concentrations of contaminants call cause effects oil fish metabolism, and that tilapia can be used as a test organism in tropical ecosystems.

J	Michaletz, PH; Sullivan, KP				Michaletz, PH; Sullivan, KP			Sampling channel catfish with tandem hoop nets in small impoundments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Because populations of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus have been difficult to sample in small impoundments. we determined whether tandem hoop net series (three nets tied in series and baited with cheese) fished for 3 d could effectively sample these populations, In 2000 we compared seasonal catch rates (catch per unit effort [CPUE], defined as the number of fish caught per series) and length frequencies (total length [TL]: mm) of channel catfish captured with two types of tandem series (long versus short bridles) and monitored the mortality of channel catfish along with the CPUE and mortality of bycatch in five lakes, Mean CPUE ranged from 12 to 194 fish/series for channel catfish and front 5 to 101 fish/series for bycatch among series types. takes, and sampling periods. Mean CPUE for channel catfish and bycatch was similar between series types and did not consistently vary with sampling period. Length frequencies of channel catfish were usually similar between series types. Mortality was low for both channel catfish (0.3% of total catch) and bycatch (8%). In 2001, using short-bridled series, we assessed gear size bias in one lake; sampled 66 lakes that are stocked annually with channel catfish fingerlings at rates of 12, 37, or 74/ha and estimated the sample sizes required for precise estimates of mean CPUE and accurate estimates of size structure. Hoop nets failed to capture channel catfish less than 250 mm TL in proportion to their abundance, Mean CPUE among 02 lakes ranged from 0,5 to 369,7 channel catfish/series and increased with stocking rate. Four lakes were excluded because of the high catch and mortality of turtles. Mean TL ranged from 276 to 403 turn among the lakes and decreased with stocking rate. For moderate precision (coefficient of variation [100-SE/mean] = 0.2) of mean CPUE, from 12 to nearly 50 series were required. and length measurements from 300 fish were necessary for accurate assessments of size structure, Tandem hoop netting provided adequate samples of channel catfish in most small impoundments, hut obtaining precise estimates of CPUE may be difficult; moreover, turtle mortality can lie problematic in some lakes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					870	878		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0870:SCCWTH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0870:SCCWTH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800017

Egg oiling was conducted at Chicago's gull colonies to reduce production and the influx of hatch-year (HY) gulls using Chicago's beaches, with a second, long-term objective of eventually reducing adult gull numbers through attrition. We also investigated swim season water quality trends through the course of this work. From 2007 to 2009, 52, 80, and 81%, of nests at the two primary nest colonies had their eggs rendered inviable by corn oil application. Counts of HY and after hatch-year (AHY) gulls were analyzed during treatment years for 10 beaches. Water quality data were available from the Chicago Park District during our three treatment years and the prior year (baseline) for 19 beaches. HY counts declined at all 10 surveyed beaches from the initial year (52% nests with oiled eggs) to subsequent years with similar to 80% of nests oiled. Overall, HY gulls numbers on beaches decreased 86% from 2007 to 2009. Decreases in beach usage by AHY gulls were not detected. Compared to pretreatment, the number of beaches with improved water quality test rates increased each year through the course of the study. The frequency of water quality tests showing bacterial exceedances compared to 2006 declined at 18 of 19 beaches by 2009. Egg oiling resulted in fewer HY gulls using Chicago's beaches and was likely a beneficial factor for reduced frequencies of swim advisories and swim bans.																			1612-9202					JUN	2012	9	2					195	204		10.1007/s10393-012-0760-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-012-0760-z								22492207					WOS:000307406100010

Two periods were recognized during the one-year investigation: one euhaline-mesotrophic from December to May and one hyperhaline-eutrophic from June to November. Nutrient limitation appears to have been important in defining the lakes' seasonal phytoplankton composition. Phosphate was most likely limiting from October to December, silicate from January to April, and nitrogen from June to September when nitrate was depleted. Diatoms were most abundant in November to January, when temperature and salinity were low and nitrate and ammonium were high. They collapsed in March when silicate was depleted. Amphora, Navicula, and other naviculoid diatoms were the most frequent genera. Nitzschia longissima was the most abundant species. Dinoflagellate dominance began in June in Mala Solina and in March in Velika Solina. It continued while temperature, salinity, phosphate, and silicate were high. Oxyrrhis marina was the most abundant dinoflagellate (3.2 x 10(6) cells L-1). Nanophytoplankton was the dominant size fraction. Chroococoid cyanobacteria were most abundant from May to October, reaching 2.9 x 10(7) cells L-1 in July. Both nanophytoplankton and small microphytoplankton, such as Oxyrrhis, Scrippsiella, and Tetraselmis, were most abundant under hyperhaline, N-depleted conditions. Toxic and harmful taxa (e.g. Alexandrium, Dinophysis), expanding in Mediterranean waters, were not recorded in the lakes.

J	Reid, DM; Anderson, DM; Henderson, BA				Reid, DM; Anderson, DM; Henderson, BA			Restoration of lake trout in Parry Sound, Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The purpose of this study was to explain how a series of management actions facilitated the restoration of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Parry Sound of Lake Huron. Since 1988, the relative abundance of wild spawning lake trout has increased in Parry Sound. Estimates of the spawning population (1994-1997) varied between 16,000 and 29,000 individuals. This increase in abundance was achieved by controlling sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus (1960), stocking yearling lake trout derived from the remnant stock (1981-1997), creating a refuge (1987), restricting harvest by reducing both angling seasons and possession limits ( 198 1), and imposing a size limit for retention (1994). By 1997, the three criteria of successful restoration were achieved, that is, the average age of mature females was I year older than the age of first maturation, wild fish composed 50% of the spawners, and the abundance of wild lake trout had been stable or increased for three consecutive years. As a consequence, stocking of yearlings was discontinued after 1997. A stochastic simulation model was developed to assess the likelihood of realizing sustainable harvests over a range of total mortality rates. We concluded that lake trout restoration is possible if sea lampreys are controlled, the appropriate strain is stocked, and exploitation is restricted, although additional limiting factors could hinder rehabilitation success in some locations of the Great Lakes.					anderson, david/E-6416-2011														0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2001	21	1					156	169		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0156:ROLTIP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0156:ROLTIP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289000016
J	Germ, M; Simcic, T				Germ, Mateja; Simcic, Tatjana			Vitality of aquatic plants and microbial activity of sediment in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Bohinj, Slovenia)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The vitality of eight macrophyte species and the microbial activity of sediment in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Bohinj, Slovenia) were studied via the terminal electron transport system (ETS) activity of mitochondria. The levels of ETS activity of vascular plants were as follows: Ranunculus circinatus. Myriohpyllum spicatum, Potamogeton alpinus, P. perfoliatus, P. lucens. Fontinalis antipyretica exhibited the highest ETS activity of the non-vascular plants, followed by charales Chara delicatula and C. aspera. High values enable R. circinatus, an amphibious species with rapid growth, to survive under conditions in which the water level changes throughout the season. M. spicatum, a species with broad ecological tolerance, also exhibited high ETS activity. The ETS activity of the microbial community in sediment was affected by temperature and/or the amount and origin of the organic matter. A positive correlation between the ETS activity of the sediment and that of M. spicatum and R. circinatus was measured, while negative correlations or no correlation were observed for mosses and macroalgae. The high ETS activity in sediment indicates rapid mineralization of organic matter and, in turn, sufficient nutrients for growth of macrophytes.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					305	312		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.305	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.305													WOS:000294320400016

Distribution of Nile perch Lates niloticus in southern Lake Victoria is determined by depth and dissolved oxygen concentrations	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Although Nile perch Lates niloticus is assumed to be sensitive to low oxygen concentrations, it was found in deep water in Lake Victoria, where oxygen depletion is common during the rainy season. Since factors determining Nile perch distribution are not well understood its spatial distribution in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria was analysed in relation to depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Of these factors, DO concentration and the interaction of depth and DO concentration explained the distribution of Nile perch, whilst temperature had no significant effect. In periods of normoxia, Nile perch preferred to stay near the bottom at depths of 12-35 m, where densities of shrimps, their main prey, were high. However, Nile perch were apparently driven away from these areas by hypoxic conditions in the rainy season. They apparently escaped the seasonally hypoxic layers in deep water by horizontal inshore migration and by vertical movement in upward direction. Sudden upwelling of these deep layers is a threat to the Nile perch stock and the Nile perch fishery.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2011	36	2					147	153		10.2989/16085914.2011.589112	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2011.589112													WOS:000299418600004

An investigation of the biological basis of return variability for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Great Central and Sproat lakes, Vancouver Island	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested whether variations in stock characteristics (spawner and smolt abundance) and biotic conditions (prey variability, predation, competition) during the early marine period explained variations in the return of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to Great Central and Sproat lakes, adjacent lakes on the west coast of Vancouver Island. There are two freshwater age groups in each lake; fish spend 1 or 2 yrs in freshwater after hatching. We tested the influences of stock and biotic factors on the return of each of the two age groups from each of the two lakes. Results of regression analyses showed that prey biomass variability best explained the variation in return for all lake-age groups. Euphausiid (Thysanoessa spinifera) and cladoceran (Evadne) prey biomass variability explained between 0.75 and 0.95 (adjusted R 2) of the variation in return. There appear to be instances of a mismatch between the seasonality of prey productivity and the apparent critical period of feeding for juvenile sockeye.																			1054-6006	1365-2419					2011	20	6					462	478		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2011.00596.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2011.00596.x													WOS:000296134400002

Largemouth Bass Nest Site Selection in Small, North Temperate Lakes Varying in Littoral Coarse Woody Habitat Abundances	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Coarse woody habitat (CWH) in the littoral zone is an important habitat feature in freshwater systems and has been suggested to influence nest density and nest site selection by black basses Micropterus spp. (e. g., largemouth bass M. salmoides and small-mouth bass M. dolomieu). To test for a relationship between nest site selection or nest density and the abundance of littoral CWH, we monitored largemouth bass nest site selection in the littoral zones of two small, northern Wisconsin lakes (comprising a total of three separated basins) for three consecutive spawning seasons. Our study sites varied in natural and manipulated abundances of CWH; spawning seasons before and after a whole-basin CWH reduction or a whole-basin CW Haddition were examined. Within-basin analysis provided some evidence that local variation in CWH abundance influenced local nest density; however, this relationship was only significant for one basin in a single season. Among basins and across seasons, we observed a positive but nonsignificant effect of littoral CWH density on nest density and inconsistent responses to the CWH manipulations. Although littoral CWH is an important habitat feature influencing fish populations, communities, and life histories, our results suggest that CWH did not directly limit largemouth bass nest densities and was not a strong driver of nest site selection in these lakes. Nevertheless, policies allowing human-mediated removals of CWH from freshwater systems may still be detrimental to fish communities and other taxa that are dependent upon CWH.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	5					943	951		10.1080/02755947.2011.633688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.633688													WOS:000297745700004

In order to obtain information on the seasonal development of the environmental conditions, water quality was determined in ten clay-pit ponds situated in the Austrian capital, Vienna. These ponds show high electrical conductivity (up to 3,000 mu S cm (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)), indicating elevated levels of salinity, which can be attributed to the geological setting of the underground. Furthermore, the ponds experience a gradient from low to high human pressure resulting from recreational activities (swimming, fishing, urbanisation of the pond boundaries). Results obtained from multivariate statistics methods suggest that ponds were mainly structured by salinity and by algal biomass, which can be attributed to resource supply related with eutrophication. According to their water chemistry, the ponds were classified as meso- to hypereutrophic. Stoichiometric N/P ratios suggest that phytoplankton productivity in hypereutrophic ponds is nitrogen limited, whilst algae in ponds with lower trophic levels experience growth imitation by phosphorus depletion. We eventually related environmental conditions to algal species occurrences and developed a model for algal assemblages indicating the particular trophic state at different seasons.

J	Schulz, HM; Schöner, A; Emeis, KC				Schulz, HM; Schöner, A; Emeis, KC			Long-chain alkenone patterns in the Baltic Sea -: an ocean-freshwater transition	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Two different patterns of long-chain alkenones are found in surficial sediments of the Baltic Sea, which is the largest brackish water body on Earth. One pattern occurs in surficial sediments from the Western Baltic Sea where surface-water salinitiy is in excess of 7.7 PSU. It corresponds to the pattern produced by the marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi with a suite of C-37 di- to tetra-unsaturated methyl ketones and C-38 di- and tri-unsaturated methyl and ethyl ketones. A second pattern, resembling that found in lake sediments in lacking C-38 methyl ketones and having distinctly higher C-37:4 methyl ketone concentrations, dominates in surficial sediments of the eastern and northern Baltic Sea, where salinities are lower than 7.7 PSU. Correspondence of sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates from the U-37(K) and U-37(K') indices (using marine calibrations) with mean SST in the euphotic zone from July-August (the main haptophyte growth season) is poor. Thus, these indices are not applicable as sedimentary thermometers in surficial sediments of the Baltic Sea. The different patterns may either reflect the salinity-dependent occurrence of specific alkenone producers or changes in the alkenone biosynthesis due to physiological stress caused by salinity variations. Furthermore, advection of saline and oxygenated North Sea water may transport marine algal material characterized by a marine E. huxleyi-like alkenone pattern into the western Baltic Sea, thus covering the signature of the local alkenone producers with a Baltic Sea pattern.

J	Jarnagin, ST; Kerfoot, WC; Swan, BK				Jarnagin, ST; Kerfoot, WC; Swan, BK			Zooplankton life cycles: Direct documentation of pelagic births and deaths relative to diapausing egg production	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton demographics operate over multiple time scales corresponding to pelagic parthenogenetic generations, an overwintering stage, and an "egg bank." Comparisons of pelagic birth and death rates with seasonal diapausing egg production provide insights into local species persistence. The spiny cladoceran (Bythotrephes) possesses morphological adaptations (spines and thick-walled diapausing eggs) that lessen, but do not eliminate, predation effects by fish. Because caudal spines are retained throughout life and are indigestible in fish guts, spine accumulation in sediment traps directly documents patterns of seasonal mortality. Here, we contrast deposition of spines and diapausing eggs in a recently colonized inland lake (Lake Michigamme) with deposition in a larger source lake (Lake Michigan). Direct mortality estimates at the inland lake correspond well with traditional indirect estimates from egg ratio techniques. Although spines are effective against abundant small fish in the inland lake, individuals are susceptible to ingestion by late-season young of year and larger fish. Laboratory experiments confirm that fish are responsible for spine breakage in the water column, accounting for an estimated 62-71% of seasonal mortality. Effects of late-season predation are lessened because diapausing eggs survive gut passage, yet yearly production of diapausing eggs is low in Lake Michigamme. A more balanced pelagic birth(death) to diapausing egg relationship exists in Lake Michigan, probably because egg-carrying adults find better refuge in central,,deeper waters. Since spines catch on seines and diapausing eggs survive gut passage, use of bait fish and live wells promotes Bythotrephes dispersal.

Lake Ossa is known as a refuge for the threatened African manatees in Cameroon. Little information exists on the water quality and health of the ecosystem as reflected by its chemical and biological characteristics. Aquatic biotic and abiotic parameters including water clarity, nitrogen, phosphorous, and chlorophyll concentrations were measured monthly during four months at each of 18 water sampling stations evenly distributed across the lake. These parameters were then compared with historical values obtained from the literature to examine the dynamic trophic state of Lake Ossa. Results indicate that Lake Ossa's trophic state parameters doubled in only three decades (from 1985 to 2016), moving from a mesotrophic to a eutrophic state. The decreasing nutrient gradient moving from the mouth of the lake (in the south) to the north indicates that the flow of the adjacent Sanaga River is the primary source of nutrient input. Further analysis suggests that the poor transparency of the lake is not associated with chlorophyll concentrations but rather with the suspended sediments brought-in by the Sanaga River. Consequently, our model demonstrated that despite nutrient enrichment, less than 5% of the lake bottom surface sustained submerged aquatic vegetation. Thus, shoreline emergent vegetation is the primary food available for the local manatee population. During the dry season, water recedes drastically and disconnects from the dominant shoreline emergent vegetation, decreasing accessibility for manatees. The current study revealed major environmental concerns (eutrophication and sedimentation) that may negatively impact habitat quality for manatees. The information from the results will be key for the development of the management plan of the lake and its manatee population. Efficient land use and water management across the entire watershed may be necessary to mitigate such issues.					; Gomes, Dylan/AAG-6419-2019; Takoukam, Aristide/KUC-9769-2024	Gomes, Dylan/0000-0002-2642-3728; 													2045-7758					NOV	2021	11	21					15212	15224		10.1002/ece3.8202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8202		OCT 2021						34765172					WOS:000705018400001
J	Franklin, J; Steadman, DW				Franklin, Janet; Steadman, David W.			Forest Plant and Bird Communities in the Lau Group, Fiji	PLOS ONE												Background: We examined species composition of forest and bird communities in relation to environmental and human disturbance gradients on Lakeba (55.9 km(2)), Nayau (18.4 km(2)), and Aiwa Levu (1.2 km(2)), islands in the Lau Group of Fiji, West Polynesia. The unique avifauna of West Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) has been subjected to prehistoric human-caused extinctions but little was previously known about this topic in the Lau Group. We expected that the degree of human disturbance would be a strong determinant of tree species composition and habitat quality for surviving landbirds, while island area would be unrelated to bird diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings: All trees >5 cm diameter were measured and identified in 23 forest plots of 500 m(2) each. We recognized four forest species assemblages differentiated by composition and structure: coastal forest, dominated by widely distributed species, and three forest types with differences related more to disturbance history (stages of secondary succession following clearing or selective logging) than to environmental gradients (elevation, slope, rockiness). Our point counts (73 locations in 1 or 2 seasons) recorded 18 of the 24 species of landbirds that exist on the three islands. The relative abundance and species richness of birds were greatest in the forested habitats least disturbed by people. These differences were due mostly to increased numbers of columbid frugivores and passerine insectivores in forests on Lakeba and Aiwa Levu. Considering only forested habitats, the relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater on the small but completely forested (and uninhabited) island of Aiwa Levu than on the much larger island of Lakeba. Conclusions/Significance: Forest disturbance history is more important than island area in structuring both tree and landbird communities on remote Pacific islands. Even very small islands may be suitable for conservation reserves if they are protected from human disturbance.																			1932-6203					DEC 29	2010	5	12							e15685	10.1371/journal.pone.0015685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0015685								21206753					WOS:000285793200037

Phosphorus removal of rural wastewater by the paddy-rice-wetland system in Tai Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												A field experiment was conducted to remove the potential eutrophication effect of P from rural wastewater (RW) during the whole rice growing season of 2007. The experiments consisted of five treatments, namely black water (BW). domestic wastewater (DW), grey water (GW), surface lake water (SW) and surface lake water without P application as a check (CK), with three replicates in a randomized block design. Commercial fertilizer and RW were applied to furnish 40 kg P ha(-1) except CK. Results showed total P (TP) concentration had significantly declined after P application, from October 15 there were no significant increases in TP concentration in the floodwater. TP removal rates from RW was significantly higher(P <= 0.05) than those from fertilizer. TP load was in an overall gradual decline, whereupon it became approximately steady on October 1. The percentage of TP load from wastewater decreased, whereas that from fertilizer continued to increase. Meanwhile, the yield for CK was significantly less (P <= 0.05) than SW, GW, DW, and BW, with the yield of BW significantly greater (P <= 0.05) than other treatments. It is feasible to remove P from RW by the paddy-rice-wetland system and can be widely used to improve the yield of rice. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Long-Term Dynamics and Seasonal Changes in Hydrochemistry of the Issyk-Kul Lake Basin, Kyrgyzstan	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												Lake Issyk-Kul is one of the largest high-altitude and brackish lakes of continental origin. The long-term dynamics of the chemical composition of the water of its basin is evaluated and analyzed based on data from 1932, 1977, and 1986. The average long-term dynamics of water salinity is determined based on data from 1928, 1960, 1980, 2000, and 2014. The predominant ions of the lake water are sulfates, chlorides, sodium, and magnesium. The predominant cations are Na+ and Mg+ , and the predominant anions are Cl- and . Sulfates predominate in the chemical composition, so the water belongs to the sulfate class and the chloride-sulfate-sodium-magnesium mineralization type. The water in the lake is alkaline; its pH ranged from 7.95 to 8.82 in 2015. The salinity of Lake Issyk-Kul is 6.22 g/L. The study of the hydrochemistry of natural waters is of great practical importance for various sectors of the economy, since the chemical composition of water is taken into account for all types of water supply and use. Hydrochemical research is also of increasing interest due to increased water-reservoir pollution and anthropogenic activity.

J	Hancock, MH; Robson, HJ; Smith, TD; Douse, A				Hancock, Mark H.; Robson, Hannah J.; Smith, Trevor D.; Douse, Andrew			Spatial and temporal patterns of foraging activity by breeding Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) in Scotland	ORNIS FENNICA												Many populations of sea ducks have declined; poor foraging conditions in freshwater breeding habitats could be a contributory factor. The UK breeding population of Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) declined by 63% between 1995 and 2007, prompting research which showed that lake use by breeding scoters was correlated with food abundance (large invertebrates) and accessibility (shallow water). Building on this earlier work, here we investigate scoter foraging activity at Scottish breeding lakes, in order to better understand declines and inform conservation measures. We hypothesised that foraging effort would (i) be concentrated in shallow water holding large invertebrates, (ii) differ between sexes, and (iii) vary through the season. We recorded scoter foraging activity during 208 c. one-hour watches, at 13 lakes over three years. Water depth and food abundance (invertebrates) were measured. Foraging was significantly associated with shallow water: areas within 10 m of lake shores, typically less than 0.9 m in depth, had 1.9 and 4.1 times more foraging use than expected by chance, for females and ducklings respectively. Where large invertebrates were relatively abundant, the association with shallow water was weaker, implying that abundant food facilitated foraging across a wider range of water depths. Contrary to expectations, males and females expended similar foraging effort on breeding lakes. We discuss various interpretations of this result, and recommend tracking studies to help resolve these. There was no evidence that foraging effort of pre-breeding females or broods varied seasonally. Our study highlights the value of shallow water and large invertebrates to breeding Common Scoters. Conservation action should therefore seek to protect and enhance these habitat elements, for example via management of water levels or fisheries.					; Robson, Hannah/KHD-0782-2024	Hancock, Mark Henry/0000-0001-6437-7278; 													0030-5685						2019	96	3					124	141																WOS:000488297000003

Community Management of Fish Refuges in Cambodian Rice-Field Fisheries	FROM CATASTROPHE TO RECOVERY: STORIES OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT SUCCESS												Home to nearly 500 aquatic species, Cambodian freshwater fisheries are among the world's most diverse (Baran 2005). These diverse fisheries support the livelihoods and the food and nutrition security of millions of Cambodian people. However, these fisheries also face a range of threats, including conflicts with dam projects that disrupt fish movement and spawning, increasing harvest pressure, and unpredictable flood seasons. Rice -field fisheries support as much as 30% of all fish catch in Cambodia and are the site of a unique management strategy that has been implemented to sustainably improve fish catch and strengthen community governance: community fish refuges (CFRs). Community fish refuges have been encouraged by the government of Cambodia and are community -managed protected areas designed to increase fish productivity and protect biodiversity. We use governance scores to examine how support for CFRs from 2012 to 2015 has improved their governance across five dimensions (structure, planning, representation, fundraising, and networking) and the relationship between governance and fish biomass within CFRs. We find some associations between the governance scores and the biomass and biodiversity of the refuges, suggesting that improving governance may affect fishery productivity in this setting. Important lessons learned include (1) that supporting community leadership and technical knowledge enables communities to better understand and justify the underlying reasons for management actions and negotiate their implementation; (2) that in changing ecosystems, community based approaches allow communities to responsively adapt to the unique, localized environmental conditions they face; (3) that community -based approaches capitalize on a community's unique knowledge of their ecological setting and community; and (4) that engagement of community leadership with the wider fisheries context is essential to facilitating and encouraging community efforts.

Variations in the Concentration of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Organochlorine Pesticides in Air over the Northern Hovsgol Region in 2008-2015	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												The variations in the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in atmospheric air in the northern Lake Hovsgol region in 2008-2015 is analyzed using passive air sampling data. It was found that the concentrations vary from background values (comparable with those for other high-mountain regions) to the levels typical of large settlements. The quantitative and qualitative variations in the concentration of PCBs and OCPs in air are recorded. The variations characterize the influence of both natural (seasonal variations in temperature and average annual temperature anomalies over the land and sea across the globe and Northern Hemisphere) and anthropogenic factors. There is a trend towards the increase in hexachlorobenzene (HCB) levels and the decrease in hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) levels in the atmosphere. No significant variation in the total PCB was found in 2011-2015. The results of the modeling of PCB and OCP fluxes in the air-soil system in the analyzed region demonstrate that deposition prevails over volatilization that corroborates the significance of atmospheric transport for the PCB and OCP inflow to the Lake Hovsgol region.

Length-volume relationship of lake phytoplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The shapes of phytoplankton units (unicellular organisms and colonies) are extremely diverse, and no unique relationship exists between their volume, V, and longest linear dimension, L. However, an approximate scaling between these parameters can be found because the shape variations within each size class are constrained by cell physiology, grazing pressure, and optimality of resource acquisition. To determine this scaling and to test for its seasonal and interannual variation under changing environmental conditions, we performed weighted regression analysis of time-dependent length-volume relations of the phytoplankton community in large deep Lake Constance from 1979 to 1999. We show that despite a large variability in species composition, the V(L) relationship can be approximated as a power law, V similar to L-alpha, with a scaling exponent alpha = 3 for small cells (L < 25 mu m) and alpha = 1.7 if the fitting is performed over the entire length range, including individual cells and colonies. The best description is provided by a transitional power function describing a regime change from a scaling exponent of 3 for small cells to an exponent of 0.4 in the range of large phytoplankton. Testing different weighted fitting approaches we show that remarkably the best prediction of the total community biovolume from measurements of L and cell density is obtained when the regression is weighted with the squares of species abundances. Our approach should also be applicable to other systems and allows converting phytoplankton length distributions (e.g., obtained with automatic monitoring such as flow cytometry) into distributions of biovolume and biovolume-related phytoplankton traits.

The study deals with the regression analysis of daily rainfall data for the period 1975-2014. The main objective of the study is on the variation of rainfall intensity, to establish a relationship between Rainy Days (RND), Mean Daily Intensity (MDI) versus Seasonal/Annual Rainfall. It is seen that, 3rd order polynomial curve fitting is a better fit due to the erratic fluctuation of rainfall in the region. The regression is compared with linear, logarithmic, exponential and power regression curve fitting. Least values of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) analysis of the residue also suggest 3rd order polynomial curve fitting as best fit. Analysis of intensity of rainfall is carried as per Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). It is observed that, very light rain and light rain intensities have significantly increased in the recent years while rather heavy and heavy rain intensities have decreased gradually. Although the average annual rainfall is normal in the region, mean daily intensity is in the decreasing trend and the number of rainy days is in the increasing trend. Hence, surface runoff may have reduced in the catchment, which is one of the factors affecting the drying of lakes/tanks in the region.																			0252-9416					JAN	2019	70	1					141	158																WOS:000478049700010

Variations in relation to hydro-meteorological variables, including rainfall, wind speed and air temperature were also measured during the field sampling. The results showed clear distinctions between natural and man-made lakes in terms of physical and chemical properties of lake waters and their relationships to the hydro-meteorological dynamic. Persistent oxygen and temperature differences between the epilimnion and hypolimnion were clearly detected in Bukit Merah reservoir under low winds and strong heat. Oxycline also persist during flooding or high turbidity levels indicating their enriched bottom waters. On the other hand, the natural Bera lake showed temporary stratification during the dry season with low winds but the water columns were thoroughly mixed during the wet season when the water temperature was lower and wind speed was higher. Plankton diversity in Bera lake was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the Bukit Merah reservoir, probably due to the much longer history of the natural lake compared to the man-made one. Due to the longer residence time of the reservoir compared to the natural lake, the former tends to be more vulnerable to eutrophication if subjected to uncontrolled nutrient enrichment.

Toxic effect and physiological disruption of sodium phosphate to the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Phosphorous is an essential nutrient for all forms of life; however, the question of toxicity to aquatic species remains largely unanswered, despite many systems that exceed natural phosphorus loads. This study determined the ecotoxicological threshold concentration of phosphorus to the freshwater bivalve Dreissena bugensis using a 96-h bioassay. Sublethal, medial lethal, and lethal levels of sodium phosphate to D. bugensis were found to be 125, 260, and 476ppm. Physiological biomarkers such as the oxygen consumption and filtration rate were estimated by exposing D. bugensis to five different sublethal concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100, and 125ppm) of sodium phosphate for 96h. Both oxygen consumption and filtration rate gradually declined with increasing exposure concentrations and durations, which was significant (<0.05) for 75, 100, and 125ppm of sodium phosphate concentrations. Based on the feeding rate and oxygen consumption endpoints, the no-observed effect concentration and the low observed effect concentration were 25 and 75ppm, respectively. Maximum acceptable toxicant concentration of sodium phosphate was 43.3ppm. Measured environmental concentration (MEC) of total phosphorus (0.015ppm; n=6) was obtained from seasonal field assessments in Saginaw Bay during the years 2008 to 2010. An assessment factor of 1000 was used for calculating the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 0.025ppm. Risk quotient (RQ) of 0.6 was therefore established using MEC/PNEC (real risk) ratio. Binary ecological classification (RQ<1) suggested that there is no appreciable risk of phosphorus to D. bungensis in the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron of Laurentian Great Lakes.

Laboratory and greenhouse response of monoecious hydrilla to fluridone	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Spread of the monoecious biotype of hydrilla (Hydra la verticillata L.f. Royle) into natural lakes and streams of northern-tier states is of concern to resource managers. In response, multiple eradication programs relying on fluridone have been initiated. Although fluridone controls monoecious hydrilla, limited quantitative information exists on effective concentrations and exposures. I conducted growth-chamber and mesocosm studies to determine sensitivity of hydrilla to various concentrations and exposures of fluridone. Sprouted hydrilla tubers were exposed to fluridone at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 48 mu g L-1 and chlorophyll fluorescence yield of apical shoots measured via a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer was reduced by over 85% at fluridone concentrations > 3 mu g L-1 Hthe response of established hydrilla to fluridone at concentrations of 3 to 48 mu g L-1. Although chorophyll fluorescence yield of apical shoots from established plants was similar to that observed in the lab tydrilla was also exposed to fluridone for intermittent periods and compared with plants that received continuous fluridone exposures. Removal of treated plants from fluridone for periods of 3 and 6 d followed by placing plants back in fluridone-treated water produced similar results through a 35-d period. Data confirm that a significant lag period exists between removal from fluridone exposure and recovery of photosynthetic pigments. I evaluated the response of sprouting tubers in greenhouse trials to fluridone at 1.5 to 12 mu g L-1. Fluridone at 6 and 12 mu g L-1 prevented hydrilla from emerging, whereas concentrations of 1.5 and 3 mu g L-1 reduced biomass by 84 to 96%. I also evaluated rials, the reduction in biomass was much slower over a 70-d period and was concentration dependent. Monoecious hydrilla is highly sensitive to fluridone and results suggest that control can be achieved via maintenance of low fluridone concentrations. Application of fluridone early in the growing season before shoot emergence or before accumulation of significant biomass is recommended to reduce overall exposure requirements.

J	Joosten, H; de Klerk, P				Joosten, Hans; de Klerk, Pim			In search of finiteness:: the limits of fine-resolution palynology of Sphagnum peat	HOLOCENE												High-resolution analysis of ombrogenous peats often reveals pollen frequencies that change markedly from one sample to the next, indicating limited postdepositional mixing. This raises the question whether - with sufficiently thin samples - seasonal differences in pollen deposition can be observed. Seasonal resolution in peat would provide a dating technique with an accuracy similar to that of other, annually banded archives. To study the limits of temporal resolution, contiguous 0.5 mm thick slices of slightly humified Sphagnum section Cuspidata peat were palynologically analysed. No seasonal patterns in the pollen stratigraphy could be observed. This is ascribed to the mixing of pollen grains as a result of small-scaled vertical water movements and to the horizontal mode of shoot layering in the Sphagnum species. The latter process may also be the cause of a smoothed annual signal. Because of the absence of seasonal differentiation, the palynological distinction of annual peat layers is not feasible.						de Klerk, Pim/0000-0003-3099-9399													0959-6836					NOV	2007	17	7					1023	1031		10.1177/0959683607082416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607082416													WOS:000251541400015
J	Valley, RD; Drake, MT				Valley, Ray D.; Drake, Melissa T.			What does resilience of a clear-water state in lakes mean for the spatial heterogeneity of submersed macrophyte biovolume?	AQUATIC BOTANY												Short-term variability of spatial heterogeneity of submersed macrophyte biovolume (percent of water column occupied by vegetation) was evaluated over 3 years along a gradient of productivity in four north temperate glacial lakes in Minnesota, USA. We hypothesized we would observe the lowest among-year variability in spatial heterogeneity of biovolume in our undisturbed, moderately productive lake and high variability in our more locally disturbed productive lakes. Our analysis involved three major steps: first, we removed negative trends of biovolume across depth with non-parametric regression smoothers; second, we examined spatial pattern in residuals using variograms; finally, we compared spatial pattern of biovolume among lakes seasonally, over 3 years. Lake productivity negatively correlated with water clarity and the depth range of macrophyte growth, and positively correlated with the variability of spatial patterns. In the least disturbed moderately productive lake, vegetation grew over a large range of depths (up to 7.5 m), and spatial pattern across the littoral zone was similar for each survey. In contrast, in the more turbid, productive lakes, depth and spatial patterns of biovolume varied greatly from survey to survey. Factors that increase productivity and weaken resilience in lakes may lead to unstable spatial patterns of macrophyte biovolume.

Bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production in seven lakes in the Middle Rio Doce basin, south-east Brazil	LIMNOLOGICA												The purpose of this study was to measure the phytoplankton production (PP) and bacterial production (BP) simultaneously in seven lakes in the middle Rio Doce basin (southeast Brazil) during the dry and the rainy seasons. Limnological monitoring was conducted from 1999 to 2001 as well as both PP (radioactive carbon fixation) and BP (H-3-Leucine incorporation) in four specific depths (100%, 10%, 1% of incident radiation, and aphotic zone). Furthermore, trophic state of the lakes was analyzed, considering the index proposed by Salas and Martino (1991) and Carlson (1977). In general, some parameters increased during the rainy season such as pH, conductivity, chlorophyll and total nitrogen. In the period of 1999/2000, the rain caused PP reduction in the lakes, excepting Carioca and Aguas Claras Lake, but in the years 2000/2001, the lakes did not show a similar pattern. In contrast, the rainy season of both years caused an expressive bacterioplankton production enhancing. Using Salas and Martino index, we observed that some lakes were affected by the seasonal runoff, therefore the typologie of these lakes changed from oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions, otherwise considering the Carlson index all lakes were classified as eutrophic in both dry and rainy seasons. Indeed, Salas and Martino index demonstrated to be more appropriate to determine the trophic status of the lakes. Finally, our data indicate that until now, in spite of the lakes location, protected and unprotected area, the lakes still maintain their natural characteristics. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Methods.-This study was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial with 400 male Nepali porters in the Mount Everest region of Nepal, trekking from Namche Bazaar (3440 m) to Lobuche (4930 m), the study endpoint. Participants were randomized to receive 250 mg acetazolamide daily or placebo, and AMS symptom scores (Lake Louise) were compared in highlanders vs lowlanders. Results.-Only 109 (27.2%) of the 400 porters completed the trial (28 highlanders, 81 lowlanders). The rest either dropped out (275/400 porters, 68.8%) or were excluded (16/400 porters, 4%). Acute mountain sickness occurred in 13 (11.9%) of 109 porters; all were lowlanders; 7 were taking acetazolamide, 6 taking placebo. Birthplace, acclimatization in the week before the trial, ascent rate, and rest days were the most important variables affecting the incidence of AMS. No highlanders, but 13 (16.1%) of 81 lowlanders had AMS (P = .016). Acclimatization in the pretrial week reduced AMS incidence (P = .013), as did a slower ascent rate (P = .0126), but rest days were the most potent prophylactic variable (P = .0001). Side effects were more frequent in porters taking acetazolamide than in the placebo group (P = .0001), but there were no serious side effects. Conclusions.-Acetazolamide was tolerable, but impractical for the routine prevention of AMS in Nepali porters. A good trekking schedule and adequate acclimatization remain the most effective preventive measures. This study identified lowland porters as a high-risk group for developing AMS.																			1080-6032	1545-1534				SUM	2006	17	2					87	93		10.1580/1080-6032-17.2.87	http://dx.doi.org/10.1580/1080-6032-17.2.87								16805144					WOS:000238243900005

We determined the concentration of dioxins of the water samples. Linear relationships between toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of dioxin and concentrations of suspended solid (SS) were obtained at sites in Kahokugata Lagoon and in the rivers flowing into the lagoon. Homologue composition of polychlorinated dibenzo-p- dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) indicated that all the water samples were still strongly influenced by chlorinated herbicides, such as chloronitrofen (CNP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) that had been widely used in rice fields. The main isomer distributions of the PCDD homologues were not significantly different among the sampling sites, while the main isomer distributions of the PCDF homologues were considerably different among the sampling sites. At a few sampling points in the downstream part of one of the rivers, high concentrations of 1,3,6,7,8-pentachloro dibenzofuran (1,3,6,7,8-PeCDF) and its related isomers (1, 3,6,8-chlorine-substituted PCDFs) were traced to a dye manufacturing plant. These non-toxic isomers are usually only minor constituents in environmental water samples and are not indicators of any known dioxin sources. The dyeing discharge was found to make a contribution only in the water samples collected near the plant and the seasonal variation of the contribution might depend on the flow rate of the river.

Theodore			Influence of limnological conditions on Clostridium botulinum type E presence in eastern Lake Erie sediments (Great Lakes, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Avian and fish botulism outbreaks have been recorded since 1999 in eastern Lake Erie. These outbreaks are caused by Clostridium botulinum type E, a toxin-producing bacteria that is found in anoxic substrates rich in organic material. We studied the environmental conditions present in eastern Lake Erie during 2002, a year when several botulism outbreaks were observed. We also tested for the presence of C. botulinum type E in lake sediments. Samples were taken at six stations from two sites of different depths in the Dunkirk (New York, USA) area. The depth of the sampling sites influenced physico-chemical and biological processes in the sediments. We used the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) to quantify the levels of C. botulinum type E in the samples. Sediment samples contained a patchy distribution of type E spore concentrations (from not detectable to 5520 DNA copies/mg). Samples of benthic invertebrates tested positive for C. botulinum type E spores in tissues (Gammarus 2028 DNA copies/mg, oligochaetes 428 DNA copies/mg, chironomids 148 DNA copies/mg and dreissenid mussels 715 DNA copies/mg). Principal components analysis (PCA) from inshore stations indicated that a decrease in dissolved oxygen, pH and redox potential near the sediment was associated to an increase in specific conductance and the type E toxin gene in sediments. We also found that C. botulinum type E spores are present in sediments at different depths and at different times through the ice-free season.

The water quality of this watershed is of great importance because it is widely used for aquaculture production, hydraulic electro-generating, recreation, fishing, and irrigation. In this study, the water quality index (WQI) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to evaluate the Spatio-temporal variations in the surface water quality of the watershed. Ten monitoring sections were selected and monitored monthly for this study. Results indicated that the Chaihe bridge section exhibited the worst water quality with a WQI score of 32.81 due to large quantities of sewage discharge. Moreover, the water quality of the Mudan River Watershed showed seasonal variations. The WQI scores in the rainy season, non rainy season, and icebound season were 69.38, 70.99, and 41.96, which was due to the surface water runoff in the rainy season as well as the low temperature and bacterial activity in the icebound season. Furthermore, the PCA technique revealed that permanganate index and ammonia nitrogen were the primary contaminants of this watershed regardless of the season. Therefore, it is urgent to restore the water quality of the Mudan River Watershed by adopting powerful management measures and improvement methods.

The formation of the lakes varied over time and was determined by many hydrogeochemical and biological factors, which resulted in very diverse ecosystems. Thirty of these lakes were studied in the vegetation seasons of 2016 and 2017. The aim of the study was to identify the main factors influencing the diversity of macrophyte vegetation growing under very extreme and diversified habitat conditions. Therefore, in each lake the numbers of macrophyte species and communities were determined, and the water was characterized by 26 physico-chemical parameters and Chl a. Additionally, the genesis, age, area and maximum depth of each lake was determined. The results showed high diversity of habitat conditions. Based on the physical and chemical water properties, four different clusters of lakes were distinguished. The multiple statistical comparisons showed that the main factors responsible for lake differentiation were pH, water mineralization and to a lesser extent, nutrient concentration and water transparency. The physico-chemical differentiation was reflected in the significant differences in the number of species, number of communities, maximum vegetation extent and amount of chlorophyll-a per lake. The correlational analyses confirmed significant relationships between habitat conditions and macrophyte flora diversity in the lakes. Some macrophyte species were found in very extreme environments not previously reported in the literature. Our results showed that in addition to natural processes affecting species diversity in the lakes, the negative impact of anthropogenic pressures (neutralization and fertilization of the water), which leads to the degradation of their unique character, is also an important factor.

Direct measurement of NEP in freshwater lakes is, however, time-consuming, and high frequency monitoring of diel variations in oxygen levels for metabolism estimation has only recently been commonly employed. However, midday snap-shot oxygen data is available from numerous monitoring programs worldwide, occasionally covering decades. We hypothesize that midday oxygen saturation levels may provide information on NEP in lakes as oxygen super-saturation, indicative of high NEP, is observed in very productive lakes, whereas very low oxygen levels may occur in lakes with great input of organic matter or in lakes experiencing sudden decline in primary producers, indicative of low NEP. By analysis of a high frequency dataset encompassing 24 fully mixed mesocosms with contrasting trophic states and temperatures, we show that midday oxygen saturation provides a reasonable description of daily NEP only marginally affected by trophic state, temperature, and season. Oxygen sampling conducted in the afternoon gave a slightly better prediction than at midday, whereas predictions based on NEP representing an average of the previous 3 days led to a 2-fold increase in R-2. Moreover, an analysis of high frequency data sampled in a shallow Danish lake suggests that the method is transferable to natural shallow lakes. This method may therefore allow estimation of NEP based on oxygen measurements available from monitoring programs.

The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in the surface water ranged from 29 to 1476 mu atm and was undersaturated for atmospheric CO2 during the observation periods, although most coastal waters were net source areas because of the large amount of terrestrial organic and inorganic carbon input. Since there was a strong negative correlation between pCO(2) and the dissolved oxygen, seasonal and temporal variations in pCO(2) were mainly derived from phytoplankton activity. The high phytoplankton activity induced by the effluents from sewage treatment plants, which was low in carbon and high in nitrogen. Therefore, in urbanized coastal waters with sewage treatment plants, such as the coastal waters of Japan, there is a possibility of shifting from weaker carbon dioxide source areas to sink areas. However, pCO(2) was oversaturated at the polluted river mouth, especially after high precipitation events due to the large carbon supply.

Mean distance moved by lake trout varied among management units. Mean movement distance was lower for fish recaptured during the spawning season than for fish recaptured during the nonspawning season for three of four tagged populations, and the spatial distribution of recapture percentages differed between recapture seasons. On average, lake trout recaptured during the nonspawning season traveled 42 km while at liberty. Lake trout tagged in two of six management units emigrated to the east and west in equal percentages, but lake trout did not emigrate from the tagging unit to other management units at equal percentages. Movement distance varied significantly with time at liberty for lake trout tagged in one management unit, but did not vary significantly with length, age, time at liberty, sex, or origin for those tagged in other management units. Lake Superior fishery managers can use our results to account for lake trout movements between management units when calculating sustainable harvest levels with catch-at-age modeling.

Tracking bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms: A dynamic model integrating life history characteristics and environmental change	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					Euopean Conference on Ecological Modelling	2007	Trieste, ITALY					We have developed a dynamic model to track the evolution of contaminant concentration in an aquatic organism as a function of season and ontogeny throughout its life cycle. We have focused our analysis on the round goby (Apollonia metanostoma). a globally distributed invasive forage fish. By integrating bioenergetics with a bioaccumulation model, we illustrate how life history characteristics interact to influence contaminant accumulation. We use uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to assess how the model output is affected by uncertainty and variability in model parameters. We then demonstrate the influence of important physiological characteristics on contaminant accumulation with two scenarios. First, we probe the influence of sexual dimorphism by comparing gender-specific accumulation of a standard polychlorinated biphenyl congener, PCB153, in male and female round gobies. We hypothesize that lipid loss in female gobies during spawning season leads to a decrease in the PCB body burden compared to male gobies. Second, we compare PCB accumulation in the round goby and in the mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi), the native forage fish that the round goby displaced in southern Lake Michigan, to determine whether the invasive species has an intrinsically different bioaccumulation potential than the native one. Our non-intuitive findings from these simulations illustrate how the interaction of growth rate with other life history characteristics lead to unexpected bioaccumulation patterns. The model we present is a flexible tool that integrates complex and dynamic interactions among environmental parameters, thus providing a means to better assess the potential for chemical accumulation in human and wildlife populations, and aiding the development of ecological forecasts.

This paper reports initial project results, specifically relating to themes of architecture, foodways, specialized production, and belief systems. Exceptional preservation of organic materials such as faunal and botanical remains, as well as bone tools, permits an expansive description of the material culture relating to household level consumption. Through the intensive coverage of 5 ha of the site center, including 10 house mounds, we see that intra-site variation also reflects community, organization.

J	Paavel, B; Arst, H; Reinart, A				Paavel, Birgot; Arst, Helgi; Reinart, Anu			Variability of bio-optical parameters in two North-European large lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The bio-optical properties of some North-European large lakes were examined during 1995-2005 using field data and laboratory measurements. The key variables were optically active substances (OAS: chlorophyll, total suspended matter and dissolved organic matter), Secchi depth, and the "spectrometric" and diffuse light attenuation coefficients. Our main study sites were Lake Peipsi and Lake Vortsjarv in Estonia, both eutrophic with mean Secchi depth below 3 m. The measured water parameters were compared with those obtained from two clear-water Swedish lakes, Lake Vanern and Lake Vattern. This comparison describes the bio-optical differences of the water in eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes. The variability of water parameters in the turbid Estonian lakes was rather high, e.g. the chlorophyll content varied from 1.8 to 102 mg m(-3) and the diffuse light attenuation coefficient from 0.92 to 6.5 m(-1). The change in water properties depends on the season and the biological activity of phytoplankton. We found no apparent long-time trend in water properties. Regression analysis showed that in the turbid Estonian lakes the optical properties were well correlated with chlorophyll and suspended matter, but not with dissolved organic matter. The highest determination coefficients (between 0.73 and 0.89) were obtained when the optical parameters were correlated with all three OAS together (multiple regressions). Our results concerning the variability and interconnections among bio-optical parameters in two Estonian large lakes illustrate the effect of OAS and light field on the ecological conditions of lakes in general.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	599						201	211		10.1007/s10750-007-9200-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9200-4													WOS:000252890800025
J	Alvarez, M				Alvarez, Miguel			Classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation in two East African sites: Cocktail definitions and syntaxonomy	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems providing valuable services to people living around them. Among various uses, agricultural production (cultivation and grazing) is the most frequent activity affecting the ecotone between dry land and wetland. A classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation focussing on less disturbed plant phytocoenoses may be a useful tool for further assessments of integrity of ecological functioning of wetlands. Study area: Southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, Kenya, and western slopes of the West Usambara Mts., Tanzania. Methods: Spontaneous vegetation at the two wetland sites was surveyed using 86 sampling plots. Vegetation units resulting from a supervised classification were defined as phytosociological associations and placed in a syntaxonomic scheme after a thorough review of previous studies on the African continent and in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. Results: Identified associations of aquatic vegetation were classified to the classes Lemnetea and Potametea, while associations of semi-aquatic vegetation belong to the classes Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea and Oryzetea sativae. Five associations (Ipomoeo aquaticae-Typhetum domingensis, Leersio hexandrae-Cyperetum exaltati, Pycreo polystachyos-Panicetum subalbidum, Ammannio prieurianae-Ethulietum conyzoides and Centrostachyo aquaticae-Persicarietum senegalensis) are described as new for East Africa. Conclusions: The classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation in the two study sites complements and improves previous classifications in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere in Africa. The compilation of available information in a vegetation-plot database may help to consolidate the syntaxonomical classification in the African continent and across the tropics.																			0340-269X	2363-7153					2017	47	4					345	364		10.1127/phyto/2017/0078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/phyto/2017/0078													WOS:000419188100003

Verification of a numerical growth model of Pistia stratiotes L. using field data from tropical and subtropical sites	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The growth model of Pistia stratiotes L. (Pistia-model) was verified using two independent sets of published field data (07 degrees 26' N, 03 degrees 53' E Nigeria; 27 degrees 30' N, 80 degrees 30' W USA) to answer the following question: Is the Pistia-model, originally designed for P. stratiotes under natural conditions in Egypt, suitable to simulate the growth of P. stratiotes in tropical and subtropical regions? The Pistia-model simulates the growth dynamics and biomass production of well-established, monospecific stands of P. stratiotes based on fixed carbon gain and loss using first-order differential equations. General trends for shoots biomass, such as the slow initial growth rate followed by a high growth rate, the peak biomass, and the decline of biomass due to senescence, were successfully reproduced by the Pistia-model. Many characteristics typical for the roots biomass, such as the increase in the roots biomass during the early growing season because of the translocation of materials from shoots, and the reduction of roots biomass during the later period of the season, were also reproduced. The level of agreement between the simulated values and actual field data indicated that the Pistia-model can simulate the biomass of P. stratiotes over a wide range of latitudes.					; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013	Eid, Ebrahem/0000-0003-2452-4469; 													0270-5060	2156-6941					2017	32	1					391	403		10.1080/02705060.2017.1319430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2017.1319430													WOS:000401719600002

Walter			Variable respiration rates of incubated permafrost soil extracts from the Kolyma River lowlands, north-east Siberia	POLAR RESEARCH												Thawing permafrost supplies dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic systems; however, the magnitude, variability and fate of this DOC is not well constrained. Our objective was to examine DOC respiration from seasonally thawed and near-surface (<1.5 m) permafrost soils collected from five locations in the Kolyma River Basin, north-east Russia. We measured soil organic carbon (OC) content, water-soluble macronutrients (DOC, NH4, PO4) and the heterotrophic respiration potentials of soil extract DOC in five-day laboratory incubations. DOC concentrations ranged from 2.8 to 27.9 mg L-1 (n = 14). Carbon respiration was 0.03-0.47 mg C (n = 16) and 8.7-31.4%, total DOC (n = 14). While DOC concentration was a function of soil OC concentration, we did not find a relationship between C respiration and soil OC or DOC concentrations. Respiration was highest in the top active layer, but varied widely among sites, and lowest at the bottom of the active layer. Respiration from yedoma varied across sites (0.04-0.47 mg C respired, 8.7-31.4% total DOC). Despite the small sample size, our study indicates near-surface soils and permafrost are spatially variable in terms of both soil OC content and C respiration rates, and also that OC contents do not predict C respiration rates. While a larger sample size would be useful to confirm these results at broader geographic scales, these initial results suggest that soil OC heterogeneity should be considered in efforts to determine the fate of soil OC released from permafrost-dominated terrestrial ecosystems to aquatic ecosystems following permafrost thaw.					; Spektor, Valentin/J-9015-2018; Davydov, Sergei/S-9906-2018; Davydova, Anna/AAI-2484-2021; Davydova, Anna/Z-1002-2019	Davydov, Sergei/0000-0003-0820-9426; Spektor, Valentin/0000-0002-7791-0972; Davydova, Anna/0000-0002-3434-1749; Heslop, Joanne/0000-0002-8243-4456; Davydova, Anna/0000-0002-6689-5121													0800-0395	1751-8369					2017	36								1305157	10.1080/17518369.2017.1305157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17518369.2017.1305157													WOS:000402363000001

Basal carbon sources and planktonic food web in a tropical lake: an isotopic approach	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Trophic connections among habitats may be central to food-web dynamics in lakes. Lacustrine zooplankton can rely on basal carbon (C) sources from different origins and plays an important link between these and organisms in higher trophic levels. We investigated the basal C sources supporting the planktonic food web and the trophic relationships among zooplankton size fractions in a tropical lake (Carioca) in Brazil. To do so, we measured the C and nitrogen (N) stable-isotope ratios in basal C sources originated in terrestrial, littoral, and pelagic habitats and in zooplankton size fractions, and data were analysed through Bayesian mixing models. Mesozooplankton showed seasonal variation in resource use, specifically a smaller dependence on algae in the wet than in the dry season. In the wet season, mesozooplankton relied more on the detritivore food chain eating mostly microzooplankton (mode: 95.1%), which in turn consumed mostly terrestrial C in this season (mode: 74.7%). Zooplankton size fractions also occupied different relative trophic positions between seasons. These variations seem to follow the seasonal dynamics of in-lake primary production and of terrestrial C inputs. Also, all size fractions of zooplankton, and particularly Chaoboridae larvae, showed low C staple-isotope values, suggesting the consumption of a missing C source.					; Martinelli, Luiz/F-7870-2011; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019	Reis, Paula CJ/0000-0001-6940-0545; Martinelli, Luiz/0000-0002-7103-7551; Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	3					429	441		10.1071/MF14322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF14322													WOS:000396038400003
J	Smith, LN				Smith, Larry N.			Repeated sedimentation and exposure of glacial Lake Missoula sediments: A lake-level history at Garden Gulch, Montana, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Glaciolacustrine sediments record lake transgression, regression, and subaerial modification of the silty lake-bottom of glacial Lake Missoula in the Clark Fork River valley. The sequence preserved at Garden Gulch, MT documents lake-level fluctuations at >65% of its full-pool volume. Twelve sedimentary cycles fine upwards from (1) very fine-grained sandy silt to (2) silt with climbing ripples to (3) rhythmically laminated silt and some clay. The cycles are fine-grained turbidites capped locally by thin layers of angular gravel derived from local bedrock outcrops. The gravels appear to be the toes of mass wasting lobes carried onto the exposed lakebed surface during repeated lake-level lowerings. Periglacial wedges, small rotational faults, involutions, and clastic dikes deform the tops of eleven cycles. The wedges are 10-30 cm wide, penetrate 30-70 cm deep, are spaced <1 m apart, and contain vertically oriented gravel and massive to laminated sediment. Wedges split and taper in plan view. A few thin silt-filled dikes, which branch and taper downwards from wedges, are interpreted as filled frost cracks. One 10-20 cm-wide sand-filled dike protrudes upward from a sand bed; it is interpreted as a liquefaction feature consistent with a filling and draining lake. The deformed cycle tops preserve evidence of periglacial cold, subaerial exposure, seasonal frost heave, and the incipient formation of sorted polygons. The lowest five cycles are thicker and display more periglacial modification at their tops than the upper seven cycles. The Garden Gulch section may represent as few as seven and as many as twelve substantial fillings and partial to complete drainings of glacial Lake Missoula. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An update for cladoceran fauna (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) from Lake Paranoa, Central Brazil, with the first description of a male of Leydigiopsis ornata Daday, 1905	NAUPLIUS												Until recently, Lake Paranoa was considered the most thoroughly studied aquatic environment in relation to cladocerans in the Federal District. However, in new samplings carried out during the dry and rainy seasons of 2014, we found 10 new records of species. These species were presumed to occur in Lake Paranoa because of their range of geographical distribution. The male of Leydigiopsis ornata Daday, 1905 is described for the first time, adding new morphological traits to a recent redescription of the species. The presence of three rows of setulae on the labral keel is unique to the L. ornata male. As is the case in females, the male of L. ornata is mainly differentiated from L. megalops Sars, 1901 and L. curvirostris Sars, 1901 by the morphology of the postabdomen.

The beach of the lake contributes significantly in controlling floods and supporting ecosystems in the middle reach of the Yangtze River. However, adequately monitoring changes in the beach area is difficult because of great fluctuations in the water level, rapid sedimentation, and intensive human activities. We monitored the seasonal change of the lake beach area from 1993 to 2011 by combining changes in lake beach topography and water-level variations based on remote sensing and hydrological data. Results showed that beach area exhibited a significant increasing trend in the wet season. The lake beach area in the wet season was at its lowest in 1999 and highest in 2011, whereas in the dry season, it was lowest in 2008, with a peak value in 1999. The seasonal difference of the lake beach area was maximum in 1999 and minimum in 2011. Deposition decreased with elevation on the lake beach. The middle-low level beach was deposition based, whereas the middle-high level beach was erosion based. Given the topographic change of the beach, the lake beach expansion rate may slow down.

Both locations support important fisheries in which Heterotis is the principal target species during the flood period. Ripe adults comprised over 40% of the population in Lake Hlan, whereas only 3.5% of individuals captured from river sites were adults. Monthly averages for the gonadosomatic index and percentages of individuals with mature gonads peaked as water levels increased during the wet season then declined during the peak flood period. Oocyte size frequency distributions from ovaries suggested a potential to produce an additional cohort in the event of nesting disruption. During the peak spawning period (May to August), between 37 and 51 active nests per hectare per month were observed in Lake Hlan. The number of larvae per nest ranged from 3953 to 6125. Lake Hlan bonytongues appear to constitute an important source subpopulation that exports new recruits to river/floodplain areas downstream where intense fisheries harvest mostly juveniles and subadults. Consequently, restriction of harvest of adult bonytongues in Lake Hlan may be essential for sustenance of commercial fishing in downstream reaches of the So River.

In the sampling area (brackish lagoons of the French Mediterranean coast), 92% of the host sample (1251 eels covering all size classes) showed pathological signs of infection. The general trend was for increasing damage as eel size increased, thus suggesting accumulation of pathological effects. We also revealed a non-linear relationship bettween the swimbladder index and the abundance of living worms. In particular, we showed that severely damaged swimbladders harboured very few living nematodes. We argue that the swimbladder degenerative index more closely reflects the parasite pressure than does classic parasite count. We found seasonal variation in the swimbladder index, with maximum damage occurring in July and thereafter a trend for healthly individuals. We discuss the possibility that the seasonal decrease in the swimbladder index could reflect the death of the more severely affected individuals during the warmest months.					; Lefebvre, Francois/B-8128-2008	Lefebvre, Francois/0009-0002-9143-1799; 													0031-1820					APR	2002	124		4				457	463		10.1017/S0031182001001378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182001001378								12003069					WOS:000175266500011

A simulation model for nitrogen cycling in natural rooted papyrus wetlands in East Africa	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) wetlands around East African lakes provide important ecosystem services, including retention of nutrients, to millions of people. To understand the processes contributing to nitrogen retention in the wetland and to evaluate the effects of papyrus harvesting, a dynamic model for carbon and nitrogen cycling in rooted papyrus wetlands was constructed. The model consisted of sub-models for the permanently (P) and seasonally (S) flooded zones and was based on data from a papyrus wetland in Naivasha, Kenya. In each zone, water, nitrogen and carbon flows were calculated based on descriptions of hydrological (river flow, lake level, precipitation, evaporation) and ecological (e.g. photosynthesis, nitrogen uptake, mineralisation, nitrification) processes. Literature data were used for parameterization and calibration. The model simulated realistic concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and papyrus biomass density of papyrus. Daily harvesting up to about 84 (S-zone) and 60 (P-zone) g/m(2) days dry weight reduced the aboveground biomass and increased nitrogen retention (expressed as ) to 38 % (S-zone) and 50 % (P-zone). A further increase in daily harvesting resulted in collapse of the aboveground biomass. Papyrus biomass, however, recovered fully from annual harvesting of up to 100 % of the biomass. The model showed that papyrus re-growth after harvesting is nitrogen-limited in the P-zone.

We considered the absorption factors that affect UV attenuation, and clarified the contribution of the absorption of suspended particles and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by multiple regression analyses of the monitoring data. The variability of UV attenuations in the lake demonstrated a strong contrast between the pelagic and the shallow zones. The latter were characterized by turbid systems supplying suspended matter as well as CDOM, whereas the former was far from the turbid systems in the littoral zone or the lake bottom. In this lake, the regulation of UV and light attenuations is rendered competitive by the absorption of suspended particles and CDOM in the lake water, hence, the UV penetration has both spatial and temporal variability based on changes in the physical and biological condition of the lake.

Both ecosystems are located on the Tera river course (NW Spain), which runs along an area of ancient metamorphic and plutonic rocks. Some physical and chemical parameters, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biovolume were studied from monthly samples collected at different depths during the periods 1987-1989 (Lake Sanabria) and 1991-1992 (Valparaiso). Phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll a concentration were about five times higher in Valparaiso than in Lake Sanabria. Species composition (and main phytoplankton groups) were different. Valparaiso was highly dominated by diatoms and Lake Sanabria by cryptophytes and small chlorophytes. In spite of the fact that both sires were nitrogen limited, heterocystous cyanophytes (Annbaena sp.) were detected only in Valparaiso. The relationships between phytoplankton structure and trophic level, hydrological conditions and nitrate content are discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 15	2000	424						25	37		10.1023/A:1003940625437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003940625437													WOS:000088483000004
J	Geyh, MA; Schotterer, U; Grosjean, M				Geyh, MA; Schotterer, U; Grosjean, M			Temporal changes of the 14C reservoir effect in lakes	RADIOCARBON					16th International Radiocarbon Conference	JUN, 1997	GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS	Royal Netherlands Acad Sci, Groninger Universiteitsfonds				Conventional radiocarbon dates for sediment samples from aquatic systems and of coeval terrestrial samples deviate from each other due to the reservoir effect. The reservoir correction is usually assumed to be constant with time for a specific aquatic system. Our studies confirm that seasonal and secular changes are frequent and are governed by the limnological conditions. Lakes have two principal sources of C-14: atmospheric CO2 and the total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) of the entering groundwater and runoff. The former has values of ca. 100 pMC; the latter usually has a C-14 value well below 100 pMC. Atmospheric CO2 enters the lake by exchange via its surface. The proportions of these two kinds of input determine the magnitude of the reservoir correction in freshwater lakes. It is mainly a function of the volume/surface ratio of the lake and, consequently a function of the water depth. The surface of lakes with outflow does not change when sedimentation decreases the depth of the water. The depth of Schleinsee Lake in southern Germany has decreased from 30 to 15 m since ca. 9000 BP. As a result, the reservoir correction has decreased from ca. -1550 to -580 yr. In contrast, the depth of Lake Proscansko in Croatia increased with growth of the travertine dam and the reservoir correction changed from ca. -1790 to -2650 yr during the last 8800 yr. The largest fluctuations of lake levels occur in closed lakes in arid regions when the climate changes from humid to arid and vies versa. As a result, the reservoir correction of the C-14 dates for the total organic fraction from Lejia Lake in the Atacama Desert of Chile varied between <-1800 yr and -4700 yr over a period of only 1800 yr between 11,500 and 9700 BP. The corresponding reservoir correction for the marl fraction is much higher. In summary, accurate and reliable C-14 dating of lake sediments requires a study of the temporal changes of the reservoir effect by analysis of both the organic and marl fractions. The most reliable C-14 dates are obtained from terrestrial plant remains.																			0033-8222						1998	40	2	2		SI		921	931		10.1017/S0033822200018890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200018890													WOS:000075550800040

Investigations were conducted in the Bautzen Reservoir, Germany, (biomanipulated, macrophyte cover <1%) and in Lake Ring, Denmark (nonbiomanipulated, macrophyte cover ca. 20%). Fish were sampled regularly using trawl nets and gill nets. We focused our study on seasonal diet patterns. Further, we investigated size-related feeding and predation on both the juvenile fish and invertebrate communities. The availability of Chironominae was high in both takes (e.g. ca. 1500 ind. m(-2) in Lake Ring), but age-0 fish abundance was most probably higher in Bautzen Reservoir (6.4 individuals m(-3) in the beginning of June 1998). Invertebrates and age-0 fish were the main food components of large perch of both populations. Mean lengths of prey fish were consistently smaller than those in situ. Large perch in Bautzen Reservoir started earlier to feed on age-0 fish, which was not related to prey fish sizes. Predation on the age-0 fish community was distinctly higher in Bautzen Reservoir than in Lake Ring. Generally, invertebrates represented the most important food of large perch in Lake Ring, whereas the by far dominant food resource of large perch in Bautzen Reservoir was the age-0 fish stock. In conclusion, it can be stated that the prey fish availability was an important factor in determining the feeding behaviour of large perch.

J	Maloof, AC; Kellogg, JB; Anders, AM				Maloof, AC; Kellogg, JB; Anders, AM			Neoproterozoic sand wedges: crack formation in frozen soils under diurnal forcing during a snowball Earth	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Thermal contraction cracking of permafrost produced sand-wedge polygons at sea level on the pateo-equator during late Neoproterozoic glacial episodes. These sand wedges have been used as evidence for high (greater than or equal to54degrees) paleoobliquity of the Earth's ecliptic, because cracks that form wedges are hypothesized to require deep seasonal cooling so the depth of the stressed layer in the ground reaches greater than or equal to 1 m, similar to the measured depths of cracks that form wedges. To test the counter hypothesis that equatorial cracks opened under a climate characterized by a strong diurnal cycle and low mean annual temperature (snowball Earth conditions), we examine crack formation in frozen ground subject to periodic temperature variations. We derive analytical expressions relating the Newtonian viscosity to the potential crack depth, concluding that cracks will form only in frozen soils with viscosities greater than similar to 10(14) Pa s. We also show numerical calculations of crack growth in frozen soils with stress- and temperature-dependent rheologies and find that fractures may propagate to depths 3-25 times the depth of the thermally stressed layer in equatorial permafrost during a snowball Earth because the mean annual temperature is low enough to keep the ground cold and brittle to relatively great depths.

The evaluation is based on: (1) results from a long-term monitoring program conducted on the lake, its tributaries, and the adjoining river that receives the lake's outflow, (2) algal bioassay experiments of the bioavailability of particulate P (PP) in inputs to the lake, (3) loading rate calculations for forms of P in these inputs, (4) calculations of water densities in inflows and the take, (5) model analyses of plunging interflows and responses to seasonal material loading, and (6) mass balance calculations for a tracer conducted around the lake outlet and the receiving river to estimate inflow to the lake from the river. Several important system-specific characteristics were found not to be accommodated in the current TMDL analysis, including: (1) a P load from the river back into the lake, (2) seasonal plunging of tributaries to depths below the productive layers of the take, (3) incomplete and different bioavailabilities of PP in the various inputs, (4) the different settling velocities of PP from these sources, (5) false high estimates of TP loading from tributaries associated with turbidity interferences in P analyses, and (6) the implications of the high flushing rate of the lake for strong seasonality in the relative impacts of externals loads. The TMDL analysis is demonstrated to understate the present role of the dominant point source and overstate the importance of non-point sources. Recommendations are made to upgrade the TMDL analysis through an integrated program of model development, testing and application, supporting process studies and monitoring, and re-evaluation of management options.																			1040-2381					JUN	2002	18	2					87	108		10.1080/07438140209354140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140209354140													WOS:000178729600001
J	Izzo, LK; Parrish, DL; Zydlewski, GB				Izzo, Lisa K.; Parrish, Donna L.; Zydlewski, Gayle Barbin			Multi-run migratory behavior of adult male lake sturgeon in a short river	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) can migrate long distances to spawn, but many populations currently spawn in systems where the length of accessible riverine migratory habitat has been greatly reduced by dam construction. With the increased prevalence of shortened rivers, focusing on migratory dynamics in short rivers (<30 km) is beneficial to understanding the migratory needs of lake sturgeon populations. Here we document male lake sturgeon movements during the spawning period in the Winooski River, Vermont, USA; a river with only 17 km to the first natural upstream barrier. Male lake sturgeon were acoustically tagged (n = 25, 1215-1470 mm TL) and tracked using five to nine stationary receivers from 2017 to 2019. River discharge, temperature, the lagged effect of temperature (3-day), and time of day were significant factors describing upstream movements of tagged fish. Migrating male lake sturgeon (n = 10 in 2017, n = 18 in 2018, and n = 17 in 2019) displayed general movement patterns during the spawning period that included a single run upstream to the spawning site (60%), upstream and downstream movements throughout the river during the season (20%), or multiple runs made up the entire length of the spawning tributary to the spawning site (20%). No multi-run males were observed during 2018 when discharge was less flashy (i.e., fewer steep increases and declines in discharge) than in 2017 and 2019. These results suggest that the prevalence of multi-run spawning behavior of male lake sturgeon is related to flow conditions.

J	Bekker, MF; Taylor, AH				Bekker, MF; Taylor, AH			Gradient analysis of fire regimes in montane forests of the southern Cascade range, Thousand Lakes Wilderness, California, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY												Species distribution and abundance patterns in the southern Cascades are influenced by both environmental gradients and fire regimes. Little is known about fire regimes and variation in fire regimes may not be independent of environmental gradients or vegetation patterns. In this study, we analyze variation in fire regime parameters (i.e., return interval, season, size, severity, and rotation period) with respect to forest composition, elevation, and potential soil moisture in a 2042 ha area of montane forest in the southern Cascades in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness (TLW). Fire regime parameters varied with forest composition, elevation, and potential soil moisture. Median composite and point fire return intervals were shorter (4-9 yr, 14-24 yr) in low elevation and more xeric white fir (Abies concolor)-sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and white fir-Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi) and longest (20-37 yr, 20-47 yr) in mesic high elevation lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and red fir (Abies magnifica)-mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forests. Values for mid-elevation red fir-white fir forests were intermediate. The pattern for fire rotation lengths across gradients was the same as for fire return intervals. The percentage of fires that occurred during the growing season was inversely related to elevation and potential soil moisture. Mean fire sizes were larger in lodgepole pine forests (405 ha) than in other forest groups (103-151 ha). In contrast to other parameters, fire severity did not vary across environmental and compositional gradients and >50% of all forests burned at high severity with most of the remainder burning at moderate severity. Since 1905, fire regimes have become similar at all gradient positions because of a policy of suppressing fire and fire regime modification will lead to shifts in landscape scale vegetation patterns.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				JUL	2001	155	1					15	28		10.1023/A:1013263212092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013263212092													WOS:000172718700002

Sampling encompassed both ice-free and ice-covered periods at different water column depths. High HCH concentrations were found in all lakes, those in the Alps and Pyrenees (990-2900 pg/L) being among the highest recorded in continental waters. Endosulfans and endosulfan sulfate (120-1150 pg/L) were the second major group of organochlorine contaminants, showing a remarkable stability upon atmospheric long-range transport. The concentrations of HCB, DDTs, and PCB (4-8, 0.6-16, and 26-110 pg/L, respectively) were low in comparison with other continental waters. Hexachlorocyclohexanes, endosulfans, and HCB were essentially found in the dissolved phase. Phase partitioning of the more hydrophobic compounds exhibited a dependence on temperature and water-suspended particles. Companson between different sampling seasons and water depths indicated a remarkable concentration uniformity within lake, but major interlake differences. Normalization to turnover rates showed higher interlake similarity. Preferential accumulation of the less volatile compounds in the Alp lake and significant increase of baseline contributions of organochlorine compounds and residues in the Caledonian lake are also evidenced from these turnover rates.

J	Wainwright, J; Ayala, G				Wainwright, John; Ayala, Gianna			Holistic approaches to palaeohydrology: Reconstructing and modelling the Neolithic River carsamba and the riverscape of catalhoyuk, Turkey	HOLOCENE												Alluvial landscapes have long been considered optimal locations for Neolithic settlement because of the availability of water and nutrient-bearing silts. However, the dynamics of these landscapes have often been underestimated in relation to the interactions of precipitation, temperature and vegetation at catchment scale, along with flow and geomorphic processes in the channel and adjacent areas. In this paper we employ a multi-method approach to model the alluvial landscape around catalhoyuk in central Turkey to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential interactions between the Neolithic population and its environment. Starting from detailed sedimentological reconstructions of the area surrounding the site, we use climate and vegetation proxies to estimate past climate scenarios. Four temperature and five precipitation scenarios and two vegetation endmember scenarios were constructed for the Neolithic. These scenarios are coupled with a stochastic weather generator to simulate past flows using the HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model. Impacts and extents of past flooding are then estimated using bankfull flow estimates from the modelled time series. The model results suggest that crops at catalhoyuk were less vulnerable to flooding than has previously been supposed, with flooding spread more evenly through the year and with relatively unerosive flows. Spatial variability suggests a range of wet and dry conditions would have been available at different times of the year near the site. Interannual and decadal variability was important and so resilience against drought is also a significant consideration and so subsistence patterns must have been resilient to this variability to enable the settlement to continue for over a millennium. This interpretation of the riverscape of Neolithic catalhoyuk as a mosaic of wet and dry conditions is compatible with the range of plant and animal remains excavated from the site.

Methods Food surveys were carried out in 7 7 households at the floodplain area (Ituqui Island), located in the Municipality of Santarem, and in 17 households at the terra firme area (Caxiuana National Forest), located in the Municipalities of Melgaco and Portel. Household food consumption data were collected using the 24-hour food recall method. Data analysis was run in Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 12.0. Results The results confirm, in both ecosystems, the central roles of fish and manioc in the local diet. Nevertheless, other secondary food items, e.g. acai (in Caxiuana) and milk (in Ituqui) are also important. In addition, sugar stands out as a reliable household energy source to cope with the extreme seasonality of rain forest natural resources. In addition, there seems to be a greater caloric contribution of fish in Ituqui's diet, probably due to the higher productivity of lakes and rivers in Ituqui varzea (low and flat land alongside a watercourse). Finally, Ituqui has shown greater dependency over purchased items, whereas Caxiuana has still a strong reliance on agricultural activities and on local social and economic exchange networks. Conclusion Besides confirming the importance of fish and manioc, results have also shown that industrialized products, such as sugar play an important role in local diets, and may point towards new tendencies in food consumption related to the current nutritional transition and to the erosion of local subsistence systems.

We examined seasonal pools in forests of northern Minnesota USA with the objective of quantifying the range of variation in plant communities within and among different geomorphic and forest settings. Abundances of plant functional groups were highly variable among pools, ranging from those having abundant upland trees, sedges, and perennial forbs to those having abundant wetland sedges, grasses, and forbs. Glacial landform and ecological landtype (local forest and soil type) explained little of this variation, while physical characteristics of the pools (primarily duration of flooding) explained 36% of the variation. Understanding landscape variation in seasonal pool plant communities is important for their conservation and management. If range of variation is understood, representative examples of all variants of pool systems can be identified for conservation, and management prescriptions can be tailored to different landscape settings.

J	Wolfer, SR; van Nes, EH; Straile, D				Wolfer, SR; van Nes, EH; Straile, D			Modelling the clonal growth of the rhizomatous macrophyte Potamogeton perfoliatus	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Macrophytes play a crucial role in the functioning of lake ecosystems. Until now most macrophyte models neglected the fact that the majority of macrophyte species expand clonally during the growing season. Inclusion of a detailed description of clonal growth in models can facilitate our understanding of space occupation and patch expansion and predict future macrophyte development. "CLOMO" is an individual-based model which includes a detailed, spatially explicit description of rhizome formation and clone expansion as well as a realistic description of photosynthesis including light limitation and temperature. The model also accounts for transfers of energy or resources between different parts of the clone ("clonal integration"). Although the clonal growth of macrophytes is complex and poorly known, the first model results for the macrophyte species Potamogeton perfoliatus were promising and compared well with the field data. The model can produce growth networks very similar to those found in the field. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis showed systematically which parameters have the largest effect on the architecture and expansion of the clones. The application of the model provided new insights into growth dynamics and patch development: (1) the model showed that a lack of branching will lead to the extinction of the clone after a certain number of years. This is due to the fact that the reproductive organs (turions) are formed at the end of a branch and even a small turion mortality will cause a reduction in surviving plant numbers; (2) the growth of rhizome axes relative to those in the previous year determines the patch density and patch expansion rate. Reversing rhizomes lead to compact patch growth whereas continuing rhizomes lead to loose aggregates. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Mistry, VV; Conway, D				Mistry, VV; Conway, D			Remote forcing of East African rainfall and relationships with fluctuations in levels of Lake Victoria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigates the climatological variables responsible for fluctuations in Lake Victoria levels, in particular the causal mechanism responsible for a major anomaly that occurred in 1961. A Lake Victoria rainfall series (LVRS) correlates significantly (5%) with Lake Victoria levels and is utilized for subsequent analysis of rainfall variability. Relationships between annual and seasonal (March-May and October-December (OND)) LVRS and a number of tropical and extra-tropical series were analyzed. The results illustrate the dominance of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in modulating LVRS. The greatest correlation is found between LVRSOND and the Southern Oscillation index (r = -0.39, significant at the 1% level), although the relationship is non-linear over the course of the century. Velocity potential chi is employed as the principal diagnostic variable. Seasonal composite maps and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of Indian Ocean region X-fields are utilized to test the hypothesis that an Indian Ocean Walker cell is responsible for the anomalous 1961 rainfall episode. Subsequent analysis leads to the rejection of this hypothesis. EOF analysis of OND 200 hPa chi-fields reveals a number of modes of tropical variability. EOF analysis of the Indian Ocean basin illustrates the emergence of a meridional circulation directed over the Indian Ocean (EOF5). This time series correlates significantly with LVRSOND (r = -0.40, 1% level), although the spatial pattern only explains a small proportion (2.35%) of the total variance. chi analysis for OND over the broader tropical region reveals significant relationships (5%) between OND EOF3* and July-September Sahel rainfall for the preceding season and subsequent year. This relationship may assist future long-lead seasonal forecast schemes for the Sahel region. Copyright (C) 2003 Royal Meteorological Society.

Tracking deepwater oxygen recovery using sedimentary chironomid assemblages: Peninsula Lake revisited	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Peninsula Lake, Ontario, Canada, is a Precambrian Shield lake that has experienced many environmental stressors since European settlement of the watershed in the mid-1800s, including forest clearance, water-level management, sewage inputs, and land-use changes. The deterioration of water quality by the 1970s prompted mitigation efforts intended to reduce inputs of nutrients and untreated sewage to the lake. Paleolimnological analysis of a sediment core from Peninsula Lake, collected in 1995, revealed that efforts to address eutrophication had been somewhat successful, in that the lake had returned to oligotrophic status by the early 1990s. Nevertheless, there had been little to no improvement in inferred deepwater oxygen conditions. We used similar paleolimnological techniques on a core collected in 2014 to examine ecological responses to environmental stressors and remediation efforts in the intervening years, with a particular focus on changes in the amount of oxygenated habitat available to lake trout. Specifically, we inferred trends in volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO), through analysis of sedimentary chironomid assemblages, to assess long-term changes in coldwater fisheries habitat. Potential drivers of VWHO were also investigated, and included diatom-inferred total phosphorus, spectrally derived trends in sedimentary chlorophyll a and its main diagenetic products, and lake-water dissolved organic carbon. The sedimentary chironomid assemblages indicate a long period of VWHO depletion, concurrent with known anthropogenic activities from the early twentieth century to the 1990s, followed by recent recovery to near pre-impact levels. The sedimentary diatom assemblages indicate nutrient enrichment throughout most of the twentieth century, which was also followed by a return to pre-impact conditions, albeit with recent indications of renewed nutrient enrichment. In contrast, strikingly different trajectories were observed in two other regional waterbodies that support lake trout, but experienced relatively little nutrient enrichment over the past similar to 150 years. Peninsula Lake appears to be recovering from nutrient enrichment and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, but water quality improvements have nevertheless been accompanied by increased primary production, perhaps because climate warming has extended the ice-free season and stratification period. Therefore, instead of returning to pre-impact conditions, Peninsula Lake appears to be developing a novel ecological state. Any future improvements in lake trout habitat that result from nutrient abatement may be offset by rising temperatures.					; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/B-8248-2014; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020	Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/0000-0002-8208-496X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2021	66	4					371	387		10.1007/s10933-021-00211-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00211-y		SEP 2021											WOS:000695093000001
J	Hursky, O; Pietrock, M				Hursky, Olesya; Pietrock, Michael			Chemical contaminants and parasites: Assessment of human health risks associated with consumption of whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) from two boreal lakes in northern Saskatchewan, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In Canada there is increasing concern about potential effects of industrial activities on wildlife and human health. In an interdisciplinary study concentrations of inorganic (metals, metalloids) and organic (PCBs, organochlorine pesticides) contaminants, and parasitic infections of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) from Montreal and Reindeer lakes, Saskatchewan, were investigated to assess human health risk related to fish consumption. In both lakes contamination of fish with chemical substances and compounds, respectively, were very low and often close to detection limits. Lake whitefish parasite communities consisted of 15 (Montreal Lake) and 12 (Reindeer Lake) species most of which were found in the intestinal tract. Many parasite species showed seasonal differences in prevalence and/or mean intensity of infection. None of the identified parasites are known to be human-pathogenic and overall, whitefish from both locations can be considered safe and healthy food. Nevertheless, women of child-bearing age and young children should limit their consumption to 3 and 2 meals, respectively, of Reindeer Lake whitefish per week to minimize potentially harmful exposure to mercury. As well, intestines of Montreal Lake fish should be removed prior to fish consumption if large parasite cysts containing a yet unidentified cestode species are detected. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AN "ENVIRO-INFORMATIC" ASSESSMENT OF SAGINAW BAY (LAKE HURON, USA) PHYTOPLANKTON: DATA-DRIVEN CHARACTERIZATION AND MODELING OF MICROCYSTIS (CYANOPHYTA)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Phytoplankton and Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutz.) Kutz. biovolumes were characterized and modeled, respectively, with regard to hydrological and meteorological variables during zebra mussel invasion in Saginaw Bay (1990-1996). Total phytoplankton and Microcystis biomass within the inner bay were one and one-half and six times greater, respectively, than those of the outer bay. Following mussel invasion, mean total biomass in the inner bay decreased 84% but then returned to its approximate initial value. Microcystis was not present in the bay during 1990 and 1991 and thereafter occurred at/in 52% of sample sites/dates with the greatest biomass occurring in 1994-1996 and within months having water temperatures >19 degrees C. With an overall relative biomass of 0.03 +/- 0.01 (mean + SE), Microcystis had, at best, a marginal impact upon holistic compositional dynamics. Dynamics of the centric diatom Cyclotella ocellata Pant. and large pennate diatoms dominated compositional dissimilarities both inter-and intra-annually. The environmental variables that corresponded with phytoplankton distributions were similar for the inner and outer bays, and together identified physical forcing and biotic utilization of nutrients as determinants of system-level biomass patterns. Nonparametric models explained 70%-85% of the variability in Microcystis biovolumes and identified maximal biomass to occur at total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranging from 40 to 45 mu g . L-1.

J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, Kenneth H.			Detection of regime shifts in multi-species communities: the Bay of Quinte phytoplankton example	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Human activities have led to ecological regime shifts, first revealed at the community level in ecosystems. A regime shift in a biological community is a sudden change in the relative contributions of several taxa, resulting in a post-shift state that remains stable over the long term with a structure that is outside the boundaries of the 'normal' pre-shift variability. Most methods for regime shift detection are based on univariate statistics (e. g. commercial fish catch data, sea surface temperature anomalies). Multivariate methods suitable for identifying change in multi-species communities can be used to identify regime shifts in communities. 2. In this paper, I use a 37-year record (1972-2008) of phytoplankton in the Bay of Quinte (northeastern Lake Ontario) to demonstrate the use of several largely independent data analysis methods that are shown here to concur in their output. Among the most powerful procedures is an approach that models the anomalies around long-term Grand Mean and reference-point community structures that were compared to annual structures using Bray-Curtis community similarity coefficients. CUSUM plots of model residuals, segmented regression analysis and other tests are all useful to identify the location of break-points in records of anomalies. Follow-up significance testing was performed separately with permutation tests. Improved sensitivity of these techniques when applied to highly seasonal data was demonstrated after extraction of seasonal components as periodic functions. 3. Statistically significant shifts in the Bay of Quinte phytoplankton were detected in the year following an approximate 50% reduction in point-source phosphorus loading in early 1978 and again immediately after the establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990s. Associated with this second intervention was an increased representation by species of the potentially toxic Cyano-prokaryote Microcystis, and dramatic declines in some diatom species, with significant implications for human use and food web function. 4. This paper provides a 'tool box' of methods (most freely available on the WWW) for those needing to distinguish between true shifts and normal inter-annual variability in biological communities. Ability to measure statistically significant change in communities can lead to enhanced understanding of cause-effect relations and to enhanced capabilities for prediction of change.																			2041-210X	2041-2096				AUG	2011	2	4					416	426		10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00093.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00093.x													WOS:000293351700010

It is one of the most important sources of drinking water with a surface area of 23.1 km(2) and a volume of 220 x 10(6) m(3) in the Marmara Region. Water quality characteristics of the lake investigated from May 2002 to April 2003 enabled us to identify the effect of waste loads on water quality of Omerli Lake. The following parameters were measured in the lake water: temperature (16.1A degrees C), conductivity (250 mu S/cm), secchi disk depth (1.9 m), dissolved oxygen (DO) (9.36 mg/L), nutrients [ortho-phosphate (78.9 mu g/L), nitrate + nitrite (707.5 mu g/L) and ammonia-nitrogen (264 mu g/L)], chlorophyll a (9.43 mu g/L), total organic carbon (3.33 mg/L), total suspended solids (4.54 mg/L), total poly aromatic hydrocarbon (t-PAH) (0.69 mu g/L) and copper (24.5 mu g/L). T-PAH (16.5 mg/g-dry-w), Cu (96.5 mu g/g-dry-w), organic carbon (org-C) (2.0%) and N (0.44%) were determined in the surface sediment. The values of chlorophyll a and DO in the upper layer were relatively high and low secchi disk depths indicates eutrophic state. There are five channels discharging water, including waste water, into the lake. All channels were sampled during six occasions in order to cover variations between seasons. The following parameters were measured: total organic carbon, total phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia and total suspended solids with the flow rates. The GoA beyli stream has the highest flow into the lake (1.5 x 10(8) m(3)/year) but most of the nutrients were discharged from the Pa angstrom akoy channel. It is accounting for 81% of ammonia and 80% of total phosphorus into the lake. Three scenarios were run using AQUATOX model: (1) all existing inflows are discharging into the lake (present situation); (2) none is discharging; (3) all are discharging except the Pa angstrom akoy channel. The first scenario produced concentrations consistent with measurements in the lake. In all stations, a phytoplankton peak value was predicted during November and December 2002, and January 2003. In the second scenario, as expected, a significant decrease in the concentrations was predicted. In the third scenario, a small improvement in the water quality was obtained. To significantly improve the state of the lake, instead of entering Pa angstrom akoy channel, wastewater should bypass the lake.

Habitat Use of American Alligators in East Texas	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) has made a remarkable recovery throughout its range during the last half-century. In Texas, USA, current inland alligator population and harvest management strategies rely on generalized and often site-specific habitat and population data generated from coastal populations, because it is assumed that habitat and demographic similarities exist between inland and coastal populations. These assumptions have not been verified, however, and no studies have specifically examined inland alligator habitat use in Texas. We quantified alligator habitat use in East Texas during 2003-2004 to address this information gap and to facilitate development of regionally specific management strategies. Although habitat was variable among study areas, alligators used habitats with >50% open water, substantial floating vegetation, and emergent vegetation close (< 12 m) to dry ground and cover. Adults used habitats further from dry ground and cover, in open water (75-85%), with less floating vegetation (6-22%) than did subadults, which used habitats that were closer to dry ground and cover, with less open water (52-68%), and more floating vegetation (8-40%). Although habitat use mirrored coastal patterns, we estimated alligator densities to be 3-5 times lower than reported in coastal Texas, likely a result of inland habitat deviations from optimal coastal alligator habitat, particularly in the preponderance of open water and floating vegetation. Our findings that 1) inland habitats varied among sites and did not exactly match assumed optimal coastal habitats, 2) alligators used these inland habitats slightly differently than coastal areas, and 3) inland alligator densities were lower than coastal populations, all highlight the need for regionally specific management approaches. Because alligator populations are influenced by habitat quality and availability, any deviations from assumed optimal habitat may magnify harvest impacts upon inland populations.

Variations in the relative biovolumes of dominant cyanobacterial taxa were evaluated in the context of environmental conditions using canonical correlation analysis (CCorrA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The objective was to test a conceptual model in which underwater irradiance determines dominance by bloom-forming (high light adapted) or non-blooming (low light adapted) taxa. 2. The data set consisted of 404 contiguous observations, collected over a 3-year period at eight pelagic sites, in shallow Lake Okeechobee, Florida, U.S.A. Data included species biovolumes, total phosphorus (TP) total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll a concentrations, as well as two indices: underwater irradiance (Secchi depth) and the ratio of Secchi:total depth. 3. The first environmental canonical variable was strongly correlated with the two light-related indices, and negatively correlated with TP. This reflects the predominant role of resuspended P-rich lake sediments in controlling underwater irradiance in the shallow lake. The first species canonical variable displayed a strong negative correlation with Lyngbya limnetica and L. contorta, and positive correlations with Anabaena circinalis, Aphanizomenon flos aquae and Microcystis spp. The results support the conceptual model; the first pair of canonical variables explained 55% of the variation in the species-environmental data set. RDA results provided further support for the hypothesis that irradiance was the major force controlling community structure. 4. One unexpected result was a positive association between Oscillatoria spp. dominance and indicators of high irradiance. This conflicts with past research indicating that Oscillatoria is a low light adapted taxon, and the finding that it is the most abundant taxon in Lake Okeechobee. This may reflect the fact that the two Lyngbya taxa were more strongly associated with low light conditions than Oscillatoria. CCorrA results indicated that Oscillatoria densities are strongly controlled by water temperature. There is a need for more detailed studies of cyanobacteria ecophysiology in order to explain fully the seasonality of phytoplankton in this and other shallow subtropical lakes.																			0046-5070					MAY	1998	39	3					547	556		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00308.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00308.x													WOS:000073798300014
J	Burns, CW				Burns, CW			Crowding-induced changes in growth, reproduction and morphology of Daphnia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Daphnia may reach high population densities seasonally, or in patches, in lakes. To test the effects of chemicals released by high daphniid densities on their life-history traits, nine species of Daphnia, D. magna, D. pulicaria, D. pulex, D. hyalina, D. galeata, D. laevis, D. lumholtzi, D. ambigua and D. cucullata, were grown in water from crowded Daphnia cultures in a flow-through system in the presence of abundant food. 2. Water from Daphnia at greater than or equal to 85 L-1 depressed growth rate, and lowered body size and clutch at first reproduction of six species of small-bodied Daphnia (adult body length < 1.8 mm), but had no significant effects on larger species. Two clones of D. pulex differed in their growth rate in response to crowding, indicating that response patterns may vary within species. 3. Chemicals released by crowded D. magna reduced tail spine length in D. lumholtzi and D. cucullata by 37% and 11%, respectively, and induced changes in carapace morphology in D, lumholtzi and D, ambigua. 4. Chemicals released by crowded conspecifics may provide an additional, density-dependent mechanism of population regulation; when large species of Daphnia coexist at a high population density with small species, these chemicals may reinforce the competitive advantage of large species.																			0046-5070					JAN	2000	43	1					19	29		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00510.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00510.x													WOS:000085242000002

The study was conducted between November 1999 and May 2000, which included the dryand wet seasons. It is an old, man-made impounded water reservoir. The methodology included the collection of phytoplankton samples from the surface to the bottom in a fixed station to include four vertical profiles and to analyse them for physico-chemical and algological characteristics. Ecological indices, such as Shannon-Weaver for species diversity, Margalef's species richness and Pielou's evenness were calculated. The results reveal the characteristics of the eutrophic to the hyper trophic state for the Gargalheiras reservoir with the dominance of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Raphidiopsis curvata, Microcystis aeroginosa and Oscillatoria sp during the dry period. Cages were suspended to culture Amazonian fish, Tambaqui, at the beginning of the wet period close to the sampling stations in the reservoir and treated for point source nutrient loading and disturbance factor. This localised disturbance stimulated the growth of Chlorophyceae species, which co-existed along with the species of cyanobacteria to finally dominate; coinciding with the stability of monsoon rain in May. The conclusion drawn from the study period revealed that the reservoir with high inorganic nutrients had reduced transparency, anoxic hypolimnion, elevated levels of electrical conductivity and the dominance of cyanobacteria during the dry period and the dominance of chlorophyceae in the wet period.

Rapid changes in tree composition and biodiversity: consequences of dams on dry seasonal forests	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Background: Plants in a seasonal environment that become close to the artificial lake after dams construction may have enhanced growth or die due to the new conditions. Changes in mortality or growth rates lead to changes in community diversity, and we do not know if the community functions will change; our main hypothesis was that a few years after impoundment, species richness and diversity will increase because the increased supply of water would favor the establishment of water-associated species. Therefore, we evaluated the consequences of proximity of three dry seasonal forests to the water table after damming, with a dynamic evaluation of the species studied to understand changes in diversity in these areas. We sampled 60 plots of 20x10 m in each forest and measured all trees with a diameter equal to or greater than 4.77 cm before damming and 2 and 4 years after damming. We calculated dynamic rates and compared species changes during these periods. We also compared diversity and richness using Shannon index and rarefaction curves. Results: Many species had high dynamic rates and many trees of specialists of dry forests died; conversely, others had high growth rates. Some typical species of riparian forests were found only after damming, also enhancing forest richness in deciduous forests. In general, the deciduous forest communities seemed to change to a typical riparian forest, but many seasonal specialist species still had high recruitment and growth rate, maintaining the seasonal traits, such as dispersion by wind and deciduousness in the forests, where an entire transformation did not occur. Conclusions: We conclude that even with the increment in basal area and recruitment of many new species, the impacts of damming and consequent changes will never lead to the same functions as in a riparian forest.

J	Bowers, R; De Szalay, FA				Bowers, R; De Szalay, FA			Effects of hydrology on unionids (Unionidae) and zebra mussels (Dreissenidae) in a Lake Erie coastal wetland	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Infestation by introduced zebra mussels has extirpated native unionids in many Great Lake habitats. Shallow areas in coastal wetlands are intermittently dewatered by seiches and seasonal water level changes, and we examined how water level fluctuations and sediment characteristics affected interactions among unionids and zebra mussels in a Lake Erie coastal marsh. In 2001 we sampled unionid distributions and measured zebra mussel colonization on PVC plates at I cm, 18 cm and >35 cm water depths. We found a diverse unionid community (15 species) with many juvenile unionids. Unionid densities (0.01 unionids/m(2)) were comparable to other coastal wetlands, but are lower than reported in offshore areas before zebra mussels were introduced. Zebra mussels colonized plates at >3000 individuals/m(2) in some locations. Although >60% of unionids had byssal threads on their shells, >75% of unionids had no attached zebra mussels. Therefore, zebra mussels are colonizing unionids, but are not surviving. Unionid numbers and zebra mussel colonization were low in shallow (1-35 cm) water depths, indicating that water level fluctuations limited their distributions. Only two species of unionids were collected in 1-17 cm deep areas, and areas that became mudflats in September had almost no unionids. Numbers of zebra mussels and unionids were not correlated with organic content or silt/clay content of the sediments. Habitat characteristics shared by this wetland and other coastal wetlands that are important refuges of unionids include: a hydrological connection with the lake, areas deep enough for unionids to survive low water levels and soft sediments that allow unionid burrowing.

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The only remaining species flock of endemic, large cyprinid fishes is found in Lake Tana, Ethiopia. A monthly experimental trawl program was conducted in 1991-1993 and 1999-2001, sampling 12 stations distributed over three habitats differing in depth and distance to shore. The aim was to compare the total abundance, spatial distribution and proportion of juveniles of the most common Barbus species in the Bahar Dar Gulf between both periods. We found a sharp reduction (75%) in total abundance, both in number and biomass of the Barbus species and even more (90%) in the number of juveniles between the two periods. However, the spatial distribution of the different Barbus species over the three habitats had not changed. High natural variability in fish stocks might be expected in environmentally unstable lakes. Although strongly pulsed (seasonal), Lake Tana is a relatively stable system. No major differences were found in abiotic parameters in 1990s that could have caused the dramatic changes in abundance. The most likely explanation is the negative impact of the motorised, commercial gillnet fishery targeting the spawning aggregations of these barbs. The drastic decline in juveniles points especially towards serious recruitment over-fishing. The results stress the need for the immediate development of a sound management plan focussing on fishing effort restrictions during the Bat-bus breeding season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment samples were collected in rivers and harbors around the lake and its catchment area. A modified four-step sequential leaching procedure was applied for determination of the distribution of elements. The fractions were: (1) exchangeable/bound to carbonate; (2) bound to Fe/Mn oxide; (3) bound to organic matter/sulfides; and (4) acid-soluble residue. Samples were taken in three seasons and the average concentration of the elements was calculated. Concentrations of elements were mostly well below the Hungarian standards set for soils and geochemical background values. Most of the elements were found in the acid-soluble residue and bound to organic matter/sulfide fractions, characterizing stable compounds in sediments. There was a difference on the elemental composition of sediments collected at rivers in the catchment area and harbors with relatively small boat traffic. Depending upon the nature of element and local pollution sources the concentration of Pb and Cu ions was found higher in sediments taken at harbors than that of small rivers. Generally, it can be stated that elemental concentration of sediments inside of the lake is smaller than at the catchment area, so the pollution from emission sources has not reached the lake yet.

J	Das, R; Krishnakumar, A				Das, Revathy; Krishnakumar, Appukuttan			Implications of Methane Emissions in Biogeochemical Budgeting: A Study from a Tropical Wetland System, Kerala, India	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Studies on the flux measurements of methane (CH4) from wetlands of tropics are very meagre. Such data from this region would be valuable for generating the emission patterns at local/regional scale and would contribute to the global database. Investigations was done on measuring the daytime pattern of methane emissions during premonsoon, monsoon, and postmonsoon seasons from a tropical wetland system, namely the Vellayani lake located in the urbanized area of Thiruvananthapuram city in Southern India. The difference in the methane flux from the vegetated littoral zone and nonvegetated limnetic zone and the edaphic features controlling the production and emission of methane were also proposed to be studied. Methane emissions were measured using static chamber, and analyses were performed using gas chromatograph. The methane emissions recorded in monsoon season from vegetated littoral zone was significantly higher compared with pre- and postmonsoon seasons, indicating seasonal fluctuations in methane emission from the wetland system. CH4 efflux in the zone of emergent vegetation in the littoral zone was significantly higher than from the nonvegetated limnetic zone indicating the importance of vegetation in methane transport to the atmosphere. Positive correlation of CH4 efflux with edaphic factors like total organic carbon and total nitrogen showed that these factors largely determined the production and emission of methane. These results underlined the fact that the vegetated littoral zones of lake, especially the emergent plant zones were supersaturated with CH4 compared with nonvegetated zones, by facilitating the production of carbon for CH4 emission, and also enabled the release of CH4 by diffusion through the intercellular gas lacunas. The study arrives at the conclusion that the atmospheric CH4 emissions will be tilted by the growth of exotic species and may be the reason for enhancing the climate warming in local/regional environment and may be even important globally.

Here, we aimed at understanding the origin of organic matter stored in the sediment compartment and the related diversity of sediment microbial communities in a lake with deoxygenated deep water layers. We used a geostatistical approach to map and compare both the variation of organic matter and microbial communities in sediment. Spatialisation of C/N ratio and delta 13C signature of sediment organic matter suggested that Lake Remoray was characterized by an algal overproduction which could be related to an excess of nutrient due to the close lake-watershed connectivity. Three spatial patterns were observed for sediment microbial communities after the hypoxic event, each characterized by specific genetic structure, microbial diversity and composition. The relative abundance variation of dominant microbial groups across Lake Remoray such as Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi provided us important information on the lake areas where hypoxia occurs.

However, species respond differently to this cycle, and therefore, lakes can function as natural laboratories to test hypotheses about the interactions between the mechanisms involved in this dynamic. Here, we evaluate whether and how the level of the Parana River affects the structure of fish assemblages in the littoral region of lakes (with and without permanent connection to the Parana River), using taxonomic richness and species similarity data from a time series of 14years. Our main working hypothesis was that the ecological descriptors (species richness, abundance, and spatial vs. temporal distribution) of fish assemblages, among lakes with different degrees of connection to the main river of the floodplain, may respond differently to the variation in the hydrological level. The results showed a significant difference in the composition of fish assemblages among the studied lakes, but the trends depended on the year considered (2002, 2006, 2012, and 2013). Therefore, despite of the artificial regulation promoted by dams upstream, the hydrological cycle still is the main driver of beta-diversity in littoral fish assemblages from shallow lakes in this floodplain. In addition, the variability of the composition of these assemblages is also straightly dependent on the features of the floods. Our results highlight the importance of seasonal variability in the hydrological level of this river for non-stochastic assembly rules of fish communities across spatial and temporal scales.					; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Cruz, Priscilla/AAC-4755-2020	Ramos Cruz, Priscilla/0000-0001-9181-1826; Message, Hugo/0000-0002-6031-8577; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2018	101	12					1723	1738		10.1007/s10641-018-0824-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0824-1													WOS:000449887400009

The objective was to analyze richness and diversity patterns of aquatic insect assemblages in the Usumacinta Basin in Mexico. Entomological collections and literature were revised for reported taxa for the Usumacinta watershed. Sampling was conducted in streams, rivers, and floodplain lakes in Centla, Tenosique-Palizada and Lacantim-Yaxchilan. The number of families was increased from 45 to 70 and the number of genera from 109 to 192. The Lacantnn-Yaxchilan area showed the highest richness, with 70 genera, followed by Centla with 69 and Tenosique-Palizada with 62. Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera were very abundant and diverse in the lotic habitats of Lacantim-Yaxchilan, while Diptera, Hemiptera and Odonata dominated in the lentic habitats of Centla and Tenosique-Palizada. Abundance was lower during the rainy season in the three study areas. The highest diversity was associated to streams and rivers in Lacantan-Yaxchilan and a floodplain lake in Centla with abundant aquatic macrophytes, suggesting that habitats with greater diversity can occur at different points along the basin, including the lotic environments of the tributaries and in lakes of the Usumacinta floodplain.																			1870-3453	2007-8706				DEC	2018	89			S			45	64		10.22201/ib.20078706e.2018.4.2177	http://dx.doi.org/10.22201/ib.20078706e.2018.4.2177													WOS:000455160800003

PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS WITH SEASONAL WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS												Water level in rivers, lakes and reservoirs has great influence on the interactions between prey and predator fish. Indeed, the increase of the water volume hinders the capture of the prey by the predator. The same reasoning applies when there is a decrease in the volume of water, favoring the capture of the prey by the predator. In this paper, we consider a seasonally varying predator-prey model to study the influence of water-level variations on the interaction between two species of fishes in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water-level is introduced in the predation rate taking into account two values, leading to a general switched system. Permanence, stability and existence of an invariant domain containing at least one periodic solution are established. Our theoretical results confirm the assumption that the water exerts a strong influence on the interaction between fishes.

The objectives of this work were to provide information about the vegetational changes that occurred at the Banana' Island, in order to contribute to the understanding the dynamics of past and current savanna and areas of ecotones with forests. Thus, a sedimentary core collected from a small lake at the Bananal Island plain was submitted to pollen and radiocarbon dating analyses. The results showed that the last millennium was dominated by forest reflecting a wet climate. At the beginning of the record (920-770 yr cal BP) the wet climate and high rainfall produced flooding during long rainy seasons that maintained the Javaes River connected to the studied lake, and hence, this environment was marked by the presence of a homogenous forest rich in Moraceae/Urticaceae, due to flooded soils occurrence. During the following period (770-304 yr cal BP) the reduced rainfall and shortening of the rainy seasons isolated the lake from the Javaes River for long periods, which caused a diversification of the forest and gave rise to the appearance of the components of floodplain forest and marsh vegetation adapted to waterlogged soils. Since 304 years cal BP to the present day this environment remained dominated by this diverse forest and the lacustrine conditions were also similar to previous phase, with a slight increase of moisture in the last 84 years that caused the increase of Piranhea.					oliveira, etiene f p/E-8981-2013	fabbrin pires oliveira, etiene/0000-0002-6062-8014													0044-5967	1809-4392				JUN	2015	45	2					215	229		10.1590/1809-4392201402265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1809-4392201402265													WOS:000351658300010

We examined cormorant diet and fish consumption at the colony from 1992 to 2013. During this time period, two events, management actions and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invasion, occurred that affected the number of fish consumed by cormorants and their diet composition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of round goby on the feeding ecology of cormorants and evaluate the efficacy of management actions on meeting cormorant population targets at the colony. Round goby first appeared in the diet in 2004 (0.8%) and within one year were the primary prey (293%). The presence of round goby in the diet of cormorants: (1) eliminated seasonal variability in diet composition, (2) reversed seasonal trends in the number of fish consumed daily, (3) increased daily fish consumption, and (4) significantly reduced the consumption of other species including yellow perch and smallmouth bass. Management actions, such as egg oiling and culling, were also effective in reducing nesting activity and the number of cormorant feeding days at the Little Galloo Island colony. There is evidence that the combination of management actions and round goby may have allowed some population recovery of yellow perch and smallmouth bass in eastern Lake Ontario.

J	Huber, V; Gaedke, U				Huber, Veronika; Gaedke, Ursula			The role of predation for seasonal variability patterns among phytoplankton and ciliates	OIKOS												Investigating the mechanisms which underlie the biomass fluctuations of populations and communities is important to better understand the processes which buffer community biomass in a variable environment. Based on long-term data of plankton biomass in Lake Constance (Bodensee), this study aims at explaining the different degree of synchrony among populations observed within two freshwater plankton groups, phytoplankton and ciliates. Established measures of temporal variability such as the variance ratio and cross-correlation coefficients were combined with first-order autoregressive models that allow estimating species interactions from time-series data. We found that predation was an important driver of the observed seasonal variability patterns in phytoplankton and ciliates, and that competitive interactions only played a subordinate role. In Lake Constance copepods and cladocerans, two major invertebrate predator groups, focus their grazing pressure at different times of the season. Model results suggested that compensatory dynamics detected in phytoplankton originate from the differential vulnerability of species to either one of these two predator groups. For ciliates model results advocated that synchrony among species occurs because ciliates tend to be vulnerable to both predator groups. Our findings underline the necessity of extending studies of community variability to multiple trophic levels because accounting for predator-prey interactions may often be more important than accounting for competitive interactions at one trophic level.

We present results of the analysis of mammal seasonal and daily activity patterns, registered by camera traps in two colonies of the great cormorants in Lithuania. Red foxes and raccoon dogs mainly visited colonies in the cormorant breeding time, April to July. In the inland colony of great cormorants in Lukstas Lake, average red fox relative shooting frequency in cormorant breeding time considerably exceeded that in non-breeding time (on average, 41.8 and 5.9 photos/100 days respectively). In the peninsular colony of great cormorants in Juodkrante average relative shooting frequency of red fox in the breeding time was 7.8 versus 3.4 photos/100 days in non-breeding time, relative shooting frequencies of raccoon dog were 50.0 versus 1.3 photos/100 days, respectively. Daily activity patterns of wild boar and red fox in both colonies, as well as activity patterns of raccoon dog in Lukstas were related to the activity of cormorants with various degree of significance.

This study aims to elucidate the impact of the wind on the spatio-temporal variation of TSS in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, during low-water (March and June, <1 m) and high-water (September and December, 8-10 m) seasons. To this end, wind and TSS data for December 2016 and March, June, and September 2017 were collected and analyzed. For spatial interpolation of wind speed, the inverse distance weighted method was found to be better (R-2 = 0.49) than the vectorized average (R-2 = 0.30) and inverse of the ratio of distance (R-2 = 0.31). Spatial interpolation showed that the wind speed and direction on the lake were <5 m/s and southward during the low-water season and <7 m/s and westward during the high-water season. The TSS concentration in the low-water season was higher (>50 mg/L) than that in the high-water season. The TSS concentration during the low-water season was empirically described by wind speed (W), water depth (D), and shear stress (tau_wave) with a function of W-3, W-3/D, and exp((W/D)) or exp((tau_wave)), depending on the location in the lake. The critical shear stress due to wind-induced waves at most of the places in the lake was higher than the total shear stress indicated. Sedimentation was predominant in December and June, and erosion (siltation) was dominant in March. Most of the siltation in March was dominant in the southern part of the lake.

J	Risacher, F; Fritz, B; Alonso, H				Risacher, F; Fritz, B; Alonso, H			Non-conservative behavior of bromide in surface waters and brines of Central Andes: A release into the atmosphere?	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The transfer of reactive bromine into the atmosphere was recently observed by Honninger et al. [Honninger, G., Bobrowski, N., Palenque, E.R., Torrez, R., Platt, U., 2004. Reactive bromine and sulfur emission at salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, doi:10.1029/2003GL018818] in a large salt pan of the Bolivian Altiplano: the salar de Uyuni. However, bromide is considered to be an excellent conservative tracer, which leads to the questioning of its actual conservation in surficial geochemical processes. The relation between bromide and lithium, thought to be a conservative component in waters and brines of the Central Andes, points to a depletion of Br relative to Li in Uyuni brines of about 50-300 kg/day, a flux close to that measured by Honninger et al. (2004): >= 200 kg/day. Such values are very low in regard to the size of the salar (5-30 g/km(2)/day). Salt efflorescences have a much higher surface area than a flat salt crust, which should enhance the release of bromine. Leach solutions of salt efflorescences in closed basins of northern Chile are compared to their parent waters. Conservative components should have the same concentration ratios in both solutions. Actually, a strong depletion in Br is observed in the leach solutions, which could suggest a significant release of Br from the salt into the atmosphere. During the rainy season, efflorescences are leached and their dissolved components brought in saline lakes and salars. Evaporative profiles show a slight but noticeable fractionation between Li and Br which could be due to the contribution of Br-depleted leach solutions of salt efflorescences. Therefore, bromide does not behave conservatively in surface waters and brines of the Central Andes. If the loss of Br is really due to its transfer into the atmosphere, then the flux would be much higher than that estimated for the salar de Uyuni alone. Numerous salt pans, saline lakes, and widespread efflorescences covering large land surfaces would contribute significantly more reactive bromine into the atmosphere. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Sediment samples, carrying microorganisms (eubacteria) and macroinvertebrates, were seasonally collected from similar habitats in streams with different levels of pollution. Microbial community taxa. and densities were determined using polymerase chain reaction- denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 16S rDNA sequence analysis techniques. The identity and density of macroinvertebrates were concurrently determined. In general, differences were observed on grouping by self-organizing map (SOM) in polluted, clean and recovering sites based on the microbial densities, while the community patterns were partly dependent on the sampling period. A Spearman rank order correlation analysis revealed correlations of several eubacterial species with those of macroinvertebrates: a negative correlation was observed between Acidovorax sp. (from polluted sites) and Gammaridae (mostly from the clean site), while Herbaspirillum sp. and janhinobacterium sp. appeared to have positive correlations with some macroinvertebrate species. The population dynamics of the tolerant texa, Tubificidae and Chironomidae, appeared to be related with changes in the densities of Acidovorax sp. This study revealed community relationships between macroinvertebrates and microorganisms, reflecting the connectivity between the two communities via the food chain. A further physio-ecological and symbiological study on the invertebrate-microorganism relationships will be required to understand the degradation and utilization of detritus in aquatic ecosystems as well as to elucidate the roles of the intertaxa in the recovery of polluted aquatic environments.

There have been harmful effects due to water resource management of the world natural heritage site at Lake Ichkeul, Tunisia. These concerns have increased the interest in the production of natural minerals. Natural minerals, such as calcite, are produced from in situ microorganisms and are categorized as construction materials. They are considered to be a viable alternative new resource. This study focused on the physical and biological properties of sediments from Ichkeul Lake and the potential of calcite precipitation from in situ microorganisms in these sediments. The results of field investigations focused on high-salinity aquatic plants (Ruppia cirrhosa) that were distributed in the eastern portion of the lake. These results show that the area around the Tinja channel had increased salinity in the dry season. The element contents were measured with portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Ichkeul Lake sediments had higher calcium content than standard Japanese samples. This suggests that microbial carbonate precipitation is applicable to Ichkeul Lake. Calcite precipitation techniques, such as acceleration of urease-producing bacteria, were studied. Pre-cultivation tests focused on increasing urease activity rates from in situ bacteria. Solidification of sediment resulting from enhanced calcite precipitation rates through use of urease-producing bacteria was examined. All of the sediment samples from Ichkeul Lake were able to precipitate calcite. The results of the field investigation and laboratory tests indicated that the area around the mouth of the Joumine River showed an enhanced calcite precipitation rate after a cultivation period of 1 month under high-salinity conditions.

The relationship between phytoplankton and fish in nutrient-rich shallow Lake Qarun, Egypt	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The present study focused on the determination of the baseline data and correlations between biological and physicochemical variables, including the assessment of trophic conditions in Lake Qarun. The concentrations of nutrients were high, with the maxima usually in the east subarea (total nitrogen 6.40 mg dm(-3), mineral nitrogen 2.34 mg dm(-3), orthophosphates 0.22 mg dm(-3)). A total of 134 phytoplankton species were recorded. Bacillariophyceae and Dinophyceae co-dominated spatially and seasonally in phytoplankton assemblages. The highest phytoplankton density (935 x 104 cells dm(-3)) and chlorophyll a content (69.3 mu g dm(-3)) were recorded in the east subarea of the lake, whereas the largest total and dominant fish (Mugil cephalus and Solea spp.) were in the west. Tilapia zillii and Engraulis encrasicolus were most abundant in the east and in the middle part, respectively. When phytoplankton density decreased from the east toward the west subarea, the Secchi disk depth increased. The TLI-based assessment indicated hypereutrophic waters at most sites of Lake Qarun. Statistically significant positive or negative correlations were found between the dominant fish species: T. zillii and Solea spp., and the phytoplankton density, Dinophyceae density, concentrations of TP, chlorophyll a, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate. Such correlations may be helpful to better understand how to enhance the sustainable fish production.					; Hussian, Abd Ellatif/ABB-4335-2020; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018	Hussian, Abdellatif/0000-0002-9633-8465; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290													1730-413X	1897-3191				DEC	2016	45	4					539	553		10.1515/ohs-2016-0045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2016-0045													WOS:000390561200008

We also compared basic environmental variables to test for hurricane-related changes. Significant post-hurricane changes in fish assemblages occurred in trawl (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R < 0.090, p < 0.05) and beach seine (ANOSIM, R < 0.120, p < 0.05) collections across all seasons. Gillnet assemblages exhibited changes in only one season (ANOSIM, R = 0.045, p < 0.05). These consistently low global R values (all R < 0.120) across all gears suggest only minor compositional changes in species. When peak abundance periods were compared for individual species, Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) declined in trawl collections after the hurricanes (Friedman's test, chi (2) = 6.00, p = 0.014) but increased in gillnet collections (Friedman's test, chi (2) = 5.00, p = 0.025). Hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis) increased in trawl collections, but Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli), naked gobies (Gobiosoma bosc), and rough silverside (Membras martinica) all declined in beach seine samples and Atlantic croakers (Micropogonias undulatus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), and sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius) all declined in gillnet samples. In general, salinity increased and water clarity and dissolved oxygen decreased after the hurricanes. While the overall composition of Lake Pontchartrain fish assemblages remains stable, the significant decline of some species and changes in certain environmental variables are cause for concern. Future monitoring should determine if all elements of this estuary will recover from these impacts.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2014	37	2					461	475		10.1007/s12237-013-9675-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9675-3													WOS:000334170400016
J	Rattas, M; Lomp, P; Joeleht, A				Rattas, Maris; Lomp, Pille; Joeleht, Argo			Carbonate cementation in the late glacial outwash and beach deposits in northern Estonia	ESTONIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The sedimentary environments, morphology and formation of carbonate cement in the late glacial glaciofluvial outwash and beach deposits in northern Estonia are discussed. Cementation is observed in well-drained, highly porous carbonaceous debris-rich gravel and sand-forming, resistant ledges in otherwise unconsolidated sediments. The cemented units occur as laterally continuous layers or as isolated lenticular patches with thicknesses from a few centimetres to 3 m. The cement is found in two main morphologies: (1) cement crusts or coatings around detrital grains and (2) massive cement almost entirely filling interparticle pores and intraparticle voids. It is exclusively composed of low-Mg calcite with angular equant to slightly elongated rhombohedral and scalenohedral or prismatic crystals, which indicate precipitation from meteoric or connate fresh surface (glacial lake) water and/or near-surface groundwater under low to moderate supersaturation and flow conditions. The absence of organic structures within the cement suggests that cementation is essentially inorganic. The cement exhibits both meteoric vadose and phreatic features and most probably occurred close to the vadose-phreatic interface, where the conditions were transitional and/or fluctuating. Cementation has mainly taken place by CO2-degassing in response to fluctuations in groundwater level and flow conditions, controlled by the Baltic Ice Lake water level, and seasonal cold and/or dry climate conditions.

It is shown that the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and structure is characterized by long-term variations caused by anthropogenic and natural climatic impacts. The regularities in restructuring of different phytoplankton communities under anthropogenic impact are much in common.

J	Park, GS; Marshall, HG				Park, GS; Marshall, HG			Estuarine relationships between zooplankton community structure and trophic gradients	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Zooplankton and water quality parameters were investigated at eight mesohaline stations in the lower Chesapeake Bay and Elizabeth River from January through December 1994 to identify the changes of zooplankton community structure with increased eutrophication. The total micro- and mesozooplankton biomass decreased with the increase of eutrophication. However, the relative proportion of microzooplankton increased with increased eutrophication. Within highly eutrophied waters, the small oligotrichs (<30 mu m) and rotifers dominated the total zooplankton biomass (as carbon). However, tintinnids, copepod nauplii and mesozooplankton significantly decreased with the increase of eutrophication. These patterns were consistent throughout the seasons and had significant relationships statistically. These results suggest zooplankton community structures characterize an increasing eutrophication of an ecosystem.																			0142-7873					JAN	2000	22	1					121	135		10.1093/plankt/22.1.121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.1.121													WOS:000084903900009

The mirid's host-plant relationships have remained unknown. From 2002 to 2008, 1 collected 359 adults and 78 nymphs (instars II-V) on Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides Michx.; Ericaceae), a dioecious evergreen shrub endemic to the southeastern United States. Nymphs and all but four adults were on male plants with flower buds or flowers in October, November, or December; the mirid was not found during sampling in January, February, March, April, June, or August. Keltonia balli was found only in the Lake Wales Ridge and other sand scrubs of peninsular Florida from Clay County south to Highlands County. The plant bug is a rosemary specialist whose nymphs develop on reproductive structures of male plants. Aspects of this herbivore-plant system needing elucidation, such as the number of generations of K. balli and factors that might synchronize its seasonality with a transient resource, are discussed.																			0013-8797					OCT	2009	111	4					880	889		10.4289/0013-8797-111.4.880	http://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797-111.4.880													WOS:000271453600009

Considerations of lake-river interaction, supported by statistical measures of 47 bottom samples, suggest that sediment transport and deposition within the lake is controlled by two types of human constructed structures in addition to natural factors: (1) the dykes constructed in the front of streams, which feed the lake by strong flows, to prevent the filling of lakebed by coarse-grained sediments; (2) the constructed regulator on the outflowing Carksuyu stream results in a higher sedimentation rate of clay-sized material on the NE corner of the lake, which is extraordinary in the shelf environment.					; Gürer, Ömer/A-9893-2008; Gurer, Omer/A-9893-2008	GURBUZ, ALPER/0000-0002-8448-9629; Gurer, Omer/0000-0001-7210-769X													0943-0105					NOV	2008	56	2					299	307		10.1007/s00254-007-1165-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1165-0													WOS:000260363600008
J	Jones, IJ; Moss, B; Eaton, JW; Young, JO				Jones, IJ; Moss, B; Eaton, JW; Young, JO			Do submerged aquatic plants influence periphyton community composition for the benefit of invertebrate mutualists?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. It has been suggested that submerged aquatic plants can influence the periphyton which grows on their surfaces, making it nutritionally beneficial to snails. In return, preferential feeding by snails clears the plants from a potential competitor, with both plants and grazers gaining from this mutualistic relationship. 2. A highly replicated experiment was conducted, in which the nature of the plant (isoetid and elodeid types compared with similar shaped inert substrata), the nutrient availability (10-200 mu g L-1 P, 0.2-4 mg L-1 N) and the influence of periphyton grazers, Physa fontinalis, were controlled. The plants were cleaned of periphyton before use and an algal inoculum added to all treatments. At the end of the growth period, quantitative measures of the periphyton community composition were made and related to the treatments using both ordination and analysis of variance. 3. Grazing had the largest influence on community composition and algal numbers. A community of unicellular and adpressed filamentous forms developed in the presence of snails, and of erect filamentous forms in their absence. Three algal species, Cocconeis placentula, Chamaesiphon incrustans and Aphanochaete repens, increased in real numbers in the presence of snails, probably as a result of reduced competition whilst being able to withstand grazing. 4. The second largest effect was the influence of host plant. However, differences between the two artificial plants were as great as between the real plants and their artificial counterparts, indicating that physical structure was as important as any active contribution by the plants. Nutrients had a small but significant effect on community composition, but not all species responded in the same way to nutrient enrichment. 5. Although submerged aquatic plants exert an influence over the community composition of the periphyton which develops on their surfaces, it is unlikely that they manipulate it to make it more attractive to grazers such as snails.

J	Smith, VH; Bennett, SJ				Smith, VH; Bennett, SJ			Nitrogen:phosphorus supply ratios and phytoplankton community structure in lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biotic factors regulating the species composition of natural biotic communities unfortunately is still very limited. Numerous hypotheses and descriptive frameworks have been proposed in the literature in an attempt to account for the patterns in phytoplankton community structure that we observe in lakes. Resource-ratio theory is prominent among these competing frameworks. However, because it is equilibrium-based, resource-ratio theory has drawn considerable criticism as a basis for describing and predicting the trends in phytoplankton species composition that occur in natural aquatic ecosystems. BULGAKOV & LEVICH (1999) have provided evidence that is broadly consistent with this theory. We present here a much broader review of some of the evidence supporting the resource-ratio hypothesis of phytoplankton community structure. We also present new experimental data that are consistent with strong effects of nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios on the structure and function of algal communities.																			0003-9136					AUG	1999	146	1					37	53																WOS:000082969700004
J	Behling, H; Hooghiemstra, H				Behling, H; Hooghiemstra, H			Environmental history of the Colombian savannas of the Llanos Orientales since the Last Glacial Maximum from lake records El Pinal and Carimagua	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Late Quaternary environments have been studied by pollen analysis of lake sediments from the savannas of the Colombian Llanos Orientales at 180 m elevation. The pollen record form Laguna El Pinal (4 degrees 08'N, 70 degrees 23'W), dated by 6 AMS radiocarbon dates, starts at 18,290 C-14 yr B.P. The record from Laguna Carimagua (4 degrees 04'N, 70 degrees 14'W), also dated by 6 AMS dates, starts at 8270 C-14 yr B.P. Both records show a landscape dominated by grassland savanna with only few woody savanna taxa, such as Curatella and Byrsonima, frequent fires, and little occurrence of forest and/or gallery forest along the rivers. The savanna ecosystem at the studied sites was relatively stable during the last 18,000 yrs, but minor changes in floral composition, and in the proportion of savanna/forest, have been recorded. Very little gallery forest and the non permanent lake conditions of Laguna El Pinal reflect the driest period, interpreted to reflect low rainfall rates and long dry seasons during the Last Glacial Maximum until 10,690 C-14 yr B.P. During the Late Glacial, Laguna El Pinal was a permanent shallow lake, and changed into a lake with higher water levels during the Holocene, indicating wetter conditions. Expansion of regional gallery forest also started at around 10,690 C-14 yr B.P. Little vegetational change observed in Laguna Carimagua at 5570 C-14 yr B.P., in combination with a simultaneous decrease of savanna observed in previously studied lakes, suggest a change to regional wetter conditions. Thus, the Holocene before 5500 C-14 yr B.P. was somewhat drier than the following period until about 3850 C-14 yr B.P. In both records, Late Holocene lake deposits are incomplete. Shore vegetation of Laguna Carimagua always included a minor contribution of the palms Mauritia and Mauritiella. The marked increase of palms during the last c. 3800 yrs points to increased human impact on the vegetation under the wettest Holocene climate regime.																			0921-2728					MAY	1999	21	4					461	476		10.1023/A:1008051720473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008051720473													WOS:000080288200007

The gross energy content ranged from 3.83 to 11.49 MJ/kg. With increasing fat content in the fishes, water content decreased and dry matter content increased. Th-rough this interdependence, a significant correlation was found between dry matter and crude fat and energy content (r(2)=0.92-0.97). The values of crude protein, crude ash, NFE, nitrogen and phosphorus did not show any significant influence on dry matter content (r(2)=0.0005-0.46). Based on the significant correlation between dry matter and gross energy (gross energy [MJ/kg]=0.0253 dry matter [%](1.6783)), the energy content of freshwater fishes can easily be estimated by the dry matter content in the total body.																			0175-8659					JUN	2001	17	3					142	144																WOS:000171077400008
J	Minckley, T; Whitlock, C				Minckley, T; Whitlock, C			Spatial variation of modern pollen in Oregon and southern Washington, USA	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Surface sediments from 95 lakes provide information on the spatial variation of modern pollen spectra in Oregon and southern Washington. Percentages for 13 pollen types were compared within and between vegetation zones to characterize regional patterns of pollen spectra. The percentage data were also compared with climate variables to determine relationships between pollen percentages and regional climate gradients. The composition of modern pollen spectra corresponds well with the distribution of the pollen producers. Most pollen assemblages were generally dominated by Pinus, but those west of the Cascade Range were dominated by Alnus. Low percentages of Pseudotsuga/Larix, Tsuga mertensiana, Abies, and Picea pollen coincided with local occurrence of the trees. The distributions of the pollen data were arranged along gradients of temperature and effective moisture. West of the Cascade Range, Alnus, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga/Larix, and Cupressaceae pollen were abundant and correlate well with moderate temperature and high effective moisture. In the shrub-steppe and woodlands east of the Cascade Range, where effective moisture is low, Artemisia, Cupressaceae, and Pinus pollen were dominant. At high elevations, Pinus, T. mertensiana, Abies, and Picea were common pollen types in areas with short growing seasons and high effective moisture. Pollen percentages collected from lake surface sediments, moss polsters, and soils were compared within a number of vegetation types to assess their similarity. The three types of sample yielded similar results for forested areas, but lake sediment samples from upper- and lower-treeline sites captured a more regional picture of the vegetation.

J	Piper, WH; Tischler, KB; Klich, M				Piper, WH; Tischler, KB; Klich, M			Territory acquisition in loons: the importance of take-over	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												We examined patterns of territory acquisition and reconnaissance in common loons, Gavia immer, from northern Wisconsin. Among all territory acquisitions, 41.5% occurred through passive occupation of territories left vacant after the death or desertion of a previous resident, 17% constituted founding of new territories and the remaining 41.5% came about through, take-over: either usurpation of defended territories or appropriation of territories before the seasonal return of previous owners. Take-overs occurred in both sexes, but individuals acted alone, never in pairs. Displaced breeders usually took refuge on undefended lakes near their former territories; about half of these loons later regained former territories through passive occupation or took possession of new territories elsewhere. As predicted by the reconnaissance hypothesis, usurpations occurred most often in territories that had produced chicks during the previous 12 months, suggesting that loons use the presence or absence of chicks as a cue for territorial usurpation. Large individuals of both sexes held onto territories longer than small individuals, an indication that body size might be correlated with fighting ability. In terms of life history, loons appear to locate good territories through reconnaissance, usurp them in a subsequent year and recover from displacements by reclaiming their original territories or new ones.

J	Opermanis, O				Opermanis, O			Appearance and vulnerability of artificial duck nests to avian predators	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Use of artificial nests in studies of nest success in birds has become increasingly popular, but this practice has been criticised because the appearance and success of artificial nests may differ from natural nests. Typically, artificial nests are presented with few visible eggs throughout the entire exposure period while natural nests during their life have different appearances, possibly producing stage-dependent predation rates. In ducks, nests may appear with openly visible eggs, eggs covered with nest material and covered by an incubating female. To test how nest appearance may affect nest survival, I simulated such duck nest appearances, and used direct observations to record responses of marsh harriers Circus aeruginosus, the dominant duck nest predator at the Lake Engure, Latvia, during the breeding seasons 2000-2002. I recorded 274 harrier flights over all types of artificial nests, 74 nest discoveries and 54 predation events. Logistic regression analyses showed that nest appearance was a significant predictor of the fate of the nest: nests with openly visible eggs were discovered more often than nests covered with nest material. Nests with dummy females had discovery rates similar to the average of all artificial nest types suggesting that they best reflect the predation risk of artificial nests and could be used in future studies. After discovering nests covered with dummy females, harriers never attacked but tried to scare them off to get access to the eggs. In 52% of cases of nest discovery, harriers gave up before touching the dummy. This shows that duck passive nest defence may prevent clutch predation.																			0908-8857	1600-048X				SEP	2004	35	5					410	415		10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03243.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03243.x													WOS:000224286600005

We recorded five species : Daphnia magna, D. pulex, D. longispina, Siniocephalus exspinosus and Moina brachiata. D. magna was the most abundant species and the only one present all year round. Total abundance of Cladocera varied significantly between wetlands and months, and was highest in the largest, deepest, least saline wetlands. For a given wetland and month, abundance increased at points of greater depth or lower salinity. Species richness of Cladocera was highest in those seasons and lakes where salinity was lowest, and in those seasons and lakes where cladoceran abundance was highest. These wetlands hold a particularly high number of waterbird species, but a very low number of Cladocera species. Ready dispersal via waterbirds does not appear to promote cladoceran diversity in this system, owing to local conditions such as high salinity. We suggest that the conservation value of wetlands for birds is not a good predictor of value for Cladocera.					; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Green, Andrew John/0000-0002-1268-4951; 													0003-4088						2005	41	2					73	81		10.1051/limn/2005010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2005010													WOS:000230232000001

AQUACULTURE												The purpose of this study was to characterize some quality descriptors of wild Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis, taking into account spatial and temporal variability and to situate quality in reared perch in comparison with wild perch variability. Two different natural systems (Leman Lake and the Rhine River) were selected to characterize perch quality variability during an entire biological cycle. Farmed perch quality was studied in relation to the rearing system (extensive, semi-extensive and intensive systems). Using the morphometric, technological and color descriptors, it was shown by Principal Components Analyses (PCA) that in the Rhine River, fish had compact body and caudal fin, large mouth and head and possessed a more reddish caudal fin, in comparison to fish from Leman Lake that are brighter. Seasonal variations were different according to the natural system. In the lacustrian system, fish presented low seasonal variations contrary to the Rhine River system for morphometric and color variables. The technological attributes showed the highest degree of seasonal variation, e.g. fillet yield was high in July. These technological variables were found as being the main discrimination way between fish from the different rearing systems. The intensive rearing system produced perch with higher hepatosomatic index (I-H) and perivisceral fat index (I-PF) compared with the extensive and semi-extensive rearing systems. Moreover, the more intensive rearing conditions were, the more fat deposits increased. It was also found that reared perch possessed wild-like quality characteristics, except for some technological variables (viscerosomatic index: I-V and fillet yield: Y-F). Furthermore, perch from the semiextensive system had the most similar quality attributes with fish from the Rhine River. Thus, morphology and color (i.e. color of caudal fin) appeared to be pertinent quality descriptors for wild fish, whereas technological attributes were more adequate for the characterization of reared fish quality. This study also suggested some hypothesis about the direct or indirect relationships between abiotic factors, such as chemical water characteristics, transparency, temperature and quality attributes.

While C-13-depleted carbon derived from biogenic methane can substantially contribute to the benthic secondary production in deep stratified lakes, its role in shallow lakes is less clear. We investigated the dynamics of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in the larvae of Chironomus plumosus throughout an annual cycle in two ecologically distinct basins (open-water plankton-dominated and sheltered macrophyte-covered) of a large (270 km(2)), shallow, polymictic and eutrophic lake (Vortsjarv, Estonia, North Europe). The larval stable isotopic compositions were linked to the presence of methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) in larval guts and sediments. 2. Molecular detection of MOB revealed their presence in various sediment types, but stable isotope (SI) analysis revealed clear differences in the feeding of chironomid larvae between the plankton-and macrophyte-dominated habitats. 3. In the plankton-dominated habitat, the mean delta C-13 values of larvae remained relatively constant (-38.3% to -35.5%) and corresponded closely to the sediment delta C-13 values. Mean delta C-13 values of chironomid larvae were generally lower in macrophyte-dominated habitats (-43.4% to -33.0%), and both seasonal and individual variation in larval delta C-13 values were more pronounced. MOB presence in larval guts proved a dietary contribution from biogenic methane in macrophyte-dominated habitats. Both the SI and molecular results indicated that MOB could help support larvae even during the cold temperature-limited and ice-covered periods. 4. Our study indicates that methane-derived carbon makes a low but steady contribution to the larval chironomids throughout an annual cycle in large shallow Vortsjarv. However, this contribution can be substantially higher in the lake habitats with abundant macrophytes. The study provides further evidence that a carbon flow pathway from biogenic methane can contribute to the benthic food web under variable habitat conditions in a shallow polymictic lake.

Distribution of Sedimentary Pigments and Macrozoobenthos in the Deepwater Part of the Rybinsk Reservoir	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability of content of sedimentary pigments and biomass of macrozoobenthos in the Rybinsk Reservoir (Russia) are analyzed on the basis of studies performed in 2009-2015. Specific features of the macrozoobenthos distribution depending on the characteristics of biotopes, including the content of sedimentary pigments, water depth, and water content in bottom sediments and their air-dry volumetric mass, are revealed. Correlation and principal-component analyses revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between the biomass of macrozoobenthos and the sum content of sedimentary chlorophyll a and pheopigments.

J	Qian, SS; Borsuk, ME; Stow, CA				Qian, SS; Borsuk, ME; Stow, CA			Seasonal and long-term nutrient trend decomposition along a spatial gradient in the Neuse River watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Neuse River Estuary in North Carolina has recently received considerable public attention for severe algal blooms, large fish kills, and outbreaks of toxic microorganisms. To investigate the belief that nutrient enrichment has worsened in recent years, we analyzed long-term and seasonal trends in nutrient concentrations along the river and estuary employing seasonal trend decomposition using local regression analysis (STL). The nonparametric nature of the STL approach makes it possible to identify nonlinear trends and seasonal interactions that would be missed by traditional trend detection methods. The results indicate that while there may have been minor increases in nitrogen concentrations at upstream locations over the past twenty years, those changes are not reflected in the lower river and estuary. However,the pronounced decreases in phosphorus concentrations that occurred upstream, corresponding to a phosphorus detergent ban in 1988, do persist downstream. The net result is that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus concentrations in the estuary has increased considerably in the last 10 years. When compared with the Redfield value, ambient nutrient ratios suggest that phytoplankton growth in the estuary may be experiencing a shift from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation during much of the year. This shift may be inducing a change in the biotic Community that would help explain the perception of worsening eutrophication, despite an overall reduction in nutrient concentrations.

J	Fuentes, N; Güde, H; Straile, D				Fuentes, Norka; Guede, Hans; Straile, Dietmar			Importance of allochthonous matter for profundal macrozoobenthic communities in a deep oligotrophic lake	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												This study evaluates the nutritional importance of allochthonous matter supply for profundal macrozoobenthic communities and determines abundances and carbon sources used by chironomids and oligochaetes at two sampling sites with different allochthonous contributions, in the deep oligotrophic waters of Lake Constance. Site AL, characterized by sedimenting organic matter (POMsed) with a more allochthonous origin was dominated by oligochaetes, whereas site AU characterized by POMsed of predominantly autochthonous origin, was dominated by chironomids. Total macroinvertebrate abundances were 1020 times higher at site AL compared to site AU. At site AL microbial biomass per gram dry sediment (indicated by ATP content and bacterial abundances) was lower, whereas microbial activity (incorporation of leucine, respiration of glucose) was higher than at site AU. A higher metabolic activity at site AL was also indicated by steeper oxygen gradients in sediment microprofiles. Mean 13C stable isotope signatures of oligochaetes (13C=33.24 +/- 1.27 parts per thousand) and, to an even greater extent, of the dominant chironomid Micropsectra sp. (13C=40.08 +/- 1.65) at site AL were depleted compared to site AU for oligochaetes (13C=30.19 +/- 0.60 parts per thousand) and chironomids (13C=30.40 +/- 0.75 parts per thousand). At site AL, mean 13C values of chironomids and oligochaetes were 11 parts per thousand and 4 parts per thousand lower, respectively, than mean POMsed 13C. At site AU, benthic macroinvertebrates and POMsed were of comparable magnitude. The lower invertebrate 13C values at site AL suggest an increased contribution of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) to the diet of the benthic organisms. A mixing model based on stable carbon isotopes suggests that at site AL 21 to 44% of chironomid diet and 9 to 19% of oligochaete diet stems from MOB consumption, whereas calculated MOB consumption was zero at site AU. Mean 15N values of chironomids and oligochaetes were higher at both sites compared to POMsed, but at site AL (oligochaetes=7.07 +/- 0.61 parts per thousand, Micropsectra sp.=8.62 +/- 0.30 parts per thousand) the difference was less pronounced than at site AU (oligochaetes=13.71 +/- 0.30 parts per thousand, Micropsectra sp.=14.00 +/- 0.95 parts per thousand). These differences are considered to reflect mainly the degree of biotic processing of POMsed before consumption by invertebrates. Given that autochthonous POMsed, i.e. chlorophyll sedimentation, was comparable at both sites, but differences were observed with respect to total POMsed sedimentation rates, 13C and 15N isotope signatures of POMsed, and microbial activities in the sediments, we suggest that there is a strong contribution of allochthonous POMsed supply to the nutrition of macrobenthic communities at site AL. This suggests that allochthonous carbon supply is at least partly bioavailable and stimulates microbial growth and metabolic activities in lake sediments, which in turn provides additional nutritional sources for benthic organisms. Furthermore, the example of Lake Constance shows that, even in a well-oxygenated oligotrophic lake, at least part of the allochthonous POMsed is made available to higher trophic levels via methane production and MOB biomass.

Female life-history traits of a species pair of threespine stickleback in Mud Lake, Alaska	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Aim: Compare several female life-history traits in a stickleback species pair (i.e. size and age at reproduction, clutch size, egg mass, and reproductive effort) to determine whether time during the reproductive season (early or late) or breeding habitat (vegetation, open sites) significantly affect trait values. Organisms: Sympatric ecotypes of anadromous and resident freshwater threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Time and place: Mud Lake, Cook Inlet region, Alaska, May-July 2003. Results: Both resident and anadromous fish in Mud Lake bred primarily at age 2. Anadromous breeders were larger than resident breeders. Size of reproductive females declined from early to late in the breeding season for both anadromous and resident freshwater populations, but time and breeding habitat were not significant sources of variation in most life-history traits. Clutch mass showed a similar, positive correlation with female body mass in both populations, but clutch size (fecundity) rose more slowly with female size in resident fish. Both ecotypes made eggs of similar size overall, with egg size in resident females increasing modestly with female body size. Both ecotypes showed a trade-off between clutch size and egg mass after adjustment for the level of reproductive effort. The egg mass and clutch mass of both ecotypes were small compared with other Cook Inlet resident and anadromous populations.

We used radio-tracking to assess survival rates of 33 individuals. The juvenile (September-February) survival rate was 0.18, compared with 0.66 over the same time interval for adults. Predation by raptors accounted for almost 2/3 of deaths. Broods were surveyed using pointer dogs in late August. Reproductive success was low, averaging 1.0 chicks/hen. Recruitment into the breeding population was insufficient to balance the observed mortality rates, resulting in a 67% decrease in breeding adults during the four-year study. This happened despite the likely immigration into the study area of dispersing juvenile females from adjacent areas with higher breeding success. An equivalent reduction in the abundance of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus was observed, and this was also associated with years of low breeding success. Management methods that both reduce the impact of raptors on juvenile black grouse survival and improve breeding success are probably required to conserve black grouse in Wales.																			0909-6396	1903-220X				SEP	2007	13	3					231	237		10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[231:SRACOM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[231:SRACOM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000249848700002
J	Spears, BM; Lesack, LFW				Spears, BM; Lesack, LFW			Bacterioplankton production, abundance, and nutrient limitation among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta (western Canadian arctic)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of nutrient availability and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on bacterioplankton production were assessed in six lakes with differing frequencies of river flooding. Bacterial productivity, dissolved nutrients, and DOC were tracked weekly throughout the open-water period of 2001. Inorganic nutrient (N and P) enrichment microcosm experiments were conducted to directly assess the effects of DOC quality (i.e., mixtures of colored and noncolored DOC) and inorganic nutrient limitation on bacterial productivity among the lakes. Averaged over the open-water season, both abundance and production of bacterioplankton increased with decreasing flood frequency (R-2 = 0.61 and R-2 = 0.78, respectively). Reduced bacterial production occurred in frequently flooded lakes, where colored DOC, light attenuation, and phosphate were high but ammonium was low. Bacterial production was greatest in infrequently flooded lakes, where noncolored DOC and ammonium were high but phosphate was low. Bacterial production was enhanced by amendments of inorganic nutrients in duplicate experiments (two-factor analyses of variance). Production was also enhanced in response to higher concentrations of either colored or noncolored DOC following release from inorganic nutrient limitation. Size fractionated (< 1 mu m versus > 1 mu m) N-debt and P-debt bioassays typically showed demand for P and release of N by bacteria in all study lakes.

J	Kumar, MR; Krishnan, KA				Kumar, M. Ratheesh; Krishnan, K. Anoop			Grazing behaviour of tropical calanoid copepods and its effect on phytoplankton community structure	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Netravathi estuary is a micro- to mesotidal, tropical, shallow estuary with an abundant density of phytoplankton. The impact of the zooplankton grazing rate and the selected environmental variables on the phytoplankton community structure was studied seasonally from 2017 to 2019. Microplanktons of centric diatoms such as Skeletonema costatum and Cosinodiscus radiatus dominated during monsoon seasons, whereas dinoflagellates such as Peridiniumsp. and Ceratium furca were observed in high numbers at the estuary during non-monsoon seasons. Water temperature showed a strong association with grazing rates of microzooplankton (r = 0.910). Canonical correspondence analysis studies established an intensification in grazing rate during non-monsoon seasons by calanoid copepods which in turn occasioned the reduction of microplanktons belonging to diatoms. Moreover, during monsoon seasons, diminution in grazing rates of calanoid copepods coupled with the presence of micro larvae as a secondary consumer of zooplankton resulted in the proliferation of centric diatoms. The grazing behaviour of microzooplankton affected the phytoplankton species diversity of the estuary in a negative manner (D = 0.29 in 2017 Pre-M, D = 0.76 in 2019 Pre-M). Selective grazing behaviour of calanoid copepods concerning temperature alteration exerted a strong influence in determining the phytoplankton community structure of the estuary to a great extent.

POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DAMS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE EXPANSION OF HYLID FROGS ASSOCIATED WITH AQUATIC MACROPHYTES	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The Fluorescent Frog (lloana punctata) and the Uruguay Harlequin Frog (Lysapsus limellum) are two hylid species found in seasonal swamps and along large rivers in South America. Despite their wide distribution in the Amazon and Parana River basins, they had never been recorded along the margins of the more than 340 km of the Parana River in the provinces of Misiones, Itapua, and Alto Parana in Argentina and Paraguay. Comparisons of historical and recent satellite images and analyses of the Parana River structure indicate that the lake formed after the construction of the Yacyreta Dam (140,000-160,000 ha), which has made novel lentic and semi-lentic environments in the tributary streams identified as large inlets, bays, and lagoons. These transformations favored permanent settlement of aquatic macrophytes, mainly Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and floating ferns (Salvinia sp.), which are the characteristic habitat of L. limellum and B. punctata. Because of these changes, we conducted surveys by boat and from shore to determine whether these frog species colonized the novel environments. We found L limellum and B. punctata at several localities on the margins of Parana River within the boundaries of the Yacyreta Lake. Because all observations of both species were at sites with abundant macrophytes, and because neither of them were found in field surveys we conducted before 2011 (i.e., when the Yacyreta Lake filled to maximum capacity), our results support the hypothesis that the new records are related to the artificial wetlands created after the construction of the Yacyreta Dam.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				AUG	2021	16	2					259	270																WOS:000691788400004

Samples were collected from an urban-industrial site of Bursa, Turkey. A stainless steel pot and a high volume air sampler (HVAS) were employed to collect deposition and ambient air samples, respectively. The dry deposition fluxes of PCBs ranged from 3600 to 56,000 pg m(-2) d(-1) while the total PCB concentrations collected simultaneously were between 35 and 348 pg m(-3). The average dry deposition flux value was in line with the previously reported values. Possible variations in PCB fluxes were likely due to PCB and total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations, and meteorological conditions. No seasonal trends were observed for the bulk deposition samples. The 3- and 4- chlorobiphenyls (CBs) were abundant homolog groups in bulk and concentration samples with ratios of 67% and 90%, respectively. Apparent bulk deposition velocities were calculated by dividing the dry deposition flux value by particle phase air concentration values of PCBs measured with HVAS. The calculated apparent dry deposition velocities ranged from 0.23 cm s(-1) to 3.09 cm s(-1) (aver +/- SD, 0.74 +/- 0.23 cm s(-1)).					; Tasdemir, Yucel/AAG-9468-2021; Esen, Fatma/AAG-8469-2021	Cindoruk, S.Siddik/0000-0001-7536-0332; 													1093-4529	1532-4117					2008	43	11					1252	1260		10.1080/10934520802177797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934520802177797								18642148					WOS:000257752000004

Lateral exchange of larval fish between a restored backwater and a large river in the east-central USA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Exchange of larval fish between a river's main channel and its floodplain backwaters is compromised by sedimentation. Restoration projects to reduce sediment loading are being implemented in large rivers of the midwestern United States to curb backwater habitat loss and restore backwater-to-river connectivity. During 2004 and 2005, drift nets were set bidirectionally (with and against the flow) within a constructed channel between the Illinois River and an adjacent, 1,100-ha restored backwater, Swan Lake, to investigate the interplay between life history strategies and lateral drift on a diet and seasonal basis. Ambient larval density and species composition within the river and backwater also were quantified. Drift was positively correlated with water velocity in the main stem during 2004, and an estimated 32.3 x 10(6) larvae drifted at the surface of the channel into Swan Lake. In the absence of a flood in 2005, the density and composition of the larval fish assemblage in Swan Lake and the Illinois River appeared to drive larval drift timing, magnitude, and composition. Swan Lake's restoration has maintained some river connectivity and lateral drift functionality for resident fish, but its functionality compared with natural, connected river-backwater systems remains unknown.

The upper L-T limit for consumed prey was c. 40% of the predator L-T. All brown trout, however, preferred small (< 10 cm L-T) and avoided large (>= 10 cm L-T) prey. The results also suggested that equal densities of similar-sized (4-10 cm L-T) fish of the two prey species led to random foraging on these species by brown trout, but if either one of the prey species predominated (> 50%) in the lake, brown trout shifted to foraging on this species almost exclusively. Brown trout diets thus reflected the density dynamics of the two alternative prey species.

To better understand what controls gastropod community, monthly investigations were carried out in four Yangtze lakes during December, 2001-March, 2003. Composed of 23 species belonging to Pulmonata and Prosobranchia, the community is characterized by the constitution of small individuals. The average density and biomass were 417 +/- 160 ind/m(2) and 18.05 +/- 7.43 g/m(2), with maxima a-round August. Submersed macrophyte biomass is shown to be the key factor affecting species number, density, and biomass of gastropods. Accordingly, a series of annual and seasonal models yielding high predictive powers were generated. Preference analyses demonstrated that pulmonates and prosobranchs with different respiratory organs prefer different macrophyte functional groups.

J	Hayakawa, K				Hayakawa, K			Seasonal variations and dynamics of dissolved carbohydrates in Lake Biwa	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The MBTH method was used to determine total dissolved carbohydrate (DCHO) concentrations in Lake Biwa on a monthly basis during a 22 month study. Three fractions of DCHO were analyzed: monosaccharides, HCl-hydrolyzable (HCl-CHO), and HCl-resistant polysaccharides (HR-CHO). The HR-CHO fraction was determined as the concentration difference after hydrolysis by 2 M H2SO4 after swelling with 6 M H2SO4 and hydrolysis by 0.09 M HCl (i.e. HCl-CHO). Neutral aldose composition of samples from the epilimnion and hypolimnion were determined in samples collected in July 1998 and February 1999 by GC/FID and GC/MS. Low recoveries of standard carbohydrates after mild acid hydrolysis suggests that lake DOM likely contains structural polysaccharides or glycoproteins. In field observations, the HR-CHO fraction was produced and consumed rapidly by aquatic organisms. The HCl-CHO fraction was the major fraction among the DCHO in lake water, and consisted of microbially labile and refractory components. The aldose composition of the HCl-CHO fraction indicated modification of the DCHO by heterotrophic consumers. The abundance of the HCl-CHO in the lake water can be maintained by the high activity of heterotrophs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the results of canonical correspondence analysis and variations on phytoplankton composition and biomass two distinct stages were recognised. The first was characterised by low phytoplankton biomass with dominance of Aulacoseira distans and cryptomonads (D and Y assemblages composed by C-strategists (invasive) small, relatively fast-growing species). In the second period Microcystis aeruginosa (M assemblage; an S-R strategist), Anabaena spiroides (H assemblage; R-strategist; ruderal) and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (H-Sn assemblage; R-strategist; ruderal) dominated with a high biomass. Abundances of A. distans and cryptomonads were positively associated with NO3- and N/P ratio and negatively with temperature and light. Cyanobacteria abundance was negatively associated with NO3- and N/P ratio, and positively associated with temperature and light. D and Y assemblages were selected by conditions of mixing and low light during the cold-dry season. The increasing daily stratification and decreasing nitrogen availability, mainly DIN, favoured the M assemblage, and M. aeruginosa bloomed when DIN concentrations were < 5 muM With severe nitrogen limitation, H and H-Sn assemblages of N-fixing species were favoured and dominated the community.

During early diagenesis most of the particulate P formed in the water was redissolved. No net transformation into species that would resist dissolution was observed. It was shown that the phosphorus (P) content and the P flux of settling particles varied seasonally over one order of magnitude particles became enriched with reductant soluble P (BD-P) while settling through the hypolimnion changes in BD-P were highly significantly correlated with changes in reductant soluble iron (BD-Fe) bacteria oxidising Fe and Mn seemed to be mainly responsible for this increase in P concentration other fractions including organic P did not change during sedimentation most of the organic P and of the Fe bound P and 70 % of TP was released from the sediment during early diagenesis the sediment surface did not act as a trap for P migrating upwards from deeper sediment layers CaCO3 sedimentation contributed little to P sedimentation but significantly to the permanent burial of P.

J	Miesen, F; Dahl, SO; Schrott, L				Miesen, Floreana; Dahl, Svein Olaf; Schrott, Lothar			Evidence of glacier-permafrost interactions associated with hydro-geomorphological processes and landforms at Snohetta, Dovrefjell, Norway	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Glacier-permafrost interactions are investigated to understand glacial-hydrological influence along a partly glacierised valley on the NE flank of the Snohetta massif, Dovrefjell, southern Norway. Of particular interest is how processes are controlled by a hydrological connection between landforms. Field mapping identified an ice-marginal landsystem comprising a polythermal glacier, a proglacial lake, an ice-cored moraine complex and a river-lake with perennial frost mounds. A clear interaction between glacial and periglacial processes was observed in transitional landforms, most prominently in the ice-cored moraine which constitutes a permafrost environment that is directly reworked by glaciofluvial processes. The role of this interaction in controlling seasonal, partial drainage of the proglacial lake was assessed using remote sensing-based observations of lake surface size evolution and seasonal surface subsidence. Results suggest a two-fold threshold for lake drainage: Depending on the dynamics of glacial discharge and active layer depth, the ice-cored moraine may either act as a barrier or a pathway to meltwater exiting the glacier. This demonstrates the importance of meltwater dynamics in controlling landform evolution in a glacial-periglacial landscape. To further assess the importance of surface and subsurface hydrology in linking glacial and periglacial domains, water stable oxygen isotope ratios across the study area were studied to map the flow of meltwater from glacier to permafrost. Results include a model of the surface and subsurface hydrology in the catchment and promote a conceptual understanding of water as a thermal, hydraulic and mechanical agent of transient glacier-permafrost interaction operating at heterogeneous timescales.

Two types of undulating littoral zones were selected: natural reed belt and bare lakeshore. The reed belt affected nitrogen transformation and was sink for internal-lake nitrogen, whereas the bare lakeshore showed little effect. During the growing season, NO3--N concentration increased by up to 3-5 times from open water to reed belt, while NH4+-N concentration decreased. It suggested that nitrification was the main nitrogen process in reed belt. Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) showed little spatial variation, indicating that most of nitrogen released from sediment did not move into open water again. Significant temporal variation of dissolved nitrogen occurred and was similar in both the littoral zone and the open water. Maximum TDN and NH4+-N concentrations occurred in January, and NO3--N in March. Minimum NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations occurred in July and August, respectively. An increasing total soil nitrogen was found in the surface sediments from reed belt to open water. This further suggested that the reed-covered littoral zone had strong nitrogen transformation potential.					; Wang, Weidong/HNQ-7724-2023; Wang, Hongjun/D-6911-2014	Huang, Peisheng/0000-0002-8347-7175; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2007	581						97	108		10.1007/s10750-006-0494-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0494-4													WOS:000244992800011

In order to study the dynamics of primary production and decomposition in the lake littoral, an interface zone between the pelagial, the catchment and the atmosphere, we measured ecosystem/atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in the littoral zone of an eutrophic boreal lake in Finland during two open water periods (1998-1999). We reconstructed the seasonal net CO2 exchange and identified the key factors controlling CO2 dynamics. The seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was related to the amount of carbon accumulated in plant biomass. 2. In the continuously inundated zones, spatial and temporal variation in the density of aerial shoots controlled CO2 fluxes, but seasonal net exchange was in most cases close to zero. The lower flooded zone had a net CO2 uptake of 1.8-6.2 mol m(-2) per open water period, but the upper flooded zone with the highest photosynthetic capacity and above-ground plant biomass, had a net CO2 loss of 1.1-7.1 mol m(-2) per open water period as a result of the high respiration rate. The excess of respiration can be explained by decomposition of organic matter produced on site in previous years or leached from the catchment. 3. Our results from the two study years suggest that changes in phenology and water level were the prime cause of the large interannual difference in NEE in the littoral zone. Thus, the littoral is a dynamic buffer and source for the load of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon to small lakes.

Phosphorus (P) release from bottom sediments is an important source of nutrient enrichment in many lakes in sedimentary basins, such as those in western Canada. On the Boreal Plain, sediment P release is particularly strong during periods of seasonal anoxia. 2. In this study, the effects of reduction-oxidation (redox)-sensitive and -insensitive chemicals on P release were examined in sediment cores collected from three eutrophic lakes. 3. Contrary to expectations, redox-sensitive treatments were no more effective at lowering total phosphorus (TP) in sediment cores than some redox-insensitive treatments. Redox-sensitive treatments with FeCl3 and FeCl3 + O-2 reduced TP to 8 and 6%, respectively, of reference concentrations, whereas redox-insensitive treatments with alum or lime + alum reduced TP to 14% of reference concentrations. Lime and O-2 treatments reduced TP concentrations to 35 and 52% of reference concentrations, respectively. 4. The fraction of P that adsorbed and co-precipitated with iron and aluminium in the sediment cores was low (non-apatite phosphorus fractions < 5%), suggesting that P release was controlled by apatite solubility and bacterial metabolism.																			0046-5070					AUG	2001	46	8					1061	1074		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00789.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00789.x													WOS:000170565800005
J	Xu, YY; Shao, ML; Cao, M; Zhou, SC; Cai, QH				Xu, Yaoyang; Shao, Meiling; Cao, Ming; Zhou, Shuchan; Cai, Qinghua			Using temporal coherence to determine the responses of water clarity to hydrological processes in a giant subtropical canyon-shaped reservoir (China)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Investigating whether different locations of a large lake exhibit synchronous or asynchronous fluctuations in limnological characteristics is essential to lake management. If synchronous fluctuations (termed as "temporal coherence") among sites are found to prevail, regional factors are likely to be the drivers; otherwise, local factors may be dominant. Here, this idea is tested at two spatial scales: the large scale being the mainstream of Three-Gorges reservoir (TGR, China) and the small scale being Xiangxi Bay of TGR. Data of transparency and chlorophyll a were gathered monthly at 26 sampling sites from July 2003 to July 2006 to evaluate temporal coherence for water clarity. High spatial and temporal variation in transparency (4-510 cm) and chlorophyll a (0.1-190.2 mu g/L) mark the system. For the mainstream of TGR, significant high temporal coherence of water clarity among sites (correlation analysis: 0.872 <= r <= 0.991, mean r = 0.960) was detected and the among-site correlations showed no significant relationship with geographical distance (Mantel test: r = -0.186, p > 0.05) or chlorophyll a (Mantel test: r = 0.249, p > 0.05). By contrast within Xiangxi Bay, lower synchronous fluctuations (correlation analysis: 0.396 <= r <= 0.971, mean r = 0.785) occurred, and the among-site correlations decreased with an increase in geographical distance (Mantel test: r = -0.715, p <0.01) and a decrease in temporal coherence of chlorophyll a (Mantel test: r = 0.893, p <0.01). Seasonal dynamics of water clarity were very well explained by inflow discharges (regression analysis: 0.771 <= R-2 <= 0.906) and water residence time (0.782 <= R-2 <= 0.918) in the mainstream, but not in Xiangxi Bay. The high coherency of the dynamics of water clarity in TGR mainstream is likely caused by regional hydrological processes driven by subtropical monsoon climate. For Xiangxi Bay, local processes such as phytoplankton dynamics may override the regional effects of hydrological processes, because the water clarity of this bay is strongly determined by phytoplankton bloom dynamics.

Two Histosol pedons, located in different floodplains that refer to different sedimentation environments, were sampled in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Morphological, physical, and chemical characterization were performed, and the total C and N content of the substrate and the C content of humic substances were assessed. Elemental C and N and isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were performed every 10 cm, while C-14 dating of the humin fraction was performed at 40-50 and 190-200 cm. The interproxy approach combining pedological analyses, radiocarbon dating, and elemental and isotopic analyses of total C and N of organic matter, showed a mixture of algae and continental\terrestrial organic matter deposited in peatlands, over the last similar to 4000 cal years before present (BP). The studied soils were formed by geogenic and pedogenic processes (terrestrialization, paludization, and aggradation). Considering the relationships between delta C-13 and delta N-15, between C/N and delta C-13, and the soil characteristics, these deposits were probably formed by vertical accretion in lake environments. However, near 2300 cal yr BP, the radiocarbon dating and isotopic analyses suggest the occurrence of deposition of alluvial sediments transported by the Surui River in RJ-01. It is likely that the modern age obtained by C-14 dating in RJ-02, near 3600 cal yr BP, is probably due to the intense bioturbation by plant roots and the input of young material during the seasonal flood period.					; da Silva Neto, Eduardo/AAD-3301-2019; Pereira, Marcos/F-1585-2018; Pessenda, Luiz/G-1776-2012; Anjos, Lucia Helena/F-8436-2012; Pinheiro Junior, Carlos/GNP-2346-2022	Pinheiro Junior, Carlos Roberto/0000-0002-2721-6704; Pereira, Marcos/0000-0002-1402-3612; Ruiz Pessenda, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-9119-8195													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2021	207								105612	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105612	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105612		JUL 2021											WOS:000703268900037

Several factors predispose forested watersheds to N saturation, including chronically high rates of N deposition, advanced stand age, and large pools of soil N. Many watersheds in the eastern United States exhibit symptoms of N saturation. A sequence of recognizable stages produces characteristic long-term and seasonal patterns of lake-water and stream-water NO3- concentrations that reflect the changes in rates and relative importance of N transformations as these watersheds become more N sufficient. The early stages of N saturation are marked by increases in the severity and frequency of NO3- episodes. The later stages of N saturation are marked by elevated baseflow concentrations of NO3- from groundwater. The most advanced symptoms of N saturation usually occur in regions with the most elevated rates of N deposition. Long-term increases in surface-water NO3- have important implications for surface-water acidification, but probably will not lead to freshwater eutrophication.

J	Marques, JC; Pardal, MA; Nielsen, SN; Jorgensen, SE				Marques, JC; Pardal, MA; Nielsen, SN; Jorgensen, SE			Analysis of the properties of exergy and biodiversity along an estuarine gradient of eutrophication	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Benthic eutrophication often gives origin to qualitative changes in marine and estuarine ecosystems, for example the shift in primary producers, often followed by changes in species composition and trophic structure at other levels. Through time such modifications may determine a selected new trophic structure. The development of structural dynamic models will allow to simulate such changes, using goal functions to guide ecosystem behaviour and development. The selection of other species and other food web may then be accounted by a continuous optimisation of model parameters according to an ecological goal function. Exergy has been applied in structural dynamic models of shallow lakes, and appears to be one of the most promising approaches. Theoretically, exergy is assumed to become optimised during ecosystems development, and ecosystems are supposed to self organise towards a state of an optimal configuration of this property. Exergy may then constitute not only a suitable system-oriented characteristic to express natural tendencies of ecosystems evolution, but also a good ecological indicator of ecosystems health. Biodiversity is also an important characteristic of ecosystems structure, constituting a powerful and traditional concept, which was found to be suitable to test the intrinsic ecological significance of exergy. We examined the properties of exergy (exergy and specific exergy) and biodiversity (species richness and heterogeneity) along an estuarine gradient of eutrophication, testing the hypothesis that they would follow the same trends in space and time. This hypothesis was validated in a certain extent, with exergy, specific exergy and species richness decreasing as a function of increasing eutrophication, but heterogeneity responding differently. Biodiversity measurements and their interpretation appeared subjective. Exergy and specific exergy may be a suitable alternative, that could be used as goal functions in ecological models and as holistic ecological indicators of ecosystems integrity. Nevertheless, since exergy and specific exergy showed to respond differently to ecosystems seasonal dynamics, it is advisable to use both complementary. The method proposed by Jorgensen et al. (1995) to estimate exergy, which takes into account the biomass of organisms and the thermodynamic information due to genes, appeared to be operational. There is nevertheless an obvious need for the determination of more accurate (discrete) weighing factors to estimate exergy from organisms biomass. We propose to explore the assumption that the dimension of active genomes, which are primarily a function of the required genetic information to build up an organism? are proportional to the relative contents of DNA in different organisms.

We analyzed the habitat use, size structure and sex ratio of the species on Algodoal-Maiandeua Island, a protected area on the Northeastern coast of the Brazilian state of Para. Four distinct habitats (coastal plain lake, flooded forest "igapo", interdunal lakes, and tidal channels) were surveyed during the rainy (March and April) and dry (August and September) seasons of 2009, using hoop traps. For the analysis of population structure, additional data were taken in March and August, 2008.A total of 169 individuals were captured in flooded forest (igapo), lakes of the coastal plain and, occasionally, in temporary pools. Capture rates were highest in the coastal plain lake, possibly due to the greater availability of the fruits that form part of the diet of R. p. punctularia. Of the physical-chemical variables measured, salinity appeared to be the only factor to have a significant negative effect on capture rates. The sex ratio was only slightly biased to females, and did not vary between habitats or seasons. Straight carapace length was significantly larger in females, but did not vary between habitats. Overall, the evidence indicates that both biotic and abiotic factors like food availability, low current and salinity, influence the habitats selection and use by R. p. punctularia on Algodoal-Maiandeua Island.

From 2008-2010, a breeding survey of Reddish Egrets was conducted in Great Inagua to 1) document breeding status, 2) document breeding phenology, and 3) estimate the number of breeding pairs. A total of 87 Reddish Egret nests on Great Inagua over two breeding seasons were recorded; the proportion of white, dark and mixed-morph nesting pairs varied but averaged (+/- S.D.) 68.4 +/- 7.5, 18.2 +/- 2.4, and 13.4 +/- 5.1%, respectively. Based on these surveys, the breeding season range extends from December to May, varying annually due to changes in precipitation. Territorial aggression of solitary nesting pairs in Reddish Egrets was observed, previously unreported for the Caribbean. Damage to mangrove islands from Hurricane Ike in September 2008 appeared to increase nesting concentrations on Lake Rosa; solitary nesting decreased from 36% before, to 10% after the hurricane. Because the surveys before and after the hurricane did not encompass the entire breeding seasons, increased concentration of nesting may have been influenced by other factors besides Hurricane Ike. Even with incomplete breeding season surveys, these estimates of nesting pairs indicate a >50% decrease in number of breeding pairs of Reddish Egret on Great Inagua since the 1980s; this is a conservation concern as the population is distinct.

During the study, a total of 18 taxa of invertebrates dwelling on the above plant species were identified, with the exact number of taxa varying in time: 11 taxa were noticed in April and May, and in June their number went up to 13. The examination of hydrochemical parameters of the oxbow lake waters revealed that the density of macrofauna was lower at higher values of proper conductivity and macronutrients, ammonia nitrogen and COD, increasing at high levels of sulphates. High concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and non-organic components coincided with decreased biomass of epiphytic animals on water soldier. Additionally, it has been observed that elevated concentrations of potassium ions have a negative influence on the biomass of most epiphytic animals (except Erpobdella sp.).					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; Kobus, Szymon/0000-0002-1106-3918; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286													1644-2296					MAR	2009	14	1					119	133																WOS:000264853700013

D.; Menounos, Brian			Late Holocene paleohydrology of Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We have gained new insight into the dynamic late Holocene paleohydrology and paleolimnology of Kluane Lake by reconstructing lakewater delta O-18 using sediment cellulose as an oxygen-isotope archive. Our data suggest that the lake was regularly open hydrologically between 5000 and 1000 cal year BP, although with substantially lower water levels and with greater evaporative loss in relation to inflow than under contemporary conditions. During part of this period the lake was meromictic and may have undergone intermittent hydrologic closure, but southward drainage to the Pacific Ocean via the Alsek River system was generally maintained. Isotopic evidence confirms that Kluane Lake underwent complete hydrologic closure 430-300 cal year BP (AD 1520-1650) after a major advance of Kaskawulsh Glacier blocked southward drainage. Closure persisted as the lake overtopped the Duke River fan, initiating northward drainage to the Bering Sea via the Yukon River system. Although incision of the new outlet channel led to a rapid decline in lake level, northward discharge via the Kluane River has been maintained for the past three centuries because of abundant inflow from the Slims River. Substantial quantities of glacial meltwater and seasonal runoff continue to drain via the Slims River from Kaskawulsh Glacier and its catchment in the St. Elias Mountains. During this period Kluane River has also become an important route for migrating anadromous salmon. The modern isotope hydrology of Kluane Lake confirms that its current positive water balance is highly dependent on discharge from Slims River. Declining glacial meltwater contributions to Slims River will likely lead to lower water levels in Kluane Lake over the coming decades and possible re-establishment of intermittent or perennial hydrologic closure.					; Brahney, Janice/H-3591-2019; Clague, John/L-3619-2019	Brahney, Janice/0000-0001-7614-2855; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2010	44	3					873	885		10.1007/s10933-010-9459-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9459-8													WOS:000281973500009

J	Darmody, RG; Thorn, CE; Harder, RL; Schlyter, JPL; Dixon, JC				Darmody, RG; Thorn, CE; Harder, RL; Schlyter, JPL; Dixon, JC			Weathering implications of water chemistry in an arctic-alpine environment, northern Sweden	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper reports on some of the chemical characteristics of late melt-season water from Karkevagge ("valley of the boulders") above the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden. Included in the analyses were temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, SO4, NO3, K, SiO2, Mg, Mn, Na, Fe, and Al. These were measured in rain, late-lying snow, and water from the major stream and lake, as well as from pond, tributary,:ind seep sources in the valley. A total of 71 samples was collected at 57 sites between August 6 and August 23, 1996 for the purpose of characterizing the present weathering regime within this classic U-shaped glacial valley. Evidence of chemical weathering included increases in solute concentrations over precipitation inputs and a source-related, wide variation in water chemistry. The dominant anion measured in surface water was SO4. That, along with the presence of CaSO4 coatings on streambeds, indicates that pyrite oxidation may contribute to the weathering regime. High SO4 concentrations were associated with gypsum-coated streambeds and seeps that emerge from the bedrock. Low SO4 concentrations were associated with tributaries flowing primarily on fresh rock and originating from melting snow. Estimated chemical denudation rate fur the valley, corrected for atmospheric inputs, was 19.2 tons/km(2)/yr. Although this is lower than previously reported, our research supports earlier work indicating that chemical weathering is a major component of mass wasting in this arctic-alpine environment.

Stable isotope composition (6180) of end-members varied between -7.5 and -8.0%. For groundwater, -7.3 and -8.5%. for river-water and -4.5 and -8.0- for precipitation. Water samples were extracted from six nests each comprising three porous cup samplers at depths or 0.2 m, 0.5 m and 1.0 m between June 2000 and October 2001, and their isotope compositions determined. Groundwater appears to be the main source of water to the wetland, but stable isotope ratios enable seasonal variations in the contribution of precipitation to be determined, and indicate the extent of precipitation storage within the wetland.

More than 150 protistan taxa were identified based on morphology. Species richness and microbial biomass measured via microscopy and flow cytometry increased along a stream - lake ( Lake Erie) transect and peaked at the confluence. Water column ammonium ( NH4+) uptake (0.06 to 1.82 muM N h(-1)) and regeneration (0.04 to 0.55 muM N h(-1)) rates, measured using (NH4+)-N-15 isotope dilution, followed the same pattern. Large light/dark NH4+ uptake differences were observed in the hypereutrophic OWC interior, but not at the phosphorus-limited Lake Erie site, reflecting the microbial community structural shift from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Despite this shift, microbial grazers ( mostly choreotrich ciliates, taxon-specific growth rates up to 2.9 d(-1)) controlled nanophytoplankton and bacteria at all sites by consuming 76 to 110% and 56 to 97% of their daily production, respectively, in dilution experiments. Overall, distribution patterns and dynamics of microbial communities in OWC resemble those in marine estuaries, where plankton productivity increases along the river - sea gradient and reaches its maximum at the confluence.

J	Psenner, R				Psenner, R			Living in a dusty world: Airborne dust as a key factor for alpine lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												For a long time studies on precipitation and lake-water chemistry have focussed on the deposition of strong acids. Dust in snow and rain was analyzed much less intensively, but recent findings suggest that it may be the missing link which explains why many low-alkalinity lakes in the Alps and the Pyrenees did not become acidic and nutrient levels are seasonally high, whereas lakes in areas which are rarely influenced by dust depositions, for instance in Scandinavia, have acidified. Beside being a dominant factor for nutrient inputs to oceans, rain forests and remote lakes, dust can also play a major role in global warming and cooling, and it may significantly contribute to soil formation at mountain sites in the Mediterranean. I suggest that future changes in dust deposition and warming will be key factors for the development of alpine lakes.																			0049-6979					JUN	1999	112	3-4					217	227		10.1023/A:1005082832499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005082832499													WOS:000080721900001

Remote sensing data from multiple satellites covering the 2003-2019 period were analyzed. The planting dates in rain-fed paddies ranged from April to August, with large spatial variations and year-to-year fluctuations. In years when planting was suppressed in April and May, planting was extensively enhanced in June and August compared to normal years, and vice versa. Over the northeastern side of Tonle Sap Lake and south of Phnom Penh city, the areas planted in April and May were found to have positive correlations with rainfall and soil moisture, suggesting that wetter-than-average conditions encouraged farmers to plant earlier in the season. In contrast, this relationship was unclear on the western side of Tonle Sap Lake, where the rainfall amounts were larger throughout the year than in other areas in Cambodia. In this region, the relationship between the planting area and soil water availability was either unclear or was even slightly negative from June to August. Since more frequent dry spells have been detected after the onset of the rainy season in recent years, further studies and disseminations of potential changes in dry spells are important for the agronomic adaptation of planting dates under climate change.

Seasonal plankton succession in warm-water lakes, however, is not as well known. Recent theory suggests that some lake systems are characteristic of having alternate system-states, where one of the system-states is characterized by dominance of cyanobacteria, and transition between system-states can be abrupt and undeterminable. Lake Somerville, a shallow, well-mixed, warm-water reservoir located in eastern TX, U.S.A., experiences occasional periods of cyanobacteria dominance. To increase our understanding of seasonal plankton dynamics in warm-water systems, we analyzed 14-years of plankton data spanning a 22-year period. During this period, succession dynamics characteristic of those described by the PEG-model were observed, as well as succession dynamics expected during periods of cyanobacteria dominance, i.e., greater accumulated phytoplankton biovolume, low secondary productivity, and low light penetration. In addition to the PEG-model and cyanobacteria type system-states, other states of the system that were intermediate between these were observed. Therefore, we conclude the lake does not behave according to the alternate system-states model. The change from year to year in early-year cyanobacteria dominance was abrupt and non-monotonic during this period. In addition, the early year performance of cyanobacteria appeared to influence the plankton succession trajectory for the remainder of the season. While the magnitude of lake-flushing early in the year accounted for similar to37% of variability in cyanobacteria prevalence, many of the traditional factors impacting cyanobacteria dominance appeared insignificant.

Seasonal variation in species richness and abundance of waterbirds in Mole National Park, Ghana: Implication for conservation and ecotourism	KOEDOE												Mole National Park is the largest and the oldest national park in Ghana and an important bird area, yet its waterbird fauna is poorly documented because it is situated in the northern ecological zone far away from the coast of Ghana. Information on the seasonal variation in the park's bird abundance and diversity is generally patchy but necessary for effective birdwatching planning and management of the park's birds. Therefore, as a guide to potential ecotourists interested in waterbirds, this study described the seasonal variation in waterbird species diversity and abundance at Mole National Park. As waterbirds mostly congregate around open wetlands and their abundance is more appropriately determined by counting all individuals in the congregant, data were collected using the total area count of waterbirds from August 2015 to October 2015 (the wet season) and from December 2015 to February 2016 (the dry season). Secondary data on arrival of tourists in the park were also analysed. The park's waterbird species richness was 29 in the dry season compared to 18 in the wet season. There was significant difference (p < 0.05) in the abundance of waterbirds in the dry season in which 4014 waterbirds were encountered compared to 646 in the wet season. The yearly tourist arrival data at Mole National Park shows an increasing trend with peak visitation period occurring during the wet season. The chances of tourists encountering more species and numbers of waterbirds in the park are higher in the dry season compared to the wet season. Conservation implications: Species richness and abundance of waterbirds in Mole National Park varied according to the wet and dry seasons with both the number of species and abundance higher in the dry season than the wet season. It is therefore indicative that most birdwatchers who visit the park in the wet season miss out on a number of species and numbers of waterbirds. To achieve effective birdwatching, management should schedule birdwatching activities to coincide with the dry season as the chances of encountering more species and numbers of waterbirds are higher.

Investigation of water displacement through either ET or precipitations, runoffs and infiltrations may provide significant contributions for water resources management practices. In this study, daily, monthly, and seasonal ET maps were generated for Minoz Stream Watershed of Kavak town of Samsun province with the aid of energy balance-based METRIC model for the water-year of 2007. Resultant ET maps were assessed through vegetation covers, land use patterns, actual precipitations, and runoff parameters. In a previous study carried out over the same watershed, amount of water to be converted into ET was calculated as 517.0mm for water-year of 2007. In present study, total ET for the relevant period of the same watershed was estimated as 610.0mm. Estimated ET value was slightly greater than the total quantity of water to be converted into ET. Present ET maps were also well complied with the land use patterns.

The species composition and quantity of riparian soil seed banks collected from four hydro-fluctuation belts were assessed by simulating different submersion cycles to determine the effects of reverse seasonal water-level fluctuations on the germination and persistence of soil seed banks in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region. Results showed the number of species that germinated from the soil seed bank decreased with submersion. The number of germinated seeds in soil seed banks after submersion for 7 months in Xingshan, Zigui, Wanzhou, and Zhongxian decreased by 60%, 53%, 57%, and 57%, respectively, relative to the control. The species diversity index and seed density of germinated seeds in soil seed banks also significantly decreased with prolongation of submersion time. Seed density decreased by 93%, 83%, 76%, and 72%, respectively, after 7 months of submersion. Species composition and dominance within the soil seed bank changed over time due to submersion. In general, reverse seasonal submersion negatively impacts the germination and persistence of soil seed banks. The response of soil seed bank germination and persistence to reverse seasonal submersion became the key factor determining the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the soil seed bank in hydro-fluctuation belts due to the large differences in submersion time between areas at various elevations.

J	Özdemir, K; Gügör, Ö				Ozdemir, Kadir; Gungor, Omer			Development of statistical models for trihalomethane (THM) removal in drinking water sources using carbon nanotubes (CNTs)	WATER SA												This research developed models using the multiple linear regression technique for prediction of trihalomethane (TRIM) removal from chlorinated drinking water sources through a combination of a coagulation process with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Terkos Lake water (TLW), Buyukcekmece Lake water (BLW) and Ulutan Lake water (ULW) samples were coagulated by a conventional coagulant (alum) and increasing doses of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with the addition of alum. Also, chlorination experiments were conducted with water reservoirs from TLW, BLW and ULW, with different water quality regarding bromide concentration and organic matter content. The factors studied affecting THM removal were contact time, chlorine dose, coagulation process, total organic carbon (TOC), and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA). Statistical analysis of the results focused on the development of multiple regression models, as Models 1 and 2, for predicting total trihalomethane (TTHM) based on the use of contact time, SWCNTs and MWCNTs doses, chlorine dose and TOC. When the two models were compared, Model 1 proved best suited to describe THM removal for the three water sources. The developed models provided satisfactory estimations of THM removal; the model regression coefficients for Models 1 and 2 were 0.88 and 0.77, respectively. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 0.083 and 0.126 confirm the reliability of the two models. The results show that THM removal can be simply predicted by using the multiple linear regression technique in chlorinated drinking water sources.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2018	44	4					680	690		10.4314/wsa.v44i4.17	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v44i4.17													WOS:000449438500017

The farming community of the area is scary of continual use of irrigation waters received through the Danastar Wah; they are of the view that the constant use of this water will ruin their fertile lands into salt-affected soils. Thus, keeping in view the fears of the farmers of the command area of Danastar Wah, a study was carried out to investigate the water quality of the Manchar Lake, RBOD MNV (Main Nara Valley) drain and Danastar Wah, and to examine soil salinity status of the area using Geo-referenced field and satellite imagery data for Kharif season of the year 2015. The results of the study showed that the EC (Electrical Conductivity) of the Danastar Wah water was below 1.2 dS/m. Thus, the water was suitable for irrigation purpose. In all the water samples, Na+, Ca2+ + Mg2+ and CO3 concentrations were found within the permissible limits, while no concentration of HCO3 was found in any of the water samples. In the command area, clay texture was dominant down to a depth of 60 cm soil profile. In the area about 37, 28, and 30% of the soils were normal (non-saline), saline and sodic, respectively; while only 5% of soils were saline-sodic. The cotton crop was identified as the major Kharif crop, occupying about 13.76% (2,844 ha) of the total command area, followed by rice crop grown on about 5.21% (1,078 ha) of the command area. The overall accuracy of image classification was 90% with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the water of the Danastar Wah can be used for irrigation purpose during Kharif season only with the condition that adequate land drainage is maintained. It is also suggested that before using the water of Manchar Lake, RBOD and Danastar Wah for Rabi season, analysis for water quality be conducted. Geo-Informatics (GIS and RS) tools can be employed for spatial and temporal monitoring of water quality of the Manchar Lake.

J	Dai, XG; Liu, Y; Wang, P				Dai Xin-Gang; Liu Ye; Wang Ping			Warm-dry collocation of recent drought in southwestern China tied to moisture transport and climate warming	CHINESE PHYSICS B												This study aims to investigate the recent drought in southwestern China and its association with environmental changes in moisture transport (MT) and atmospheric circulation. Climatic Research Unit grid data, in situ observations in China, and ERA-interim reanalysis are used to study the characteristics of the drought and the associated mechanism. Recent precipitation trends show a pattern of "Northern wetting and Southern drying", similar to the anti-phase of the climate pattern prevailing during 1980-2000 in mainland China; southwestern China incurred a severe drought during 2009-2013. Wavelet analysis reveals that the drought coincides with a warm-dry phase of temperature and precipitation on a period of about 20 years and beyond 100 years, where contributions account for 43% and 57% of the deficiency of the precipitation, averaged for 2003-2012, respectively. A further investigation reveals that the drought results chiefly from the decline of the southwestern monsoon MT toward southwestern China, in addition to mid-latitude circulation changes, which leads to more blockings near the Ural Mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk in the rainy season and negative anomalies around Lake Baikal and northeast China in the dry season. These anomalies are likely to be correlated with global sea surface temperature changes and need to be studied further.																			1674-1056	2058-3834				APR	2015	24	4							049201	10.1088/1674-1056/24/4/049201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-1056/24/4/049201													WOS:000354727300085

Using oxygen and hydrogen sulfide as natural chemical tracers, the time scale of chemical change was identified in relation to advection, mixing and biological processes. Rapid changes due to advection that took place on an hourly time scale were removed by referring the data back to the temperature of the water. Biological activity dominated the hydrochemical changes observed in the meta- and upper hypolimnion. These were expressed by DO depletion rates of 2.0 and 0.4 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Vertical and horizontal mixing were shown to occur on a seasonal time scale. Once the chemical stratification process was completed the slow mixing through the benthic boundary layer became the limiting factor for subsequent reactions in the water column.					; Eckert, Werner/AAP-9335-2021	Eckert, Werner/0000-0002-2361-6911; 													0168-2563					DEC	2002	61	3					291	307		10.1023/A:1020206511720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020206511720													WOS:000178066500004
J	Carrington, ME; Mullahey, JJ				Carrington, Mary E.; Mullahey, J. Jeffrey			Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens) Flowering and Fruiting Response to Time Since Fire	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens [Bartr.] Small) is a shrubby palm common in southeastern US pine flatwoods ecosystems. Demand recently has increased for fruits for the herbal remedies market. Because only wild saw palmettos are harvested, management strategies are needed to promote flowering and fruiting. This study investigated effects of time since growing season (April July) fires on flowering and fruiting of saw palmetto ramets >= 54 cm in height, in 18 pine flatwoods or dry prairie sites (six sites in three locations, burned in 1996, 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, or before 1991) in central and southwest Florida from 1996 to 1999. We used repeated measures, linear mixed models to test for time since fire effects on proportion of ramets flowering, proportion of ramets fruiting, and fruit yield. Ranges of means among sites over all years of the study for proportion of ramets flowering, proportion of ramets fruiting, and fruit yield were 0 to 0.78, 0 to 0.72, and 0 kg.ha(-1) to 2 869 kg.ha(-1), respectively. Time since fire strongly influenced flowering; highest probability of flowering occurred 1 yr after burning, followed by an abrupt decrease 2 yr after burning, then a gradual increase from 3 to 5 yr after fires (polynomial regression, P < 0.0001 for fixed effects). Probability of fruiting increased with increasing time since fire (quadratic regression, P < 0.001 for fixed effects), but fruit yields showed no pattern in response to time since fire (P=0.916). The decrease in influence of fire from flowering through fruit maturity presumably was caused by mortality from factors such as caterpillar predation and fungal infection. To promote increased flowering and fruit yields, we recommend that growing season burns be conducted approximately every 5 yr. We suggest, however, that management strategy be modified as necessary to maintain ecosystem diversity and function.

The objectives of this study were to examine whether delta C-13(Zoo) and delta N-15(Zoo) can be better indicators of primary productivity and trophic state than the stable isotope composition of suspended particulate organic matter (POM), and to evaluate the relationship between delta C-13(Zoo) and delta N-15(Zoo) and select environmental variables. The delta C-13(Zoo) in these reservoirs was enriched in August and depleted in December, and varied significantly along the continuum of trophic levels. By contrast, delta N-15(Zoo) was depleted in August and enriched in December, and did not increase significantly with an increase in trophic state. Both delta C-13(Zoo) and delta N-15(Zoo) were more strongly correlated with environmental factors than delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM) were. In addition, more environmental factors were significantly correlated with delta C-13(Zoo) and the delta N-15(Zoo) than with delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM). When data from two seasons were pooled, delta C-13(Zoo) was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and the DIN:SRP ratio, while delta N-15(Zoo) was weakly correlated with nutrient concentrations. This study indicates that, compared to the stable isotope composition of POM, delta C-13(Zoo) is a better indicator of primary productivity and trophic state, while delta N-15(Zoo) may be used as a proxy for nitrogen sources in aquatic ecosystems.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2013	14	1					97	104		10.1007/s10201-012-0388-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-012-0388-2													WOS:000313359300011

ESTIMATION OF EVAPORATION IN THE BANABUIU DAM, IN THE STATE OF CEARA, BRAZIL, BY DIFFERENT COMBINED METHODS, DERIVED FROM THE PENMAN EQUATION	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA												The state of Ceara, Brazil, has 75% of its area covered by Brazilian semiarid, with its peculiar features. In this state, the dams are constituted in water structure of strategic importance, ensuring, both in time and space, the development and supply of water to population. However, construction of reservoirs results in various impacts that should be carefully observed when deciding on their implementation. One of the impacts identified as negative is the increased evaporation, which constitutes a major component of water balance in reservoirs, especially in arid regions. Several methods for estimating evaporation have been proposed over time, many of them deriving from the Penman equation. This study evaluated six different methods for estimating evaporation in order to determine the most suitable for use in hydrological models for water balance in reservoirs in the state of Ceara. The tested methods were proposed by Penman, Kohler-Nordenson-Fox, Priestley-Taylor, deBruim-Keijman, Brutsaert-Stricker and deBruim. The methods presented good performance when tested for water balance during the dry season, and the Priestley-Taylor was the most appropriate, since the data from de simulated water balance with evaporation estimated by this method were the closest of the water balance data observed from measures of reservoir level and the elevation-volume curve provided by the Company of Management of Water Resources of the state of Ceara - COGERH.

A NOTE ON THE SPECIAL FILLET FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF THE DWARF CARP (CYPRINUS CARPIO CARPIO) LIVING IN THERMAL LAKE HEVIZ, HUNGARY	ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA												Fatty acid (FA) composition of the fillet and the intestinal content of dwarf common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) living in Lake Heviz was determined in wintertime collected samples and results were compared to widespread literature data on carp. Fillet FA profile of the thermally adapted (28 degrees C) Heviz dwarf carps differed from profiles originated from divergent culture and feeding conditions in the overall level of saturation. Fillet myristic acid proportions largely exceeded all literature data in spite of poor dietary supply. Fillet fatty acid results indicate the effects of thermal adaptation (high saturation level) and the correlative effects of feed components rich in omega-3 fatty acids, with special respect to docosahexaenoic acid. With the application of discriminant factor analysis the Heviz sample was accurately differentiated from the literature data on carp fillet fatty acid profile, mostly based on C14:0, C18:1 n9, C18:2 n6, C20:1 n9 and C20:4 n6 FAs. In summary, fillet FA profile suggested thermal adaptation, location specificity and the ingestion of algal and bacterial material.					; Febel, Hedvig/IQV-1945-2023; Bazar, George/A-2986-2013; Hancz, Csaba/E-8385-2016; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019; Bazar, Gyorgy/A-2986-2013	Szabo, Andras/0000-0002-5315-0024; Hancz, Csaba/0000-0001-9730-063X; Muller, Tamas/0000-0002-0512-4315; Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; Bazar, Gyorgy/0000-0001-9829-4366; Febel, Hedvig/0000-0002-9867-0664													0236-5383	1588-256X				JAN	2013	64	1					34	44		10.1556/ABiol.64.2013.1.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ABiol.64.2013.1.4								23567829					WOS:000317566200004

Use of seasonal freshwater wetlands by fishes in a temperate river floodplain	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study examined the use of freshwater wetland restoration and enhancement projects (i.e. non-estuarine wetlands subject to seasonal drying) by fish populations. To quantify fish use of freshwater emergent wetlands and assess the effect of wetland enhancement (i.e. addition of water control structures), two enhanced and two unenhanced emergent wetlands were compared, as well as two oxbow habitats within the Chehalis River floodplain. Eighteen fish species were captured using fyke nets and emigrant traps from January to the beginning of June, with the most abundant being three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and Olympic mudminnow Novumbra hubbsi. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch was the dominant salmonid at all sites. Enhanced wetlands, with their extended hydroperiods, had significantly higher abundances of yearling coho salmon than unenhanced wetlands. Both enhanced and unenhanced emergent wetlands yielded higher abundances of non-game native fishes than oxbow habitats. Oxbow habitats, however, were dominated by coho salmon. Fish survival in the wetland habitats was dependent on emigration to the river before dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased and wetlands became isolated and stranding occurred. This study suggests that wetland enhancement projects with an outlet to the river channel appear to provide fishes with important temporary habitats if they have the opportunity to leave the wetland as dissolved oxygen levels deteriorate.

The lifespan of fathead minnows inhabiting lakes prone to winterkill was 1-2 years shorter than those in less disturbed lakes. In populations prone to winterkill, fish displayed faster growth rates and grew to a larger size-at-age, particularly during the first year of life. Although lower population densities in winterkill lakes probably contributed to this increased growth, adults in these populations tended to spawn earlier in the season than the smaller adults in more stable populations. Fathead minnows in lakes prone to winterkill also matured at an earlier age and allocated a greater proportion of their body mass to gonads than conspecifics in the more benign, stable lakes. These trends are consistent with predictions for organisms in variable, unpredictable environments and, because fathead minnows are tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions, suggest that variation in life-history traits among populations is probably a product of both selection and phenotypic plasticity.

J	D'Arcy, P; Carignan, R				D'Arcy, P; Carignan, R			Influence of catchment topography on water chemistry in southeastern Quebec Shield lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												For 30 Canadian Shield lakes of southeastern Quebec, catchment slope and lake morphometry account for 50-70% of the variability of chlorophyll a (Chi a), dissolved organic carbon (DOG), total phosphorus (TP), NO3-, and NH4+. Dissolved organic carbon, TP, Chi a, Ca, and Mg are negatively related to catchment slope, whereas NO3- and NH4+ increase with increasing slope. Concentrations of more conservative constituents (SO42-, Na, K) increase with decreasing elevation as a result of higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation at low elevations. Catchment variables (slope, drainage area, percent wetlands) are as good predictors of Chi a (r(2)= 0.7) as are water chemistry variables (TP, Ca, Mg, and pH). Dominant vegetation (deciduous vs. coniferous) has little or no influence on lake water chemistry. Hydrogeological data for the Canadian Shield suggest that, during periods of high runoff, the development of waterlogged areas and the importance of overland flow on saturated soils are inversely proportional to catchment slope. We propose that the strong influence of catchment slope on water quality is due to slope-dependent seasonal waterlogging, which determines the fate (retention or export to surface waters) of dissolved substances produced within and moving through the forest floor.																			0706-652X					OCT	1997	54	10					2215	2227		10.1139/cjfas-54-10-2215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-10-2215													WOS:000071517900001

The aim of this study was to assess the nest temperatures of an American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) population on the central coast of Oaxaca state in Mexico. The fieldwork was carried out from February to June 2018 at Palmasola Lagoon, Oaxaca. Ten natural nests of C. acutus were carefully excavated to determine clutch size. When putting the eggs back in the nests, we placed a data logger in the center of the egg mass to determine the temperature parameters in the nest chamber environment, as well as the variation in temperature during the incubation period. All nests were revisited to count the number of hatched eggs (NHE) and to determine the hatching success (HS), along with the duration of the incubation period (IP). Hatching success was 89.04%. The mean clutch size in the American crocodile nests was 30.7 +/- 7.83 eggs (ranging from 17 to 46 eggs), and the mean incubation period was 77.6 +/- 5.89 days. The mean nest incubation temperature throughout the reproductive season was significantly different among nests. Based on the average temperature during the middle third of the incubation period, the nests should have produced both sexes, but with a higher proportion of males. This study tried to elucidate the impact of nest temperatures during the incubation period on embryo survival, as well as hatchling sex ratio in a local climate on the central coast of Oaxaca.					; Grajales, Jesús/AAW-8673-2021	Barragan, Rene/0000-0002-2735-6280; Martinez Ramirez, Emilio/0000-0002-0570-5013; Garcia-Grajales, Jesus/0000-0001-6663-0388													0306-4565	1879-0992				JUL	2021	99								103012	10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103012								34420642					WOS:000687787300004

Lipid bound phosphorus in the seston of Lake Erie and its tributaries and its use as an indicator of algal P-limitation	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Concentrations of lipid-phosphorus (LP) in aquatic ecosystems can be influenced by algal biomass and the nutritional state of microbial communities, potentially serving a useful indicator of P-limitation. We examined the effectiveness of LP as a bioindicator by examining concentrations of LP and environmental factors controlling its abundance across Lake Erie and its tributaries. LP concentrations were correlated with chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total suspended solids, total P, and particulate carbon (PC), nitrogen, and P (PP) in both river and lake waters, while dissolved nutrients were only related to lake LP concentrations. Tributary LP was generally higher than in-lake values, and stoichiometric relationships between PC, PP, and LP indicated that Chl a was correlated with tributary LP. Chl a, bacterial production, and LP concentrations decreased significantly across nutrient gradients going from the west to east across the lake. Consistent relationships between lake particulate C:P ratios and Chl a: LP ratios were found across seasons, and higher values of both in August suggested algal P-limitation during this period. To further explore environmental controls on LP, we compared the relative influence of temperature, phytoplankton taxonomy, and water chemistry on lake LP concentrations. Though LP was correlated with well-known factors associated with cyanobacterial abundance in the lake (temperature and ammonium), particulate biomass and algal P-limitation seemed to be the most important correlates of LP concentration, suggesting that Chl a:LP ratios could provide a metric of P-limitation in aquatic ecosystems.					; Prater, Clay/I-5674-2019; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Prater, Clay/0000-0002-9864-6242; , Katie/0000-0001-7636-225X; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A./0000-0003-2307-948X; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2021	83	3							49	10.1007/s00027-021-00806-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00806-7													WOS:000647332800001

This study applied various regression methods, including a regression estimator with five, six, and seven parameters, an estimator enhanced by composite, triangular, and rectangular error corrections with residual and proportional adjustment methods, the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) method, and a simple linear interpolation (SLI) method. Daily discharge and nitrate concentration data were collected by the National Center for Water Quality Research. The methods were compared with subsampling frequencies of 6, 12, and 24 times per year for daily concentrations, daily loads, and annual loads. The results indicate that combinations of the seven-parameter regression method with composite residual and rectangular residual adjustments provided the best estimates under most of the watershed and sampling frequency conditions. On average, WRTDS was more accurate than the regression models alone, but less accurate than those models enhanced by residual adjustments, except for the most urbanized watershed, Cuyahoga. SLI was the most accurate in the Vermilion and Maumee watersheds. The results also provide some information about the effects of rating curve shape and slope, land use, and record length on model performance.					; PARK, DAERYONG/B-3888-2013; Um, Myoung-Jin/AAU-2359-2021; Park, Daeryong/B-3888-2013	Jung, Kichul/0000-0003-0261-0331; Park, Daeryong/0000-0002-7325-5480; Um, Myoung-Jin/0000-0002-5301-7813; Markus, Momcilo/0000-0003-2219-8436														2071-1050				JUL	2021	13	13							7508	10.3390/su13137508	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137508													WOS:000671006400001

K-dominance curves revealed a decrease in phytoplankton diversity from macrophyte dominated area to open pelagic area. Higher phytoplankton and zooplankton densities in macrophyte dominated areas observed during the wet season. Phytoplankton composition highly varied between season in Chenderoh reservoir.

J	Jorgensen, SE; Ray, S; Berec, L; Straskraba, M				Jorgensen, SE; Ray, S; Berec, L; Straskraba, M			Improved calibration of a eutrophication model by use of the size variation due to succession	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecological models may be considered synthesis of our knowledge about a question (problem) associated with an ecosystem. As we know that ecosystems are adaptable systems and are able to shift the species composition, it may often be important that these processes are included in the development of an ecological model. They can be described by optimization of exergy, which have been used successfully to set up prognoses based on ecological models in 13 case studies, in the sense that the models were able to describe the observed change in properties of the core organisms. It would therefore be obvious to examine if the method could also be used to improve the calibration of models. Modellers of very dynamic ecosystems, for instance lakes or rivers, have the experience that it is often very difficult to calibrate the model because one set of parameters cannot fit to the observations that are based on seasonal changes in the species composition, the so called succession. It has been examined whether variable parameters based on a current optimization of exergy and describing the succession would yield a better calibration. The results show that it is, at least in the currently examined case study, possible to improve the calibration by this method. Therefore, it is recommended to test the method further for a later incorporation into a modelling routine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The area is the headwater of tributaries of the main Brazilian hydrographic basins: Amazonian (north), Parana (south), and Sao Francisco (east). At the base of the analysed core there is a clay deposit devoid of palynomorphs. At 30,480 +/- 100 yr BP, peal started to form in the area. Between 25,790 +/- 70 and ca. 24,200 yr BP, pollen grains and algal remains are abundant, indicating a marsh surrounded by open cerrado and patches of gallery forest on top of the plateau. Between ca. 24,000 and 21,450 +/- 100 yr BP, vegetation was denser than at present, with abundant marsh plants and the occurrence of some trees of a cooler climate, suggesting a climate more humid than at present and probably cooler. The absence of Mauritia pollen during that time indicates the palm swamp ("vereda") characteristic of the present-day area did not occur. The drastic decrease in concentration and diversity of palynomorphs from ca. 21,000 yr BP until 7,220 +/- 50 yr BP suggests a dry climatic phase that resulted in drier, more seasonal climate and the desertification on top of the plateau. Shortly after 7,000 yr BP, the abundance of pollen grains and spores increased and Mauritia pollen occurred in the sediments, suggesting increased humidity and the beginning of the palm swamp; from ca. 5,600 yr BP onwards, the present types of vegetation grew on top of the plateau: arboreal cerrado, gallery forest, and palm swamp. The climate of this phase was similar to that of the present. Charcoal particles are found throughout the record but they increase mainly after 2,600 yr BP, suggesting at least three extensive episodes when the local vegetation was burned. The sequence of events found here follows, in general, the same pattern described for other areas in central Brazil. However, the dry climatic phase is more strongly marked in Vereda de Aguas Emendadas, probably due to its location on top of a plateau. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, limited research has explored how DOM quantity and quality respond to global changes and their underlying mechanisms. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using data from 50 published studies. Our findings revealed significant variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a254), and humification index (HIX) across different ecosystems, land uses, trophic gradients, and seasons in global watersheds. Climate, geography, and water quality emerged as key factors influencing DOM dynamics, with chlorophyll a (Chl.a) serving as a primary indicator of spatial DOC variation, and total nitrogen (TN) predominantly regulated a254, while Chl.a also controlled HIX variability. Furthermore, mean annual temperature (MAT) played a vital role in modulating DOM quality and quantity. Given that geographical locations significantly affected climatic conditions and water quality, it indirectly influenced DOM quality, while also directly affecting DOM quality. Moreover, climatic conditions indirectly affected DOM quantity through their impact on water quality, and also had a significant direct effect on DOM quantity. Fluctuations in Chl.a, likely driven by changes in MAT, influenced water productivity, consequently impacting the quantity and quality of DOM. This study highlights the spatiotemporal variability of DOM under climate variability and its significant contribution to the global carbon cycle in response to environmental changes.

In this study, we combined hydrological and statistical models and innovatively reconstructed the inflow to DTL from the three outlets and the Yangtze River water level under the hypothetical condition of no TGR. Through scenario simulations, we quantified the impacts of these changes on water levels in different regions of DTL. The results indicated that during the dry season (December-April), changes in inflow from the three outlets and the Yangtze River water level had opposing effects on DTL water levels. However, the Yangtze River water level dominated, causing water level decreases of 0.3-0.5 m in East DTL, approximately 0.3 m in South DTL, and less than 0.1 m in West DTL. In the wet season (May-August), the impacts of TGR on DTL water levels were more complex but remained primarily controlled by changes in the Yangtze River water level. During the TGR impoundment period (September-November), both factors consistently contributed to significant declines in DTL water levels, particularly in October, with drops exceeding 0.6 m in West DTL, 0.8 m in South DTL, and nearly 1.2 m in East DTL. This study enhances our understanding of how TGR operation affects DTL's hydrological regimes and provides valuable references for assessing the impacts of large reservoirs on downstream lakes in similar river-lake systems.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2025	661		B						133694	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133694													WOS:001517150600002

A four to six weekly sampling program of water quality, submerged macrophytes and macroinvertebrates was undertaken at six wetlands, from September 2002 to February 2004, to investigate seasonal variation in a range of primary and secondary saline systems. The wetlands dried and filled at different times in response to local rainfall patterns, and salinities varied accordingly with evapoconcentration and dilution. Two types of clear-water wetlands were recognised; those dominated by submerged aquatic macrophytes (Ruppia, Lepilaena and Lamprothamnium) and those dominated by benthic microbial communities. Two types of turbid wetlands were also recognised; those with high concentrations of phytoplankton and those with high concentrations of suspended sediments. A primary saline lake and two lakes that have only recently been affected by secondary salinisation persisted in a clear, macrophyte-dominated regime throughout most of the study period, except during drying and filling. Two lakes with a long history of secondary salinisation (70 years) moved between regimes over the study period. A clear, benthic microbial community - dominated regime only persisted at the wetland which contained permanent water throughout the study period. The turbid regimes were only present during drying and refilling phases. A richer and more abundant macroinvertebrate fauna was associated with the clear, macrophyte-dominated wetlands. Our results suggest that the development of management guidelines that recognise the presence of different ecological regimes and that consider the interactions between water regime, salinity, and primary and secondary production will be more useful in protecting biodiversity and ecological function in these systems than managing salinity as a single factor.

J	Toepel, J; Langner, U; Wilhelm, C				Toepel, J; Langner, U; Wilhelm, C			Combination of flow cytometry and single cell absorption spectroscopy to study the phytoplankton structure and to calculate the chl a specific absorption coefficients at the taxon level	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The phytoplankton community structure of a hypertrophic lake was quantitatively determined with the aid of flow cytometry. The flow cytometry signals were calibrated to obtain cell-specific information, such as the chl a content and the biovolume per cell. The reliability of this method was tested with laboratory cultures. The results of the phytoplankton structure in a hypertrophic lake with respect to chl distribution in the different algal groups obtained by flow cytometry were compared with the results from HPLC pigment fingerprinting. Both methods yield the percentage contribution of the different algal groups to total chl a. The chl a specific absorption coefficient of the phytoplankton (a(Phy)(*)) was determined via visible (VIS) spectroscopy of samples taken from a hypertrophic lake (Auensee) in 2003. The results indicated that a(Phy)(*) of the total cell suspension is dependent on the phytoplankton structure as well as on environmental factors. The linear relationship between a(Phy)(*) at 675 nm and the product of the chl a content per cell and the biovolume offered the possibility to normalize phytoplankton absorption spectra to acquire the taxon-specific a(Phy)(*). The estimated a(Phy)(*) (675 nm) values were used to normalize single cell absorption spectra at this wavelength to obtain the a(Phy)(*) between 400 and 750 nm for representatives of the major algal groups. Our measurements show that the absorption coefficient for the whole phytoplankton community varies within the season. Finally, we used the a(Phy)(*) and the chl a distribution to calculate the light absorption of each algal group in the hypertrophic lake.																				1529-8817				DEC	2005	41	6					1099	1109		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00137.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00137.x													WOS:000233829500005
J	Rinke, K; Petzoldt, T				Rinke, K; Petzoldt, T			Modelling the effects of temperature and food on individual growth and reproduction of Daphnia and their consequences on the population level	LIMNOLOGICA												Individual based simulations of population dynamics require the availability of growth models with adequate complexity. For this purpose a simple-to-use model (non-linear multiple regression approach) is presented describing somatic growth and reproduction of Daphnia as a function of time, temperature and food quantity. The model showed a good agreement with published observations of somatic growth (r(2) = 0.954, n = 88) and egg production (r(2) = 0.898, n = 35). Temperature is the main determinant of initial somatic growth and food concentration is the main determinant of maximal body length and clutch size. An individual based simulation was used to demonstrate the simultaneous effects of food and temperature on the population level. Evidently, both temperature and food supply affected the population growth rate but at food concentrations above approximately 0.4 mg C l(-1) Scenedesmus acutus temperature appeared as the main determinant of population growth. Four simulation examples are given to show the wide applicability of the model: (1) analysis of the correlation between population birth rate and somatic growth rate, (2) contribution of egg development time and delayed somatic growth to temperature-effects on population growth, (3) comparison of population birth rate in simulations with constant vs. decreasing size at maturity with declining food concentrations and (4) costs of diel vertical migration. Due to its plausible behaviour over a broad range of temperature (2-20 degreesC) and food conditions (0.1-4 mg C l(-1)) the model can be used as a module for more detailed simulations of Daphnia population dynamics under realistic environmental conditions.

Temporal variation in methane emissions in a shallow lake at a southern mid latitude during high and low rainfall periods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The global methane ( CH4) emission of lakes is estimated at between 6 and 16 % of total natural CH4 emissions. However, these values have a high uncertainty due to the wide variety of lakes with important differences in their morphological, biological, and physicochemical parameters and the relatively scarse data from southern mid-latitude lakes. For these reasons, we studied CH4 fluxes and CH4 dissolved in water in a typical shallow lake in the Pampean Wetland, Argentina, during four periods of consecutive years ( April 2011-March 2015) preceded by different rainfall conditions. Other water physicochemical parameters were measured and meteorological data were reported. We identified three different states of the lake throughout the study as the result of the irregular alternation between high and low rainfall periods, with similar water temperature values but with important variations in dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, water turbidity, electric conductivity, and water level. As a consequence, marked seasonal and interannual variations occurred in CH4 dissolved in water and CH4 fluxes from the lake. These temporal variations were best reflected by water temperature and depth of the Secchi disk, as a water turbidity estimation, which had a significant double correlation with CH4 dissolved in water. The mean CH4 fluxes values were 0.22 and 4.09 mg/m(2)/h for periods with low and high water turbidity, respectively. This work suggests that water temperature and turbidity measurements could serve as indicator parameters of the state of the lake and, therefore, of its behavior as either a CH4 source or sink.					; Gere, Jose/V-6878-2019	Gere, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-2663-8761; Guzman, Sergio A./0000-0001-7179-2840; Fuse, Victoria Susana/0000-0001-9191-2635; Juliarena, Maria Paula/0000-0003-2923-1163													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							590	10.1007/s10661-016-5601-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5601-z								27670888					WOS:000384330800048

Spectral detection of stress-related pigments in salt-lake succulent halophytic shrubs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The spectral detection of vegetation pigment concentrations has a high potential value, but it is still underdeveloped, especially for pigments other than chlorophylls. In this study, the seasonal pigment dynamics of two Tecticornia species (samphires; halophytic shrubs) from north-western Australia were correlated with spectral indices that best document the pigment changes over time. Pigment dynamics were assessed by analysing betacyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations at plant level and by measuring reflectance at contrasting seasonal dates. Plant reflectance was used to define a new reflectance index that was most sensitive to the seasonal shifts in Tecticornia pigment concentrations. The two Tecticornia species turned from green to red-pinkish for the period March-August 2012 when betacyanins increased almost nine times in both species. Chlorophyll levels showed the opposite pattern to that of betacyanins, whereas carotenoid levels were relatively stable. Normalised difference indices correlated well with betacyanin (r = 0.805, using bands at 600 and 620 nm) and chlorophyll (r = 0.809, using bands at 737 and 726 nm). Using knowledge of chlorophyll concentrations slightly improved the ability of the spectral index to predict betacyanin concentration (r = 0.822 at bands 606 and 620 nm, in the case of chemically determined chlorophyll, r = 0.809 when using remotely sensed chlorophyll). Our results suggest that this new spectral index can reliably detect changes in betacyanin concentrations in vegetation, with potential applications in ecological studies and environmental impact monitoring.

Spatial shifts in salmonine harvest, harvest rate, and effort by charter boat anglers in Lake Michigan, 1992-2012	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stocked and naturally reproducing salmonids in Lake Michigan support an economically important charter boat fishery which operates from multiple locations around the lake. Charter boat operators depend on the sustain ability and spatial availability of salmonid species. We analyzed the spatial distributions of charter boat harvest of brown trout, Chinook salmon, coho salmon, lake trout, and rainbow trout from 1992 to 2012. We found that during this 21 year period fishing effort shifted closer to shore, to the west, and to the north. Harvest of some species, namely lake trout and rainbow trout, shifted towards shallower bottom depths and closer to shore. In contrast, harvests of Chinook and coho salmon have not shifted closer to shore in a consistent manner. We suggest that a variety of factors may have contributed to these trends in harvest patterns, including recent ecosystem shifts in Lake Michigan. While we acknowledge that spatial harvest patterns are unlikely to precisely mirror salmonid distribution patterns, we believe that reporting coarse shifts in harvest has implications for future management options including, but not limited to, stocking decisions and harvest regulations.

The primary objective of this study is to identify the spatial patterns of double-season early rice, single-season middle rice and double-season late rice of Hunan Province and Yuanjiang City, China, in 2010, using two kinds of time series remotely sensed imagery: 8-day composite MODIS surface reflectance product data (MOD09A1) and HJ-1A/B satellite images with a 4-day revisit period. The available MODIS and HJ-1 CCD images of transplanting and heading stages were first assured in accordance with the schedules of local traditional paddy fields tillage. Based on the MOD09A1 data product, time series normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were calculated and smoothed to remove the noise and the atmospheric effects. Second, the spatial distribution and planting acreage of three types of rice of Hunan Province were derived from combining the enhanced vegetation index and land surface water index according to the water background and variation characteristics of NDVI values at transplanting and heading stages. Conversely, a two-test procedure was used to finish the identification of paddy rice in Yuanjiang City using time series HJ-CCD imagery. The first test was to derive the potential rice pixels using the NDVI image (a dagger NDVI) between heading and transplanting stages, and the second test was to remove the non-rice pixels using maximum likelihood supervised classification. The experimental results showed that three types of rice were mainly distributed along the Dongting Lake Basin in Hunan Province and the relative errors were -10.99, 1.46 and -5.87 %, respectively, while they were primarily planted in the northern plains of Dongting Lake in Yuanjiang City, where the relative errors were 12.1, 16.7 and 0.8 %, respectively. We conclude that transplanting and heading stages are the best phenological combinations for identifying paddy rice through remote sensing time series analysis, and this study can provide a basis for evaluating paddy rice yield on a large scale .

Rotifers were numerically dominant (81.89%) in the community during the study period; they were followed by Copepoda (10.32%) and Cladocera (7.79%). In the metalimnetic maximum oxygen zone between 5 and 10 m, cladocerans made up 70.1% of the total number of zooplankton in June and 27.3% of the total number of zooplankton in November. Oxygen values decreased at 10 and 15 m in September and November. While the abundance of rotifers and cladocerans decreased as well, cyclopoids increased (60% of total zooplankton at 10 m). Nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphate were at low concentrations. Relationships among zooplankton, abundance, and environmental factors were analyzed using the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). UPGMA cluster analysis was used to illustrate unimodal species distribution by classification into 2 groups. Eigenvalues of axes clarified 42.7% of the cumulative variance in species data and 62.9% of the relationship between species and environmental data in the CCA. Many zooplankton species, rather tolerant to different environmental conditions, are good indicators for water quality and can be used for the biomonitoring of water ecosystems.

This is one of the most important lake district of Argentina, which encompasses a large number and highly diverse unpolluted water bodies. Data from deep and shallow lakes within a trophic and latitudinal gradient are presented. The information focus on abundance, diversity, temporal and spatial dynamics, size and taxonomic structure, trophic interactions, functional groups, in most of the cases related to physical and chemical features. The Andean lakes comprise deep and shallow basins of glacial origin. The phytoplankton abundance and biomass are usually low, and the assemblages are dominated by nanofiagellates (Chrysochromulina parva and Plagioselmis lacustris) and by microphytoplanktonic chrysophyceans and dinoflagellates like Dinobryon spp., Peridinium spp. and Gymnodinium spp., and the diatoms Urosolenia eriensis, Cyclotella stelligera, Fragilaria spp. and Synedra spp. The striking oligotrophy of the lakes in this region is regulated by nitrogen availability; despite the worldwide extend of phosphorus limitation in temperate lakes. Deep Andean lakes have a very high transparency, and deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) develop during the stratification period. These DCM are partially constituted by dinoflagellates, which usually dominate the total phytoplankton biomass in these environments. These results evidence the high impact of light and temperature in the phytoplankton vertical distribution in deep lakes. On the other hand, the numerous shallow Andean lakes represent a varied group of environments with oligotrophic and in some cases mesotrophic conditions. The nanoplankton is also dominant, but the diversity of the microphytoplankton is higher than in deep lakes. They share a great number of species with deep lakes, however, some other groups like chlorococcals, desmids and euglenophytes (i.e. Trachelomonas spp.) usually dominate the phytoplankton assemblage.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47067-9				2014	65						235	256		10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0044													WOS:000339640200016

Results of gillnetting show significant declines in several forage species in absolute and relative abundance since the mid-1990s. Catches have declined for forage species as a group and for individual species such as non-native yellow perch Perca flavescens, native suckers Catostomus spp., and native peamouth Mylocheilus caurinus. In contrast, the aggregate catches of the non-native predators increased greatly as a percentage of the total catch since the 1990s, including increases in catches of walleye Sander vitreus, and northern pike Esox lucius. As a result of the non-native species increases, species diversity has, overall, trended upward whereas species dominance based on the three most abundant species has decreased, as previously abundant forage species have been reduced and greater evenness has resulted. Overall, the fish community in the reservoirs has shifted from a natural, seasonally coldwater riverine system (pre-impoundment) to a modified, coldwater-managed (i.e., salmonid stocked) system in the 1950s through the 1970s to a coolwater system dominated by forage species in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s, and, most recently, to a coolwater system more strongly structured by non-native piscivores. This novel (i. e., native-non-native) community poses some difficult issues for managers on which species to proactively manage for. Additional effort is needed to assess benefits and costs of proactively managing for non-natives as part of successful, comprehensive management plans.																			2330-8249	2330-8257					2014	22	1					97	111		10.1080/10641262.2013.838937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641262.2013.838937													WOS:000343576400006
J	Spencer, DF; Linquist, BA				Spencer, David F.; Linquist, Bruce A.			Reducing rice field algae and cyanobacteria abundance by altering phosphorus fertilizer applications	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												In California's water-seeded rice systems, algal/cyanobacterial biomass can be a problem during rice establishment and can lead to yield reductions. Laboratory, enclosure, and field-scale experiments were established to evaluate the effects of fertilizer P management on algal/cyanobacterial growth. Two field-scale experiments evaluated the response of algal/cyanobacterial growth to three P management strategies: conventional surface applied, incorporated into the soil, and delaying P applications by 30 days. Results from these experiments indicated rice fields that received conventional surface-applied P fertilizer had 4-8 times more algal/cyanobacterial biomass and 3-11 times higher concentrations of soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) than those in which P fertilizer was incorporated or delayed. Laboratory experiments evaluated the ability of field water to support growth of Nostoc spongiaeforme. Results indicate that water from the incorporated or delayed P application fields was P limited for N. spongiaeforme growth. Water from the surface-applied fields was not P limited. Enclosure experiments evaluated the effects of delayed P applications on algal/cyanobacterial biomass and rice yields. Algal/cyanobacterial cover and biomass increased in enclosures which received added P. Soluble reactive phosphate concentrations were also significantly greater in these enclosures. Delaying the application by up to 28 days did not reduce rice yields in the enclosures. One management implication is that reducing SRP concentrations early in the season in rice field water will result in reduced algal/cyanobacterial biomass. Strategies to reduce water SRP include incorporating fertilizer P or delaying the P application by up to 30 days.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				JAN	2014	12	1					147	154		10.1007/s10333-013-0370-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-013-0370-6													WOS:000330624700014

We tested the hypothesis that the trade-off between growth and mortality rates is mediated by foraging activity and habitat use. Thus, if depletion of food by prey is density-dependent, and leads to greater foraging activity and risky habitat use, then visibility and encounter rates with predators must also increase. 2. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally manipulating the density of young rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss ) at risk of cannibalism, in a replicated single-factor experiment using eight small lakes, during an entire growing season. 3. We found no evidence for density-dependent depletion of daphnid food in the nearshore refuge where most age-0 trout resided. Nonetheless, the proportion of time spent moving by individual age-0 trout, the proportion of individuals continuously active, and use of deeper habitats was greater in high density populations than in low density populations. Differences in food abundance among lakes had no effect on measures of activity or habitat use. 4. Mortality of age-0 trout over the growing season was higher in high density populations, and in lakes with lower daphnid food abundance. Therefore, population-level mortality of age-0 trout is linked to greater activity and use of risky habitats by individuals at high densities. We suspect that food resources were depleted at small spatial and temporal scales not detected by our plankton sampling in the high density treatment, because food-dependent activity and habitat use by age-0 trout occurs in our lakes when food abundance is experimentally manipulated (Biro, Post & Parkinson, in press).					; Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009	Biro, Peter/0000-0002-3565-240X; 													0021-8790	1365-2656				JUL	2003	72	4					546	555		10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00724.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00724.x								30893957					WOS:000183969600002
J	Hewitt, CD; Mitchell, JFB				Hewitt, CD; Mitchell, JFB			A fully coupled GCM simulation of the climate of the mid-Holocene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The response of a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model to mid-Holocene insolation forcing is compared with results from an atmospheric model with prescribed present day sea surface temperatures and mid-Holocene insolation. The ocean response increases the amplitude of the seasonal temperature response over land, and increases its lag behind the sc,lar forcing. The typical oceans in the coupled model are coldest. relative to the control, in May at 6ka leading to a relative reduction in evaporation, precipitation and ascending motion over the ocean, and relative ascent and increased precipitation over equatorial Africa. By September, the tropical oceans are warmer than in the fixed SST experiment which leads to increased moisture flux from the oceans into the southeast monsoon, and a larger increase in monsoon precipitation than in the fixed SST experiment. In addition, the enhanced warming of the northern hemisphere SSTs relative to the southern subtropics leads to a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. As a result, increased wetness of the tropical land surface in the mid Holocene experiments is more pronounced and extends further northwards when the sea surface temperatures are allowed to respond. The coupled model results are more in accord with lake level data, especially over North Africa.

Colonial grebes often lose over 50% of nests in any particular breeding season to wave action, depending on factors such as storm activity and habitat quality. We examined nest structure survival in a colony of Western Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) in relation to wave action due to wind. Initial nests were 66% successful in hatching at Lake Christina, Minnesota, in 2005 compared to only 48% in 2006. in 2005, initial nests that survived and hatched young were closer to the central tuber-mat of the colony and closer to individual bulrush island centers prone to wave attack were less likely to last the season and produce young than were nests in central or more protected areas of the colony. Buffer zones stem density was less important than the amount of buffer between nest and wave attack, which may be a major factor colony founders select for when evaluating nest placement sites within a colony.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2008	31	3					402	410		10.1675/1524-4695-31.3.402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695-31.3.402													WOS:000261043500012

Hourly-averaged radar images were processed to observe longshore distributions of shoreline positions. Variations of longshore mean shoreline positions and their fluctuation intensities observed in the years 2005 and 2006 showed a seasonal change which followed the so-called beach-cycle. Longshore pixel intensities close to the waterline were extracted from time-averaged images for every hour of the two years to process longshore time-stack image. Longshore migration speeds of shoreline mega-cusps were estimated by cross correlation analysis of the time-stack image, and the reliability of the method was checked. Migration speeds were compared to measured longshore current speeds at the pier and the longshore component of the wave power, showing that they are highly synchronized for most conditions. Finally, the migration statistics were related to the wave data, and the results showed that the northwards migration rates were typically larger than southwards rates, which was consistent with the statistical results for wave forcing variables. Also, the relationship between the migration speeds and the forcing variables indicates that the migration was more active when the wave incidence angle was close to 45 degrees.

J	Liordos, V; Goutner, V				Liordos, Vasilios; Goutner, Vassilis			Habitat and Temporal Variation in Diet of Great Cormorant Nestlings in Greek Colonies	WATERBIRDS												Diet of Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) nestlings was studied during four consecutive breeding seasons (1999-2002) at three Greek colonies (Axios Delta, Lakes Kerkinin and Mikri Prespa) in order to assess variation and commercial value of prey. A variety of fish taxa were found in nestlings' regurgitates in each area and season, but only one or two dominated by numbers or biomass. Black Goby (Gobius jozo). Round Sardinella (Sardinella aurita) and Twaite Shad (Alosa fallax) were the most important prey in the Axios Delta: Bleak (Alburnus alburnus), Giebel (Carassius auratus gibelio) and Roach (Ruthilus rutilus) at Lake Kerkini; Chalcalburmus belvica and Giebel at Lake Mikri Prespa. Nestling diet varied both seasonally (but only at Lake Kerkini significantly so) and annually (significantly in the Axios Delta and at Lake Mikri Prespa). Temporal changes can be attributed to changes in prey availability and abundance and confirm this bird's opportunistic behaviour. Between-colonies, differences in diet were significant, probably due to differences in habitat and prey species diversity and composition. The low consumption of valuable fish prey by Great Cormorant nestlings (<10%, numbers and biomass) suggests minimal competition with human interests.

We collected ecological data from a total 67 sites including water chemistry variables and regional landscape variables that have considerable effects on amphibian distributions. The proportion of site occupied by the Beysehir frog was 0.507, which is equivalent to almost half of the studied sites. The average detection probability was calculated as 0.48 +/- 0.102 over the year, whereas it was calculated as 0.75 +/- 0.090 during the breeding season. Temperature was positively correlated with detection probability. Maximum water depth, forest edge presence within 30 m of the water body, canopy presence surrounding the water body, submerged vegetation presence, vegetation cover rate of the water body, pH, dissolved O-2, chloride, and Mg hardness were statistically different in sites where the Beysehir frog is present and absent. Among the regional landscape variables potentially affecting the presence of the species, Logistic Regression Analysis showed positive relationships with canopy presence surrounding the water body and forest edge presence within 30 m of habitats. pH, in turn, was negatively related to the presence of P. caralitanus as an explanatory variable of water chemistry.																			1026-2296					SEP 26	2016	23	3					205	214																WOS:000388317300003

Herrings Alosa spp., Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, silversides Menidia spp., and yellow perch Perca flavescens dominated the diets of age-1 striped bass, while Atlantic menhaden dominated the diets of older striped bass. Selectivity was calculated for three categories of striped bass (ages 1, 2, and 3+ [3-7]) based on fish prey collections from a 61-m beach seine and a 76-m purse seine. Striped bass of all ages primarily consumed fish prey regardless of the month or year. Each age category of striped bass selected for one or more species of prey from the suborder Clupeoidei. Age-1 striped bass selectivity of Alosa spp. generally increased with the progression of each sampling season, whereas selectivity for Atlantic menhaden, Menidia spp., and yellow perch decreased over time within each season. Striped bass of all ages displayed strong selection for Atlantic menhaden and strong selection against spiny-rayed fish prey. Striped bass displayed selection for specific prey, although the mechanisms responsible for selection appear to vary through time and may differ for different prey types. Striped bass either displayed neutral size selectivity or selected for relatively small prey. The mean and maximum sizes of fish prey increased with increases in striped bass size, but the minimum prey size changed little. Our results of seasonal and age-specific changes in selectivity will be valuable for modeling the impact of striped bass predation on resource prey species.

J	Hillebrand, H; Kahlert, M				Hillebrand, H; Kahlert, M			Effect of grazing and water column nutrient supply on biomass and nutrient content of sediment microalgae	AQUATIC BOTANY												Field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of grazing and nutrient supply on sediment microflora in a freshwater habitat (Lake Erken, Sweden) and at the brackish Baltic Sea coast (Vaddo, Sweden). The two sites were of similar productivity, but had contrasting herbivore composition. In a full-factorial experiment design, closed cages excluded macrozoobenthos (>1 mm) from sediment patches, whereas open cages allowed grazer access. The cage design applied here proved to successfully prevent in- and epifauna to access the sediment in closed cages. In half of the treatments, nutrients were added to the water-column by a slow-release fertilizer. The experiments were seasonally replicated four times at Vaddo and two times in Lake Erken. After 4-5 weeks, sediment cores were sampled and analyzed for chlorophyll, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The benthic microalgae showed strong seasonal variation in biomass and internal nutrient content. At Vaddo, neither grazing nor nutrients affected the algal biomass significantly, but significant grazer effects were detected on C:N:P ratios. In Lake Erken, grazer presence reduced algal biomass by ca. 50%, whereas nutrients were without effect on biomass or on nutrient content. Compared to results from hard substrata at the same sites, sediment microflora was less affected by nutrients and grazing. This may be due to the harsh physico-chemical environment on sediments, to low grazer density at the coastal site and to low availability of water column nutrients to sediment microalgae. In our experiments, sand-dwelling microphytobenthic communities represented a highly dynamic assemblage, which, however, is less structured by biotic interactions than epilithic periphyton.

We provide two ways of using the sediment budget as an integrating device in the interpretation of mountain geomorphology. These approaches differ in their resolution and ability to budget the major components of the fine-sediment cascade in glaciated environments. Taken together, they provide an integrated index of landscape change over the Holocene. The first example compares the hydroclimatic controls of lake sedimentation for the last 600 years (A.D. 1370-1998) preserved in varved sediments from two of the lake basins. This hydroclimatological approach incorporates contemporary monitoring, air photo analysis, and detailed stratigraphy of sedimentation events within a single varve to infer the timing, sources, and preferred pathways of fine-grained sediments reaching the lake basins. The results indicate that glaciers, hillslope, and channel instability within the major subbasins are the principal sediment sources to the lake basins. Transitory sediment storage of glacially derived sediments within the channels is believed to modulate the episodic and more frequent delivery of sediments from adjacent hillslope and fluvial storage sites and direct routing of glacial rock flour during years of prolonged glacial melt. The second example, relying on the phosphorus geochemistry of sediments in an alpine lake basin, considers the evolution of phosphorus forms (from mineral to occluded and organic fractions) as a function of the soil development, inherent slope instability, and repeated cycles of glaciation and neoglaciation over the Holocene. This geochemical approach demonstrates that both neoglaciation and full glaciation have essentially zeroed the system in such a way that a high proportion of mineral phosphorus remains in the present lake sediments and the bioavailability of phosphorus (a key to ecosystem development) is low. Both examples illustrate the importance of variable sediment sources; the seasonality, frequency, and magnitude of sediment transfers; and the profound influence of ice cover over contemporary, neoglacial and Pleistocene time scales. They also signal the value of including both elastic and dissolved components in the sediment budget. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dodds, WK; Smith, VH; Zander, B				Dodds, WK; Smith, VH; Zander, B			Developing nutrient targets to control benthic chlorophyll levels in streams: A case study of the Clark Fork River	WATER RESEARCH												Approaches for assessing the effects of lowering nutrients on periphyton biomass in streams and rivers are poorly developed in contrast to those for lakes. Here we present two complementary approaches to assess target nutrient concentrations in streams, given desired mean and maximum standing crops of benthic algal chlorophyll. In the first approach. a reference portion or reach of the river that typically exhibits acceptable levels of benthic chlorophyll is identified (i.e. seasonal mean and maximum values do not exceed desirable levels), and the target levels for instream nutrient concentrations are defined by mean nutrient levels in the reference region. In the second approach, regression and graphical analyses of a large stream database are used to identify acceptable levels of instream total N and total P. The first approach supplies site-specific nutrient targets, whereas the second places nutrient control into a broader, more comparative perspective. In order to link these target concentrations to specific nutrient control measures, we describe a spreadsheet model that can be used to translate changes in external loading by point sources into predicted new instream nutrient concentrations. These quantitative methods are applied here to the control of nuisance algal growth in the Clark Fork River, Montana. We suggest that, in general, maintenance of mean instream total N concentrations below 350 mu g l(-1) and total P below 30 mu g l(-1) will result in mean benthic algal chlorophyll a density below nuisance levels of 100 mg m(-2) in most streams.

This study employed a quasianalytical algorithm (QAA) to retrieve water transparency (ZSD, in meters) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery over Bohai Bay (BHB), China. The spatiotemporal and seasonal distribution of coastal waters reflected the combined effects of natural effects and human activities. Random Forest and Partial least square-path modeling (PLS-PM) demonstrated the mechanisms and effects of each factor (natural effects, anthropogenic pressure, and policy management) through different pathways, with industrial emission and marine policies incorporated to support coastal NPS pollution control. The major findings were as follows: (1) Water transparency improved significantly by 52.4% during the lockdown period (2020-2022) compared to 2017-2019. This improvement continued into 2023 and revealed spatial heterogeneity in water quality responses. (2) Port transportation ranked highly in feature importance, as it continued operating under government support, whereas urban transportation was restricted by lockdown measures. (3) It revealed that natural effects exerted indirect regulation on NPS pollution when anthropogenic disturbances were suppressed. Industrial data and marine policies further suggested the effectiveness of government interventions in coastal environment management. Overall, this study quantified the impact of natural and human factors during lockdown management, providing valuable insights into the sources of coastal water pollution.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 1	2025	285								124043	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124043								40570494					WOS:001521821600001

Lake whitefish supports important commercial fisheries in Lake Huron and both species make use of habitats near the Bruce Nuclear Power Development, on the eastern shore of Lake Huron. Most fish of both species showed generalist feeding behavior, but some lake whitefish appeared to show specialist prey selection. The invasive spiny water flea Bythotrephes longimanus was an important component of the diet of both species. There was considerable dietary overlap between the whitefish species, but the ecological implications of these dietary overlaps are mitigated by the fact that dominant prey species differed in most seasons. We conclude that the potential for ecologically significant interactions between lake whitefish and round whitefish resulting from competition for similar benthic food resources in the main basin of Lake Huron is probably low [Current Zoology 56(1): 109-117, 2010].																			1674-5507	2396-9814				FEB	2010	56	1					109	117		10.1093/czoolo/56.1.109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.1.109													WOS:000277409400013
J	Steiner, CF				Steiner, CF			Daphnia dominance and zooplankton community structure in fishless ponds	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Predation by fish has commonly been viewed as a primary driver of spatial and seasonal variation in Daphnia dominance and the size structure of zooplankton communities. Yet, previous research suggests that large Daphnia do not always dominate in the absence of predation. As alternatives to the planktivory model, numerous mechanisms have been put forth, including the effect of resource competition and its interaction with resource quantity and quality and abiotic factors (e.g. temperature). Here results are presented of a field survey of 18 fishless, permanent ponds in southwest Michigan in which spatiotemporal variation in Daphnia pulex abundance and several potential determinants of this variation are explored. Results revealed a large amount of variation in D. pulex incidence and relative biomass, with some ponds exhibiting seasonal losses, some having few or no Daphnia, and some being dominated by D. pulex for the entire sample period. Redundancy analysis of zooplankton composition and pond environmental variables (biotic and abiotic) showed no relationship between D. pulex biomass and measures of Chaoborus abundance, algal resource production, or algal resource quality (including seston C:N:P). Instead, pH and temperature (both of which covaried) showed the strongest relationship with D. pulex biomass.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	2004	26	7					799	810		10.1093/plankt/fbh067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbh067													WOS:000222270800008

A binational effort to restore the lean morphotype of lake trout began with the stocking of hatchery-reared fish followed by the chemical control of sea lampreys and closure of the commercial fishery. Previous comparisons of the contemporary abundance of wild lean lake trout with that from historic commercial fishery statistics indicate that abundance was higher historically. However, this conclusion may be biased because several factors-the inclusion of siscowet (the "fat" morphotype of lake trout) in the catch statistics, the soak time of nets, seasonal effects on catch per effort, and the confounding effects of effort targeted at lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis-were not accounted for. We developed new indices of historic lean lake trout abundance that correct for these biases and compared them with the assessment data from 1984 to 1998 in Michigan waters of Lake Superior. The modern (1984-1998) abundance of wild lean lake trout is at least as high as that during 19291943 in six of eight management areas but lower in one area. Measures to promote and protect naturally reproducing populations have been more successful than previously realized.					; Wilberg, Michael/D-6289-2013	Hansen, Michael/0000-0001-8522-3876; Wilberg, Michael/0000-0001-8982-5946													0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2003	23	1					100	108		10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0100:HAMAOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0100:HAMAOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181587400009

During the developmental phase of the pump station, a need was identified to better understand the larval drift characteristics of these endangered catostomids in order to reduce entrainment into the irrigation system. The spatial, seasonal, and diel distribution of drifting larvae was measured during the 2004 spawning season at two proposed sites on the Williamson River where the pump station could be located. Larval drift for both species coincided with the irrigation season making them subject to entrainment into the irrigation system. Drift occurred almost exclusively at night with larvae entering the drift at sunset and exiting the drift at sunrise. Nighttime larval densities were concentrated near the surface and at midchannel at both sites. Densities were generally greater on the side of mid-channel with greater flow. During early morning sampling we detected a general shift in larval drift from surface to subsurface drift. We also observed an increase in larval densities towards the shore opposite from the proposed pump station at the upper site whereas larval densities remained high at midchannel at the lower site. During daytime sampling, the few larvae that were collected were distributed throughout the water column at both pump sites. This study found that larvae drifting during all time periods were generally distributed further across the cross section, deeper in the water column, and closer to where the proposed water withdrawal structure would be built at the downstream site when compared to the upstream site. Recommendations were provided to locate the withdrawal facility at the upstream site and operate it in a manner such that larval entrainment would likely be minimized.																			0378-1909					SEP	2010	89	1					47	57		10.1007/s10641-010-9688-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9688-8													WOS:000280781200006

In this study, we provide the first moderately high spatial resolution (17.6 x 17.6 km(2)) study of AOD over the Mojave Desert of southern California using satellite data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) for the period of March 2000 to October 2005. We have demonstrated the seasonality of AOD over the entire Mojave Desert, and the spatial and temporal variability of AOD from the average AOD at national parks, military installations, and dry lakes and playas. Statistically significant differences from the Mojave Desert mean AOD can be attributed to proximity to urban sources (e.g., Rogers Dry Lake is near the Los Angeles metropolitan area) and local sources (e.g., mineral extraction at Bristol Dry Lake). The western Mojave, generally around Rogers Dry Lake and Harper Dry Lake exhibited the most sustained pattern of seasonally high aerosol optical depths throughout the year. As a result, the AERONET site at Rogers Dry Lake should not be used as a site representative of the aerosol conditions over the entire Mojave Desert of southern California. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Patterson, RT; Kumar, A				Patterson, RT; Kumar, A			Assessment of arcellacean (thecamoebian) assemblages, species, and strains as contaminant indicators in James Lake, northeastern Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Conditions in James Lake vary from uncontaminated and nearly neutral pH conditions through most of the lake, to extremely low pH conditions (2.1 in places) contaminated with Fe, Al and SO, adjacent to an abandoned pyrite mine near the lake outlet. Six assemblages representative of distinct arcellacean habitats were recognized in sediment-water interface samples collected in the lake using Q-mode Cluster Analysis. R-Mode analysis of this distributional data corroborates previous results indicating that arcellacean strains from within the same species are useful for discriminating environments. Cucurbitella tricuspis dominates most samples and had to be deleted from analysis to determine benthic faunal relationships. This species is seasonally planktic and thus readily transported; it should not be considered in intralake studies. Arcella vulgaris overwhelmingly dominates extremely hostile low pH environments (<5.5) near the old mine site in samples where Shannon Diversity Index values of <1.000 are recorded. The highly variable pH in James Lake permitted the determination of precise boundary conditions for distribution of this species. These results indicate that Difflugia protaeiformis "claviformis" is an ideal indicator of industrial contamination under higher pH conditions. The D, protaeiformis "amphoralis" and "acuminata" strains are more closely linked to uncontaminated muddy substrates characterized by high proportions of diatoms, a probable important food source. The presence of Lesquerasia spiralis seems to be partially linked to substrate type with greater numbers typically found in coarser sediments.																			0096-1191					OCT	2000	30	4					310	320		10.2113/0300310	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/0300310													WOS:000165386400005
J	Armstrong, AW; Powers, L; Gonsior, M				Armstrong, Alec W.; Powers, Leanne; Gonsior, Michael			Reproducible determination of dissolved organic matter photosensitivity	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) connects aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, plays an important role in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, and supports aquatic food webs. Understanding DOM chemical composition and reactivity is key for predicting its ecological role, but characterization is difficult as natural DOM is comprised of a large but unknown number of distinct molecules. Photochemistry is one of the environmental processes responsible for changing the molecular composition of DOM, and DOM composition also defines its susceptibility to photochemical alteration. Reliably differentiating the photosensitivity of DOM from different sources can improve our knowledge of how DOM composition is shaped by photochemical alteration and aid research into photochemistry's role in various DOM transformation processes. Here we describe an approach for measuring and comparing DOM photosensitivity consistently, based on the kinetics of changes in DOM fluorescence during 20 h photodegradation experiments. We identify several methodological choices that affect photosensitivity measurements and offer guidelines for adopting our methods, including the use of reference material, precise control of conditions affecting photon dose, leveraging actinometry to estimate photon dose instead of expressing results as a function of exposure time, and frequent (every 20 min) fluorescence and absorbance measurements during exposure to artificial sunlight. We then show that our approach can generate photosensitivity metrics across several sources of DOM, including freshwater wetlands, a stream, an estuary, and Sargassum sp. leachate and observed differences in these metrics that may help identify or explain differences in their composition. Finally, we offer an example of applying our approach to compare DOM photosensitivity in two adjacent freshwater wetlands as seasonal hydrologic changes alter their DOM sources.

J	Schot, PP; Dekker, SC; Poot, A				Schot, PP; Dekker, SC; Poot, A			The dynamic form of rainwater lenses in drained fens	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Inflow of nutrient poor alkaline groundwater is generally seen as a prerequisite for the development of species rich fen vegetation. Drainage and groundwater abstraction may lead to the development of so-called rainwater lenses in the upper groundwater of fens, which prevent upward seeping alkaline groundwater from reaching the fen root zone. This threatens the conservation of the species rich vegetation. To provide insight in rainwater lens dynamics as a basis for conservation and restoration of fen biodiversity, numerical groundwater flow model simulations were performed for a hypothetical case area in the Netherlands. The simulations indicate that drainage canal surface water levels mainly affect the phreatic level in the fens, while groundwater inflow fluxes mainly affect the thickness of the rainwater lens. Increasing thickness of a semi-confining surface layer results in a rise in phreatic level. As the phreatic level reaches the soil surface, the rainwater lens may split in two as a result of groundwater discharge windows, which come into existence in the centre of the parcel. The effect of seasonal recharge fluctuations on the rainwater lens appears small. Spells of dry and wet years have a considerably larger effect especially on the lower boundary of the rainwater lens, resulting in thinner lenses during spells of dry years. Most simulations show rainwater lens thicknesses well exceeding rooting depths of fen plants. This is inconsistent with the fact that fen vegetation is found in nature reserves for which the simulations are considered representative. Chemical buffer processes in the soil may explain this inconsistency, masking an acidification process under way. As buffer capacities become exhausted over time, acidification and fen deterioration will occur at a certain future moment. To arrive at more definite conclusions about this hypothesis, our simulations of convective groundwater flow need to be supplemented by modelling of hydrochemical processes in rainwater lenses, followed by verification at actual field locations.

J	Horppila, J; Liljendahl-Nurminen, A				Horppila, J; Liljendahl-Nurminen, A			Clay-turbid interactions may not cascade - A reminder for lake managers	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Food web management is a frequently used lake restoration method, which aims to reduce phytoplankton biomass by strengthening herbivorous zooplankton through reduction of planktivorous fish. However, in clay-turbid lakes several factors may reduce the effectivity of food web management. Increasing turbidity reduces the effectivity of fish predation and weakens the link between zooplankton and phytoplankton. Therefore, the effects of fish stock manipulations may not cascade to lower trophic levels as expected. Additionally, in clay-turbid conditions invertebrate predators may coexist in high densities with planktivorous fish and negate the effects of fish reductions. For instance, in the stratifying regions of the clay-turbid Lake Hiidenvesi, Chaoborus flavicans is the main regulator of cladocerans and occupies the water column throughout the day, although planktivorous Osmerus eperlanus is very abundant. The coexistence of chaoborids and fish is facilitated by a metalimnetic turbidity peak, which prevents efficient predation by fish. In the shallow parts of the lake, chaoborids are absent despite high water turbidity. We suggest that, generally, the importance of invertebrate predators in relation to vertebrate predators may change along turbidity and depth gradients. The importance of fish predation is highest in shallow waters with low turbidity. When water depth increases, the importance of fish in the top-down regulation of zooplankton declines, whereas that of chaoborids increases, the change along the depth gradient being moderate in clear-water lakes and steep in highly turbid lakes. Thus, especially deep clay-turbid lakes may be problematic for implementing food web management as a restoration tool.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				JUN	2005	13	2					242	246		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00031.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00031.x													WOS:000229180600002

The experiments were conducted over a 2-year period, and during that time, water table depth of drained plots was maintained on average 7 cm lower than the ambient water table, and surface temperatures of plots exposed to elevated temperature were increased on average 0.5 degrees C. Water table drainage, and to a lesser extent elevated temperature, resulted in significant increases in ecosystem respiration (ER) rates, and only small and variable changes in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP). As a result, drained plots were net sources of approximate to 40 gC m(-2) season(-1) over both years of manipulation, while control plots were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 of about 10 gC m(-2) season(-1) (growing season length was an estimated 125 days). Control plots exposed to elevated temperatures accumulated slightly more carbon than control plots exposed to ambient temperatures. The direct effects of elevated temperature on net CO2 flux, ER, and GEP were small, however, elevated temperature appeared to interact with drainage to exacerbate the amount of net carbon loss. These data suggest that many currently saturated or nearly saturated wet sedge ecosystems of the north slope of Alaska may become significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere if climate change predictions of increased evapotranspiration and reduced soil water status are realized. There is ample evidence that this may be already occurring in arctic Alaska, as a change in net carbon balance has been observed for both tussock and wet-sedge tundra ecosystems over the last 2-3 decades, which coincides with a recent increase in surface temperature and an associated decrease in soil water content. In contrast, if precipitation increases relatively more than evapotranspiration, then increases in soil moisture content will likely result in greater carbon accumulation.

J	Bunnell, DB; Hale, RS; Vanni, MJ; Stein, RA				Bunnell, DB; Hale, RS; Vanni, MJ; Stein, RA			Predicting crappie recruitment in Ohio reservoirs with spawning stock size, larval density, and chlorophyll concentrations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Stock-recruit models typically use only spawning stock size as a predictor of recruitment to a fishery. In this paper, however, we used spawning stock size as well as larval density and key environmental variables to predict recruitment of white crappies Pomoxis annularis and black crappies P. nigromaculatus, a genus notorious for variable recruitment. We sampled adults and recruits from 11 Ohio reservoirs and larvae from 9 reservoirs during 1998-2001. We sampled chlorophyll as an index of reservoir productivity and obtained daily estimates of water elevation to determine the impact of hydrology on recruitment. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruit models that included chlorophyll best explained the variation in larval density and age-2 recruits. Specifically, spawning stock catch per effort (CPE) and chlorophyll explained 63-64% of the variation in larval density. In turn, larval density and chlorophyll explained 43-49% of the variation in age-2 recruit CPE. Finally, spawning stock CPE and chlorophyll were the best predictors of recruit CPE (i.e., 74-86%). Although larval density and recruitment increased with chlorophyll, neither was related to seasonal water elevation. Also, the AIC generally did not distinguish between Ricker and Beverton-Holt models. From these relationships, we concluded that crappie recruitment can be limited by spawning stock CPE and larval production when spawning stock sizes are low (i.e., CPE < 5 crappies/net-night). At higher levels of spawning stock sizes, spawning stock CPE and recruitment were less clearly related. To predict recruitment in Ohio reservoirs, managers should assess spawning stock CPE with trap nets and estimate chlorophyll concentrations. To increase crappie recruitment in reservoirs where recruitment is consistently poor, managers should use regulations to increase spawning stock size, which, in turn, should increase larval production and recruits to the fishery.

As a solution, sources of fecal pollution in waters must be accurately assessed, properly determined and strictly controlled. However, the exercise has remained challenging due to the existing overlapping characteristics by different members of faecal coliform bacteria and the inadequacy of information pertaining to the contribution of seasonality and weather condition on tracking the possible sources of pollution. There are continued efforts to improve the Faecal Contamination Source Tracking (FCST) techniques such as Microbial Source Tracking (MST). This study aimed to make contribution to MST by evaluating the efficacy of combining site specific quantification of faecal contamination indicator bacteria and detection of DNA markers while accounting for seasonality and weather conditions' effects in tracking the major sources of faecal contamination in a freshwater system (Donghu Lake, China). The results showed that the use of cyd gene in addition to lacZ and uidA genes differentiates E. coli from other closely related faecal bacteria. The use of selective media increases the pollution source tracking accuracy. BSA addition boosts PCR detection and increases FCST efficiency. Seasonality and weather variability also influence the detection limit for DNA markers.

J	McCartney, MA; Mallez, S				Mccartney, Michael A.; Mallez, Sophie			The role of waterway connections and downstream drift of veliger larvae in the expanding invasion of inland lakes by zebra mussels in Minnesota, USA	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussel spread to inland waters in Europe and North America is often attributed to overland transport by trailered boats and water-related equipment Much less attention is paid to spread between lakes connected by streams that may serve as conduits for larval dispersal. Previous studies have produced few data on the magnitude and distance of downstream drift of veliger larvae. Here we present an evaluation of the contribution of streamflow connections to zebra mussel spread, and new data on the numbers of larvae transported from infested lake stream outlets. We studied lake/stream connections in Minnesota (MN) and found that lakes connected to upstream infested lakes are 27 times more often infested than unconnected lakes. In 4 lake/stream systems and at increasing distances downstream of infested source lakes, we estimated recruitment and larval "flux" (numbers per unit time), and found recruitment to be localized, in most cases to within 1 km from source lakes. A short distance from lake outlets, larval flux reached 10(9) larvae per day or more at peak times in the 2 systems with the highest supply. In all 4 systems, flux dropped steeply and exponentially with distance. Nevertheless, flux reached 0 (observed) through the entire season, and/or was below a low-risk threshold (estimated) at the downstream inlet (as far as 64 km downstream) in only 1 system. Spread risk by downstream drift is so high that prevention and treatment efforts should be focused on upstream lakes in pristine watersheds. At the same time, localized recruitment confirms that zebra mussel populations are unlikely to persist far from source waters, limiting impact to unionids and other native species in small streams.

J	von Brömssen, C; Fölster, J; Futter, M; McEwan, K				von Bromssen, Claudia; Folster, Jens; Futter, Martyn; McEwan, Kerstin			Statistical models for evaluating suspected artefacts in long-term environmental monitoring data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Long-term water quality monitoring is of high value for environmental management as well as for research. Artificial level shifts in time series due to method improvements, flaws in laboratory practices or changes in laboratory are a common limitation for analysis, which, however, are often ignored. Statistical estimation of such artefacts is complicated by the simultaneous existence of trends, seasonal variation and effects of other influencing factors, such as weather conditions. Here, we investigate the performance of generalised additive mixed models (GAMM) to simultaneously identify one or more artefacts associated with artificial level shifts, longitudinal effects related to temporal trends and seasonal variation, as well as to model the serial correlation structure of the data. In the same model, it is possible to estimate separate residual variances for different periods so as to identify if artefacts not only influence the mean level but also the dispersion of a series. Even with an appropriate statistical methodology, it is difficult to quantify artificial level shifts and make appropriate adjustments to the time series. The underlying temporal structure of the series is especially important. As long as there is no prominent underlying trend in the series, the shift estimates are rather stable and show less variation. If an artificial shift occurs during a slower downward or upward tendency, it is difficult to separate these two effects and shift estimates can be both biased and have large variation. In the case of a change in method or laboratory, we show that conducting the analyses with both methods in parallel strongly improves estimates of artefact effects on the time series, even if certain problems remain. Due to the difficulties of estimating artificial level shifts, posterior adjustment is problematic and can lead to time series that no longer can be used for trend analysis or other analysis based on the longitudinal structure of the series. Before carrying out a change in analytic method or laboratory, it should be considered if this is absolutely necessary. If changes cannot be avoided, the analysis of the two methods considered, or the two laboratories contracted, should be run in parallel for a considerable period of time so as to enable a good assessment of changes introduced to the data series.					; von Brömssen, Claudia/AAX-6300-2020; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011	Folster, Jens/0000-0002-3069-4272; von Bromssen, Claudia/0000-0002-1452-8696; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2018	190	9							558	10.1007/s10661-018-6900-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6900-3								30159677					WOS:000443215500005

All the hydrographical parameters such as sea surface temperature, salinity, pH, total alkalinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients like nitrate, nitrite, inorganic phosphate and reactive silicate, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton assemblages were studied for a period of five months (May, August, September 2010, March and November 2011). Over 121 species of phytoplankton represented by 93 species of diatoms, 16 species of dinoflagellates, 9 species of blue-green algae, 2 species of greens and 1 species of silicoflagellate were recorded. High phytoplankton species diversity was found in March 2011 when salinity and nitrate concentrations were low and reactive silicate and inorganic phosphates were moderate. Species diversity was low during May 2010 when increased sea surface temperature, salinity and low nutrients availability were observed. Coscinodiscus centralis, Diatoma vulgaris and Proboscia alata were dominant, especially Coscinodiscus sp. distributed in all stations whereas Skeletonema costatum, Odontella sinensis and Ditylum brightwellii were abundant in August and September 2010. From principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis, it is evident that variables like sea surface temperature and dissolved oxygen are the most important factors influencing the seasonal pattern of phytoplankton population.

Variation in the mobilization of mercury into Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus chicks in coastal saltpans, as revealed by stable isotopes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Causes of variation in mobilization of mercury into Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus chicks were studied through analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. Blood and breast feathers were collected from chicks in coastal saltpans during successive breeding seasons. Detritus samples and potential prey (macroinvertebrates) were also collected. Total mercury concentrations and stable isotope signatures were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy and isotope ratio mass spectrometry respectively. Mercury levels in Chironomidae, Corixidae and Hydrophilidae correlated with mercury levels in chick feathers. Differences of delta N-15 signatures between macroinvertebrate groups indicated that they belong to different trophic levels. delta N-15 signatures of invertebrates correlated with mercury levels in invertebrates and chicks, but not with delta N-15 signatures in chicks. Between-group and between-site differences of delta N-15 signatures and mercury levels in invertebrates suggested that they contribute differently to mercury mobilization into chicks, and their relative contribution depends on prey availability in each site. Inter-site differences in the biomagnification factor reinforced that idea. delta C-13 signatures in invertebrates marked a larger range of carbon sources than just detritus. Variation of water inflow regime and prey availability may cause between-group and between-site differences of delta C-13 signatures in prey. Discrepancies between feather and blood for delta C-13 signatures in Praias-Sado and Vaia suggested that temporal variation of prey availability may be the main factor affecting mercury mobilization into chicks in both those cases, since their water inflow regimes are the same. The lowest levels of delta C-13 signatures in Vau suggested that water inflow regime may be the main factor in this case, since no discrepancy existed in delta C-13 signatures between blood and feather.

J	McHale, MR; Mitchell, MJ; McDonnell, JJ; Cirmo, CP				McHale, MR; Mitchell, MJ; McDonnell, JJ; Cirmo, CP			Nitrogen solutes in an Adirondack forested watershed: Importance of dissolved organic nitrogen	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen (N) dynamics were evaluated from 1 June 1995 through 31 May 1996 within the Arbutus Lake watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, USA. At the Arbutus Lake outlet dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NO3- and NH4+ contributed 61%, 33%, and 6% respectively, to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) flux (259 mol ha(-1) yr(-1)). At the lake inlet DON, NO3- and NH4+ constituted 36%, 61%, and 3% respectively, of TDN flux (349 mol ha(-1) yr(-1)). Differences between the factors that control DON, NO3-, and NH4+ stream water concentrations were evaluated using two methods for estimating annual N flux at the lake inlet. Using biweekly sampling NO3- and NH4+ flux was 10 and 4 mol ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively, less than flux estimates using biweekly plus storm and snowmelt sampling. DON flux was 18 mol ha(-1) yr(-1) greater using only biweekly sampling. These differences are probably not of ecological significance relative to the total flux of N from the watershed (349 mol ha(-1) yr(-1)). Dissolved organic N concentrations were positively related to discharge during both the dormant (R-2 = 0.31; P < 0.01) and growing season (R-2 = 0.09; P < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between NO3- concentration and discharge during the dormant season, but a significant negative relationship was found during the growing season (R-2 = 0.29; P < 0.01). Biotic controls in the growing season appeared to have had a larger impact on stream water NO3- concentrations than on DON concentrations.

J	Alley, NF				Alley, NF			Cainozoic stratigraphy, palaeoenvironments and geological evolution of the Lake Eyre Basin	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												For a large part of inland Australia weathering and erosion prevailed from the Cenomanian to the Late Paleocene. Subsidence commencing in the Late Paleocene produced a depocentre, the Lake Eyre Basin, in which sedimentation occurred in three main phases: (I) fluviolacustrine sand, silt, clay and carbonaceous horizons from latest Paleocene to Middle Eocene; (2) dolomite and magnesium-rich clay and sand deposited in extensive shallow, alkaline lakes from ?latest Oligocene-Miocene; and (3) red clay, silt and sand were deposited in fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian settings during the Pliocene and Quaternary. Widespread weathering and silicification of sediments occurred in the Late Eocene-Oligocene and again in the Pliocene, the latter also accompanied by ferruginisation. The silcrete sheets were folded into broad domes during the Oligocene and again in the Pliocene, when faulting marginal to the southern ranges also occurred. From the Late Paleocene to Early Eocene the basin supported rainforest growing in megathermal to mesothermal conditions. By the Middle Eocene vegetation had changed to localised riparian forest in valley bottoms and more open sclerophyllous woodland in the hinterland, indicating monsoonal conditions. For most of this early Tertiary interval deposition was by broad braidstreams flowing northwards. In the Miocene, scattered elements of megathermal forest still existed, but open woodland was far more extensive. Strong climatic seasonality and elevated temperatures promoted the deposition of thick dolomites in giant alkaline lakes. The lakes and the diverse vegetation were home to a rich aquatic and terrestrial fauna. By the Pliocene, climate was semiarid and vegetation mainly open Casuarinaceae-dominated woodland with very rare stands of forest confined to edaphically suitable sites. Increasing aridity during the Quaternary was punctuated by pluvial intervals. Vast lakes formed during the interglacials largely as a result of higher rainfall in Queensland. Drier, windier conditions during the glacials, particularly the last, led to the development of extensive dunefields. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Williams, MW; Baron, JS; Caine, N; Sommerfeld, R; Sanford, R				Williams, MW; Baron, JS; Caine, N; Sommerfeld, R; Sanford, R			Nitrogen saturation in the Rocky Mountains	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nitrogen saturation is occurring throughout high-elevation catchments of the Colorado Front Range. Annual inorganic N loading in wet deposition to the Front Range of similar to 4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) is about twice that of the Pacific States and similar to many sites in the northeastern United States. In the last ten years at Niwot Ridge/Green Lakes Valley and Glacier Lakes, annual minimum concentrations of NO3- in surface waters during the growing season have increased from below detection limits to similar to 10 mu equiv L(-1), indicating that these two catchments are at the threshold of N saturation. The Loch Vale watershed is N saturated, with annual minimum concentrations of NO3- in surface waters generally above 10 mu equiv L(-1); annual volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of 16 mu equiv L(-1) in surface waters are greater than that of similar to 11 mu equiv L(-1) NO3- in wet deposition. At these high-elevation catchments, there has been a shift in ecosystem dynamics from an N-iimited system to an N-saturated system as a result of anthropogenically fixed N in wetfall and dryfall. Results from the Western Lakes Survey component of the National Surface Water Survey show that N saturation is a regional problem in the Colorado Front Range, with many lakes having (NO3-) concentrations greater than 10 mu equiv L(-1). Foliar N:P ratios in bristlecone pine increase with elevation in the Colorado Front Range, indicating that at higher elevations P is translocated from foliar tissue more efficiently than N and that increasing atmospheric deposition of N with elevation is causing a change from N limitation to P limitation in the highest-elevation bristlecone pines. Current concepts of critical loads need to be reconsidered since only modest atmospheric loadings of N are sufficient to induce N leaching to surface waters in high-elevation catchments of the western United States.

Environmental controls on long-term growth of freshwater mussels in an oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater mussels are one of the most endangered groups of animals and live in some of the fastest changing ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, very little is known about how their life history and ecology are influenced by their environment, especially for lake-dwelling populations. In this study, we paired similar to 30 y of extensive environmental data to lifetime and annual growth rates of a population of Fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea) living in a cool-water oligotrophic lake in northern Wisconsin, USA. This population displayed one of the slowest growth rates and longest lifespans within its phylogenetic tribe (Lampsilini). Growth rates were highly variable between individuals and, in contrast to studies in other systems, not related to temperature, growing season, or any indicators of primary production. However, growth rates were positively correlated with changes in lake level. We hypothesize that mussel growth in this system is linked to landscape-level environmental conditions and allochthonous resource limitation.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN 1	2021	40	2					316	327		10.1086/714596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714596		JUN 2021											WOS:000644567700002

Stable Isotopes Reveal Variation in Consumption of Pacific Salmon by Brown Bears, Despite Ready Access in Small Streams	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Brown bears Ursus arctos consume a wide range of organisms, including ungulates and plants, but Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are especially important to their diet where their ranges overlap. Although some brown bears minimize antagonistic encounters with other brown bears or infanticide by avoiding streams where salmon spawn, studies generally assume that brown bears with ready access to salmon feed heavily on them. To test this assumption, and the hypothesis that male brown bears would feed more heavily on salmon than females (owing to their sexual size dimorphism), we collected hair samples from brown bears by using barbed wire placed on six small tributaries of Lake Aleknagik, Alaska, USA, where adult Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are readily accessible and frequently consumed by brown bears. Analysis of DNA distinguished among the different brown bears leaving the hair samples, some of which were sampled multiple times within and among years. We assessed the contribution of salmon to the diet of individual brown bears by using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures. The 77 samples analyzed from 31 different bears over 4 y showed isotopic ratios consistent with reliance on salmon, but the wide range of isotopic signatures included values suggesting variable, and in one case considerable, use of terrestrial resources. Stable isotope signatures did not differ between male and female brown bears, nor did they differ between two sides of the lake, despite marked differences in Sockeye Salmon density. We collected the hair samples when salmon were present, so there was some uncertainty regarding whether they reflected feeding during the current or previous season. Notwithstanding this caveat, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that salmon were sufficiently available to provide food for the brown bears and that the considerable isotopic variation among brown bears with access to salmon reflected their age, status, and behavior.

The spatial diversity of the environment was considered when collecting diatoms and water samples in three distinct parts of the fishpond, where automatic sensor stations continually measuring basic factors were established. Macrophytes were mapped in 30 segments of the fishpond littoral altogether. High species richness and spatiotemporal variability were found in assemblages of these groups of autotrophs. Water level fluctuations, caused by the interaction of fish farming management and climatic extremes, were identified as one of the most important factors shaping the structure and species composition of diatom and macrophyte assemblages. The distance of the sampling sites from large inflows reflected well the spatial variability within the fishpond, with important differences in duration of bottom drainage and exposure to disturbances in different parts of the fishpond. Disturbances caused by intensive wave action are most probably a crucial factor allowing the coexistence of species with different nutrient requirements under the hypertrophic conditions of the Dehtar fishpond. Due to a range of variables tested and climatic extremes encountered, our study may be considered as a basis for predictive model constructions in similar hypertrophic water bodies under a progressing climate change.

In situ snow measurements of water equivalent, depth and density collected from field surveys during 1996-2004 snow seasons were collocated with gridded SSM/I brightness temperatures. Sub-grid lake fraction was computed from a high-resolution land cover map derived from LANDSAT imagery. Another dataset was created consisting of multi-year time series of SSM/I and AMSR-E brightness temperatures and computed lake fraction. Consistent with other studies, it was found that lake fraction was negatively correlated with in situ snow depth and snow water equivalent and positively correlated with snow density, which indicates that lakes have a direct effect on snow cover distribution: They accumulate less but denser snow than surrounding land areas. Additionally, lake fraction was positively correlated with the brightness temperature measurements at 18 GHz and above, but negatively correlated with the AMSR-E brightness temperatures at low frequency channels (6 and 10 GHz), with the highest correlation values for the SSM/I (r = 0.57) and AMSR-E (r = 0.65) at 37 GHz dominating the response. Brightness temperature-based lake fraction algorithms were derived using stepwise regression. Performance assessment showed that the AMSR-E algorithm was superior to the SSM/I algorithm due to the use of the low frequency measurements not available from the SSM/I instrument. Combined lake fraction- and SSM/I brightness temperature-based snow depth and snow water equivalent algorithms were also derived using stepwise regression, with improved performance compared to conventional brightness temperature-based algorithms.

Responses to tuberculin among Zebu cattle in the transhumance regions of Karamoja and Nakasongola district of Uganda	TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION												Responses to tuberculin in Zebu cattle of the transhumant pastoral farming system in Karamoja region and Nakasongola district in the north-eastern. and mid-central regions in Uganda, respectively, were investigated using a comparative intradermal tuberculin skin test. Of the 1864 cattle tested from 30 large units (superherds) in Karamoja and 7 herds in Nakasongola, a total of 28 animals from 19 herds (51.4%) tested positive. Inter-district tuberculin reactor prevalence variations seemed to be influenced by climate, with impact on both the management patterns and transmissibility of agent. High herd tuberculin reactor prevalence (51.4%) was attributed to widespread contacts and mixing of animals between herds. Low individual animal tuberculin test positivity (mean=1.4%) was attributed to low transmissibility of the agent under the Karamoja climate, which is semi-arid, and to increased resistance due to non-specific response to environmental mycobacteria and natural selection, since there was no active control against bovine tuberculosis. Owing to similarities in management practices in Karamoja and widespread risk factors, it was difficult to identify which were more important, but variations in sources of drinking water pointed to provision of lake and borehole water during dry season as reducing the risk. Positive bovine tuberculin reactor prevalence and skin reactor status were related to age.

J	Bérard, A; Benninghoff, C				Bérard, A; Benninghoff, C			Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) and seasonal variations in the sensitivity of phytoplankton to atrazine in nanocosms	CHEMOSPHERE												Algae communities exposed to a herbicide like atrazine (PS U inhibitor) are expected to be selected and to be more tolerant to the herbicide than unexposed communities (pollution-induced community tolerance, PICT). The PICT may be an eco toxicological tool for detecting this selective action of chronic pollution, and this method has been applied to several toxicants in experimental systems and in field studies. But the detection of PICT with PS II inhibitors has sometimes been variable. This work was done to study the long-term effects of exposure to atrazine (10 mug/l) and the PICT responses of phytoplankton communities in repeated outdoor nanocosms. Phytoplankton communities were sampled in Lake Geneva at different periods of the year and the effects of atrazine were analysed by studying community structure, biomass and primary production, and by measuring tolerance to atrazine in a short-term physiological test based on C-14 incorporation. We find that PICT is a sensitive method for measuring effects. Even atrazine concentrations causing little restructuring induced tolerance in most of our experiments. But the short- and long-term responses of phytoplankton to atrazine varied between experiments, probably due to the initial compositions of the communities and environmental factors associated with seasonal parameters. The selection and detection steps of PICT to atrazine thus vary greatly with environmental conditions and the physiological adaptations of algae to the herbicide. To monitor risk assessment in aquatic systems, PICT studies applied to algae, must be investigated in the light of seasonal contaminations and seasonal events and successions.

J	Vrede, K; Stensdotter, U; Lindström, ES				Vrede, K; Stensdotter, U; Lindström, ES			Viral and bacterioplankton dynamics in two lakes with different humic contents	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Viral and bacterioplankton dynamics were investigated, together with the temporal variation of phage-infected bacterioplankton in two oligotrophic lakes, one humic and the other clearwater. Bacterial abundance was significantly higher in the humic lake, while the abundance of virus-like particles (VLP) was significantly higher in the clearwater lake. There were no differences in either the frequency of infected bacterial cells (FIC), or in burst size between the lakes. Because of the higher bacterial abundance in the humic lake, a larger number of bacteria were lyzed in this lake. FIC showed large seasonal changes, varying between 9 and 43%, which covers almost the entire range of previously published data from both lacustrine and marine environments. The temporal changes in VLP abundance and FIC were slow in both the humic and clearwater lakes. The burst size was low in both lakes (average value, nine in each case), probably because of the oligotrophic status of the lakes. The chlorophyll a concentrations were higher and positively correlated with VLP numbers in the clearwater lake, indicating that a significant proportion of the viruses in this lake may be phytoplankton viruses.

Assessment of nutrient enrichment and heavy metal pollution of headwater streams of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The continuing degradation of riverine ecosystems by the discharge of poorly treated and untreated urbanwastewater (together referred to as partly treated urban-wastewater in this study) is a major problem in developing countries. This study assessed water and sediment quality of headwater streams radiating from the Bulawayo area including Umguza and Khami Rivers that drain wastewater from the City. Seventeen study sites were a priori selected from different land use types: City sites (5 sites), downstream communal sites (4), upstream communal sites (3) and for reference five sites were selected upstream of the City within the buffer zones of protected areas. Water and sediment samples were collected during the hot-wet, cold-dry and hot-dry seasons from these site categories and were analysed for selected physicochemical water parameters and heavy metals. The City sites were the most degraded as indicated by significantly highest levels of dissolved oxygen deficiency, embeddedness by particulates, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The City sites were also salinised. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that urban-wastewater was the major factor explaining the dissimilarity of the studied site clusters and the results also suggested that the sources of heavy metals in the study area were diffuse. Degradation of studied sites by urban-wastewater signifies negative health risks to biodiversity and humans particularly the downstream rural communities. Therefore, priority must be on interventions to ensure improvement of the quality of urban-wastewater discharged from City of Bulawayo to the environment.

Combined electrical resistivity tomography and magnetic resonance sounding investigation of the surface-water/groundwater interaction in the Urema Graben, Mozambique	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												This study focusses on the hydrogeology of Urema Graben, especially possible interactions between surface water and groundwater around Lake Urema, in Gorongosa National Park (GNP). Lake Urema is the only permanent water source for wildlife inside GNP, and there are concerns that it will disappear due to interferences in surface-water/groundwater interactions as a result of changes in the hydraulic environment. As the lake is the only permanent water source, this would be a disaster for the ecosystem of the park. The subsurface geology in Urema Graben was investigated by 20 km of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and three magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) surveys. The average depth penetration was 60 and 100 m, respectively. The location of the ERT lines was decided based on general rift morphology and therefore orientated perpendicular to Urema Graben, from the transitional areas of the margins of the Barue platform in the west to the Cheringoma plateau escarpments in the east. ERT andMRS both indicate a second aquifer, where Urema Lake is a window of the first upper semi-confined aquifer, while the lower aquifer is confined by a clay layer 30-40 m thick. The location and depth of this aquifer suggest that it is probably linked to the Pungwe River which could be a main source of recharge during the dry season. If a dam or any other infrastructure is constructed in Pungwe River upstream of GNP, the groundwater level will decrease which could lead to drying out of Urema Lake.

J	Rohling, EJ				Rohling, Eelco J.			Of lakes and fields: A framework for reconciling palaeoclimatic drought inferences with archaeological impacts	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Quantitative estimates of climate variability are increasingly important in interpretations of archaeological turnovers in arid regions. Variations in lake levels or lake-water oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) are often used to infer droughts or humid periods, along with speleothem delta O-18, pollen, and windblown dust records. Key examples are the centennial-scale Holocene events associated with the end of the Bronze Age (similar to 1200 BCE), the end of the Copper Age (similar to 4000 BCE), and the onset of Neolithic expansion (similar to 6200 BCE). Whether explicitly stated or only implied, causality between archaeological turnovers and inferred droughts is often ascribed to a disturbance to food resources, which means a disturbance to the agricultural potential of the study region. In the present study, a simple framework of equations is presented for evaluation of this causality. It quantitatively reveals significant complications. In one example, substantially improved crop-growing potential is found to coincide with dropping lake levels, which reflect significant net drought. The complications mainly arise from: (1) control of annually averaged climate conditions on lake changes versus control of seasonal conditions on the yield potential of fields; and (2) changes in the ratios between the overall catchment area of a lake or field, and the surface area of the lake or field itself. The results demonstrate that lake records per se do not satisfactorily reflect agricultural potential, but also that this gap may be bridged with targeted information collection about the regional setting. In particular, improved results may be obtained from detailed assessments of change in the catchment ratios of the lake(s) and field(s) that are being studied (e.g., using digital elevation models), along with expert opinions on field irrigation potential. The scenarios presented here then allow initial field-based assessments and hypothesis formulation to prompt more sophisticated modelling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dimuthu Nilmini			Application of pollution indices to quantify the pollution status of shallow sediments of the Bolgoda Lake, Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												The present study was conducted to assess the pollution status of the shallow sediments of the Bolgoda Lake in Sri Lanka using sediment pollution indices. Shallow sediment samples were collected as replicates from five sites with different land uses in the monsoonal and non monsoonal seasons in 2013. The samples were acid digested and analysed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Fe and Zn. The heavy metal concentrations were used to calculate: (1) contamination factor (C-f'); (2) degree of contamination (C-d); (3) pollution loading index (PLI); (4) enrichment ratio (ER); (5) geoaccumulation index (i(geo)) and (6) ecological risk factor (E-r') of the shallow sediment samples. In addition, the quality of the sediments were also assessed by comparing with the numerical sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (CBSQGs). Significant spatial variations of element concentrations and sediment quality indices were identified in the study area. The pollution level of the study sites ranged from unpolluted to heavily polluted due to heavy metals. The contamination factors for all the heavy metals except Zn indicated moderate, considerable or very high level of pollution in both sampling sessions. The potential ecological risk factor for the heavy metals ranked as Cd > Ni > Cr > Cu > Zn for both sampling sessions indicating the highest potential ecological risk from Cd. The pollution load index for all the study sites except site E in both sampling sessions showed human associated pollution with a PLI higher than 1. All the samples were categorised into class 1 (unpolluted to moderately polluted status) with respect to Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn and to class 0 (unpolluted status) with respect to Cd. The concentrations of Zn and Cd in the present study were lower than the threshold effect concentration (TEC) level of CBSQGs and therefore, was indicated as unlikely to be causing toxicity to benthic organisms. The concentrations of Cr and Ni were higher than the probable effect concentration (PEC) level of CBSQGs and indicated a probable toxicity to benthic organisms.																			1391-4588	2362-0161				SEP	2016	44	3					279	289		10.4038/jnsfsr.v44i3.8010	http://dx.doi.org/10.4038/jnsfsr.v44i3.8010													WOS:000384631100007

Hydro-chemical characterization and quality assessment of a Western Himalayan river, Munawar Tawi, flowing through Rajouri district, Jammu and Kashmir, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Studies on river water quality in the Indian Himalayas are limited to a few larger ones; the smaller ones, although vital for a large section of people, mostly remain untouched. Therefore, Munawar Tawi a tributary of Chenab flowing through Rajouri district of Jammu region, Western Himalayas was selected for the study. Fifty-four water samples from 27 sites from Rajouri town and its upstream and downstream locations were collected during January and June 2014. Fourteen water quality parameters that include major cations and anions were analyzed. Water quality indicators such as SAR, % Na, RSC, MAR, KI, and PI were also calculated to determine suitability of water for irrigation. Piper plots identified four water types, of which Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- was the dominant type in both the seasons. While in January, water samples varied across all the four types, in June only two types were seen (i.e. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- and Ca2+-Mg2+-Na+-HCO3-). LudwigLangelier plot also showed Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- type as the dominant water type. Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed most of the parameters, except TDS, significantly high in January than in June.

J	Schallenberg, M; Burns, CW				Schallenberg, M; Burns, CW			A temperate, tidal lake-wetland complex - 2. Water quality and implications for zooplankton community structure	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lakes Waihola and Waipori are shallow, coastal, tidal lakes that experience wind-induced sediment resuspension, saline intrusions, and high inputs of nutrients. To determine the influence of externally-driven, physical factors on spatial and temporal patterns of water quality in the two lakes, meteorological, hydrological, and water quality data were collected over 1 year. Multivariate analyses indicated that wind energy was driving the main water quality gradient in the lakes, which was primarily related to wind-induced resuspension of lake sediments. The major, seasonally regulated, nontidal freshwater inflow was important in determining nutrient and salinity gradients in the lakes. The main nutrient inputs to the system were identified as the regulated, non-tidal inflow (the upper Waipori River) and the tidal inflow (lower Waipori River). The impact of water quality gradients on zooplankton community structure in the lakes was assessed by canonical multivariate methods. Salinity gradients, caused by seasonal saltwater intrusions, were strongly related to zooplankton community structure in the lakes. Nutrient gradients (indicative of trophic state) were also related to zooplankton community structure. Although wind-induced sediment resuspension had the largest impact on water quality in the lakes, it had little impact on the zooplankton community structure in either lake. The relationships between water quality and zooplankton community structure were confounded in Lake Waipori because of its very short hydraulic residence time (annual mean = 1.9 days). Zooplankton community structure was resilient to short-term changes in suspended particulate matter concentrations but not to seasonal changes in salinity. The results of this study support others which have shown impacts of even relatively small variations in salinity on the structure of zooplankton communities. This highlights the vulnerability of zooplankton communities in coastal lakes and wetlands to increasing salinity resulting from sea level rise and global climate change.																			0028-8330					JUN	2003	37	2					429	447		10.1080/00288330.2003.9517178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2003.9517178													WOS:000184766500019
J	Winter, TC; Rosenberry, DO; Buso, DC; Merk, DA				Winter, TC; Rosenberry, DO; Buso, DC; Merk, DA			Water source to four US wetlands: Implications for wetland management	WETLANDS												Results of long-term field studies of wetlands in four different hydrogeologic and climatic settings in the United States indicate that each has considerably different sources of water, which affects their response to climate variability and land-use practices. A fen wetland in New Hampshire is supplied almost entirely by ground water that originates as seepage from Mirror Lake; therefore, stream discharge from the fen closely follows the pattern of Mirror Lake stage fluctuations. A fen wetland in northern Minnesota is supplied largely by discharge from a regional ground-water flow system that has its recharge area 1 to 2 kin to the east. Because of the size of this wetland's ground-water watershed, stream discharge from the fen has little variability. A prairie-pothole wetland in North Dakota receives more than 90 percent of its water from precipitation and loses more than 90 percent of its water to evapotranspiration, resulting in highly variable seasonal and annual water levels. A wetland in the sandhills of Nebraska lies in a regional ground-water flow field that extends for tens of kilometers and that contains numerous lakes and wetlands. The wetland receives water that moves through the ground-water system from the upgradient lakes and from ground water in local flow systems that are recharged between the lakes. The difference in sources of water to these wetlands implies that they would require different techniques to protect their water supply and water quality.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0277-5212					DEC	2001	21	4					462	473		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0462:WSTFUS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0462:WSTFUS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000172918700002

Micro-hole and multigrain quartz luminescence dating of Paleodeltas at Lake Fryxell, McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), and relevance for lake history	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Relict (perched) lacustrine deltas around the perennially ice-covered lakes in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica, imply that these lakes were up to 40 times larger in area than at present since the last glacial maximum (LGM). These deltas have been used to constrain ice-margin positions in Taylor Valley, and the boundaries of the proposed LGM ice-damned Glacial Lake Washburn. The timing of these high lake levels has depended on C-14 chronologies of algal layers within relict lacustrine deltas. To provide additional geochronometric data for the post-LGM lake-level history, we applied photon-stimulated-luminescence (PSL) sediment dating to polymineral fine silt and sand-size quartz from 7 perched-delta and 3 activedelta sites of different elevations along 3 major meltwater streams entering Lake Fryxell. Our PSL dating of 4 quartz-sand samples from core tops in the seasonal ice-free moat of Lake Fryxell (elevation similar to 18 m a.s.1.) and two core-top moat samples from the seasonal moat of Lake Vanda in nearby Wright Valley establish that adequate PSL clock zeroing (by daylight) occurs in regional, modern shoreline deposits. Minimum-age micro-hole PSL results from the moats are consistently near 100 a. Minimum-age micro-hole age estimates for the deltas range from similar to 50 to 100 a near the present lake level up to 13.4 +/- 1.3 ka at 240 m. These are systematically younger than the comparable, reservoir-uncorrected, C-14 ages that range from 7 ka (cal yr BP) to 13 ka (cal yr BP) near lake level up to 20 ka (cal yr BP) at 220-240 m elevation. Our results indicate the occurrence of a dramatic discrepancy between PSL minimum-age and C-14 age estimates that is presently unresolved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal variations in the abundance of nauplii, copepodites, adults and their faecal pellets were assessed in the period January 2000 to December 2004. Development and behaviour of A. italica were regulated by thermohaline conditions, biology (phytoplankton, bacteria, ciliates), and chemistry (organic matter, dissolved oxygen, reduced sulphur species) of the lake. The diatom Chaetoceros curvisetus could provide important food for A. italica adult specimens; however, great diatom abundances could reduce copepod reproductive ability.

J	Pokorny, P				Pokorny, P			A high-resolution record of Late-Glacial and Early-Holocene climatic and environmental change in the Czech Republic	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					International Conference on Past Global Changes	SEP 06-09, 2000	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Geol, Czech Geol Survery, PAGES				Recent discovery of thick buried lake sediments in the Trebon Basin, South Bohemia, presents an exceptional opportunity to study the Late-Glacial history of eastern Central Europe. High-resolution investigation of pollen. plant macrofossils, algal remains. and lithology for the Late-Glacial and Early-Holocene sediments of former Lake Svarcenberk yielded a well-founded palaeoclimatic and palacovegetational data that can be compared with the results from other parts of a west-east European transect, taking into account the oceanic/continental gradient and its influence for palaeoenvironmental conditions. The results demonstrate that the effect of North Atlantic oceanic changes during the last glacial-interglacial transition extended to the investigated area. Nevertheless. significant differences in timing, intensity, and character of vegetational response to these climatic changes have been found between the area under study and the western part of Central Europe. These differences can be ascribed to increased seasonality, specific regional mesoclimatic and soil conditions, and possible local glacial refugia for pine. The results of sediment chemical analyses indicate a close correspondence between climatic, vegetational, and soil development in lake catchments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

During a one-year period, water quality parameters were evaluated in seven collection sites using a fish culture system as the reference point. A regression analysis was performed on water transparency versus chlorophyll a and total phosphorus versus chlorophyll a. The trophic state index (TSI) was calculated using data from water transparency, chlorophyll a, and total phosphorus. In addition, a study of the carrying capacity was conducted in situations of high and low flow and rainfall based on 725 m(3) s(-1) and 298 mm and 34.5 m(3) s(-1) and 11 mm, respectively. No difference was observed in the parameters of water quality and the TSI in relation to the collection sites; these parameters only varied significantly throughout the seasons. The regression analysis showed that increased total phosphorus in the environment leads to increase in chlorophyll a concentrations and consequently decreased water transparency. Evaluation of the carrying capacity demonstrated that under conditions of high precipitation and flow it is possible to produce 623.7 tons offish per year, which is above the total cultivated in fish farms at the study site.					; Lewandowski, Vanessa/MGU-5083-2025; Signor, Altevir/B-8527-2019	Bittencourt, Fabio/0000-0001-5894-7158; Signor, Altevir/0000-0002-4659-6466; Lewandowski, Vanessa/0000-0003-4946-5805													0003-4088	2100-000X				AUG 22	2018	54								27	10.1051/limn/2018018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2018018													WOS:000443102800001

We studied breeding success, lake use, and prey availability in wild mallards Anas platyrhynchos on small nemoral lakes in a replicated, two-year cross-over experiment in which pair density was increased. The number of wild mallards that settled on lakes prior to introductions of extra pairs did not differ between control and introduction years. Introductions led to a lake-level reduction in the number of broods observed. However, the number of stage 2+ (almost fledged) ducklings did not differ between treatments, nor did lake utilization by nonbreeding adults, broods and ducklings. Prey resource availability differed greatly among lakes, but it did not correlate with breeding success. Partialling out the possible effect of food competition from wild adult nonbreeding mallards did not change this conclusion. Our study demonstrates sequential density dependence in breeding success; introductions caused a decrease in brood number, but despite fewer broods a similar number of nearly fledged ducklings were produced. We suggest that predation and/or lake change of broods soon after hatching created these patterns. We conclude that using a single and late measure of breeding success such as fledged birds can mask regulatory processes. Implications of density dependence and its relation to individual reproductive success are understood better if breeding success is decomposed into nest success, duckling survival and fledgling survival.					; Elmberg, Johan/H-1868-2014; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021; Pöysä, Hannu/C-2601-2014	Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				MAR	2005	108	3					582	590		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13618.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13618.x													WOS:000226898200016
J	Kubokawa, K; Watanabe, T; Yoshioka, M; Iwata, M				Kubokawa, K; Watanabe, T; Yoshioka, M; Iwata, M			Effects of acute stress on plasma cortisol, sex steroid hormone and glucose levels in male and female sockeye salmon during the breeding season	AQUACULTURE												In the sockeye salmon (Onchorynchus nei-ka), as well as a number of migratory salmonid species, the plasma level of cortisol, the main stress hormone in fish, increases during the spawning period, and then fish die after the spawning. The response of cultured individuals of this species to an artificial acute stress during the spawning period was investigated by measuring levels of cortisol, sex steroid hormones and glucose in blood plasma. In addition, physiological changes in hormone and glucose levels were studied in wild individuals caught in the lake at different spawning stages of the natural condition. The fish cultured and matured in the research pond were confined in a small net and their blood was collected at 3, 5, 15 or 30 min after the start of confinement. Wild sockeye salmon were caught when they gathered in the mouth of their maternal river and their blood was collected just before and after ovulation and also after the artificial removal of eggs and sperm in pre-ovulatory individuals. Acute stress increased cortisol and glucose levels in males. However, in females, the initial cortisol level in the plasma was higher than that in males and did not change significantly with the confinement time. Testosterone levels in both sexes, 11-ketotestosterone levels in males and plasma 17 alpha-progesterone levels in females decreased with the confinement time. In the natural condition, cortisol levels were higher in females than in males and did not change until the last sampling. In males, the cortisol levels increased from the time of spawning until just before death. Glucose levels in males and females increased whereas cortisol levels in females did not change. It is concluded that during the breeding season. male sockeye salmon respond to confinement stress with elevated cortisol levels and decreased sex steroid levels, while female sockeye salmon show only the latter response. It is postulated that female sockeye salmon are not refractory to stress in the breeding period, because their sex steroid levels decrease in response to stress. In females, cortisol levels probably reach maximum levels before blood samples are taken. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Following the mass removal of coarse fish the biomass of cyanobacteria collapsed from 1.4 g/m(-3) to below 0.4 g/m(-3), while total phosphorus concentration declined from 45 mu g/L to 30 mu g/L. No relevant changes in zooplankton communities were observed. The results suggest that the success of food web manipulation as a tool for lake restoration is not necessarily dependent on the grazing rate of zooplankton. The effects of reduced fish-mediated internal loading and recycling of nutrients are in many cases stronger than those of reduced planktivory. Alternative stable states of water quality may also exist in lakes not covered by macrophytes, owing to the changes in the behavior of fish stocks. Year-to-year variation in the littoral zone may cause large oscillations in lake ecosystems-for example, through the recruitment of fish. In addition, the nutrients translocated by fish from the littoral zone may affect the nutrient dynamics of the pelagial plankton community. In terms of phytoplankton species composition and the ratio of phosphorus to chlorophyll a, the water quality in Lake Vesijarvi has improved in a stepwise fashion within the last 10 years. This is probably due to the fact that the five-year mass removal of fish in Enonselka fulfilled the requirement of sustained management of fish stocks in order to maintain nonequilibrial conditions between alternate stable states. The prediction of the water quality development is obscured, however, by spatial and temporal within-lake variation, which sets high requirements for sampling programs.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	1998	6	1					20	28		10.1046/j.1526-100x.1998.00613.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.1998.00613.x													WOS:000072503300002
J	Pope, CA; Hill, RW; Villegas, GM				Pope, CA; Hill, RW; Villegas, GM			Particulate air pollution and daily mortality on Utah's Wasatch Front	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												Reviews of daily time-series mortality studies from many cities throughout the world suggest that daily mortality counts are associated with short-term changes in particulate matter (PM) air pollution. One U.S. city, however, with conspicuously weak PM-mortality associations was Salt Lake City, Utah; however, relatively robust PM-mortality associations have been observed in a neighboring metropolitan area (Provo/Orem, Utah). The present study explored this apparent discrepancy by collecting, comparing, and analyzing mortality, pollution, and weather data for all three metropolitan areas on Utah's Wasatch Front region of the Wasatch Mountain Range (Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo/Orem) for approximately 10 years (1985-1995). Generalized additive Poisson regression models were used to estimate PM-mortality associations while controlling for seasonality, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. Salt Lake City experienced substantially more episodes of high PM that were dominated by windblown dust. When the data were screened to exclude obvious windblown dust episodes and when PM data from multiple monitors were dused to construct an estimate of mean exposure for the area, comparable PM-mortality effects were estimated. After screening and by using constructed mean PM less than or equal to 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) data, the estimated percent change in mortality associated with a 10-mg/m(3) increase in PM10 (and 95% confidence intervals) for the three Wasatch Front metropolitan areas equaled approximately 1.6% (0.3-2.9), 0.8% (0.3-1.3), and 1.0% (0.2-1.8) for the Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo/Orem areas, respectively. We conclude that stagnant air pollution episodes with higher concentrations of primary and secondary combustion-source particles were more associated with elevated mortality than windblown dust episodes with relatively higher concentrations of coarse crustal-derived particles.

Many mechanisms trying to explain top-down divergences between these systems have been proposed, such as lack of key species of herbivorous zooplankton, absence of seasonality in fish reproduction, cyanobacteria development, or differences in fish foraging behaviour. Very few studies have considered bottom-up mechanisms, in particular differences in nutrient recycling and nutrient limitation between the two types of ecosystems. According to the ecological stoichiometry theory, fish-induced alterations of food-web structure could modify the efficiency of consumer-driven nutrient recycling by changing the relative biomass contribution of species in food webs. Consequently, by mostly considering top-down processes, one could underestimate consequences on nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth. In this paper, we compared the results of two mesocosm experiments carried out in temperate and tropical areas, each manipulating food-web structure via the presence or absence of fish. We found trophic cascades in both experiments, but differences between fishless and fish treatments were greater in temperate than in tropical systems. In the tropical experiment, the observed effects could not be supported by classical zooplankton community alteration or by cyanobacteria prevalence. Our results suggest a key contribution of fish nitrogen-excretion to phytoplankton growth in mostly nitrogen-limited tropical systems. Differences in stoichiometric response to food-web structure alteration between temperate and tropical lakes could thus represent a major difference between the two systems. Our study stresses the need for further studies that would allow robust generalization on the functioning of freshwater temperate and tropical ecosystems.

This study evaluated fish from a hypereutrophic lake that had recently undergone a 40% reduction of large (> 300 mm total length, L-T) D. cepedianum biomass as part of a biomanipulation experiment, which aimed at reducing internal nutrient loading. Dorosoma cepedianum delta S-34 values showed evidence of ontogenetic changes with young fish (< 200 mm L-T) depending more on benthic food sources than adults (> 200 mm L-T). The delta S-34 composition of the adult fish suggested an increasing importance of zooplankton in the diet, although benthic food sources remained part of the diet of all D. cepedianum collected in this study. The results indicated that benthic feeding is used by D. cepedianum of all sizes, suggesting that biomanipulation efforts may need to target all sizes of fish to realize benefits.

Evidence for limited microbial transfer of methane in a planktonic food web	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Methane-derived carbon may be an important, but overlooked source of energy fueling food webs in a variety of aquatic ecosystems. Although it is commonly assumed that the flow of methane-derived carbon is regulated by aquatic invertebrate consumption of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), few studies have characterized this trophic interaction. We used stable isotope analysis, bioassay experiments, and PCR-based molecular techniques to investigate the interactions between Daphnia and MOB in the pelagic region of a humic lake located in southwestern Michigan, USA. We observed moderate depletion of C-13 in the plankton, but these data alone could not provide evidence for the consumption of MOB by Dajohnia. Using quantitative PCR, we determined that MOB attained relatively high densities in the water column (3% of the bacterial community), but we found no evidence that they were grazed upon by Dajohnia. Moreover, our results do not support the hypothesis that Daphnia harbored symbiotic MOB. Therefore, the isotopic composition of Daphnia could not be explained by direct trophic interactions with MOB, suggesting the potential importance of indirect trophic interactions (e.g. consumption of MOB-feeding protists) or other processes that alter the isotopic composition of zooplankton resources (e.g. CO2 recycling).					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; Lennon, Jay/ABE-6120-2020	Lennon, Jay T./0000-0003-3126-6111; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; 													0948-3055	1616-1564					2009	58	1					45	53		10.3354/ame01349	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01349													WOS:000273539500004

At the three study sites, the increase of chlorophyll a concentrations in April paralleled those of the iron bound phosphate accounting for major portion of sediment inorganic phosphate, and in June significantly higher OPB and IPB numbers (especially OPB) in sediment were main contributors to the peaks of chlorophyll a concentration. Even though IPB peaked from February to June, it should serve as an unimportant P source due to the irrelevancy with chlorophyll a and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). By contrast, at the other site in the embayment, the calcium-bound phosphate was predominant and solid, which was difficult to be released, and neither IPB nor OPB were detectable in the sediment, indicating weak potential for phosphorus release from the sediment, which was reflected in the small seasonal variation in SRP concentration in water column. Hence, the extents to which the three general mechanisms behind phosphate release from sediment (desorption of iron bound phosphate, solubilization by IPB and enzymatic hydrolysis by OPB) operated were different depending on seasons and sites in Lake Taihu, they may jointly drive phosphate release and accelerate the eutrophication processes.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					2009	26	7					508	515	PII 915037164	10.1080/01490450903061119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450903061119													WOS:000269876500007

CM was created in 2002 and was still being dredged during the study period while sand quarrying in CS began in 1998 and ended at the beginning of the study period These conditions were thought to be of particular interest in assessing the influence of dredging activities on algal assemblages. Physical and chemical water parameters were also analysed to characterise the two lakes and investigate the effects of hydro-chemical features on phytoplankton. CS was stratified from April to October each year during the study period, while CM showed weaker thermal stratification. Conductivity, dissolved nitrate and dissolved reactive silica concentrations were greater in CM than in CS. The mixing depth/euphotic depth ratio was also higher in CM, probably because of water column mixing induced by hydraulic dredging. Overall. 185 phytoplankton taxa were found, of which ca 50% were present in both lakes. No significant diffrences in species richness were observed between lakes, but the decreasing trend of Simpson index values measured in CS showed a reduction in biodiversity after the excavation phose. Phytoplankton biomass was higher in CS than in CM, the latter being oligo-mesotrophic and the former mesotrophic. Diatoms and dinoflagellates were the dominant taxa in both lakes. The main differences in phytoplankton assemblages were related to the persistence of chryptophytes and chlorophytes in CM. Multivariate analyses support the hypothesis that different thermal patterns induced by dredging activities, along with certain physico-chemical parameters of the water, were the major factors shaping phytoplankton communities.

Nitrogen exports at multiple-scales in a southern Chilean watershed (Patagonian Lakes district)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We evaluated nitrogen (N) export for various catchments in the San Pedro River watershed of South- central Chile (39 degrees 20' to 40 degrees 12'S) during the dry season (February to March). We measured concentrations and export of the various N species at 16 points from the Andean headwaters to the lowland portion of the watershed: eight main nested points along the main watershed and eight secondary points on tributaries. We expected that, given a downstream increase in pastureland and decrease in native pristine forest cover, inorganic forms of N (DIN) would increase downstream, while conversely, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) would decrease compared with concentrations in the forested headwaters. Nitrogen concentrations did not show statistically significant differences among the nested catchments. However, there were statistically significant differences in N concentrations associated with land cover among the tributaries. The results suggest that in the presence of base flow, natural landscape properties (barren land, lakes and rivers), explained most of the spatial variation in the N exports, while anthropogenic disturbance was not detectable. There was a negative relationship between DIN export and the coverage of lakes and rivers, suggesting that lakes might be acting as N traps. On the other hand, DIN, DON and total N exports were positively associated to barren land. Total nitrogen export during this 60- day dry season was less than 20 kg km(-2) and the annual export was not larger than 100 kg km(-2). This study documents the as yet pristine conditions of rivers in southern Chile.

In this study, the Changxing Plain River Network in the Taihu Lake Basin was chosen as the research area, where the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was used for source apportionment and the Risk Quotient (RQ) and Hazard Index (HI) method were applied for ecological risk assessment. Seasonal variations revealed that antibiotic concentrations were higher during the dry season (N.D-138 ng/L) compared to the wet season (N.D similar to 22 ng/L), with concentrations in the Jiapu River significantly exceeding those in the other three rivers. PMF model identified four major pollution sources: aquaculture (11 %), diffuse pollution (42 %), urban sewage (30 %), and agriculture (17 %), with diffuse pollution being the largest contributor to antibiotic pollution. Antibiotic flux calculations indicated that the Jiapu River contributed the highest antibiotic load to Taihu Lake, followed by the Changxing River. Ecological risk analysis based on RQ values revealed that erythromycin (ERY), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and enrofloxacin (ENO) posed moderate risks during the dry season. This study underscores the impacts of various human activities on riverine antibiotic emissions; highlights the need for effective regulation of urban and diffuse pollution; and provides a scientific basis for the formulation of pollution prevention strategies for antibiotic management in Taihu Lake.					庞, 舒婷/GRY-5821-2022														2405-6650	2405-6642				SEP	2025	11	3							100540	10.1016/j.emcon.2025.100540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emcon.2025.100540													WOS:001535000800001
J	Ciechanowski, M; Zapart, A				Ciechanowski, Mateusz; Zapart, Aneta			The diet of the pond bat Myotis dasycneme and its seasonal variation in a forested lakeland of northern Poland	ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA												The diet of the Central European trawling vespertilionid, the pond bat Myotis dasycneme, was studied in a nursery roost in the postglacial lakeland of northern Poland, based on a very large (n = 1,725) sample of faecal pellets. This is only the third published dietary study of the species, considered to have a high conservation priority in Europe. Pond bats' prey was dominated by non-biting midges (Chironomidae - both imagines and pupae) and caddis flies (Trichoptera). However, the spectrum of prey was relatively broad, with 16 taxa, including 12 recorded for the first time in the diet of M. dasycneme. Frequency of occurrence (O%) of particular taxa varied through the season. O% of caddis flies and non-biting midges in droppings were negatively correlated (r(s) = -0.75, P < 0.05); exceptionally high O% of caddis flies, being larger (and presumably more profitable) prey, occurred in late June and July, coinciding with high energy demands of lactating females. No evidence of piscivory was revealed.																			1508-1109	1733-5329					2012	14	1					73	79		10.3161/150811012X654286	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/150811012X654286													WOS:000308720900007

Effects of water levels and water level regulation on the supply of suitable spawning habitat for eight fish guilds in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Lake Ontario water levels are regulated under the International Joint Commission's Order of Approval. We assessed the availability of spawning habitat for eight fish guilds (grouped by vegetation and spawning temperature preferences) that use nearshore habitat in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, under regulated and pre-project water level scenarios. Our model used habitat characteristics of depth, substrate, vegetation cover and temperature across 14,876 habitat units and guild-based habitat suitabilities to assess the weighted suitable area (WSA) available for spawning. During the modelled 19512000 period, regulated water levels were on average 0.25 m lower than pre-project levels and varied about half as much. Overall, the large and shallow upper bay within the Bay of Quinte benefited from pre-project flows whereas the smaller and deeper lower bay benefited from regulated flows. Higher variance in water levels increased highly suitable wetland area and higher mean water levels increased the availability of shallow flooded area in the upper and middle bays, where the bathymetry is gradually sloping. The number of days over which WSA was available was generally greater for high temperature guilds, and appeared to decrease when temperature mismatches occurred in a season. Results emphasize the complexity of the relationship between fish habitat supply and water level regime.

Optimization of viral profiling approaches reveals strong links between viral and bacterial communities in a eutrophic freshwater lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The goals of this 18 mo field study were to examine temporal changes in viral community composition in a temperate eutrophic freshwater lake (Lake Matoaka) and to identify potential drivers of seasonal changes in microbial community composition. We show that analyses of aquatic viral community composition can be streamlined by concentrating viruses from small water samples without compromising the resolution of the community profile data. The use of small-volume viral concentrates paired with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polmerase chain reaction (PCR) generated significantly richer and more complex banding patterns than the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the large-volume concentrates that PFGE requires. Thus, the small-volume RAPD-PCR approach was used in the subsequent analyses. Viral and bacterial communities in Lake Matoaka were highly dynamic, exhibiting strong seasonal shifts. However, repeating annual patterns were not detected among the bacterial or viral communities. Temperature was the most important factor explaining changes in viral and bacterial abundance. Viral and bacterial abundance were also significantly correlated to each other. Multivariate analysis indicated weak relationships between temperature and bacterial community composition and between temperature and viral community composition. Mantel tests revealed a strong and significant correlation between viral and bacterial community composition. Taken together with the correlation between viral and bacterial abundance, these data suggest that phages dominate the virioplankton of Lake Matoaka and indicate tightly linked phage-host dynamics.					; Kendra, Joseph/AAA-1844-2020	Glasner, Dustin/0000-0001-9821-6683; Kendra, Joseph/0000-0001-5886-7377													0948-3055	1616-1564					2012	67	1					59	76		10.3354/ame01582	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01582													WOS:000308651800006

Influence of acid sand pit lakes in surrounding groundwater chemistry, Sepetiba sedimentary basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Seropedica-Itaguai sand mining district has an important role in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region, supplying approximately 70% of the sand for civil construction. The sand extraction process removes surface sedimentary layers (with quartz-feldspatic composition), increasing water table in the mined pit. However, this activity causes some chemical and physico-chemical changes in the water, such as the oxidation of reduced sediments lowering pH values (reaching values <3.5) and increasing SO4 concentration (reaching more than 90 mg.I-1). The relatively low pH values of those waters promote an increase of weathering rate, especially the silicate minerals and, as a consequence, high Al concentrations (>10 mg.I-1) are obtained. Four sand pit lakes and four wells located close to each other were sampled from November 2005 to March 2007. The groundwater physico-chemical parameters and the dissolved species in the sand pit lakes are controlled by sand extraction process as well as the rainfall regime. During dry season the reduced sediments become exposed by the water table drawdown, promoting oxidation which releases H + and other ions present in those lithologies. The increase of water table during wet season induces lithologies lixiviation, increasing the concentration of dissolved species in groundwater. However it also promotes a decreasing of pH values due to the diluting factor induced by rainwater infiltration. During dry season, the sand pit lakes have high pH values due to buffering action caused by the dissolved species present, leading to the ion shielding for H+, caused by evapoconcentration process (high ionic strength for this season). The evapoconcentration conditions along that season promote the precipitation of some complex salts of Na+, Mg2+, Cl- and sulfate, decreasing the concentrations of major dissolved species. The opposite occurs during wet season, where pH values increase due the rainwater input, breaking the ion shielding (lower ionic strength) and dissolving some precipitated compounds (increasing the concentrations of major dissolved constituents). PHREEQC and WATEQ4F modeling were used for sand pit lakes and groundwater samples in order to show the Al behavior in these specific environments, which could be a limiting factor for an aquaculture activity towards the end of mining activities. The sand pit lakes showed Al3+ as the main dissolved species in both dry and wet season, while groundwater presented Al(OH)(2+) and Al(OH)(2)(+), which are the most toxic species for aquatic life. The dissolved aluminum concentration in the studied environments was considered by the minerals formation, which the SO42- salts complex are the main Al scavengers, followed by the silicate minerals in both seasons. The information provided by this study gives an insight to the conditions of aquaculture in sand pit lakes, having peculiar characteristics. On the other hand, the dissolved aluminum should be considered in groundwater due to the possible water contamination, considering that wells used for water consumption are prevalent in the region.

Strategies to Enhance the Interpretation of Single-Particle Ambient Aerosol Data	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												New instruments are beginning to reveal the chemical complexity of atmospheric aerosol particles. Exploitation of the plethora of information being made accessible through aerosol particle spectrometry and other techniques requires new strategies for data interpretation. This paper demonstrates and evaluates several analysis methods used to exploit this single-particle high-time-resolution data. In the first part of this study, Standard Reference Material (SRM) particulate matter samples were analyzed by an Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) in order to evaluate the use of a modified, logarithm based, method of clustering mass spectra using the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART-2a) algorithm. In the second part of this study, data obtained from the ATOFMS during the four seasons of 2007 were interpreted using a variety of approaches so as to elucidate the nature and sources of particles influencing the great lakes region of North America. This dataset is believed to represent the longest time-span of single-particle data ever analyzed in a study of this nature. These mass spectra were clustered into 21 different particle types using the supervised log-transformed ART-2a algorithm. Both long-term seasonal trends and high-time-resolution temporal patterns of particle type concentrations were examined. Source identification was supported by comparison with known source samples. Potential source contribution functions were used to identify source regions. This paper describes and evaluates these approaches to data interpretation using examples from the ambient air study to illustrate the methodology and highlight the findings. Furthermore, these ambient examples demonstrate how the application of these strategies enhances the interpretation of single-particle ambient aerosol data.

Numerous Final Stone Age sites of the Gajiganna Culture (1,800 to 800 B.C.) in the Lake Chad Basin (northeast Nigeria) yielded plant impressions in potsherds. The ceramics of Phase I (1,800-1,400 B.C.) were mineral tempered, and plant impressions, mainly of Paniceae, were caused only by incidental inclusion. In contrast, a considerable number of the sherds from Phase II (1,500-800 B.C.) were intentionally tempered with chaff derived from domesticated pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), wild Paniceae and wild rice species (Oryza cf. barthii and O. cf. longistaminata). This plant spectrum suggests the exploitation of the wet wild areas, and also the cultivation of pearl millet on sandy soils. The evidence suggests that agricultural practices were established late and were introduced from elsewhere. During the time of seasonally occupied sites in Phase I, the subsistence strategy was based on herding, fishing, and gathering, while in Phase II there are signs of permanent settlements and agriculture. The evidence from the plant impressions indicates that in the Final Stone Age Gajiganna Culture around 1,000-800 B.C., pearl millet became well established while the gathering of wild millets and rice was still practised.

J	Talling, JF				Talling, JF			Environmental controls on the functioning of shallow tropical lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Science and the Sustainable Management of Shallow Tropical Waters	APR 11-16, 1999	NAIVASHA, KENYA					Shallowness and tropicality primarily relate to physical aspects of environmental regulation. These concern water input and output, with correlates associated with water level and salinity; energy balance and beat distribution, with correlates of temperature and density stratification; and largely wind-driven water movements, with consequences in chemical and biological distributions. Shallowness in a water-column affects the quantitative relationship between many stock quantities and flux rates per unit surface area. Evaporative loss of water is one familiar example; sensitivity to surface energy exchanges provides others. Somewhat different are processes that depend upon transmission with depth. Here light penetration, convective penetration and wind-generated turbulence with flow-depth relations are illustrative. Tropicality further influences by climatic factors, especially of solar radiation and rainfall. Energy balance tends to yield year-long elevated water temperature at all depths, but at a level dependent upon altitude. The magnitude and seasonal periodicity of water input is widely dependent upon the inter-tropical convergence zone in atmospheric circulation. Over the arid and semi-arid tropics, the lakes may lie in closed drainage basins and be influenced by evaporative concentration with salinization. Shallow takes of tropical Africa are used to illustrate these varied environmental constraints and some of their biological consequences.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	2001	458						1	8		10.1023/A:1013121522321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013121522321													WOS:000173248500002

Frequent incursions of polar advections causing cooling and humidity, a cool and foggy climate in the middle of the depression and warmer temperatures on the surrounding slopes help to maintain all these groups within a fairly restricted area. Late Pleistocene-Holocene climatic change has had a considerable impact on the flora and vegetation of Salitre. The pollen record of the 6 m deep core LC3 shows how cold forest trees such as Araucaria angustifolia and Drimys brasiliensis, semi-deciduous forest, halophytic plants and peat bog started to develop on this site. The initial period, between c. 50,000 and 40,000 yr B.P., was an arid phase not recorded in any other neotropical lowland site. It was followed by a period of high moisture levels (40,000 to 27,000 yr B.P.) with a maximum estimated at c. 35,000 yr B.P. The Late Glacial maximum is missing because of a gap in sedimentation. Humidity gradually increased during the Late Pleistocene, between 16,000 and 11,000 yr B.P. The early Holocene, 9500 to 5000 yr B.P., is characterized by a more marked seasonal pattern and higher temperatures, reaching a maximum c. 5000 yr B.P. The spread of semi-deciduous forest between 4000 and 3000 yr B.P. attests to a return of humidity. Comparison with the Serra Negra section (19 degrees S, 46 degrees 45'-46'W, 1170 m elev.) not far from Salitre confirms the high moisture rates recorded at c. 35-40,000 yr B.P. (although temperatures were cooler at the altitude of Serra Negra, as is attested by the presence of Araucaria forest) and also confirms the strong impact of polar advections on the climate of Southeastern Brazil.					; Turcq, Bruno/IYJ-9120-2023	Turcq, Bruno/0000-0002-7782-5268; Ledru, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-8079-9320; 													0031-0182					JUL	1996	123	1-4					239	&		10.1016/0031-0182(96)00105-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(96)00105-8													WOS:A1996UX64700012

Four diets were formualted isonitrogenous and isocaloric to contain different MCs concentrations: the control diet (free of cyanobacteria), low cyanobacteria diet (LCD, 26.60 mu g MCs/g diet), medium cyanobacteria diet (MCD, 78.82 mu g MCs/g diet), and high cyanobacteria diet (HCD, 201.03 mu g MCs/g diet). During the first 47 days, each diet was fed to fish in five replicates and then all fish were fed the control diet during the next 43 days. The results showed that a dose-dependent decrease in feeding rate (FR) and specific growth rate (SGR) were observed in the fish fed with MCD and HCD. MCs contents in fish liver, intestine, and dorsal white muscle increased with dietary MCs and were time dependent (P < 0.05). After the 43-day recovery, there were no significant differences in FR or SGR between the fish previously fed LCD or MCD and the fish fed with the control diet (P > 0.05), while the fish previously fed HCD showed higher FR and SGR than those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). MCs clearance in fish liver and intestine showed time-dependence during the 43-day recovery. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Gajinri site, Gainri site, and Yongsanri site are the lower middle part, the upper middle part, and the uppermost part of the Haman Formation, respectively. The bird footprints of the Gajinri site occur in alternation of medium-to fine-grained sandstone and mudstone lithofacies deposited on an alluvial plain. The bird footprints of the Gainri site occur in alternation of fine-grained sandstone to siltstone and mudstone lithofacies, which were deposited on an alluvial plain to lake margin (sandflat to mudflat). The bird footprints of the Yongsanri site are preserved in interlaminated to thinly interbedded fine-grained sandstone to siltstone and mudstone lithofacies deposited on a lake margin (mudflat). The bird footprint-bearing deposits of the Haman Formation were formed by sheetflooding on alluvial plain to lake margin (sandflat to mudflat) under seasonal climates with alternation of wetting and drying periods. Various mudcracks, asymmetrical and symmetrical ripple marks, diverse small invertebrate trace fossils and dinosaur footprints are commonly observed, and evaporite mineral pseudomorphs and petrified wood fragments are occasionally present in these sheetflooding deposits. The bird footprints showing deep and distinctive impression and raised rim by trampling are associated with asymmetrical and symmetrical ripple marks and small invertebrate trace fossils on occasion and are rarely associated with mudcracks. It suggests that the footprints were formed on wet substrate or in subaqueous condition after a sheetflooding event and suffered short evaporation caused by subsequent drying prior to rapid burial. The footprints made by shorebirds or waterbirds are commonly dense and bill probe marks are present in places. It is implied that birds were gregarious and had high activities such as trampling and catching foods on a shore. It resulted in abundant occurrence and high preservation of the bird footprints. The abundant occurrence of the bird footprints in several stratigraphical horizons and sheetfloodig deposits formed on alluvial plain to lake margin (sandflat to mudflat) of the Haman Formation at various sites suggests that the depositional environments of the Cretaceous Haman Formation provided good habitats for birds under the favorable environmental conditions as well as the high preservational potentials.																			0435-4036	2288-7377				APR	2011	47	2					97	122																WOS:000454016600001

FACTORS DETERMINING FISH SPECIES DIVERSITY IN AMAZONIAN FLOODPLAIN LAKES	AMAZON BASIN: PLANT LIFE, WILDLIFE AND ENVIRONMENT	Environmental Research Advances											A central question in ecological research is to understand the mechanisms that explain the diversity of natural communities. A key component to this question is the often controversial issue of the extent to which abiotic factors such as seasonal or diurnal environmental fluctuations, versus biotic factors such as competition and predation, are more important in regulating species diversity. At least 3,000 fish species are known to inhabit the Amazon River Basin, and many more undoubtedly remain to be discovered. However, the spatial distribution of species within this broad area is heterogeneous, and studies indicate that fish species diversity in floodplain lakes varies between those fed by black water and white water tributaries. Overall species richness in black water and white water lakes is similar, varying between about 80-250 species, but species composition differs, and many species are endemic to one type of lake. Floodplain lakes of both types are subject to highly dynamic annual cycles of high and low water, in which water levels vary by approximately 15 meters. Forests between lakes can be dry for several months during low water, which isolates them from each other and from the main river channels. Conversely, they become interconnected during high water for the rest of the year, when the intervening forests are flooded. Until recently, explanations for fish diversity in the region as a whole, as well as between these two lake types, have emphasized geological age, habitat heterogeneity, and productivity. With regard to age, the Amazon Basin has long been connected to other neotropical basins, which have over time contributed species to the region. Habitat heterogeneity is promoted by a mixture of flooded forest and open water, and aquatic macrophytes that provide both shelter and feeding areas for fish communities. Productivity has been postulated to explain the difference in fish community composition between white water and black water systems within this region: The white water system has higher productivity, originating in the Andean and Pre-Andean Region, while black water rivers originate in ancient plateaus. Biotic interactions such as competition and predation have also been cited as possible explanations for fish diversity in these floodplain lakes and within the region as a whole, as well as the potential for metacommunity dynamics among lakes that become isolated from each other during low water. We discuss the evidence related to these ideas about what generates and maintains fish species diversity in Amazon floodplain lakes.

Distribution of foraminifera and ostracods in the Onkaparinga Estuary, South Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Analysis of sediment and aquatic vegetation samples collected along the Onkaparinga estuary, South Australia, revealed the distribution patterns of benthic and epi-benthic micro-organisms, specifically foraminifera and ostracods. The total assemblage provided an assemblage 'snap shot,' contemporaneous with the environmental conditions at the time of sampling, as well as seasonally and time-averaged distribution information. Species richness is low in the upper reaches of the estuary and favours species with a wide salinity tolerance. Observed species richness increases seawards. Species richness and abundance within species is greater where there is conspicuous aquatic vegetation. Thus, species richness and distribution appear to be related to the proximity to the sea and the provision of diverse habitable substrate. Foraminiferal species, Ammonia beccarii and Elphidium excavatum, and ostracods belonging to the genera Paracypria, Xestolebris and Leptocythere dominate the total assemblage. These species are characteristic of euryhaline conditions. The mutual maximum occurrences of Reophax barwonensis, Ammobaculites barwonensis and Trochammina inflata signify mid-estuarine conditions. In the lower regions of the estuary, the appearance of shallow marine species of foraminifera such as Elphidium crispum and Quinqueloculina poeyana, and ostracods Bairdoppilata sp., Hemicytherura spp. and Paranesidea spp. signifies interactions with the adjacent inner shelf coastal waters. Throughout the entire length of the estuary, the presence of vegetal substrate created a strong numerical bias towards live occurrences of the ostracods Paracypria sp. and Xestolebris cedunaensis. These species are potentially useful as proxies for paleoenvironmental interpretations of estuarine sediments.																			0812-0099						2010	57	7					901	910	PII 927268854	10.1080/08120099.2010.512644	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2010.512644													WOS:000282170100004
J	Tejerina-Garro, FL; de Mérona, B				Tejerina-Garro, Francisco Leonardo; de Merona, Bernard			Flow seasonality and fish assemblage in a tropical river, French Guiana, South America	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The objective of this study is to verify the existence of a seasonal pattern of variation in the fish assemblages of a tropical river using taxonomic and functional descriptors. Fish were sampled using gillnets at two sites on the Comte River, a large-sized river 254.8 km long, flowing entirely through rainforest areas of French Guiana. Samplings were conducted every other month from August 1998 to July 2000. Four types of fish assemblage descriptors were used: the species descriptor (number of individual fish of each species in the sample); the family descriptor (number of individual fish of each family in the sample); the trophic descriptor (distribution of the fish biomass in each feeding guild) and the specific maximum observed size-MOS (number of individual fish in each of four classes of MOS: < 100 mm; 101-200 mm; 201-300 mm; > 300 mm). Results point out that changes in the fish assemblage are related to water level oscillations. The role of migration seems to be weak and is limited to trophic displacements characteristic of few species. In the low-water season, characterized by weak water level oscillation, fish species and families belonging to piscivorous or aquatic invertivorous guilds were predominant, whereas in the high-water season the environment is submitted to strong variations caused by fast and large water level oscillations, and the fish assemblage was characterized by species or families with an opportunistic omnivorous diet.

Matrix-bound phosphine in paddy fields under a simulated increase in global atmospheric CO2	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The behaviour of matrix-bound phosphine (MBP) in paddy fields under elevated [CO2] (ambient + 200 mu mol mol(-1)) is investigated to understand the soil phosphorus cycle and its link to increasing global atmospheric [CO2]. MBP concentrations range from 17.0 +/- 5.8 to 1035 +/- 331 ng kg(-1). Concentrations at the transplanting and harvest stages are significantly higher than during the growing stages. The MBP level (212 +/- 61 ng kg(-1)) under elevated [CO2] is slightly higher than under ambient [CO2] (189 +/- 44 ng kg(-1)). Root exudates and addition of inorganic phosphate fertiliser speed up the production of MBP, whereas fast paddy growth and increasing air temperature accelerate the emission of MBP into the atmosphere. Significant positive correlations are found between MBP and inorganic phosphorus and organic matter, indicating that MBP may be produced from the microbial reduction of inorganic phosphorus in paddy fields.					; hq, ren/AGA-1128-2022	Ren, Hong-qiang/0000-0001-6136-800X; 													1448-2517	1449-8979					2010	7	3					287	291		10.1071/EN09164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN09164													WOS:000278974000009

The physico-chemical characteristics of the three largest inflowing rivers (Rusizi, Malagarasi, and Lufubu) and the wet atmospheric deposition in Bujumbura (Burundi), Kigoma (Tanzania), and Mpulungu (Zambia) were analyzed. The magnitude of external loading of P and N were evaluated to determine their potential for supporting biological activity. Seasonal changes in the physico-chemical composition of riverine input were detected and were linked to the altitude and morphology of the river system. A flushing effect was noted. Higher discharge rates corresponded with increased concentrations most constituents. Rusizi provided the most and Lufubu the least of total riverine nutrient input. Rusizi's load equalled or almost doubled, depending on the nutrient, the combined loads of the other rivers. Seasonal changes in the atmospheric deposition chemistry were detected and were linked to biomass burning and atmospheric transport processes. Highest atmospheric deposition rates were encountered in more populated and industrialized Bujumbura. Long- and short-term atmospheric washouts were observed. Concentrations of rainwater components were on most occasions higher at the beginning than at the end of the rainy season. A similar trend was observed during separate rain events. Wet atmospheric deposition provided approximately 83% of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), 37% of total phosphorus (TP), 63% of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), 65% of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), but only 1% of soluble reactive silicate (SRSi) of external source loading. The remaining load was derived from riverine sources. DIN, TP, TDP, SRP, and SRSi yearly net fluxes through wet deposition and riverine input were calculated as 58, 5.4, 2.5, 2, and 99 mmol per m(2) lake surface, respectively. Annual external loading of N and P potentially induced a new production of 45 to 60 g c/m(2)/yr (ca. 7 to 14 % of annual primary production). External loading forms the main pathway for nutrients to enter the productive layers of Lake Tanganyika during stratified and oligotrophic periods (February to May).					; Koelmans, Albert/D-8603-2014	Koelmans, Albert/0000-0001-7176-4356; 													0380-1330						2003	29			2			169	180		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70546-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70546-2													WOS:000221126800013

Central Asia is a region where forests are naturally scarce and additionally are under high anthropogenic pressure due to an unmet demand for timber and fuelwood. Cultivation of fast-growing trees as a means to satisfy this need may, therefore, be instrumental to forest conservation and/or restoration efforts. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in Paulownia spp. as agroforestry or plantation tree. Paulownia is a deciduous tree genus of Chinese origin that is valued for its fast growth and light, yet sturdy wood, among other characteristics. This study investigated the water consumption, biomass production, and water productivity of Paulownia tomentosa x fortunei (trade name: Shan Tong) in a plantation setting on the northern shore of Lake Issyk-Kul (Kyrgyzstan) over the course of the vegetation period 2019. The method employed was Granier's thermal dissipation probe for measuring sap flow in trees. Estimated trunk biomass production per tree and season ranged from 1.52 to 3.41 kg, and the trees were found to consume between 433 and 613 l of water in total over the growing season. Water productivity, the amount of exploitable stem biomass produced per litre of water input, consequently ranged between 4.3 and 8.0 g l(-1). As numerous studies suggest that the thermal dissipation method underestimates tree water consumption to varying degrees, these values likely represent the upper range of the species' water productivity. A literature review shows its water productivity to be higher than that of regionally employed tree species such as Populus euphratica or Elaeagnus angustifolia.

Vulnerability of diatom communities in the Peace-Athabasca Delta to environmental change	PEERJ												Habitat degradation associated with resource development is a major ecological concern, particularly in Canada's boreal zone where limited information on biodiversity is available. Habitat degradation can lead to reductions in biodiversity and ecosystem function, especially when drivers of variability and diversity patterns have not been identified for a region of interest. In this study, the distribution of diatom genera in the Peace-Athabasca Delta in northeastern Alberta was examined in relation to seasonal, geographic, and alkalinity gradients. Grab samples of six abiotic variables (total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved iron, turbidity, pH, and specific conductance (SPC)) were taken from 12 remote wetlands over three sampling periods, and regressed against an ordination of diatom community composition to identify key environmental drivers of diatom community variation. Indirect gradient analysis identified two major gradients among sites. First, separation of sites among sampling periods showed successional seasonal changes in diatom community composition. Second, separation of sites from the Peace sub-delta and Birch sub-delta showed a gradient of geographic separation. Direct gradient analysis failed to explain the underlying drivers of these two gradients, but did show that alkalinity is a key driver of diatom community composition in the Embarras sub-delta, and that these sites could be particularly vulnerable to community changes associated with acidification.

J	Carstensen, J				Carstensen, Jacob			Censored data regression: Statistical methods for analyzing Secchi transparency in shallow systems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Secchi depth monitoring in shallow ecosystems occasionally records sight to the bottom and thus the true Secchi depth is larger than the observed. In such cases Secchi depth data are censored. Despite that statistical methods for analyzing such censored data have existed for many decades and have been widely used in other disciplines, the censoring problem has been completely overlooked in aquatic ecology. Here, I have presented and exemplified a statistical regression technique (Censored Data Regression, CDR) that specifically addresses censored data, and compared resulting estimates of mean and standard error of Secchi depth distributions with those of statistical methods commonly applied in the literature. Standard methods increasingly underestimated both mean and standard error of Secchi depths as the proportion of censored data increased. Analysis of measured Secchi depths from four coastal sites in Denmark, representing 29% to 80% censored data, documented substantial biases in distribution means (up to 2 m), and standard errors (50 %) when censoring was not accounted for. This had significant repercussions for the estimation of trends and seasonal patterns of Secchi depths, in the worst case actually reporting no significant trend when a trend was actually present. Consequently, there is a need to introduce CDR as a more appropriate method for analyzing Secchi depths in shallow lakes and coastal ecosystems. More generally, the objective of this study was to raise the awareness of the censoring problem and to promote appropriate statistical methods for analyzing censored ecological data.

J	Oswald, A; Ransom, JK				Oswald, A; Ransom, JK			Response of maize varieties to Striga infestation	CROP PROTECTION												Striga hermonthica is endemic in the semi-arid and semi-humid areas of Sub-Sahara Africa. This plant parasite reduces crop yields of maize and sorghum, the major staple food source of the region. Presently, there are no Striga-resistant maize varieties commercially available in Western Kenya. Striga resistant or tolerant maize would form an important part of an integrated control approach. To determine the response of the maize varieties most widely grown by farmers around Lake Victoria to Striga, a field experiment was conducted at two locations and over two seasons. The results showed a high variability among commercial maize varieties with respect to the effects of Striga parasitism. Short-cycle varieties have the lowest Striga densities but produce acceptable yields only in low-stress environments. Long-cycle varieties are too susceptible to Striga and are not completely adapted to the agroecological conditions of the region. Some medium-cycle varieties show level of resistance and/or tolerance to Striga while others supported high numbers of Striga and had reduced yield. Nevertheless, sufficient genetic variability exists to recommend varieties suitable to enable farmers to obtain some yield advantage by selecting those with the most Striga tolerance for a range of farming situations found in Western Kenya.

During the growing season, throughfall deposition under both stands was significantly depleted in H+ and NH4+ compared with wet deposition, and a significant uptake of NO3- was observed under the coniferous canopy. Deposition of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, and SO42- was significantly higher in the throughfall than in the wet precipitation. During the growing season, the coniferous stand was more efficient in retaining nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3-), while H+ was more intensively retained in the deciduous stand. Significant interactions between precipitation and forest canopies were also observed during the dormant season: throughfall depositions of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and Cl- were significantly higher than wet precipitation under both canopies, while throughfall SO42- was significantly enriched only under the coniferous stand. Using a Na+ ratio method, foliar leaching was found mostly responsible for the throughfall enrichment on a full-year basis in both stands, with values averaging 61, 73, and 96% of the total throughfall fluxes for Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, respectively. Under both stands, net canopy exchange (NCE) of base cations, expressed on a monthly basis, were correlated to water volume and to H+ and SO42- deposition. Multiple regression models including wet SO42- deposition and an estimate of dry S deposition, explained up to 88% (Ca2+ in the coniferous stand) of the variance in base cation NCE under both stands.

In this study, we performed an in situ reciprocal transplant experiment on the surface and bottom waters of two lakes (Tsuei-Feng (T) and Yuan-Yang (Y)) with disparate trophic states and tracked changes in their microbial community composition and functions for 6 weeks using high-throughput sequencing and functional approaches. T lake's surface (Ts) and bottom (Tb) water active bacterial community (16S rRNA genetranscript) was dominated by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Cyanobacteria, whereas Y lake's surface (Ys) and bottom (Yb) water had Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia as the dominant classes. The community composition was resistant to changes in environmental conditions following the reciprocal transplant, but their functions tended to become similar to the incubating lakes' functional profiles. A significant linear positive relationship was observed between the microbial community and functional attributes (surface: R2 = 0.5065, p < 0.0001; bottom: R2 = 0.4592, p < 0.0001), though with varying scales of similarity (1-Bray Curtis distance), suggesting partial functional redundancy. Also, the entropy-based L-divergence measure identified high divergence in community composition (surface: 1.21 +/- 0.54; bottom: 1.17 +/- 0.51), and relatively low divergence in functional attributes (surface: 0.04 +/- 0.01; bottom: 0.04 +/- 0.01) in the two lakes' surface and bottom waters, providing further support for the presence of partial functional redundancy. This study enriches our un-derstanding of community functional relationships and establishes the presence of partial functional redundancy in freshwater ecosystems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Mean population density for the two frogs was 1.55 +/- 0.44 frogs per ha, with that for the Skittering Frog being 1.09 +/- 0.33 frogs/ha and that of the Bull Frog 0.46 +/- 0.11 frog/ha, respectively. It is concluded that both frog species are explosive breeders, i. e., their breeding activities were confined to the first showers of the monsoon season. The mean spawn weight of the Skittering Frog was 1.5 g with more than 1000 eggs in each spawn, while that of the Bull Frog was 0.26 g with less than 1000 eggs in a spawn. The spawning sites of the two species were investigated in detail. Generally, no threat to their populations was observed. However, the opening of the spillway of Rawal Dam following the torrential rain destroyed the breeding sites of the frogs. It is maintained that the event did not produce any significant impact on their populations and breeding as the two species were quite common.

It is more than 21 m deep and contains 18 m of lacustrine sediments. The Lateglacial sediments in the central parr of the lake consist of 2.7 m (from 15 to 17.7 m) of sapropelic and silty muds which are mostly laminated and partly bioturbated. Minor slumps occur mainly during colder phases. The subdivision of the Lateglacial is based on pollen zones. Multidisciplinary studies of the microfacies from thin sections, geochemistry, pollen analysis and rotifer analysis allow environmental and palaeoclimatological interpretations to be made. The biozones of the Lateglacial and their boundaries are marked by rapid climatic changes. Though covering comparatively short periods of time, they are not monotonous but characterized by minor internal climatic fluctuations. The sediments of the Meiendorf and Oldest Dryas are not laminated. The Allerod sediment is seasonally varved without interruption and encompasses 625 yr. The eruption of the Laacher-See volcano (12,900 cat BP) had an impact on the climate during the following 10 yr. The transition from the Allerod to the Younger Dryas took some 50 yr and it occurred 200 yr after the eruption of the Laacher See volcano. The abrupt change at the end of the Lateglacial (11,560 cal BP) occurred within less than 10 yr; however, many proxies reacted with a time lapse of 15 to 30 yr.

Light attraction could be an effective way of increasing trap catches, but research results are largely lacking. Experiments to test the effect of LED lights in trap-net fishing were conducted in two Finnish lakes where fishing targeted Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis L. and roach Rutilus rutilus (L.). LED lights (white, green, red, blue and combinations) were attached inside the traps. The use of LED lights did not increase fish CPUE. Contrary to expectation, Eurasian perch catches were higher in traps without LED lights. Significant variation in CPUEs was observed, but without interaction with light treatments. The LED lights tested in this study do not increase the effectiveness of trap fishery targeting Eurasian perch and roach in Finnish lakes in the ice-free season.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2021	28	3					211	218		10.1111/fme.12482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12482		MAY 2021											WOS:000646508100001

Samples were taken in May, July and October in 2000-2001. Studies focused on abundance and species diversity of phytophilous fauna of Stratiotes aloides, in particular on the relation between epiphytic and mining organisms and their seasonal changes. The studied zoocenosis differed significantly in terms of density and taxa number. In all studied seasons fauna inhabiting,Stratiotes aloides showed higher abundance and Species diversity than mining invertebrates. Both zoocenosis were predominated by Chironomidae larvae. The percentage of midges in epiphytic fauna decreased slightly during vegetation period, the mining fauna showed the opposite Pattern. Epiphytic Chironomidae were dominated by four taxa (Dicrotendipes sp., Glyptotendipes sp., Paratanytarsus austriacus, Psectrocladius sp.). The mining fauna was represented mainly by Glyptotendipes sp. larvae. Density and biomass of epiphytic fauna showed the positive correlation with water soldier biomass.					; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944; 													1505-2249						2006	54	3					441	451																WOS:000241466800014
J	Dedual, M; Pickford, M				Dedual, Michel; Pickford, Michael			The demand for angling licenses: A case study from Taupo, New Zealand	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Lake Taupo is managed as a wild trout fishery funded entirely by the sale of angling licenses. Since 1986 license sales have more than halved and this study aimed to identify the factors driving this trend. We used an economic demand theory framework in which to estimate least squares multiple regression models of license sales for the 45-year period 1970/71-2014/15. Using first-differenced data to avoid multicollinearity, we found that the sale of each license type (i.e., adult day, week, month and season, and child day and season) was influenced by its own price and the prices of substitutes, together with a variable to measure the overall interest in Taupo angling - the total license sales to population ratio. In a separate model, we found that this ratio was primarily influenced by various measures of the quality of the fishing, together with the unemployment rate. Other variables used widely in the literature to explain declining angling participation, such as development, income, urbanisation, changing leisure interests, and demographic changes, were not statistically significant. We discuss the implications of our results for the management of the fishery.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				AUG	2018	204						289	296		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.023													WOS:000432768000031
J	Jo, IH; Jeen, SW				Jo, In-Hwan; Jeen, Sung-Wook			Measurement of groundwater-surface water exchange rates using seepage meters: A case study of Deokjin Pond in Jeonju-si	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA												Groundwater and surface water are interacting, and particularly during droughty periods the contribution of groundwater to surface water is increased as a base flow. However, there have not been many quantitative studies in Korea for the exchange rates of groundwater and surface water. In this study, seepage meters were manufactured for direct measurements of the exchange rates, which were regularly measured at Deokjin Pond in Jeonju-si from March to August 2017. Measurements were made once or twice a week for most periods of time, but every one or two days during the rainy season between July 3 and 10, 2017. The measured exchange rates were correlated to the lake level of Deokjin Pond and the average precipitation during the measurement period. The results showed that the exchange rate is closely correlated to the lake level of Deokjin Pond, and also correlated to the average precipitation during the measurement period. The total exchange rate in Deokjin Pond was calculated as -0.869 to + 1.043 L/s. The measurement of the exchange rate using seepage meters in this study can be an important means of measuring groundwater base flow and thus contribute to understanding the interactions between groundwater and surface water.

Nevertheless, limited information is available about this Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem, including its food-web structure and complexity. In this study, we analysed the trophic interactions among dominant organisms in the food web of this Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem and assessed the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources during the wet season using delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis. The results supported the hypothesis that the food web of the Zoige Alpine wetland is largely maintained by allochthonous carbon sources rather than autochthonous food sources during the wet season when the allochthonous resource availability is relatively high. The food web contains approximately three trophic levels, and Schizopygopsis pylzovi (a genus of cyprinid fish) is the top predator. Intermediate trophic positions, including zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, represent the primary animal community in the food web. The allochthonous carbon sources are transferred to the food web via these macroinvertebrates (e.g., Ecdyonurus sp. and Sigara substriata). Although our findings show a low biodiversity in the Zoige wetland during the wet season, the trophic redundancy in the food-web structure could support the stability of the Zoige Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem.

COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES OF DACTYLOGYRUS SPP. IN WILD AND FARMED GOLDFISH CARASSIUS AURATUS	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Species composition and diversity of dactylogyrids were compared on gills of wild and cultured goldfish (silver crucian carp) Carassius auratus from 3 naturally populated lakes and 3 stocked aquaculture ponds in the Hubei province of China to examine the differences in the gill parasite community between these natural and farmed waters. Of the 7 Dactylogyrus spp. detected, all were found in lakes and 5 in ponds, with Dactylogyrus inexpectatus and Dactylogyrus anchoratus being absent from ponds. No significant correlation was found between the species richness and habitat area or host size, nor was there a significant difference in mean species richness between lakes (0.41-0.65) and ponds (0.30-0.76). Brillouin's diversity in lakes (0.049-0.067) was higher than that in ponds (0.024-0.046), but not significantly so. Although the diversity of parasite communities was higher in wild goldfish, higher mean abundance of some Dactylogyrus spp. was found in cultured goldfish. Based on Bray-Curtis similarity, it was difficult to differentiate parasite communities in lakes from those in ponds at the infracommunity level, whereas the 3 lakes and Guanqiao pond differed markedly from the remaining 2 ponds at the component community level. Although infracommunities differed among waterbodies, no effects of fish length or waterbody type were found on infracommunity or component community structure. Together, these results suggest that abundance and species richness of Dactylogyrus spp. on goldfish in lakes and farm ponds are influenced by habitat-specific environmental factors.

J	Wu, SK; Xie, P; Wang, SB; Zhou, Q				Wu Shikai; Xie Ping; Wang Songbo; Zhou Qiong			Changes in the patterns of inorganic nitrogen and TN/TP ratio and the associated mechanism of biological regulation in the shallow lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												The changes of NH3-N, NO3-N, NO2-N and TN/TP were studied during growth and non-growth season in 33 subtropical shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There were significant positive correlations among all nutrient concentrations, and the correlations were better in growth season than in non-growth season. When TP > 0.1 mgL(-1), NH3-N increased sharply in non-growth season with increasing TP, and NO3-N increased in growth season but decreased in non-growth season with TP. These might be attributed to lower dissolved oxygen and low temperature in non-growth season of the hypereutrophic lakes, since nitrification is more sensitive to dissolved oxygen and temperature than anti nitrification. When 0.1 mgL(-1)> TP > 0.035 mgL(-1), TN and all kinds of inorganic nitrogen were lower in growth season than in non-growth season, and phytoplankton might be the vital regulating factor. When TP < 0.035 mgL(-1), inorganic nitrogen concentrations were relatively low and NH3-N, NO2-N had significant correlations with phytoplankton, indicating that NH3-N and NO2-N might be limiting factors to phytoplankton. In addition, TN/TP went down with decline in TIP concentration, and TN and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were obviously lower in growth season than in non-growth season, suggesting that decreasing nitrogen (especially NH3-N and NO3-N) was an important reason for the decreasing TN/TP in growth season. The ranges of TN/TP were closely related to trophic level in both growth and non-growth seasons, and it is apparent that in the eutrophic and hypertrophic state the TN/TP ratio was obviously lower in growth season than in non-growth season. The changes of the TN/TP ratio were closely correlated with trophic levels, and both declines of TN in the water column and TP release from the sediment were important factors for the decline of the TN/TP ratio in growth season.

Pliocene climatic change and the origins of Homo at Ledi-Geraru, Ethiopia	ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY												Background: Long-term cooling and aridification are associated with the spread of grassland habitats and the appearance of new hominin adaptations starting in the late Miocene. However, limited fossil data during critical periods limits our ability to examine these climatic correlations further. Aim: We set out to reconstruct potential habitat and climate conditions at the origin of our genus Homo. Subjects and methodsMammalian faunal lists and species trait data were collected for Ledi-Geraru localities dated from similar to 2.78 to <2.59 million years ago (Ma). These were compared to a modern comparative dataset of mammal communities across Africa with known habitat and climate conditions, as well as to other fossil mammal data from eastern Africa in the time period leading up to and following shortly after the earliest known appearance of Homo at similar to 2.78 Ma. Results: Early Homo is associated with ongoing aridification and increasing seasonality in the Afar Depression. While climate trends in eastern Africa parallel global models, local environmental variation persisted across fossil-bearing regions. Conclusion: Climatic change (aridification and increasing seasonality) continues to be supported as a possible factor in the origins of our genus, although other fossil hominins continued to persist in these conditions.																			0301-4460	1464-5033				DEC 31	2025	52	1							2462255	10.1080/03014460.2025.2462255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014460.2025.2462255								40013589					WOS:001434163700001
J	Wang, F; Wang, XK; Zhao, Y				Wang, Fei; Wang, Xueke; Zhao, Ying			Effects of Intermittent Water Allocation on Vegetation Dynamics in Lake Baiyangdian, North China	WATER												The ecological effects of intermittent water supplement in Lake Baiyangdian were analyzed with an NDVI time series based on the data from 1 April 1998 to 31 July 2008. Four NDVI categories were extracted, and twelve stages were grouped based on the specific replenishment time of water allocation. STR (a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on regression) and its corresponding linear regression and abrupt change detection were used to highlight the temporal variations in vegetation under the effects of water allocation. ANOVA was used to identify the response quality of the vegetation in each stage. The results showed that the significant increasing trend of each NDVI category was detected by linear regression (p < 0.001). The 95% abrupt change intervals showed uncertainty and complexity in the immediate vegetation response to water division times. The most abrupt changes were detected in the growing seasons. The extremely significant differences in NDVI variation before and after water allocations were detected by ANOVA (p < 0.001, t-test). The longer the duration of water allocation was maintained, the higher the detection of vegetation coverage was relatively. The increased vegetation coverage benefited from the constant water supply. Our results provide evidence of vegetation responses to intermittent water divisions. The positive effects of water allocation on regional ecological restoration were confirmed. This study strengthened the water division effects of regional vegetation restoration and provided a practical strategy for an effective implementation of water allocation.					; Wang, Xintong/JJE-1189-2023	ZHAO, Ying/0000-0002-3869-0890; 														2073-4441				MAY	2021	13	10							1400	10.3390/w13101400	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13101400													WOS:000655144500001

The fish were first generation progeny from wild parents, and had spent their entire lives in captivity in either sea or fresh water. No differences in movement or behaviour patterns were observed between freshwater and seawater reared groups. Fish released in the lower river early (35 to 80 days prior to the natural spawning period) moved into a lake low in the system, and most stayed there near the commercial hatchery where they had been reared from egg to smolt. During the spawning season, none moved to the upper river reaches where most spawning habitat exists. Most broodstock released in the upper river reaches near the time of spawning stayed there during the spawning period. The following year few to no Atlantic salmon fry were found, and most appeared not to be offspring of released adults. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Calcareous rock outcrop vegetation of eastern North America (Exclusive of the Nashville Basin), with particular reference to use of the term "cedar glades"	BOTANICAL REVIEW												The term "cedar glades" has been applied to several different types of plant communities that occur on rocky calcareous soils in eastern North America. A previous paper by the first two authors reviewed in considerable detail the use of this term with regard to type of vegetation on rocky limestone soils in the Nashville (Central) Basin of Tennessee. The present paper reviews use of "cedar glades" as a descriptive term for vegetation in other physiographic regions of eastern North America. In the Nashville Basin, and in some other physiographic regions, the term has been applied to true open cedar glades ("glades") plus the surrounding redcedar/redcedar-hardwood forest, or (more recently) to the natural rocky treeless openings only. However, outside the Nashville Basin, it has also been used to describe several other disparate vegetation types, such as xeric limestone prairies (limestone glades, prairie barrens), redcedar-little bluestem savanna, dense redcedar forest, redcedar-hardwood forest, and even an open stand of redcedar-pine-sweetgum with warm-season perennial prairie grasses in the understory. In the Great Lakes region of North America and in the Baltic region of Europe, some alvars are similar to cedar glades sensu stricto of southeastern United States. Since many of the rocky calcareous openings in eastern North America can be classified as either cedar glades or xeric limestone prairies, a suite of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic-related factors is presented for use in distinguishing between these two vegetation types.																			0006-8101	1874-9372				OCT-DEC	2007	73	4					303	325		10.1663/0006-8101(2007)73[303:CROVOE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1663/0006-8101(2007)73[303:CROVOE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252488600004

Effects of colonizing predators on yellow perch (Perca flavescens) populations in lakes recovering from acidification and metal stress	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined the effects of predator species on yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from lakes in the Sudbury mining region (Ontario, Canada), where fish communities are just beginning to recover from the effects of decades of acidification and metal stress. The predation regimes investigated included six lakes with no predators, four lakes recently invaded (>= 15 years) by predators, and eight lakes with well-established ( >= 15 years) predator populations. Netting survey results indicated that yellow perch biomass was 69% lower in lakes with predators. In lakes recently invaded by predators, perch displayed earlier ontogenetic diet shifts from zooplankton to benthos and much poorer growth during their first growing season. Energy investment (lipid content per egg) in eggs by mature females was also less in the lakes recently invaded by predators. Growth potential in adult perch (age 1), estimated by nucleoside diphosphokinase, was highest in lakes with established predators. Body condition, controlling for size of perch, was also greatest in established predator lakes. Perch body shape in lakes with predators showed a shift from a typical streamlined, pelagic body form towards a deeper-bodied benthic body form, a change that may increase foraging efficiency for benthos or represent an antipredator strategy.					; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2007	64	10					1413	1428		10.1139/F07-097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-097													WOS:000251023700011

Climatic impacts of historical wetland drainage in Switzerland	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The effects of historical land-use and land-cover changes on the climate of the Swiss Plateau in the different seasons were investigated. In the 19th century, a civil engineering project was initiated to reshape the lake and river system on the Swiss Plateau in order to ban the frequent flooding during extreme weather events. The landscape modifications consisted primarily of a conversion of wetlands with extended peat soils into a highly productive agricultural landscape. Historical maps (1800-1850) served as a basis for the reconstruction of the past land use. The "Lokal-Modell" of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling was used to conduct eight one-month long high-resolution simulations (1.5 x 1.5 km(2)) with present and past landscape conditions. The modified soil and surface properties led to distinctly altered energy and moisture exchanges at the surface and as a consequence affected the local and regional climate. The climatic changes show different characteristics and magnitudes in the cold (October - March) as compared to the warm season (April - September). The landscape modifications led to an average daytime cooling between -0.12 degrees C (January) and -0.61 degrees C (April) and a night-time warming of 0.19 degrees C-0.34 degrees C. The differences in the mean monthly temperatures show a warming of 0.1 degrees C-0.2 degrees C in the cold season and a cooling of similar magnitude in most of the study area in the warm season. The modification of the radiation budget and the surface energy balance distinctly affected the convective activity in the study area in the warm season, but had only a weak effect on convectivity in the cold season. The cloud coverage in the warm season is therefore distinctly reduced compared to the past.					; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010	Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				FEB	2007	80	3-4					301	321		10.1007/s10584-006-9120-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-006-9120-8													WOS:000243803300008

The ciliates showed a bimodal seasonal pattern with abundances peaking early and late in the hydroperiods, and the communities showed a strong seasonal succession of species only 15% of the 162 ciliate species were present throughout the hydroperiods. Less than half of the species occurred in both ponds. Adding riparian leaf litter to large pond enclosures affected several physicochemical variables, increased bacterial abundance, and promoted the appearance of particular species-many of which are known to be associated with nutrient- or organic matter-enriched conditions. This treatment resulted in higher ciliate abundance (mainly small-sized bacterivores) and lower ciliate diversity in mid-hydroperiod in one of the ponds. The removal of plant litter generally produced effects in the physicochemical variables that were opposite to those seen in the leaf litter addition, and resulted in a 15% decrease in the proportion of ciliate bacterivores in one pond. The effects of top-down manipulations (i.e. prevention of aerial colonization of insects) were minor. Many treatment effects were season-, and pond-specific. The measured environmental variables (including pond and treatments) explained half of the variation in ciliate abundance, one-third of the species diversity, and one-fifth of the species composition. Pond characteristics and the leaf litter additions were the most important factors for determining ciliate abundance (together with chlorophyll a), diversity (together with dissolved oxygen), and community composition (together with season).																			0948-3055	1616-1564				MAR 29	2006	42	3					293	310		10.3354/ame042293	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame042293													WOS:000237243000008

Seasonal Distribution of Cyanobacteria in Three Urban Eutrophic Lakes Results from an Epidemic-like Response to Environmental Conditions	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial communities of three co-located eutrophic sandpit lakes were surveyed during 2016 and 2017 over season and depth using high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All three lakes were stratified except during April 2017 when the lakes were recovering from a strong mixing event. 16S rRNA gene V4 sequences were parsed into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 99% sequence identity. After rarefaction of 139 samples to 25,000 sequences per sample, a combined total of 921,529 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified as cyanobacteria. They were binned into 19,588 unique cyanobacterial OTUs. Of these OTUs, 11,303 were Cyanobium. Filamentous Planktothrix contributed 1537 and colonial Microcystis contributed 265. The remaining 6482 OTUs were considered unclassified. For Planktothrix and Microcystis one OTU accounted for greater than 95% of the total sequences for each genus. However, in both cases the non-dominant OTUs clustered with the dominant OTUs by date, lake, and depth. All Planktothrix OTUs and a single Cyanobium OTU were detected below the oxycline. All other Cyanobium and Microcystis OTUs were detected above the oxycline. The distribution of Cyanobium OTUs between lakes and seasons can be explained by an epidemic-like response where individual OTUs clonally rise from a diverse hypolimnion population when conditions are appropriate. The importance of using 99% identity over the more commonly used 97% is discussed with respect to cyanobacterial community structure. The approach described here can provide another valuable tool for assessing cyanobacterial populations and provide greater insight into the controls of cyanobacterial blooms.					; Forshay, Kenneth/P-3649-2015	Devereux, Richard/0000-0002-1246-7607; James, Joseph/0000-0001-6985-2023													0343-8651	1432-0991				JUN	2021	78	6					2298	2316		10.1007/s00284-021-02498-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02498-6		APR 2021						33904973					WOS:000644835300004
J	Koperski, P				Koperski, Pawel			Relative importance of factors determining diversity and composition of freshwater leech assemblages (Hirudinea; Clitellata): a metaanalysis	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Data on numbers and percentages of leech species sampled in 55 Polish freshwater environments were analysed. Most of these data were published between 1951-1998. The first aim of the present study was to recognize the most important ecological factors affecting the diversity and taxonomic composition of leech assemblages in Polish waters. Evaluating the relative importance of these factors in explaining diversity and composition of the leech fauna was the second aim. The significance of six factors, potentially affecting the composition and diversity of the leech fauna was tested. These were: type of environment, size of environment, geographical location, presence of fish predation, sampling season and level of degradation. Two factors were found to be important determinants of the leech assemblage composition. The first were the specific properties of the ponds. Occurrence and percentages of certain leech species therein were significantly different from those in lakes. The second factor was the presence of fish or the intensity of fish predation. No significant differences in occurrence or percentages of species were found between geographic regions, habitat size and samples collected in various seasons. Lakes were the richest environments in terms of species number. The high mortality caused by sampling of leeches in small, semi-isolated ponds or in lakes localized in protected areas is discussed. Surprisingly, significantly lower species diversity was observed in environments with more intense fish predation.

J	Läuchli, B; Augustinus, PC; Peti, L; Hopkins, JL				Lauchli, Benjamin; Augustinus, Paul Christian; Peti, Leonie; Hopkins, Jenni Louise			Composite development and stratigraphy of the Onepoto maar lake sediment sequence (Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand)	SCIENTIFIC DRILLING												The accurate and precise reconstruction of Quaternary climate as well as the events that punctuate it is an important driver of the study of lake sediment archives. However, until recently lake sediment-based palaeoclimate reconstructions have largely concentrated on Northern Hemisphere lake sequences due to a scarcity of continuous and high-resolution lake sediment sequences from the Southern Hemisphere, especially from the southern mid-latitudes. In this context, the deep maar lakes of the Auckland Volcanic Field of northern New Zealand are significant as several contain continuous and well-laminated sediment sequences. Onepoto Basin potentially contains the longest temporal lake sediment record from the Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF), spanning from Marine Isotope Stage 6e (MIS 6e) to the early Holocene when lacustrine sedimentation was terminated by marine breach of the south-western crater tuff ring associated with post-glacial sea-level rise. The Onepoto record consists of two new, overlapping cores spanning ca. 73m combined with archive material in a complete composite stratigraphy. Tephrochronology and C-14 dating provide the fundamental chronological framework for the core, with magnetic relative palaeo-intensity variability downcore, and meteoric Be-10 influx into the palaeolake to refine the chronology. The mu-XRF (micro X-ray fluorescence) downcore variability for the entirety of the lake sediment sequence has been established with measurement of a range of proxies for climate currently underway.

Impact of metal pollution, food availability, and excessive fishing on Rhabdosargus haffara stock (family: Sparidae) in Timsah lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH					International Conference on Integrated Management of Environment (ICIME)	SEP 25-28, 2014	Hammamet, TUNISIA					The lakes' fisheries play an important role in Egyptian economy. In 1980s, they provided more than 50 % of harvested fish in Egypt but now their contribution to the Egypt fish production decreased to only 12.5 % in 2012. Lake Timsah, one of the Suez Canal lakes, faced many challenges that lead to serious changes in its water and fish quality, fish production, as well as the catch composition. The present work investigated the impact of pollution, food availability, and excessive fishing mortality on the haffara production in lake Timsah. The distribution of four heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Ni, and Fe) was detected seasonally in water and in muscles, gills, and livers of Rhabdosargus haffara, during 2012 through 2013. Fe and Zn were presented by high values in liver, while Pb and Ni in gills. Generally, the lowest concentrations of all metals were found in muscles. The recorded crustacean organisms (the main food of haffara) decreased from 12 species and 32,079 organismsa"m(2) in 2012 to only 7 species and 7290 organismsa"m(2) in 2013 while the amphipods completely disappeared. This serious change was due to the severe pollution in the lake. A logistic surplus production model was fitted to the catch per unit effort indices, to estimate the maximum sustainable yield and the optimum level of fishing effort. The results revealed that haffara stock at lake Timsah is overfished, and the estimated precautionary target reference points advised the reduction of fishing effort by about 30-50 %.

Four sampling sites were selected in the littoral region of Lake Egirdir. Macrophytes were taken seasonally from July 2012 to April 2013. Submerged samples (Myriophyllum spicatum L., Potamogeton perfoliatus L., Ceratophylum sp. and Valisneria sp.) were collected for the analysis of epiphytic algae. Twenty-four diatom species were identified in this study. Cocconeis pediculus Ehrenberg was identified as the most abundant epiphytic diatom on the Myriophyllum spicatum L., Potamogeton perfoliatus L., Ceratophylum sp. and Valisneria sp. Besides, physical and chemical parameters of lake water were determined. Water temperature, pH and conductivity varied from 6.9 - 26.3 degrees C, 8.9-9.1, 276.1 - 388.1 mu S/cm, dissolved oxygen values as 11.8 - 9.7 mg l(-1) respectively. Concentration of calcium, magnesium, silicon, nitrate and phosphate ranged 41.3-32.1, 36.5- 41.3, 5.7 -6.1, 1.1- 3.4 and 0.02- 0.43 mg l(-1), respectively. It was concluded that wave motions in aquatic environments and water quality parameters are primarily effective in the distribution of epiphytic diatoms, seasons are important in the development of some species, and macrophytes provide support for the species to attach to the surfaces according to their morphological differences, despite not being very determinative.																			0556-3321	2070-3368				AUG	2016	48	4					1723	1730																WOS:000387737500051
J	Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR				Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR			Variations of sensible and latent heat fluxes from a Great Lakes buoy and associated synoptic weather patterns	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												An investigation of sensible and latent heat fluxes and their relation to synoptic weather events was performed using hourly meteorological measurements from National Data Buoy Center buoy 45003, located in northern Lake Huron, during April-November of 1984. Two temporal heat flux regimes were found to exist over Lake Huron. The first period extended from April through July and was characterized by periods of modest negative (downward) heat fluxes. The second regime was marked by periods of large positive (upward) heat fluxes and occurred from August through November. This later period accounted for 95%-100% of both the total positive sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, a comparison of the seasonal evolution of sensible and latent heat fluxes showed the transition from the negative to the positive flux regime occurred 10-20 days earlier for latent heat flux than for sensible heat flux. A notable, statistically significant increase of the surface heat flux variability from the negative to positive flux regimes with a general decrease in the near-surface atmospheric stability during the positive flux regime was found. During both flux regimes, the magnitude of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes remained coupled to transient synoptic-scale weather events. On average, the occurrences of minimum (maximum) heat fluxes preceded time periods of low (high) sea level pressure by 0-3 h during the negative flux regime. For the positive flux regime, maximum (minimum) surface heat fluxes followed the passage of low (high) pressure by approximately 24 h. In addition, maximum (minimum) sensible and latent heat fluxes preceded synoptic high (low) pressure by approximately 16 h. Typical synoptic surface weather patterns were identified for both significant positive and negative heat flux events, time periods when the atmosphere-lake heat exchange was maximized.

Three cores from within the territory of the classical city Sagalassos (Western Taurus, Pisidia) were palynologically analysed to make a reconstruction of the past vegetation in the territory of Sagalassos and to estimate the impact of its inhabitants on the landscape in Pisidia. Two cores originate from an intramontane marsh (Gravgaz; elevation 1215 m) and one from a seasonal intramontane lake (Canakh; elevation 1030 m). Human acitivity is apparent from c. 2530 BP in the pollen diagrams. A deforestation phase/'disturbance' phase (from c. 2530 BP/c. 2480 BP till c. 2280 BP/c. 2270 BP), anthropogenically or climatologically driven, precedes a cultivation period (arboricultural phase) (from c. 2280 BP/2270 BP till c. 1480 BP/c. 1270 BP). The results of the pollen analyses of the three cores are compared and show many similarities. There are also similarities with other cores from SW Turkey, although the arboricultural phase (mainly olive cultivation) occurs later in the cores from the Sagalassos territory than in other cores from SW Turkey.

Oxygen Depletion in Lake Waters May Skew brGDGT-Inferred Temperatures by More Than 10°C	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) paleothermometry is an important tool for paleoclimate research. Oxygen availability has been suggested to skew brGDGT-inferred temperatures, but the effect is poorly constrained. Here, we examine the influence of dissolved oxygen (DO) on brGDGTs in lacustrine water filtrates. By examining three subgroups of samples collected within narrow temperature ranges, we more effectively isolate the influence of DO. We find significant correlations between DO and the MBT ' 5Me temperature index in all three constant-temperature subgroups. Underlying shifts in key brGDGT abundances indicate the problem is likely to manifest in virtually all existing calibrations. The effects appear at even modest DO depletion, where existing anoxia biomarkers are unlikely to appear. Though creating a quantitative correction is not straightforward, we estimate maximum DO-driven temperature offsets. These observations highlight a large and hitherto unquantified source of uncertainty in brGDGT-based paleotemperature reconstructions and underscore the need for further research.

The sites investigated are Iron Age crannogs (lake dwellings) which have a proven waterlogged archaeological component, and which are being assessed as part of a national program of study by the Scottish Welland Archaeology Programme (SWAP) team. A monthly monitoring program commenced in July of 2004. To date, monitoring of water levels, pH, and redox potential, has been undertaken for a period of 17 months in order to encompass any seasonal variability at the sites studied. The results have proven robust in that an 'ideal' site for in situ preservation has been identified from the five sites investigated, and the monitoring has highlighted external variables and seasonal impacts that have the potential to influence the long-term in situ preservation at the remaining sites studied. In general, these results have expanded upon our knowledge of the potential for the preservation of existing archaeological remains within such contexts. This study represents the first stage of monitoring aimed at developing a holistic understanding of in situ conditions at the crannog sites studied in southwest Scotland. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	DiStefano, RJ; Gale, CM; Wagner, BA; Zweifel, RD				DiStefano, RJ; Gale, CM; Wagner, BA; Zweifel, RD			A sampling method to assess lotic crayfish communities	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Crayfish are widely recognized as an important ecological component of stream systems, but there has been limited work to develop and evaluate the reliability of sampling methods for lotic crayfishes, especially efforts that are temporally and spatially comprehensive. We desired a quantitative method to assess crayfish communities in streams with rocky substrate. Our objective was to develop a method to obtain and compare representative density estimates with acceptable variance and reasonable effort, and to illustrate use of the method by using it to 1) describe and compare diurnal habitat associations by lotic crayfish, and 2) detect density changes over time. Our study encompassed four sites on two rivers, two seasons, and 8 y (1991-1998) to evaluate a 1-m(2) quadrat sampler, and a sampling method that stratified effort among five macrohabitats to reduce variability. This method performed well for both seasons, detecting spatial differences among macrohabitats and temporal differences among years. Spatial differences were expressed as macrohabitat selectivity by the crayfish community, and showed a consistent trend across streams and seasons. In particular, macrohabitats with slower current velocities consistently had the highest densities. Temporal differences included documentation of decreased densities in several macrohabitats across 5 y. Sampling precision, measured by coefficients of variation, was acceptable but not considered high. Statistical power was good for detecting spatial differences, but reduced and variable for detecting temporal changes. Our findings 1) demonstrate the use of stratifying quantitative sampling for lotic crayfish communities by habitats, 2) confirm the importance of evaluating sampling methods, and 3) illustrate the consistent way in which Ozarks crayfish communities used available macrohabitats.																			0278-0372					AUG	2003	23	3					678	690		10.1651/C-2364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1651/C-2364													WOS:000184295900014
J	Morrill, C; Koch, PL				Morrill, C; Koch, PL			Elevation or alteration? Evaluation of isotopic constraints on paleoaltitudes surrounding the Eocene Green River Basin	GEOLOGY												Low oxygen isotope values (similar to-16parts per thousand, relative to Peedee belemnite standard) obtained from microbial carbonates of the Green River Formation have been interpreted as evidence for snowmelt and high elevations surrounding this early Eocene lake basin. However, low values from microbial precipitates could also represent a diagenetic overprint. We investigate these alternate hypotheses by measuring the oxygen isotope composition of altered and unaltered freshwater bivalves from the basin. We analyzed subannual samples from 3 individuals and bulk samples from 54 individuals. Subannual samples exhibit clear seasonal fluctuations in oxygen isotope values. These fluctuations are large enough to require seasonal shifts in temperature and/or the oxygen isotope value of the lake water. However, the lowest value of any unaltered sample (either bulk or high resolution) corresponds to lake-water delta(18)O of similar to-12parts per thousand (relative to standard mean ocean water) and is not low enough to require the addition of snowmelt to the lake. A few bulk samples exhibit very low oxygen isotope values, which would seem to suggest snowmelt. However, these samples also show clear evidence of calcite in X-ray diffraction patterns, demonstrating the presence of diagenetic precipitates. Given that (1) diagenetic alteration is a plausible explanation of very low delta(18)O values, (2) alteration has not been examined in microbial carbonates, and (3) unaltered aragonitic bivalves provide no independent evidence for low delta(18)O values for lake waters, we conclude that robust isotopic evidence for high elevations surrounding the Green River Basin during the Eocene is currently lacking.

J	Are, F; Reimnitz, E				Are, F; Reimnitz, E			An overview of the Lena River Delta setting: Geology, tectonics, geomorphology, and hydrology	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Lena River Delta, largest in the Arctic, occupies 32,000 km(2). It has a complicated structure caused by neoitectonic block-movements, which formed an island archipelago with elevation differences as large as 60 m of distinct geological units. The modern active delta occupies spaces between older islands of the archipelago, and is just beginning to protrude into the open sea. The hydrologic pattern in the delta also shows the influence of tectonism. Numerous earthquakes during last century with magnitudes as large as 6 suggest that tectonic movement is continuing. Radiocarbon dating shows that the modern delta has been built during the second half of the Holocene. The total advance of the delta during this time was 120-150 km. The Lena River is considered the main sediment source for the Laptev Sea. The latest investigations give the suspended sediment load in the lower Lena River at 21 Mt/y, but only < 30% of this load is thought to reach the sea. The bed load transport is considerable but its value is unknown. The active sub-aerial delta is bordered by a shallow platform as wide as 18 km, which turns into a relatively steep slope at the 2 m isobath. This feature, corresponding in depth to the thickness of the seasonal ice cover, is observed only off Arctic rivers and is not understood. Some sections of the modern delta have morphological features characteristic for advancing shores, others show signs of retreat. However no measurements of delta shore dynamics are available. Thus the general direction of the process is disputable. The western part of the Lena Delta is formed by a large, 20-m-high sand island fringed by a unique lace coast formed by narrow estuary-like bays deeply penetrating the land. This unique coast undergoes intensive erosion not only on promontories but also inside of estuaries due to storm surges reaching to >2 m height. The sand island is characterized by typical lake-thermokarst relief, but no volumes of underground ice large enough to explain this relief are known. The elongated lake depressions and lakes are oriented about 2-8 degrees True. In the middle of generally 1- to a-m-deep lakes are equally oriented hollows as deep as 25 m. The lakes are degrading because of erosion by stream channels draining them. The lake-thermokarst relief on the north slope of the island is partly or totally destroyed by erosion processes. Thus the Lena Delta is characterized by several unique features that are either poorly understood or unexplained.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2000	16	4					1083	1093																WOS:000165935500011

The Permian-Triassic boundary is marked by the extinction of glossopterid and cordaitalean gymnosperms, and by the disappearance or extreme decline of a range of gymnospermous and pteridophytic palynomorph groups. Earliest Triassic macrofloras and palynofloras of the Flagstone Bench Formation are dominated by peltasperms and lycophytes; corystosperms, conifers, and ferns become increasingly common elements of assemblages through the Lower Triassic part of the formation and dominate floras of the Upper Triassic strata. The sedimentary transition across this boundary is conformable but marked by a termination of coal deposits; overlying lowermost Triassic sediments contain only carbonaceous siltstones. Typical red-bed facies are not developed until at least 100 m above the base of the Flagstone Bench Formation, in strata containing ?Middle Triassic palynofloras. Across Gondwana the diachronous disappearance of coal deposits and appearance of red-beds is suggestive of a response to shifting climatic belts, resulting in progressively drier seasonal conditions at successively higher palaeolatitudes during the Late Permian to Middle Triassic. The abrupt and approximately synchronous replacement of plant groups at the Permian-Triassic boundary suggests that factors independent of, or additional to, climate change were responsible for the turnover in terrestrial floras.					; Lindström, Sofie/G-5481-2018	DRINNAN, ANDREW/0000-0003-0087-1714; Lindstrom, Malin Sofie/0000-0001-8278-1055													0954-1020					SEP	1997	9	3					281	298		10.1017/S0954102097000370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102097000370													WOS:A1997XV76100008

Fifteen samples of water were collected from Bendimahi River and Van Lake for two seasons in 2005. Water samples were analyzed for eight trace elements and concluded together with gross-alpha and gross-beta radioactivity concentrations. Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used to determine the concentrations of heavy metals in water samples collected from Bendimahi River basin. Correlation analysis was made for radioactivity and heavy metal concentrations and the Pearson correlation coefficients between gross-alpha and gross-beta radioactivity and heavy metal were determined. The concentrations of all metals were found to be higher than WHO, EC, EPA and TSE-266 guidelines for drinking water, except for Zn and Cu. Generally, the heavy metal concentrations in water samples obtained in May and in August were found to be in sequence of Fe>Zn>Pb>Cr>Cu>Mn>Co>Cd and Fe>Zn>Cu>Pb>Cr>Mn>Co>Cd, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the highresolution spatial and temporal variations in water quality parameters across different regions of Lake Dian (including Caohai and Waihai) and its major inflowing rivers, as well as to objectively assess its pollution status and future trends. Comprehensive experiments and field measurements were conducted at 150 high-resolution sampling points. The analyzed parameters included total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), water temperature (WT), and other physicochemical indicators. Spatial interpolation, correlation analysis, and time-series modeling were employed to explore the distribution patterns and interaction mechanisms of these parameters. Results revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations across Lake Dian. Nutrient gradients followed the order: Caohai > Waihai, bottom water > surface water, and nearshore estuarine areas > central lake regions, with an overall pollution pattern decreasing from north to south. Phytoplankton blooms exhibited distinct seasonal and spatial clustering, predominantly occurring from May to October, with hotspots concentrated in Caohai, northern Waihai, and shallow bays. Chl-a concentrations showed significant positive correlations with WT, dissolved oxygen (DO), and TN, indicating that algal growth is driven by multiple factors, with phosphorus playing a more prominent role during the rainy season. Comparative analysis of national monitoring data (from March 1979 to June 2023) and laboratory results identified three distinct phases in the evolution of water quality: "deterioration, improvement, and fluctuation". TN and TP concentrations reached their peaked between 1989 and 2009, with average values of 3.58 +/- 0.98 mg/ L and 0.35 +/- 0.06 mg/L, respectively. Although water quality has shown improvement since 2010, the water environment remains unstable, particularly during the rainy season when nutrient concentrations exceed threshold levels (TN: 0.3 mg/L, TP: 0.02 mg/L). After years of sustained management and restoration efforts, water quality in Lake Dian has gradually improved, and eutrophication has been partially alleviated. However, high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations continue to present complex and persistent challenges for eutrophication and pollution control, necessitating ongoing attention. External nutrient inputs remain a critical concern, while internal nutrient release from sediment also requires rigorous monitoring and management.

This study proposes an integrated framework combining optical water type (OWTs) classification and ensemble learning algorithms to enhance the re- mote sensing retrieval accuracy of Chl-a in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake during 2020-2023, particularly during the extreme drought event of 2022. Firstly, K-means clustering combined with spectral feature analysis was used to classify both lakes into four distinct OWTs. Dongting Lake classifications effectively separated phytoplankton-dominated waters (OWT1, OWT2, OWT4) from those dominated by non-algal suspended matter (OWT3). For Poyang Lake, classifications identified mixed water types (OWT1), frequent algal bloom areas (OWT2), high biomass phytoplankton areas (OWT3), and areas significantly masked by non-algal particles (OWT4). Further analysis indicated that OWT2 in Dongting Lake is prone to algal blooms, while OWT3 and OWT4 are dominated by non-algal particles. Secondly, the performance of ensemble learning methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting) was evaluated against traditional single models (SVR and BPNN). The results demonstrated the superior stability and predictive accuracy of the Voting strategy under low Chl-a conditions in Dongting Lake, achieving a maximum MAPE reduction of 84.76 %. Meanwhile, the Stacking method exhibited outstanding robustness in Poyang Lake's complex optical conditions, with RMSE reduced by up to 93.12 %. Additionally, hierarchical modeling based on OWT-specific ensemble methods significantly reduced errors compared to traditional global models, with decreases of 36 % in Dongting Lake and 42.19 % in Poyang Lake. Finally, this study revealed that the extreme drought event in the Yangtze River basin in 2022 significantly altered seasonal and interannual variations in the OWTs of Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. The drought led to lake shrinkage and increased dominance of non-algal suspended particles, highlighting the vulnerability of these connected lake ecosystems under extreme climatic conditions. The research emphasizes the importance of combining a lake-specific OWTs classification and advanced ensemble learning techniques for precise water quality assessment under dynamic environmental conditions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2025	177								113738	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113738													WOS:001512462900001

One mature, fully-filled kernel per accession was photographed dorsoventral side up with an Olympus TG-6 macro camera (4000 x 3000 px, 314 dpi, f/2.3, 1/13 s, +1 EV) under fixed laboratory lighting. Each frame includes a matte-green background, a 30 mm plastic ruler, and two printed fiducials, enabling pixel-to-millimeter scaling and consistent orientation. The repository is organized into four zip archives. grainimages.zip holds the 231 color JPEG photographs. landmarks.zip provides 231 plain-text tables listing the x,y coordinates of 30 homologous radial landmarks that capture length, width, curvature, tip geometry, shoulder position, awn insertion point, and subtle asymmetries. contours.zip contains 231 standalone PNG drawings showing a spline-interpolated outline reconstructed solely from each landmark set-no photographic background is included-facilitating rapid visual checks of digitization accuracy. scripts.zip contains all custom Python scripts for generating the landmark sets and reproducing the figures and tables presented in the paper. The dataset, available on Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15515366) under a CC BY 4.0 license, can be reused for landmark- or outline-based morphometric analysis, color and awn-length phenotyping, benchmarking of computer-vision pipelines, and instructional demonstrations of geometric morphometric workflows.																			2352-3409					AUG	2025	61								111781	10.1016/j.dib.2025.111781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2025.111781								40612480					WOS:001520682100001

Origin of conglomerate-hosted bonebeds at the base of the upper Permian Usili Formation, Ruhuhu Basin, Tanzania	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY												A diverse conglomerate-hosted fossil tetrapod assemblage occurs in a similar to 4 m-thick interval at the base of the upper Permian Usili Formation in the Ruhuhu Basin, Tanzania. The interval comprises three 0.5-1.5 m-thick erosively based fining-upward sequences. Each begins with a lenticular body of clast to matrix-supported conglomerate capped by a thin bed of massively bedded granule conglomerate and sharply overlain by fine-grained sandstone. Conglomerate intraclasts include abundant spheroidal carbonate nodules with septarian shrinkage cracks, rounded mudstone pebbles, scattered carbonate mud discs and fragments of stromatolitic limestone, all locally-to-regionally sourced from erosion of the underlying Ruhuhu Formation lacustrine and lake-plain deposits. Isolated cranial and postcranial elements of burnetiamorphs, dicynodonts, gorgonopsians, pareiasaurs, and temnospondyls occur scattered within the conglomerate and overlying gritstone beds, becoming abundant in the capping fine-grained sandstone along with silicified tree trunks. Significantly, most bones are preferentially encrusted with hematite, which suggests generally wet soil conditions with seasonal drying, and tree rings show the normal seasonal growth patterns of a humid temperate climate. The basal Usili conglomerates are attributed to a period of tectonic reorientation of the Ruhuhu rift bounding faults resulting in a basin-wide transition from deep lacustrine (upper Ruhuhu Formation) to alluvial plain with an episode of axial river incision and lateral alluvial fan progradation (basal Usili Formation) before subsidence increased to allow floodplain aggradation (lower-to-upper Usili Formation). Taphonomic signatures of most of the bones suggests they were sourced from carcasses lying exposed on terrace surfaces and in alluvial fan channels rather than from reworking of previously fossilized bones.																			0272-4634	1937-2809				JUL 31	2025	45			SUP1	SI				e2466442	10.1080/02724634.2025.2466442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2025.2466442													WOS:001545844800001

Wyatt			Changes in relative abundance of adult walleye and egg density following the addition of walleye spawning habitat in a midwest irrigation reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Cobble substrate for walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning was added at Sherman Reservoir, Nebraska, in January 2008. We evaluated changes in relative adult walleye abundance and egg density in response to the cobble substrate and estimated site fidelity of adult walleye during the spawning seasons of 2007, 2008, and 2009. A 15% increase in electrofishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of adult walleye was observed on the cobble substrate the first season it was available (2008), but a 5% decrease in electrofishing CPUE was observed the second season (2009) compared to the 2007 season. While gill nets were not run during the first season the cobble was available, a 113% increase in gill net CPUE was observed the second season. During the first season the cobble was available, a 215% increase in egg density was observed, but no increase in egg density was found in the second season. Site fidelity of adult walleye within a spawning season was 94% and was 81% between seasons. These results indicate that the addition of the cobble substrate increased the relative abundance of adult walleye and density of eggs on the cobble substrate.					; Small, Brian/I-3762-2012	Hoback, William/0000-0002-8927-9102; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2011	26	1					51	58		10.1080/02705060.2011.553828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.553828													WOS:000289598000007
J	Zenker, A; Baier, B				Zenker, Armin; Baier, Beate			Relevance of abiotic criteria used in German lake typology for macroinvertebrate fauna	HYDROBIOLOGIA												For lake characterisation, top-down typologies are mostly used throughout Europe, including type criteria such as climate, lake area, catchment geology and conductivity. In Germany, a lake typology was applied comprising ecoregion, calcium concentration, Schindler's ratio, stratification type and residence time. However, the relevance of these criteria for the macroinvertebrate fauna has not been conclusively demonstrated till now. Benthic invertebrate community data and related environmental parameters of pristine or near-pristine lakes in Germany were analysed by multivariate analysis techniques to elucidate which environmental parameters are reflected by invertebrate composition. Moreover, benthic invertebrate data were transformed to metrics expressing ecological attributes and species richness (summarising functional composition, diversity and sensitivity measures). Multivariate statistics were used to test whether information relevant to ordination was lost and whether variation decreases using metrics which combine data with ecological attributes. Analysis of lake-type criteria revealed that ecoregions and prevailing substrates were characterized by different taxonomic compositions of macroinvertebrates. In addition, a relationship was found between community composition and lake size. Creating a novel bottom-up lake typology based on ecoregions, lake size and prevailing substrate gives better separation of distinct macroinvertebrate communities and a higher level of homogeneity within groups compared to top-down typology or single environmental parameters alone, both on species and metrics data. Despite some data variation due to methodological differences (e.g. different sampling and sorting techniques) and interannual and seasonal variation in the data set, NMDS ordination presented well-separated groups of bottom-up lake types. Lake types were more precisely separated by species data than by metric data in both top-down and bottom-up typology. However, as information loss from species lists to calculated metrics is marginal, type-specific benthic invertebrate assemblages are reflected both on the species level and on the metric level. Species and metric data are both suitable for data ordination, while single environmental parameters affecting macroinvertebrate composition can best be obtained using metrics.

J	Kagoro-Rugunda, G				Kagoro-Rugunda, G			Crop raiding around Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In areas around Lake Mburo National Park, large wild animals wander in close proximity to human settlements. This poses serious conflict in terms of crop damage. The integration of conservation with other land uses is difficult where densely settled agricultural land surrounds a protected area potentially containing problem animals, as is the case for several parks in Africa and Asia. The intensity of crop raiding was quantified through the use of random crop quadrants/plots and area estimation techniques in a portion of raided fields. The animal species concerned were documented from observations, footprints and any other marks left behind. Three variables were tested as predictors of damage: human population density, distance from the park boundary and season. In this study, data is presented regarding crop loss in the different seasons of the year, analysis of crop damage variation and animal species involved in crop loss. A diverse assemblage of animals foraged on subsistence crops and analysis of crop damage revealed significant crop depreciation by wildlife.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2004	42	1					32	41		10.1111/j.0141-6707.2004.00444.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0141-6707.2004.00444.x													WOS:000220627900004
J	Market, PS; Halcomb, CE; Ebert, RL				Market, PS; Halcomb, CE; Ebert, RL			A climatology of thundersnow events over the contiguous United States	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												A "climatology'' (climatological description of spatial, temporal, and synoptic characteristics) of snow events with thunder is presented for the contiguous United States. Based upon 30 yr of 3-hourly reports from 204 stations in the 48 contiguous United States, 229 reports are extracted from the 3-hourly observations (consistently bearing the present-weather group in each surface observation) that featured thunder with snow only. When these reports are plotted spatially, the central United States, the intermountain west, and the Great Lakes region emerge as the preferred regions for thundersnow occurrence. A thundersnow event is then defined. Isolated thundersnow reports clearly constitute a thundersnow event. Also, multiple thundersnow reports that are not separated spatially by over 1100 km or temporally by 6 h are considered part of one event. The location reporting the first occurrence of thunder with snow in such a collection of stations then carries the representative time and location for the event. The 229 individual reports make up 191 thundersnow events. Temporal analysis of thundersnow events reveals a nationwide seasonal preference for occurrence in March but no clear diurnal preference. Most thundersnow events are typically reported at only one station and only rarely in consecutive 3-hourly observations. These results thus reinforce the notion of thundersnow as a fairly localized phenomenon of limited duration. In terms of intensity, the thundersnow events investigated in this study feature light snow about one-half of the time, with the remaining events split nearly evenly between moderate (25%) and heavy (23%) snowfall. Further analysis classifies each event according to the meso-to synoptic-scale environment in which it forms. Most events (52%) form in association with a transient midlatitude cyclone; other event types include an orographic class, events that occur with a coastal cyclone, events associated with an arctic front, lake-effect events, and those resulting from upslope flow.

The study villages are located in a Sudan savanna area. Malaria transmission is seasonal and peaks in September in these villages. Tensobtenga and Balonguen are comparables in all aspects, except the presence of an artificial lake and wetlands in Tensobtenga. The mosquitoes sampling sites were randomly selected, taking into consideration the number of potential breeding sites, and the number of households in each village. Three times a week during 12 mo mosquitoes were collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention light traps in sentinel sites. To assess the infectivity the mosquitoes double ELISAs tests were performed on thoraces of female Anopheles gambiae s.l. (Giles) and Anopheles funestus. A total of 54,392 female Anopheles., representing 92.71% of the total mosquitoes, were collected. The peaks of aggressiveness because of either An. gambiae s.l. or An. funestus were observed in September in each of the villages. However, these peaks were lower in Balonguen compared with Tensobtenga. Malaria cumulative aggressiveness and transmission intensity because of both species peaked in September in each of the two villages, with lower values in Balonguen in comparison to Tensobtenga. From February to May, malaria transmission intensity is negligible in Balonguen and <1 bite/person/mo is observed in Tensobtenga. These results have confirmed the marked seasonality of malaria transmission in the study area.						Tiono, B.

GLACIER RECEDING AND ECOLOGICAL THRESHOLDS FOR TIBETAN PLATEAU AND ASSOCIATED CRYOSPHERE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Mountain hazards are environmentally created and their strength changed with rigorousness of climatic factors. High alpine areas are usually covered with glaciers where atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and cryosphere including mankind interrelate. Climate change accelerations in 21st century and past assessments of the stressors how they affect ecosystems in the mountains of South Asia with observed and projected temperature and precipitations impacts and with a focus on plant ecology changes were examined. The ecological thresholds for biosphere is achieved when an alteration in the quality, singularity or features of an ecosystem produce large and persistence responses in an ecosystem. This review builds on an extensive scientific literature and IPCC recent calculations of the historical and potential impacts of glaciers receding with climate change affecting ecosystem thresholds. It identifies the rate of changes in plant communities and phenologies and processes observed in Tibet Plateau, Greater Himalayas and associated mountain ranges. The increased glacier melting water accounted for the increase in lake's volume. Similarly the water storage properties of glaciers and seasonal snow have been studied focusing on the impact of recent trends regarding glaciers and snow due to climate change. The findings conclude that by the end of twenty-first century, an ecosystem collapse could result from the sensitivity of glaciers towards the current warming scenario and climate change. This reviewed research will draw attention of the international research community towards this region leading to a more dynamic research to deal with the aforementioned crossing of ecological thresholds and anthropogenic problems.

The uniqueness of this odor episode lay in two aspects: (1) the odorous chemicals were quite different from common odorants, such as geosmin and 2-MIB; and (2) it occurred repeatedly in different seasons during a time span of more than 2 years. The screening of odorants was the first and one of the most important steps to address this problem. The field study eliminated the possibility of external pollution and targeted on odorous algal excretion. Odorous water samples were taken at different locations. Headspace solid phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to identify possible odorants. Algal species were observed under a microscope. The GC/MS results indicated that pyrazines and aldehydes, rather than geosmin and 2-MIB, were the most possible peace breakers. Other odorants, such as ketones and thiols, were also detected at trace level. The planktonic algae were detected in high populations in the reservoir. Diatom was regarded as the most possible source of the odor. Guidelines for odorants removal in water treatment process were made to help the local water company address future odor problem.

One hundred and seven species are reported, 25 of which are new records to Cambodia and 8 taxa were unidentifiable to species level. Species richness at the regional and local scale was not significantly different between habitat types or between seasons, whether it was estimated using incidence or abundance data. Comparison of incidence data also revealed no significant difference from species richness of ponds concurrently sampled in the same region. There appeared to be a high level of diversity among sites that could not be attributed to nestedness or to the 5 environmental variables measured. Each habitat type and season offered substantially different rotifer communities, with the proportion of unshared species between sample sets ranging from 14-49%. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and PERMANOVA analyses also revealed clustering and significant differences among sample sets based on habitat type and season. Therefore, each habitat type and season contributed to the overall rotifer biodiversity. When the incidence data from this study are combined with those in previously reported studies, the overall species richness estimate for Cambodia is 403 species (95% CI=386-432) and the number of species records has reached 306.

J	Sullivan, TJ; Stepien, CA				Sullivan, Timothy J.; Stepien, Carol A.			Temporal Population Genetic Structure of Yellow Perch Spawning Groups in the Lower Great Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												This study tested the hypothesis that the genetic composition of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens spawning groups at specific sites remained consistent among years or age-cohorts; this likely would influence spatial population structure and be important for delineating management units. Previous studies identified that spawning groups genetically differed among locations across fine geographic scales, but it was unknown whether these patterns persisted from year to year. We analyzed 15 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci from Yellow Perch spawning at six Lake Erie locations in 2009 in reference to two out-groups spawning in Lakes St. Clair and Ontario. Results were compared with a prior study of samples from the same locations that had been collected in various years, ranging from 2001 to 2005. We evaluated consistency for two of the spawning groups across multiple birth-year-cohorts. Results indicated that the levels of genetic diversity were similar across all spawning groups and years. All eight spawning groups genetically differed from one other, with their allelic compositions varying between the two sampling periods. Some variation occurred among individual sampling years and birth-cohorts, with the 2003 cohort being the most distinctive. Sampling groups contained relatively high proportions of full siblings (mean = 18.5%, ranging to 75% for the 2001 birth-cohort spawning at the eastern Lake Erie site), yet inbreeding appeared relatively low. Differences at sampling sites over time did not appear to reflect genetic drift but may instead suggest that spawning groups reproduce in slightly different locations from year to year or perhaps within a given season; this merits examination. Spatial and temporal patterns may reflect kin-group structuring and differential reproductive success, in which strong year-classes dominate spawning groups and impact genetic structure.

In total, 45 studies were included in the review and these provided data from 41 water bodies, comprising 12 man-made reservoirs, 21 natural lakes, and 8 water courses. Forty-one different taxa (including molluscan Glochidium sp.) in total were recorded. Of these taxa, 2 had not been previously reviewed for Turkey, and 4 were excluded from the list because of dubious identification. The Turkish parasite fauna of common carp living under natural conditions was dominated by ciliates (Ciliophora) among the protozoans and by flatworms (Platyhelminthes) among the metazoans, and this was both in terms of occurrence on fish and across water bodies. The absence of 7 taxa from both the European and North American checklists can be explained by the location of Turkey at the frontier between Asia and Europe. Additionally, the parasite fauna of the common carp in Turkey was consistently different from that of the far eastern species' specimens. Lack of differences among water bodies in both taxon richness and composition indicates overall homogeneity, likely a result of the species' relatively long-term establishment across the region. It is suggested that management options could benefit from this level of homogeneity.					; Ekmekçi, Fitnat/Q-4029-2016; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/C-6263-2012; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/IXD-6486-2023	Tarkan, Ali Serhan/0000-0001-8628-0514; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8103-885X; 													1300-0179	1303-6114					2015	39	4					545	554		10.3906/zoo-1401-42	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-1401-42													WOS:000357587200001

Pseudoraphis spinescens (Poaceae) grasslands at Barmah Forest, Victoria, Australia: current distribution and implications for floodplain conservation	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Floodplain grasslands are highly productive ecosystems that are becoming increasingly degraded and fragmented because of changes to natural flood regimes. In this work, we mapped and quantified the distribution of Pseudoraphis spinescens - an ecologically important mat-forming grass - in treeless floodplain grasslands in the Barmah Forest, Victoria, Australia, across two seasons. Although P. spinescens was once widespread in the forest, there has been a decline in its extent, particularly since the Millennium Drought (2001-09) and subsequent unseasonal and prolonged La Nina-associated flooding from late 2010 to 2012. Our detailed on-ground surveys show that only 182 ha of P. spinescens grassland remain in treeless areas of Barmah Forest, representing similar to 12% of the total area of treeless plains and lakes. Critically, just 51 ha of the thick monospecific P. spinescens swards that were a historically important part of the floodplain vegetation was located and mapped. Although there was a small increase in the area of P. spinescens in some treeless areas following a favourable flood season in 2013-14, the boundaries of most grassland patches remained relatively stable during this period. Potential drivers of the overall decline in P. spinescens across Barmah Forest include the direct and indirect impacts of altered flood regimes, drought, and grazing pressure. Improved understanding of these drivers and their interactions, as well as the status of the seedbank, will be crucial for future management and conservation of these floodplain grasslands.

Trevis. & Boldrini (Cyperaceae)	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA												Aquatic macrophytes are important components of freshwater ecosystems, of which Cyperaceae is the most diverse family. Many species of Cyperaceae form dense populations along lake margins of the southern coast of Brazil, but little is known about their sexual reproductive strategies. We characterized the reproductive life cycle of Eleocharis laeviglumis, an abundant emergent macrophyte of coastal wetlands in southern Brazil, by assessing its reproductive phenophases and estimating the number of its flowers and potentially viable fruits per inflorescence in a natural population. We also tested seed germinability and vigor for a period of four months during a single reproductive season. The species possesses dichogamous and protogynous spikelets with an average duration of 34 days (prea thesis, 1.7 d; anthesis, 6.9 d; fruit maturation, 22.3 d; fruit dispersion, 3.2 d). More than half of the flowers (62.2 %) developed into fruits, while only 5.5 % of the seeds germinated. Germinability and vigor decreased during the reproductive season. Some culms probably originate from asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction of clones. For restoration purposes, we suggest that E. laeviglum is should be propagated by sowing seeds collected at the beginning of the reproductive season, along with the transplantation of rhizomes.

Organohalogen contaminants in common loons (Gavia immer) breeding in Western Alberta, Canada	CHEMOSPHERE												We examined the influence of biological and geographical factors on the levels and patterns of organohalogen contaminants in blood of adult common loons (Gavia immer) collected from 20 lakes in Alberta, Canada. The loons were captured in the 2006 and 2007 breeding seasons over a 900 m elevation gradient across the eastern slope of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. While PCBs dominated the composition of these contaminants in loons at all sites (Sigma PCBs > p,p'-DDE> Sigma PBDEs > Sigma Chlordanes > HCB), p,p'-DDE and Sigma PBDEs were also important, averaging approximately 50% and 20% of total PCB concentrations, respectively. Sigma PCBs and Sigma PBDEs were higher in males than in females. Inter-lake variation was apparent for contaminant concentrations and patterns and were largely explained by dietary signatures (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and proximity to a large hydroelectric dam. Mean Sigma PCB (19.6 ng/g wet weight (ww)) and organochlorine pesticide (OCP) (p,p'-DDE: 11.8 ng/g, cis-nonachlor: 0.10 ng/g, trans-nonachlor: 0.32 ng/g, HCB: 0.34 ng/g ww) concentrations in loons were approximately 4- to 17-fold lower than average concentrations reported in common loons from Atlantic Canada and were well below concentrations which have been associated with impaired reproductive success and eggshell thinning in other piscivorous birds. Dominant PBDE congeners were BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100. The regional mean for Sigma PBDEs (4.04 ng/g ww) in loons from the present study was within the range reported for Sigma PBDEs in nestling bald eagle plasma from British Columbia. This is the first report of PBDEs in loons and the first report of PCBs and OCPs in common loons from Western North America. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	McCary, MA; Jackson, RD; Gratton, C				McCary, Matthew A.; Jackson, Randall D.; Gratton, Claudio			Vegetation structure modulates ecosystem and community responses to spatial subsidies	ECOSPHERE												Ecosystem responses to external inputs of nutrients and organisms are highly variable. Theory predicts that ecosystem traits will determine the responses to spatial subsidies, but evidence for how vegetation structure can modulate those effects is lacking. We investigated how vegetation structure (i.e., leaf area index [LAI] and vegetation height) influenced the ecosystem and community responses to insect spatial subsidies in a subarctic grassland. Our experiment consisted of a 2 x 2 manipulation where in one treatment we either blocked flying insects over a 2-yr period in 1-m(2) plots near the shore of Lake Myvatn, Iceland, where deposition of aquatic adult midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) to land is high, or left control plots accessible to flying midges. In the second treatment, grassland vegetation was cut (tall vs. short) at the start of each season and then allowed to regrow. We then measured litter decomposition and arthropod composition and density within each plot (n = 6 replicates x 4 treatments). Midge-exclusion cages reduced midge deposition by 81% relative to the open plots. Vegetation cutting initially reduced LAI and vegetation height by 3x and 1.5x, respectively, but these were not different by the end of the second-growing season. We found that vegetation structure modulated the effects of midge subsides on litter decomposition, with taller canopies intercepting more insect subsidies than shorter ones, leading to 18% faster litter decomposition. In contrast, the short-vegetation plots intercepted fewer subsidies and had higher temperatures and sunlight, resulting in no effects of midges on decomposition. However, by the end of the experiment when all vegetation structure characteristics had converged across all plots, we found no differences in decomposition between treatments. The effects of midge subsidies on arthropod composition depended on the vegetation structure, suggesting that arthropods might also be responding to the structural effects on spatial subsidies. Our findings indicate that vegetation structure can modify the abiotic environment and the quantity of subsidies entering a recipient ecosystem as aerial insects, resulting in ecosystem- and community-level responses. Thus, changing vegetation structure via habitat disturbances will likely have important implications for ecosystem functions that rely on spatial subsidies.

Seasonal Space Use and Movement of a Grey Wolf (Canis lupus) in a Protected Archipelago in Lake Superior, Ontario	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Data on movement of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in island systems is largely restricted to coastal environments and little is known about their space use and movement in freshwater archipelagos. We used data from a GPS-collared wolf in a protected archipelago in Lake Superior, Ontario to examine broad seasonal patterns in space use, movement, and activity. Over approximately 1 y of monitoring, the wolf made 190 crossings between islands and showed more extensive use of the archipelago during the nonwinter season. When ice was present in the archipelago, the mean weekly inter-island crossing rate of the wolf (6 SE) was 6.08 +/- 1.31, with crossings largely restricted to the interior islands bounded by ice, compared to 2.85 +/- 0.45 during the open water season. Mean wolf activity was highest in the nonwinter season, but movement rates were comparable across seasons. Our study is the first to document wolf movements in a freshwater archipelago with seasonal ice cover and supports data collection at fine temporal scales to better understand trends in wolf space use and movement at small spatial scales.

The study area was divided into four areas (A1, A2, A3, and A4) based on the local hydrological conditions, geographical locations, and nutrient load characteristics. The findings showed that the highest concentration of nutrients appeared in A1, followed by A2 due to anthropogenic activities and the sewage discharge along Ganjiang River. Except for the total amounts of nutrients (the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK)), the nutrient concentrations dropped in the wet season and recovered in the water-recession season. A close association between microorganisms and the soil nutrients was observed. The Integrated Fertility Index (IFI) indicated a significant spatio-temporal variability in the soil fertility. The soil quality was higher in the dry season. The values of the IFI displayed a decreasing trend during the growing season (wet season). The single factor standard index method (SFSI) suggested that the whole area had a potential risk of eutrophication, to which the TN could be considered a main contributor.

This outcrop presents an example of the depositional signature of an end member of temperate valley glaciation, where voluminous sediment supply in a tectonically active setting combines with high annual temperatures and low seasonality to generate significant year-round glacifluvial activity. Such glacial systems produce geologicalclimatic units that are dominated by thick sequences of aggradational gravels and proglacial lake sediments trapped behind outwash heads during deglaciation. At Bayfields Cliff, outwash sequences record an oscillating glacier margin marked by a sequence of glacier-fed, Gilbert-type deltas. The deltas are cut by numerous small-scale, syndepositional, normal faults indicating both loss of glacier support and melt-out of buried ice. A larger-scale thrust fault system reflects late-stage ice overrun. Braid plain gravels and chaotic disturbed glacial lake sediments are also recorded. A notable feature of these systems is the virtual absence of till in an environment with much other evidence for proximal ice. Cumulatively we regard these sedimentlandform associations as diagnostic of debris-laden, perhumid, temperate valley glacier systems.

Infected females were inhibited from producing clutches of eggs and infected males showed much-reduced testicular condition. These deleterious effects on reproduction appear to involve nutrient theft. In addition, there appears to be a greater physical effect of the parasites crushing the gonads of host fish. The results of this study support the theoretical prediction that S. pungitii is a parasitic castrator, as the fitness of the majority of infected female ninespine stickleback was apparently reduced to zero, and there may be a similar effect among the majority of male ninespine stickleback. The symptoms of infection may represent adaptive parasite manipulations resulting in larger, more fecund parasites or an extended parasite-transmission period, although the possibility that the symptoms represent nonadaptive side effects cannot be excluded.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	2004	82	11					1731	1737		10.1139/Z04-171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z04-171													WOS:000227497100007

Populations of aquatic plants, invertebrates, and fish characteristic of these aquatic ecosystems were identified and generic food webs were constructed. Bioenergetics parameters that determine the growth dynamics of these populations were derived from published values for these same or similar species. Input values of light, water temperature,, concentrations of dissolved nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) were constructed from available regional data or data from similar Canadian systems at similar latitudes. The model provides the capability to estimate the probability of changes in the biomass of multiple populations of primary producers and consumers as a function of the concentration of dissolved chemical contaminant. The CASM permits the evaluation of direct toxic effects, as well as: indirect toxic effects that result from changes in competitive or predator-prey relations in complex aquatic food webs. Hypothetical risk assessments were constructed for pentachlorophenol, copper, mercury, and diquat dibromide:in generalized rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in Quebec. Numerical sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were used to describe the relative contributions of direct and indirect toxic effects on overall ecological risks estimated for functional guilds of producers and consumers in these ecosystems, This aquatic ecosystem model may become one component in a decision support system for assessing ecological risks.

Salinity observations in a subtropical estuarine system on the Gold Coast, Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Saltwater Creek and Coombabah Creek are branches of the Coomera River estuary situated within the subtropical Gold Coast City region, Australia, where fresh water flushing occurs during the wet season. The two creek systems are physically adjacent to each other and join at a confluence before connecting to the lower Coomera River. Saltwater Creek is 17 km long and is joined again halfway up its tidal section, via an anabranch, to Coomera River. Coombabah Creek leads upstream to Coombabah Lake, a large shallow lake ringed by mangrove swamps. In order to develop an understanding of how these systems interact with each other, in particular their salinity dynamics, at time scales ranging from tidal to annual, three field studies were undertaken. Field measurements confirmed that the salinity dynamics of these systems were dominated by rainfall and tidal events, typical of estuaries during the 'wet season' in subtropical environments. In contrast, the studies found that hypersaline conditions (salinity as high as 42 psu) developed upstream during the 'dry season' within Coombabah Lake due to the evaporative effects of its large shallow area and adjoining mangrove swamps. Further, the data also revealed that during the dry season, Saltwater Creek's high frequency salinity fluctuations were in-phase with tidal oscillations while Coombabah Creeks' were out-of-phase despite their close proximity. The mechanism for this was attributed to ebb tidal currents in Coombabah Creek which flushed hypersaline water out of the lake past the confluence, and the following flood tidal currents bringing that water into Saltwater Creek. The studies also identified a low frequency oscillation in Coombabah Creeks' salinity which was caused by the diurnal inequality in the tides.

Nematode abundance and species diversity were examined during one vegetation season (July - September 2004). The measured environmental parameters within macrophyte stands were in the same range at all stations, but changed from the beginning to the end of the season. A significantly lower nematode abundance was recorded for stations I and 11 compared to station III. A low number of nematode species (maximum Of twelve per station) was recorded, with no differences in diversity between stations. The variation in abiotic and biotic parameters allowed LIS to subdivide the period of investigation as the beginning of nematode colonization (July samples), stabilization (August samples) and stagnation (September samples). Statistically significant differences in chlorophyll A, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth and fresh macrophyte biomass Occurred between all three months. Non-metric MDS based on square root transformed nematode abundance data separate the July and August nematode assemblages from the September assemblage. Nematode abundance increased from the beginning to the end of the vegetation season, coupled with a decrease in species number. Epistrate feeders as primary consumers dominated in nematode assemblages in all samples, increasing from July to September, followed by 'chewers' (predators and omnivores) as tertiary consumers. Environmental parameters affect the life span of Myriophyllum spicatum L., and could have both direct and indirect effects oil nematode abundance and species diversity.																			0869-6918						2007	15	2					79	88																WOS:000252110800002

We sampled two plantations in each of three areas, and within each plantation sampled two sites with different levels of soil Hg. Woody tissue Hg concentration differed by area, and differences in foliar concentrations, though not statistically significant, were ranked in the same order. Total mass of Hg in forest floor and mineral soil also differed by area, but with ranking opposite that of tissue. On an individual-tree basis, concentrations of Hg in 1994 needles (2-year old) were about twice those in 1995 needles (1-year old) (r = 0.77). Neither woody tissue Hg nor any measure of Hg in soil or forest floor were closely related to foliar levels and some relationships were inverse. We interpret the data to indicate that Hg in plant tissue is derived directly from the atmosphere, not the soil. Tissue concentration by area was closely related to the respective growing season length (1994 needles, r = 0.88; 1995 needles, r = 0.97; wood, r = 0.97), as was total mass of Hg in forest floor and surface mineral soil (r = - 0.80). Other climatic measures, such as growing degree days and actual evapotranspiration, had similar relationships. These relationships imply that both foliar uptake of Hg-0 from the atmosphere and efflux of Hg from the soil system depend on biological activity.																			0049-6979					OCT	1999	115	1-4					513	523		10.1023/A:1005194608598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005194608598													WOS:000083023300027

A hybrid Bayesian-SVD based method to detect false alarms in PERSIANN precipitation estimation product using related physical parameters	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Incorrect estimation of rainfall occurrence, so called False Alarm (FA) is one of the major sources of bias error of satellite based precipitation estimation products and may even cause lots of problems during the bias reduction and calibration processes. In this paper, a hybrid statistical method is introduced to detect FA events of PERSIANN dataset over Urmia Lake basin in northwest of Iran. The main FA detection model is based on Bayesian theorem at which four predictor parameters including PERSIANN rainfall estimations, brightness temperature (Tb), precipitable water (PW) and near surface air temperature (Tair) is considered as its input dataset. In order to decrease the dimensions of input dataset by summarizing their most important modes of variability and correlations to the reference dataset, a technique named singular value decomposition (SVD) is used. The application of Bayesian-SVD method in FA detection of Urmia Lake basin resulted in a trade-off between FA detection and Hit events loss. The results show success of proposed method in detecting about 30% of FA events in return for loss of about 12% of Hit events while better capability of this method in cold seasons is observed.

However, we still do have a poor understanding of their role in the redox transformation of contaminants such as mercury, particularly in fluvial settings. Seasonal and spatial variations in dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) distribution and production were studied in the Bay St. Francois, a wetland in the St. Pierre Lake, a fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River, in Quebec, Canada. A high spatial resolution for DGM, with samples taken every 10-cm depth, was used in field measurements. Through a series of parallel field and incubation experiments, we assessed the main factors determining Hg(0) transformations as a function of depth, seasons, and presence/absence of macrophyte beds. Besides light penetration in the water column and water temperature, iron and dissolved organic carbon likely stimulated Hg(II) reduction. Inversely, chloride favored Hg(0) oxidation. Macrophytes and associated epiphytes appeared to be important sites of adsorption/absorption of Hg(II) and likely of DGM. It seems however that the effects of macrophytes were restricted to immediately adjacent waters. Near the bottom, under anoxic conditions, the reduction of Hg(II) was highly promoted. In addition, sediments and decomposing macrophytes seemed to release DGM and/ or reducible Hg to bottom waters. Overall, differences in DGM between surface and bottom waters tended to be more accentuated than observed differences in DGM between macrophyte beds and sites devoid of plant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores how seasonal water level fluctuations and resulting shifts in land use and environmental factors influence antibiotic sources, distribution, and ecological risks in the largest floodplain-lake (Poyang Lake) in China. The lake was divided into three areas based on water level dynamics: high-water level (HWL) area, fluctuating water level (FWL) area, and dish-shaped lake (DSL) area. In the FWL and DSL areas, seasonal water level fluctuations exerted significant regulatory effects on antibiotic distribution in both water and sediments, while was negligible in the HWL area. Additionally, water level had stronger regulatory effects on the antibiotic distributions in water compared to sediments. The spatial heterogeneity of antibiotic in sediment was weaker compared to water. Under the regulation of water level, the concentrations and ecological risks of antibiotic in water were significantly higher in the FWL and HWL areas than that in the DSL area in dry season (p < 0.05). Antibiotic sources also varied spatially in the water, with animal excreta contributing less in the HWL area (mean 81.2 % and 62.1 %, respectively) than in the DSL (mean 94.2 % and 78.2 %, respectively) and FWL areas (mean 90.0 % and 77.1 %, respectively) during the wet and dry seasons, whereas medical wastewater contributed more in the HWL area (mean 18.8 % and 37.9 %, respectively) than other areas. These findings underscore the role of water level in shaping antibiotic in floodplain-lakes, offering critical insights to address this pressing environmental challenge.

The bottom portion, known as monimolimnion, has been studied for the functional stratification of microbial populations. Recent experiments have reported the profiles of bacterial and nutrient spatial distributions, but quantitative understanding is invoked to unravel the underlying mechanism of maintaining the discrete spatial organization. Here a reaction-diffusion model is developed to highlight the spatial pattern coupled with the light-driven metabolism of bacteria, which is resilient to a wide range of dynamical correlation between bacterial and nutrient species at the molecular level. Particularly, exact analytical solutions of the system are presented together with numerical results, in a good agreement with measurements in Ace lake and Rogoznica lake. Furthermore, one quantitative prediction is reported here on the dynamics of the seasonal stratification patterns in Ace lake. The active role played by the bacterial metabolism at microscale clearly shapes the biogeochemistry landscape of lake-wide ecology at macroscale.

Laboratory assays were carried out to evaluate the decomposition rates of Utricularia breviscapa under controlled conditions of dissolved oxygen and temperature. Measured decomposition rates were then used in model simulations of expected decomposition rates using field collected monthly temperature and dissolved oxygen measures. The incubations were comprised of U. breviscapa detritus added to Oleo Lagoon water under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 15.3 degrees C, 20.8 degrees C, 25.7 degrees C and 30.3 degrees C in the dark. Mass loss and leachate formation were monitored over 180 days. Overall, the decomposition process was faster under aerobic than anaerobic conditions and by increasing at higher temperature. Considering the seasonal changes of temperature and oxygen availability of Oleo Lagoon, the simulated values of mineralization rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and refractory particulate organic carbon (POCR) suggest faster carbon cycling in November. Based on these simulations, in the cold months (June and July) the DOC and COPR mineralization processes were 22% and 25% lower than in the warmer months (October and November), respectively. On average, the DOC mineralization process was 3.7 times faster than POCR.

The vegetation, emerging in temporary waters and colonizing the amphibic shorelines of lakes with fluctuating water levels, was relatively poorly known for a long time, although these habitats offer an important resource for man and his livestock. Based upon the available phytosociological data from Senegal to Burkina Faso, a synopsis of the ephemeral wetland vegetation is presented. The associations and syntaxa of higher rank are published according to the ICPN. A schematic profile illustrates the spatial zonation (hydroseries) of these communities in the North Sudanian and Sahelian zones. To the north, water level fluctuations become stronger and the dry period is more extended. The dominant life forms are free-floating or rooting submerged pleustophytes, hydrogeophytes and short-living amphibic and terrestrial plants. Superimposition of several communities, dominated by different life-forms, is a common phenomenon. The hierarchical classification of 392 releves resulted in 26 associations and 9 rankless communities, grouped into five different classes (Rhamphicarpo fistulosae-Hygrophiletea senegalensis, Ceratophylletea, Lemnetea minoris, Drosero-Xyridetea Ludwigio octovalvis-Echinochloetea colonum) and in two orders of unclear class-position (Nymphaetalia loti, Papyretalia). Water depth, duration of flooding, and the trophic level are the most important differentiating ecological factors. Floating leaf communities (Nymphaeion micranthae, Nymphaeion guineensis), submerged macrophytic vegetation (Ceratophyllion demersi) and free-floating communities (Lemnetea) are concentrated in deeper ponds. The new class Rhamphicarpo-Hygrophiletea senegalensis combines the vegetation of shallow and temporary ponds and of amphibic environments with short-term inundation. The mesotrophic communities of the Echinochloion callopi occur in rapidly draining depressions over lateritic crusts. Nutrient-rich shorelines with muddy substrate in the North Sudanian and Sahelian zones are colonized by the Sagittario guayanensis-Nymphaeion maculatae. The creeping swards of the Brachiario-Cynodontion develop on eutrophic, shortly inundated wet places around Sahelian seasonal lakes, submitted to heavy grazing. The sub-alliances of the Eragrostion squamatae reflect the extent to which the saline groundwater affects the ephemeral vegetation in interdune depressions. The Eriocaulo pumili-Ophioglossion gomezianum (Drosero-Xyridetea) is characterized by members of the families Eriocaulaccae, Xyridaceae, Droseraceae, Lentibulariaceae and Ophioglossaceae. These families are adapted to oligotrophic conditions in seasonally flooded rock pools. Many species which have their primary habitats in ephemeral ponds settle rice fields as their secondary habitats. Rice weed communities in West Africa belong to the order Melochietalia corchorifoliae. From the humid Guinean to the semi-arid Sahelian zone, two trends can be observed: an impoverishment in floristic diversity of the communities, and a reduction of the ecological amplitude towards the borders of the areal. Finally, the vegetation of seasonal and semipermanent lakes of West Africa is compared with other regions. There is a clear floristic contrast to Mediterranean seasonal ponds. Similarities in life strategies, habitat conditions and floristics (on the family and genus-level) exist with other tropical regions of the world. Plant communities with closely related taxa grow in the Neotropis. Vicarious taxa occur for example in the families Scrophulariaceae (Gratiolioideae), Acanthaceae (Hygrophila), Apiaceae (Hydrocotyle), Elatinaceae (Bergia, Elatine), Lythraceae (Ammannia), Menyanthaceae (Nymphoides) and Alismataceae (Limnophyton, Sagittaria).																			0340-269X	2363-7153				AUG 26	2005	35	2-3					327	388		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0327													WOS:000231718000009

Thus, examining the chemical composition of lake DOM and its variations is vital for the protection of lake water environments. Research on the temporal and spatial variability of DOM in specific large lakes remains limited. This study focuses on Dongting Lake, located in the central Yangtze River area, as a representative case, with an emphasis on investigating the spatiotemporal variability of DOM and its controlling factors. The main methods employed include 3D excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEMs) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The results showed that endogenous DOM, characterized by an increase in saturated compounds and aliphatics, was more abundant during the dry season. While in the wet season, terrestrial DOM was relatively more abundant, exhibiting higher aromaticity, humification, and recalcitrance. This shift was mainly attributed to hydrologic-induced expansion in the lake area, which facilitated the input of terrestrial DOM into the lake. Anthropogenic activities, including agricultural off and urban wastewater discharge, also influenced DOM composition, evidenced by higher proportions of CHON and polyphenolic compounds, and O3S + O5S compounds in the lake areas surrounded by corresponding land use types. DOM underwent photo-degradation into small molecular compounds during transport, accumulating in Eastern Dongting Lake area under the impounding effect of the Yangtze River, and underwent transformation due to microbial activity at the sediment-water interface. This study improves our understanding of DOM dynamics in large lakes and provides a scientific basis for the sustainable development and management of water resources and wetland ecological protection in Dongting Lake.

J	Vajda, A; Venäläinen, A				Vajda, A; Venäläinen, A			The influence of natural conditions on the spatial variation of climate in Lapland, Northern Finland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												At high latitudes in Lapland, near the climatological timberline, forestry and other environmental research require detailed information about the spatial variation of climate. In this study, the influence of local geographical factors on the climate in northern Finland (Lapland), as well as the applicability of the kriging interpolation method in the case of detailed spatial resolution, were examined. The spatial analysis of mean, maximum, minimum temperatures, length of the frost-free season, degree-days and daily range was made using a 1 km x 1 km resolution. The time period used was 1971-2000. We studied whether taking account of external forcing, such as lake coverage and altitude, would improve the accuracy of spatial interpolation of climatological parameters. The geographical factors of coordinates, elevation, lakes and sea influence on the regional features of the climate were examined. According to the results of this study, only geographical position and local relief have a significant influence on regional climate in Lapland. The effect of lakes and sea seems to be secondary.

Between January 2001 and December 2002, bimonthly visits were made to the lake to collect data on snail population density and schistosome infection in snails, vegetation and lake water level. Water samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons and chemical analyses were made for major cations, anions, electrical conductivity, total hardness and pH using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater. The seasonal fluctuation in the population density of B. sudanica was found to be highly associated with rainfall, water level of the lake and vegetation availability and abundance. Water chemical analysis showed that major cations and anions were all within the range reported for other African freshwaters. Both malacological and meteorological data show that snail population density in Lake Ziway peaks at the end of the long rainy season (June-August), coinciding with a seasonal transmission peak of schistosomiasis.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				SEP	2006	44	3					347	352		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00615.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00615.x													WOS:000240034500005

Nesting, courtship and kidney hypertrophy in Schistocephalus-infected male three-spined stickleback from an upland lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The effect of Schistocephalus solidus infection on reproductive development and behaviour of male three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus from an upland lake (Llyn Frongoch, Wales, U.K.) was investigated. Uninfected and infected males were collected on two separate occasions during the 2005 breeding season and encouraged to build nests under favourable laboratory conditions. Male nuptial colouration, courtship levels and nesting activity were recorded daily over two separate 21 day studies. Completed nests were removed, encouraging males to build multiple nests. On termination of each study, males were dissected and the kidney and any S. solidus plerocercoids were removed and weighed. In contrast to uninfected males, which readily built multiple nests, no infected males completed a nest during either study. Infected males also exhibited significantly reduced courtship levels, nesting activity, nuptial colouration, kidney development and body condition, compared with uninfected fish. Among infected three-spined stickleback, courtship and nesting behaviours tended to be more severely impacted in fish harbouring heavier plerocercoid burdens. In contrast to other populations, male three-spined stickleback from Llyn Frongoch appear to be unable to overcome the negative impacts of infections on reproductive development and behaviour when provided with short-term favourable conditions. Discrepancies between populations might have been related to the trophic status at the site of capture, emphasizing the importance of studying the biological effects of infections under different environmental conditions.

However, our understanding of Antarctic surface meltwater is limited, with previous studies restricted in spatial or temporal scope. Here, using cloud computing, we produce an Antarctic-wide, monthly dataset of surface meltwater for 2006 to 2021. Surface meltwater covered 3,732 km2 across Antarctica on average during each melt season, with 30% on grounded ice. High interannual variability in meltwater area across the Antarctic Peninsula and in East Antarctica correlates with large-scale modes of climate variability. In west Antarctica, meltwater area is comparatively low and this correlation is absent. An increase in the magnitude and variability of surface meltwater area without a coincident increase in modelled snowmelt in East Antarctica indicates that the ice-sheet surface might be becoming more favourable to meltwater ponding.					; Lea, James/HNI-3615-2023	Livingstone, Stephen/0000-0002-7240-5037; Gilbert, Ella/0000-0001-5272-8894; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				JUL	2025	15	7								10.1038/s41558-025-02363-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02363-5													WOS:001524890500016

Linking climate change and progressive eutrophication to incidents of clustered animal mortalities in different geographical regions of South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms have become an increasing problem in South African freshwater bodies. Since certain species of cyanobacteria are well-known for biosynthesis of potent hepatic and neurotoxins, such blooms can pose a significant threat to the health of animals and humans. The massive proliferation of these organisms in rivers and lakes is largely due to progressive eutrophication. However, a warming trend in the Southern hemisphere, indicated by a threefold increase in the minimum temperature compared to maximum temperature between 1950 and 1990, is likely the cause of the increasing occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial bloom forming species, previously hampered by low water temperatures in different geographical regions of South Africa.					; Botha-Oberholster, Anna-Maria/B-1215-2008	Botha, Anna-Maria/0000-0002-9868-1566; 													1684-5315					NOV 2	2009	8	21					5825	5832																WOS:000273718700028
J	Casselman, SJ; Montgomerie, R				Casselman, SJ; Montgomerie, R			Sperm traits in relation to male quality in colonial spawning bluegill	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Sperm traits (morphology, motility and concentration within ejaculates) and various correlates of male quality (age, body condition, spawning location and timing) were studied in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, breeding in both the interior and periphery of six colonies in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada. Sperm traits varied significantly more among than within males suggesting that some aspect of male phenotype might influence sperm morphology and behaviour. No measures of male body condition or size were correlated with any sperm or ejaculate traits, when controlling statistically for confounding variables. Sperm swimming speed increased significantly with male age and varied significantly among spawning bouts (controlling for sperm tail length) suggesting that some unknown aspects of male quality might influence the fertilization capacity of spermatozoa. Sperm concentration in ejaculates was significantly higher in males nesting in the interior rather than the periphery of a colony suggesting that those males might also have higher fertilization capacity correlated with their superior dominance status or the lower risk of sperm competition. Thus, older males nesting in the interior of a colony during the first spawning bout of the season are expected to be the best sperm competitors in this population, but the physiological reasons for this increased fertilization capacity remain unknown.

However, previous research has not yet applied the FUI to the entire basin. This study generates 730 lakes FUI data for the Yangtze River Basin from 1984 to 2023, divided into ten periods of four years each, using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Pixel-scale calculations and classifications were employed to objectively determine the spatial-temporal evolution patterns of lakes FUI. Various primary indicators, including hydrology, climate, economy, and human activity, were analyzed to explore the driving mechanisms of FUI variations. Lakes in the Yangtze River Basin are categorized into two groups: those located in the source region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the remaining non-source region lakes. The findings revealed that (1) over 80 % of lake water in the source region was blue (FUI < 10), with 83.06 % of lakes showing a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2023; (2) lakes in non-source areas exhibited seasonal variations. Among these, 80 % of lakes were green or yellow (FUI > 10), and 67.51 % showed a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2023; (3) the increase in rainfall and air temperature was identified as the primary cause of the bluing of all lakes in the source region, also leading to increased erosion intensity and the formation of small thermokarst lakes (<5 km(2)) that appeared yellow (FUI > 10); and (4) The enhanced protection of the Yangtze River after 2008 has reduced pollution emissions, leading to the increase of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), and significantly promoted the reduction of lakes FUI in the non-source region. Besides, the massive reduction of human activities during the COVID-19 epidemic directly led to the alleviation of the lake's trophic status index (TSI) and the reduction of the urban lake's FUI. This study suggests that more efficient lake management and protection strategies are needed to address the challenges facing the Yangtze River Basin due to climate change and human activities.

Alphaproteobacteria dominated the community, with relative abundances (42 +/- 12% [mean +/- SD, n = 40] of total prokaryote abundance) much higher than those in other freshwater communities described in the literature. The second most abundant groups were Actinobacteria (14 +/- 9.6%) and Betaproteobacteria (12 +/- 6%) followed by the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF) cluster (5.8 +/- 3.5%). Filament communities were less diverse, consisting of only Alphaproteobacteria (64 +/- 15% [n = 44] of the total filament abundance) and the CF cluster (28 +/- 16%). Although seasonal patterns were different among different phylogenetic and morphotypic groups, Alphaproteobacteria consistently dominated the community throughout the seasons. Our data suggest that Lake Biwa differs from other lakes in some key aspects, urging further investigation of detailed taxonomic compositions and ecological features of freshwater Alphaproteobacteria.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				AUG 9	2007	48	3					231	240		10.3354/ame048231	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame048231													WOS:000249177300003

Given the high chemical pollution of Chapala Lake (including POPs), consumption of this water poses a genotoxic risk for people in the Guadalajara metropolitan area. Concentrations of POPs were quantified in water from Chapala Lake, Sayula Lake and in the liver of Goodea atripinnis on two seasons of the year: the dry and rainy seasons of 2006. Chromatographic analysis of the water showed very low concentrations of POPs and variations from one season to another. The increase of methoxychlor, 2,4 D and DDT is notable, indicating that they are dragged into the water bodies during the rainy season. POPs were detected in the liver of fish from both lakes; however, 2,4 D in the liver of fish from Chapala (0.02 ppm) is 10 times as concentrated as in Sayula (0.002 ppm). The evaluation of genetic damage by alkaline comet assay in hepatocytes during the dry season showed significant genetic damage (p < 0.01) in fish from the two reservoirs, probably due to 2,4 D. In the rainy season there was a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the case of Sayula but not for Chapala. Genetic damage in Sayula can be attributed to other substances with a mutagenic capacity different to that of POPs.

J	Seguchi, S				Seguchi, Shinji			Landscape 'Neolithization' Among the Hunter-Fisher-Gatherers of Lake Biwa, Central Japan	JOURNAL OF WORLD PREHISTORY												The concept of Neolithization has been used to examine a wide range of human relationships to the post-glacial environment, including the rise of farming and the invention of new adaptive technologies, like pottery. This paper focuses on understanding the establishment of sedentary life-ways by Jomon hunter-fisher-gatherers living around Lake Biwa, Central Japan, as a key aspect of Neolithization processes. Natural landscapes in this area presented different opportunities for human subsistence and settlement. Focusing on the characteristics and distribution of key aquatic and terrestrial resources, it is clear that two settlement strategies could have been sustained by local hunter-fisher-gatherer populations. The first involved targeting settlement in areas with complementary resources to avoid the risk of seasonal shortfalls; these areas are, however, limited geographically and would have filled up quickly. The second strategy involved a more elaborate approach to the logistics of mobility and food storage to secure the resources to sustain a settled life; this strategy opened up much larger areas for colonization. This analysis demonstrates that early populations initially favored the first strategy, but then shifted to the second, as population pressures generated major landscape shifts toward the end of the Middle Jomon period (4000 cal BP).																			0892-7537	1573-7802				DEC	2014	27	3-4			SI		225	245		10.1007/s10963-014-9078-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10963-014-9078-9													WOS:000345421700002
J	Blanchard, M; Teil, MJ; Chevreuil, M				Blanchard, M.; Teil, M. J.; Chevreuil, M.			The seasonal fate of PCBs in ambient air and atmospheric deposition in northern France	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as Sigma 21 congeners, were investigated in atmospheric bulk deposition over one year, along a northern transect of France, including 5 sites from the Atlantic coast to the east of Paris. Evidence was obtained for an easterly rise of the PCB concentrations, from 3 to 76 ng L-1. The PCB patterns were depleted in low chlorinated congeners in rural areas whereas at urban sites, the profiles were typical of local sources. The seasonal variations of concentrations were mainly controlled by the temperature. Next, At Paris, PCB distribution between the gaseous and the particulate phases was studied, considering seasonal parameters and different fate processes. Their distribution showed a prevalence of congeners in the gaseous phase (0.15-1.17 ng m(-3)) which occurrence decreased from 93 to 68% with the rise of congener chlorination level. In the particulate phase, they ranged from 0.01 to 0.27 ng m(-3), only. Rainwater concentrations ranged from 3.1 to 13.1 ng L-1. A total rain water/air washout ratio was determined and showed a negative correlation with those reported in the literature. That might be attributed to the importance of particle scavenging. The annual bulk deposition ranged from 8 to 29 mu g m(-2). A decreasing trend of PCB atmospheric levels over the last fifteen years was confirmed in the studied area.					teil, m/F-2231-2010														0167-7764	1573-0662				FEB	2006	53	2					123	144		10.1007/s10874-006-1321-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10874-006-1321-z													WOS:000240552400003

Canola yield mainly varies with spatial heterogeneity of soil properties, crop parameters, and meteorological conditions; thus, existing yield estimation models must be revised before being adopted in Northwestern Ontario to ensure accuracy. Region-specific canola cultivation guidelines are essential. This study utilized high spatial-resolution images to estimate flower coverage and yield in experimental plots at the Lakehead University Agricultural Research Station, Thunder Bay, Canada. Spectral profiles were created for canola flowers and pods. During the peak flowering period, the reflectance of green and red bands was almost identical, allowing for the successful classification of yellow flower coverage using a recursive partitioning and regression tree algorithm. A notable decrease in reflectance in the RedEdge and NIR bands was observed during the transition from pod maturation to senescence, reflecting physiological changes. Canola yield was estimated using selected vegetation indices derived from images, the percent cover of flowers, and the M5P Model Tree algorithm. Field samples were used to calibrate and validate prediction models. The model's prediction accuracy was high, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.78 and a mean squared error of 7.2 kg/ha compared to field samples. In conclusion, this study provided an important insight into canola growth using remote sensing. In the future, when modelling, it is recommended to consider other variables (soil nutrients and climate) that might affect crop development.																				2072-4292				JUN 21	2025	17	13							2127	10.3390/rs17132127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17132127													WOS:001526285700001

Seasonal Dynamics of Soil CO2 Concentration and CO2 Fluxes from the Soil of the Former Lake Texcoco, Mexico	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Seasonal changes of the soil CO2 concentration and the rate of CO2 fluxes emission from the soil formed on the sediments of the former Lake Texcoco, which occupied a significant part of the Mexico Valley until the mid-17th century, were studied. The soils (Fluvic Endogleyic Phaeozems) were characterized by a low CO2 fluxes rate, which is related to their high alkalinity. The mean values of soil respiration were 6.0-14.1 mg C/(m(2) h) depending on vegetation type, which corresponds to 60-157 g C/(m(2) yr). The contribution of plants to the CO2 fluxes insignificantly varied by seasons and depended on the species composition of vegetation. The soil CO2 concentration and soil respiration in eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) plantation were two times higher than those in the grass-subshrub area, the ground cover of which consisted of Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene and Suaeda nigra (Raf.) J.F. Macbr. species. This can be related to the significant volumes of gas production during the respiration of eucalypt roots and associated rhizosphere community. The contribution of the root systems of grass cover to the soil CO2 fluxes in eucalypt plantation slightly varied within the year and was equal to 24% on the average. In the grass-subshrub area, its value varied from 41% in the cold season to 60% in the warm season. The spatial variability of soil CO2 concentration and its flux rate to the atmosphere was due to the differences in plant species composition and hydrothermal conditions, and their temporal trend was closely related to the seasonal accumulation of plant biomass and soil temperature.

Use of littoral algae to detect zones of nutrient enrichment in the littoral of an oligotrophic lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The potential for using benthic algae to identify areas around the lake littoral that are potentially influenced by diffuse inputs of nutrients is considered through research based around Ennerdale Water in NW England. This is an oligotrophic lake with a highly sensitive population of Margalifera margalifera in the outflow river. Water chemistry, algal biomass, diatoms and macroalgae were studied at six points around the perimeter of the lake. Evidence of higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients along with alterations in the diatom and, to a lesser extent, macroalgae assemblages was found in the north-west corner of the lake. Algal biomass gave a more ambiguous signal, with local variations in biomass masked by stronger seasonal signals that determined the quantity of algae present at a site on any given date. These results demonstrate the potential for using benthic algae to generate more focussed data on the condition of a lake than is possible with the whole-lake assessments on which classifications are based.

Isotopic evidence for broad diet including anadromous fish during the mid-Holocene in northeastern North America	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Archaeological evidence, including riverine and lake settlements, as well as fishing and netting artifacts, suggests that there was an increased reliance on inland fisheries during the mid-Holocene (ca. 4500-1800 cal BP) in northeastern North America. Unfortunately, more direct lines of evidence investigating this idea have not been thoroughly examined due to several factors, including inconsistent excavation techniques, and limitations in destructive analysis of human material remains. Here, we measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values from one human female and fifteen terrestrial and aquatic faunal taxa from deposits within the mid-Holocene site, Dutchess Quarry Cave 1 (Orange County, NY), to assess dietary source proportions and determine whether anadromous fish were a prominent dietary component for this individual. Using cluster analysis, potential prey species were grouped into three sources consistent with anadromous fish ("prey 1"), carnivores and omnivores ("prey 2"), and terrestrial herbivores and game birds ("prey 3"). We evaluated the relative contributions of the stable isotope values of the three prey groups using Bayesian analysis with MixSIAR. Our results indicate that animals within prey 3 made up the largest component of this individual's diet, implying that terrestrial herbivores and game birds likely dominated her diet. Fauna from isotope groups prey 1 (anadromous fish) and 2 (carnivores and omnivores) supplemented the diet. Based on these data, it appears that anadromous fish were a seasonal component of human diet and that the incorporation of these resources did not involve the dramatic reduction of other year-round protein sources.

Negative allometric growth was estimated for gibel carp in both seasons: TW = 0.0396 x TL2.7583 (N= 50, November 2016) and TW = 0.0269 x TL2.8639 (N= 50, May 2017). Condition factor K registered values between 1.44 and 2.38 (cold season), 1.49 and 3.79 (warm season). The physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, chemical oxygen demand, ammonium nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and phosphorus-phosphate were determined, in order to evaluate the impact of abiotic environmental conditions on fish population. The microbiological examination of water quality was also carried out, to detect the micromycetes which may pose health risk to both human and fish. The presence of Penicillium spp. and some yeast strains were confirmed in water samples from the studied area. According to all analyzed parameters, the water resource was found to be within the suitable range for well-being of C. gibelio, which is important assuming that local fishermen often catch and eat gibel carp. To our knowledge, this paper provides first information on length-weight relationship, Fulton's K condition factor and the size structure of Carassius gibelio from Pantelimon II Lake.

J	Landmann, G; Kempe, S				Landmann, G; Kempe, S			Annual deposition signal versus lake dynamics: Microprobe analysis of Lake Van (Turkey) sediments reveals missing varves in the period 11.2-10.2 ka BP	FACIES												Microprobe measurements revealed changes of elemental concentrations along thin-section profiles of laminated Lake Van sediments. Results show pronounced variations, interpreted as seasonal cycles, thus allowing a new varve count based on alternating Ca and Si peaks. Compared with previous optical counts, the new record adds 170 years and places the investigated interval at 11.2-10.2 ka BP. The microprobe data reveal unusual Mg concentrations between 11.2 and 10.7 ka BP. These are caused by diagenetic magnesite and protodolomite, thought to be indicative of a lake-level regression and evaporative conditions causing the Mg content of the lake water to rise to critical levels. The dry phase ended with a transgression that started at around 10.7 ka BP and brought about a meromictic phase which weakened the climate-induced seasonal deposition signal. Both the diagenetic mineral formation and the mixing behavior of the lake decreased the grey scale value differences of the annual deposition signal, which had led to underestimation of years when varves were counted optically. Similar processes may have occurred in the evolution of Lake Lisan which would explain the marked differences between optical laminae counting and radiocarbon dating observed by other authors.

J	Abalasei, ME; Toma, D; Teodosiu, C				Abalasei, Madalina Elena; Toma, Daniel; Teodosiu, Carmen			Monitoring and Evaluation of Water Quality from Chirita Lake, Romania	WATER												Water management is a significant challenge, stimulating synergies between scientists and practitioners to create new tools and approaches to streamline decision making in this field. The assessment and monitoring of freshwater quality in surface water bodies are crucial for sustainable and safe water management. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the characteristics and properties of Chirita lake, assess seasonal variations in water quality, determine compliance with national environmental legislation, and perform a comparison with monitoring systems in other European lakes. The study used data that determined water quality indicators for a five-year period, from 2020 to 2024, considering temperature, turbidity, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, hardness, organic matter, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, and chlorides. The statistical analysis technique based on the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the seasonal correlations of water quality parameters in Chirita lake and to extract the essential parameters for assessing seasonal variations in river water quality. The results obtained indicated that the indicators considered important for water quality variation in one season may not be important in another season, except for organic matter and conductivity, which showed a significant contribution to water quality variation throughout the four seasons. This study demonstrated that lake water is classified as first class, according to national regulations. These results provide valuable support for local authorities to develop effective strategies for water quality management and the prevention of eutrophication processes in reservoirs.

Hara (Hydrocharitaceae) to increasing nutrient loadings	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												To explore the effects of water column nutrient loading on photosynthesis of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara during the growth season (June to October), we determined the diurnal and seasonal variation in rapid light curves of plants cultivated under 4 different nutrient concentrations (N-P [mg L-1]: (1) 0.5, 0.05; (2) 1.0, 0.1; (3) 5.0, 0.5; (4) 10.0, 1.0). Nutrient concentration significantly affected the magnitude of the rapid light curves of V. natans, but not the direction of their diurnal variations. At low nutrient conditions (N-P 1 [mg L-1]: 0.5, 0.05), the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETR(max)) and minimum saturating irradiance (E-k) derived from rapid light curves were significantly lower than those of other treatments, and their seasonal variations were suppressed. These results indicated that photosynthesis of V. natans was inhibited by the lack of nutrients in water column. At high nutrient conditions (N-P 4, [mg L-1]: 10.0, 1.0), there was an increase in photosynthetic rate in the light-limited region of rapid light curve (alpha), and a decrease in rETR(max) and E-k, relative to moderate nutrient conditions (N-P 2, [mg L-1]: 1.0, 0.1). In addition, at high nutrient concentrations, the rapid light curves of V. natans reached a plateau, and then markedly declined compared with those at the lower nutrient levels, especially in July and August. These results suggested that V. natans were adapted to low-light environments in the high-nutrient loading treatment.					; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021	Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; 													0300-3604	1573-9058				SEP	2012	50	3					437	446		10.1007/s11099-012-0046-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-012-0046-2													WOS:000307309000016

Diel and seasonal variations in the population dynamics of Hemimysis anomala, a non-indigenous mysid: implications for surveillance and management	AQUATIC INVASIONS												This study investigated diel and seasonal variations in the population dynamics of Hemimysis anomala, a non-indigenous mysid originating from the Ponto-Caspian region. There were strong diel variations in the abundance (catch-per-unit-effort; CPUE) of H. anomala, with CPUE being low during the day but increasing by up to an order of magnitude at night. Abundance also varied seasonally, with CPUE increasing from mid-May to a peak in late June/early July, followed by a crash in mid-July. However, the seasonal variations in abundance were apparent only in nocturnal surveys, with CPUE during the day being low throughout the study. There were also seasonal variations in population structure (life stages, length distributions, sex ratios, reproductive state, fecundity). The nocturnal behaviour of H. anomala renders it difficult to assess its geographical distribution or population dynamics using only diurnal surveys or inappropriate sampling methods, which could underestimate the size, structure, reproductive potential and sustainability of non-indigenous populations of this invasive species. Surveillance programmes for H. anomala should therefore be conducted at night, at intervals throughout the year and targeting likely habitats using site-specific methods of proven effectiveness.

In this report, we review progress on estimating and understanding both the magnitude of, and controls on, emissions of CH4 from natural wetlands. We also calculate global wetland CH4 emissions using this extensive flux data base and the wetland areas compiled and published by Matthews and Fung (1987). Tropical regions (20-degrees-N-30-degrees-S) were calculated to release 66 TgCH4/yr, 60% of the total wetland emission of 109 Tg/yr. Flux data from tropical wetlands, reported only within the last four years, are currently restricted in geographic coverage. Additional data from other regions will be required to confirm these calculated large emissions. Although emissions from subtropical and temperate wetlands (45-degrees-N-20-degrees-N and 30-degrees-S-50-degrees-S) were relatively low at 5 Tg/yr, the process-oriented focus of most of the research in this region suggests that work at these latitudes may serve as models to examine controls and possible uncertainties in estimating fluxes. These types of efforts are frequently not possible in more remote, globally significant wetlands. Northern wetlands (north of 45-degrees-N) were calculated to release a total of 38 TgCH4/yr (34% of total flux); 34 Tg/yr from wet soils and 4 Tg/yr from relatively dry tundra. These latitudes have been the focus of recent intensive research. Significant differences between the relatively large flux data bases accumulated in the two primary measurement areas, northern Minnesota and the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, indicate that extrapolation from one wetland region to another may be subject to considerable error. Global emissions were also compared to fluxes calculated using the wetland areas published by Aselmann and Crutzen (1989) in an effort to assess uncertainties due to wetland area estimates. Further refinement of wetland CH4 emissions awaits flux measurements from large areas currently lacking data, particularly in the tropics and the Siberian Lowlands, more realistic assessments of seasonal active periods, and accurate, up-to-date habitat classification and measurement.																			0045-6535					JAN-FEB	1993	26	1-4					261	320		10.1016/0045-6535(93)90427-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(93)90427-7													WOS:A1993KM22500021

Juncus Bulbosus Tissue Nutrient Concentrations and Stoichiometry in Oligotrophic Ecosystems: Variability with Seasons, Growth Forms, Organs and Habitats	PLANTS-BASEL												Aquatic plant nutrient concentrations provide important information to characterise their role in nutrient retention and turnover in aquatic ecosystems. While large standing biomass of aquatic plants is typically found in nutrient-rich localities, it may also occur in oligotrophic ecosystems. Juncus bulbosus is able to form massive stands even in very nutrient-dilute waters. Here we show that this may be achieved by tissues with very high carbon-to-nutrient ratios combined with perennial (slow) growth and a poor food source for grazers inferred from plant stoichiometry and tissue nutrient thresholds. We also show that the C, N, P and C:N:P stoichiometric ratios of Juncus bulbosus vary with the time of year, habitats (lakes versus rivers) and organs (roots versus shoots). We found no differences between growth forms (notably in P, inferred as the most limiting nutrient) corresponding to small and large plant stands. The mass development of J. bulbosus requires C, N and P, whatever the ecosystem (lake or river), and not just CO2 and NH4, as suggested in previous studies. Since macrophytes inhabiting oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems are dominated by isoetids (perennial plants with a high root/shoot ratio), attention should be paid to quantifying the role of roots in aquatic plant stoichiometry, nutrient turnover and nutrient retention.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Seasonal termination of the vernal clear-water phase in Long Lake, Grand Traverse Co., Michigan coincided with severe size-selective predation on juvenile Daphnia pulicaria from 0.8 to 1.8 mm in length. This could be caused by predation by age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) or by the exotic predatory zooplankter Bythotrephes cederstroemi. 2. During the initial decline of Daphnia, Ivlev's electivity coefficient for yellow perch from 15.0 to 20.0 mm in length was 0.50 for copepods and -0.75 for D. pulicaria. 3. Bioenergetics modelling of both yellow perch and Bythotrephes demonstrates that, during the initial Daphnia decline, Bythotrephes consumed 1.5-5 times greater total mass than yellow perch. Furthermore, models in which Bythotrephes consumed juvenile Daphnia were more consistent with the timing of the Daphnia decline than those in which yellow perch consumed juvenile Daphnia. 4. The invasion of Bythotrephes into Long Lake seems to be a significant perturbation, introducing effects that propagate throughout the food chain. Bythotrephes created a possible bottleneck for age-0 yellow perch in late June by suppressing Daphnia.																			0046-5070					JUN	2001	46	6					759	775		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00716.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00716.x													WOS:000169472900005

Wetland types and wetland maps differ in ability to predict dissolved organic carbon concentrations in streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					5th International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior	JUN 25-30, 2006	Univ Calf Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA		Univ Calf Santa Cruz			Three categories of digital wetland maps widely available in the United States were used to develop models relating wetlands to DOC: (1) wetlands mapped by the U.S. National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) (2) wetland vegetation cover mapped by the U.S. National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and (3) maps of hydric soils. Data extracted from these maps for 27 headwater catchments of the Ontonagon River in northern Michigan, USA were used with DOC concentrations measured in catchment streams to develop stepwise multiple regressions based on wetland area and type. The catchments of the 27 tributaries ranged in area from 2 to 66 km(2) and wetlands constituted 10 to 53% of their area. Although all three databases provided regressions that were highly significant (p<0.001), the variance explained was greater for NWI maps (R-2=0.75) than for NLCD (R-2=0.61) or soil maps (R-2=0.60). Wetland-stream relationships were strongest during September 2002, but were significant for nine out of ten dates sampled during subsequent seasons. The individual wetland type most highly correlated (r>0.62) with stream DOC concentrations was conifer peatland, represented on the NWI maps as Palustrine Needle-leaved Forest, the NLCD maps as woody wetland, and the soil maps as organic soils. For the NWI dataset, DOC was negatively correlated with area of palustrine emergent wetlands (i.e., sedge meadows and graminoid fens) and bog shrubs, inferring that these wetland types may be sinks for DOC. Because of the different effects of wetland vegetation types on DOC, a GIS data source such as the NWI which depicts those wetland types is superior for predicting landscape contributions to stream DOC concentrations.

Effects of habitat on mallard duckling survival in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat provides food and shelter resources for prefledgling waterfowl and thus plays a critical role in their growth, development, and survival. However, few studies have examined whether and how particular elements of habitat affect duckling survival. We investigated relationships of duckling survival rates with distance of overland travel, wetland vegetation composition, water permanency, and surrounding upland vegetation for 116 mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) broods in the Great Lakes region from 2001 to 2003. We found that the probability, on hatch day, that a mallard duckling will survive to 55 days was positively related to the proportion of wetland area that was vegetated and negatively related to the proportion of forest cover within 500 m of duckling locations. We found little support for relationships between duckling survival rates and the proportions of grasslands or seasonal wetlands or to distances traveled overland by broods. Our results suggest that conservation groups and wildlife managers in the Great Lakes region can improve mallard duckling survival rates by managing for, creating, and protecting vegetated wetlands and focusing efforts within lightly-forested areas.																			0022-541X					AUG	2007	71	6					1885	1891		10.2193/2006-204	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-204													WOS:000248655400018

Patterns of landscape use by female brown bears on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We describe landscape use of female brown bears (Ursus arctos) on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, USA. Radiocollars, fitted to 43 adult female brown bears, provided radio relocations, which we used to describe habitat use patterns by season and reproductive class at the landscape scale. Brown bears were associated with areas with low densities of human developments and roads, as well as riparian areas that were close to cover. Presence of streams and lakes that supported spawning salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) positively influenced summertime distribution of bears. Female brown bears with cubs avoided concentrations of other bears. Resource managers may use this information to respond to brown bear conservation issues associated with increasing human populations and associated development in the establishment of road density standards, seasonal road closures, management of recreation sites, and vegetation management on the Kenai Peninsula.

J	Curtis, JH; Brenner, M; Hodell, DA				Curtis, JH; Brenner, M; Hodell, DA			Climate change in the Lake Valencia Basin, Venezuela, ≈12600 yr BP to present	HOLOCENE												We present a palaeoclimate record for northern South America, extending from the latest Pleistocene (similar to 12600 C-14 yr BP) to present. Climate reconstruction for the Valencia Basin, Venezuela, was based on sediment geochemistry and delta(18)O records from ostracod and gastropod shells in a 568 cm sediment core. Sediment chronology was established by AMS C-14 dating of terrestrial wood fragments. From similar to 12600 to similar to 10000 C-14 yr BP the Valencia basin was drier than present and the coring site, now under 9.4 m of water, was only intermittently wet. After similar to 10000 C-14 yr BP, moisture availability increased and lake level rose, permanently covering the core site. From similar to 10000 to similar to 8200 C-14 yr BP, Lake Valencia was hydrologically closed and the isotope records reflect pronounced variability in the ratio of evaporation to precipitation. During the wetter early to middle Holocene (similar to 8200 to similar to 3000 C-14 yr BP), lake level was high and water was lost to outflow. Greater moisture availability at this time may have been caused by increased intensity of the annual cycle (with wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons), a result of large, orbitally driven differences in seasonal insolation. Two brief periods of lower lake level, at similar to 7000 and similar to 3300 C-14 yr BP, are indicated in the oxygen isotope and calcium carbonate records. Since similar to 3000 C-14 yr BP, water level in Lake Valencia has been dropping.

Preliminary observations of adult white sturgeon have shown what appeared to be a progressive upstream movement during the spawning season, spawning over sand substrate seldom reaching the typical sturgeon spawning habitat of gravel and cobble located upstream of rkm 244.6. This behavior may be unusual for a white sturgeon population. The primary objective of this paper is to compare, within each spawning season and between seasons, the spatial and temporal pattern of egg collections ( as an indicator of spawning location) and the spatial and temporal pattern of suspected spawners, as determined by their movement from 1994 to 1999. Adult white sturgeon were tagged with sonic and radio transmitters. Artificial substrate mats were deployed within three sampling reaches to determine approximate spawning locations and timing in reference to locations of spawners. Eggs were collected 207 different times from 1994 to 1999, including 123 times in the lower reach and 84 times in the middle reach. White sturgeon demonstrated a consistent temporal pattern of shifting spawning location as the season progressed, first spawning in the lower reach and then moving upstream to the middle reach. A total of 1234 contacts of potential spawners were made during May and June for the years 1994 1999. Some spawners were located in as many as four different locations from which eggs were collected within a season. There appeared to be at least five primary spawning locations, most in the vicinity of outside bends. This movement and temporal spawning pattern appears to be unique when compared with published studies on other sturgeon populations. Companion studies indicate that the species is not recruiting despite mitigative measures, and white sturgeon are thought to be spawning in unsuitable habitat. The combination of movement by white sturgeon within this sandy reach during the spawning season and spawning in unsuitable habitat may be contributing to the failure of recruitment. Present measures to recover the population may be inadequate. Further study is needed to determine if this movement pattern is caused by changing water velocities. Also, if historic spawning locations cannot be identified and rehabilitated, then we suggest consideration be given to habitat enhancement measures at the present spawning locations.																			0175-8659					DEC	2002	18	4-6					608	616		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00397.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00397.x													WOS:000179913400059

We studied the response of the natural parasite fauna of Daphnia longispina to nutrient enrichment in mesocosms in a small humic lake. We measured the concentrations of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen in the water, total nutrients in the seston, algal and bacterial biomass, Daphnia population dynamics, Daphnia stoichiometry, Daphnia stable isotope values and the presence and abundance of parasites in treated mesocosms as compared to three control ones. Incorporation of the nutrient enrichment in the food web was seen as increased nutrient concentrations in the epilimnion and as a decrease in carbon:nutrient ratios and delta N-15 values in Daphnia. Nutrient enrichment did not significantly influence algal, bacterial or Daphnia biomass. One of the four parasite species observed, unidentified small gut parasite, had a higher prevalence (percentage of Daphnia infected) in treated mesocosms, but its intensity (number of parasites per infected host) remained the same among treatments. Our results suggest that the effect of nutrient enrichment on host-parasite dynamics is dependent on complex interactions within food webs and on the epidemiological traits of parasites.					; Aalto, Sanni/AAY-5338-2021	Aalto, Sanni L/0000-0002-6724-2632; Pulkkinen, Katja/0000-0002-1480-2464; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2013	715	1					5	18		10.1007/s10750-012-1261-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1261-3													WOS:000322901200002
J	Le, HT; Ngo, HTT				Ha Thu Le; Huong Thi Thuy Ngo			Cd, Pb, and Cu in water and sediments and their bioaccumulation in freshwater fish of some lakes in Hanoi, Vietnam	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The seasonal variations of Cd, Pb, and Cu in the water, sediments, and freshwater fish (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Cirrhinus molitorella, and Oreochromis mossambicus) of four lakes in Hanoi, Vietnam, were investigated. Samples for analysis were taken four times from April 2010 to March 2011. The levels in water were lower than the Vietnamese standards, except for Pb, but they were all much higher than the Canadian standards for protection of aquatic life; in the sediments, they were higher than world average levels. Bioaccumulation of the three metals in fish was site-dependent and species-dependent, but correlations of their levels in fish to those in water and sediments were weak. Levels of Pb in fish exceeded those of the UK and the WHO standards, and the recommended values of Vietnam for human consumption. Overall, the results show that the lakes are polluted with these metals, and consumption of high quantities of fish from them may be problematic. The outcome of this research helps to establish background data for future monitoring.

Mercury (Hg) emissions from some upstream gold mining areas and recent findings of high natural Hg levels in tropical oxisols motivated studies on the Hg cycle in the Pantanal. A survey was made on total Hg in the most consumed piscivorous fish species from rivers and floodplain lakes in the north (Caceres and Barao de Melgaco) and in the south part of Alto Pantanal (around the confluence of the Cuiaba and Paraguai rivers). Samples were collected in both the rainy and dry seasons (March and August 1998) and included piranha (Serrasalmus spp.), and catfish (Pseudoplatystoma coruscans, pintado, and Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum, cachara or surubim). There was only a small spatial variation in Hg concentration of the 185 analyzed fish samples from the 200 x 200 km large investigation area, and 90% contained total Hg concentration below the safety limit for regular fish consumption (500 ng g(-1)). Concentration above this limit was found in both Pseudoplatystoma and Serrasalmus samples from the Baia Sia Mariana, the only acid soft-water lake included in this study, during both the rainy and dry seasons. Concentration above this limit was also found in fish outside Baia Sia Mariana during the dry season, especially in Rio Cuiaba in the region of Barao de Melgaco. The seasonal effect may be connected with decreasing water volumes and changing habitat during the dry season. The results indicate that fertile women should restrict their consumption of piscivorous fishes from the Rio Cuiaba basin during the dry season. Measures should be implanted to avoid a further deterioration of fish Hg levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, M; Rastetter, EB; Fernandes, DN; Goulden, ML; Shaver, GR; Johnson, LC				Williams, M; Rastetter, EB; Fernandes, DN; Goulden, ML; Shaver, GR; Johnson, LC			Predicting gross primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Our goal was to construct a simple, highly aggregated model, driven by easily available data sets, that accurately predicted terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP; carboxylation plus oxygenation) in diverse environments and ecosystems. Our starting point was a fine-scale, multilayer model of half-hourly canopy processes that has been parametrized for Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Over varied growing season conditions, this fine-scale model predicted hourly carbon and latent energy fluxes that were in good agreement with data from eddy covariance studies. Using an heuristic process, we derived a simple aggregated set of equations operating on cumulative or average values of the most sensitive driving variables (leaf area index, mean foliar N concentration, canopy height, average daily temperature and temperature range, atmospheric transmittance, latitude, day of year, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and an index of soil moisture). We calibrated the aggregated model to provide estimates of GPP similar to those of the fine-scale modal across a wide range of these driving variables. Our calibration across this broad range of conditions captured 96% of fine-scale model behavior, but was computationally many orders of magnitude faster. We then tested the assumptions we had made in generating the aggregated model by applying it in different ecosystems. Using the same parameter values derived for Harvard Forest, the aggregated model made sound predictions of GPP for wet-sedge tundra in the Arctic under a variety of experimental manipulations, and also for a range of forest types across the OTTER (Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research) transect in Oregon, running from coastal Sitka spruce to high-plateau mountain juniper.					; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016; Goulden, Michael/B-9934-2008	Goulden, Michael/0000-0002-9379-3948; Rastetter, Edward/0000-0002-8620-5431; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; 													1051-0761	1939-5582				AUG	1997	7	3					882	894																WOS:A1997XQ08100011

Predicting the effects of reservoir water level management on the reproductive output of a riparian songbird	PLOS ONE												Dams and reservoirs alter natural water flow regimes with adverse effects on natural ecosystems. Quantifying and reducing these effects are important as global demands for energy and water, and the number of dams and reservoir, increase. However, costs and logistic constraints typically preclude experimental assessment of reservoir effects on the environment. We developed a stochastic individual-based model (IBM), parameterized using empirical data, to estimate the annual productivity of yellow warblers that breed in riparian habitat within the footprint of the Arrow Lakes Reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. The IBM incorporated information on breeding phenology, nest site selection, brood parasitism, daily nest survival, re-nesting probabilities and post-fledging survival. We used the IBM to estimate the effect of four different water management scenarios on annual productivity. We found that the IBM accurately estimated average nest success (0.39 +/- 0.10 SD), the proportion of females that produced at least one fledgling during a breeding season (0.56 +/- 0.11), and annual fledging success (2.06 +/- 0.43) under current conditions. The IBM estimated that reservoir operations currently reduce the annual productivity of this population by 37%, from an average of 1.62 to 1.06 independent young/female. Delaying when reservoir water levels reach 435m asl (the minimum elevation occupied by yellow warblers) by approximately 2 weeks was predicted to increase annual productivity to 1.44 independent young/female. The standardized effect on annual productivity of reducing the maximum elevation of the reservoir so that yellow warbler habitat is not inundated (Cohen's d = 1.52) or delaying when water is stored (Cohen's d = 0.83) was primarily driven by inundation effects on post-fledging survival. Reservoir operation effects on breeding birds will be species specific, but this IBM can easily be modified to allow the environmental impacts on the entire breeding bird community to be incorporated into water management decisions.

The number, positions, and volume of moraines formed all are sensitive to the climate history assumed. We drive the model with the GISP2 central-Greenland temperature record, and with reduced-millennial-amplitude versions of that record, to test the hypothesis that the Younger Dryas and other millennial oscillations were primarily wintertime events and thus had less influence on glacier behavior than did the Last Glacial Maximum with its strong summertime as well as wintertime signal. We find that forcing the model by GISP2, with dampened strength of the millennial-scale signal, provides modeled moraine configurations that reflect observed moraine records in the Northern Hemisphere.

Thus far, experimental evidence on the factors affecting food quality under natural conditions is scarce. Hence, in this study, we set out to investigate how Daphnia galeata x hyalina responded to qualitative variation in natural seston. This was done in laboratory experiments where we supplement natural seston from a mesotrophic lake with dissolved phosphorus and emulsions of highly unsaturated "essential" fatty acids. The growth rate of juveniles increased upon the supply of both phosphorus and fatty acids. These results suggest that these phosphorus and highly unsaturated fatty acids are substitutable and thus challenge our existing interpretation/understanding of how herbivore growth is "limited".

This review includes a comprehensive assessment of the concentration and distribution of legacy and emerging PFAS compounds in living species, such as plants and aquatic creatures, as well as in abiotic components, such as surface water and sediment within estuarine ecosystems. This paper also explores the temporal and seasonal patterns of PFAS emissions, as well as the fate of both long- and short-chain PFAS compounds. Furthermore, it discusses the partitioning behavior, bioaccumulation, and trophic magnification of PFAS in estuarine environments. PFAS are widespread in estuary sediment and surface water, and sediments continue to serve as a significant reservoir for these substances. The temporal trend suggests that the introduction of legislation and the gradual phaseout of some PFAS groups may have led to a decrease in their concentration levels. Elevated levels of PFAS in estuary aquatic animals and their ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic food webs could lead to long-term negative health effects on the surrounding population and ecosystem.

Application to the Amazon basin	COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE II FASCICULE A-SCIENCES DE LA TERRE ET DES PLANETES												Although developed and optimised for open oceans, satellite altimetry has the potential to monitor level variations of inland surface waters such as lakes and rivers. Here we present results of water level variations of the Amazon River based on eight years (1993-2000) of altimetry data of the Topex/Poseidon satellite. We first discuss methods to detect wet surfaces from the altimetric measurements, discriminate between water and dry land, and quantify the accuracy of altimetric measurements over water. Then we show water level fluctuations at selected locations where the satellite crosses the Amazon River. The dominant signal is seasonal, mostly annual, with an amplitude of up to 10-15 m peak to peak. Comparison with in situ measurements indicates that water levels are well measured by Topex/Poseidon during high-water season, unlike low-water season, which suffers from data gaps. We further discuss the interannual component of the signal, which shows two marked minima in 1995 and 1998. The 1998 minimum is interpreted as an effect of the 1997-1998 ENSO event, causing rainfall deficit in the central part of the Amazon basin, hence decrease in wafer levels. An EOF analysis of precipitation fields over the basin during the 1993-1999 period confirms the rainfall minimum by the end of 1997 for this region.

Length frequency distributions registered were different between males (5.4-6.7 cm) and females (6.1-8.1 cm). Significant differences of condition factor values between sexes were found, meaning different growth rates. The reproductive period occurred from October to March, as described for other characids of the same area. Terrestrial insects fragments, superior vegetables residue and aquatic insects larvae were the main food items consumed, indicating a pronounced dependence of the feeding on the allochthonous items imported from the riparian vegetation.

Intercalibration of research survey vessels on Lake Erie	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fish abundance indices obtained from annual research trawl surveys are an integral part of fisheries stock assessment and management in the Great Lakes. It is difficult, however, to administer trawl surveys using a single vessel-gear combination owing to the large size of these systems, the jurisdictional boundaries that bisect the Great Lakes, and changes in vessels as a result of fleet replacement. When trawl surveys are administered by multiple vessel-gear combinations, systematic error may be introduced in combining catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data across vessels. This bias is associated with relative differences in catchability among vessel-gear combinations. In Lake Erie, five different research vessels conduct seasonal trawl surveys in the western half of the lake. To eliminate this systematic bias, the Lake Erie agencies conducted a side-by-side trawling experiment in 2003 to develop correction factors for CPUE data associated with different vessel-gear combinations. Correcting for systematic bias in CPUE data should lead to more accurate and comparable estimates of species density and biomass. We estimated correction factors for the 10 most commonly collected species age-groups for each vessel during the experiment. Most of the correction factors (70%) ranged from 0.5 to 2.0, indicating that the systematic bias associated with different vessel-gear combinations was not large. Differences in CPUE were most evident for vessels using different sampling gears, although significant differences also existed for vessels using the same gears. These results suggest that standardizing gear is important for multiple-vessel surveys, but there will still be significant differences in catchability stemming from the vessel effects and agencies must correct for this. With standardized estimates of CPUE, the Lake Erie agencies will have the ability to directly compare and combine time series for species abundance.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2006	26	3					559	570		10.1577/M05-027.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-027.1													WOS:000240753900007

Recently, the lake's water has shown significant signs of eutrophication and contamination. In order to understand the change rules and driving factors behind of water quality degradation, this study conducted water quality monitoring and evaluation of the lake. The study results revealed that the water quality index (WQI) of Tianhe Lake ranged from 60.560 to 81.724, indicating overall water quality fluctuating between "good" and "moderate". The average trophic level index (TLI) of lake water was 63.23, characterized by moderate eutrophication. Influenced by climatic factors and anthropogenic activities, water quality exhibited significant seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics. Principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) results indicated that the key water quality indicators included Chlorophyll-a (Chla), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The minimal water quality index (WQImin) models developed using these five indicators and relative weights exhibited higher accuracy in water quality assessment, with the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 0.886 and 2.586, respectively. Pollution source apportionment analysis suggested that agricultural runoff and domestic sewage discharge were the predominant contributors to pollutant loads. Endogenous release of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from lake bottom sediments was identified as a secondary source. This study can enhance public awareness regarding safe water supply from small-scale reservoirs and provide new references and benefits for the environment management of plain reservoirs.

In this study, hydro-climatic factors, including precipitation (P), actual evaporation (Ea), land surface temperature (LST), snowmelt (SM), snowfall (SF), and the amount of agricultural and forest vegetation (Aveg, Fveg) on the Precipitation Efficiency changes (P-Ea) of the two mega basins of Great Karun and Karkheh in the west of Iran were investigated. Initially, reanalysis data (ERA5-Land), remote sensing data from the Landsat series (1985-2022), and data from 56 meteorological stations were collected. Then, the trend of monthly hydro-climatic data changes and the correlation between ground data and data derived from ERA5-Land were calculated. The results from the months of January-March (wet season) in both basins showed steeper temperature changes with a gradient of 0.05-0.1 degrees C/month. Nevertheless, a decreasing slope (- 0.23 to - 0.03 mm/month) was observed for P in the same months (January-March). The changes in streamflow rate at the outlet of the Great Karun Basin have decreased by about 50% (for Ahwaz station), 48% (at Tange-Panj station), and about 80% in the Karkheh river flow during the studied period. The results of this research showed that the combination of ground and remote sensing data can provide a comprehensive view of the water resources status of the mega basins that undergo human interventions to manage the risk caused by water stresses. In addition, the findings are important basis for quantifying changes in the water balance to respond to changes in hydro-climatic factors.					; Sharif, Morteza/JAN-4944-2023; Hosseini, Seiyed Mossa/AAJ-1257-2020	Hosseini, Seiyed Mossa/0000-0001-7161-8711; Sharif, Morteza/0000-0001-6531-5933; 													1735-6865	2008-2304				JUN	2025	19	3							87	10.1007/s41742-025-00750-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41742-025-00750-6													WOS:001432605900005

Study focus: This study investigates the pollution levels, potential sources, and human health risks associated with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in groundwater using an integrated approach combining index-based models and chemometric analysis. New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicate that Pb, Fe, Mn, and Cd are the key contaminants, with no significant seasonal variations. Pollution indices (Cdeg, HEI, HPI, and mHPI) classify groundwater as less polluted in upgradient areas and highly polluted in downgradient zones. Human health risk assessment (HHRA) reveals significant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks (mean HI > 1 for both adults and children; mean CR > 1.0 x 10(-3) for adults, and > 1.0 x 10(-4) for children). As, Cd, Mn, and Pb are key the contributors to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks and potential risks of chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu). Correlation analysis suggests distinct geochemical behaviours of PTEs. Principal Component Analysis/Factor Analysis (PCA/FA) and R-mode Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) identify mixed sources, including industrial and domestic discharges as well as agricultural activities, as major contributors to groundwater contamination. These findings provide critical insights for policymakers, stakeholders and regulatory institutions to develop effective strategies for sustainable groundwater resource management in the region.					; Lawal, Ibrahim Mohammed/GZG-9546-2022; Shuaibu, Abdulrahman/HJH-3755-2023	Chitsundi Banda, Limbikani/0000-0002-0449-5974; Shuaibu, Abdulrahman/0000-0003-1679-0572; 														2214-5818				JUN	2025	59								102439	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102439													WOS:001490649400001

Hydro-physical processes at the plunge point: an analysis using satellite and in situ data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The plunge point is the main mixing point between river and epilimnetic reservoir water. Plunge point monitoring is essential for understanding the behavior of density currents and their implications for reservoir. The use of satellite imagery products from different sensors (Landsat TM band 6 thermal signatures and visible channels) for the characterization of the river-reservoir transition zone is presented in this study. It is demonstrated the feasibility of using Landsat TM band imagery to discern the subsurface river plumes and the plunge point. The spatial variability of the plunge point evident in the hydrologic data illustrates the advantages of synoptic satellite measurements over in situ point measurements alone to detect the river-reservoir transition zone. During the dry season, when the river-reservoir water temperature differences vanish and the river circulation is characterized by interflow-overflow, the river water inserts into the upper layers of the reservoir, affecting water quality. The results indicate a good agreement between hydrologic and satellite data and that the joint use of thermal and visible channel data for the operational monitoring of a plunge point is feasible. The deduced information about the density current from this study could potentially be assimilated into numerical models and hence be of significant interest for environmental and climatological research.

The elements considered were: Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn. This research was carried out at a site where various other studies have been conducted on important characteristics of the same population of Unio. This site is a small bay called "Sabbie d'Oro" located on the south-cost coast of Lake Maggiore. Our study involved quantifying the capacity of this mollusc to concentrate large amounts of metal in its body without evident consequences by using detoxification mechanisms. We analysed not only element concentrations, but also their variability (expressed as CM) in the soft tissues and in the shell, for two main reasons: i) the sampling design should include a preliminary analysis to determine how Many specimens is necessary collect to ensure a specified level of precision: ii,) the sample variability value may be combined with the value of analytical precision (BCR) to obtain an estimate of the "experimental" precision. In soft tissue, Ca accumulation tended to increase with size, and AI accumulation decreased with size. In shell. Ca and Ni were stored more than in soft tissue, but not proportionally to size. V, Cr and Mo tended to accumulate in the shell progressively over the years, whereas Co and Al are "diluted" during growth. or are absorbed mainly during the juvenile stage. Partition between shell and soft tissue resulted roughly the same in the juvenile and adult stages for the following elements: Fe, Al, Co, As, Pb. The relationships among the various elements were schematized in a hierarchical tree plot.

The diets of three closely related zooplanktivorous silversides belonging to the Atherinopsidae species flock of lake Chapala, Mexico, were analyzed at two sites (Chirostoma jordani, C. labarcae, and C. consocium). Diets were described in critical shallow (August 2000) and volume recovery conditions (August 2005). Diets included mainly cladocerans (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, and Daphnia) and copepods (Cyclops). A significant difference in diets was detected when comparing years (MRPP analysis, A = 0.22, p < 0.0001) and sites at different years (MRPP analysis, A = 0.17, p = 0.004). According to niche breadth mean values, species were classified as specialized and intermediate feeders. In shallow conditions, the small range of niche breadth (1.72 to 3.64) and high diet overlap values (D = 0.64, L = 8.62) indicated a high potential for interspecific exploitative interaction. When the lake volume recovered, an increase in the niche breadth range (1.04 to 4.96) and low niche overlap values (D = 0.53, L = 2.32) indicated a reduction of the species interaction. The Mann-Whitney U-test supported this pattern by showing a significant difference between years for niche overlap (p = 0.006). The increased interaction during the low volume suggests alternative segregation in life-history variations and other niche dimensions such as spatial or temporal distribution.

Movement of Lake-Origin Burbot Reared in a Hatchery Environment and Released into a Large River Drainage	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Burbot Lota lota in Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River of British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana (U.S. spelling: oKootenai Rivero) are at risk of demographic extinction. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate poststocking dispersal and movement of hatchery-reared, lake-strain burbot (Moyie Lake, British Columbia) in a riverine environment to determine the potential utility of this hatchery strain for future burbot rehabilitation efforts in this system. We implanted ultrasonic tags into 30 hatchery-reared burbot (ages 2 and 3) and released them into the Goat River, a tributary to the Kootenay River, in October 2009. Dispersal over a distance of 2 km from the Goat River release site to the Kootenay River occurred within 1-9 d after release (mean = 3.1 d; n = 28 active tags). Thereafter, 14 burbot remained in the Kootenay River for the rest of the 144-d study period; nine of these fish were observed moving upstream from the Goat River confluence, and five were observed both upstream and downstream from the confluence. The other 14 burbot were observed in Kootenay Lake; of these fish, eight were detected in the lake for the duration of the study, and six were observed to move regularly between the lake and the river. Dispersal distances (distance between the upstream-most and downstream-most detections per individual) within the Kootenay River ranged from 10 to 138 km (mean = 80 km), and tagged fish were detected over a 236-km reach (from 135 km downstream to 101 km upstream of the Goat River confluence). We also observed burbot in the vicinity of known spawning locations during the February spawning season. The observed dispersal suggests that a limited number of stocking locations may be sufficient to allow burbot to access available habitats within a few months postrelease. Our observations therefore suggest that lake-origin, hatchery-reared burbot may be suitable for stocking in a riverine environment.					; CAIN, KEN/ABC-2818-2020	Cain, Kenneth/0000-0002-9488-0461; 													0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	1					56	62	PII 934656386	10.1080/02755947.2011.557969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.557969													WOS:000288279800006

Silicon Isotopes as Tracers of Terrestrial Processes	HANDBOOK OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY, VOLS 1 AND 2	Advances in Isotope Geochemisty											Chemical weathering of silicate rocks consumes carbon dioxide during the breakdown of minerals and liberates ions and silicic acid. Weathering reactions can lead to the fractionation of stable silicon (Si) isotopes, which allows variations in Si isotopic ratios to be used to quantify the global Si cycle. Here, I detail the methods and applications of assessing variations in continental Si stable isotope compositions, and show how such studies can elucidate the processes that affect the terrestrial Si cycle. The global Si cycle and its stable isotope variations are strongly affected by biology, with Si uptake by phytoplankton in oceans and lakes, and biological uptake by terrestrial plants, especially modern crops, on land. This biological uptake and subsequent release often leads to a strong seasonal cycle overprinted onto the underlying weathering reactions. Nevertheless, it can be shown that weathering reactions lead to the fractionation of Si into a light Si reservoir stored in soils and sedimentary basins, and a heavy Si reservoir in rivers, lakes and the oceans.																					978-3-642-10636-1				2011							87	104		10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8_6	10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8												WOS:000301099200006

The interplay between environmental conditions and Allee effects during the recovery of stressed zooplankton communities	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Many important ecological phenomena depend on the success or failure of small introduced populations. Several factors are thought to influence the fate of small populations, including resource and habitat availability, dispersal levels, interspecific interactions, mate limitation, and demographic stochasticity. Recent field studies suggest that Allee effects resulting from mate limitation can prevent the reestablishment of sexual zooplankton species following a disturbance. In this study, we explore the interplay between Allee effects and local environmental conditions in determining the population growth and establishment of two acid-sensitive zooplankton species that have been impacted by regional anthropogenic acidification. We conducted a factorial design field experiment to test the impact of pH and initial organism densities on the per capita population growth (r) of the sexual copepod Epischura lacustris and the seasonally parthenogenetic cladoceran Daphnia mendotae. In addition, we conducted computer simulations using r values obtained from our experiments to determine the probability of extinction for small populations of acid-sensitive colonists that are in the process of colonizing recovering lakes. The results of our field experiment demonstrated that local environmental conditions can moderate the impacts of Allee effects for E. lacustris: Populations introduced at low densities had a significantly lower r at pH 6 than at pH 7. In contrast, r did not differ between pH 6 and 7 environments when E. lacustris populations were introduced at high densities. D. mendotae was affected by pH levels, but not by initial organism densities. Results from our population growth simulations indicated that E. lacustris populations introduced at low densities to pH 6 conditions had a higher probability of extinction than those introduced at low densities to a pH 7 environment. Our study indicates that environmental conditions and mate limitation can interact to determine the fate of small populations of sexually reproducing zooplankton species. If a more rapid recovery of acid-damaged zooplankton communities is desired, augmentation of dispersal levels may be needed during the early phases of pH recovery in order to increase the probability of establishment for mate-limited zooplankton species.

J	Henderson, BA; Morgan, GE				Henderson, BA; Morgan, GE			Maturation of walleye by age, size and surplus energy	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The probability of annual sexual maturation by male and female walleye Stizostedion vitreum was related to age, size and an index of condition, I-VF=[arcsine(visceral fat)(0.5)(body mass)(-0.5)]. Most males first matured at ages 2 and 3 years; size explained first maturation, but condition explained later maturation. In contrast, most females first matured at ages 4 and 5 years; maturity of females was more dependent upon condition. Maturity of females at ages 4 and 5 years was significantly correlated with average I-VF of the population (PIVF). The size reached by age 2 years (early growth) was correlated with the PIVF. Growing degree-days, Secchi depth, latitude and lake morphology were not correlated with the PIVF. Annual variations in female spawning stock size were related to the condition of the females, presumably reflecting the net acquisition of energy in the preceding growing season. Annual variations within lakes in the net acquisition of energy may exceed the variations in energy availability between lakes, dictated by lake morphology and geography. Thus, assessment of condition could be used to predict annual potential spawning stock size and egg production. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

While microbial communities constitute the resilient power of lake ecosystems to CyanoHAB disturbances, the role of fungi remains underexplored. Here, the dynamics of size-fractionated fungal and associated bacterial communities were tracked across the peak and decline stages of a CyanoHAB event in shallow subtropical Lake Taihu. The results revealed that the composition of fungal and bacterial communities in separated size fractions varied between bloom stages, with enrichment patterns likely influenced by their reliance on algal-derived nutrients. Null model-based analysis revealed a shift in fungal community assembly, from dominance by dispersal limitation (44%) and drift (30%) at the peak stage to increased homogeneous selection (44%) at the early decline stage, whereas bacterial communities remained predominantly shaped by stochastic processes, highlighting their distinct responses to cyanobacterial biomass decomposition. Comparative topological analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks showed strengthened cross-kingdom fungi-bacteria interactions as the bloom declined, especially within decomposing cyanobacterial colonies, facilitating nutrient cycling and accelerating cyanobacterial biomass removal. These findings led to a conceptual model proposing fungi as critical members of the freshwater microbiome in eutrophic lakes, driving biogeochemical cycling and potentially contributing to the resilience of the lake ecosystem against CyanoHABs.					; Zhao, Ze/AAA-3206-2020; JU, Feng/I-8437-2016; Yang, Yuyi/N-5428-2015; Yang, Yuyi/H-6600-2015	Ju, Feng/0000-0003-4137-5928; ?, ?/0000-0002-7584-0632; Yang, Yuyi/0000-0001-9807-6844													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 28	2025	59	22					11167	11180		10.1021/acs.est.4c09164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09164		MAY 2025						40434797					WOS:001497986400001
J	Leicht-Young, SA; Pavlovic, NB; Grundel, R				Leicht-Young, Stacey A.; Pavlovic, Noel B.; Grundel, Ralph			Susceptibility of eastern US habitats to invasion of Celastrus orbiculatus (oriental bittersweet) following fire	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Fire effects on invasive species are an important land management issue in areas subjected to prescribed fires as well as wildfires. These effects on invasive species can be manifested across life stages. The liana Celastrus orbiculatus (oriental bittersweet) is a widespread invader of eastern US habitats including those where fire management is in practice. This study examined if prescribed fire makes these habitats more susceptible to invasion of C orbiculatus by seed at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Four treatments (control, litter removed, high and low intensity fire) were applied in six habitat types (sand savanna/woodland, sand prairie, moraine prairie, sand oak forest, beech-maple forest, and oak-hickory forest) and germinating seedlings were tracked over two growing seasons. Treatment did not have a significant effect on the germination, survival, or biomass of C orbiculatus. However, habitat type did influence these responses mostly in the first growing season. Moraine prairie, beech-maple forest, and oak-hickory forests had the greatest peak percentage of germinants. Moraine prairie had significantly greater survival than oak forest and savanna habitats. Control plots with intact litter, and the moraine prairie habitat had the tallest seedlings at germination, while tallest final heights and greatest aboveground biomass were highest in oak forest. Thus, fire and litter removal did not increase the susceptibility of these habitats to germination and survival of C orbiculatus. These results indicate that most eastern US habitats are vulnerable to invasion by this species via seed regardless of the level or type of disturbance to the litter layer.

J	Panzenböck, M				Panzenboeck, Michaela			Effect of solar radiation on photosynthetic extracellular carbon release and its microbial utilization in alpine and Arctic lakes	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effect of solar radiation (photosynthetically active radiation and ultraviolet radiation [UVR]) on the photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) of phytoplankton and its utilization by bacterioplankton were studied in an alpine lake (Gossenkollesee, Austria) over a seasonal cycle. For comparison, 2 Arctic lakes on the Taymir Peninsula (Siberia) were investigated as well. The contribution of PER to primary production (% net PER) ranged between 0 and 95 % (mean 32 %) in Gossenkollesee (May 1999 to July 2000) following a seasonal trend that was inversely related to phytoplankton biomass. PER was released only under light conditions and was positively related to the intensity of solar radiation. During the ice-covered period, the % net PER increased, while total primary production (P-tot) decreased with experimentally increasing irradiance, indicating radiation-induced stress with dark-adapted phytoplankton. During the ice-free period, the increase of % net PER with increasing irradiance was independent of photoinhibition. The fraction of PER not immediately incorporated by bacteria (similar to 60 % of total PER) may be an important contribution to the generally low pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Gossenkollesee. At the Arctic site, net PER amounted to 21 % of P-tot in an ice-free lake and 51 % in the ice-covered Lake Nyagamya, In all lakes, the amount of PER was sufficient to meet the bacterial carbon demand. The UVR-induced inhibition of primary production in the investigated lakes was inversely related to the DOC concentration of the water column, with the lowest effect in the ice-free Arctic lake (3.5% reduction of P-tot) and the highest impact in the alpine lake (56 % reduction of P-tot, 61 % reduction of PER); the percentage of net PER was apparently not controlled by UVR. This suggests that the investigated alpine lake is more sensitive to changes in UVR than the Arctic lakes are.																			0948-3055					JUL 10	2007	48	2					155	168		10.3354/ame048155	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame048155													WOS:000248518700006

Membrane performance was demonstrated in terms of DOC, biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC), and transport parameters. Various membranes such as reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) were investigated for this study. Four different NF membranes were selected for pilot-scale filtration testing and investigated in terms of both flux decline and DOC removal. To demonstrate the effect of temperature on the source water seasonally, the flux of membranes was measured with pure water at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 7 degrees C. Coagulation/sedimentation treated water was used as feed water without removing residual chlorine; related plants were located at the Suji water treatment plant of Yongin City. To investigate more rigorously the organic fouling for various NF membranes, mass transport behaviors of organic matter solutes were evaluated by an irreversible thermodynamic model. The pore sizes of the NF membranes tested in the pilot slightly increased due to the oxidation of the polymer structure of the membranes from residual chlorine during the 4-month tests.

J	Sharpe, SE; Bright, J				Sharpe, Saxon E.; Bright, Jordon			A high-elevation MIS 5 hydrologic record using mollusks and ostracodes from Snowmass Village, Colorado, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Sediments containing terrestrial and aquatic mollusks and ostracodes from the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site (2705 m elevation) near Snowmass Village, Colorado, span similar to 130-87 ka (MIS 5e through 5b). The southeastern area of the site where taxa were recovered was a relatively fresh, shallow, well-vegetated wetland during MIS 5e through 5c time, approximately 2 m deep, with a total dissolved solids value of similar to 200-1000 mg L-1. The wetland was seasonally or annually variable and groundwater discharged along the margins of the bounding moraine. Groundwater likely contributed solutes to the system and may have contributed O-18-enriched water. Based on stable isotopes from ostracode calcite (delta O-18(OST) and delta C-13(OST)), seasonal evaporation occurred and the dissolved inorganic carbon pool was unexpectedly enriched in C-13. The mollusk and ostracode faunas changed little across the MIS 5e/5d/5c boundaries, whereas a distinct change in the ostracode fauna occurred between the deposition of Unit 11 and Unit 13, which corresponds in time to the MIS 5c/5b boundary, indicating some combination of increased surface and/or groundwater flow, a decrease in water temperature, and a freshening and a possible deepening of the wetland.

Understanding the factors influencing soil salinization is crucial for soil management and improvement. However, the sensitivity of soil salinization to seasonal changes has not been thoroughly studied in arid regions. Therefore, this study focuses on the Yanqi Basin, where 129 soil samples were collected (wet season of 51, dry season of 78) for laboratory analysis to determine the soil saturated extract conductivity (ECe). Soil salinity feature variables were extracted from Sentinel-1 radar remote sensing data, Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and digital elevation models (DEM). The Boruta algorithm was used to select feature variables, and the optimal feature variables were combined with Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to construct prediction models. The results indicate: (1) Red-edge spectral features (RE) can effectively predict soil salinization. In addition, the variables most correlated with ECe are elevation (DEM) and river network baseline (CNBL), mainly because the terrain in the study area is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast, with flat farmland in the central region, where the movement of water and salt is significantly influenced by the terrain. (2) The RF model is the best prediction model in this study, with R2 = 0.78, effectively revealing the spatial distribution of soil salinity during both the wet and dry seasons. (3) The degree of salinization in the wet season is significantly higher than in the dry season due to the combined effects of higher precipitation, lower vegetation cover, evaporation, and salt migration. (4) During both the dry and wet seasons, salinized soil is mainly concentrated along the shores of Bosten Lake, the Kaidu River, and Huangshui Ditch, while light salinization is distributed in the Gobi Desert areas. This study provides scientific evidence for the management and improvement of soil salinization caused by seasonal changes in arid regions.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 30	2025	36	12					4290	4303		10.1002/ldr.5635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5635		MAY 2025											WOS:001492634300001
J	Teubner, K; Dokulil, MT				Teubner, K; Dokulil, MT			Ecological stoichiometry of TN:TP:SRSi in freshwaters: nutrient ratios and seasonal shifts in phytoplankton assemblages	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Our concept of the "balance of TN: TP: SRSi-ratios" attempts to determine whether the seasonal succession of phytoplankton communities is influenced by or responds to nutrient stoichiometry. Because the molar average of TN : TP : SRSi = 20: 1:17 for 118 measurements (7 lakes, 3 inflows. all seasons) was close to the marine optimum stoichiometric ratio, we used the ratio TN: TP: SRSi = 16: 1:17 as a reference point for ecological stoichiometry. Triangular diagrams of TN: TP: SRSi ratios scaled in physiological proportions of 16: 1: 17 were used to identify seasonal fluctuation patterns of major phytoplankton nutrients. In takes with 'balanced nutrient ratios' TN: TP: SRSi ratios vary evenly around the stoichiometric optimum of 16: 1: 17 within a year. Lakes with balanced nutrient ratios, however, were more the exception than the rule and only occurred in 2 of 7 lakes studied. Lakes with constant concentrations of one nutrient element in relation to those of the other two were common. Unbalanced nutrient ratios were associated with relatively constant concentrations of either SRSi, or TN or TP. The relative change in availability of soluble reactive silica was more affected by differences in lake morphometry than that of TN or TP. Ratios of TN: TP: SRSi have the advantage of synoptically presenting the relative nutrient availability for both diatoms and non-siliceous algae in phytoplankton communities. Shifts within the tripartite ratio correspond to successive substitution of phytoplankton groups, e.g. from diatoms to cyanobacteria.

In this paper, we 1) studied the sequence of development of the reproductive system of Girardia capacivasa Sluys & Kawakatsu, 2005 (Dugesiidae), to estimate the onset of sexual maturity, applying the logistic regressions for the first time in flatworms; and 2) assessed reproductive and population patterns of this freshwater flatworm, and their responses to water temperature variation in a temperate Neotropical stream. These appraisals allowed us to test if the life history traits of freshwater planarians are similar in regions with marked temperature seasonality. According to the degree of development of the gonads and copulatory apparatus the development of the reproductive system was classified in five stages. The estimated size at the onset of sexual maturity was 12 mm. We found no relationship between the density of G. capacivasa and temperature, but planarians were more gregarious in warmer months. The largest planarians were recorded in cold months. The reproductive effort during the warm season was higher, but cocoons and juveniles were found throughout the study period, indicating continuous reproduction. Hence, the temperature variation recorded in the study area was not a limiting factor for breeding but influenced the body size and spatial distribution pattern of G. capacivasa.

Sedimentological characterization of a Distributive Fluvial System of arid climates: arroyo Papagayos, eastern piedmont of La Huerta-Las Imanas Ranges, San Juan, Argentina	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												Recent studies proposed that distributive fluvial systems (DFS) occupy a great proportion in modern continental sedimentary basins, challenging classical sedimentary models proposed for similar ancient basin. Because of this, arises the importance of studying modern DFS with the aim of obtaining facial models to apply them in ancient deposits. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the sedimentary environments included in the modern deposits of the Arroyo Papagayos, Western Pampean Ranges, San Juan province, interpreted as a Distributive Fluvial System (DFS). We perform the study of the Papagayos creek by describing different architectural elements, which characterize the sub-environments organized in four zones from the mountain front to the distal playa lake. A low sinuosity gravelly-sandy bed braided fluvial system, characterizes the proximal zone. A medial to high sinuosity sandy-gravelly anastomosed-anabranching fluvial system describes the medial zone, where floodplain aggradation is domain by crevasse splays accretion. At this point, 10 km far from the mountain front, the deposits starts to develop a cone shaped morphology. A higher sinuosity flashy ephemeral meandering sandymuddy fluvial system with eolian interaction defines the distal zone, where the main channel of the system disappears by low gradient of the topography and infiltration depositing muddy terminal splays. Finally, eolian dune and wet interdune deposits characterizes the fourth zone, interpreted as a transitional area between the DFS and the saline playa lake. A particular feature observed along the DFS system is that mudflows are the main sedimentary process in the floodplain, probably as the result of the combination of the seasonal arid climate and the Arroyo Papagayos drainage basin morphometry and the low gradient of the topography. The sedimentary process and environments recognized along the Arroyo Papagayos will allow a better understanding of arid DFS depositional dynamics as well as, to identify them in the geological record. Lastly, high aggrading conditions for DFS development will response to climate interaction between upland catchment area (semiarid) and valley (arid), drainage basin morphometry, smooth piedmont gradient and high tectonic subsidence of the basin, located in the Andean broken foreland.																			0718-7106					MAY	2018	45	2					186	228		10.5027/andgeoV45n2-3022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV45n2-3022													WOS:000433896800005

Variable host phenology does not pose a barrier to invasive weevils in a northern hardwood forest	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 A suite of invasive weevils has established in hardwood forests of the North American Great Lakes Region. We quantified patterns of host availability and the capacity of adults to succeed in a system with high host variability both within and between seasons in Michigan, U.S.A. 2 We quantified phenological development of foliage on three host species [sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marshall; ironwood, Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch; and raspberry, Rubus spp.]. We estimated adult abundance using emergence traps and sweep net sampling over 3 years, and compared field host associations with laboratory choice assays. 3 Host plant phenology varied among species, between years, and in their interactions. The four most common weevils, Phyllobius oblongus (L.), Polydrusus sericeus (Schaller), Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and Sciaphilus asperatus (Bonsdorff), emerged in early to mid-June, in approximately that order. After emergence, each species showed evidence of host preference based on their abundances on foliage. Overall, P. oblongus and B. pellucidus were most prevalent on sugar maple, P. sericeus was most prevalent on ironwood, and S. asperatus was relatively evenly distributed. Laboratory choice tests with P. oblongus and P. sericeus confirmed these preferences. 4 These four invasive species comprised over 99% of all 12 845 weevils obtained, suggesting displacement of native species. The optimal sampling methods varied among weevil species. 5 These invasive weevils contend with the highly variable conditions of their environment, and also potential phenological asynchrony, via relatively late emergence, even at the cost of lower host quality. Annual variation is greater for numbers of adults than larvae, suggesting that mortality of late instars or pupae is particularly important.

The largest proportion of photodependent N-2 fixation was associated with the macrophyte Chara vulgaris in both years and at both locations. The nitrogen fixation rate associated with Chara always represented more than 45% of the global nitrogenase activity measured in the rice field. The estimated average N-2 fixation rate associated with Chara was 27.53 kg of N ha(-1) crop(-1). The mean estimated N, fixation rates for the other parts of the system for all sampling periods were as follows: soil, 4.07 kg of N ha(-1) crop(-1); submerged parts of rice plants, 3.93 kg of N ha(-1) crop(-1); and roots, 0.28 kg of N ha(-1) crop(-1). Micrographic studies revealed the presence of epiphytic cyanobacteria on the surface of Chara. Three-dimensional reconstructions by confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed no cyanobacterial cells inside the Chara structures. Quantification of epiphytic cyanobacteria by image analysis revealed that cyanobacteria were more abundant in nodes than in internodes (on average, cyanobacteria covered 8.4% +/- 4.4% and 6.2% +/- 5.0% of the surface area in the nodes and internodes, respectively). Epiphytic cyanobacteria were also quantified by using a fluorometer. This made it possible to discriminate which algal groups were the source of chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a measurements confirmed that cyanobacteria were more abundant in nodes than in internodes (on average, the chlorophyll a concentrations were 17.2 +/- 28.0 and 4.0 +/- 3.8 mug mg [dry weight] of Chara(-1) in the nodes and internodes, respectively). These results indicate that this macrophyte, which is usually considered a weed in the context of rice cultivation, may help maintain soil N fertility in the rice field ecosystem.					; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013	Carrasco, David/0000-0002-0551-820X; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993													0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2004	70	9					5391	5397		10.1128/AEM.70.9.5391-5397.2004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.9.5391-5397.2004								15345425					WOS:000223901100044
J	Dumitru, C; Sprules, WG; Yan, ND				Dumitru, C; Sprules, WG; Yan, ND			Impact of Bythotrephes longimanus on zooplankton assemblages of Harp Lake, Canada:: an assessment based on predator consumption and prey production	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Following the 1993 invasion of Harp Lake by Bythotrephes longimanus a number of small-bodied zooplankton declined dramatically compared to pre-invasion densities, and some larger species increased. 2. To test whether these changes were caused by Bythotrephes, we measured its consumption of zooplankton in 1995 and compared this to production by the prey species with which it overlapped spatially and temporally. 3. On a seasonal basis Bythotrephes consumption was 199 mg dry mass (DM) m(-2) 25% of zooplankton production which was 783 mg DW m(-2). However, for some species, such as the small copepod Tropocyclops extensus, consumption greatly exceeded production-this was one of the species noted to decline in Harp Lake following the appearance of Bythotrephes. By contrast, for the larger cladocerans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Holopedium gibberum, consumption was much less than production-these species were observed to increase following the invasion. 4. Our results thus support the hypothesis that zooplankton changes in Harp Lake were caused by Bythotrephes. We speculate that lower quality prey remaining in Harp Lake may lead to reduced densities of Bythotrephes, or impose strong selective forces that lead to new adaptations by this predator.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0046-5070					FEB	2001	46	2					241	251		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00649.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00649.x													WOS:000167146200008

Identifying the host sources of ARG contamination and distinguishing whether the increased abundance of ARGs in the environment is due to on-site selection or the result of fecal contamination can effectively protect water quality and predict human health risks. In this study, the occurrence of 5 ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetO, tetW, and ermF), 1 mobile element intI1 and 7 microbial source tracker (MST) markers (CPQ_064, BacHum, Rum-2-Bac, BacCow, P.ND5, Pig-1-Bac, and GFD) was analyzed in the Chishui River watershed of Southwest China. The results showed that the detection frequencies of most ARGs exceeded 90% except for tetO. The abundance of the ARGs was higher in sediments than those in water. There was no significant difference in the ARG abundance in the sediments between the dry season and wet season, but the abundance of most ARGs in water during the dry season was significantly higher than those of the wet season. For MST markers, the abundance was also higher in sediments than that in water. Temporal distribution analysis showed that the abundance of most MST markers in water during the dry season was higher than that of the wet season, but the opposite result was found in sediments. Correlation analysis revealed that the prevalence of most ARGs in water was largely attributed to human fecal contamination. The results suggested that ruminant fecal contamination was a significant contributor to the distribution of tetW and ermF in water. In contrast, ARGs showed poor correlation with most MST markers in the sediments. Considering the lower specificity of Pig-1-Bac and ruminant-associated markers (Rum-2-Bac and BacCow), as well as the different decay rates between two human-associated markers (CPQ_064 and BacHum), the accuracy of ARG source tracking may be affected. Thus, this study suggested that multiple MST markers should be applied simultaneously to characterize ARGs sources. These findings provide critical guidance for mitigating ARG dissemination in agricultural and rural regions reliant on surface water, where fecal contamination poses dual threats to drinking safety and livestock productivity.

J	Carrasco, NK; Perissinotto, R				Carrasco, Nicola K.; Perissinotto, Renzo			In situ feeding rates and grazing impact of Mesopodopsis africana O. Tattersall in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Mesopodopsis africana is an important mysid in southern African coastal zooplankton and a key species in the St Lucia estuarine lake, which is currently undergoing severe desiccation owing to freshwater deprivation. M. africana populations through much of the system are consequently under severe environmental stress. This study investigates the grazing dynamics of this mysid species, in relation to autotrophic food availability and other environmental constraints in two contrasting areas of the St Lucia Estuary, Charters Creek, heavily affected by the desiccation process and the Mouth, virtually under unchanged conditions. Gut evacuation experiments were conducted once each during the day and the night. Evacuation rates were consistently higher during the night, ranging from 0.27 to 0.33 h(-1) at Charters Creek and from 1.13 to 1.24 h(-1) at the Mouth. Ingestion rates were, therefore, higher at the Mouth resulting in population grazing impacts of 2.5% of the total microalgal biomass, while the grazing impact at Charters Creek was only 0.5%. The spatial variation in ingestion rates could be attributed to seasonal differences in gut evacuation rates, differences in the mean size of mysids used, or the physicochemical conditions present at the two stations. It is suggested that mysid populations at Charters Creek are predominantly driven by bottom-up forces, initiated by the harsh environmental conditions. Despite the lower ingestion rates exhibited at Charters Creek, results indicate that these mysids are capable of meeting all their energetic requirements from a microalgal diet alone, although they may also utilise a heterotrophic diet.

The cave opens at an altitude of 1450 m on the steep southern slope of the Monte Generoso Massif between the Lugano and the Como lakes and forms a complex group of narrow galleries and inner chambers. Sedimentological and palaeontological data and radiocarbon dates place both the cave-bear and the human frequentations in the first part of the isotopic stage 3 with climatic conditions shifting from cool and dry to more temperate and wet. Environment progressively changed from scarcely arboreal to arboreal-brush with small open spaces. Few flakes and Levallois flakes have been recovered scattered in the sediment and affected in most cases by intense postdepositional alteration. These items testify incursions of mousterian groups equipped with endproducts and radiolarite flakes struck from blocks provisioned at lower locations southwards. End-products, namely Levallois flakes, prove that lithic reduction sequences were spatiotemporally fractionated in the covered territory. Conversely, it cannot be excluded a priori that sublocal radiolarite has been chipped at the entrance of the cave or at the very close surroundings for extraction of rudimental tools for immediate use. It is worth to mention that the small chert slabs in the Moltrasio limestone which crop throughout the cave walls were totally ignored. Caverna Generosa can be viewed as a refugia-location used in function of more or less constrained factors strongly influenced by high-altitude and bioclimatic situations. This type of site might well be integrated within the seasonal movements of humans in the western Lombard Pre-Alps area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

J	Wang, JZ; Georgakakos, KP				Wang, Jianzhong; Georgakakos, Konstantine P.			Estimation of potential evapotranspiration in the mountainous Panama Canal watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Spatially distributed hydrometeorological and plant information within the mountainous tropical Panama Canal watershed is used to estimate parameters of the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration formulation. Hydrometeorological data from a few surface climate stations located at low elevations in the watershed are complemented by (a) typical wet- and dry-season fields of temperature, wind, water vapour and pressure produced by a mesoscale atmospheric model with a 3 x 3 km(2) spatial and hourly temporal resolution, and (b) leaf area index fields estimated over the watershed during a few years using satellite data with two different spatial and temporal resolutions. The mesoscale model estimates of spatially distributed surface hydrometeorological variables provide the basis for the extrapolation of the surface climate station data to produce input for the Penman-Monteith equation. The satellite information and existing digital spatial databases of land use and land cover form the basis for the estimation of Penman-Monteith spatially distributed parameter values. Spatially distributed 3 x 3 km(2) potential evapotranspiration estimates are obtained for the 3300 km(2) Panama Canal watershed. Estimates for Gatun Lake within the watershed are found to reproduce well the monthly and annual lake evaporation obtained from submerged pans. Sensitivity analysis results of potential evapotranspiration estimates with respect to cloud cover, dew formation, leaf area index distribution and mesoscale model estimates of surface climate are presented and discussed. The main conclusion is that even the limited spatially distributed hydro meteorological and plant information used in this study contributes significantly toward explaining the substantial spatial variability of potential evapotranspiration in the watershed. These results also allow the determination of key locations within the watershed where additional surface stations may be profitably placed.

The model simulated daily growth, mortality, movement and spawning of individuals within a reach of stream. Juvenile and adult growth was based on consumption bioenergetics of benthic macroinvertebrate prey; benthic macroinvertebrate densities were a function of flow, season, and habitat quality. We based mortality rates of individual sculpin on their condition. Fish movement was determined by a growth maximization rule. We adjusted selected parameters to calibrate the model for a sculpin population in a southern Appalachian stream, in terms of adult and juvenile abundance and mean adult weight and length. Sensitivity and correlation analysis of the calibrated model suggested that this population was regulated by overwinter density-dependence among juveniles and adults. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Brady, SP; Benoit, G				Brady, Steven P.; Benoit, Gaboury			Freshwater Salinization of Seasonal Ponds: High Salinity and Stratification Threaten Critical, Overlooked Habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nearly a century of road salt use in the snowbelt region of North America has led to substantial increases in salinity levels in freshwater habitats. Salt pollution in lakes and rivers is well characterized. Lacking are broad insights for seasonal ponds. As critical habitats for many endemic species, these small and often poorly flushed surface waters are especially vulnerable to accumulating high levels of salts and other pollutants. Here, we measured salinity in 165 seasonal ponds, characterizing salt pollution patterns across space, through time, and over depth within ponds. We found that 70% of ponds within 37 m of a road contained salinity levels exceeding Canadian federal guidelines. 54% of ponds within 25 m exceeded less conservative US federal guidelines. Within ponds, the water column was stratified due to the combined density effects of salt and temperature. Bottom waters of polluted ponds were about 57% saltier than near-surface waters, though many were much saltier than this. Compared to lakes and rivers, far more seasonal ponds appear to be compromised by deicing salt, and overall, the concentration of salt appears to be substantially higher. Among aquatic habitats, seasonal ponds are experiencing the most severe impacts of freshwater salinization, with consequent impacts on sensitive aquatic organisms.

J	Leslie, DE; McBrearty, S; Hartman, G				Leslie, David E.; McBrearty, Sally; Hartman, Gideon			A Middle Pleistocene intense monsoonal episode from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya: Stable isotopic evidence from bovid teeth and pedogenic carbonates	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Carbon and oxygen isotope values of bovid tooth enamel and pedogenic carbonates were used to reconstruct the paleoenvironments associated with Middle Pleistocene archeological and paleontological sites from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya. Fossil teeth and pedogenic carbonates were collected from lacustrine and fluvial facies (K3 and K3') of the Kapthurin Formation (similar to 543-509 ka). Twenty teeth from six bovid tribes and twenty four pedogenic carbonates were sequentially sampled for stable oxygen and carbon analysis. The primary aims of this work are to reconstruct the vegetative habitats of bovids and environmental landscapes from the Kapthurin Formation, assessing the presence of C-3, C-4, or mixed vegetation and foragers. We also assess general paleoclimate factors, such as overall aridity, seasonal shifts in water availability, and broad habitat reconstructions. Carbon isotope values suggest a wide range of foraging strategies were available to bovids, and are characterized by both C-3 dominated and C-4 dominated diets, with little evidence for mixed feeders, while pedogenic carbonates suggest the landscape combined a mix of C-3 and C-4 vegetation sources, structurally similar to wooded grasslands. Paleoclimatic conditions, based on the reconstructed mean annual water deficit from delta O-18(enamel) values suggest a hyper mesic environment, most comparable to the modern Ituri rainforest, indicating a much wetter climate than the modern Lake Baringo Basin. This environment coincides with an intensified Middle Pleistocene African monsoonal system at the onset of Marine Isotope Stage 13 (similar to 533 ka). The Middle Pleistocene Lake Baringo regional habitat appears to have been one dominated by woodland areas, perennially active streams, marsh and sumpland environments, and a surrounding grassland ecosystem. This lush basin would have provided hominins with a diverse and productive ecosystem. Perhaps not surprisingly, archeological sites are found in all habitats, including wet, forested, and grassland environments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of stand basal area development of thinned and unthinned Acer rubrum forests in the upper Great Lakes region, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Red maple (Acer rubrum L.), historically a common but not abundant tree species in North America, has increased in abundance throughout its range over the last several decades; however, it has received little attention in growth and yield studies. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the effects of stocking level and stand density on overall patterns of red maple stand productivity and (ii) quantify these relationships across a wide range of stand age, site quality, geographic location, and climatic conditions. We used long-term measurements from 52 sites in Wisconsin and Michigan to examine growth responses of even-aged red maple stands to various levels of thinning. Using linear, mixed-effects modeling, future stand-level red maple basal area was modeled as a function of stand and plot characteristics and climatic variables. Growing season precipitation and its interaction with initial red maple basal area were significant predictors; however, they only collectively reduced the mean squared error by 2.1% relative to a base model containing solely stand and plot factors. Model projections indicated there was little difference in predicted future basal area for the range of climate conditions experienced by these stands highlighting red maple's wide tolerance of environmental conditions across the region.

Perch largely preferred fish (36%), insects (54%), other crustaceans (16%) and daphnia (13%). Spatial analysis showed that perch substantially preferred fish in the river section above the dam lakes and insects, crustacean and fish in the river section below the dam lake and in dam lakes. The perch at every size seemed to prefer fish with the highest and lowest percentage obtained for 0 to 80 and 141 to 200 mm. Insects and crustaceans were important for 81 to 140 mm and 0 to 120 mm length, respectively. Crustaceans were important in June, November and July. Insects and fish except for June 2009 constituted an important portion of the diets during every sampling month. The perch showed a piscivory feeding habit, a result obtained by trophic level calculated by stomach contents (3.87) and stable isotope (3.91) methods. Trophic level change little during the ontogeny with relatively higher value obtained for the larger length. The perch inhabiting in the river section above the dam lakes had the highest trophic level compared to the other sites. Diet breadth of perch was lower and higher for larger and middle length (101 to 140 mm), respectively. The diet breadth was higher in dam lakes, indicating opportunistic feeding habits in lakes. Being the most abundant fish species in the study system and showing predatory feeding habits suggested that perch may have an effect on local fish assemblage and itself through predation.

In background of lake utility and its importance at national level such study is essential which is focused on toxic metal pollution and current nutrient status of the lake and their magnification by algae and macrophytes. Study has shown that lake water is rich in nutrients which supports growth of many aquatic macrophytes and algal blooms. Besides, water is contaminated with metals like Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni Pb and Zn. Concentration of some of them like Fe, Pb and Ni were higher than the recommended maximum permissible limits. Concentration of these metals were also found high in lake sediments. The level of metals amongst various components of lake varied considerably in different season. Plants and algae growing therein accumulated appreciable amount of metals and water roots of Salix being more efficient than others. High metal removing potential of these plants may be significant for biomonitoring studies and could be a useful phytoremediation technology to restore water quality by harvesting submerged and floating biomass inhabiting littoral zone of the lake.

BENTHIC NUTRIENT SOURCES TO HYPEREUTROPHIC UPPER KLAMATH LAKE, OREGON, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Three collecting trips were coordinated in April, May, and August 2006 to sample the water column and benthos of hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Lake (OR, USA) through the annual cyanophyte bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. A pore-water profiler was designed and fabricated to obtain the first high-resolution (centimeter-scale) estimates of the vertical concentration gradients of macro- and micronutrients for diffusive-flux determinations. A consistently positive benthic flux for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was observed with solute release from the sediment, ranging between 0.4 and 6.1 mg/m(2)/d. The mass flux over an approximate 200-km(2) lake area was comparable in magnitude to riverine inputs. An additional concern related to fish toxicity was identified when dissolved ammonium also displayed consistently positive benthic fluxes of 4 to 134 mg/m(2)/d, again comparable to riverine inputs. Although phosphorus was a logical initial choice by water quality managers for the limiting nutrient when nitrogen-fixing cyanophytes dominate, initial trace-element results from the lake and major inflowing tributaries suggested that the role of iron limitation on primary productivity should be investigated. Dissolved iron became depleted in the lake water column during the course of the algal bloom, while dissolved ammonium and SRP increased. Elevated macroinvertebrate densities, at least of the order of 104 individuals/m(2), suggested that the diffusive-flux estimates may be significantly enhanced by bioturbation. In addition, heat-flux modeling indicated that groundwater advection of nutrients could also significantly contribute to internal nutrient loading. Accurate environmental assessments of lentic systems and reasonable expectations for point-source management require quantitative consideration of internal solute sources.

So far, it lacks an effective tracer for silicate weathering. Riverine Li isotopes are proposed as a promising tracer as silicate weathering intensity, but the evaporite contribution to riverine Li+ remains poorly constrained, shaking its root as a such tracer. Here, we collected river water samples weekly at the Toudaoguai hydrological station at the end of the upper Yellow River to address this issue. We found that more than 80 % (up to 100 %) of riverine Li+ is sourced from evaporite dissolution within the upper Yellow River catchment, where distributed a large amount of salt lakes and old marine stratum. Even though, the seasonal variation in the riverine Li isotopes still supports that the long residence time in large rivers facilitates the low temperature Li isotopic fractionation and thus temperature dependency. The sources and isotopic variation of terrestrial Li+ input to oceans should therefore be carefully reevaluated.					jin, zhang/JCP-2088-2023; Gou, Long-Fei/T-2301-2017														0921-8181	1872-6364				SEP	2025	252								104862	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2025.104862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2025.104862		MAY 2025											WOS:001489997000001
J	Bhowmik, A; Saha, G				Bhowmik, Awnon; Saha, Goutam			Microplastics in Our Waters: Insights from a Configurative Systematic Review of Water Bodies and Drinking Water Sources	MICROPLASTICS												Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are an emerging global environmental and health concern due to their pervasive presence in aquatic ecosystems. This systematic review synthesizes data on the distribution, shapes, materials, and sizes of MPs in various water sources, including lakes, rivers, seas, tap water, and bottled water, between 2014 and 2024. Results reveal that river water constitutes the largest share of studies on MP pollution (30%), followed by lake water (24%), sea water (19%), bottled water (17%), and tap water (11%), reflecting their critical roles in MP transport and accumulation. Seasonal analysis indicates that MP concentrations peak in the wet season (38%), followed by the dry (32%) and transitional (30%) seasons. Spatially, China leads MP research globally (19%), followed by the USA (7.8%) and India (5.9%). MPs are predominantly composed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with fibers and fragments being the most common shapes. Sub-millimeter MPs (<1 mm) dominate globally, with significant variations driven by anthropogenic activities, industrial discharge, and environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature. The study highlights critical gaps in understanding the long-term ecological and health impacts of MPs, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies, improved waste management, and innovative mitigation strategies. This review underscores the urgency of addressing microplastic pollution through global collaboration and stricter regulatory measures.

J	Müller, KM; Cole, KM; Sheath, RG				Müller, KM; Cole, KM; Sheath, RG			Systematics of Bangia (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) in North America.: II.: Biogeographical trends in karyology:: chromosome numbers and linkage with gene sequence phylogenetic trees	PHYCOLOGIA												An extensive karyological analysis was carried out on marine and freshwater Bangia from North America (70degreesN to c. 23degreesN), including 40 collections from the Pacific, 39 from the Atlantic. 8 from the Laurentian Great Lakes and also 2 freshwater collections from Europe for comparison with the Great Lakes material. Chromosome numbers were determined and linked to gene trees derived from DNA sequence analyses of the chloroplast rbcL and nuclear small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes. For the first time in one continent, five different chromosomal types were observed among marine populations, viz. monosporic plants with three (n), four (n) or six (2n) chromosomes and sexual plants with three (n)/six (2n) or four (n)/eight (2n) chromosomes. These types were also characterized with respect to seasonality and distribution. Freshwater Bangia filaments were all monosporic, with three chromosomes and a distinctive chromosome morphology: the third chromosome is very much smaller than that in marine three-chromosome collections. Based on these observations and DNA sequence analyses in which freshwater collections of Bangia are positioned on a separate and well-supported branch, we propose resurrecting the name B. atropurpurea to represent this lineage. There also appear to be some distinct entities among the marine Bangia occurring along North American coastlines, judging by chromosome numbers and gene trees. For example. there is a transarctic group of monosporic three-chromosome plants that have identical sequences for rbcL and very similar nuclear SSU rRNA gene sequences. However, populations of Bangia along the mid to southern coasts of North America with the same chromosome number were not always found to cluster together in gene trees, suggesting a mixing of multiple species brought about possibly by vector-assisted transport. At this time, marine Populations should continue to be recognized as B. fuscopurpurea until their complex relationships can be resolved.																			0031-8884					MAY	2003	42	3					209	219		10.2216/i0031-8884-42-3-209.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-42-3-209.1													WOS:000183733700001
J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Orbitally forced variation in the size of Ontario Lacus on Titan simulated by a lake balance model	ICARUS												The temporal variation in the size of Ontario Lacus, the largest lake in the southern polar region of Titan, over the past 45 kyr caused by seasonal and orbital forcing is simulated by a lake balance model along with the meteorological input from paleoclimate simulations. Orbital forcing can change the lake volume and lake area by a factor of three to four, mainly due to a long-term variation in precipitation rate. If fast infiltration at the lakebed is assumed to take place, seasonal and secular variation in lake size have similar magnitudes, resulting in a perpetual cycle of drying and flooding of shallow portions of the lake with a period of 30 years. If instead Ontario Lacus is a terminal lake without infiltration, the lake size varies little with season but undergoes larger secular variations. In this case the lake size is strongly out of equilibrium with the instantaneous methane budget of the lake. Orbitally forced flooding of the plain southeast of Ontario Lacus could explain the presence of evaporites. On the other hand, orbital forcing alone cannot cause Ontario Lacus to become as large as the observed possible paleosea since the precipitation in the catchment area does not change by orders of magnitude. Likewise, Ontario Lacus is unlikely to have entirely desiccated over the past 45 kyr.																			0019-1035	1090-2643				JAN 15	2021	354								114090	10.1016/j.icarus.2020.114090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.114090													WOS:000590750400045

Can coppicing planted saplings improve the growing position of mid-tolerant northern hardwood tree species in harvest gaps?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Group harvesting is often used to regenerate mid-tolerant tree species. However, in managed northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes region, regeneration failures are common among mid-tolerant species regardless of gap size. Coppicing advance regeneration has the potential to alter recruitment patterns within harvest gaps, as some mid-tolerant species have large dormant season carbohydrate reserves in the root system. However, the comparative sprouting abilities of northern hardwood saplings are not well quantified. Furthermore, variation in light availability and chronic browsing from white-tailed deer may modify comparative sprouting abilities. In this study, we tracked the effects of dormant season coppicing and deer exclusion on the initial sprouting response and five-year survival, height growth, and final height of seven-year-old volunteer white ash saplings and planted yellow birch, paper birch, northern red oak, sugar maple, red maple, and American beech saplings across a gradient of harvest gap sizes (10-35 m diameter, <0.5-1.25 tree height) in a mature even-aged northern hardwood stand in northern Lower Michigan, USA. In addition, saplings were given a growing position ranking, which integrated sapling final height and survival status relative to competitors to evaluate the effects of coppicing and deer exclusion on sapling development. Overall, coppicing produced a strong initial sprouting response with nearly all red maple and northern red oak stems initially sprouting. In the absence of deer, appreciable differences in sprout survival and height growth occurred among mid-tolerant and intolerant species and contributed to changes in growing position. Northern red oak sprouts significantly gained growing position over all species through a combination of high survival and modest height growth across all gap sizes. In contrast, coppiced yellow birch and paper birch sprout survival was significantly lower than uncoppiced stems, which contributed to declines in growing position for both species across all gap sizes. Coppicing in the absence of deer had less effect on the growing position of mid-tolerant red maple and white ash and shade tolerant sugar maple and American beech. Without deer exclusion, browsing limited the effectiveness of coppicing by reducing height growth and final height of all mid-tolerant species. Collectively, our results indicate that coppicing does not benefit mid-tolerant species equally and is unlikely to benefit browsing-preferred species in areas with high deer density. Nevertheless, in areas of lower deer density or in situations where sprouts can be protected, coppicing may improve the competitiveness of northern red oak saplings within harvest gaps.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				MAR 1	2021	483								118893	10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118893		JAN 2021											WOS:000617947300010

The most predominant fatty acids (SFA) found in pike was palmitic acid (14.78 - 18.13%)(5.38 - 7.99%) and the dominant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, 16.04 - 24.29%), linoleic acids (LA, 2.52 - 4.15%), eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA, 5.05 - 8.33%), and arachidonic acids (AA, 4.34 - 9.78%). The total PUFA content was higher than both total SFA and total MUFA throughout the year. While PUFA content was highest in June when lake water and nutrients are most abundant, SFA and MUFA contents were lowest. By months, the omega-3/omega-6 ratio was 3.65, 0.97, 2.73, 2.76 and 3.48 in November, February, April, June and August, respectively. Fatty acid composition in the muscular tissue of pike and omega-3/omega-6 ratio differed according to month and were particularly affected by spawning.

The hydrological changes, however, are not well investigated due to the limitations in the availability of ground-based observations. In this study, by incorporating satellite-based observations into a hydrological modeling framework, seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of water balance for lakes in the northwest Tibetan Plateau are examined systematically for the period of 1990 to 2022. Satellite-based observations, including lake water area and water level, have been used to calibrate the hydrological model and to estimate lake water storage. The hydrological model performs satisfactorily, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) exceeding 0.5 for all 15 studied lakes. It is found that inflow contributes over 70% of annual water gain for most lakes, while percolation accounts for a larger portion (>60%) of total water loss than evaporation. The studied lakes have expanded substantially, with regional average increasing rates in lake level and water storage of 0.38 m/a and 3.12 x 10(8) m(3)/a, respectively. Some lakes transitioned from shrinking to expanding around 1999, and expansion in most lakes has further accelerated since around 2012, primarily because of increased precipitation over the lake catchments, leading to greater inflow to the lakes. These findings provide important insights into understanding and predicting responses of lake water balance to climate change as well as for developing adaptative strategies.					yan, jiaheng/HOH-5992-2023															2072-4292				MAY 2	2025	17	9							1618	10.3390/rs17091618	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17091618													WOS:001486766200001
J	Dronova, I; Bergen, KM; Ellsworth, DS				Dronova, Iryna; Bergen, Kathleen M.; Ellsworth, David S.			Forest Canopy Properties and Variation in Aboveground Net Primary Production over Upper Great Lakes Landscapes	ECOSYSTEMS												Relationships among aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and forest canopy properties were investigated in secondary successional forests of similar age and disturbance history in northern Lower Michigan, USA. Aboveground biomass, ANPP, canopy leaf area index (LAI), and several canopy nitrogen (N) measures were estimated from 12 stands representing major landform-level ecosystems and vegetation associations. Stand single-date and growing season average normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were derived from Landsat TM. ANPP correlated most strongly with total canopy N content (r (2) = 0.81, P < 0.001), followed by LAI (r (2) = 0.73, P < 0.001) and area-based canopy-average leaf N concentration (r (2) = 0.37, P < 0.05). No significant relationship was detected between ANPP and mass-based canopy-average leaf N concentration. Stand ANPP correlated positively with both total canopy N content (r (2) = 0.62, P < 0.05) and mass-based leaf N concentration (r (2) = 0.53, P < 0.05) of commonly dominant Populus spp. Relatively higher ANPP, total canopy N content and LAI corresponded to simultaneous presence of shade-intolerant P. grandidentata with shade-tolerant species. Both forms of NDVI were significantly related to ANPP, and more strongly to total canopy N content and LAI; relationships were stronger for seasonally averaged (r (2) a parts per thousand yen 0.75, P < 0.001) than for single-date NDVI (r (2) a parts per thousand yen 0.52, P < 0.01). Results indicate that on the transitioning study landscapes, ANPP was more closely related to canopy N content than to LAI, seasonally averaged NDVI was a more reliable predictor of ANPP and canopy properties than the single-date index, whereas measured canopy characteristics varied significantly between major landform-level ecosystems.

J	Wang, L; Cai, QH; Tan, L; Kong, LH				Wang, Lan; Cai, Qing-Hua; Tan, Lu; Kong, Ling-Hui			Longitudinal Differences of Phytoplankton Community during a Period of Small Water Level Fluctuations in a Subtropical Reservoir Bay (Xiangxi Bay, Three Gorges Reservoir, China)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) had a great inflow discharge with small water level fluctuations in the flood season of the year 2008, when a large-scale cyanobacterial bloom broke out in Xiangxi Bay (a tributary bay behaving like a lake) for the first time after the construction of the TGR impoundment. To compare spatiotemporal longitudinal differences of phytoplankton community structure during this period, weekly surveys were performed in Xiangxi Bay. The cyanobacterial bloom lasted from June 6 to July 18, 2008, with Microcystis aeruginosa as the dominant species. During this bloom the species diversity, evenness and community change rate was relatively low. The probable causes for the interruption of the bloom were precipitation and water temperature. In the non-cyanobacterial bloom period (July 25 to September 26, 2008) many other species dominated the community including Stephanodiscus hantzschii and Cryptomonas ovata, with higher values of species diversity, evenness and community change rate. As for the longitudinal differences, the community structure in the riverine zone was different from that in other zones, indicating the important effect of inflow from the upstream of Xiangxi Bay. The management actions in Xiangxi Bay should prevent blooms in the mainstream, lacustrine and transitional zone.

These were sown, along with uninoculated seeds, in 36 field plots arranged in a randomized Latin square. The plots were then sampled regularly over 194 days, and the plants were assayed for the released bacteria and any infectious phages, Both the lysogen and nonlysogen forms of CP6RS survived equally well in situ, contradicting earlier work suggesting lysogens have a competitive disadvantage in nature. A Podoviridae phage, identified as Phi CP6-4, flourished on the nonlysogen-inoculated plants in contrast to those plants inoculated with the lysogen, Conversely, the Siphoviridae phage Phi CP6-1 (used to construct the released lysogen) was isolated abundantly from the lysogen-treated plants but almost never on the nonlysogen-inoculated plants. The uninoculated plants also harbored some Phi CP6-1 phage up to day 137, yet hardly any Phi CP6-4 phages were found, and this was consistent with previous years. We sinew that the different temporal and spatial distributions of these two physiologically distinct phages can bt: explained by application of optimal foraging theory to phage ecology. This is the first time that such in situ evidence has been provided in support of this theoretical model.					bailey, mark/I-7149-2012; Fry, John/H-6081-2012	Ashelford, Kevin/0000-0003-3217-2811; 													0099-2240					OCT	2000	66	10					4193	4199		10.1128/AEM.66.10.4193-4199.2000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.66.10.4193-4199.2000								11010859					WOS:000089649700004

Existing research on water ecological health (WEH) assessment has often overlooked critical aspects such as water resources, water environment, and water ecology, which makes the previous research methods less effective. Therefore, it is essential to explore a new framework for addressing the challenges of WEH assessment in shallow lakes. In this study, Taihu Lake in China between 2011 and 2023 was used as a case study. This paper first constructed a new framework based on water resource-environment-ecology (WREE), which includes seven key indices, and the reasons for this change were explored. Additionally, the eutrophication assessment and the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) evaluation method were employed to assess the effectiveness of this new approach framework. The results show that the water quality in Taihu Lake improved to a certain extent from 2011 - 2023, whereas eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms have not significantly improved, and WEH has been classified into the medium state (level III). In particular, the WEH values were relatively low in 2013 and 2017, and showed a fluctuating downward trend from 2020 to 2023, which may be attributed to meteorological factors and human activities leading to an increase in pollution-tolerant species and a decrease in biodiversity, ultimately resulting in a deterioration of WEH. The long-term WEH assessment results for Taihu Lake highlight the applicability of the framework based on the WREE, and can be widely applied to similar lake ecosystems but are not applicable to short-term seasonal variations. Given the impacts of increased human activities and climate change, the WREE framework provides valuable insights for the sustainable development and effective management of lake ecosystems, while also enhancing the existing WEH assessment theory.

A subtropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest surrounding the lake is inferred from the pollen data. The composition of the green algae community indicates a clear, shallow (about 5-6 m deep), mesotrophic freshwater lake. The inferred pH was about 7.0-8.0 during the algae growing season. Applying the Coexistence Approach, the climatic conditions in Early Pliocene Du'ao were: (1) mean annual temperature ranged from 18.1 to 22.0A degrees C, (2) difference in temperature between the coldest and warmest months ranged from 14.2 to 15.1A degrees C, (3) mean temperature of the coldest month varied from 10.7 to 12.1A degrees C, (4) mean temperature of the warmest month ranged from 23.5 to 25.4A degrees C, (5) mean annual precipitation varied from about 994 to 1,255 mm, (6) minimum monthly precipitation ranged from about 9 to 11 mm, and (7) maximum monthly precipitation varied from approximately 219 to 245 mm. These values indicate that the Early Pliocene climate was subtropical.					li, jinfeng/GVS-5425-2022														0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2010	43	4					751	769		10.1007/s10933-009-9366-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-009-9366-z													WOS:000276481300009
J	Mangili, C; Plessen, B; Wolff, C; Brauer, A				Mangili, Clara; Plessen, Birgit; Wolff, Christian; Brauer, Achim			Climatic implications of annual to decadal resolution stable isotope data from calcite varves of the Pianico interglacial lake record, Southern Alps	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Stable oxygen isotope analyses at annual, 2-, 5-, 10- and 20-varve sample resolutions were carried out on two selected varve intervals from the interglacial sediment record of the Pianico palaeolake. These sediments are particularly suitable for ultra-high-resolution isotope analyses on lacustrine endogenic calcite because of the exceptionally well-preserved varve structure. A bias through detrital contamination can be excluded because microscopically controlled sampling enabled selecting detritus-free samples. The studied sediment intervals comprise 352 and 88 continuous varve series formed during periods of rapid climate change at the onset and end of a marked millennial-scale cool interval during the Pianico Interglacial. The most intriguing result is a pronounced short-term oscillation in the bi-annually resolved isotope record superimposed on the general decreasing and increasing delta(18)O trends at the climatic transitions that is recorded at lower sample resolution. Spectral analyses of the bi-annual time series reveal periodicities indicating solar and NAO controls on the delta(18)O record. Multiple delta(18)O measurements from endogenic calcite of individual varies showed variations of up to 0.6 parts per thousand, thus larger than the observed inter-annual variability and most likely explained by seasonal effects.

Samples were collected monthly from 4 stations which were chosen in the west part of the lake. At each station, water samples were obtained at three site. The first sites were at the closest point to the shore. In addition, there is 100 m distance between each sites. In total 54 phytoplankton species were recorded: Bacillariophyta 30, Chlorophyta 12, Cyanophyta 5, Euglenophyta 3, Dinophyta 2, Chrysophya 1 and Cryptophyta 1. Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta constituted majority of the phytoplankton both in terms of species numbers and density. No apparent differences were found in phytoplankton compositon at three sampling sites of each station. In general, surface phytoplankton were found to be rather poor as it was in the previous quantative phytoplankton studies carried-out in the lake. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured higher (8.39-21.79 mg/m(3)) than the previous studies.

J	Gaiser, EE; Johansen, J				Gaiser, EE; Johansen, J			Freshwater diatoms from Carolina bays and other isolated wetlands on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA, with descriptions of seven taxa new to science	DIATOM RESEARCH												This study represents the first taxonomic and ecological description of the diatom flora of Carolina bays, the most abundant, natural lentic systems on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. Diatoms were collected from surface sediments and benthic and planktonic microhabitats in Carolina bays and other isolated wetland ponds in South Carolina during three seasons to survey the extant flora and document habitat affinities. The ponds ranged from marshes and grass/sedge meadows to forested swamps and were prone to episodic drying. All were acidic, dystrophic and nutrient-poor. At the generic level, diatom assemblages resembled those of other acidic, shallow ponds, being dominated by Eunotia, Pinnularia, Frustulia and Neidium. Diatom assemblages were distinct from neighboring lotic and reservoir systems, and contained several taxa new to science. Considerable variation in diatom assemblage composition among ponds was attributable, in part, to differences in susceptibility of the ponds to drying. In basins that dry frequently, aerophilic taxa such as Orthoseira dendroteres (Ehrenberg) Crawford, Pinnularia borealis var. scalaris (Ehrenberg) Rabhenhorst and Luticola saxophila (Bock ex Hustedt) Mann were common. Permanent pond assemblages were dominated by species of Frustulia, Tabellaria and Stenopterobia. Habitat fidelity was low; most taxa were associated with a diversity of substrates and did not exhibit marked seasonality. Substrate and seasonal associations are given for taxa with notable affinities. Taxonomic descriptions are provided for Eunotia pocosinensis sp. nov., Eunotia sarraceniae sp. nov., Stauroneis anceps var. subrostrata var, nov., Pinnularia turfosiphila sp. nov., Pinnularia bigibba sp. nov., Pinnularia subgibba var. gracilis var. nov. and Pinnularia subgibba var. lanceolata var. nov.					; Johansen, Jeffrey/F-5616-2011; Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020	Gaiser, Evelyn/0000-0003-2065-4821; Johansen, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0794-9417; 													0269-249X					MAY	2000	15	1					75	130																WOS:000088756800006

Flowering stems were censused weekly for 54 weeks in six sites that had been burned one to six times in the previous 16 years. We concurrently measured overstory characteristics such as species composition, density and basal area. We used maximum likelihood and Akaike's Information Criterion to compare linear, quadratic, saturating, and null models of community response to repeating burning. We did not find a relationship between species richness, diversity or flowering stem density and fire frequency. Tree density was related to fire frequency and may represent an indirect pathway for fire effects on understory characteristics. While we found no support for the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, an analysis of our experimental design indicated that we had low statistical power. We develop the hypothesis that a saturating model of response to fire best describes understory species richness in our system. We test this hypothesis using the most extensive published fire data set we are aware of and find support for a saturating model.																			1100-9233					FEB	2000	11	1					113	122		10.2307/3236782	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3236782													WOS:000086042400015
J	McMahon, RF				McMahon, RF			The physiological ecology of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in North America and Europe	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST					Symposium on the Biology, Ecology, and Physiology of Zebra Mussels, at the American-Society-of-Zoologists Annual Meeting	JAN 05, 1995	ST LOUIS, MO	Amer Soc Zoologists				The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), was introduced into North America in 1986. Initial North American (N.A.) studies suggested that physiological responses varied between N.A. and European populations. However, literature review indicates agreement on most aspects of physiological adaptation including: respiratory responses; hypoxia/anoxia tolerance; salinity limits; emersion tolerance; freezing resistance; environmental pH limits; calcium limits; starvation responses; and bioenergetic partitioning. The main differences among N.A. and European mussels appear to be elevated upper thermal limits and temperatures for optimum growth among N.A. populations. N.A. zebra mussels probably originated from the northern shore of the Black Sea in the warmest portion of the mussel's European range. However, most European physiological data come from northern Europe where populations may be adapted to colder temperatures. Alternatively, N.A. research suggests that mussels may have a capacity for seasonal temperature acclimatization such that responses recorded in wanner N.A. waters may be different from those recorded in northern Europe even after short-term laboratory acclimation. Studies of genetic variation and physiological response among European and N.A. D. polymorpha populations are required to elucidate the basis for physiological differentiation. Recently evolved D. polymorpha has poor resistance adaptations compared to unionacean and sphaeriid bivalves with longer freshwater fossil histories. Poor resistance adaptations make it less suited for stable habitats, instead, its high fecundities, early maturity, and rapid growth are adaptations to unstable habitats where extensive resistance adaptations are of little value.																			0003-1569					JUN	1996	36	3					339	363																WOS:A1996VC20700010

Using the annual proportional flow deviation as a measure of river regulation, the Paroo River catchment was assessed as unregulated, the Darling River catchment as mildly regulated and the Murrumbidgee River and River Murray catchments as highly regulated. A total of 11 010 fish, representing nine native and three alien species, was caught during high and low flow seasons in the four catchments. Native species, such as golden perch Macquaria ambigua (Percichthyidae), bony herring Nematalosa erebi (Clupeidae) and spangled perch Leiopotherapon unicolor (Teraponidae), dominated fish communities in the Paroo and Darling catchments, but alien species, mostly carp, Cyprinus carpio (Cyprinidae), were also abundant. Both native and alien species were more abundant in these catchments after flooding, but there was little change in species composition between high and low flow seasons at the catchment level. Carp dominated communities in the Murray and Murrumbidgee catchments. There was a significant trend for reduced species diversity in increasingly regulated catchments. River regulation may alter the relative abundance of native and alien fish by desynchronizing environmental cycles and the reproductive cycles of native species. Ordination of species abundances showed discrete fish communities that reflect the geographical separation between catchments. Differences between communities are related to opportunities for dispersal, the environmental tolerances of dominant species and the modifying effects of river regulation. Fish communities in lakes exhibited less seasonal variation than riverine communities within the same catchment, indicating the greater seasonal stability of lakes compared with regulated and unregulated river reaches. Management of fish resources needs to include catchment-specific strategies within current State and basin-wide management programmes.

Remote sensing technology, with its wide coverage, continuous monitoring capability, and cost-efficiency, overcomes the limitations of traditional methods, which are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and spatially restricted. As a result, it has become an effective tool for monitoring organic pollution in water environments. In this study, we propose a physically constrained remote sensing algorithm for the quantitative estimation of organic pollution in inland waters based on radiative transfer theory. The algorithm was applied to the Feilaixia Basin using Sentinel-2 data. Accuracy assessment results demonstrate good performance in the quantitative assessment of organic pollution, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.79, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.03%, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.39 mg/L. Additionally, a seasonal variation map of organic pollutant concentrations in the Feilaixia Basin was generated, providing valuable scientific support for regional water quality monitoring and management.

Sampling was conducted every 2 weeks from February 2002 to February 2004 at a pelagic station in Lake Tanganyika off Kigoma (Tanzania). Changes in algal community structure were observed: the reported cyanobacteria-chrysophytes-chlorophytes community of 1975 was replaced by a cyanobacteria-chlorophytes-diatom community. Moreover differences in species composition were detected between 1975 and 2002-2003. Besides the rarity of chrysophytes not all the species reported from 1975 were observed and conversely new taxa were found. While taxonomic issues make a direct comparison difficult, our data provide evidence for real floristic changes. These changes may be related to the decreasing productivity of the lake, as was recently reported for Lake Tanganyika and confirmed in the present study.

J	Faithful, J; Finlayson, W				Faithful, J; Finlayson, W			Water quality assessment for sustainable agriculture in the Wet Tropics - A community-assisted approach	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					Conference for Reef Research	MAR, 2004	Townsville, AUSTRALIA					A number of studies in north Queensland over the past two decades have concluded that large amounts of nutrients and sediments are exported from agricultural watersheds, particularly during wet season rainfall events. With the co-operation of a number of growers, runoff from Queensland Wet Tropics banana and cane farm paddocks in two distinct tropical river catchments was examined to provide an estimate of nutrient and sediment concentrations and export, with comparison to water quality of flow through a small urban lakes system. Median total nitrogen concentrations in cane drainage runoff (3110 mu g N/L) were higher than for banana paddock drainage (2580 mu gN/L), although the maximum concentration was recorded from a banana paddock (20,900 mu g N/L). Nitrogen losses during post-event drainage flow were supplemented by high proportions of NOx (nitrate + nitrite) sourced from groundwater inputs. Banana paddocks had the highest maximum and median total phosphorus and TSS concentrations (5120 and 286 mu gP/L, and 7250 and 75 mg/L respectively) compared to the cane farms (1430 and 50 mu gP/L, and 1840 and 14 mg/L respectively). The higher phosphorus and TSS concentrations in the banana runoff were attributed to higher paddock slopes and a greater proportion of exposed ground surface during the wet season. Highest nutrient and TSS concentrations corresponded with samples collected near the peak discharge periods; however, the rising stage of the drainage flows, where the highest nutrient and TSS concentrations are often reported, were difficult to target because of the manual sampling strategy used. This study shows that high concentrations of nutrients and TSS occur in the runoff from cane and banana paddocks. Median total nitrogen, total phosphorus and TSS concentrations in flow through the urban lakes were 369 mu g N/L, 16 mu g P/L and I I mg/L, respectively. Flux estimates of 9.2 kgN, 0.8 kgP and 126 kgTSS/ha were determined for drainage runoff from a banana paddock during a single intensive storm event. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Prevalence, mean abundance, mean intensity, numbers of gravid females, relative abundance of the different fish species, relative output of eggs and relative flow rates for each host species were computed. Acanthocephalus tumescens showed low host specificity, successfully parasitizing six out of eight fish species present in the lake. No paratenic infection was registered. If prevalence, mean abundance, and number of gravid females are considered, host species can be placed in a continuum from the most to least suitable as follows: Galaxias platei Steindachner, Diplomystes viedmensis (Mac Donagh), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill), Percichthys trucha (Cuvier et Valenciennes) and Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns). However, when parasite flow rates and egg output were calculated, including relative abundance of each fish species, the continuum was rearranged as follows: P. trucha, O. mykiss, G. platei/G. maculatus, S. fontinalis and D. viedmensis.

J	Liang, SJ; Liu, JC; Bao, MJ; Fan, YF; Kong, M				Liang, Sijia; Liu, Jianchao; Bao, Meijun; Fan, Yifan; Kong, Ming			Microplastics in lakes: Distribution patterns and influencing factors	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												As a kind of new pollutants, microplastics (MPs) have aroused public concern due to their widespread presence and potential ecological risks. Lakes, as crucial freshwater ecosystems and important water resources, are particularly vulnerable to MPs pollution. While MPs are known to be unevenly distributed within lakes, their distribution patterns and influencing factors have not been thoroughly understood. This review analyzes 84 field studies across 64 lakes worldwide to elucidate MPs distribution patterns and their driving mechanisms. Analysis reveals that MPs abundance is typically highest near areas of intense human activity and major water inflows, though hydrodynamics and wind conditions also influence spatial patterns. MPs characteristics (shape, size, color, polymer type) show distinct distribution patterns influenced by source types, transport mechanisms, and degradation processes. While surface water MPs concentrations vary seasonally due to precipitation, wind, and human activities, sediment cores indicate increasing MPs abundance in recent deposits. Integration of water and sediment sampling reveals that MPs characteristics affect their vertical distribution, with denser particles prone to sedimentation. This review identifies key knowledge gaps, including limited data on vertical distributions and temporal variations, and emphasizes the need for standardized methods and quantitative analysis of driving factors. These reviewed findings provide a foundation for understanding MPs fate in lake ecosystems and improving risk assessment capabilities, offering valuable insights for future surveys on MPs.

Our research aimed to identify selfish polysaccharide utilization by bacteria in freshwater ecosystems by examining spatial and seasonal variations in two lakes. The results of our fluorescently labeled substrate incubations revealed selfish activity in both lakes, with a larger proportion of the community showing selfish uptake of pullulan. The mesotrophic lake showed greater microbial diversity and ability for selfish uptake, particularly during a phytoplankton bloom. On the other hand, the oligotrophic lake had higher selfish activity during periods of increased terrestrial influence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining combined with microbial diversity analysis revealed the selfish activity of phyla Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota as well as class Gammaproteobacteria, with different genera active depending on lake, season, and substrate. This research provides a basis for future interpretation of nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems.

J	Alford, JB				Alford, J. Brian			Multi-scale assessment of habitats and stressors influencing stream fish assemblages in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study determined if a spatial hierarchy existed with respect to reach-scale habitat, subwatershed-scale, and watershed-scale geomorphology and land use stressors on fish assemblages in southeastern U.S. coastal plain streams. During May-October 2009-2012, fishes were sampled by seine, and habitat was assessed at 50 reaches in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin (USA). Using partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) a variance decomposition procedure was used to partial out influences of confounding covariables at each spatial scale. Reach-scale habitat had the strongest association with the assemblage. Stream width, depth, aquatic vegetation and human debris cover, rapid habitat assessment score, and large woody debris volume were the most important variables. At subwatershed and watershed scales, natural and anthropogenic characteristics were important, including elevation, gradient, watershed area, wetland cover, stream density, road, dam and oil/gas well densities. Six species were associated most strongly with the watershed variables, compared to reach- and subwatershed-scale variables. These species had more "r-selected" life-history strategies (e.g., smaller eggs, shorter life spans, multiple broods, longer spawning season, and trophic generalists). In contrast, most species that were associated strongest with reach-scale variables exhibited more "k-selected" life-history traits (e.g., larger eggs, longer life spans, shorter spawning season, single brood, and trophic specialists).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2014	738	1					129	146		10.1007/s10750-014-1925-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1925-2													WOS:000340479400010

Behavior of Dioxin Like PCBs and PBDEs During Early Diagenesis of Organic Matter in Settling Material and Bottom Sediments from the Sewage Impacted Buenos Aires' Coastal Area, Argentina	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Settling particles (SPs) and sediments collected in the Buenos Aires sewer area were analyzed for dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (dlPCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) to follow early diagenetic changes during transport and deposition of organic matter. SP showed a temporal trend of higher total organic carbon (TOC) and fresher dlPCBs and PBDEs signatures during warm-rainy months related to more efficient washout of residues. TOC-normalized sediment trap concentrations suggest a diagenetic magnification of dlPCBs during cold-dry months due to enhanced decomposition of TOC, whereas most labile PBDEs appear to follow TOC decay. The diagenetic behavior of individual congeners along seasonal changes (cold/warm) and during deposition (bottom sediment/SP) shows the selective preservation of heavier, more persistent congeners with a positive relationship with sediment half-lives. The 3-4 times diagenetic magnification of heavier congeners observed in bottom sediments would be a prevailing long-term pathway for dlPCBs and PBDEs bioaccumulation in detritus feeding organisms.

Through field measurements and laboratory experiments, spatial distribution characteristics of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) contents were revealed, and the release rate-flow disturbance curve in sediment of the Inner Lake was formed. The mathematical models of the migration and transformation of Cd were built and calibrated. With the models, the fluctuation characteristics of Cd pollution load were quantitatively assessed in different time scales, as in typical years (1998, 2001, and 2004) and in typical tidal cycles of dry seasons and flood seasons. The results showed that: there was a positive correlation between the release rate of Cd and flow disturbance intensity. Influenced by the hydrologic regime of the Yangtze River, the Cd pollution load was higher in high-water years than that in common-water years and low-water years, and was higher in flood seasons than that in dry seasons. Influenced by the tide of the Yangtze River, the Cd pollution load increased during ebb tide and reduced during the rising tide.																			1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2014	42	10					1402	1408		10.1002/clen.201300693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201300693													WOS:000343834300010

The number or total area of nursery places hardly limited the recruitment of vendace in the study lakes. The major proportion of prerecruit mortality of vendace occurred in the larval phase and larval sampling produced significant information on young-of-the-year survival.

Seasonal potential of Pistia stratiotes in nutrient removal to eliminate eutrophication in Al-Sero Drain (South Nile Delta, Egypt)	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The present study was conducted to investigate the potential of the free-floating macrophytes Pistia stratiotes to remediate nutrients and restore the eutrophic drain (Al-Sero Drain), South Nile Delta, Egypt. Plant and water samples were collected monthly for ten months using three randomly distributed quadrats in each of three sites. Monthly significant variation in all investigated water nutrients was recorded. The plant biomass showed bell-shaped distribution, with the lowest shoot and root biomass during May, while their peaks were during September. The plant shoots accumulated higher concentrations of most nutrient elements, except Mg, than the roots. The order of nutrients concentration (%) in P. stratiotes shoot was K > N > Ca > Na > Mg > P, while in the root was K > N > Na > Ca > Mg > P. Most nutrients standing stock (g/m(-2)) had the same biomass trend with the minimum during May and the maximum during August-October, which is the potential period for mowing the plant to remediate the highest nutrients and restore the eutrophic watercourses. Most investigated nutrients (except Ca) content in water were significantly correlated to their concentration in the different plant organs, which in turn provide a quantitative assessment of the environmental quality that suggests the potential use of this plant as a biomonitor of nutrient elements in eutrophic watercourses.

Forst	JOURNAL OF BERRY RESEARCH												BACKGROUND: The Berberis microphylla (calafate) is an evergreen shrub considered a non-timber product from the Patagonian forest, relevant for the diversification of agrifood production, particularly interesting since its black-blue fruits are extremely rich in phenolic compounds. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives were to: (1) quantify the variability of fruit traits, anthocyanin content, efficiency of the reproductive shoots and leaf nutrient content within the set of 34 B. microphylla wild accessions from Tierra del Fuego Island, Argentina, (2) calculate the coefficients of correlation between variables and (3) detect relationships between the genotypes. METHODS: Plants growing near Ushuaia city (n = 12), bordering Fagnano lake (n = 12) and central area of the Tierra del Fuego Island (n = 10) were selected. RESULTS: A significant variability in fruit traits, anthocyanin content and the efficiency of reproductive shoots among and within the three populations was assessed, a result with great relevance for breeding purposes. Phenotypic plasticity was related with the environmental conditions, i.e. air temperatures for each population during the three monitored growing seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results indicate that yearly environmental factors play a relevant role in phenotypic variation of both individual plants and populations, thus confirming the complexity of wild species evolution and domestication processes.

We investigated the breeding season habitat preference and foraging site fidelity of the under-studied and threatened, Baltic Sea population of Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia). Using GPS devices, we tracked 20 adult individuals at two breeding colonies, in Sweden and Finland, from late incubation through chick-rearing. Analyzing foraging movements during this period, we describe trip characteristics for each colony, daily metrics of effort, habitat use, and foraging site fidelity. We found that daily time spent away from the colony increased throughout the season, with colony-level differences in terms of distance travelled per day. In general, terns selected shallow waters between 0-5 meters in depth with certain individuals using inland lakes for foraging. We show, for the first time, that individual Caspian Terns are faithful to foraging sites throughout the breeding season, and that individuals are highly repeatable in their strategies regarding foraging site fidelity. These results fill important knowledge gaps for this at-risk population, and extend our general knowledge of the breeding season foraging ecology of this widespread species.

In order to study this impact on specific areas, the present study identified the spatiotemporal variation of erosive rainfall and the influence of its variation on streamflow and sediment discharge within the Ganjiang River Basin. Daily average rainfall data were obtained from 23 national meteorological observation stations along with streamflow and sediment concentration data collected for 1964-2013 at 6 control stations. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall method and Pettitt test were used for trend analysis and changepoint detection, and the modified double mass curve method was used to quantify the effects of both erosive rainfall variation and human activities on hydrological regime shifts. Results showed significant monthly variation in erosive rainfall and significant increases in rainstorms over the entire watershed, particularly in the downstream subzone and northeast corner of the upstream subzone. While moderate rain showed an insignificant decrease in both subzones and the entire watershed, heavy rain showed no significant variation over the entire watershed but did show a significant increase in both the midstream and downstream subzones. The changes in accumulative erosive rainfall had only small effects on reduction in sediment discharge after the changepoint year. In contrast, human activities contributed to more than 50% of the changes in sediment discharge in the entire basin. These findings provide a research basis for the study of extreme climate, flood disaster prevention, and soil erosion prediction over the entire watershed.																			0936-577X	1616-1572					2021	85						51	67		10.3354/cr01667	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01667													WOS:000751732200004

PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN A EUTROPHIC AND HIGH-ALKALINITY LAKE IN THE COLD REGIONS OF NORTHERN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The investigation of phytoplankton was carried out from May to October month by month in 2018 in Hulun Lake, north China. Our purpose is to explore the community structure characteristics of phytoplankton by using the method of functional groups, combined with the monitoring results of water environmental factors, discussed the correlation between them in this special lake with high alkalinity, turbidity and eutrophication, so as to further explore the mechanisms of cyanobacteria bloom. Altogether 21 functional groups were identified, including 7 predominant functional groups. The predominant functional groups demonstrated strong spatio-temporal variations. It should also be noted that group H1 and M were the main culprits for the cyanobacteria bloom in the lake. Redundancy and Pearson analysis revealed that WT, DO, TP and TN were the most significant environmental factors controlling the distribution of phytoplankton functional groups. Furthermore, this study also evaluated the water quality in Hulun Lake by using Q index which shows it in a "medium" state. In a word, our results evidenced that a timely water environment dynamic can be reflected by monitoring the phytoplankton in Hulun Lake, which is also a superb way for the real-time monitoring of cyanobacteria bloom in this area.					xingchun, Li/HMD-2892-2023														1589-1623	1785-0037					2021	19	3					1549	1569		10.15666/aeer/1903_15491569	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1903_15491569													WOS:000656877100001

Multi-task Convolution Neural Network for Season-Insensitive Chlorophyll-A Estimation in Inland Water	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, a crucial indicator of phytoplankton biomass, is sensitive to seasonality. The variations in trophic states regarding seasonality and the changes of spectral properties of water bodies pose uncertainties to the accuracy of remote sensing semiempirical models. In particular, lakes in subtropical regions generally experience different trophic states in dry and wet seasons. In this study, a season-insensitive Chl-a retrieval model using multitask convolution neural network with multiple output layers (MCNN) is proposed. A layer-sharing network combined with data augmentation is adopted to alleviate the issue of insufficient quantity of in situ samples. In addition, a hyperparameter optimization is performed to automatically refine the MCNN architecture. To evaluate the accuracy of proposed method, Laguna Lake, one of the largest lakes in Southeast Asia, is selected as the validation target. The lake is characterized by oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in wet season, whereas the states change to mesotrophic and low-level eutrophic states in dry season. A collection of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument Level-2 images and 409 in situ samples with the Chl-a concentration range 1.24-22.30 mg center dot m(-3) were used for model calibration and evaluation. Experimental results showed that MCNN with the performance of average R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 2.06 mg center dot m(-3), Pearson's r = 0.86 outperforms related semiempirical models, including normalized difference chlorophyll index, two-band and three-band models, and WaterNet.

The region is highly dependent on reservoirs for human water supply, irrigation, industry, and livestock. The objective of this study was to validate water level time series from the satellites Envisat, SARAL, Sentinel-3A/-3B, Jason-2/-3 in small reservoirs in Northeast Brazil. In total, we evaluated the water level time series of 20 reservoirs. The Sentinel-3B outperforms the other altimeters with a maximum RMSE of 0.21 m. In seven reservoirs with updated depth-area-volume curves, the altimetric water level was used to calculate the corresponding volume. The obtained volume was then compared to the volume given by the same curve by using in situ stage. Our investigations showed that, in the case of small reservoirs, the precision of water level time series derived from satellite altimetry is mainly governed by the seasonal variability of the water storage especially at the end of the 2012-2017 drought period.

This research was made to assess the trophic and ecological status of Lake Bafa in Turkey, on the basis of phytoplankton communities. Buyuk Menderes River is one of the most important factor that carries pollutants to Lake Bafa. The eight sampling station were assigned to evaluate the ecological and trophic state of the lake. Phytoplankton species were collected monthly for 2 years study period. Most commonly used phtoplankton indices Q index and Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI), and different versions of diversity indices were used to estimate trophic and ecological state of the lake. Similarities between the sampling stations were clustured by using the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA), based on phytoplankton communities. Correlations between the applied indices were determined by using Pearson Correlation. After the identification of collected phytoplanktons, total of 63 taxa which belong to classis of Cyanophyceae (11.2%), Bacillariophyceae (49.2%), Chlorophyceae (23.8%), Xanthophyceae (1.5%), Euglenophyceae (11.2%) and Dinophyceae (3.1%) were detected. The 1st and 2nd stations were the most similar stations to each other (88%) according to phytoplankton communities. Secchi disc depth (SD) and TP played an important role in the distribution of phytoplankton species in Lake Bafa. The highest significant positive correlation was determined between Q and TSI (r = 0.987, p<0.01). Considering the TDI values in the phytoplankton composition of the lake, it can be said that although the productivity status of the studied lake is still "mesotrophic", it has a tendency towards "eutrophic" state. According to the Q values, the first five stations reflect the moderate ecological state, while the 6th, 7th and 8th stations represent the poor ecological state.					; Akgul, Riza/MBH-0772-2025; ERTAŞ, Alperen/AAC-6271-2021; Tuney, Inci/GLR-3086-2022	ERTAS, Alperen/0000-0001-8510-6100; Tuney, Inci/0000-0003-0293-6964; AKGUL, Riza/0000-0002-0280-2897													1300-1590	2148-3140					2021	38	2					135	146		10.12714/egejfas.38.2.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.12714/egejfas.38.2.01													WOS:000745059200001

This study presents an overview of the recent eutrophication status in Hanoi lakes and compares the lakes with Cu Chinh Lake based on a case study performed from April 2017 to March 2018. The eutrophication was mainly assessed by comparing the nutritional parameters (phosphorus and nitrogen) with values of poor nutrition and the concentration of algal biomass with concentrations found in hypereutrophic lakes. In addition, we investigated which nutrients contribute to limiting the growth of algae based on the total nitrogen/total phosphorus ratio, and we identified groups of algae that contained typical species in Cu Chinh Lake. The nutrient levels and algal biomass in many lakes were maintained between the eutrophic and hypereutrophic limits and underwent seasonal changes throughout the year. In Cu Chinh Lake, phosphorus is the predominant limiting nutrient for the development of algae. Thus, some typical algae genera, such as Microcystis, Anabaena of cyanobacteria, and Scenedesmus of green algae, are biological indicators of eutrophication in the lake.

Assessment of the impact of seepage waters in landfills for solid waste and activated sludge on the water quality of small rivers in the humid zone	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Based on seasonal studies of chemical compound of drainage waters of landfill site, active sludge dump and small rivers (Neluksa and Sel'gskaya) draining their territory, the chemical markers of the waste dump impact were established. Water and chemical balance of waste dumps is established and the volumes of different chemical components discharge with drainage waters and rivers into the Lake Onego are calculated. River heads were not contaminated and were considered as a background stations. Drain waters of active sludge dump strongly contaminate the Sel'gskaya river water downstream their inlet point. Contamination was established by the following chemical variables: mineral composition (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-), organic matter (BOD5, Color, CODCr, CODMn, TOC), nutrients (P-tot., P-min., NH4+, NO2-, N-tot., N-org.), gases (CO2, O-2), heavy metals (Mn, Cr, Co, Zn, Ni, Cu), conductivity, suspended matter, pH, phenols, and synthetic surfactants. These components were considered as markers of active sludge impact. Active sludge dump makes up 20% of suspended matter, 17% of labile organics (BOD5), 14% NO2-, 3.2% N-org., and 10% N-tot. of the total river discharge. All volume of NH4+ discharge in the lake is supplied by active sludge dump. The sound influence was also observed for CODCr (2.5%), CODMn (2.0%), Cu (4.5%), Zn (2.7%), TDS (3.5%), Cl- (2.7%) and Na+ (2.5%). Drain waters of landfill site affected the Neluksa River in a much lesser degree, differences in chemical composition downstream the drainage waters inlet were established for Na+, Cl-, pH, HCO3-, CO2, NO3-, total Fe, Mn, which can be considered as markers of landfill site impact. The share of landfill site in NH4+ discharge is 12%, N-tot - 2.0%, Cl- - 2.5%, and Na+ - 1.2%. Total petroleum hydrocarbons contamination in the region has diffusive character and mainly originates from precipitation.

J	Barker, PA; Pates, JM; Payne, RJ; Healey, RM				Barker, PA; Pates, JM; Payne, RJ; Healey, RM			Changing nutrient levels in grasmere, English lake district, during recent centuries	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Historical nutrient changes in Grasmere were investigated using a 300-year record derived from six sediment cores. One core was investigated at high resolution for diatoms, total sedimentary phosphorus, and loss-on-ignition (LOI), and was dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137. Six other cores were scanned for magnetic susceptibility, diatoms and LOI to confirm the stratigraphic integrity of the primary record. 2. A rise in nutrient levels occurred after 1855 AD. This event was marked by a shift away from benthic diatom assemblages and a rise in Asterionella formosa. The onset of eutrophication from 1855 corresponds to the expansion of the local and tourist population in the area. 3. The replacement of A. formosa with Cyclotella spp. ca 1945-65 indicates reduced nutrient loads, possibly because of enhanced flushing brought about by the seasonal rainfall distribution. 4. After 1965 a step-wise increase in both absolute and relative amounts of Asterionella was found. High sedimentary P and diatom inferred TP confirmed the high nutrient loading of the lake. Nutrient increase is attributable to problems with the Grasmere village sewage system and the installation of a wastewater treatment works (WwTW) on the River Rothay in 1971. Modifications to the WwTW in 1982 caused an initial improvement, but have not led to a full recovery to pre-1965 ecological conditions. 5. The diatom record indicates a further improvement after 1990 by a return toward Achnanthes minutissima. 6. The sedimentary archive of sensitive sites provides important benchmarks against which to judge the attainment of water quality targets.

The sampling strategy was designed to be representative of the physico-chemical gradients of the water column of the lake, and of the seasonal variability as well, i.e. 12 different depths sampled in triplicates from April to December 2005. In the space, viral lytic activity estimated from the frequency of visibly infected prokaryotic cells and from burst size over the study period generally decreased with depth. This was viewed as a paradox compared to the abundances of viruses and prokaryotes and to the prokaryotic production which increased with depth. The seasonal variability in viral lytic activity was correlated with prokaryotic variables (abundance and production) in the deepest waters, i.e. from the hypolimnion downwards. Compared to previous studies known from the mixolimnion, we conclude that the deep waters in Lake Pavin represent an exclusive environment for heterotrophic prokaryotes whose seasonal activity offers an optimal and unique resource for thriving viral communities, some of which may be typical, endemic to the ambient dark, cold and stable deep water masses. Overall, the main findings in the present study get well around a previous statement that the ecology of the deepest waters of Lake Pavin is essentially driven by the dark viral loop (dissolved organic matter-prokaryotes-viruses) processes, which can sequester organic matters and nutrients for a long-lived turnover time. This is in agreement with recent demonstrations from marine systems that meso- and bathypelagic waters are optimal environments for viral survival and proliferation.

J	Ferreira, LV				Ferreira, LV			Effects of flooding duration on species richness, floristic composition and forest structure in river margin habitat in Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests: implications for future design of protected areas	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Rivers in central Amazonia experience annual water-level fluctuations of up to 14 m, flooding vast areas of adjacent forest for periods ranging from a few to 270 days per year. At different sites, variation in the duration and type of flooding results in a mosaic of habitats that includes lakes, grasslands, forests, and streams. To study the effects of flood duration on plant species richness and floristic composition, two river margin sites were surveyed on the rivers Jau and Taruma-Mirim. Both areas are seasonally flooded by blackwaters, and plots were made at different topographic levels (lower, middle and upper slopes). All woody plants with DBH > 5cm were inventoried in five 10 x 40 m plots in each of the three topographic levels, which varied in length of flood duration and mean water level. Plant species richness did not vary significantly between topographic levels, but species composition varied substantially. At both study sites, the species composition exhibited distinctive distribution patterns with respect to the three topographic levels and river site. Differences in the distribution of dominant species in both sites probably relate to the ability of species to withstand seasonal flooding, although other edaphic factors associated with the topographic levels may also be important, especially for less-dominant, locally rare, and habitat generalist species. Species composition overlap among topographic levels at the two sites was highly variable ranging from 15% to 43%. Knowledge about the complex pattern of species composition and distributions between and among topographic levels and river sites is important for the preservation of the diverse flora of the blackwater forests and for the creation of future conservation management plans and design of protected areas in this ecosystem that will maintain the biodiversity.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				JAN	2000	9	1					1	14																WOS:000086323300001
J	Arnott, DL; Vanni, MJ				Arnott, DL; Vanni, MJ			Nitrogen and phosphorus recycling by the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the western basin of Lake Erie	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is an exotic mollusc that has invaded many North American habitats. Because of its abundance and ability to filter large quantities of water, zebra mussels may greatly affect the recycling of nutrients. Therefore, we quantified the nutrient cycling parameters of the zebra mussel in the western basin of Lake Erie. Small mussels excreted less N and more P per gram dry weight than did larger mussels and thus excreted at significantly lower N:P ratios (approximately 5:1 molar) than other size-classes. All size-classes excreted at N:P ratios below 20:1. These low ratios could cause a shift in phytoplankton community structure towards blue-green algae. The concentration of nutrients in the food of the mussels (seston) and mussel tissues also varied seasonally and among mussel size-classes. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that seston and mussel nutrient concentrations can predict a significant amount of variation in mussel N and P excretion rates and ratios in some cases. Comparison of zebra mussel P recycling rates on a basin-wide scale with other P sources suggests that mussels are a major factor in the recycling and flux of P in the western basin of Lake Erie.

The dataset integrates meteorological data, nutrient chemistry, water column profiles for water physics, and plankton underwater imaging, offering insights into the lake's physical and biological processes. A dual-magnification dark field underwater microscope captured hourly plankton dynamics at 3 m depth, providing size, shape, and taxonomic information. A profiler with a multiparametric probe monitored water temperature, oxygen, and other key parameters from 1 to 17 m depth, while weekly nutrient sampling complemented the measurements. Data processing involved rigorous cleaning protocols to remove technical artefacts, ensuring data quality. Our dataset showcases the utility of integrating different approaches for high-frequency monitoring to detect lake temporal processes, from phytoplankton blooms to zooplankton vertical migration and seasonal shifts in water column stability. This dataset provides a unique resource for studying limnology and plankton community ecology. All data and related processing codes are publicly available for further research, supporting interdisciplinary studies.

Reproductive strategy of Oreochromis niloticus (Pisces: cichlidae) in Opa reservoir, Ile-Ife, Nigeria	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The fish family Cichlidae has a large diversity and dominates African freshwater bodies, with over 200 species reported in inland waters. Sampling for the Fish Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus) in Opa reservoir, Nigeria, started in October 1997 and extended until February 2000. The Fishing methods employed for collecting the 1 430 specimens were cast netting and gillnetting. Egg diameter varied between 2.12 mm and 2.69 mm with a mean of 2.47 +/- 0.02. Female gonadosomatic index was 1.34 +/- 0.01 (0.12-4.06, n=637). The male gonadosomatic index was 0.39 +/- 0.02 (0.03-1.67, n= 789). In Opa reservoir, O. niloticus bred throughout the study period. The species was a maternal mouth brooder with the female Fish carrying eggs and fry in the buccal cavities. The sex ratio of O. niloticus was approximately]:I in the reservoir. The fecundity of the species was between 73 eggs and 1 8 10 eggs per female with a mean fecundity of 815 eggs.																			0034-7744					JUN	2007	55	2					595	602											19069769					WOS:000250013300020
J	Savard, JPL; Reed, A; Lesage, L				Savard, Jean-Pierre L.; Reed, Austin; Lesage, Louis			Chronology of breeding and molt migration in surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata)	WATERBIRDS												Little is known about the molt migration of the Surf Scorer (Melanitta perspicillata), a species endemic to North America. Our objective in this study was to document the breeding and molting chronology of Surf Scoters in Quebec. Breeding birds were studied at Lake Malbaie, located about 90 km north of Quebec City, Canada. Surf Scorers arrived at Lake Malbaie in the fourth week of May and most males stayed only for approximately three weeks. This relatively early departure of males from the breeding areas emphasizes the importance of saltwater habitats for these birds. Unsuccessful adult females did not leave with the males but remained on their breeding lake. These females left the lake from mid to late July, nearly a month after the departure of males and much earlier than females with broods which left from mid to late August after abandoning their brood. This departure sequence was observed during the three years of the study. The difference in timing of molt migration between age and sex groups has important management implications as it potentially exposes them to different levels of mortality. For example, late molters, mostly adult females that bred successfully may still be flightless at the beginning of the hunting season in some areas. Better understanding of molt chronology and habitat selection by various sex and age groups will permit a more holistic and efficient management of Surf Scoters.																			1524-4695					JUN	2007	30	2					223	229		10.1675/1524-4695(2007)30[223:COBAMM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2007)30[223:COBAMM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000248130200007
J	Khan, TA				Khan, TA			Dietary studies on exotic carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) from two lakes of western Victoria, Australia	AQUATIC SCIENCES												There is little published information on the impacts of exotic fishes in the shallow slightly saline, closed catchment lakes of western Victoria. The present study assessed the diet of exotic carp (Cyprinus carpio) from two lakes of western Victoria (Lake Colac and Lake Modewarre) between November 1999-September 2001, using a numerical and volumetric method of gut contents analysis. Carp larvae <2 cm total length fed exclusively on microcrustacea (Cladocera and Copepoda). At a mean total length of >2 cm carp larvae shifted their diet to include benthic food resources, but microcrustacea still dominated the larval diet. Small carp (:515 cm) showed a high preference for microcrustacea and tended to avoid benthic macroinvertebrate food resources. As carp size increased the proportion of macroinvertebrates in gut contents increased. Medium (15-40 cm) and large sized carp (>40 cm) displayed broad food assemblages in their guts with microcrustacea, Gastropoda, Ostracoda, Amphipoda and detritus being dominant. Carp showed a selective preference for Diptera and a balanced preference for Amphipoda. Schoener's dietary overlap was high between small and medium carp (0.55-0.65) and medium and large carp (0.72-0.74) but was low between small and large carp (0.36-0.44). When considering only benthic macroinvertebrate food resources, Hurlbert's dietary overlap between size classes of carp remained reasonably low. There were no observable seasonal patterns in the diet of carp in the two lakes but the proportion of the food items in the gut varied between sampling occasions. This study identified the potential of exotic carp in altering lake function by feeding predominantly on microcrustacea, thus causing a 'top-down' trophic cascade.																			1015-1621						2003	65	3					272	286		10.1007/s00027-003-0658-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-003-0658-5													WOS:000185741300010

This research evaluated the impact of anthropogenic activities on water quality and the trophic status of the Pacucha Lagoon, Andahuaylas, Apurimac. Seasonal sampling was conducted at six strategic points on the surface and bottom of the lake, following standardized protocols, during both the dry and rainy seasons. Physical and chemical parameters, metal ions, chlorophyll-a, and trophic status were determined using the Carlson indices, and water quality was assessed through the WQI-PE. The quantification of anthropogenic impacts was performed using the Leopold matrix. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and PCA at 5% significance. The results classify the lake as having "Regular" water quality according to WQI-PE. Physical and chemical parameters remain within the Environmental Quality Standards (ECA-Peru), while heavy metal ions exceed the limits in both seasons. The system exhibits mesotrophic conditions that tend to become eutrophic during the rainy season, suggesting a favorable nutrient balance for biological productivity. Activities with the most significant adverse impacts include agricultural practices that involve the intensive use of agrochemicals, morphological alterations to the surrounding area, and unregulated aquaculture. The lack of effective regulatory mechanisms and a lack of commitment to conservation suggest a high risk of irreversible degradation of the Pacucha Lagoon ecosystem.					; Peralta-Guevara, Diego/IQT-9306-2023; Choque-Quispe, David/ADF-5782-2022	, Yakov/0000-0001-6467-677X; 														2073-4441				APR 15	2025	17	8							1182	10.3390/w17081182	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17081182													WOS:001477238600001

One group of radiocarbon dates places the occupation in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC while a second pushes the occupation to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. We discuss this point in this paper. It is a key site for understanding the first food-production societies in the Horn of Africa because it is one of the earliest sites in the region that has yielded domestic cattle remains. Nevertheless, domesticates seem to have played only a secondary role in Asa Koma's economy. Fish represent by far the most important food resource, and fishing was most likely the main reason why people chose to live at Asa Koma. The site has been the subject of many studies. This paper presents new data that complement these previous studies, namely, a geomorphological assessment of the site and the region, results from a new test-excavation, and results from the study of an additional sample of fish remains. We estimate the mass provided by the different taxa in order to evaluate what proportion of the diet derived from fishing, hunting and stock breeding, respectively. We also summarize and reconsider the hypothesis formulated in a previous study about the season of catch and the processing of the catch for storage. We argue that Lake Abbe was very close to the site at the time of the occupation, and we suspect that fishing (and hence occupation of the site) took place during the annual floods of this lake. We discuss possible indications for fish storage strategies, while acknowledging that the practice of storage continues to be difficult to elucidate from the archaeological evidence.

J	Smith, BD				Smith, Benjamin Daniel			Hunting in yellow waters: an ethnoarchaeological perspective on selective fishing on Lake Turkana	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					23rd Biennial Meeting of the Society-of-the-Africanist-Archaeologist (SAfA)	JUN 26-JUL 02, 2016	Univ Jean Jaures, Toulouse, FRANCE	Soc Africanist Archaeologist	Univ Jean Jaures			As riverine and lacustrine environments expanded across north tropical Africa during early Holocene times, certain characteristic fishing or "aquatic hunting" strategies became widespread. This paper investigates one such strategy and an associated technology: selective fishing and barbed bone "harpoon" points in the Turkana Basin, northwest Kenya. These tools have a geographically widespread distribution across Africa, primarily north of the equator, and can shed light on hunter-gatherer technology and resource acquisition in the face of environmental and social change. Interviews with contemporary Turkana fishers highlight near-shore fishing practices analogous to those of early Holocene hunter-gatherers. For example, Turkana fishers exploiting deltaic "yellow waters" have traditionally employed selective harpoon-like tools to acquire large aquatic fauna like Lates niloticus (Nile perch) and Synodontis sp. (catfish), while using non-selective traps, hooks and nets to catch smaller and deeper-water species. These practices have changed over several decades in response to local socioeconomic and environmental shifts. Today these selective strategies show a marked seasonality and regional variability that the archaeological record of this region has thus far been ill-equipped to investigate. Through carefully constructed analogy, this preliminary work contributes to a better understanding of human technological and behavioral responses to shifting lakeshore environments today and during early Holocene times.

J	Snyder, E; Francis, A; Darbyshire, SJ				Snyder, Eric; Francis, Ardath; Darbyshire, Stephen J.			Biology of invasive alien plants in Canada. 13. Stratiotes aloides L.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												The freshwater aquatic plant species Stratiotes aloides (water soldier) is native to Europe and central Asia, where it occurs in seasonally pleustonic or submergent populations. It has been imported into and cultivated in Canada as an ornamental plant. Recently it has been found escaped or persisting at five locations in south-central Ontario. A large population has established in the Trent River where it was likely present for several years prior to its discovery in 2008. The tendency of S. aloides to form dense floating mats can alter aquatic communities through competition and allelopathy, and is likely to inhibit navigation and recreational activities in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence drainage system should it spread more widely in eastern North America. In Europe it is often abundant in ditches where it impedes flow and increases sedimentation. Moderate success at control has been achieved using herbicides (diquat) in the Trent River population, but manual removal has been inefficient. In spite of these control efforts, the plant is continuing to spread vegetatively downstream. An integrated management plan has been proposed to address its control by: (i) prevention of new introductions (pathway restriction); (ii) early detection and rapid response (newly established or found populations); and, (iii) eradication of known populations.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				APR	2016	96	2					225	242		10.1139/cjps-2015-0188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2015-0188													WOS:000375417700008

Samples were collected by trawling and seining in the Kenyan sector of Lake Victoria between June 1998 and December 2000. Males predominated over females (sex ratio 1.42 : 1 : 00). O. niloticus spawned throughout the year but with a peak between December and June. Length at first maturity was (mean +/- SD) 30.81 +/- 0.09 for females and 34.5 +/- 6 0.48 for males. There was little seasonal variation in relative condition, which ranged from 0.92 to 1.05 in males and 0.94 to 1.07 in females. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was low during the postspawning period (July to October) and high during the protracted breeding period (December and June). Fecundity ranged from 905 to 7619 oocytes for fish of 28 to 51 cm total length (TL) respectively. The relationships between fecundity (F) and total length (L), weight (W) and ovary weight (OW) were: F = 8.159L(1.53), F = 96.269W(0.4504), F = 1806 + 39.4OW. The slope b of the weight-length relationship was 3.08-3.32 for males and 3.07-3.22 for females. Growth was allometric in both cases and was significantly different from the expected value of 3. The life history strategy of O. niloticus is discussed in context of environmental changes occurring in the lake.

J	Trauth, MH; Strecker, MR				Trauth, MH; Strecker, MR			Formation of landslide-dammed lakes during a wet period between 40,000 and 25,000 yr BP in northwestern Argentina	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												New AMS radiocarbon data from the deposits of landslide-dammed lakes in the Santa Maria Basin (26 degrees S, 66 degrees W) and the Quebrada del Toro (25 degrees S, 66 degrees W) in the eastern Argentine Cordillera show that important mass movements occurred during a wet period between 40,000 and 25,000 yr B.P. In addition to increased humidity during this time, detailed analysis of annual-layered lacustrine strata suggests enhanced inter- and intra-annuaI fluctuations in precipitation as compared to the present. Variations in sediment characteristics and diatom assemblages with mean periodicities of 2 to 5 and 10 to 14 years, respectively, suggest an influence of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic sea-surface temperature dipole. The Atlantic dipole slightly increased rainfall every 10-14 years as at present. In contrast, the weak modem ENSO influence in this area differs from the past situation where rainfall increased significantly with ENSO-type periodicities. Both increased humidity and seasonality are believed to have reduced thresholds for the generation of catastrophic mass movements in northwestern Argentina. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These changes can lead to reducing area of the highly productive fertile lands, posing major threats to food security and impacting the regional environment and society. This study assesses land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt, from 1990 to 2018, proposing a technique that considers cropping seasons using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for classification enhancement. Supervised classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to spectral bands for Landsat satellite images covering the study period. Results revealed that the area of the natural reserve of Lake Burullus decreased by approximately 6.3% and that Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate lost approximately 91.5 km2 of agricultural land between 2010 and 2018. This indicates that Kafr El-Sheikh currently suffers from rapid unorganized urban sprawl, leading to a loss of agricultural area at an annual rate of approximately 0.4%. Using the NDVI enhanced the overall classification accuracy by 4.4%. Regular assessment of LULC incorporating higher-resolution data sources is essential in the future for planning, mitigation, and adaptation strategies.

Seasonal effect on trace metal elements behaviour in a reservoir of northern Thailand	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Trace metal elements (TME) can be real threats for living organisms. However, few studies dealt with TME in reservoirs in rural areas where farming practises could induce negative effects. Mae Thang reservoir (northern Thailand) has been studied for 3 years to understand the seasonal behaviour of dissolved TME: Fe, Mn, Cd, Al, Pb, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, U and As and associated physicochemical parameters. In situ measurements of these parameters were done during the dry and the wet seasons as well as water samples along the water column for further analyses and TME determination by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the dry season, the water column was characterized by a strong stratification and anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. High rain and water input from the watershed during the wet season induced mixing of the water. All TME, except Ni, Co and Cr were less concentrated in the wet season indicating a dilution effect by water input. There was thus no important dissolved pollution coming from the watershed. The anoxic conditions in the dry season enhanced the reduction of Fe and Mn and the desorption processes. Depth, and thus oxic-anoxic conditions were the main drivers of TME in the dry season, while in the wet season, dissolution processes from parent rocks of watershed were favoured. The average concentrations of TME in the reservoir were in the limit of the international and Thai standards. Only localized values in the bottom of the reservoir for Fe and Mn were higher than the limits.					; JANEAU, Jean-Louis/P-8143-2017; Janeau, Jean-Louis/P-8143-2017; SEYLER, Patrick/D-6024-2013; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016; Grellier, Séraphine/AAP-6481-2020; SEYLER, Patrick/AAD-1208-2020	Grellier, Seraphine/0000-0002-4735-2957; Janeau, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-1410-6573; SEYLER, Patrick/0000-0003-3390-0614; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/0000-0002-3950-4041; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2013	185	7					5523	5536		10.1007/s10661-012-2964-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2964-7								23108711					WOS:000319753600014
J	Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sánchez, JM; Cruz-Pizarro, L; Carrillo, P				Villar-Argaiz, M; Medina-Sánchez, JM; Cruz-Pizarro, L; Carrillo, P			Inter- and intra-annual variability in the phytoplankton community of a high mountain lake: the influence of external (atmospheric) and internal (recycled) sources of phosphorus	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The inter- and intra-annual changes in the biomass, elemental (carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and taxonomical composition of the phytoplankton in a high mountain lake in Spain were studied during 3 years with different physical (fluctuating hydrological regime) and chemical conditions. The importance of internal and external sources of P to the phytoplankton was estimated as the amount of P supplied via zooplankton recycling (internal) or through ice-melting and atmospheric deposition (external). 2. Inter-annual differences in phytoplankton biomass were associated with temperature and total dissolved phosphorus. In 1995, phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with total dissolved phosphorus. In contrast, the negative relationship between zooplankton and seston biomass (direct predatory effects) and the positive relationship between zooplankton P excretion and phytoplankton biomass in 1997 (indirect P-recycling effects), reinforces the primary role of zooplankton in regulating the total biomass of phytoplankton but, at the same time, encouraging its growth via P-recycling. 3. Year-to-year variations in seston C : P and N : P ratios exceeded intra-annual variations. The C : P and N : P ratios were high in 1995, indicating strong P limitation. In contrast, in 1996 and 1997, these ratios were low during ice-out (C : P < 100 and N : P < 10) and increased markedly as the season progressed. Atmospheric P load to the lake was responsible for the decline in C : P and N : P ratios. 4. Intra-annual variations in zooplankton stoichiometry were more pronounced than the overall differences between 1995 and 1996. Thus, the zooplankton N : P ratio ranged from 6.9 to 40.1 (mean 21.4) in 1995, and from 10.4 to 42.2 (mean 24.9) in 1996. The zooplankton N : P ratio tended to be low after ice-out, when the zooplankton community was dominated by copepod nauplii, and high towards mid- and late-season, when these were replaced by copepodites and adults. 5. In 1995, the minimum demands for P of phytoplankton were satisfied by ice-melting, atmospheric loading and zooplankton recycling over 100%. In order of importance, atmospheric inputs (> 1000%), zooplankton recycling (9-542%), and ice-melting processes (0.37-5.16%) satisfied the minimum demand for P of phytoplankton during 1996 and 1997. Although the effect of external forces was rather sporadic and unpredictable in comparison with biologically driven recycle processes, both may affect phytoplankton structure and elemental composition.

Complex feedbacks are controlled by precipitation changes and soil hydraulic and thermal properties, amongst many factors. The Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) is the largest drainage basin in Canada (1.8x106 km2), underlain by permafrost of various classes for most of its extent (70-80% by area). Changes to the MRB affect atmospheric feedback, inflows to the Arctic Ocean, and local environments and communities. This study aims to parameterize a land surface hydrology model (MESH) for the MRB to simulate the coevolution of hydrology and permafrost dynamics, and hence enable the investigation of future change impacts. MESH, designed to simulate cold region processes, couples energy and water exchanges and requires a deep soil profile and long spin-up periods to initialize the permafrost regime at depth. Calibration was restricted to a limited number of influential physical parameters using streamflow from representative sub-basins. Validation used streamflow, snowpack, and snow cover across the basin. Sensitivity and identifiability analyses at well-instrumented sub-surface temperature gauges identified key parameters for permafrost simulation, which were adjusted for consistency with the spatial distribution of permafrost occurrence provided by available datasets and maps. To confirm permafrost prediction accuracy, validations were performed at gauges where active layer depth or soil temperature were observed. The resulting model has high fidelity in simulating both the hydrology and permafrost dynamics in the basin. This suggests that the model can be used with confidence to predict the impacts of future climate, land use/cover, and management scenarios on the evolution of cold region hydrology and permafrost at large scales.

Hydrologically-mediated resource availability regulates annual wading bird breeding in a littoral marsh	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Resource density, timing, duration, and accessibility can strongly affect the reproductive responses of consumers. For applied models of resource availability to be most useful, they must account for spatiotemporal variation in each of these factors. Here, we developed a foraging habitat model for wading birds (Ardeidae, Ciconiidae, and Threskiornithidae) in an extensive (>400 km2) fringe wetland in a shallow subtropical lake (Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA). Our model accounts for hydrological processes that influence wading bird prey resource density, and area and timing of habitat accessibility. The resulting spatiotemporally dynamic model estimates resource availability for wading birds at a local scale (30.5-m grid cells). We assessed whether our model could explain wading bird productivity by hindcasting estimates over fourteen nesting seasons (2006-2019) and quantifying the relationship between aggregated measures of resource availability and breeding productivity (nest abundance and nest survival) for four wading bird species. We found that hydropatterns that increase fish productivity and concentrate fish biomass over hierarchically nested spatiotemporal scales regulate resource availability for wading birds. Wading bird nest abundance increased with the number of available-habitat-days for feeding in the wetland during the breeding season. Furthermore, nest survival for two of three wading bird species increased with available-habitat-days within the foraging range of a nest. Overall, we found that more birds nested with greater success when our models indicated the continual appearance of new foraging habitat throughout the nesting season. The results of this study indicate that managing wetlands for waterbirds will require water management regimes that prioritize hydrological processes that are linked over multiple spatiotemporal scales.

Adaptive cluster sampling: Estimating density of spatially autocorrelated larvae of the sea lamprey with improved precision	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Adaptive cluster sampling (ACS) provides researchers with an alternative technique to estimate the abundance of rare or spatially clustered organisms, but its application infield investigations has been limited to relatively few studies. We used ACS to estimate parameters of a spatially autocorrelated population of larval sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus, in Wilmot Creek, a Lake Ontario tributary. When compared with simple random sampling (SRS), ACS significantly increased catch per sample as well as the percentage of samples that contained larvae. Although ASC-generated samples are spatially biased, the use of established formulae enabled us to calculate unbiased estimators of mean larval density and variance. With ACS, variance was reduced, improving the precision around estimates of mean density, however; increased precision came at the price of greater sampling effort. When variance was adjusted for effort, ASC provided equal or greater efficiency than SRS in 33% of sampling events, with no apparent site or seasonal bias. Based on the knowledge that larval sea lampreys are spatially aggregated, we anticipated that ACS would result in higher precision for a greater proportion of sampling events. Nonetheless, we consider ACS to be a useful technique for evaluating larval sea lamprey populations and anticipate increased application for investigating other spatially over-dispersed species.																			0380-1330					MAR	2008	34	1					86	97		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[86:ACSEDO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[86:ACSEDO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000255209400007

Agricultural land-use change seasonally rewires stream food webs: a case study from headwater streams in the Lake Erie watershed	FACETS												Human impacts, like agricultural land-use change, alter natural patterns of resource availability and consumer response through space and time threatening the stability of ecosystems. In streams, removal of riparian zones and nutrient loading through agriculture may alter seasonal asynchronous resource fluxes and lead to food web rewiring and stability loss. Here, we seasonally sampled three streams across an agricultural gradient to determine how agricultural land-use change rewires seasonal stream food web structures. We show that agricultural land-use change seasonally rewired trophic interactions through reduced terrestrial energy use and trophic position. Additionally, agricultural land-use change drove steeper biomass size spectrum slopes and shifted fish communities to high abundances of small individuals. Collectively, our results suggest agricultural land-use change may be homogenizing stream food webs towards productive, single-energy channel dominated webs with faster turnover rates. Theory predicts such changes are indicative of instability, suggesting agriculture may be destabilizing stream food webs. Importantly, our results indicate agricultural land-use strategies that aim to retain riparian zones and reduce nutrient run-off may be important for reducing potential destabilizing effects. As agriculture is expected to increase to support growing human populations, elucidating strategies to maintain resilient stream food webs in agricultural landscapes is essential.					; Gutgesell, Marie/HOF-3300-2023	Gutgesell, Marie/0000-0001-7561-7409; 													2371-1671					APR 7	2025	10						1	13		10.1139/facets-2023-0196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/facets-2023-0196													WOS:001466122800001
J	Mann, ME; Park, J				Mann, ME; Park, J			Joint spatiotemporal modes of surface temperature and sea level pressure variability in the northern hemisphere during the last century	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Coherent spatiotemporal modes of climatic variability are isolated based on a multivariate frequency domain singular value decomposition (SVD) of nearly a century of monthly Northern Hemisphere sea level pressure (SLP) and surface temperature data. Insight into the underlying physical processes associated with potential climatic signals is obtained by examining the relationship between surface temperature and inferred atmospheric circulation patterns as they evolve over the a typical cycle, taking potential seasonal distinctions into account. Our analysis provides evidence for two significant independent secular variations describing a secular warming trend (and accompanying changes in circulation patterns) and a century timescale ''oscillation'' marked by high-amplitude variations in temperature and SLP in the North Atlantic that are similar to those observed in recent model simulations. Quasi-oscillatory interdecadal (16-18 yr timescale) variability also displays a pattern similar to those predicted in recent model experiments, with an apparent origin in the North Pacific. Weaker quasi-decadal (10-11-yr timescale), largely cold-season oscillatory behavior is more closely tied to the North Atlantic and may involve analogous mechanisms. Interannual variability is examined with an ''evolutive'' generalization of our procedure to captures the time-evolving frequency and amplitude characteristics of the associated climate signal. Variability exhibiting the characteristic climatic patterns of the global El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is described by two largely distinct frequency bands within the broader 3-7-yr ENSO band. The drifting central frequencies of these two dominant bands is suggestive of nonstationary behavior in ENSO. A quasibiennial signal exhibits a gradual trend toward increasing frequency. Prospects for improved long-range climate forecasting are discussed.

These reference values are often treated as constants, whereas in reality they can be highly variable. Here, we study the significance of this variability for assessments of human impact on the environment, by using almost two decades of observations from 95 acid-sensitive Swedish lakes. Our approach was to first estimate the preindustrial, steady-state reference level of acid neutralization capacity (ANC) for each lake with the hydro-geochemical model MAGIC. Then the variability in pH around this "baseline" was reconstructed from the contemporary, "natural" variability in the ANC, total organic carbon (TOC) and Al-concentrations, and partial CO2 pressure. The variability in reference pH was then examined for the period 1990-2004, on seasonal (single measurements), interannual (1-year median), and decadal (5-year median) scales. On the seasonal scale, the variability in reference pH ranged between 0.40 and 1.7. The range on the interannual time scale was up to 1.3 units and for the decadal scale up to 0.76 units. Since an anthropogenic pH decline of more than 0.4 units is deemed significant according to the Swedish Environmental Quality Criteria, this natural variability clearly needs to be accounted for when assessing acidification.

After 33 months 82-90% of the leaf and 39-43% of the culm mass was lost, corresponding to a fibre loss of 82-90% and 32-35%, respectively. The N, C and S concentrations increased as decomposition proceeded, while the P concentrations decreased. The decaying coefficient model gave the best fit of the mathematical models tested (single exponential, decaying coefficient and composite exponential model). No significant differences in decomposition rates were detected between the two sites.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2004	89	5-6					519	535		10.1002/iroh.200410772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200410772													WOS:000226419900009

Water column ammonium regeneration supports productivity in two large, eutrophic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton often rely on the regeneration of ammonium (NH4+) to produce biomass and, for some cyanobacteria, nitrogen-rich toxins, despite low or unmeasurable NH4+ concentrations in water. Thus, measuring NH4+ turnover rates (i.e., uptake and regeneration) is necessary to determine its actual availability. The objectives of this study were to quantify water column NH4+ turnover rates in two large, shallow, eutrophic, cyanobacteria-dominated lakes in Estonia (Lakes Vortsjarv and Peipsi), explore which in-lake variables drive these processes, and evaluate the importance of internal nitrogen loading in supporting community NH4+ uptake. Stable isotope (NH(4)(+)15) incubations were conducted almost monthly in Vartsjarv and several times per year in Peipsi (from March 2019 to March 2022). Despite being located at a higher latitude, NH4+ turnover rates in Vortsjarv and Peipsi were similar to those reported for other large, eutrophic lakes. NH4+ turnover rates were strongly related to seasonally changing water quality variables, including temperature, nutrient concentrations, and chlorophyll a concentrations, which, combined, explained 68-71% of the variation in measured rates. NH4+ regeneration supported, on average, 65.2% +/- 9.6% (in Vortsjarv) and 75.6% +/- 16.8% (in Peipsi) of community NH4+ uptake during the warm season (May to October). For 2020, estimated internal nitrogen loading from NH4+ regeneration in the water column exceeded, by similar to 18 times, estimated external nitrogen loading to Vortsjarv from the three main inflows. These results emphasize the importance of internal nitrogen loading in driving primary productivity in lakes and highlight the necessity to reduce external nitrogen loading, in addition to phosphorus, into eutrophic lakes.

Water is stored in man-made reservoirs, groundwater aquifers, the soil, natural lakes and wetlands. Ideally, to meet any water demand, these water storage options could be used in an integrated manner. However, integrating suites of water storage options in the management for water, food, energy, and the environment is limited in practice. One of the reasons for this is the lack of knowledge on the volume and temporal dynamics of the different storage types. This study therefore assessed water storage in different storage types and their temporal dynamics using remote sensing and secondary data in the Tana-Beles sub-basin of Ethiopia. The results show that the active total storage volume in the sub-basin varies from 7.3 BCM to 16.2 BCM in dry and wet months, respectively. Lake Tana storage is the largest with 50% of total storage while built reservoirs only account for 2% of the same. Given different competing needs and constraints from each storage options not all the water in the storages can be utilized. Optimizing natural and built storage options in an integrated system can maximize water security gains.

Consistent and transient drivers of freshwater zooplankton communities	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Inferences of the predominant processes that structure communities are commonly based on single 'snapshots' in time, which may miss temporally transient but important mechanisms. In this study, we compared key environmental and spatial drivers of zooplankton composition across multiple years to quantify shifts in their relative importance through time, and to identify any drivers of temporal change. Location Southern Ontario, Canada. Taxon Zooplankton. Methods Zooplankton were collected from 29 lakes in southern Ontario, Canada over four years (2013-2016). Variation partitioning was used to quantify the relative importance of independent and covarying components of local environmental conditions, regional east-west and north-south compositional trends, and inter-lake geographic distance in each year. Measured environmental metrics included aspects of lake morphology and chemistry, and spatial relationships were quantified using lake latitude/longitude coordinates and Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEMs). Redundancy analyses (RDAs) were also used to compare the influence of individual environmental and spatial variables across years. Results Most local-scale and regional-scale community processes were consistently important across all surveyed years, but some were less consistent. Specifically, geomorphology was always an important driver of local environmental and regional spatial community patterns. This occurred because local community composition was strongly affected by whether a lake was shallower versus deeper, and due to spatial clusters of shallow and deep lakes that produced negative spatial autocorrelation in community composition. Conversely, the individual influences of lake chemistry and spatial east-west compositional trends were important in some years and not in others, potentially due to inter-annual shifts in the predominant environmental variables and extreme weather events. Main conclusions A single-year community snapshot can provide insight into consistent or slowly changing community structuring processes, such as those driven by geomorphology, but may not completely capture temporally transient mechanisms. Furthermore, snapshots collected during anomalous seasons or years may misrepresent which mechanisms are predominantly determining community composition. Future efforts to understand local and regional community drivers would therefore benefit from considering which processes are likely temporally 'consistent' versus 'transient', and studies with more variable components would benefit from considering or controlling for temporal shifts in their importance.

J	Rosenqvist, Å; Birkett, CM				Rosenqvist, Å; Birkett, CM			Evaluation of JERS-1 SAR mosaics for hydrological applications in the Congo river basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Two JERS-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mosaics covering central Africa were investigated with respect to their potential usefulness for studies of seasonal flooding dynamics in the Congo river basin. The mosaic quality was initially evaluated with respect to geometric and radiometric accuracy, as well as to the temporal composition of the data used in the mosaic assembly. The investigation revealed no major defects that should prevent utilization of the data for hydrological applications. The state of flooding captured in each of the two mosaics-preferably portraying the Congo and its tributaries during their annual maximum and minimum water marks-was furthermore evaluated by examining river stage information. Stage data contemporary with the satellite acquisitions (1996) were derived from the TOPEX/POSEIDON Radar Altimeter and supplemented by historical in situ records. The results suggest that the SAR mosaics may serve well to appraise the maximum extents of flooding in the Congo river basin, but quite poorly to assess the dynamics and ranges of the variations. It was reckoned that a minimum of three acquisitions within 1 year would be required to better describe the complex hydrology in the region. The validation uncertainty in rivers where only historical in situ data were available was evident, thus stressing the utility and future potential of radar altimetry to provide substitute measurements of river stages.																			0143-1161					APR	2002	23	7					1283	1302		10.1080/01431160110092902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160110092902													WOS:000174661900006
J	Williams, MW; Losleben, MV; Hamann, HB				Williams, MW; Losleben, MV; Hamann, HB			Alpine areas in the Colorado Front Range as monitors of climate change and ecosystem response	GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												The presence of a seasonal snowpack in alpine environments can amplify climate signals. A conceptual model is developed for the response of alpine ecosystems in temperate, midlatitude areas to changes in energy, chemicals, and water, based on a case study from Green Lakes Valley-Niwot Ridge, a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. A linear regression shows the increase in annual precipitation of about 300 millimeters from 1951 to 1996 to be significant. Most of the precipitation increase has occurred since 1967. The annual deposition of inorganic nitrogen in wetfall at the Niwot Ridge National Atmospheric Deposition Program site roughly doubled between 1985-1988 and 1989-1992. Storage and release of strong acid anions, such as those from the seasonal snowpack in an ionic pulse, have resulted in episodic acidification of surface waters. These biochemical changes alter the quantity and quality of organic matter in high-elevation catchments of the Rocky Mountains. Affecting the bottom of the food chain, the increase in nitrogen deposition may be partly responsible for the current decline of bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains.																			0016-7428					APR	2002	92	2					180	191		10.2307/4140969	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4140969													WOS:000181113300003

We also evaluated the structure of the algal communities and its relation to environmental characteristics for the different stream types. Algal communities, were generally dominated by diatoms, Cyanophyta, and Hydrurusfoetidus (Chrysophyceae). Community structure was similar among alpine streams and lake outlets, but more algal taxa occurred in take outlets (rhithral and kryal) than in kryal streams. Although algae were identified mainly to genera, distinct patterns in community structure were evident. A major environmental determinant of the algal community among stream types was the presence of a glacier and resulting seasonal differences in flow, temperature. and turbidity. An upstream lake was a secondary determinant in buffering seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions thus leading to greater stability. Algal communities, consequently, were more diverse and less seasonally variable at lake outlets. The diatom genera Amphora, Denticula, Fragilaria, Gomphonema, Nitzschia, and Synedra and the blue-green algae Oscillatoria and Phormidium were characteristic of lake outlets, whereas Chamaesiphon (blue-green) and Hydrurus foetidus were indicative of kryal sites.

However, the underlying driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the temporal patterns of biodiversity and community stability over the past century by constructing 29 temporal planktonic network models. These models were based on the sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) extracted from downcore sediments of Lake Chagan, a seasonally frozen lake in Northeastern China, using high-throughput sequencing techniques. Our findings identified the mid-1990s as a critical tipping point, marked by substantial shifts in nutrient levels and annual average temperatures. We demonstrated that the temporal network stability of plankton communities was predominantly compromised by climate warming, followed by nutrient enrichment. This study highlights the intricate interplay between biotic and abiotic factors that determine the stability of aquatic ecological networks, which has important implications for the management and conservation of freshwater ecosystems facing ongoing climate warming.

Total lipids from muscle were extracted and quantified according to the Bligh and Dyer method. FA identification was performed by GC-MS of FA methyl esters and FA pyrrolidides and led to the identification of 41 FA; routine analyses of FA were made by capillary GC. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the data set to compare FA profiles. Lipid content is low, ranging from 0.91 to 1.73% of wet muscle, with a low stage during the hot season (January-April) and a higher stage during the cold season (July-October). Three FA dominated the FA composition: oleic acid (17.0-21.5%), palmitic acid (13.1-16.1%), and linoleic acid (9.6-13.2%). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were present in appreciable amounts: arachidonic acid (PA; 2.9-5.9%), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 2.9-6.7%), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 1.9-3.4%), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 1.9-4.3%). Two opposite evolution schemes appear within two groups of FA; on the one hand PUFA (both n-3 and n-6 series) show a maximum in August-October and a minimum in January-April, and, on the other hand, oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids show the opposite maxima and minima. PCA results give confirmation of these evolution schemes, the two groups of FA giving opposite high factor loadings on axis 1. The SIS and ITA series are differentiated by axis 2 by mean of minor FA, mostly odd- and branched-chain. Results indicate that common carp, the second most abundant freshwater fish in Madagascar highlands waters, may be an interesting source of dietary PUFA.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				DEC 1	2004	52	24					7339	7344		10.1021/jf048993y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048993y								15563217					WOS:000225358900024

In addition to seston, species may feed on biofilms growing on sediments, plants (epiphyton), and at the air-water interface (neuston). However, despite a growing interest in these different biofilms, little is known about their food quality for microcrustaceans. In a field study, we measured changes in the food quality over time in terms of the essential fatty acid (EFA) content of different potential food sources for littoral consumers. The food quality of seston, neuston, and epiphyton growing on three different aquatic macrophytes were assessed. Our results showed that there is an important seasonal variability within each food source. However, in the system studied, epiphytic biofilms, especially those of Ludwigia and Callitriche offered the highest food quality, in terms of EFA content, throughout the year. As the highest EFA concentrations in each food source were found consecutively, high concentrations of these physiologically important compounds are maintained in the system throughout the year. Therefore, greater diversity of food resources could affect ecosystem productivity.					; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Bec, Alexandre/0000-0003-4353-3766; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2014	736	1					127	137		10.1007/s10750-014-1898-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1898-1													WOS:000338027700010

The effect of seasonality on the structure of rotifers in a black-water shallow lake in Central Amazonia	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Rotifers have often been used as indicators of sudden changes in physical and chemical features of the aquatic environment. Such features vary greatly during flood pulse events in small lakes connected to major floodplains. However, few are the studies that investigate the consequences of the flood pulse in rotifer species composition, abundance, richness and diversity, especially in Amazonian lakes. We analyzed samples from a small blackwater lake of an "igarap" connected permanently to the Negro river, in Central Amazonia. Samples were taken twice a year for two years, comprising flooding and receding periods of the flood pulse. Rotifer abundance increased significantly after draught events, and electrical conductivity and turbidity were intrinsically related to such variation. Species composition also changed from flooding to receding periods. Some taxa, such as Brachionus zahniseri reductus and Lecane remanei were restricted to receding periods, while Brachionus zahniseri, Brachionus gillardi and Lecane proiecta were only present during flooding. A shift in the composition of rotifer families was observed from one period to another, showing the effect of renewing waters of the flood pulse. These results suggest that the flood pulse acts as a driving force and stressing condition, considerably altering rotifer community dynamics, either changing species composition or decreasing abundance.					; Lopes, Vanessa/HHN-7848-2022	Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; 													0001-3765	1678-2690				SEP	2014	86	3					1359	1372		10.1590/0001-3765201420130323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765201420130323								25119730					WOS:000342063300031

A detailed taxonomic list of the phytoplankton species is recorded, along with light micrographs and detailed descriptions of the flagellates. A deep chorophyll maximum, mainly built by Planktothrix rubescens, was common in this deep mesotrophic lake. The three most dominant species among 83 identified taxa alternated seasonally and reached significant biovolumes in both the epi- and the metalimnion (Planktothrix rubescens>Ceratium hirundinella>unicellular centric diatoms>Asterionella formosa>Fragilaria spp.>Anabaena lemmermannii>Phacotus lenticularis and less frequent dominant was Rhodomonas minuta). We define a steady state phytoplankton assemblage in Ammersee as a stable community in terms of species composition and standing crop. The stability of species composition was measured by Bray-Curtis similarity between monthly samples and indicate the change of individual biovolumes of species from month to month. The stability of standing crop was evaluated by the net change of total biovolume for the same time intervals. Focussing on steady state phytoplankton assemblages we compared three spatially heterogeneous environments for vertical niche separation within the top 12 m: the euphotic epilimnion (2 and 5 m), the euphotic metalimnion (7 m) and the metalimnion below the euphotic zone with dim-light less than 1% (10 and 12 m). The definition of a steady state assemblage on both ends hold true only for metalimnetic layers at dim-light levels below 1% in Ammersee. At this metalimnetic layer more than 80% similarity in phytoplankton composition between successive monthly samples was reached, associated with almost zero net changes of total biovolume only. The greater the contribution of the three most dominant taxa to biovolume, the higher were the Bray-Curtis similarities at metalimnetic depths below the euphotic zone. Zooplankton biomass had very little effect on species assemblages in the metalimnion, while parameters related to stratification (Schmidt stability) as well as those of trophy (TP, Chl) correlated with species changes. The similarity values between successive monthly samples from all the euphotic layers never reached more than 60% and were usually significantly lower, even if biovolume net changes were around zero. Both the high fluctuations of the ratio of photosynthetic versus photo-protective carotenoids (PSC:PPC) and the statistical significance of correlations between the change of species and environmental-biotic parameters separate the euphotic layer of the top 7 m as a homogenous community from deeper strata. At all sampling depths within this euphotic zone the increase of sunshine duration was associated with an increase of the carotenoid ratio PSC: PPC, but no relationship was found for the deeper layers. The change of species in the euphotic layer was not significantly related to thermal stability, TP or the dominance structure of phytoplankton, but linked with the zooplankton biomass and therefore seemed to be top-down controlled. From our observations, we can conclude that only during stratification and only in the metalimnion below the euphotic zone steady state assemblages can be expected in the deep mesotrophic Ammersee.

Land Cover Classification Model Using Multispectral Satellite Images Based on a Deep Learning Synergistic Semantic Segmentation Network	SENSORS												Land cover classification (LCC) using satellite images is one of the rapidly expanding fields in mapping, highlighting the need for updating existing computational classification methods. Advances in technology and the increasing variety of applications have introduced challenges, such as more complex classes and a demand for greater detail. In recent years, deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly enhanced the segmentation of satellite images. Since the training of CNNs requires sophisticated and expensive hardware and significant time, using pre-trained networks has become widespread in the segmentation of satellite image. This study proposes a hybrid synergistic semantic segmentation method based on the Deeplab v3+ network and a clustering-based post-processing scheme. The proposed method accurately classifies various land cover (LC) types in multispectral satellite images, including Pastures, Other Built-Up Areas, Water Bodies, Urban Areas, Grasslands, Forest, Farmland, and Others. The post-processing scheme includes a spectral bag-of-words model and K-medoids clustering to refine the Deeplab v3+ outputs and correct possible errors. The simulation results indicate that combining the post-processing scheme with deep learning improves the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) by approximately 5.7% compared to the baseline method. Additionally, the proposed approach is robust to data imbalance cases and can dynamically update its codewords over different seasons. Finally, the proposed synergistic semantic segmentation method was compared with several state-of-the-art segmentation methods in satellite images of Italy's Lake Garda (Lago di Garda) region. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed the best existing techniques by at least 6% in terms of MCC.

The temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) of lake water were continuously observed from March 10, 2014 to April 15, 2016. The thermocline and chemocline located deeper than -90 m subsided 15 m in the observation period due to the bottom water removal by the CO2 degassing pipes. The velocity of subsidence was estimated quantitatively by correlating the time variation of EC obtained by AOB and the depth profile of EC. The velocity of subsidence was not constant, namely, it was fast in dry season and slow in rainy season. The time variation in the velocity of subsidence can be attributed to the seasonal variation of water flux in the degassing pipes. Considering the water balance in the deep part of lake, the flux of ground water supplied to lake was estimated to be 6.5*10(6) (m(3)/year), which is comparable to the recharge rate of ground water within the catchment area surrounding Lake Nyos. Abrupt drops in temperature and conductivity were observed at -120 m in January 2016, when the temperature at -4 m reached 21.8 degrees C as the lowest value. The abrupt drops are due to the sinking of surface cold water.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				DEC	2020	172								103976	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103976													WOS:000590387100020
J	Ortloff, CR				Ortloff, Charles R.			Water Engineering at Precolumbian AD 600-1100 Tiwanaku's Urban Center (Bolivia)	WATER												The pre-Columbian World Heritage site of Tiwanaku (AD 600-1100) located in highland altiplano Bolivia is shown to have a unique urban water supply system with many advanced hydraulic and hydrological features. By use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of the city water system, new revelations as to the complexity of the water system are brought forward. The water system consists of a perimeter drainage channel surrounding the ceremonial center of the city. A network of surface canals and subterranean channels connected to the perimeter drainage channel are supplied by multiple canals from a rainfall collection reservoir. The perimeter drainage channel provides rapid draining of rainy season rainfall runoff together with aquifer drainage of intercepted rainfall; water collected in the perimeter drainage channel is then directed to the Tiwanaku River then on to Lake Titicaca. During the dry season aquifer drainage continues into the perimeter drainage channel; additional water is directed into the drainage channel from a recently discovered, reservoir connected M channel. Two subterranean channels beneath the ceremonial center were supplied by M channel water delivered into the perimeter drainage channel that served to remove waste from the ceremonial center structures conveyed to the nearby Tiwanaku River. From control of the water supply to/from the perimeter drainage channel during wet and dry seasonal changes, stabilization of the deep groundwater level was achieved-this resulted in the stabilization of monumental ceremonial structure's foundations, a continuous water supply to inner city agricultural zones, water pools for urban use and health benefits for the city population through moisture level reduction in city ceremonial and secular urban housing structures.																				2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3562	10.3390/w12123562	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123562													WOS:000602983900001

The heat exchange between air-water interfaces is one of the important ways to govern the temperature of the water surface. Heat exchange between the air-water interfaces and the surrounding environment is completed by solar radiation, conduction, and evaporation, and all these processes mainly occur at the air-water interface. Hulun Lake was the biggest lake which is also an important link and an indispensable part of the water cycle in Northeast China. This study mapped surface energy budget to better understand spatial and temporal variations in Hulun Lake in China from 2001 to 2018. Descriptive statistics were computed to build a historical time series of mean monthly heat flux at daytime and nighttime from June to September during 2001-2018. Remote sensing estimation methods we used was suitable for Hulun Lake (R-2 = 0.81). At month scale, shortwave radiation and latent heat flux were decrease from June to September. However, the maximum sensible heat flux appeared in September. Net longwave radiation was the largest in August. The effective heat budget showed that Hulun Lake gained heat in the frost-free season with highest value in June (686.31 W/m(2)), and then steadily decreased to September (439.76 W/m(2)). At annual scale, net longwave radiation, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux all show significant growth trend from 2001 to 2018 (P < 0.01). Wind speed had the well correlation on sensible heat flux and latent heat flux. Water surface temperature showed the highest coefficient in sensitivity analysis.

J	Batista, BD; Fonseca, BM				Batista, Bruno Dias; Fonseca, Barbara Medeiros			Phytoplankton in the central region of Paranoa Lake, Federal District of Brazil: an ecological and sanitary approach	ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL												This study aimed at analyzing the dynamic, the structure and the sanitary importance of phytoplankton in a vertical profile at Paranoa Lake central region, Federal District, Brazil. Sampling was carried out monthly from October 2009 to September 2010, in six depths. Three distinct phases were identified, concerning mixing pattern: stratification (October 2009 to May 2010), mixing in (June to September 2010), transition (September 2010). Total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and algal biomass were relatively low, classifying Paranoa Lake as an oligotrophic reservoir. In opposite, total nitrogen nd functional groups were typical of mesotrophic environments. Altogether, 94 phytoplanktonic taxa were found, among 10 taxonomic classes, especially centrales diatoms, chlorophyceans and cyanobacteria. Thirteen functional groups were identified, with emphasis on C,J, F, X2, K and Si. During mixing and transition months there was an increase in diatom biomass (group C). On the vertical profile, there was a trend of K and S1 groups to locate at surface layers during warmer months. Considering the sanitary approach, this study reported algal taxa that can potentially promote odor and taste in the water (e.g., diatoms, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria) or cause filter clogging at water treatment plants (e.g., diatoms). Moreover, cyanobacterial taxa (e.g., Aphanocapsa and Planktolyngbya) were reported under densities that already point out the need of monitoring intensification and cyanotoxin analysis, according to the MS Ordinance number 2,914/2011.

These factors combine to create diverse water types which change their compositional character spatially as rainfall infiltrates the soil zone, moves down a topographically defined flow path, and interacts with bedrock minerals. Low-salinity waters, which represent the initial stage of underground circulation, start dissolving calcium carbonate from the local rocks. The progressive increase in salinity, characterized by substantially higher Ca, SO4, Na and Cl concentrations, suggests that dissolution of CaSO4 and NaCl is an important process during water-rock interactions. The "Biviere di Gela" lake is often separated into two units (Lago Grande and Lago Piccolo). "Lago Grande" water is generally of Na-SO4-Cl-type, whereas "Lago Piccolo" water is of Na-Cl-SO4-type. Their total content of dissolved salts varies with season, the amount of rainfall, and inflow of ground and drainage water. Over time, an increasing trend towards greater salinity and also sudden changes in the relative abundances of Cl and SO4 have been recorded for the "Lago Grande." The isotope composition of the lake water appears to be affected by inflow of ground and surface waters and also by evaporative loss. The nitrate content of waters from the recharge basin is of particular concern because it contributes to lake eutrophication. The trace element contents do not evidence the presence of any significant metal contamination of lake waters, although a future potential hazard of metals bioaccumulation by the aquatic biota must be taken into consideration. Finally, a water balance for the basin shows that a drop in precipitation of about 20% might be critical for lake survival.

The plume propagates upwards reaching a level of neutral buoyancy from where a turbidity current spreads out laterally. Two-dimensional temperature and particle concentration measurements show the fate of the hydrothermal plume and its associated turbidity current and reveal its seasonal development. Silt particles transported by the plume have been used as tracers to determine the maximum and equilibrium heights of the plume. When the lake is stratified, the vertical transport of sediment is confined to the lake hypolimnion, as the thermocline limits the vertical propagation of the plume. In contrast, when the lake water column is mixed, the plume reaches the surface of the lake. The field measurements have been compared with models for thermal convection from finite isolated sources. Measurements of the flow velocity at the source of the hydrothermal plume (i.e. the rim current velocity) indicate that cold hypolimnetic water is entrained by the plume. Sedimentation rates measured from sediment traps at the zone where the turbidity current develops vary between 10 and 25 g m(-2) day(-1), and result from continuous silt particle sedimentation from the turbidity current. Sedimentation rates in traps are higher for stations situated close to the source than those further away (< 5 g m(-2) day(-1)). Moreover, the results demonstrate that double diffusive sedimentation from the turbidity current was dominant over grain-by-grain settling, causing a mixed distribution of sediments in the region where the turbidity current spreads. The deposition of silt particles could explain the occurrence of silt layers interbedded with biocalcarenites in the littoral zones of the lake and the stratigraphy identified by seismic profiles and cores taken from the lake floor.

C	O'Connor, JE; Grant, GE; Costa, JE		House, PK; Webb, RH; Baker, VR; Levish, DR		O'Connor, JE; Grant, GE; Costa, JE			The geology and geography of floods	ANCIENT FLOODS, MODERN HAZARDS: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF PALEOFLOOD HYDROLOGY	WATER SCIENCE AND APPLICATION				2nd International Paleoflood Conference	SEP 27-29, 1999	PRESCOTT, AZ	US Bur Reclamat, Natl Sci Fdn, Hydrol Sci Program, USGS Western Reg Competit Grants Program Water Resources Res, INQUA Global Commiss Content Paleohydrol, Desert Res Inst, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Arizona Geol Survey				From a global perspective, the magnitude, duration, and volume of riverine floods vary widely depending on source mechanism, global location, geology, and physiography. But despite this variance, there are real physical limits as to how large a flood can be. Meteorological floods result from individual storms of various types that deliver water volumes as great as 10(11) m(3) over a few days or weeks as well as from seasonally persistent climate patterns that deliver upwards of 10(12) m(3) over several weeks or months and cause peak discharges of as much as 10(5) m(3)/s within large, continental-scale basins. The fundamental limits to meteorologic flooding depend primarily on precipitation rates and volumes, and the efficiency with which distributed rainfall concentrates into channel networks. Global and U.S. flood records show that for basins primarily affected by individual storms, the largest flows are in areas where atmospheric moisture or storm tracks are intercepted by local topographic relief. For larger basins, the largest flows result from seasonably persistent climate patterns and, on a global basis, are generally in the tropical regions where there is more precipitable moisture. Especially notable is the contribution of high-relief topography to meteorologic flooding because of its double effect of (1) lifting of atmospheric moisture, thus increasing local precipitation, and (2) promoting faster concentration of flow into channels. Floods from dam failures and terrestrial freshwater sources such as lakes and ice caps involve similar total volumes as meteorological floods, up to 10(13) m(3), but with much larger discharges-as great as 2(.)10(7) m(3)/s. The largest well-documented dam-failure floods have been during Pleistocene ice ages when glaciers and changing hydrologic conditions deranged drainage systems, causing large lakes to breach ice dams and basin divides. The largest historic floods from terrestrial water sources have had discharges as great as 1.5.10(6) m(3)/s and include floods from volcanic-induced melting of ice caps and failures of ice and landslide dams. The fundamental limits to darn-failure floods primarily arise from the size of the outlet channel and the volume of the impounded waterbody.																					0-87590-354-1				2002	5						359	385																WOS:000180349700021
J	Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Matthews, JA; Berrisford, MS				Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Matthews, JA; Berrisford, MS			A ∼4500 yr record of river floods obtained from a sediment core in Lake Atnsjoen, eastern Norway	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												To extend the historical record of river floods in southern Norway, a 572-cm long sediment core was retrieved from 42 m water depth in Atnsjoen, eastern Norway. The sediment core contains 30 light gray clastic sediment layers interpreted to have been deposited during river floods in the snow/ice free season. In the upper 123 cm of the core, four prominent flood layers occur. The youngest of these overlap with the historical record. The thickest (flood layer 5) possibly reflects a general increase in river-flood activity as a result of the post-Medieval climate deterioration (lower air temperatures, thicker and more long-lasting snow cover, and more frequent rain/snow storms) associated with the 'Little Ice Age'. The most pronounced pre-historic flood layers in the core were, according to an age model based on linear regression between eleven bulk AMS radiocarbon dates, deposited around 4135, 3770, 3635, 3470, 3345, 2690, 2595, 2455, 2415, 2255, 2230, 2150, 2120, 1870, 1815, 1665, 1640, 1480, 1400, 1380, 1290, 935, 885, 670, 655 and 435 cal. BP (BP = AD 1950). The mean return period of the river flood layers is, according to the linear regression age model, 150 +/- 30 cal. yr (mean +/- 1 S.E.).																			0921-2728					APR	2001	25	3					329	342		10.1023/A:1011197507174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011197507174													WOS:000167852600005

Ecology and distribution of fish communities seem to be directed by seasonal and diurnal oxygen level oscillations. Amazon fish have developed strategies to thrive under these varying conditions. Astronotus ocellatus normally survives large fluctuations in oxygen availability in varzea lakes. Respirometric and metabolic changes in A. ocellatus were studied during exposure to stepwise declining oxygen levels. Respiration rates were continuously recorded. Haematologic and metabolic parameters (lactate, glucose, cortisol and free fatty acids (FFA)) were determined. A. ocellatus was found to be hypoxia tolerant; it survives more than 16 h of severe hypoxia (pO(2) less than or equal to 0.4 mg l(-1)) and even 4 h of complete anoxia at 28 degrees C. Its routine metabolic rate is 10.8 mg O-2 h(-1) per 100 g fresh weight. A significant decrease in standard metabolic rate (SMR) starts at 20% air saturation, whereas a significant change of blood lactate does not start until 6% air saturation in water. We suggest therefore that A. ocellatus responses to environmental hypoxia are based mainly on suppressed metabolic rate, whereas under deep hypoxia or anoxia partial compensation is obtained from anaerobic glycolysis.

J	Mandel, RD; Laura, RM; Mitchell, MD				Mandel, Rolfe D.; Murphy, Laura R.; Mitchell, Mark D.			Geoarchaeology and paleoenvironmental context of the Beacon Island site, an Agate Basin (Paleoindian) bison kill in northwestern North Dakota, USA	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A geoarchaeological investigation that included soil-stratigraphic and paleoecological analyses was conducted at Beacon Island, located in the flood pool of Lake Sakakawea in northwestern North Dakota. Beacon Island is a multi-component archaeological site that includes an Agate Basin (Paleoindian) component consisting of the butchered remains of at least 29 Bison antiquus, along with projectile point fragments and other artifacts. The bison bonebed is a product of a single kill at ca. 10,300 B.P. and is buried in a shallow kettle basin. The basin formed around 16,000-15,000 B.P. and initially trapped loess comprising the Mallard Island Member of the Oahe Formation; other members of the Oahe Formation subsequently filled the basin. Conditions probably were relatively dry when the Mallard Island Member aggraded, but by ca. 10,300 B.P. paludal deposits comprising the Aggie Brown Member began to accumulate in the basin, indicating a shift to wetter conditions. Based on phytolith and stable carbon isotope data, cool-season C-3 prairie species dominated the site at the time of the bison kill, and the micro-mammal faunal assemblage suggests that this boreal grassland may have been punctuated by stands of shrubby vegetation. Slight warming and drying occurred soon after ca. 10,300 B.P., indicated by relatively higher delta C-13 values determined on soil organic matter and a significant increase in concentrations of microscopic particulate charcoal and drought-resistant Stipa-type phytoliths, but paludal deposits continued to aggrade, resulting in deep burial of the bonebed. Sedimentation was relatively slow in the basin, allowing soil development to keep up with deposition. This cumulization process resulted in the formation of an overthickened A horizon in the Aggie Brown Member, typical of the Leonard Paleosol. Aggradation of the Aggie Brown Member ceased by ca. 8000 B.P., and loess comprising the Pick City Member began accumulating soon after that time, likely marking the initiation of the warm, dry Altithermal climatic episode. Isotope and phytolith data also point to a warmer and probably drier climate after 8000 B.P., indicated by higher delta C-13 values and the appearance of warm-season C-4 chloridoids at the site. Hence the Agate Basin occupation coincided with the coolest and perhaps the wettest climatic episode recorded in the sampled deposits. However, it is likely that the people associated with the Agate Basin culture at Beacon Island did not experience environmental conditions dramatically different from the modern conditions at the site.

Despite the diversity of freshwater biotopes, and increasing evidence of seasonal cyanoprokaryote dominance in planktic habitats, particularly man made reservoirs, this is the first detailed study documenting the cyanoprokaryote microflora from this region. Over five thousand samples were observed from which 54 Chroococcalean species were recorded representing four families. Sampling locations included natural lakes, man made reservoirs and weir pools, rivers and streams. The majority of the taxa could be regarded as cosmopolitan, followed by tropical/ subtropical taxa and temperate taxa. The most common genera recorded included Aphanocapsa, Cyanodictyon, Myxobaktron, Merismopedia, and Microcystis. The highest taxon richness occurred in man-made lakes and reservoirs, followed by natural lakes, and streams and rivers. Fifty three taxa including three newly described species (Aphanocapsa annulata sp. nova, Gloeothece lacustris sp. nova, Gloeocapsa planctonica sp. nova) are presented including information on their morphological variability, ecology and distribution.

Daphnia pulicaria was the preferred substrate for the epibiont, whose life cycle was exclusively completed on this taxon. The density of epibiont dispersal stage and the epibiont prevalence and burden on crustacean zooplankton were directly related to D. pulicaria density in both years. Laboratory experiments showed that attached epibionts had a negative effect on Daphnia by increasing the weight and sinking rates of infected animals and a positive: effect by increasing its reproductive rates, with a neutral effect on survivorship. On the other hand, the epibiont dispersal stage was actively and intensively grazed by Daphnia, which implies a benefit for Daphnia and a cost for K. gracilipes. Thus, both species derived benefits and costs from this relationship. Our results indicate a positive cost-benefit balance for both epibiont and host in such a way that a mutualistic relationship can be suggested. This epibiont-host interaction may play an important role in population and community regulation in Rio Seco lake.

In the permanently flooded lakes (baias) of the Caracara national park Discolobium pulchellum, Mimosa pellita, Sesbania exasperata and Vigna lasiocarpa (syn. Phaseolus pilosus) were the most abundant, whereas close to Corumba, at the edges of the river Paraguai, Neptunia spp. were also common. Adaptations that allow these legumes to fix N-2 in a flooded environment included a floating growth habit, aerenchyma and nodulated adventitious roots. By contrast, Aeschynomene spp. (A. ciliata, A. denticulata, A. fluminensis, and A. sensitiva) were the dominant nodulated legumes in the seasonally flooded pastures of Nhumirim. Stem-nodulation was commonly observed, particularly on seasonally flooded Aeschynomene and seasonal/permanently flooded Discolobium spp., but also, in a modified form, on floating stems of L: lasiocarpa. The structures of stem and/or root nodules on Aeschynomene spp., Discolobium leptophyllum and V. lasiocarpa are described in detail, and nodulation by D. leptophyllum and Neptunia pubescens is reported for the first time.

J	Smits, JE; Wayland, ME; Miller, MJ; Liber, K; Trudeau, S				Smits, JE; Wayland, ME; Miller, MJ; Liber, K; Trudeau, S			Reproductive, immune, and physiological end points in tree swallows on reclaimed oil sands mine sites	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Wild nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) inhabiting reclaimed wetlands receiving tailings or water from mine tailings ponds on oil sands mine sites were the subjects in a multiyear study to determine the ecological viability of these areas. Spanning two field seasons, immune function, reproductive performance (clutch size and mass, hatching success),nestling growth and survival, and diet of tree swallows were examined on six wetlands. One aspect of immune function, the T-lymphocyte proliferative response, was assessed in vivo using a phytohemagglutinin skin test. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity provided a biomarker of exposure to oil sands contaminants in the tree swallow nestlings. Results show that there were no differences among reclaimed wetland sites for tree swallow reproductive success, nestling growth rate, and immune response that could be attributed to tailings or tailings pond water additions. Increased EROD activity confirmed the presence of xenobiotics in the diets of nestlings from two sites, while the main reference site was relatively free of EROD-inducing compounds. Dietary analyses showed that 84% of the food items of the tree swallow nestlings were of aquatic origin, likely from the local wetlands, and thus would be expected to provide a good reflection of biological effects of any mining-related contaminants accumulating through the food chain.

This research evaluated the concentrations of cadmium, lead, chromium, and nickel in liver and muscle tissues of Rutilus frisii kutum along the Caspian Sea coasts of northern Iran. Methods: Thirty samples of fishes were taken from five stations (Astara, Rezvanshahr, Anazali, Ramsar, and Tonekabon) during fishing season. An ICP-OES spectrophotometer was used to determine concentrations of the studied metals. Data was analyzed by SPSS 19 using descriptive statistical index, t test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test; P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean concentrations of cadmium, lead, chromium and nickel in the livers were 0.06, 1.1, 2.1 and 1.5 mu g/g respectively and in the muscles were 0.05, 0.8, 1.7 and 1.1 mu g/g, respectively. In liver: cadmium= 0.01-0.13; lead= 0.3-2.7; chromium = 0.9-4.5; nickel = 0.1-2.8. In muscle: cadmium = 0.01-0.08; lead = 0.2-1.5; chromium = 0.7-2.7; nickel = 0.5-1.5. Mean contents of these heavy metals were higher in the liver than in muscle. The order of heavy metal concentrations in the liver and muscle tissues were: Cr> Ni> Pb> Cd. The results showed statistically significant differences in the concentrations of these metals in liver and muscle tissues (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was observed between males and females. Conclusion: Based on calculations, the estimated permissible tolerable weekly intakes (PTWIs) of cadmium (0.042 and 0.567 mg) and lead (0.0021 and 0.027 mg) in this study are lower than the levels established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (0.455 mg for cadmium and 1.625 mg for lead).

Impact of pre-Columbian agriculture, climate change, and tectonic activity inferred from a 5,700-year paleolimnological record from Lake Nicaragua	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America, is a promising site for paleolimnological study of past climate change, tectonic and volcanic activity, and pre-Columbian agriculture in the region. It is near the northern limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which brings the rainy season to the tropics, so effects of decreasing precipitation due to southern migration of the ITCZ through the Holocene should be observable. Because fault zones and an active volcano lie within the lake, the long-term impact of tectonic and volcanic activity can also be examined. Finally, the fertile volcanic soils near the lake may have encouraged early agriculture. We analyzed diatoms, biogenic silica (BSi), total organic carbon (TOC), water content, volcanic glass, and magnetic susceptibility in a sediment core from Lake Nicaragua with eleven accelerator mass spectroscopy radiocarbon dates, spanning similar to 5,700 years. Sediment accumulation rates decreased from the bottom to the top of the core, indicating a general drying trend through the Holocene. An increase in eutrophic diatom abundance suggests that pre-Columbian agriculture impacted the lake as early as similar to 5,400 cal yr BP. Above a horizon of coarser grains deposited sometime between similar to 5,200 and 1,600 cal yr BP, planktonic diatoms increased and remained dominant to the top of the core, indicating that water depth permanently increased. Although magnetic susceptibility peaked and water content dipped at the coarse horizon, volcanic glass fragments did not increase, suggesting that the coarse horizon and subsequent increase in water depth were caused by tectonic rather than by volcanic activity. Decreased accumulation rates of BSi and TOC indicate that water became clearer when depth increased.

Hydrological processes controlling ground and surface water flow from a hypermaritime forest-peatland complex, Diana Lake Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The proposed harvesting of previously undeveloped forests in north coastal British Columbia requires an understanding of hydrological responses. Hydrometric and isotopic techniques were used to examine the hydrological linkages between meteoric inputs to the surface-groundwater system and runoff response patterns of a forest-peatland complex. Quickflow accounted for 72-91% of peak storm discharge. The runoff ratio was lowest for open peatland areas with thick organic horizons (0.02-0.05) due to low topographic gradients and many surface depressions capable of retaining surface water. Runoff ratio increased comparatively for ephemeral surface seep flows (0.06-0.40) and was greatest in steeply sloping forest communities with more permeable soils (0.33-0.69). The dominant mechanism for runoff generation was saturated shallow subsurface flow. Groundwater fluxes from the organic horizon of seeps (1.70-1.72 m(3) day(-1) m(-1)) were an important component of quickflow. The homogeneous delta H-2-delta O-18 composition of groundwater indicated attenuation of the seasonal rainfall signal by mixing during recharge. The positive correlation (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.38, alpha = 0.05) between slope index and delta O-18 values in groundwater suggests that the spatial pattern in the 8180 composition along the forest-peatland complex is influenced by topography and provides evidence that topographic indices may be used to predict groundwater residence time.

The biochemical results obtained by absorption spectroscopy and RP-HPLC with UV-detection show that pigments, and probably toxins, characteristic for cyanobacteria are preserved in the sediment. The results of this study indicate the presence in the lake of large amounts of toxic cyanobacteria that probably occurred in seasonal blooms, it seems likely that these toxic cyanobacterial blooms caused the mass death of the large mammals preserved at the Neumark-Nord locality. This model may explain comparable lithologies and vertebrate occurrences in other Tertiary lake sediments such as the Messel oil shale.																			0094-8373					WIN	2002	28	1					139	154		10.1666/0094-8373(2002)028<0139:CBATCO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373(2002)028<0139:CBATCO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174666400010

The concentration and grain-size distribution of allogenic magnetic minerals incorporated into speleothems can be used to reconstruct past hydrological regimes. We use principal component analysis of first-order reversal curves to characterise the magnetic minerals incorporated into a 33 kyr flowstone record from Aotearoa New Zealand. Three end members (EMs) represent (1) a component with a broad spectrum of grain sizes, similar to that found in the overlying soil (EM1); (2) a coarse multi-domain component, with grains ranging up to several hundred microns (EM2); and (3) a fine, single-domain to vortex component (EM3). We interpret EM1 and especially EM2 as proxies for cave stream flooding and EM3 as a proxy for soil erodibility and transport through infiltration or possibly aeolian processes. We find increased soil erodibility during the period 30-20 kyr BP, corresponding to the extended Last Glacial Maximum (eLGM). Flooding frequency is high during the periods 27-25 kyr BP and 9-0 kyr BP. eLGM flooding episodes as recorded in the flowstone may be enhanced by the deposition of the Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra, providing a rich source of magnetic material. This study shows the potential for coarse, multi-domain magnetic material incorporated in speleothems as a source of palaeoenvironmental information, especially in regions characterised by magnetiterich soils and frequent, high-energy hydrologic events.

Methane and carbon dioxide evasion from a mosaic of Amazon lakes, river channels, and inundated forests	INLAND WATERS												Seasonally inundated forests are the largest type of wetland in the Amazon basin. Here we provide new data from inundated forests, a lake, and river channels during high water in the forested Anavilhanas archipelago (Negro River, Brazil). Evasion pathways of methane (CH4) in flooded forests include tree trunks, diffusion from the water, and ebullition. Within flooded forest sites, diffusive CH4 fluxes were lowest (mean, 6.2 mu mol m-2 h-1), ebullitive fluxes averaged 50 mu mol m-2 h-1, and fluxes from the trees had the highest fluxes when expressed per inundated surface area (83 mu mol m-2 h-1). The lake and river channels usually had higher CH4 and CO2 fluxes than inundated forests. Overall, mean CH4 fluxes from inundated forests in our study were lower than fluxes measured in nutrient-rich inundated forests. Our results contribute to understanding the heterogeneity of C fluxes from inundated forests. Water levels, currents, and extent of inundated habitats contribute to variability in gas fluxes. Outgassing rates are expected to become more variable with projected periods of especially high and low water levels as the climate changes.

Empirical evidence of monsoon influences on Asian Lakes	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					International Tropical Ecology Congress	DEC 02-05, 2007	Dehradun, INDIA					Limited information is available on how the Asian monsoon influences contemporary lake processes, seasonal patterns and interannual variation. Data sets from Nepal (Indian monsoon region) and South Korea (East Asian monsoon region) along with published literature show a wide range in the response of Asian lakes to the seasonal monsoon. Cross-system patterns show nutrients and algal biomass peak in most lakes in response to monsoon inflow, which suggests nonpoint sources dominate external loading. This seasonal increase may be the general phenological model for nutrients and phytoplankton in lakes in monsoon regions. Major ions show dilution by surface runoff during the monsoon and post-monsoon increases. Dilution of nutrients in fertile systems during the monsoon suggests point source inputs dominate peak loads during the non-monsoon period. Peak monsoon runoff can enter the water column of large stratified lakes as a density-dependent interflow at depth in the water column with little direct influence on the mixed layer. In these water bodies nutrients in surface water can be lower during strong monsoon seasons because of sub-surface loading. Short-interval data from individual lakes show the linkage between nutrients and phytoplankton biomass can be uncoupled by physical processes and light limitation, resulting in considerable temporal variation. Collectively these mixed responses limit our ability to generalize patterns or predict conditions in individual lakes during the monsoon.

Water quality assessment of coastal Caloosahatchee River watershed, Florida	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Caloosahatchee River watershed and estuary has experienced a general decline in the water quality over the last several decades due to agriculture practices, development, and other human activities. The objective of this study is to assess the water quality condition in coastal Caloosahatchee River watershed by analyzing the data collected by South Florida Water Management District and Lee County. Results indicated that during 1995 to 2006, averaged annually, Lake Okeechobee released 1124 million m(3) of freshwater into the Caloosahatchee River, whereas the average annual freshwater discharge out of the Caloosahatchee River was approximately 2277 million m(3). Lake Okeechobee might have more impacts on the water quality condition of Caloosahatchee River in dry season than wet season. The loads ratios of Lake Okeechobee to those out of Caloosahatchee River were much higher in dry season than wet season for flow (72% to 36%), total phosphorus (63% to 20%), total nitrogen (72% to 41%), organic nitrogen (85% to 47%), and NH3 (78% to 39%).

Status and management of noble crayfish Astacus astacus in Estonia	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Noble crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) is an indigenous and the only crayfish species in Estonia. It is potentially endangered by invasion of alien species, diseases and habitat deterioration but does not have legal protected status and is fished only for recreational purpose. Crayfish Working Group of Ministry of Environment and Department of Aquaculture of the Estonian University of Life Sciences have developed crayfish conservation and management plan. Since 1994 standardized test fishing with traps (which catch only crayfish over 7 cm TL) has been carried out and database of these fishings shows, that crayfish is dwelling in more than 255 sites in the lakes, rivers, streams, artificial reservoirs. In 52% of monitored sites populations are weak, catch per trap night is below 1 specimen. Exceptionally rich is the stock on the island Saaremaa, where in 59% of populations catch per trap night is over 4 and can reach 50. Licensed recreational catch is allowed in regions, where monitoring data show good status of crayfish stock. It is not allowed to sell the crayfish caught on recreational license. Crayfishing season is limited with August, size limit in recreational fishery is 11 cm TL. There are 10 operating crayfish farms and 15 are under construction. The farms produce yearly around 1000 kg of commercial size crayfish for export to Finland. Over 200 000 juveniles are produced for restocking yearly. Restocking projects e. g. restoration of populations, which have been lost because of plague have been successful. The main threat factor is crayfish plague. In 2006-2007 it destroyed the stock of crayfish farms of companies Veteko, Pahkla, Astacus and wild population of Poduste river on the island Saaremaa.																			1961-9502						2009		394-95							18	10.1051/kmae/2010012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2010012													WOS:000280166500018

Diversity of sulfur cycling halophiles within the Salton Sea, California's largest lake	BMC MICROBIOLOGY												BackgroundMicroorganisms are the biotic foundation for nutrient cycling across ecosystems, and their assembly is often based on the nutrient availability of their environment. Though previous research has explored the seasonal lake turnover and geochemical cycling within the Salton Sea, California's largest lake, the microbial community of this declining ecosystem has been largely overlooked. We collected seawater from a single location within the Salton Sea at 0 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m, 7 m, 9 m, 10 m, and 10.5 m depths in August 2021, December 2021, and April 2022.ResultsWe observed that the water column microbiome significantly varied by season (R2 = 0.59, P = 0.003). Temperature (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.004), dissolved organic matter (R2 = 0.13, P = 0.004), and dissolved oxygen (R2 = 0.089, P = 0.004) were significant drivers of seasonal changes in microbial composition. In addition, several halophilic mixotrophs and other extremotolerant bacteria were consistently identified in samples across depths and time points, though their relative abundances fluctuated by season. We found that while sulfur cycling genes were present in all metagenomes, their relative coverages fluctuated by pathway and season throughout the water column. Sulfur oxidation and incomplete sulfur oxidation pathways were conserved in the microbiome across seasons.ConclusionsOur work demonstrates that the microbiome within the Salton Seawater has the capacity to metabolize sulfur species and utilize multiple trophic strategies, such as alternating between chemorganotrophy and chemolithoautrophy, to survive this harsh, fluctuating environment. Together, these results suggest that the Salton Sea microbiome is integral in the geochemical cycling of this ever-changing ecosystem and thus contributes to the seasonal dynamics of the Salton Sea. Further work is required to understand how these environmental bacteria are implicated relationship between the Salton Sea's sulfur cycle, dust proliferation, and respiratory distress experienced by the local population.

Spatial and temporal variability of dust flux in Sistan and its response to climate and vegetation controls	CATENA												Airborne dust being advected at ground level displays great spatial and temporal variation due to differences in vegetation cover and soil conditions at the emission source, changes in wind speed, and relative distances to source. This study evaluates the temporal and spatial variations of dust flux and its drivers through a rare 18month long field monitoring campaign, from June 2022 through October 2023, across five sites downwind of lakebed dust sources ('Hamouns') in the Sistan region of Eastern Iran. By examining the relationship between aeolian dust flux and meteorological parameters (precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) and vegetation cover we were able to identify the impacts of meteorological factors and vegetation cover on regional dust flux variations. Results indicate significant differences between fluxes at the five different sites, and highest correlations with dust storm index (DSI) and number of dust storm days (DSD) recorded at one central meteorological station. Annual variations in regional dust flux are explained by differences in vegetation cover over the lakebed source areas, recorded by NDVI from satellite imagery, between the dusty seasons of 2022 and 2023, while distance from source impacts the regional variations. The mapping of regional dust flux variations allows identifying dust-hazardous areas in Sistan and the most effective mitigation measures. The highest monhtly dust flux was measured in Ghorghori (144.32 g cm-2) and the lowest in Zabol (15.7 g cm-2), suggesting that efforts to stabilize the upwind sources in Ghorghori should be prioritized.					; Baas, Andreas/C-2683-2013	Baas, Andreas/0000-0001-9305-5868; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN 1	2025	253								108880	10.1016/j.catena.2025.108880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2025.108880		MAR 2025											WOS:001442652200001

This study aims were to investigate their age, growth, and recruitment pattern, through a sampling that was performed monthly, from November 2017 to August 2018. The individual fish was measured for length and weight, and sex was determined. The otoliths were collected, cleaned, and placed on molds to pour epoxy resin. The otoliths were cut to obtain slices and observed under a microscope at 100xmagnification. Subsequently, the age was determined by counting the number of daily rings. It was established that the snakehead spawned every month, with a comparably higher frequency in the new moon than in other phases, and mostly were 3-10 months old, characterized by bigger and older sizes during the rainy season. Furthermore, the average growth rate was observed to be faster during the rainy season in contrast with the dry season. Hence, the parameters of von Bertalanffy growth functions were estimated by back-calculated length, and the pattern in female was Lt=56.09 (1 - e(- 0.81 (t + 0.07))), while male Lt=59.36 (1 - e(- 0.71 (t + 0.09))), and total Lt=60.32 (1 - e(- 0.71 (t + 0.14))), respectively.					; Djumanto, Djumanto/AFA-5419-2022; Setyobudi, Eko/GPP-2133-2022; Simanjuntak, Charles P H/AAD-3210-2022	Djumanto, Djumanto/0000-0001-8694-6224; Simanjuntak, Charles P H/0000-0002-7673-0435; 													2045-2322					NOV 16	2020	10	1							19830	10.1038/s41598-020-76825-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76825-5								33199735					WOS:000595259200002

Several factors, such as environmental concentrations (i.e. in sediment) and physiological characteristics of organisms determine species-specific accumulation patterns of POPs in marine animal tissue. The present study investigated factors that govern species-specific accumulation patterns of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in a food web from Sydney Estuary (Australia). The results indicated that physiological characteristics, i.e. lipid %, spatial, i.e. distance from Homebush Bay (point source of POPs) and life history characteristics of the organisms, such as diet and home range, influence PCDD/F and dl-PCB tissue concentrations to a varying degree. For example, PCDD/F tissue concentrations increased with the presence of detritivorous diet, species with limited home range and close proximity to Homebush Bay. On the other hand, lipid %, piscivorous diet and close proximity to Homebush Bay were the main predictors causing increases in dl-PCB tissue levels. Distance from Homebush Bay was the only predictor affecting both PCDD/F and dl-PCB tissue levels at a similar rate, i.e. decreasing tissue concentrations as the distance increases from Homebush Bay.

J	Coletta, P; Pentecosta, A; Spiro, B				Coletta, P; Pentecosta, A; Spiro, B			Stable isotopes in charophyte incrustations: relationships with climate and water chemistry	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Age gradients of stable C and O isotopes were found in modem Chara hispida calcite incrustations allowing seasonal changes in water chemistry to be observed. Gradients resulted from apical calcification in growing charophytes. In a regional study of 12 species and varieties of charophytes the carbonate delta C-13 differed significantly with 'low value' and 'high value' species such as Chara globularis and C baltica, respectively. Samples from lakes and other stagnant waters had significantly higher delta C-13 values than those sampled from flowing water. The differences were related mainly to photosynthesis. Charophyte delta O-18 (carbonate) was not significantly different between species but water chemistry was important for brackish water Lamprothamnium papulosum. The overall delta O-18 (carbonate) was positively correlated with groundwater delta O-18 and it is suggested that more reliable environmental information is available from delta O-18 than delta O-18 in charophyte marls. The mean charophyte carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18 was -5.7 parts per thousand and -6.4 parts per thousand VPDB, respectively. Environmental temperature estimates suggested that at some sites the carbonate was deposited close to isotopic equilibrium, but in others a slight to moderate disequilibrium was indicated.

At the reservoirs, mostly those in semi-arid regions, water level then fluctuates extremely between rises and downward during one single year. Besides of water management implications, changes on physical, chemical and biological dynamics of these drawdown and refilling are little known yet. This paper shows the results, throughout a year, on solids, nutrients (N and P), chlorophyll-a, and sedimentation changes on the dynamics, when the former policy was applied in a reservoir from the semi-arid Northwestern Mexico. Water level sinusoidal trend impinged changes on thermal stratification and mixing, modifying nutrient cycling and primary producer responses. According to nitrogen and phosphorus concentration as well as chlorophyll-a, reservoir was mesotrophic, becoming hypertrophic during drawdown. Nutrient concentrations were high (1.22 +/- 0.70 and 0.14 +/- 0.12 mg P l(-1)), increasing phosphorus and lowering N:P significantly throughout the study period, although no intensive agricultural, no urban development, neither industrial activities take place in the watershed. This suggests nutrient recycling complex mechanisms, including nutrient release from the sediment-water interface as the main nutrient pathway when shallowness, at the same time as mineralization, increases. Outflows controlled nitrogen and phosphorus availability on the ecosystem while organic matter depended on river inflows. As on other subtropical aquatic ecosystems, nitrogen limited primary productivity (Spearman correlation R = 0.75) but chlorophyll-a seasonal pattern showed an irregular trend, prompting other no-nutrient related limitants. Shallowness induced a homogeneous temporal pattern on water quality. This observed temporal variability was mainly explained statistically by changes on solids (mineral and organic), chlorophyll-a and flows (62.3%). Annual sedimentation rates of total solids ranged from 11.73 to 16.29 kg m(-2) year(-1) with organic matter comprising around 30%. N:P ratio on sedimentation rates were as high as could be expected in a resuspension dominated ecosystem, and spatially inverse related with N:P ratio on bottom sediments. Distance from river inlet into the reservoir reveals a marked spatial heterogeneity on solid and nitrogen sedimentation, showing the system dependence on river inflows and supporting resuspension as the main phosphorus pathway. Accretion rates (2.19 +/- 0.40 cm year(-1)) were not related to hydrological variability but decreased with the distance to the river input. Total sediment accumulation (9,895 tons km(-2) year(-1)) denotes siltation as other serious environmental problem in reservoirs but possibly not related with operational procedures.					; Sanchez-Carrillo, Salvador/L-1098-2014	SANCHEZ-CARRILLO, SALVADOR/0000-0002-5471-977X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2007	132	1-3					377	393		10.1007/s10661-006-9541-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9541-x								17171240					WOS:000248624700029

A linear/non-linear hybrid time-series model to investigate the depletion of inland water bodies	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Changing climate and human interference with natural phenomena are causing unprecedented changing patterns in hydro-climatic variables. These changes can manifest as dynamic changes of the stochastic properties of the datasets over time, which pose challenges for conventional time-series modeling. These datasets are dynamic in nature, even when trend and seasonality components are eliminated. Shrinking lakes are among the most notable examples of hydro-climatic-driven phenomena. This study demonstrates a framework that can capture the underlying dynamic and non-stationary structure of such environments using a case study of Maharlou Lake, Iran. To that end, a hybrid time-series model was developed to account for volatility in the data [i.e., SARIMA (1,1,2) x (1,1,2)(12)/GARCH(1,0)]. A series of statistical tests (i.e., augmented Dickey-Fuller test, the Ljung-Box test, the heteroskedasticity test, and the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were used to create, calibrate, and assess the model in the 95% confidence interval. The results indicate the decline and depletion of the lake. This reduction manifests as a general downward trend and a widening gap between the lake's intra-annual fluctuations. The changes could be an alarming signal, as this saline lake could be mimicking the tragic fate of similar inland water bodies like Lake Urmia or the Aral Sea.

The red beds formed in Triassic to Lower Jurassic times during rifting of the North American and African plates. Detailed stratigraphic work revealed asymmetrical, metre-scale cycles in mudstone-dominated successions that constitute the intermediate and upper portion of the basin hh. Sedimentary cycles commonly comprise ephemeral lake shales at the base, playa mudflat mudstones in the intermediate part, and both fluvial and aeolian sandstones at the top. Cycles of the Aglegal Member (T4) are mainly characterized by analcime-rich playa mudflat deposits displaying features indicative of palaeo-Vertisols. Cycles of the Sidi Mansour (T7) and Hasseine (T8) Members are represented by ephemeral lake or dry playa mudflat deposits grading into saline mudflat mudstones that are overlain by sheet flow and minor aeolian sandstones. Sedimentary cycles of the Imerhrane Member (T9) comprise sheet delta sandstones at the base overlain by ephemeral lake and dry playa mudflat mudstones. Upper cycle portions consist of aeolian dune and sand sheet sandstones. Cyclicity is attributed to palaeoclimatic and associated palaeohydrological fluctuations, probably within the Milankovitch frequency band. Sedimentary facies of each cycle provide evidence for a gradual climatic drying with time. The asymmetrical drying-upward cycles possibly record the precession cycle, since they are modulated by symmetrical (i.e., oscillating drying/wetting) cycles of a lower frequency indicative of eccentricity. A long-term change in palaeoclimate ranging from semi-arid conditions with seasonal precipitation (T4) towards an arid, non-seasonal climate (T8) is preserved within the cyclical units spanning a time interval of several million years. Individual cycles can be traced laterally for tens of kilometres. Correlative sections are almost identical in thickness, suggesting a phase of tectonic quiescence during their deposition. Sediment accumulation was not restricted to small-scale grabens, but took place continuously throughout the exposed area of the Argana Valley, implying that accommodation space has not been controlled by syndepositional tectonism.

This study quantified 16 priority PAHs in sediments from an urbanized river and its tributaries using gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, assessing the impact of local light industries. The total sedimentary PAH concentrations ranged from 244 to 24,616 ng/g dw (mean: 2097 +/- 2673 ng/g dw), with high molecular weight PAHs predominating. PAH concentrations closely mirrored the operational footprint of the textile and shipping industries, including significantly higher PAH concentrations in the midstream compared to the upstream and downstream areas with fewer industrial activities. Additionally, PAH concentrations were significantly higher in the rainy season in the semi-closed lakes than in the dry season and normal season, likely due to increased industrial production and shipping activity, combined with the periodical closure of sluice gates that restricts the outflow of PAHs from connected lakes to the main watercourse. Multiple statistical analyses revealed that coal and petroleum combustions, primarily from these local industries, contributed 88% to the sedimentary PAH load, while vehicle exhausts and oil leakages accounted for the remaining 12%. According to sediment quality guidelines, PAHs exhibited pervasive ecological risks, even near drinking water sources. This study highlights the substantial influence of industrial activities on PAH distribution in urbanized rivers and provides a robust theoretical foundation for energy transition and drinking water protection strategies.					; Chen, chunzhao/HDM-1271-2022; Huang, Qinghui/E-5157-2011	Huang, Qinghui/0000-0001-5770-6694; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				APR	2025	378								124737	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124737		MAR 2025						40031416					WOS:001439061500001

We investigated as to how nutrients and other environmental variables influenced the biomass of Dinophyceae species in three subtropical ecosystems. The reservoirs Samuara, Faxinal, and So Miguel were sampled fortnightly from 2002 to 2006, and eight dinoflagellate taxa were identified. High temperature was a determining factor for the occurrence of Peridinium africanum Lemmermann. Peridinium umbonatum Stein and P. willei Huitfeld-Kass required high concentrations of nutrients. P. willei was inversely related to temperature and directly related to nutrients. P. umbonatum Stein var. umbonatum Stein showed the largest range of tolerance toward resources. Durinskia baltica Carty & Cox and Peridinium gatunense Nygaard could be opportunistic, since they did not show any spatial or temporal pattern.

Variations in otolith patterns, sizes and body morphometrics of jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus juveniles	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Variations in otolith patterns, sizes and body morphometrics of jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus juveniles were investigated. Under transmitted light, translucent (W-t) and opaque otoliths (W-o) were detected in juveniles collected from Wakasa Bay between July 2005 and April 2006, whereas only opaque otoliths (G(o)) were detected in Goto-nada Sea individuals between May and June 2006. Three groups of juveniles were distinguished based on differences in hatch season, otolith size and growth history, and body morphometrics. As T. japonicus has different spawning seasons according to spawning grounds, each group was estimated to hatch in different waters. Juveniles with W-t otoliths were considered to have stayed in coastal habitat longer, as the hatch area was estimated to be near Wakasa Bay. Juveniles with W-o and G(o) otoliths appear to recruit to coastal waters at larger size, since their hatch areas were estimated to be far from each collection area. Larger otoliths of W-t were attributed to otolith accretion after the second growth flexion, which was observed only for W-t. Standard length of W-t fish at the second otolith growth flexion was estimated to correspond to recruitment size to coastal rocky reefs in Wakasa Bay. Body morphometrics were correlated with otolith size after removing body size effect, suggesting that morphological variations of T. japonicus juveniles were also associated with the timing of recruitment to coastal habitat.					; YU, KANAJI/AAY-1286-2021; Yamashita, Yoh/IYJ-3507-2023; Kanaji, Yu/AAY-1286-2021	Kawamura, Tomohiko/0009-0008-0086-7428; Kanaji, Yu/0000-0001-6954-6261													0022-1112	1095-8649				OCT	2010	77	6					1325	1342		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02752.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02752.x								21039508					WOS:000282875100010

New and regenerated primary production in a productive reservoir ecosystem	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The concept of new and regenerated production has been used extensively in marine ecosystems but rarely in freshwaters. We assessed the relative importance of new and regenerated phosphorus (P) in sustaining phytoplankton production in Acton Lake, a eutrophic reservoir located in southwestern Ohio, USA. Sources of nutrients to the euphotic zone, including watershed loading, fluxes from sediments, and excretion by sediment-feeding Fish (gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum), were considered sources of new P input that support new primary production and were quantified over the course of a growing season. Regenerated production was estimated by the difference between new and total primary production. New production represented 32%-53% of total primary production, whereas regenerated production represented 47%-68% of total primary production. P excretion by gizzard shad supplied 45%-74% of new P and 24% of P required for total production. In summary, fluxes or P from the watershed and those from sediment-feeding fish need to be considered in strategies to reduce eutrophication in reservoir ecosystems.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2010	67	2					278	287		10.1139/F09-182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-182													WOS:000274352400006

Growing season data were log (base e) transformed and averaged by lake and year. We compared regressions of InTP and InTN on InChla based on aggregations of the 9 levels of "Lake Type", the classification scheme of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE), to a new classification scheme identified by the Bayesian TREED regression algorithm that partitioned the data based on geographic, morphometric and chemical properties of the lakes. The classifier identified with the BTREED algorithm had the best resulting model fit as measured by several different metrics. The model identified by the BTREED procedure that was allowed to use the suite of geographic, morphometric and chemical classifiers selected only the morphometric variable mean lake depth as the basis of the classification scheme. This model resulted in separate classes for shallow (<2.6 m), medium (2.6 m < mean depth < 16.3 m) and deep (>16.3 m) lakes corresponding to co-control by N and P (shallow and medium depths) and N-control (deep lakes) of algal productivity as measured by chlorophyll a, as indicated by the regression coefficients for each partition on depth. However, TN:TP ratios indicate clear P limitation in each depth class. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sáez, A; Cabrera, L				Sáez, A; Cabrera, L			Sedimentological and palaeohydrological responses to tectonics and climate in a small, closed, lacustrine system:: Oligocene As Pontes Basin (Spain)	SEDIMENTOLOGY												A small, closed, lacustrine system developed during the restraining overstep stages of the Oligocene As Pontes strike-slip basin (Spain). The increase in basin accommodation and the headward spread of the drainage, which increased the water input, triggered a change from shallow, holomictic to deeper, meromictic conditions. The lower, shallow, lacustrine assemblage consists of mudstone-carbonate cycles recording lacustrine-palustrine ramp deposition in a saline lake. High Sr content in some early diagenetic calcites suggests that aragonite and calcite made up the primary carbonate muds. Early dolomitization took place together with widespread pedogenic activity. The upper, deep, freshwater, lacustrine assemblage includes bundles of carbonate-clay rhythmites and fine-grained turbidite beds. Primary calcite and diagenetic siderite make up the carbonate laminae. The Mg content of the primary carbonates records variations in Mg/Ca ratios in lacustrine waters. delta(18)O and delta(13)C covariance trends in calcite reinforce closed drainage conditions. delta(18)O data indicate that the lake system changed rapidly from short-lived isotopically light periods (i.e. from seasonal to pluriannual) to longer steady-state periods of heavier delta(18)O (i.e. from pluriannual to millennial). The small delta(13)C changes in the covariant trends were caused by dilute inflow, changing the contributions of dissolved organic carbon in the system and/or internal variations in lacustrine organic productivity and recycling. In both shallow and deep carbonate facies, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis may account, respectively, for the larger negative and positive delta(13)C shifts recorded in the early diagenetic carbonates (calcite, dolomite and siderite). The lacustrine system was very susceptible to high-frequency, climatically forced water balance variations. These climatic oscillations interfered with the low-frequency tectonic and morphological changes in the basin catchment. This resulted in the superposition of high-order depositional, mineralogical and geochemical cycles and rhythms on the lower order lacustrine infill sequence.

J	Britten, MW; Kennedy, PL; Ambrose, S				Britten, MW; Kennedy, PL; Ambrose, S			Performance and accuracy evaluation of small satellite transmitters	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Recent technological advances have resulted in small (30 g) satellite platform transmitter terminals (PTTs) that can be used to track animals with masses as little as 900-1,000 g. While larger PTTs (>80 g) often yield locations accurate to within hundreds of meters, the location accuracy of smaller PTTs has not been tested. We did these tests while using the PTTs to document migration routes and nonbreeding areas of American peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus anatum). We PTT-tagged 42 female peregrines from 2 breeding areas (upper Yukon River in eastcentral Alaska and Lake Powell on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah and northern Arizona) late in the breeding seasons of 1993-95. Only 2 of the PTTs failed prematurely (4.7% failure rate). Active PTTs (i.e., PTTs on live birds that eventually stopped transmitting due to battery exhaustion) averaged 280 transmission hours for 1993-94 (n = 3), 380 transmission hours for 1994-95 (n = 7), and 430 transmission hours for 1995-96 (n = 15). Using an estimate of maximum ground speed of peregrines (104 km/hr) based on empirical observations and aerodynamic calculations, we determined that 4.48% of all locations provided to us by Argos (n = 2,323) were biologically implausible. We also received many poor-quality locations (68% of records were in Argos location classes 0, A, and B) typical of small, relatively underpowered PTTs. To estimate location accuracy of these poor-quality locations, we compared Argos-estimated locations with known locations of 11 rock doves (Columba livia) tagged with PTTs. The location types with the highest precision averaged 4 km from the true location, while the location types with the lowest precision averaged 35 km from the true location. These results indicate the PTT locations were sufficient to document animal movements over broad spatial scales such as identifying migration routes and nonbreeding areas of birds. This technology is more efficient and less biased than the current approaches used to obtain this information (mark-resighting of banded animals or standard radiotelemetry techniques). However, the PTTs currently available are not suitable when position accuracy <35 km is needed.

J	WETZEL, RG				WETZEL, RG			DEATH, DETRITUS, AND ENERGY-FLOW IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pelagic trophic structure and energy fluxes are evaluated predominantly on the basis of ingestion of particulate organic matter by living organisms and the effects of consumption on the population dynamics of trophic levels. 2. Population fluxes are not representative of the-material and energy fluxes of either the composite pelagic region or the lake ecosystem. Metabolism of particulate and especially dissolved organic detritus from many pelagic and non-pelagic autochthonous and from allochthonous sources dominates both material and energy fluxes. Because of the very large magnitudes and relative chemical recalcitrance of these detrital sources, the large but slow metabolism of detritus provides an inherent ecosystem stability that energetically dampens the ephemeral, volatile fluctuations of higher trophic levels. 3.

J	Mamun, M; Yang, X				Mamun, Md; Yang, Xiao			Advancing lakes algal chlorophyll estimation in the contiguous USA: A comparative study of machine learning models and satellite data	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Algal blooms are ubiquitous in lentic ecosystems and pose a risk to human and other organisms' health. Accurate measurement of chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) in lakes at a macroscale is challenging due to the optical complexity of individual water bodies, which hinders the optimization of conventional bio-optical algorithms. This study harnesses the synergy of satellite remote sensing and machine learning (ML) to enhance CHL-a quantification from space. Given the cost and logistical demands of in-situ CHL-a data collection, especially over vast areas, we explore the potential of the open-source AquaSat dataset for CHL-a estimation across the contiguous USA. We assess the performance of four ML algorithms (random forest, extra tree regressor, bagging regressor, and xgboost model), discern the most influential spectral bands and indices, and compare these methods to established remote sensing techniques for CHL-a prediction. Both bagging regressor and random forest performed equally well on all AquaSat data or data from each sensor separately (R2 = 0.35-0.54, RMSE = 20.48-23.90 mu g/ L). Model-agnostic SHAP summary plots were used to identify important indexes in CHL-a estimation. Spatiotemporal validations demonstrated the models' reliability across diverse conditions, with better generalizability in spatial domains compared to seasonal or yearly transitions. The accuracy of algorithms for estimating CHL-a depends on the satellite sensor. We found that by comparing remote sensing studies with various atmospheric correction approaches, the Landsat collection 1 (LC1) surface reflectance product offers consistent CHL-a estimates throughout the USA. Overall, acknowledging the existing limitations and challenges of such approaches, this research illustrates the potential of utilizing open-source data with ML to facilitate large-scale estimation of lake CHL-a.

One of the important consequences was cessation of peat formation in tropical Pangea - an underexplored issue because successions of this age in major European coalfields are either not preserved or are stratigraphically poorly constrained. The about 1 km thick Line Formation (upper Gzhelian-lower Asselian) of Bohemian basins dominated by fluvial and alluvial red-beds interbedded by grayish lacustrine deposits records similar to 3.5 Myr long tectono-sedimentary, climatic and biotic history already calibrated by TIMS ages to the Pennsylvanian-Permian transition. By integrating outcrop- and basins-scale data on sedimentary facies as well as on terrestrial biota, this paper evaluates the effects of climate and of post-orogenic tectonic processes on resulting depositional and biotic records and their effect on peat accretion. The current data indicate that the climate oscillated in about 450 kyr scale between less and more seasonal. During the Late Pennsylvanian, minimum seasonality (max. humidity) supported presence of 'wet fluvial systems' and meromictic lake formation lined with rheotrophic peat swamps, whereas during the driest climate (max. seasonality), well-drained fluvial landscape dominated the basin lowland. During the Early Permian, well-drained fluvial/small shallow lake habitats ('dry fluvial systems') prevailed due to long-term aridification trend in tropical Pangea, and wetland - dryland biomes coexisted over most of the time in a preservation window of the basin lowland and/or adjacent upland habitats. Their proportion, however, varied significantly in accord with climatic oscillations. The Line Fm. was deposited in a half-graben basin system formed in response to post-Variscan intra-plate extension. The basin filling reflected three 'rift phases': (1) initiation, with localized subsidence and opening of initial sub-basins; (2) climax, with more distributed, maximum subsidence and interconnecting of sub-basins to form extensive basin system; (3) waning, likely dominated by thermal subsidence. Formation of major, basinwide Klobuky Lake was facilitated by wet period ocurring during the rift climax stage with the most rapid creation of the accommodation space. Peat swamps formed and the peat accreted only during the late Gzhelian up to TIMS calibrated C-P boundary. Increasing aridification, however, constrained peat swamps from floodplain to shallowed lakes, the water table of which suffered less from seasonal oscillations comparing to floodplain areas. Purely rheotrophic, usually high-ash peat swamps formed. The peat-swamp development was often interrupted by temporary rise of lake level and influx of clastic material. Resulting coal beds are usually few tens of centimeters thick, and if thicker, they commonly contain clastic partings or high-ash coal intervals. Peat-swamp vegetation is dominated by free-sporing plants, mainly ferns and sphenophytes, however, present are also lepidodendrid lycopsids. Since the beginning of the Permian, the aridification trend already did not support long-term and widespread peat accretion and the absence of economic coal beds is in agreement with replacement of meromictic lakes by shallow well-oxygenated small lakes, increased proportion of red-beds and apparent reduction of wetland flora. Instead, drier habitats supported dryland biome dominated by walchian conifers and probably also by pteridosperms of peltaspermalean affinity.

The role of pheromones and temporal mechanisms in the reproductive isolation of Monochamus maculosus, Monochamus notatus, and Monochamus scutellatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The mechanisms used to facilitate mate location among insects-such as pheromones-can inhibit interspecific attraction and confer reproductive isolation. However, pheromone components seem conserved within the genus Monochamus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) with the compound 2-(undecyloxy)ethanol (referred to as monochamol) being identified as the sex-aggregation pheromone or putative pheromone attractant for at least 15 species in this genus. This pheromone parsimony suggests the existence of additional isolating mechanisms. Here we describe the results of laboratory and field assays of additional mechanisms, including laboratory volatile collections and field trapping experiments that assessed the potential presence of additional pheromone components, diel rhythms of pheromone production, and phenological/diel flight activity in the reproductive isolation of sympatric populations of three species of Monochamus in the Great Lakes Forest Region of Ontario, Canada. Chemical analyses of volatile extractions indicate that monochamol is produced by male Monochamus maculosus and Monochamus scutellatus, but no qualitative differences were observed in male extracts of these two species suggesting that there are no additional pheromone components that confer specificity. No quantitative differences were found in the production of monochamol by male M. scutellatus during the photophase and scotophase suggesting there is no diel rhythm in pheromone production. Our results indicate that M. scutellatus flies earlier in the season and day than M. maculosus and Monochamus notatus, which could partially contribute to their reproductive isolation. Overall, no obvious differences in pheromone composition were observed but minor differences in flight times were observed, suggesting other isolating mechanisms may exist.					; Allison, Jeremy/AAQ-1461-2020	Smith, Sandy M/0000-0003-1670-9586; McTavish, Michael/0000-0002-3343-8709													0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	2025	54	2					233	242		10.1093/ee/nvaf017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaf017		FEB 2025						40036303					WOS:001436195000001

A large proportion (> 80%) of the annual input to the lake occurred in the December to March rainy season. During this period, biogenic Si (BSi) made up 61 % of Si input from rivers. Microscopic examination indicated that a large fraction of BSi was phytoliths, which likely originated from cultivated maize and terrestrial grasses. Over an annual cycle, river input made up approximately 25% of total Si input to the epilimnion, while 75% resulted from vertical exchange with Si-rich deep water. Due to its long hydraulic residence time, Lake Malawi retains nearly all of the Si that enters it. Despite high temperatures, a relatively high proportion (7 to 11%) of diatom production is permanently buried. A Si flux model is used to demonstrate that river discharge and vertical mixing can have similar effects on BSi burial rate over short time scales (one to two decades), but very different effects over longer time periods. This temporally dependent response must be taken into account when interpreting sediment records.

J	Zaw, M; Chiswell, B				Zaw, M; Chiswell, B			Iron and manganese dynamics in lake water	WATER RESEARCH												The speciation and fractionation of iron and manganese compounds from Hinze Dam water samples (Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia) were studied using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPRS), gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration and various acid digestion regimes. Samples were taken at various depths and times of year, and both filtrate and particulate samples of water column profiles and sediment samples were analysed. Relevant water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, true colour, turbidity, conductivity and alkalinity were also measured. Following heavy rainfall, dirty water and associated water treatment problems increased as catchment surface erosion and dynamic mixing of the whole water column induced by the introduction of a large volume of rainwater runoff lead to marked increases in particulate matter (mainly carbonates) in the water body. The res;lts obtained before and during artificial aeration were compared at different depths and times of year. Artificial aeration had an initial marked reduction in the levels of soluble iron and manganese in all the dam profiles, however, the concentrations of these metals showed a steady increase over the succeeding years. Statistical analysis of data has been undertaken to correlate the changes between the various forms of iron and manganese with the advent of artificial aeration. Such analyses indicate that a number of traditionally measured water quality parameters have no long-term value for predicting the likely levels of soluble and insoluble iron and manganese, even when correlations between the parameters are calculated on a seasonal rather than on a yearly basis. These water quality parameters are not measured solely for the purpose of prediction, nevertheless, the parameters may be important for real-time treatment process control and for general water resource management. Some important implications for water resource management and water treatment processes are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The integrated electrochemical device is composed of an office paper-based sensor combined with a customized 3D printing cube-shaped holder used for the extraction of phosphorus from sediment samples. The extracted phosphorus was trapped on a filter pad placed over the sensor and preloaded with acidic ammonium molybdate, allowing for the formation of the phosphomolybdate complex, which is electroactive. The use of carbon black as a nanomodifier of office paper-based electrode together with square wave voltammetry enabled the detection of phosphorus with a detection limit of 0.011 ppm within a broad linear range of 0.039-20 ppm. Furthermore, this sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity towards phosphate ions among the several ions studied, namely NO3-, NO2-, F-, SO42-, CH3COO-, Cl-, CO23-, Mg2+, K+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Na+, Cu2+, and Ni2+. The precision of the analytical platform was evaluated using eight distinct sensors, yielding a relative standard deviation below 5 %. The reliability of the paper-based integrated sensor was assessed by determining phosphorus levels in sediment samples obtained from various seasonal shallow coastal lakes situated in Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica, by comparing the data obtained with both the novel printed integrated device and the colorimetric reference method. The agreement of the data with a coefficient of correlation equal to 0.86 (r = 0.86) demonstrated the great potential of the developed sensing tool for use in real-world applications.

A total of 389 specimens of Capoeta were examined for Allocreadium isoporum infections throughout the four different seasons of 2012. The prevalence and mean intensity of infection of A. isoporum was investigated in relation to the host species, the seasons across the year, host size, and sex. Two-hundred and twenty-two specimens of a trematode identified as A. isoporum were found in these fishes. One-hundred seventy-eight C. angorae were caught, and 70 A. isoporum were recorded in 8 of 178 fish examined, with prevalence and mean intensity of infection of 4.49% and 8.7% parasites per infected fish, respectively. In the 112 specimens of C. antalyensis, 73 individuals of A. isoporum were found, with a prevalence of 19.6% and a mean intensity of 3.3. As for the infection in C. caelestis, a total of 79 specimens of A. isoporum were found in 17 of the 99 fish examined, with prevalence and mean intensity of infection of 17.1% and 4.6%, respectively. Prevalence and mean intensity values in relation to host size and sex, as well as the seasonality of infections was analyzed and the results were compared with other studies.

Reduced vitamin A (retinol) levels indicate radionuclide exposure in Streaked Shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 released significant amounts of radionuclides into the marine environment. Exposure to radiation reduces levels of antioxidants such as carotenoids and vitamins A and E within exposed individuals. Such reductions can cause teratogenic or mutagenetic effects leading to reduced reproductive viability and fitness. Reduced antioxidant levels therefore may be used as an indicator of radionuclide contamination and to infer individual or population level impacts; however, the taxa-specific responses of marine organisms, such as seabirds, are poorly understood. As top predators, seabirds are ideal bio-indicators of the prevalence of contaminants and pollutants in marine ecosystems. At-sea foraging distributions of Streaked Shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) from Mikura Island (MKR), Japan during the post egg-laying period coincide with the Fukushima nuclear plume while the breeding colony on Birou Island (BRU) lies outside the affected zone. We examined the physiological responses of Streaked Shearwater chicks at MKR and BRU to possible radiation exposure during the 2011 breeding season, four to seven months after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Fledging mass did not differ between islands but fledglings from MKR displayed significantly reduced vitamin A levels. Available information suggests these depletions most likely result from radiation exposure due to the Fukushima nuclear accident, implying that the risk of radionuclide contamination is considerably elevated for Streaked Shearwaters on MKR, where more than 60% of the world's population breeds. While additional negative impacts are expected due to delayed effects of radionuclide transport via biomagnification in the food chain, this study highlights the potential immediate and worrisome consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident for marine wildlife.

J	Wang, HB; Jia, XP; Li, K; Wang, HF				Wang, Haibing; Jia, Xiaopeng; Li, Kuan; Wang, Hongfang			External supply of dust in the Taklamakan sand sea, Northwest China, reveals the dust-forming processes of the modern sand sea surface	CATENA												As one of the most important global dust sources, the sand sea and neighboring areas contain multiple types of surfaces that release dust, such as dry lakes and riverbeds, degraded oases, and Gobi surfaces. To understand the link between those active sources of dust and the dust formation process of the sand sea surface, we investigated dust fallout characteristics at a height of 3 m and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry of different landforms in the Taklamakan sand sea, which has frequent dust events. The seasonal fallout and concentrations of PM10 particles and monitoring results of their land surface concentrations show that the Taklamakan sand sea is surrounded by dust sources, and it's an important dust deposit area. The particle size characteristics of dust sediment suggest that the dust-conveying capacity of the Taklamakan sand sea is much stronger than that of the Gobi and degraded surfaces on the sand sea edge. During sand/dust storms, the fine dust fraction (<40 pm) can frequently recycle between the Taklamakan sand sea and the active dust emission areas. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns and Eu/Eu* vs. La (CH)/Yb CH and (La/Yb)(CH) vs. La-CH ratios of land surface PM10 fraction and dust PM10 fractions further suggest that there are two types of cycle processes for fine dust particles (<40 pm) between the Taklamakan sand sea and surrounding Gobi and degraded land. First, multiple large scale sand/dust storms have occurred between the Taklamakan sand sea and surrounding Gobi and degraded land over a long historical period. This has caused the fine fractions of land surface sediment to be strongly mixed over the entire Tarim Basin, and the geochemical characteristics of the land surface PM10 fractions have strong homogeneity. Second, a localized and seasonal sand/dust storms has released an abundance of fine dust particles from the surrounding area. These have been mixed and deposited in the Taklamakan sand sea under the dominant wind force, and most particulate material are probably also reworked by the wind as the sand saltates and the dunes migrate, resulting in REE concentrations of the dust PM10 fraction that are much higher than those from the surrounding areas.

J	Zhou, XQ; Shen, YM; Tang, J				Zhou, Xin-qiang; Shen, Yong-ming; Tang, Jun			Numerical modeling of water diversion impacts on water quality improvement in Lake Dianchi	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model was employed to investigate water quality improvement in Waihai of Lake Dianchi under different water diversion scenarios, including different volumes, inflow/outflow locations, and seasonal allocations. The accuracy of coupled model was reasonably validated against observed data on water level and temperature, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll- a (Chl-a) concentrations. Further analysis reveals water diversion significantly improves Waihai's water quality. In northern Waihai, the annual average TP and TN concentrations decrease by 27.2% and 26.1%. The average Chl-a concentration decreases by 36.8% during wet season. Increasing water diversion volume emerges as the most effective strategy for improving water quality. Designating the Panlong River as the inlet and the Jiezhi Gate as the primary outlet for diverted water proves more advantageous in reducing TP, TN, and Chl-a concentrations. Concentrating diverted water during wet season leads to more substantial reductions in Chl-a concentrations.																			1364-8152	1873-6726				APR	2025	187								106375	10.1016/j.envsoft.2025.106375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2025.106375		FEB 2025											WOS:001429468100001

Structure and Dynamics of Mollusk Communities of Small Oxbow Lakes and the Determining Factors (the Khoper River Valley, Penza Oblast)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The structure and dynamics of mollusk communities, as well as environmental factors influencing them, were analyzed in small oxbow lakes of the forest-steppe zone (a case of the Khoper river valley, Penza region, Russian Federation). 19 species of mollusks were found in the studied water bodies. The oxbow lakes were characterized by relatively low alpha-diversity (number of species 4 +/- 2) and relatively high beta-diversity (Jacquard index 0.26 +/- 0.18), which is typical for floodplain ecosystems. Lake communities were dominated by Planorbis planorbis (40%), Lymnaea stagnalis (15%), Anisus spirorbis (14%), Lymnaea saridalensis (9%), Anisus vortex (8%). The results of our analysis showed that the group of factors that determined the type of water body (stability, light intensity, water temperature, oxygen concentrations) had the greatest impact on the structure of malacocenoses. The seasonal dynamics of mollusk communities was determined by the number of adjoining water bodies, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The number of adjoining oxbows was the major factor influencing mollusk species diversity, as well as the total number and biomass of mollusks. Oxbow isolation was favorable for mollusk communities. The factors influencing the highest number of mollusks species (seven) were the light intensity and the presence of fish. Other significant factors were the stability of lakes (shown for five species of mollusks), the number of adjoining oxbows and water transparency (four species). Aquatic vegetation positively correlated with the abundance of only one species-Anisus vortex. Our data suggest that the presence of fish could influence the abundance of Lymnaea saridalensis. The mollusks, in their turn, apparently, had a positive effect on the abundance of leeches in water bodies. Mollusk species most sensitive to the external factors were Lymnaea stagnalis, Lymnaea saridalensis, Aplexa turrita, Anisus spirorbis and Anisus leucostoma, most tolerant were Bathyomphalus crassus, Anisus vortex, Planorbis planorbis and Planorbarius corneus.

Empirical modelling of suspended solids in a subtropical lagoon (Brazil) using linear spectral mixing algorithm	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												The Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) technique has been used in remote sensing applications and allows the estimation of the proportional contribution of different constituents in the pixel reflectance. Despite the great potential for vegetation and land cover studies, there are few studies examining the LSMM efficiency for optically complex inland waters. In addition, LSMM-derived images have shown a promising application in water quality mapping. In this context, Mirim lagoon (Brazil) presents seasonal variability of suspended solids (SS) influenced by sediment yield from tributaries and surrounding areas (e.g.: croplands). While negative impact on water quality makes relevant the SS mapping for management of this ecosystem, there is no studies using remote sensoing in this lagoon. This study develops an empirical model for SS concentration in the Northern Mirim lagoon using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The framework applies the linear spectral mixing algorithm in two MSI images and the empirical model was developed using the multiple linear regression. We validated the model performance using Monte Carlo simulation method. The mapping of SS was satisfactory in both images: the estimated concentrations are consistent with in-situ measurements. The results show that LSMM application supports the mapping of SS and its spatial distribution. Finally, this study is the first application of Sentinel-2 MSI images in the Mirim lagoon and the results present the potential of this empirical modelling for sediment mapping. The spatial information supports the local managers to understand the sources of degradation of water quality and protect this aquatic ecosystem.					; Guedes, Hugo/I-5007-2014; Martins, Vitor/AAD-1221-2020; Fassoni-Andrade, Alice/LZG-0056-2025; Monks, Jander/OFO-4460-2025	Martins, Vitor Souza/0000-0003-3802-0368; Brocca Caballero, Cassia/0000-0001-7634-2902; Fernandes Monks, Jander Luis/0000-0003-3616-3314; Fassoni de Andrade, Alice/0000-0002-3233-8781; 													2352-9385					NOV	2020	20								100380	10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100380													WOS:000654346100005

To emphasize species interactions, sampling was carried out at the peak of the dry season (May) when a concentration effect was expected to take place as a consequence of lake volume reduction. Prey selection differed among species: Chirostoma consocium selected cyclopoid and calanoid copepods; C. jordani selected Bosmina and Diaphanosoma; C. labarcae selected Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia. Larger fishes occasionally consumed Hemipteran larvae. Although two Chirostoma species preyed upon the same zooplankton species, prey selection was consistent across size classes. From a total of 32 morphometric and meristic characteristics related to trophic ecology, 13 characteristics differentiated species, according to the discriminant analysis. Ordination including 11 morphometric characteristics and six zooplankton food items graphically separated the three species. The first axis separated species according to prey classes (copepods vs. cladocerans) and gross morphology (head and anal fin lengths). The second axis emphasized size-selective predation on cladocerans (Bosmina vs. Daphnia consumers) and fine trophic morphology (oral gape and the gill rakers' structure). Our findings suggest that the permanence of all three species in a fluctuating environment is the result of the circumvention of competition by niche partitioning, promoted by prey availability, selective predation, and few but critical differences in trophic morphology.

Comparative histology of the testes of the spined loach Cobitis taenia L. and natural allotetraploids of Cobitis (Pisces, Cobitidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The spined loach Cobitis taenia L. creates exclusively diploid and mixed diploid-polyploid populations. Allotriploid females, which co-exist with C. taenia or C. elongatoides and a few tetraploid males and females dominate in most Cobitis mixed populations. They reproduce gynogenetically and produce triploid eggs that are stimulated to development by sperm from Cobitis males. Some of these eggs are fertilized, which leads to the production of bisexual tetraploids. Males of C. taenia (2n = 48) from a diploid population in Lake Klawoj, Northern Poland (46 individuals) and from a mixed Cobitis population in the Bug River, Eastern Poland (7 individuals), and three tetraploid males (4n = 98) from the same mixed population were examined. All the fish were analyzed karyologically and histologically. Tubules with cysts of the testes of C. taenia from both populations were filled with germ cells at various developmental stages. Among fishes from Lake Klawoj sperm maturation in batches simultaneous with the batch spawning of C. taenia females was found. The testes of the loach C. taenia, from a mixed population in the Bug River, were filled with spermatozoa over the entire reproductive season. Sperm maturation in batches was not observed. Sperm maturation in batches seems to be only connected with a few diploid males in this population. So, a continuous process of spermatogenesis in their testes is required. Only in the testes of all tetraploid Cobitis males were cells characteristic of the early stages of spermatogenesis observed, i.e. without spermatids and spermatozoa. Furthermore, the histological sections of the testis of a male captured in August, revealed fragments with connective tissue between the germ cells. However the participation of tetraploid, infertile Cobitis males in the process of reproduction in the investigated mixed population remains controversial. The results obtained so far, reveal that even the infertile sperm of tetraploid males may induce gynogenesis in Cobitis triploid females.

H.; Lafreniere, Melissa J.; Atkinson, David M.; Treitz, Paul			An incidence of multi-year sediment storage on channel snowpack in the Canadian High Arctic	ARCTIC												During June 2005, we identified the presence of sediment buried within mufti-year channel snowpack of a small river located near Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut (74 degrees 55' N, 109 degrees 35' W). Photographic evidence indicates that the sediment was deposited during the 2003 season by the initial meltwater flowing on the snowpack, which was dammed by snow upstream of a channel constriction. The resulting pond covered a minimum area of 180 m(2) and contained an estimated minimum 27 Mg of sediment. Suspended sediment measurements during the 2003 season indicate that deposition on the snowpack at this location represented 49%-65% of the sediment transport prior to the ponding and emplacement of the sediment on the snow, and approximately 20% of the measured sediment flux for the entire season. Mufti-year snow accumulations immediately downstream exhibited similar sediment deposition on snow, but no evidence of mufti-year sediment storage was present. By contrast, a similar stream in an adjacent watershed channelized rapidly, with minimal sediment deposition on the snow, and delivered a large pulse of sediment to the downstream lake. These results provide quantitative evidence for the magnitude of sediment storage on snowpack and point to the unique role that snow plays in the fluvial geomorphology of High Arctic watersheds.					; Treitz, Paul/AFM-0165-2022	ATKINSON, DAVID/0009-0000-9330-158X; Lafreniere, Melissa/0000-0002-9639-6825; Cockburn, Jaclyn/0000-0002-1326-4457; 													0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2006	59	4					381	390																WOS:000242840400005

Comparison of the lake sediment data set for the 20th century (sediment mass accumulation rates MARs, pollen spectra, nutrient and charcoal fluxes) with independent dendroecological data from the catchment (fire scars, tree growth) and long regional precipitation series (from 1934 onwards) show that (1) the lake sediment data set is internally highly consistent and compares well with independent data sets, (2) the chronology of the sediment is reliable, (3) large fires (1940s, 1983/1984-1989) as documented in the local fire scar frequency are recorded in the charcoal flux to the lake sediments and coincide with low wet-season precipitation rates (e.g., 1940s, 1983/1984) and/or high interannual precipitation variability (late 1940s), and (4) the regional increase in precipitation after 1970 is recorded in an increase in the MARs (L. Rodeo from 100 to 390 mgcm(-2) yr(-1)) and in an increase in fern spores reflecting wet vegetation. The most significant change in MARs and nutrient fluxes (C-org and P) of the past 2000 years is observed with the transition from the Inca Empire to the Spanish Conquest around 1600 AD. Compared with the pre-17th century conditions, MARs increased by a factor of ca. 5 to > 8 (to 800(+130,) (-280) mgcm(-2) yr(-1)), PO4 fluxes increased by a factor of 7, and C-org fluxes by a factor of 10.5 for the time between 1640 and 1930 AD. 17th to 19th century MARs and nutrient fluxes also exceed 20th century values. Excess Ph deposition as indicated by a significant increase in Pb/Zr and Pb/Rb ratios in the sediments after the 1950s coincides with a rapid expansion of the regional mining industry. Excess Ph is interpreted as atmospheric deposition and direct human impact due to Pb smelting. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

These water bodies are fed mainly by rainfall and melting snow. Some of them are temporary while others are permanent and show seasonal variations in chemical properties (e.g. pH 4.6-5.0 to 6.8-7.7). The structure of the algal communities differed in particular ponds, depending on the water pH and its seasonal changes. Moreover, there are differences in the composition of the macro-invertebrate communities between particular ponds, but they were not affected by the water acidification occurring mainly during the snow-melting period. The present investigations show that the impact of acid precipitation on biocenoses living in high mountain water bodies (Tatra Mts) is not clearly evident.

Previous studies have quantified the diet of this turtle, but few have addressed seasonal and sexual differences. Stomach and fecal samples were collected from June through October 1998. Although males and females consumed similar taxa, there were monthly dietary differences likely, in part, because of sexual differences in peak activity and reproductive conditions. Patterns of consumption suggest that Stinkpots are omnivorous but show some dietary preferences.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				JUN	2004	38	2					296	301		10.1670/172-03N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/172-03N													WOS:000222452800022

Over a 2 year period, 600 consumers were interviewed at three locations (urban and rural) in the Lake Zone of Tanzania and their preference of 14 locally available sweetpotato cultivars in cooked form was evaluated. A simple questionnaire based on consumers first-choice preference was used followed by socio-economic questions. A trained sensory panel profiled the cooked sweetpotato samples, enabling comparisons with preference, location and season. Cluster analysis based on the sensory attributes was used to classify the cultivars into three groups; one cluster comprised the most preferred cultivars and another contained the least. Some cultivars were consistently preferred over the 2 year period while others were not. The location where the cultivars were grown also influenced preference. Stepwise regression indicated that the most discriminating sensory attributes were starch and stickiness. Target levels based on the mean intensity scores of these attributes are suggested as a means of screening new cultivars. The implications of these findings are discussed.

A total of 38 permanent 0.040-ha plots were located among five different prescription burn sites treated during October 1997. An additional twenty-seven 0.040 ha plots were located in adjacent unburned forest stands. All trees within-study plots were visited thrice between June and October of 1998. Results showed a highly significant correlation between burning and bark beetle presence. Over 24% of trees in prescription burn plots were attacked by one or more species of bark beetle. Less than 1% of all non-burned trees were similarly attacked. Highly significant multiple logistic regression models were developed for each of the two occurring species of Dendroctonus and a composite model for all observed species of Ips. The indirect burn severity measurements of crown scorch, duff consumption, and bole scorch were highly significant; other tested variables were species specific or not significant.

J	Lacoul, P; Freedman, B				Lacoul, P.; Freedman, B.			Recent observation of a proliferation of Ranunculus trichophyllus Chaix. in high-altitude lakes of the Mount Everest Region	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Large populations of the threadleaf water-crowfoot, Ranunculus trichophyllus, were discovered in several high-altitude lakes in the Himalayas of Nepal in which the species did not occur as recently as 1987. One of the study lakes, at 4760 m, is the highest altitude from which an aquatic angiosperm has been reported. A canonical discriminant analysis suggests that the key environmental factors differing between vegetated and non-vegetated lakes among a chain of five interconnected water bodies are length of the ice-free season, conductivity, non-volatile suspended solids, and bicarbonate. We believe, however, that an increased length of the ice-free season is likely the controlling factor in the recent invasion by Ranunculus trichophyllus. Its range expansion is likely a signal of a warming alpine climate in our study area.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2006	38	3					394	398		10.1657/1523-0430(2006)38[394:ROOAPO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2006)38[394:ROOAPO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000240449600011

We analyzed the delta C-13, delta O-18, and delta H-2 of cellulose of conifer trees from several cross-sections at each of 9 sites around the Great Lakes region ranging from similar to 4000 to 14,000 cal BP. Isotopic values of Picea, Pinus, and Thuja species seem interchangeable for delta O-18 and delta H-2 comparisons, but Thuja appears distinctly different from the other 2 in its delta C-13 composition. isotopic results suggest that the 2 sites of near-Younger Dryas age experienced the coldest conditions, although the Gribben Basin site near the Laurentide ice sheet was relatively dry, whereas the Liverpool site 500 km south was moister. The spatial isotopic variability of 3 of the 4 sites of Two Creeks age shows evidence of an elevation effect, perhaps related to sites farther inland from the Lake Michigan shoreline experiencing warmer daytime growing season temperatures. Thus, despite floristic similarity across sites (wood samples at 7 of the sites being Picea), the isotopes appear to reflect environmental differences that might not be readily evident from a purely floristic interpretation of macrofossil or pollen identification.					; Panyushkina, Irina/AAG-6228-2020; Leavitt, Steven/W-2257-2019; Wiedenhoeft, Alex/AAE-6626-2020	Leavitt, Steven/0000-0002-7291-208X; Panyushkina, Irina/0000-0001-8854-2637; Wiedenhoeft, Alex/0000-0002-7053-8565													0033-8222						2006	48	2					205	217		10.1017/S0033822200066406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200066406													WOS:000239324000004

In this study, we collected the seasonal river waters of the Buha River, the largest inlet river of Qinghai Lake, which is sensitive to climate change, and analyzed its seasonal variations of the major ions, B concentrations, and delta 11B, to explore its sources and controlling factors. The results indicate that B in the Buha River predominantly originates from weathering of silicate rocks, with significantly seasonal variations in the geochemical behaviour of B isotopes. In the rainy seasons, the riverine B isotopic fractionation is primarily controlled by weathering of silicate rocks under the influence of hydrological conditions, where clay minerals preferentially absorb 10B, leading to the enrichment of heavier B isotopes in river waters. In contrast, in the dry seasons, the B of river waters may mainly come from the recharge of groundwater (whose delta 11B with a notable pH dependence); owing to prolonged retention of fluids, the steady state of delta 11B is reached by the isotopic equilibrium through adsorption of clay minerals. This study highlights that the seasonal variations in riverine delta 11B in semi-arid regions are jointly governed by silicate weathering, hydrological conditions, and water-rock interactions, with water pH and rainfall as key regulators. Consequently, riverine delta 11B in the rainy seasons under semi-arid climatic conditions can effectively trace hydrologically-controlled silicate weathering processes within the watershed.

Seasonal water level fluctuations cause opposite changes in fish trophic dynamics in Amazonian black-water and white-water lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Amazonian floodplain lakes, distinguished by their water types, are crucial ecosystems for fish biodiversity. In these ecosystems, the annual hydrological cycle, known as the "flood pulse," is the primary driving force for fish productivity, providing habitat and feeding opportunities. However, how seasonal water level changes affect fish assemblages and feeding guild responses in floodplains with varying watershed characteristics is still poorly understood. We conducted a comparative stable isotope study in both a white-water and a black-water floodplain lake to investigate fish trophic dynamics during periods of rising and low water levels. Analyses of a broad taxonomic range of fish (seven orders and 27 families, with 73 and 82 taxa in the studied lakes, respectively) revealed that the fish assemblages in the studied white-water and black-water lakes exhibited different trophic dynamics in response to changes induced by the hydrological cycle. In contrast to the white-water lake, a strong, trophic guild-related effect shaped the delta 13C and delta 15N dynamics in the black-water lake. As a result, the fish assemblage in the black-water lake experienced significant trophic shifts with generally opposite dynamics over the water levels compared to the white-water lake. In the black-water lake, water level changes caused alterations in trophic niche width in almost all analyzed guilds (carnivorous, detritivorous, herbivorous, invertivorous, omnivorous, planktivorous), while this was less consistent in the white-water lake. Our results suggest that the fish assemblage in the nutrient-poor black-water lake is more dependent on the annual flood pulse and associated resources than in the white-water lake. These findings may further imply a relatively higher vulnerability of the black-water lake to alterations in the regular flood pulse compared to the white-water lake, indicating greater stability in feeding conditions and fish trophic dynamics in the latter.

Results revealed that major cations except Na decreased, whereas major anions except NO3- and PO43- increased in the post-monsoon. ANOVA indicated that pH, EC, TDS, Na ?, HCO3 -, Cl- and NO3-, PO43- showed significant seasonal variation in the P. T. Tso Lake. Wet precipitations of aerosols were found to be the most important source of major ions. Lake water chemistry is attributed to long-range transport of air pollutant through dry precipitation in the pre-monsoon, and by chemical weathering, biological and mineralization processes in post-monsoon. In pre-monsoon, trace elements were found to be in the order of Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Cd with slight change in Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu in post-monsoon. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory ( HYSPLIT) model developed by NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory was used to understand the long-range transport and depositions of aerosols. The results of HYSPLIT back-trajectory model illustrate that air arriving in the vicinity of the lake has an origin from the southeast direction and the mid-Gangetic plain during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season, respectively. The interrelationship among trace elements in the projection of factor 1 and 2 implies that natural weathering and metal-containing aerosols transported from elsewhere may be the governing processes for lake water chemistry. The study suggests that seasonal changes in water chemistry of high-altitude lakes can reflect the imprints of change introduced through long-rangetransported pollution. Long-term monitoring programs are recommended for periodic evaluation of the high-altitude lakes worldwide in order to trace climate change impacts.

Identification of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush spawning habitat in northern Lake Huron using high-resolution satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The availability and quality of spawning habitat may limit lake trout recovery in the Great Lakes, but comprehensive maps of current spawning habitats are unavailable at the basin scale. Current methods used to identify lake trout spawning locations are time- and labor-intensive and spatially limited. Due to the observation that some lake trout spawning sites are relatively clean of overlaying algae compared to adjacent areas not used for spawning, we hypothesized that spawning sites could be identified using satellite imagery. Satellite imagery collected just before and after the spawning season in 2013 was used to assess whether lake trout spawning habitat could be identified based on its spectral characteristics. Results indicated that Pleiades high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery can be successfully used to estimate the vegetative cover of substrates and temporal changes in vegetative coverage, and that models developed from processed imagery can be used to identify potential shallow water lake trout spawning sites based on comparison of sites where lake trout eggs were and were not observed after spawning.

High rates of nitrogen cycling in volcanic soils from Chilean grasslands	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY					Combined Meetings of the BMSS Special Interest Group on Stable Isotopes (BMSS ISO-SIG)/ Stable Isotopes Mass Spectrometry Users Group (SIMSUG)/ Stable Isotopes in Biosphere-Atmosphere-Earth System Research (SIBAE)	APR 27-30, 2010	Univ Exeter, Exeter, ENGLAND		Univ Exeter			There are over one million hectares of pasture in Chile, and 80% and 50% of the country's milk and meat comes from 72% of this area, situated in the lake region of southern Chile. The soils are volcanic and a major characteristic is that they have very high organic matter (OM) contents with the potential to support plant growth with only moderate levels of added nitrogen (N). To understand better the potential fertility of these soils in order to maximise production and minimise losses of N, we undertook studies using the stable isotope of N ((15)N) to resolve the rates of the main internal N cycling processes in three soils representing the two main volcanic soil types: Osorno and Chiloe (Andisol) and Cudico (Ultisol). We also assessed the longer-term potential of these soils to sustain N release using anaerobic incubation. Gross rates (mu g N g(-1) day(-1)) of mineralisation were 27.9, 27.1 and 15.5 and rates of immobilisation were 5.9, 12.0 and 6.3 for Osorno, Chiloe and Cudico, respectively, implying high rates of net mineralisation in these soils. This was confirmed by anaerobic incubation which gave potential seasonal net mineralisation indices of 1225, 1059 and 450 kg N ha(-1) in the top 10 cm soil layers of the three soils. However, plant production may still benefit from added N, as the release of N from organic sources may not be closely synchronised with crop demand. The low rates of nitrification that we found with these acidic soils suggest that the more mobile N (viz. nitrate-N) would be in limited supply and plants would have to compete for the less mobile ammonium-N with the soil microbial biomass. Nitrogen was mineralised in appreciable amounts even down to 60 cm depth, so that leaching could become significant, particularly if the soils were limed, which could enhance nitrification and N mobility through the soil profile.

J	Asitatikie, AN; Nigussie, ED				Asitatikie, Asimamaw Nigusie; Nigussie, Endalkachew Diress			Modeling on naturalization of inflow and outflow nutrients sources of Blue Nile River at the Lake Tana in Basaltic Plateau of Ethiopia	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tana is the largest natural reservoir in Ethiopia and the head water of Abbay basin. However, after building of an irrigation weir and further lying Tunnel to Tana Belles, Lake Tana maximum amplitude of water level canges from 2.18 to 3.56 m that differ substantially in 1.38 m from amplitude of natural water level fluctuation. Understanding the natural characteristics of the Lake is important to know its water balance and for sustainable development. But it is difficult to study the natural characteristics of the Lake and its water balance using the regulated water level and outflow data sets. Thus it is evident that the regulated water level and outflow data sets have to be first naturalized before they are used for any analysis and modeling. Lake level and outflow data that have been collected since 1976 were considered to assess the regulation effect and then for naturalization. Inflows to the Lake from the main tributaries have also been collected to find if there are any correlations with either the Lake Level and/or the outflow. Regression analyses were used to develop the naturalization models. The regression analyses of flows from Gilgel Abay and Gummar with Lake Level shows that there is a very good correlation between them in different seasons. Besides, same has also been observed between Lake Level and out flow. These relationships can be used to naturalize the regulated outflow and water level.																			2363-6203	2363-6211				NOV	2021	7	4					2283	2295		10.1007/s40808-020-00972-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-020-00972-x		OCT 2020											WOS:000581547500001

Stage recorders, recording thermistors, sediment traps, and underflow monitoring equipment were deployed during the 1999 melt season. Episodic proximal turbidity currents were measured as positive near-bottom temperature anomalies and currents. The timing of individual positive temperature anomalies was clearly associated with diurnal peaks of discharge into the lake. During the period of 23 to 25 July, continuous underflow occurred, which preceded a large discharge event by about 24 h. Sediment traps placed throughout the lake recorded sediment accumulation rates from 16 June to 4 August. An extremely large precipitation event occurred on 29 June, when coarse, carbonate-rich sediment was deposited in front of a secondary tributary by spatially limited turbidity currents. A niveo-eolian deposit was observed on the lake ice, and sediment traps were deployed under this area. Mass accumulation rates in these traps locally overwhelmed fluvially generated sedimentation. This sediment was dominantly sand, which quickly melted through the lake ice and hastened the date of localized break-up.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				MAY	2002	34	2					119	129		10.2307/1552463	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552463													WOS:000176962800001

The calibration of the parameters for the model provided that the established reference model simulation could reproduce complex seasonal biomass behavior of populations that were not significantly different from the general seasonal pattern for the Lake Suwa ecosystem. The sensitivity analyses revealed the potential importance of indirect effects and demonstrated that the parameter values of all the trophic levels were important in determining the biomass of each trophic level in the model. The risk estimation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) demonstrated that the model estimated the risks of direct toxic effects on each population and the indirect ecological effects that propagate through the food-web in the model ecosystem. The CASM-SUWA-derived benchmark levels were approximately one order of magnitude less than the field-derived NOECs in literature. The analyses of the comparison implied that the model could provide a good basis in determining an ecological protective level of a chemical of concern in aquatic ecosystem. This modeling study demonstrated that the model can be used to provide additional information for the decision-making process in the management of the aquatic ecological risk of chemicals.

J	Nurminen, LKL; Horppila, JA				Nurminen, LKL; Horppila, JA			A diurnal study on the distribution of filter feeding zooplankton: Effect of emergent macrophytes, pH and lake trophy	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The objective of the present study was to investigate the importance of emergent macrophytes as refugia in lakes of different trophic status. Furthermore, the effect of water quality on diel changes in the distribution of littoral cladocerans was of interest, with special attention paid on diurnal fluctuations of filter feeder communities, induced by pH changes under a heavy phytoplankton bloom. The study was conducted by investigating littoral cladoceran populations in different zones (inside, at the edge and outside the macrophyte stands) in two basins with divergent water quality. No tendency towards diurnal migration related to emergent macrophytes was observed in the clear-water, mesotrophic Isontalonselka basin. The dominating cladoceran, Daphnia spp., formed highest densities during daytime in the outer zone. Meanwhile, strong nocturnal cladoceran density peaks in all zones, simultaneous with lowered pH, were witnessed in the very turbid, hypertrophic Kirkkojarvi basin. Reverse horizontal migration was observed in large-bodied filter feeders, Limnosida frontosa and Sida crystallina, conceivably due to predation avoidance from young-of-the-year fish aggregating within the vegetation during the day.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					2002	64	2					198	206		10.1007/s00027-002-8067-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-002-8067-8													WOS:000176983900009

For the sampling of rainwater, a wet-only rainwater sampler was used together with an open collector to take the measurements of precipitation. PAHs in rainwater were extracted by using SPE cartridges and analyzed by HPLC-fluorescence following a method developed in the laboratory. Mean concentrations of all PAHs ( 16 HAPs) varied between 0.15 and 79.60 ngL-1 in Erstein, and between 3.70 and 1596.45 ngL-1 in Strasbourg. Naphtalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo[j]fluoranthne and benzo[a]pyrene were the most concentrated PAHs analyzed. Benzo[a]pyrene was frequently detected. Seasonal effects were observed with a maximum of concentrations of PAHs during cold periods. Some spatial influences were also reported. The calculation of some PAH ratios show that diesel exhaust could be the main source of PAHs in rainwater on the two sites.																			1040-6638	1563-5333					2008	28	4-5					472	485	PII 905731149	10.1080/10406630802377898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10406630802377898													WOS:000261089100019

The seasonal distribution followed a biacmic pattern in the first year and a monoacmic in the second. Copepoda prevailed, with the calanoid Eudiaptomus driesci being the dominant species. No differences in the horizontal distribution of the zooplankton community were found. The maximum abundance of the zooplankton community was recorded in the surface 0-10 m layer and abundance decreased with depth. The most important species of rotifers follow a vertical separation pattern, while the cladocerans revealed either a seasonal succession of dominance, or a vertical separation. Although Lake Trichonis holds the basic characteristics of an oligotrophic lake, the presence of certain species typical of eutrophic lakes, could reflect a possible alteration of its trophic state.																			0022-2933	1464-5262					2008	42	5-8					575	595		10.1080/00222930701835555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701835555													WOS:000256797700024
J	Ke, ZX; Xie, P; Guo, LG				Ke, Zhixin; Xie, Ping; Guo, Longgen			Phenotypic plasticity in gut length in the planktivorous filter-feeding silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)	THESCIENTIFICWORLDJOURNAL												Phenotypic plasticity widely exists in the external morphology of animals as well as the internal traits of organs. In the present study, we studied the gut length plasticity of planktivorous filter-feeding silver carp under different food resources in large-net cage experiments in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu in 2004 and 2005. There was a significant difference in stocking density between these 2 years. Under a low stocking density and abundant food resources, silver carp increased their energy intake by feeding on more zooplankton. Meanwhile, silver carp adjusted their gut length to match the digestive requirements of food when exposed to different food resources. In the main growth seasons (from April to October), silver carp significantly increased their relative gut length when feeding on more phytoplankton in 2005 (p < 0.01, 9.23 +/- 1.80 in 2004 and 10.77 +/- 2.05 in 2005, respectively). There was a nearly significant negative correlation between zooplankton proportion in the diet and the relative gut length when silver carp were stocked in a high density (p = 0.112). It appears that silver carp might have evolved plasticity to change their gut length rapidly to facilitate efficient utilization of food resources. Such resource polymorphisms in the gut may be a good indication of temporal adaptation to resource conditions. Our work provided field evidence for understanding the functional basis of resource polymorphisms and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in planktivorous filter-feeding fish.					ke, zhixin/O-7826-2014; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020														1537-744X						2008	8						169	175		10.1100/tsw.2008.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2008.37								18301818					WOS:000254985000019

Floristic shifts in wetlands:: the effects of environmental variables on the interaction between Phragmites australis (Common Reed) and Melaleuca ericifolia (Swamp Paperbark)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Over the past 40-50 years, the woody shrub Melaleuca ericifolia has progressively invaded large areas of Phragmites australis in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish wetland in south-eastern Australia. To understand the processes underlying this shift we grew Phragmites and Melaleuca alone and together under contrasting sediment organic-matter loadings and salinities. To examine if the capacity of Phragmites to aerate the sediment influenced plant interactions, we also dissipated convective gas flow in some Phragmites plants by perforating their stems. Although Phragmites suppressed the growth of Melaleuca under all conditions, Melaleuca persisted. We did not find Phragmites ramets to be more sensitive to salinity than Melaleuca seedlings. Surprisingly Phragmites did not increase sediment redox and was more sensitive to increased organic-matter loading than Melaleuca. These results do not support the notion that colonisation by Melaleuca was facilitated by a decline in Phragmites at higher salinities or through aeration of the sediments by Phragmites. Seedlings of Melaleuca, however, were easily blown over by wind and it is likely that Phragmites stands shelter Melaleuca during establishment. Although our short-term experiment did not show that Melaleuca was a better competitor, differences in seasonal growth patterns may contribute to a shift in competitive abilities over a longer time scale.																			1323-1650						2008	59	3					187	204		10.1071/MF07072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF07072													WOS:000255525400001
J	Rueda, FJ; Cowen, EA				Rueda, FJ; Cowen, EA			Exchange between a freshwater embayment and a large lake through a long, shallow channel	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We analyze the exchange between a weakly forced lacustrine embayment and a large lake through a long, shallow channel. Exchange in the channel is the result of a multiple and subtle balance in which spatial thermal variations (baroclinic forcing), oscillations in the water level (barotropic forcing), bottom friction, diffusion, wind forcing, and the effects of unsteadiness are all important. Temperature gradients across the channel result from differences in thermal inertia of the embayment and lake at seasonal time scales and differences in the wind-driven internal dynamics of the lake and the embayment at diurnal to synoptic time scales. These gradients are, in general, weak and barotropic forcing dominates the channel momentum balance; however, episodic upwelling in the lake can shift the balance in favor of baroclinic dominance. A combination of scaling, analysis of observational data, and three-dimensional simulations are used to demonstrate that bed stress, vertical turbulent diffusion, wind stress, and unsteadiness effect exchange relative to the predictions of internal hydraulic theory-the quasisteady inviscid theory that describes the motion resulting from a purely barotropic/baroclinic force balance.

Bloom samples taken from the West Bay and East Cove stations of the lake were studied in relation to the characteristics of environmental conditions. Four types of microcystins, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), microcystin-RR (MC-RR), 6(Z)-Adda-microcystin-RR, and 3-desmethylmicrocystin-LR were identified from the natural bloom samples among which MC-LR was the most dominant type of microcystin. Production of microcystin (88.6 mug/100 mg dried cells) was highest during the first sampling week that coincided with high water transparency and high conductivity. The occurrence of a strong typhoon during the second sampling week had changed the environment drastically, which was characterized by low water transparency, high turbidity, low water temperature, and with trace amounts of MC-LR detected at the East Cove station. Thus, toxin production over time as well as the relationship between Microcystis production and toxin concentration could not be fully evaluated.

J	Amat, JA; Fraga, RM; Arroyo, GM				Amat, JA; Fraga, RM; Arroyo, GM			Brood desertion and polygamous breeding in the Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus	IBIS												In the Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus one of the adults, typically the female, deserts the brood when the chicks are a few days old. Once parental care is terminated, adults may initiate a second nesting attempt if sufficient time remains within the season. For these nests, individuals pair with different mates from those of the First nesting attempt, thus becoming sequentially polygamous. In a small population of Kentish Plovers in Fuente de Piedra lake (southern Spain), the duration of biparental care of broods was longer than in other localities. It also showed considerable variation between years that was evidently related to Gull-billed Tern Gelochelidon nilotica predation pressure on the chicks. There was year-to-year variation in the number of polygamous matings. Both the duration of the breeding season and nesting success in the first half of the season limited the occurrence of polygamy. Despite females deserting broods earlier than males, the interval between the first and second nesting of polyandrous females and polygynous males was similar. The interval was not affected by the body condition of females after the first nesting attempt, nor by problems related to egg formation ability, but was probably due to the availability of potential mates. More females than males initiated second nests, suggesting that polygamous opportunities were more limited for males than for females. In terms of delayed breeding, reduced survivorship or reduced breeding opportunities in years following polygamous breeding, polygamous individuals did not have greater costs; than non-polygamous ones. Females with second nests did not seem to be selective in mate choice, mating with any available male. Mates for second nests may therefore be of lower quality than those for first nests, as judged by male plumage characteristics. Clutch sizes and egg characteristics of polyandrous females were similar in first and second nests. Nest success of second nests was only 40% of that of first ones, with nest desertion accounting for 60% of the losses. As the costs of polygamy are apparently low and as breeding success is very variable among years, polygamous breeding of the long-lived Kentish Plover may be an important breeding strategy with which to increase individual lifetime reproductive success.					; Munoz Arroyo, Gonzalo/F-1703-2014; Arroyo, Gonzalo/F-1703-2014	Amat, Juan A./0000-0003-1685-1056; Munoz Arroyo, Gonzalo/0000-0002-1064-5342; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				OCT	1999	141	4					596	607		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1999.tb07367.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1999.tb07367.x													WOS:000083027000005
J	GIORGI, F; BRODEUR, CS; BATES, GT				GIORGI, F; BRODEUR, CS; BATES, GT			REGIONAL CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS OVER THE UNITED-STATES PRODUCED WITH A NESTED REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In this paper two continuous 31/2-year-long climate simulations over the continental United States are discussed, one for present-day conditions and one for conditions under double carbon dioxide concentration, conducted with a limited area model (LAM) nested in a general circulation model (GCM). The models used are a version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) at rhomboidal 15 spectral resolution and the climate version of the NCAR/Penn State mesoscale model (MM4) at 60-km gridpoint spacing. For present-day conditions the model temperatures are within 1-degrees-2-degrees-C of observations except over the Great Lakes region, where temperature is overpredicted by 4-degrees-6-degrees-C. The CCM overpredicts precipitation throughout the continental United States (overall by about 60%) and especially over the West (by up to 300%). The nested MM4 overpredicts precipitation over the West but underpredicts it over the eastern United States. In addition, it produces a large amount of topographically and lake-induced sub-GCM grid-scale detail that, especially during the cold season, compares well with available high-resolution climate data. Overall, based on a number of objective measures of climate simulation skill, the nested MM4 reproduces observed spatial and seasonal precipitation patterns better than the driving CCM. Doubled carbon dioxide-induced temperature change scenarios produced by the two models generally differ by less than several tenths of a degree except over the Great Lakes region where, because of the presence of the lakes in the nested model, the two model scenarios differ by more than one degree. Conversely, precipitation change scenarios from the two model simulations can locally differ in magnitude, sign, spatial, and seasonal detail. These differences are associated with topographical features in the MM4, such as the presence of steep coastal ranges in the western United States. This work illustrates the feasibility of the use of the nested modeling technique for long-term regional climate simulation.

J	Deng, C; Zhang, H; Hamilton, DP; Hollingsworth, A				Deng, Chao; Zhang, Hong; Hamilton, David P.; Hollingsworth, Anna			Impacts of changes in climate and water demand on flow in a subtropical river catchment below a major dam	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												River flow regime is important for ecosystem integrity and biodiversity, and is impacted by artificial water exploitation and regulation, extreme events and climate change. Environmental flows are designed to mitigate these impacts. In this work, we used catchment hydrological output simulated by the Soil & Water Assessment Tool model, evaporation rates calculated with the General Lake Model and a water resource management tool to calculate a water balance for a sub-tropical reservoir located in southeast Queensland, Australia under extreme dry conditions impacted by climate change. Two environmental flows, the 90th percentile of the daily flow duration curve (Q90) and the 90th percentile monthly flow for each season (Q90M), were used to assess water availability for multiple purposes including environmental releases and water supply from a subtropical water supply reservoir. Risks for the downstream river system were assessed using a flow alteration screening method by comparing a 20-year baseline period of no-dam from 1990 to 2009 with future climate change and water regulation conditions with the dam in place. A significant decrease in maximum flood peak, persistence of high- flow duration and the annual discharge from the reservoir occurred with future climate change and water demand scenarios compared with the no-dam baseline. The future changes in flow regime indicate a medium-to- high ecological risk for high flow conditions and moderate ecological risk during low flow conditions compared with the no-dam condition. An increased water demand in combination with future climate change leads to high ecological risks occurring by the end of this century under the high emission scenario of representative concentration pathway 8.5, regardless of the water regulations and environment flow management. The findings of this work indicate moderate to high inability to meet water demand under future climate-induced hydrological change. Therefore, catchment managers will need to take further actions to mitigate impacts from future climate change and population growth on water resources in this subtropical system.

Important aspects relate to the impact of sediment retaining hydropower dams, potential delta progradation, coastal sediment supply and delta vulnerability to sea level rise. Once validated, process-based models provide a valuable tool to address these aspects and offer detailed information on sediment pathways, distribution and budget in specific systems. This study aims to advance the understanding of the sediment dynamics and sediment budget in the Mekong Delta system. We developed a process-based model (Delft3D FM) that allows for coupling 2D area grids to 1D network grids. The flexible mesh describes both wide river sections and channel irrigation and drainage networks present in the Mekong Delta. We calibrated the model against observed discharge, salinity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and sediment flux. The model was able to skillfully describe seasonal variations of SSC and hysteresis of SSC and water discharge caused by the Tonle Sap Lake induced flow patterns and seasonally varying bed sediment availability in the channels. Model results suggest that the Mekong River delivers an amount of sediment, towards the delta which is much lower than the common estimate of 160 Mt/year. About 23% of the modeled total sediment load at Kratie reaches the sea. Our modeling approach is a useful tool to assess sediment dynamics under strategic anthropogenic interventions or climate change scenarios.					van der Spek, Ad/E-9695-2011; Thanh, Vo Quoc/AAH-4009-2019; Van Der Wegen, Mick/C-6787-2009														0278-4343	1873-6955				MAR	2025	286								105427	10.1016/j.csr.2025.105427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2025.105427		FEB 2025											WOS:001422726100001
J	Wacker, A; von Elert, E				Wacker, A; von Elert, E			Strong influences of larval diet history on subsequent post-settlement growth in the freshwater mollusc Dreissena polymorpha	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												A significant seasonal variation in size at settlement has been observed in newly settled larvae of Dreissena polymorpha in Lake Constance. Diet quality, which varies temporally and spatially in freshwater habitats, has been suggested as a significant factor influencing the life history and development of freshwater invertebrates. Accordingly, experiments were conducted with field-collected larvae to test the proposal that diet quality can determine planktonic larval growth rates, size at settlement and subsequent post-metamorphic growth rates. Larvae were fed one of two diets or starved. One diet was composed of cyanobacterial cells, which are deficient in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the other was a mixed diet rich in PUFAs. Freshly metamorphosed animals from the starvation treatment had a carbon content per individual 70% lower than that of larvae fed the mixed diet. This apparent exhaustion of larval internal reserves resulted in a 50% reduction of the post-metamorphic growth rates. Growth was also reduced in animals previously fed the cyanobacterial diet. Hence, low food quantity or low food quality during the larval stage of D. polymorpha, lead to irreversible effects for post-metamorphic animals and are related to inferior competitive abilities.

The diatoms are ranked along resource ratio gradients according to their relative abilities to grow under limitation by Si, N, P, and light. Hypotheses based on resource physiology can be integrated with observations on seasonal changes in diatom assemblages to explain the present distributions of diatoms and to test the causal factors proposed to explain diatom distributions over the Holocene. Knowledge of the limnology of these lakes and process-oriented physiology provide the basis for a more detailed interpretation of the paleorecord and a firmer basis for landscape-level transfer functions for fine-scale climate reconstruction.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1996	41	5					1052	1062		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1052	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1052													WOS:A1996VN45800028

However, it is currently insufficiently monitored. In this study, we present a methodology for mapping FRA harvested areas in the Senegal River Valley that is both reproducible and scalable. Our methodology entails the integration of optical and radar data from Sentinel platforms, conducted through a multitemporal analysis with a seasonal focus, and the application of the Random Forest algorithm. The results, supported by a kappa coefficient of 91.9%, demonstrate the first comprehensive mapping of FRA in the Senegal River valley, conducted between 2019 and 2023. This mapping facilitates the identification of the hydrological factors that influence FRA harvesting. The results of the analyses have demonstrated the importance of interannual variability in the cultivated areas of FRA, which range from 14,000 to 75,000 ha depending on the intensity of the annual flood. The duration and flooded extension are the primary factors that regulate the cropping pattern of FRA over the floodplain. The flood duration must be around 35 days to permit the cultivation, with growth generally starting between 10 and 30 November. In consideration of these findings, we recommend that future water management strategies and rural development initiatives give due consideration to FRA, to enhance the visibility of farmers.

The spatiotemporal evaluation of methane (CH4) emission, and CS throughout the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons was carried out in the Purbasthali wetland, an oxbow lake, situated in the Purba Burdwan region of West Bengal, India. Standard process-based mathematical equations were applied to compute the net CS. Various soil and water variables were also observed spatiotemporally and a machine learning-based artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to find out the major factor influencing CS. Moreover, the net CS along with water quality index (WQI) was used to assess the ecological restoration in this lake. The study showed that emission was higher in the monsoon months (1083.59 +/- 56.54 gCO2e m-2 yr-1), whereas CS was higher (2411.88 +/- 72.26 gCO2e m-2 yr-1) in the post-monsoon season. The average total net CS in the Purbasthali throughout the study was 13.96 +/- 8.35 tCO2e ha-1 yr-1. The ANN model revealed that dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature are most important features that influence net CS. These findings can be utilized to develop an effective monitoring system aimed at optimizing CS rates, reducing CH4 emissions, and identifying ecological imbalances. The observed variations in net CS and WQI for the Purbasthali wetland are linked to shifts in wetland usage patterns and the seasonal enhancement of ecosystem services. Notably, the positive net CS indicates improved environmental conditions within the lake and its surroundings, reflecting the success of restoration efforts undertaken by the local community and government. On a global scale, restored and constructed wetlands have proven to be highly effective in carbon storage, pollutant removal, and habitat improvement, contributing significantly to climate goals and urban sustainability objectives. The work was inclined to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 14.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2025	33	1							21	10.1007/s11273-025-10036-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-025-10036-5													WOS:001413343400001

The chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a key indicator of river eutrophication. Until now, there has been a lack of empirical research exploring the Chl-a trend in inland water in Jiujiang in the context of hydrological extremes. In this study, Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, along with hourly water quality data collected from monitoring stations in Jiujiang city, Jiangxi Province, China, are utilized to develop a quantitative inversion model for the Chl-a concentration. The Chl-a concentrations for various inland water types were estimated for each quarter from 2020 to 2022, and the spatiotemporal distribution was analyzed. The main findings are as follows: (1) the quantitative inversion model for the Chl-a concentration was validated via in situ measurements, with a coefficient of determination of 0.563; (2) the spatial estimates of the Chl-a concentration revealed a slight increasing trend, increasing by 0.1193 mu g/L from 2020 to 2022, closely aligning with the monitoring-station data; (3) an extreme drought in 2022 led to less water in inland water bodies, and consequently, the Chl-a concentration displayed a significant upward trend, especially in Poyang Lake, where the mean Chl-a concentration increased by approximately 1 mu g/L from Q1 to Q2 in 2022. These findings revealed the seasonal changes in the Chl-a concentrations in inland waters in the context of extreme hydrological events, thus providing valuable information for the sustainable management of water quality in Jiujiang city.					; Adam, Elhadi/R-2647-2016	Jiang, Wei/0000-0003-4253-3019; long, teng fei/0000-0003-3572-4415; Adam, Elhadi/0000-0003-3626-5839; Ding, Xiaohui/0000-0002-9904-5369														2220-9964				FEB	2025	14	2							85	10.3390/ijgi14020085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi14020085													WOS:001430370600001

The study revealed significant (p < 0.05) seasonal variations in pH, magnesium, and dissolved oxygen levels exceeding permissible limits. Hydrogeochemical classification indicated Cl--Ca2+/Mg2+ facies dominance post-monsoon. Entropy-based WQI results showed excellent water quality during the monsoon, which declined to good (67% samples) and medium (33% samples) post-monsoon. The trophic state index (TSI) indicated hyper-eutrophication, with values of 81.81 and 82.61. Heavy metals were within safe limits during the monsoon, but high cadmium and lead concentrations were found post-monsoon in the western (Karballa) and southeastern sides (Hallalpur) of the Bhojtal wetland. The study emphasizes the need for land use management to protect water quality, especially post-monsoon. The study signifies the anthropogenic impact on historically significant artificial freshwater wetlands regarding water quality, hydrogeochemistry, and heavy metal pollution, emphasizing the crucial role of effective land use management to sustain these freshwater wetlands for better human health and livelihood.

J	Nakayama, T				Nakayama, Tadanobu			Impact of Settling and Resuspension on Plastic Dynamics During Extreme Flow and Their Seasonality in Global Major Rivers	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Environmental contamination by plastics has been receiving considerable attention from scientists, policymakers and the public over the last few decades. Though some of the models have succeeded in simulating the transport and fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems, a complete model is now being developed to clarify the dynamic characteristics of the plastic budget on a continental scale. Recently, the author linked two process-based eco-hydrology models, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology) and NICE-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycle), to a plastic debris model that accounts for both the transport and fate of plastic debris (advection, dispersion, diffusion, settling, dissolution and biochemical degradation by light and temperature), and applied this new model on a regional scale and also for global major rivers. The present study newly incorporated resuspension and bedload transport by extending the author's previous investigations. The simulated results showed that large-sized micro-plastics were distributed more in riverbeds than in river water. Although small-sized micro-plastics are suspended in the water and large-sized micro-plastics settle in the riverbed under normal flow, floods disturb this equilibrium completely and resuspend large-sized micro-plastics in the water. Because the percentage of exported micro-plastic load stored in the riverbed during flood periods is relatively high in some global major rivers, the amount of plastic deposited in riverbeds might be smaller than in lakes and dams. The riverine plastic transport to the ocean revised in the present study was 1.218 +/- 0.393 Tg/yr, with macro-plastic flux 0.793 +/- 0.305 Tg/yr and micro-plastic flux 0.426 +/- 0.248 Tg/yr, being within the range of previous values, that is, 0.41-4.0 Tg/yr. These results aid the development of solutions and measures for the reduction of plastic input to the ocean, and help to quantify the magnitude of plastic transport under climate change.

This research is designed to identify critical junctures in the time series of annual precipitation data, leading to abrupt shifts in trends across various segments of the Lake Chad River Basin. Annual and seasonal rainfall data spanning forty-one years (1981-2021) were collected from twenty-five monitoring stations, sourced from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website. The time series data were assessed for serial correlation and non-parametric statistical tests, (Mann-Kendall (MK), Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SMK)) at 5% significance level. Results revealed that 28% of the locations exhibited statistically significant inter-annual increases in rainfall, while 20% displayed statistically significant inter-annual decreases. Furthermore, 32% of the locations recorded statistically significant upward trends in inter-seasonal rainfall, while 8% indicated statistically significant declines. The application of the SMK test unveiled that 48% of the locations experienced statistically significant sudden alterations in inter-annual rainfall, with a similar abrupt shift occurring in 40% of the locations for inter-seasonal rainfall. These erratic precipitation patterns are significantly impacting water resources management and this has global implications.

Light, temperature, rainfall, turbidity and salinity were expected to be the main factors affecting the seasonal succession. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton were similar at surface water and 1m depth. A total of 130 taxa belonging to Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanophyta, Dinophyta, Xantophyta, Chrysophyta and Cryptophyta divisions were identified.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY					Conference on Relationships Between Ecological and Chemical Status of Surface Waters (REBECCA)	MAY 21-24, 2007	Oslo, NORWAY					The Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000) defines macrophytes as one of the biological groups required for the ecological assessment of European surface waters. Several indices for macrophyte assessment have been proposed or are currently in use by different European states. As a first step towards performing an intercalibration of these indices a common dataset was developed. This dataset contains abundance data on 789 macrophyte species from 316 different lake sites in ten European countries. Various common species and genera were identified as indicators of reference and impacted conditions within the dataset. Cluster analysis of macrophyte data, supported by non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicated that clusters formed were more reflective of their source country rather than lake type. This might be caused by differences in regional climate, biogeography, monitoring techniques, or a combination of these factors. A total of six national indices were applied to assign quality classes to the lakes. However, this produced results that often differed by one or two quality classes for the same site. We foresee that a more precise intercalibration exercise is necessary, and it should be based on more detailed data considering both seasonality and the latitudinal differences within the area covered.

J	Gangl, RS; Pereira, DL				Gangl, RS; Pereira, DL			Biological performance indicators for evaluating exploitation of Minnesota's large-lake Walleye fisheries	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We examined the potential for using biological performance indicators (BPIs) to detect the overexploitation of populations of walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum) in Minnesota's large lakes. We developed equations to predict growth (i.e., the von Bertalanffy growth parameter and total length at age 3) and female age at 50% maturity from growing season length and female total length at 50% maturity from growth. Indices of spawning stock age diversity and the variation of population abundance were characterized by means of summary statistics. Thresholds for BPIs were determined by adding a measure of variability to the predicted and mean values. We evaluated the sensitivity of each BPI by comparing observed values with the thresholds for an overexploited population in Upper Red Lake. All six BPIs for Upper Red Lake exceeded the thresholds, demonstrating their potential use for monitoring walleye exploitation. However, the magnitude by which each threshold was exceeded differed by BPI, indicating that some may be more sensitive than others. Managers should integrate the performance of a suite of BPIs with time series analysis to identify the onset of overexploitation of large-lake walleye fisheries.																			0275-5947					NOV	2003	23	4					1303	1311		10.1577/M01-229AM	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M01-229AM													WOS:000187125200025

Changes in lake sturgeon spawning periodicity is associated with prior reproductive effort	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Long-lived iteroparous organisms vary resource expenditures toward migration and reproduction in response to individual physical factors and conspecific interactions, which can affect future reproductive timing and interval. Reproductive actions can lead to trade-offs associated with allocations to current vs. future reproduction, including longer reproductive interval, require additional study. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between physical stream characteristics, individual behaviors, and breeding demographics and spawning periodicity in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). We used Radio Frequency Identification tags to monitor spawning migration by male (N = 1931) and female (N = 683) adults over seven consecutive years (2016 through 2022) in the Black River, Cheboygan Co., MI. We used ordinal regression models to quantify associations. Male spawning periodicity (1.60 +/- 0.63 years; mean +/- SE) decreased with increasing body size and intra-sex interactions and increased with increasing cumulative temperature, discharge, number of inter-sex interactions, and complete river migrations in a season. Female spawning periodicity (3.19 +/- 0.05 years, mean +/- SE) decreased with increasing upstream swimming time and inter-sex interactions. Results demonstrated spawning periodicity shortened as male lake sturgeon age, and future breeding opportunities decreased, while female periodicity may be more individualized and is more likely to be affected by resource acquisition.

Late Miocene lacustrine sedimentation in the Mytilinii Basin, Samos Island, Greece	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Mytilinii Basin, eastern Samos Island, Greece, is one of many basins that developed in southeastern Europe during the Upper Neogene. The oldest lacustrine portion is of Late Miocene age, and besides tuffs, includes bituminous limestones, marlstones, dolostones and porcelanites of the Pythagorion Formation, and the limestones and diatomites of the overlying Hora Beds. Younger sedimentary rocks of Turolian through Pliocene age partially covered the Pythagorion Formation and Hora Beds (PFHB). Diatom floras range from well preserved to highly corroded and from sparse to abundant. The main taxa include Cyclotella aegaea, C. aegaea var. pythagoria, an unidentified Cyclotella and Nitzschia frustulum, and less common Epithemia turgida, E. reichelti, Synedra ulna, Tryblionella granulata, Encyonema silesiaca, Diploneis ovalis and Cocconeis placentula. Chrysophyte cysts, Hydrobia molluscs and trace fossils occur sporadically. The environmental evolution of the PFHB can be divided into three major stages. Fluctuating shallow to deeper waters in a saline lake characterized Stage A. Saline lake and playa environments with evidence for frequent earthquake events in the form of convolute bedding, drape folds and brecciated sediments characterized Stage B. During Stage C, the lake may have partially or completely split into two separate lakes. In the southeast, a saline playa passed laterally into a deeper-water lake. Locally, fresher-water ponds occurred. Subsequently, a deeper, possibly oligotrophic lake developed. In contrast, a saline lake with abundant diatoms formed in the northwest of the basin, in which diatom blooms led to whiting events and deposition of carbonate laminae. Cyclotella dominated the early floras in this water body, with later assemblages being co-dominated by Cyclotella and Nitzschia frustulum, possibly reflecting seasonal changes. Sedimentation was terminated by uplift and (or) increasing aridity associated with the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

J	Garmouma, M; Poissant, L				Garmouma, M; Poissant, L			Occurrence, temperature and seasonal trends of α- and γ-HCH in air (Quebec, Canada)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric concentrations of alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were measured during 1993-1995 along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. Average alpha- and gamma-HCH concentrations (pg/m(3)) were St. Anicet: 93-101; Villeroy: 92-42; Mingan: 96-20, respectively. alpha-HCH mean concentrations were similar in all sites and appeared to be more influenced by long-range transport than local sources. gamma-HCH mean levels in St. Anicet were 2 and 5 times higher than in Villeroy and Mingan, respectively. The time-series of gamma-HCH air concentrations at St. Anicet and Villeroy were characterised by highly elevated springtime episodes, which are in agreement with the gamma-HCH usage in Quebec as corn seed dressing pesticide. No temporal trend was observed for the alpha-HCH in air. Clausius-Clapeyron plots (log conc. vs. 1/T) showed a stronger correlation between temperature and measured gamma-HCH concentrations at St. Anicet and Villeroy than Mingan. On a regional scale, the influence of the local sources of gamma-HCH implied a seasonal variability in air concentrations due to its short transport, while at the background site (Mingan), the observed alpha- and gamma-HCH concentrations in air were the result of its long-range transport and/or water/air gas exchanges.

Toxaphene concentrations (calculated using technical toxaphene) in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from the western basin of Lake Superior (N = 95) averaged (+/-SD) 889 +/- 896 ng/g wet wt and 60 +/- 34 ng/g wet wt in Siskiwit Lake. Major congeners in lake trout were B8-789 (P38), B8-2226 (P44), B9-1679 (P50), and B9-1025 (P62). Toxaphene concentrations were found to vary seasonally, especially in lower food web organisms in Lake Superior and to a lesser extent in Siskiwit Lake. Toxaphene concentrations declined significantly in lake herring (Coregonus artedii), rainbow smelt (Omerus mordax), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) as well as in zooplankton (> 102 mum) and Mysis (Mysis relicta) between May and October. The seasonal variation may reflect seasonal shifts in the species abundance within the zooplankton community. Trophic magnification factors (TMF) derived from regressions of toxaphene congener concentrations versus delta(15)N were > 1 for most octa- and nonachlorobornanes in Lake Superior except B8-1413 (P26) and B9-715. Log bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for toxaphene congeners in lake trout (ng/g lipid/ng/L dissolved) ranged from 4.54 to 9.7 and were significantly correlated with log octanol-water partition coefficients. TMFs observed for total toxaphene and congener B9-1679 in Lake Superior were similar to those in Arctic lakes, as well as to previous studies in the Great Lakes, which suggests that the bioaccumulation behavior of toxaphene is similar in pelagic food webs of large, cold water systems. However, toxaphene concentrations were lower in lake trout from Siskiwit Lake and lakes in northwestern Ontario than in Lake Superior possibly because of shorter food chains and greater reliance on zooplankton or other pelagic invertebrates.					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; 													0380-1330						2004	30	2					316	340		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70350-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70350-0													WOS:000223086800010

Traps were deployed at multiple depths (25 m below water surface to 5 m above sediments) at varying distances from shore (0.5-21 km) during the months May-October over a 3-year period. Material captured in the sediment traps was analyzed for total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), total copper (Cu), (210)Pb, and stable isotope ratios of C and N. Copper in sediment trap material, a tracer for mine residues, indicated transport of material in both directions along the peninsula. Cross-margin transport of material occurred at all trap locations along the coast and in all seasons. The most significant finding was that sediment traps suspended just below the thermocline collected large amounts of resuspended sediments even when the trap was moored in 120-220 m of water (9-21 km from shore). Estimates of the contribution to settling fluxes of organic carbon from resuspended sediments ranged from 10-30% in offshore traps; estimates based on (210)Pb agreed well with estimates based on a carbon mixing model. Element ratios suggest that resuspended material in offshore traps originated in near-shore regions. Despite the strong influence of resuspension on the composition of sedimenting material, stable isotope ratios were controlled by processes occurring in the water column. Seasonal variations in isotope ratios may reflect seasonal shifts between predominance by autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the water column.					; Apul, Defne/G-5178-2017	Urban, Noel/0000-0002-3586-0399; Apul, Defne/0000-0003-0753-1106													0380-1330						2004	30			1			147	161		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70383-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70383-4													WOS:000227991500011
J	Suzuki, R; Nomaki, T; Yasunari, T				Suzuki, R; Nomaki, T; Yasunari, T			Spatial distribution and its seasonality of satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and climate in Siberia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) distribution and its seasonal cycle were investigated in relation to temperature and precipitation over Siberia and its surrounding regions. The analyses used 5-year (1987-1991) monthly means. The monthly mean NDVI was calculated from the third-generation monthly Global Vegetation Index (GVI) product; monthly temperature and precipitation at 611 stations were calculated from Global Daily Summary (GDS) data. The 611 stations were classified by cluster analysis into 10 classes based on the NDVI seasonal cycle (March-October). The geographical distribution characteristics of the NDVI cycle were described using temperature, precipitation and Olson's land-cover type. In northern regions, where tundra vegetation prevails and temperatures and precipitation are low, the amplitude of the NDVI seasonal cycle is small. In southern regions, where temperatures are high and there is little precipitation, the seasonal amplitude of the NDVI is small because of the and land type. Forested regions were split into six classes, each characterized by large amplitudes in the NDVI seasonal cycle. The phenological characteristics of the forest classes were noted. For example, a forest-class localized near Lake Baikal shows higher NDVI values, even with the presence of snow cover in March, compared with other regions. This high NDVI value suggests that the exposed green canopy of the coniferous forest can be observed even when snow is present. In addition, the NDVI peaks at stations near 60 degreesN, where the maximum monthly temperature is around 18 degreesC. This result suggests that the optimum temperature-precipitation environment coincides to the area in Siberia where the maximum monthly temperature is 18 degreesC.

However, the loss of soil P due to shallow groundwater table (SGT) fluctuations driven by seasonal changes is often neglected, and the migration and transformation mechanisms of soil P are still unclear. On the basis of the long-term monitoring of cropland soil P accumulation and SGT fluctuations around Erhai Lake, the characteristics of soil P loss driven by SGT fluctuations and the corresponding mechanisms were investigated through a 260-day microcosm experiment. The results revealed that the fluctuations in SGT significantly changed the content and form of P in the soil profile. The soil P loss mainly occurred in dissolved form, mainly involving inorganic P, accounting for 75 %. Compared with those under continuous saturated conditions, soil total P (TP) release during SGT fluctuations significantly increased by 9.5 %, and soil TP storage was reduced by 2 %. SGT fluctuations increased the complexity of microbial networks in the soil profile, stimulated the expression of functional genes for soil P cycling, and promoted soil organic P mineralization. The SGT fluctuations caused an increase in the soil TP loss from cropland to 88.5 kg/ha, which was 70 and 25 times greater than that via leaching and runoff, respectively. These results indicated that SGT fluctuations accelerated the P loss from soil profile of cropland. Therefore, some measures should be comprehensively applied to prevent its loss, such as reducing external P input, improving surface soil P storage capacity and soil P utilization efficiency, reducing surface P leaching into deep soil, and reducing P accumulation in deep soil profiles.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				MAY 1	2025	275								123209	10.1016/j.watres.2025.123209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123209		JAN 2025						39884049					WOS:001457420100001
J	Özseven, A; Akkurt, I				Ozseven, Alper; Akkurt, Iskender			Evaluation of gross-alpha and gross-beta activity concentrations and assessment of excess lifetime cancer risk in waters of Egirdir Lake, Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Egirdir Lake is the fourth largest lake in Turkey and located in Isparta province. It is one of the most important water sources in Goller District. Egirdir Lake supplies water to the Egirdir basin and most of the agricultural lands were irrigated through Egirdir Lake and it is also used as drinking water in adjacent provinces. Evaluating the gross-alpha and gross-beta activity concentrations can be accepted as the first step of determining the natural radioactivity level of water. The aim of this study is to investigate the natural radioactivity level of Egirdir Lake surface water by measuring gross-alpha and gross-beta activity concentrations. Study was conducted in two different seasons, in order to evaluate the seasonal effect on results. Seasonal average activity concentrations of gross-alpha and gross-beta varied in a range of 0.0125-0.0345 Bq/L and 0.0750-0.1 Bq/L, respectively. Mean activity concentrations of gross-alpha and gross-beta for seasonal averages were 0.0215 +/- 0.0057 Bq/L and 0.0833 +/- 0.008 Bq/L, respectively. From the measured activities, annual effective dose and excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) were calculated. The obtained ELCR results varied in the range of 0.0157%-0.0202% with arithmetic mean of 0.0173%. In addition to that, statistical analyses were carried out in order to investigate the significances of the results. Resultant values exhibited that gross-alpha and gross-beta activities were found to be lower than suggested limits of WHO screening procedure. These results indicated that water consumption-related annual effective dose due to internal irradiation is less than 0.1 mSv/year and the water of Egirdir Lake is of low risk to use as drinking water and also for multiple purposes.					; ÖZSEVEN, ALPER/AAH-3573-2020; akkurt, iskender/AGP-2700-2022	OZSEVEN, ALPER/0000-0001-6128-6426; akkurt, iskender/0000-0002-5247-7850; 													0306-7319	1029-0397				DEC 28	2022	102	18					7033	7045		10.1080/03067319.2020.1822352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2020.1822352		OCT 2020											WOS:000579375300001

Browsing impact of large herbivores on Acacia xanthophloea Benth in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in growth of plant height, canopy cover and stem diameter of Acacia xanthophloea trees in fenced plot as compared with unfenced plot both in the wet and in the dry seasons. Finding of this study showed that although heavy browsing reduced the height and canopy of trees, it did not kill any trees and seedling regeneration took place simultaneously. Despite the presence of large herbivores that impact some considerable browsing pressure results indicate that the A. xanthophloea habitat type would continue to remain in balance in the presence of recruitment of seedlings and saplings. The conditions at the time of study indicate that the browsing on A. xanthophloea was not significant and was not serious enough to warrant management intervention at present.

MOGAPELWA: ARCHAEOLOGY PALAEOENVIRONMENT AND ORAL TRADITIONS AT LAKE NGAMI, BOTSWANA	SOUTH AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL BULLETIN												The Lake Ngami Basin is important for understanding the LSA record during the Holocene in the Kalahari. We provide an OSL and radiocarbon dated sequence that relates changing lake levels to the stratigraphy and archaeology of Mogapelwa 1. At intervals during the last 16 ka the site offered easy access to the resources of a flowing Nchabe River and all expanded Lake Ngami. From 6.4-3.3 ka, except for a brief interval of lower lake levels at c. 4.3 ka, Lake Ngami was a permanent, extensive water body with all elevation near 936 in, at least seasonally. At Mogapelwa this was the time of the main LSA occupation during what was the longest period of high lake levels of the Holocene. This little-known period at Lake Ngami is of great interest because it pre-dates the arrival of Bambata pottery and livestock. Artefacts are highlighted by microliths such as segments, distally backed points, double backed drills and small scrapers. Bone points similar to arrow points or link shafts used by Kalahari San were found us were ostrich egg shell beads including unique clusters of ochre-stained beads. A wild fauna is associated that includes animals found in the area at present, or historically. Fish remains include the first discovery of otoliths ('earstones') of cichlids from the region where the adaptive radiation of cichlids is thought to have occurred. Mollusc species indicate the long-term presence of hosts of bilharzia. The lake level dropped from 3.3-2.5 ka but rose to about 934 in in the period 2.5-1 ka, At c. 0.3-0.2 ka the lake level rose to historical levels of 930-929 in as observed by early Europeans who visited the region in the 1850s. Oral traditions reveal a recent history Of multi-ethnic use of the area by San, Bakgalagadi and other groups. The most recent archaeological deposits containing fish bones and remnants of a possible hut floor are discussed in relation to oral traditions and documentary evidence.					; Klein, Richard/B-5910-2009; Steele, Teresa/IUQ-8272-2023	Steele, Teresa/0000-0002-3091-6488; Klein, Richard/0000-0002-6180-2168; Hitchcock, Robert/0000-0001-8110-0289													0038-1969					JUN	2009	64	189					13	32																WOS:000271549400003

However, the actual threat posed by the introduced cichlids cannot be assessed without data on the local feeding habits of all three species. This paper describes the diet of O. hunteri and both introduced species, focusing on seasonal changes in food-source availability. Microscopic analysis of gut content in 35 fishes collected over a 20-month period was compared with the composition of littoral food sources and seasonal variation in the limnetic phytoplankton and complemented with exploratory stable-isotope analysis of fish tissue. We found that all three tilapiines in Lake Chala are herbivorous, and during most of the year, they feed on algae and organic detritus on and between rocks in the littoral zone. However, in July-September they migrate to open water to feed on blooming phytoplankton. Interspecific differences in gut content and stable-isotope composition suggest that O. hunteri may have a competitive advantage over the two newcomers by making better use of this seasonal extra food resource. However, this advantage may erode when continuing climate change starts affecting the bloom's predictability.					; Dieleman, Jorunn/LKK-7898-2024	Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; Verschuren, Dirk/0000-0002-9116-5446; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2021	848	16			SI		3763	3777		10.1007/s10750-020-04427-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04427-3		OCT 2020											WOS:000576538700001

Spatiotemporal dynamics of cyanobacterium Dolichospermum lemmermannii populations in a bloom-prone region of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (cHABs) are increasingly common in marine and freshwater environments, including the Laurentian Great Lakes (LGL). Lake Superior has seen two large-scale cyanobacterial blooms (2012 and 2018) along the Wisconsin shoreline west of the Apostle Islands, caused by the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum lemmermannii. The drivers of bloom formation in Lake Superior are not yet certain, with many factors known to trigger blooms elsewhere in the LGL being absent in Lake Superior. Furthermore, little is known about D. lemmermannii's spatial structure or phenology. Thus, we sought to track the seasonal population dynamics of D. lemmermannii to shed light on its growth, physiology, and abundance. In 2021, we used 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of D. lemmermannii abundance and diversity along the bloom-prone Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior. In 2022, we performed net tows and direct colony counts in another localized area. No large-scale bloom event was observed during either year, though several smaller localized blooms were observed. D. lemmermannii abundances were low at nearly all sites and sampling times. Spikes in abundance occurred in July and September, particularly near Siskiwit Bay, a hotspot of bloom formation. We also observed a seasonal shift in heterocyte and akinete abundance indicative of late-season nutrient limitation. Most striking was the seasonal turnover of D. lemmermannii strains, suggesting strain adaptation to specific environmental conditions. These results offer valuable and actionable insights for managers and provide a foundation for additional work to clarify drivers of bloom formation in Lake Superior.					; Callaghan, Jake/HZH-2975-2023; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013	Sheik, Cody/0000-0003-0413-1924; Alexson, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3731-5925; 													0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102455	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102455		JAN 2025											WOS:001410029900001

Microbial contamination of water bodies is causing major environmental and public health concerns in developing countries. Bacterial inclusion of inland waters can be of allochthonous and/or autochthonous origins. Goals. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the microbial contamination with environmental factors controlling colonization of bacteria in lagoon-lakes and freshwater lakes. Methods. Two lagoon-lakes and two freshwater lakes in Turkish Thrace were chosen and sampling was undertaken from October 2014 to August 2015 at seasonal intervals. While total heterotrophic bacteria, E. coli, coliform, and fecal coliform bacteria distributions from allochthonous and autochthonous origins were determined, environmental conditions of the ecosystems were also measured. While the Bray-Curtis Similarity Index and the Correspondence Analysis with Abundance Plot Analyses were used to determine the similarities of the sampling habitats, the Spearman's Correlation Index was applied to clarify relationships between the environmental variables and the bacterial distribution. Results. The bacterial distribution was positively related to dissolved oxygen in one of the sampled lagoon-lakes (r = 1.0, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with total dissolved solids and salinity in one of the sampled freshwater lakes (r = -0.95, p < 0.01; r = -0.80, p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions. This research indicated that the saline water of the lagoon-lakes has limited the number of bacteria when compared with freshwater lakes.

In this case, it is difficult to carry out any data analysis and their evaluation. This paper presents one of the chemometric techniques-principal component analysis (PCA)-used to classify water quality indices on data that contain missing elements. The surface water of Czajcze Lake in Wolin National Park (northwestern Poland) was investigated. Sixteen water-quality indices were appointed in a period from April to October during 1983-2013. Conducted analysis of experimental data by EM-PCA grouped the presented water quality indices in natural clusters, including several principal components (PCs) about similar features. EM-PCA applied in the present work shows that this method can be used to analyze experimental data with missing data on considerable seasonal changes.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2018	27	1					19	30		10.15244/pjoes/74367	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/74367													WOS:000419793200003

To determine the genetic background of the high organophosphate mineralization rate in river mouth areas of eutrophic lakes, we compared the diversity and abundance of bacterial alkaline phosphatase PhoX-encoding genes in the river mouth areas and the lake center within the large eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. Results showed that the seasonal average values of phosphorus content, bacterial alkaline phosphatase activity, diversity, and abundance of bacterial phoX in the river mouths were significantly higher than those in the lake center, and 47% of all identified genotypes were present only in the river mouths. The genotypes most similar to alphaproteobacterial phoX dominated in both regions, with 72% and 64% of the total genotypes in the lake center and river mouths, respectively. More than 40% of the total phoX genotypes were only found in the river mouths, however, indicating the special microbial nature in this hypereutrophic habitat. The differences in contents of dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus were related to the divergences of bacterial phoX genotypes in these two contrasting habitats. Because some dominant genotypes most similar to phoX genes of alphaproteobacterial genus were observed only in the river mouth areas, such as Microvirga sp.

Thirty-five samples were examined for two years in order to perform: a) their actual contamination; b) the daily dietary exposure of seafood consumers to the pollutants in question. In all the clams analysed in this study, PCB and OCP (4,4-DDE) residues are always below the limits fixed by law. It seems that there is some seasonality of concentrations observed. In fact the more high concentrations of residues are detected in the hot months, for both species and years. Given the consumption of clams and the values obtained in this study for the two species analysed, it is possible estimate that the average daily dietary intake of NDL-PCB and of 4,4-DDE for adults is really low.

In this study, the relationships of Pseudomonas spp. strains with specific biomarkers of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in wild fish Chirostoma jordani, as well as the capacity of these bacteria to biotransfonn PAHs were evaluated. The activity of the naphthalene dioxygenase system of the bacteria exposed to 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mu g/L of PAHs was higher than the mean isoform 1A1 (CYP 1A1) of the wild fish, particularly bacterial species related to Pseudomonas spp. However, the epoxide hydrolase activity of the strains was lower in all cases compared to the fish. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of the bacterial strains was lower than in the liver, but higher than in viscera of C. jordani. Using redundancy analysis, two differential patterns were found: (i) CYP1A1 activity of fish was induced by naphthalene and aiuhracene water levels independently of sampling season and lakes monitored, and (ii) the unidentified strain of the Pseudomonas genus biotransfonns the endogenous levels of benm [a]py rene, benzo[k]fluoranthene and indeno[1,2.3-cd]pyrene in the fish allowing the hydroxylated metabolites to conjugate with glutathione through GST activity of the fish.

Effect of season on the fatty acid profile of total lipids, phospholipids and triacylglycerols in Mastacembelus mastacembelus (Ataturk Dam Lake, Turkey)	GRASAS Y ACEITES												The present study investigated the lipid content and FA profiles of total lipids, phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TAG) of Mastacembelus mastacembelus from the Ataturk Dam Lake (Turkey). The results showed that the total lipid content of the dorsal muscle varied seasonally from 0.50% to 3.59%. Wide ranges of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (36.21 to 50.52%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (25.22 to 42.02%) were found in the PL fraction. However, higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (37.63 to 45.07%) and SFA (34.71 to 38.82%) were found in TAG (triacylglycerol). The ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFA ranged from 0.65 to 1.32 and 1.07 to 3.48 in PL (phospholipid) and TAG fraction, respectively. The results also showed that the major components were palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1 omega-9), palmitoleic acid (C16:1 omega-7), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 omega-3), arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4 omega-6) and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 omega-3) in total lipid, C16:0, C18:1 omega-9, AA and DHA in PL, C16:0, C16:1 omega-7, C18:1 omega-9, linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 omega-6), and DHA in TAG extracted from the muscle of M. mastacembelus in all seasons.					; kaçar, semra/H-3928-2015	kacar, semra/0000-0002-9869-9045; 													0017-3495	1988-4214				JAN-MAR	2018	69	1							e242	10.3989/gya.1108172	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/gya.1108172													WOS:000428731100012

Status of the large-scale commercial trawl fisheries in southern Lake Malawi	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Great Lakes of the World (GLOW) Conference on Advancing the Ecosystem Approach - Good Governance for Adaptation and Rehabilitation	MAR 24-26, 2015	Mangochi, MALAWI					A study to assess the status of the large scale commercial fisheries operating in southern Lake Malawi was conducted using generalised linear modelling and Principles of Precautionary Approach. The generalised linear modelling analysis was used to standardise catch per unit of effort data from 1976 to 2009 and to determine the effects of fishing vessel characteristics such as engine size and hydro-acoustic devices on fish catch rates. The Precautionary Approach, through reference points like Bmax (reference point corresponding to period of relatively high fish catch rate), Bpa (reference point at which precautionary management action should be undertaken), Blim (limit reference point beyond which a fishery is considered seriously depleted) and Bcur (reference point corresponding to current fish catch rate), was used to assess the status of fish stocks using standardised fish catch rate which approximated fish biomass or stock size.Results of the assessment indicated that the current fish biomass level in all three categories, bottom pair trawl, stern bottom trawl and stern mid-water trawl fisheries, is well above Blim, but is 9-12% above Bpa, which is very close suggesting that the fishery is fully exploited and precautionary management measures are required. Suggested measures included introduction of fishing closed season for the large scale commercial fisheries which will be dependent on the biology of the most important target fish stocks, relocation or reduction of fishing effort in the current fishing grounds and intensification of patrols to reduce incidences of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2018	21	2			SI		121	131		10.1080/14634988.2018.1457388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2018.1457388													WOS:000435329600002

The increase in the atmospheric temperature may have unfavorable effects on the physical environment in deep lakes. In particular, the effects of global warming on the overturn are worried because the overturn plays a key role in supplying oxygen to the bottom layer in deep lakes of the Temperate Zone. The water temperature in the surface layer will represent the similar variation with the atmospheric temperature. The overturn will be ceased if the increasing rate of water temperature is lower in the bottom layer than in the surface layer. Hence, the vertical advection and diffusion of heat have to be examined in order to predict the variation in water temperature in the bottom layer. In the present study, water current and temperature fields were reproduced by a three-dimensional numerical model for Lake Biwa and Lake Ikeda, in which the overturn continues and often stops, respectively. Then the vertical advection and diffusivity were examined in order to understand the mechanism of the variation in water temperature in the bottom layer. As a result, time variations in water temperature were reproduced well by the three-dimensional numerical model in order to examine the mechanism of vertical advection and diffusion of water temperature. The water temperature continued increasing gradually during stratified seasons in deeper waters of Lake Biwa, whereas the increasing rate of water temperature was lower in Lake Ikeda. The absolute values of advection terms were larger in the mixing layer above thermocline because of the wind-driven current. The eddy diffusivity terms play a key role in increasing water temperature in deep waters. The value of vertical eddy diffusivity in deeper waters was larger in Lake Biwa than in Lake Ikeda even at the same depth. The larger value of vertical eddy diffusivity will contribute to the gradual increase in water temperature in deeper waters of Lake Biwa. The larger eddy diffusivity may come from the intermittent large variations in advection term, which may be attributed to wind-driven current, bottom stress, the generation of internal waves and their breaking, etc. The reason of the larger eddy diffusivity in Lake Biwa has be examined precisely as future works.

Corbicula japonica predominantly inhabited the upstream section of the primary branch and Kensaki stream of the Ohashi River, whereas A. senhousia predominantly inhabited the downstream section of the Ohashi River. However, the distributions were highly variable among stations and seasons. Intrusions of saline water from Lake Nakaumi varied with astronomical and climatological factors, and consequently, the halocline of the Ohashi River is subject to spatiotemporal changes. Changes in distributions of C. japonica and A. senhousia occurred in relation to a flood event, indicating that environmental disturbances affect the distributions of the two bivalve species. Responses of the two species to continual saline water intrusion were also observed during the period of normal flow conditions. We suggest that the distribution of the two species is closely related to the dynamics of the ambient saline water, which is the most important factor correlated to changes in the distributions of C. japonica and A. senhousia in the Ohashi River.																			1745-1000	1745-1019					2018	14	5					484	496		10.1080/17451000.2018.1428754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17451000.2018.1428754													WOS:000432246800007

However, there is scant research about littoral zones of reservoirs. In the present study, static closed chamber and gas chromatograph techniques were used to measure methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux in the littoral area of a temperate reservoir from 2009 to 2010. The littoral area comprises three zones, namely supralittoral, eulittoral and infralittoral. The patterns of CH4 and CO2 emissions from these three littoral zones were significantly different during the sampling periods, with the eulittoral zone having the highest CH4 flux and the supralittoral zone having the highest CO2 flux. Temperature and biomass correlated with CH4 and CO2 emissions. Measurement of CO2 emissions after removing vegetation varied in each zone and according to time of sampling. A large littoral area of the reservoir sampled herein will be submerged and converted to a pelagic area with deep standing water after the South to North Water Transfer Project is completed, in 2050. The results of the present study suggest further research and monitoring are needed, and should focus on likely effects of extreme climate events and the effects of human-mediated factors on greenhouse gas emissions.					ting, lei/GQB-4028-2022; Li, Gang/AAB-8254-2019; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021; Bridgewater, Peter/AAA-2810-2020	/0000-0001-9097-4105; Wu, Shu-Hong/0000-0002-6654-011X; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2018	69	5			SI		751	763		10.1071/MF17114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF17114													WOS:000430319400013

However, their consequences on aquatic biota in reservoirs are poorly known. We tested the hypothesis that macroinvertebrate communities are negatively affected by atypical drought events, given the sensitivity of many taxa to environmental changes. We predicted that: (a) there would be changes in limnological and sediment parameters between a regular year and an atypical year, (b) abundance and richness of the genera of Chironomidae and of exotic species would be higher due to the enhanced ability of these organisms to adapt to changes in the physical environment, and (c) community structure metrics (i. richness; ii. % richness; iii. abundance; iv. % abundance) would be affected by disturbance indices (i. Buffer Disturbance Index-BDI; ii. Local Disturbance Index-LDI; iii. Integrated Disturbance Index-IDI) in both years. The study was carried out in the reservoir of the Nova Ponte Hydroelectric Power Plant, state of Minas Gerais, comparing two sampling periods: a regular climatological year (2010) and an atypical drought year (2014). A total of 40 sampling sites were defined along the shore of the reservoir, and types of land use in the surrounding area of each site were measured, as well as physical habitat conditions, sediments, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Sampling was performed at these sites in the end of the rainy season in both years. The intensity of anthropogenic modifications was assessed at local scale and in the areas (buffers) surrounding the sampling sites using quantitative disturbance indices. There were striking differences in limnological parameters and sediment characteristics between sampling periods. Taxonomic richness was significantly lower in the drought year. As opposed to our predictions, richness and abundance of Chironomidae and exotic species did not increase with the atypical drought event. Besides, most community structure metrics showed a significant relationship with disturbance indices only during the regular climatological year, thus indicating that the large-scale effects of water stress may override the conditions of local habitats and the surrounding landscape. Therefore, in addition to a correct political-environmental management of water resources at local-scale, which includes maintaining the water quality and the riparian and landscape integrity, addressing large-scale climate issues is required for the maintenance of the ecological integrity of tropical reservoirs.					; Callisto, Marcos/O-4930-2015; Barbosa, Jose Etham de Lucena/H-2234-2018; Ligeiro, Raphael/K-7791-2015; Molozzi, Joseline/M-3951-2014; de Lucena E.

One of the major concerns is the risk of severe drought leading to water shortages. It will affect water supply and agriculture yields. As a country extremely vulnerable to the climate change, Indonesia must adapt to the serious environmental issues. This paper aims to offer an effort of water provision by recycling and reusing of greywater applying constructed wetland systems. The treated greywater is useful as water provision for non-consumptive uses. A recent experiment was conducted on a household yard using a single horizontal subsurface flow type of constructed wetland. The experiments demonstrated that the constructed wetland systems reduced effectively the pollutants of TSS, BOD, COD, and detergent to the level that are compliant with regulatory standards. The constructed wetland has been established for almost two years however the system still works properly.					; Setyono, Prabang/AAD-9682-2021	setyono, prabang/0000-0001-6440-6083; Ramelan, Ari Handono/0000-0003-0823-3186													1755-1307						2018	129								012002	10.1088/1755-1315/129/1/012002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/129/1/012002													WOS:000445793100002
